1nh835k,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoxBrain/comments/1nh835k/i_dont_know_why_i_kept_going_back/,I dont know why I kept going back.,"I have been on facebook since the beginning. Since when all the updates were ""salutbuton ""is feeling awesome today and wanting to get some coffee."" I stayed on there because I ended up being 8 hours away from my family, and wanted to stay in touch with them. 

For the past 9 months, every time I stop by fb, I am blasted with dogshit. I dont have to go into detail, you know what theyre saying today. I read a boastful post from a long family friend (she was a dear friend of my mother's, and has always been there for me since my mom passed.) but she was gleeful over the ""thousands of leftists"" that have lost their jobs because they didnt mourn kirk. I have talked to her before, and we've kept it civil, we are free to have our own opinions. But I couldn't. I didnt want to let it go. I blew up on her. I rarely curse, but I let it fly. Her and fucking Fox News employed daughter can suck a dick, and the less harmful people in the world, the better it is. 

If time travel becomes possible in the future, please come get me. I want to be taken back to Obama. So I can appreciate him more. Or take us away from this. Away from the foxed up people. 

I need to be held. Ima go take a bath. ",2,1757897659.0,FoxBrain,0,1.0,False
1nh82xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1nh82xo/homophobia_is_never_okay/,Homophobia is NEVER okay! ü§¨,"I was sitting at a bench near Bathurst station here in Toronto, Canada, sipping my iced coffee, and just enjoying a nice day outside. When all of a sudden, I hear a guy hurling slurs and insults, repeatedly saying ""F****T"". He was insulting these two gentlemen who were holding hands. 

One of the guys was ready to throw hands with this moron, but his boyfriend was holding him back, and just told him to ""f*ck off!"". When the couple walked past me, I asked them, ""Are you guys okay?"" One of them said that he's not bothered by it, as if that was just a normal occurence. And of them smiled at me. They both just continued walking, still holding hands, unbothered by the derogatory remarks that still went on in the background.

I'm still a bit shaken now, because I felt like I was personally assaulted, too. I'm a gay man myself. I'm also just heartbroken that these petty things still happen in 2025, especially here in Toronto. But I'm glad about the solidarity that people showed amidst the hatred. The people walking with the couple gave the idiotic homophobe the middle finger, and they were making a protective circle around the couple. I left the scene because I felt unsafe, too. I talked to an elderly gentleman who was there. He told me, ""I don't get it. You're just minding your own business, and then you get assaulted."" I replied to him, ""I don't get the hate, either.""

If you're bothered by same-sex couples just living their best lives, the problem is on you. Don't wag insults like, ""is he your f*ck buddy, huh?"", when we all know that you're not getting any action and spice in the bedroom. Why all the hate? Why all the violence? These two beautiful people displaying their love for each other clearly reflect how ugly, insecure, tiny, and insignificant of a human being you are.

Honestly, I get tired of saying, ""let's be kind to one another, please"", because I feel like kindness has become very scarce these days. But, I would always stand by my queer brothers and sisters.

PLEASE, people!!! For the love of all the gods and goddesses up in the high heavens, let's all just spread love and kindness, okay??? It wouldn't cost you a single dollar to be kind. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà",1,1757897640.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

1nh7y7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/1nh7y7d/would_anyone_be_interested_in_digital_mexican/,Would Anyone Be Interested In Digital Mexican Spanish Immersion Kits?,"So I'm learning Spanish, and due to living in the US wanted to focus on Mexican Spanish. So this includes learning the accent, pronunciation, slang, common expressions, history, culture, etc. I've run into a common problem most people experience which is the resources are kind of hard to come by, or very time consuming to collect and research. I was wondering if people would be interested in a lot of the work being done for them in a google sheet.

For example right now I have a Mexican Movie / Tv show google sheet.

Which has the following:

Title of movie -

Link to the trailer -

Genre of show / movie -

Type of show / movie (Comedy, drama, action, etc) -

The run time -

Brief Description -

Verified that it's Mexican Spanish -

Has a way to rate the show / movie personally with 5 star system on the sheet, and mark if watched -

I could probably do 100 + shows / movies as Ive been gathering trailers for months. I would branch this out into top 100 YouTube channels, top 100 books, top 100 Instagram pages maybe, etc. So let's say you're looking to change your social media to Spanish, bam you have a list. You want channels, the works already done just subscribe to what you want, etc. Meme pages, comedians, actors, singers, influencers, etc. 

You would make a copy of it, and own it to edit as you please. I would offer each list for maybe the price of a coffee because it does take a lot of time to compile. Just curious if people would be interested. I would reinvest the earnings into Anki decks later and hire Native speakers from Mexico for decks later down the line.",1,1757897253.0,Spanish,0,1.0,False

**I want to preface this with, I am likely keeping my Matic! I like it! This feedback is focused on the negatives because I want to see these things improved before I can recommend it to others**

The good

* My floors are visibly cleaner after a vacuum & mop session. So in short - it works! (It better for this price!) In particular I feel like the mopping makes the largest difference which I was fairly surprised by, since I figured robot mopping was still in its early days.
* The team is obviously super passionate and really smart, and the transparency around development and release notes is awesome to see!
* When the robot is confident in what its doing, it does it well.
* My cat is not scared of it at all, and it doesn't bump into her. She watches it cautiously/curiously, but it doesn't move erratically or anything like that

The not so great

* The android app (beta) has hardly any features. I had to install the app on my Macbook to remap my home, merge/label rooms, etc. **However the team has made it clear a big android update is coming in a few weeks and I believe them.**
* I only have hardwood floors, and the performance of the vacuuming is less than I expected. Now, this is an **unfair comparison** because I use a Dyson V15 with the laser fluffy head attachment. Meaning I can REALLY see with the laser what the Matic missed. I would say it cleans up about 80% of the cat hair and dust so my floors look clean to the naked eye, but my Dyson leaves my floors spotless. But occasionally I have seen it miss small bits of plastic etc. that I would expect it to pick up. **Request for the team: please seriously consider creating a fluffy brush roll like the Dyson one, for people with only hardwood floors**. I think this would be a game changer. It's hard to understate how much better a fluffy head is for hardwood, and seems like it would be a very logical accessory product for Matic to design and create.
* Edge cleaning needs some improvements. It does a good job in some areas, and a so-so one in others. I'm not sure why. It also OFTEN says ""cleaning toekicks"" while bringing out the little sweeper out in the open away from any edges. It's bizarre and the detection algorithm probably needs work. I think it may be related to things being moved mid cleaning cycle? In particular where chair legs used to be. It just wastes its own time (which is fine, it's automatic anyways). Mopping around edges also feels like it doesn't get close enough for my liking, but that's a design limitation
* It's not as quiet as I hoped. I don't have a point of reference with other robot vacs, but there is a high pitched whine to the vacuum fan/motor that makes it not possible for me to sleep through from 1 room away. Maybe with carpet the sound would be dampened? I'll just have to schedule it for when I'm out of the house instead of sleeping, minor bummer. But I live alone so that's easy - if you have a busy household, I could see this being a bigger issue.
* The pathing algorithms are imo very confusing/inefficient I feel. I'll see it go across the room to get a small patch when there's larger patches near it. And when the robot gets really confused in the final edge cleaning stage of a room, it'll sometimes freak out and go start on the next room for a minute before coming back to finish the previous room.

The bad

* The robot gets stuck and crashes **often** with edge cases (see attached videos). I don't know if it's just my home, but I have 3 specific problem areas that constantly trip up the robot. 2 out of 3 of them involve crashing into/getting **stuck under things that are** **nearly exactly the robots height: an ikea lack coffee table** (not in video) with the lower level slightly bowed from water damage, and my **under-desk hanging computer mount.** (I can adjust desk height to solve this). The final edge case is hard to describe, but it's small solid objects dangling in its path (my bed frame, see video clip 1). This is solvable with no-go zones. I worry about camera lens scratches a lot from all the bumping.
* It getting stuck/confused in narrow areas leads to it burning through a lot of battery as it tries to take tiny tiny turns to route away. I've already come home to it completely stuck under the ikea table with dead battery once already. And last night a vac+mop session of my whole apartment (4 ""rooms"", \~750sqft) was estimated at \~2.5hr, it actually took closer to 6 hours and the robot had to dock and recharge **twice**. It'll hallucinate getting stuck for \~15 minutes in a spot (see video clip 6) and keep switching between ""cleaning"" and ""planning route"" as it kills its battery doing little micro adjustments trying to turn around, I wish it was more confident to turn and realize nothing is actually blocking it. I have to manually push it out of position so it can snap out of it. That's imo pretty unacceptable because it happens often (especially around chair legs)

Finally I just want to add, I wish there was a way to see the water level of the tank in app, rather than it just runs out. There isn't any kind of water level sensor so that won't be possible for the current hardware, but something for down the line hopefully. Would be great if it knew ahead of time it has the water necessary to finish a mopping so it can warn you

Since we were very young she always got everything she wanted for free or almost nothing and if I wanted something I had to ""pay/work"" for it. This behaviour was mostly enabled by my father (M 53), my mother (F 53) did it as well but to a lesser degree. I've seen through this dynamic quite soon and put in boundaries between my contact with her and our dealings were mostly merit based so after some time she stopped reaching out for my help due to said boundaries and her knowing that with me she won't get free favors due to her being ""a girl"".

As previously mentioned my father is mostly enabling this behaviour and keeps doing so even now ""due to her being his only daughter"". I am was quite distant with her mainly since she got herself a boyfriend who is another of her enablers + a doormat. So our relationship is quite strained.

So the incident rose up last month as I went for a 1-week holiday to Croatia alone and left my house empty. My father had a spare key and asked me if he can go to my house to pickup some stuff, I said sure and forgot about it. He forgot  to mention me a key detail that she will be going there as well. So all 3 of them (Father, her, BF) went to my place and they requested him to let them stay at my house for a few days. Of course my Father ""thought"" I wouldn't mind it so he gave them the spare key and let them stay. They treated my house as their holiday resort for the week while I was travelling. They drank up my coffee and wine, ate up all of my snack bars and pantry got cleared out. Luckily they didn't trash anything up so I was lucky there. As they knew when I will be returning they cleaned up the place good enough that I should not notice until I looked at fine details.

So when I returned, I did notice some stuff not in their place but I did not dwell on it as I remembered that father mentioned that he will be picking up some stuff from my place and I thought that it was due to that. Then after some days as I was working from home I noticed that all of my coffee was gone. Same for the wine, pantry, snacks and quite lot of alcohol amongst other stuff.
I thought I had someone break-in but locks, window and access locations did not seem damaged but then one of my neighbours mentioned to me that while I was on my holiday they've seen my father with a couple at my place.

I immediately called up my father and demanded to know who the heck did he bring to my place without my knowledge and he casually mentioned that he lended my place to my sister and her BF while I was gone. I was pissed. I immediately drove to his place and not so politely told him about how this is done, that house is my place, told how many things are gone and I want the spare key immediately back. There was quite lot of shouting between us and by the end I told him to F off.

Then there is my sister, I messaged her what does she think she's doing and I wonder if I should borrow her car while she ""doesn't need it"" and trash it. Of course she told me I should not make such a big deal out of it, but when I told her I expect all the stuff that is gone needs to be restocked as even in resorts you need to pay for the stuff you use and I am not some charity. Then she told me that due to the fact that I make much more money than her I shouldn't mind her spending my stuff. Also most of the stuff was apparently eaten by her BF.
So I again I lost it, I told her that if doesn't know how to control properly her doormat of a BF then they shouldn't come to my eFing place. I said some other not so nice things and she blocked me and now we are not speaking.

Now after one month it's still the same between her and me, as I am still blocked by her. Not that I mind it.
My father did apologise to me but I clearly told him that I forgive him but I won't be giving him another spare keys and I will be soon adding security system to my place. I will forgive him but definitely not forget.

But now he keeps kinda hinting to me that I should apologise to my sister due to the harsh things I said to her as she's now not visiting him as well due to my and his house being quite close to each other.

But I don't think I should be the one apologising. So Reddit AITAH?",1,1757896714.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Over the past 15 years, I've developed what I call my ""productivity blueprint."" These aren't revolutionary concepts, just practical principles that have helped me get more done while staying sane.

Here's my 8-point system:

1. Start Before You're Ready: Don't wait for perfect conditions or complete knowledge. The best time to start is now, even if you're only 70% prepared. Momentum builds clarity faster than planning ever will.

2. Batch Similar Tasks: Group related activities together instead of jumping between different types of work. Answer all emails at once, make all your calls in one block, do all your creative work during your peak energy hours.

3. Two-Minute Rule: If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. Don't add it to your to-do list, don't schedule it for later. This prevents small tasks from snowballing into overwhelming piles.

4. Know Your Peak Hours: Everyone has natural energy rhythms. I do my hardest work between 8-11 AM when my brain is sharpest. Schedule your most important tasks during your biological prime time, not just when it's convenient.

5. Single-Task Like Your Life Depends on It: Multitasking is a myth that makes you less productive, not more. Focus on one thing at a time, finish it, then move to the next. Your brain will thank you with better quality work.

6. Build Systems, Not Goals: Goals tell you what you want; systems tell you how to get there. Instead of ""write a book,"" create a system: ""write 300 words every morning before coffee."" Systems run on autopilot once established.

7. Protect Your Input: Be ruthless about what you consume. Limit news, social media, and negative content. Your mind processes everything you feed it, so choose high-quality inputs if you want high-quality outputs.

8. Weekly Reviews Are Non-Negotiable: Every Sunday, spend 20 minutes reviewing what worked, what didn't, and what needs adjustment. This prevents you from repeating mistakes and helps you course-correct quickly.

These aren't groundbreaking ideas, but applying them consistently has transformed how much I accomplish without burning out.

What simple rules keep you productive? I'd love to hear your approach.",1,1757896486.0,Discipline,0,1.0,False

I have been taking 20 mg Omeprazole every day since my endoscopy last December, which had revealed a moderate hiatal hernia. Omeprazole has made the reflux less painful, but it hasn't stopped frequent regurgitation and burping. That has only gotten worse since I got pregnant. 

I went to see my GI, who basically gave me the same diet recommendations from webMD that I already knew about and had mostly implemented. My symptoms have worsened since my visit.

I eat small meals and I don't eat 3 hours prior to bedtime. I experience reflux and bloating almost every day, and water has become a clear trigger.

I‚Äôve been ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with this guy for a while, he came into the restaurant I work at like 6-8 months ago with some friends and had asked for my instagram. Our friendship has mostly just been him coming in to my work to talk, and we have grabbed food/coffee a few times after my shift.

About 3 weeks ago he asked me out on an actual date. I told him I wished I could but I can‚Äôt.. I also have tried to set him up with another girl I work with who is a lot like me/same age but he wasn‚Äôt going for it.

He came to my work with my favourite drink the other day and brought me flowers. He wants to know why exactly I can‚Äôt, obviously I can‚Äôt tell him.

Now I‚Äôm stressed because up until then I knew nobody would care. I wasn‚Äôt hurting anyone.

But i literally cannot back out, I‚Äôm in a bad situation and have no other way out.

I should have made up a better excuse and told him I was seeing someone or something but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it.

Usually when I reject guys, I just say I can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm doing ‚Äúbad‚Äù.. no one‚Äôs ever questioned it so I didn‚Äôt think to say something else. They are normally strangers though

It also sucks because if I just told him the truth about my situation there‚Äôs no chance in hell he would ever date me but I‚Äôm too much of a coward to tell anyone. It‚Äôs embarrassing.. but it would save him a lot of hurt

Once you see these patterns, you can't unsee them.

1. People say yes to those they like.¬†Seems obvious, but watch how salespeople mirror your body language, find common ground, or give genuine compliments before asking for anything. Works every single time.
2. We feel obligated to return favors.¬†Someone gives you something small and free? You suddenly feel like you owe them. This is why car dealerships offer free coffee and real estate agents bring cookies to open houses.
3. Social proof runs everything.¬†""Most popular item,"" ""4.8 stars,"" ""other customers also bought"" - we look to others to decide what's normal or right. Even fake reviews work because our brains default to following the crowd.
4. Authority makes us compliance machines.¬†Put someone in a uniform, give them a title, or mention their credentials and people will follow almost any instruction. It's scary how much we shut off critical thinking around perceived experts.
5. Scarcity creates instant desire.¬†""Limited time offer,"" ""only 3 left in stock,"" ""exclusive access"" suddenly you want something you didn't care about 5 minutes ago. Our brains are wired to want what we might lose.
6. Commitment and consistency trap us.¬†Once you agree to something small, you'll do almost anything to stay consistent with that identity. This is how cults work, but also how gym memberships and political campaigns get you hooked.
7. Reciprocation works even when you don't want the initial favor.¬†Someone does something ""nice"" for you that you never asked for? You still feel obligated to return it. Manipulative people exploit this constantly.

Once I learned this stuff, I started noticing it everywhere. Marketing emails, political ads, even friends and family use these tactics (probably without realizing it).

You become basically immune to most manipulation once you recognize the patterns. Haven't fallen for a sales pitch in months.

Every single day of my life revolved around her. I washed her clothes, cooked her meals, made sure she never missed her medicines, and kept the house clean and orderly. At night, I stayed awake when pain tormented her, when she coughed or groaned. I held her hand when her strength was fading, whispering words that may not have meant much, but I believed they brought her some comfort



And Markus‚Ä¶ my brother Markus only showed up when it suited him. Short visits, sometimes a bouquet of flowers, sometimes a box of chocolates. He always said, ‚ÄúLet me know if anything happens,‚Äù but that was the extent of his involvement. He wasn‚Äôt there for the sleepless nights, nor to stroke her hair when her pain grew unbearable. He wasn‚Äôt there when our mother looked at me with fear and agony in her eyes, and I could not look away.



And then, one day, she was gone. Quietly, without pain, without long goodbyes. The world I knew collapsed. I hadn‚Äôt even begun to process the loss, hadn‚Äôt truly started grieving, when Markus called for a ‚Äúfamily meeting.‚Äù I went, thinking we would discuss the funeral, arrangements, memories.



But it wasn‚Äôt a meeting. It was a verdict.



‚ÄúThe house is mine now,‚Äù he said coldly, dropping a pile of papers on the table. ‚ÄúMother left it in my name.‚Äù



I froze.



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I managed to whisper, unable to believe my ears.



He sighed, as though he were explaining something to a child.



‚ÄúShe changed her will last year. She probably thought I could handle things better.‚Äù



Handle things better? How dare he say that, when I had spent every moment of my life in that house, when every corner held my tears, my sleepless nights, my devotion?



‚ÄúYou were hardly ever here,‚Äù I muttered, barely containing my trembling.



He shrugged.



‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ it was her decision.‚Äù



It felt as though the ground slipped from under me. I had no savings ‚Äî my life had been entirely devoted to caring for her. And now, a few strokes of a pen, and my own brother was throwing me out onto the street.



A week later, I stood at the doorstep with a suitcase at my feet, while Markus changed the locks. His deliberate calmness, that smug little smile, the arrogant look in his eyes pierced through me like ice. He turned, cast me a final glance, and slammed the door.



But then I noticed it. A small detail ‚Äî almost invisible. One of the bricks in the steps was loose. Our mother often hid things there ‚Äî coins, letters, photographs, little treasures. Something clicked inside me.



I smiled.



Because I felt it: Markus had forgotten something. Something important.



Back at my rented flat, I sat on the sofa, clutching our mother‚Äôs old blanket. Its scent ‚Äî lavender and baby powder ‚Äî instantly carried me back to childhood. I remembered her waiting at the door with a smile, even after a long, exhausting day at work. Her hands, her laughter, her voice ‚Äî the memories came in waves. I wept quietly, letting the grief wash over me, but beneath the tears, a sense of determination was growing.



The next morning, I returned to the steps. Sure enough, the brick was loose. I carefully pulled it out and found a small metal box inside. Letters, photographs, diaries. But also ‚Äî a key. A small, delicate key, crafted with intricate designs, as though from another era.



At first, I couldn‚Äôt imagine what it was for. But my heart told me this was what Mother had meant for me, not Markus. She knew he wouldn‚Äôt appreciate it. She left it for me, and me alone.



I remembered how she once whispered about a hidden compartment under the stairs, a secret she used long ago to hide valuables. As a child, I thought it was just a story, a game. Now, I understood: it had been a lesson, a preparation.



I searched the house, carefully inspecting every corner, every wall. And then I found it ‚Äî a small safe, hidden behind the wall in the living room. The key fit perfectly.



Inside, I discovered documents: shares, bank accounts, letters, and another will ‚Äî an earlier one, written before Markus manipulated her into changing everything. In her handwriting, in her words, she made it clear: the house and her most precious belongings were entrusted to me.



I read her letters. She wrote about love, about pride in my sacrifices, about how much she valued me. One line struck me like lightning: ‚ÄúMy dear daughter, if Markus ever tries to deny your rights, remember that I am with you always. This house, this memory ‚Äî they are your strength.‚Äù



Tears ran down my face, but grief gave way to resolve. I knew then: I had proof, I had rights, I had her blessing. Markus would not cast me aside so easily.



The following weeks tested me. Meetings with lawyers, preparing documents, gathering evidence. Every night, I thought of her ‚Äî her wisdom, her gentle smile, her strength ‚Äî and I knew I wasn‚Äôt fighting for money. I was fighting for her memory, for our bond.



When I finally faced Markus in a lawyer‚Äôs office, his arrogance began to crumble. My calmness unnerved him. I laid out the papers, the letters, the will. He tried to argue, threaten, accuse ‚Äî but each document silenced him. Piece by piece, his confidence dissolved into anger, then confusion.



At last, he understood he had lost. His smug grin was gone. I, on the other hand, felt relief. Not triumph ‚Äî just relief. The house was mine again.



I returned home and walked through the rooms. Every wall, every shelf, every doorway whispered her presence. I placed her belongings with care, preserving her touch, her warmth. The house was no longer just bricks and mortar ‚Äî it was a monument to her life, to our love.



Sometimes I sat on the stairs, holding the box of letters, rereading them. She had left me not just material possessions, but something far greater ‚Äî her trust, her love, her faith in me.



Markus disappeared. He never came back. Whenever I heard his name, I recalled the smirk with which he shut me out. And I smiled. Because I knew: he had overlooked the most precious thing. And it was mine.



The house came alive again. Quiet, peaceful, filled with the scents and sounds I cherished. I learned to treasure every detail. And I knew I would never again let anyone strip away what truly mattered.



Inside me grew a strength I never knew I had. A strength given by my mother ‚Äî born of her love and her faith. Every day, I felt her with me. Not as a shadow, not only as a memory, but in every corner, every room, every heartbeat of the home that was now my present and my future.



Over time, I rebuilt my life there. I tended the garden she loved, cooked her recipes, polished the old furniture. I read her diaries, where she poured out her dreams, fears, and wisdom. She had lived for love and family, and she had left me that legacy.



The house was no longer empty. It breathed again. It pulsed with her spirit, with my care, with life.



And I knew: my true inheritance was not wealth, not property, but the strength to live with love, honesty, and dignity. That was what no one could ever take away.



The first spring in the house without Mother was both the hardest and the most beautiful of my life. I spent mornings in the garden she had once tended with such devotion. Her roses, though neglected during her illness, were still alive. I pruned them, watered them, spoke to them the way she used to. Slowly, they blossomed again. When the first bud opened, I stood there for a long time, tears in my eyes. It felt like she had sent me a message: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing well. Keep going.‚Äù



Neighbours noticed the change too. Frau Schneider from across the street often came by with fresh bread and stories about my mother. She would sit with me in the kitchen, sipping tea, reminiscing about the laughter they once shared. Her words warmed me, reminding me that my mother‚Äôs kindness had touched more lives than I realised.



One afternoon, while sorting through boxes in the attic, I stumbled upon something unexpected ‚Äî a small leather-bound notebook with the initials A.K. embossed on the cover. At first, I thought it belonged to Markus, but as I opened it, I realised it was a journal my mother had kept in her youth, long before either of us were born.



The pages revealed a woman I had never truly known ‚Äî full of dreams, ambition, even rebellion. She wrote about wanting to travel through Italy, to study art in Florence, to see the cathedrals of Spain. Yet life had anchored her here, in our small German town, raising two children, working tirelessly, sacrificing dreams for stability.



I read one line over and over again: ‚ÄúPerhaps one day my children will go where I could not. Perhaps my daughter will carry my dreams further than I ever could.‚Äù



That night, I sat by the window with the notebook in my lap, gazing at the stars. For the first time in months, I thought not only of the past but of the future. Perhaps it was time to live, not just to guard what remained. Perhaps Mother wanted me to continue her story, not just preserve it.



And so, with trembling hands, I began planning my first journey. I would go to Florence, where she had always longed to go. I imagined standing in front of Botticelli‚Äôs paintings, walking the cobbled streets, sending her spirit the message: ‚ÄúWe made it, Mama. We‚Äôre here.‚Äù



But just as I felt hope rising in me, Markus returned. Not in person ‚Äî but in the form of another lawyer‚Äôs letter. He claimed he still had a right to ‚Äúpart of the estate‚Äù and threatened a new legal battle. My hands shook as I read the words, anger flooding back.



I knew he didn‚Äôt want the house for love. He wanted it for money, for pride, to prove he could win. I sat at the kitchen table all night, Mother‚Äôs letters spread before me. Her words, her handwriting, her faith in me ‚Äî they anchored me once more.



The next morning, I made a decision. I would fight him again, but this time not just with lawyers. I would confront Markus face-to-face.



When we finally met at a caf√© in town, he looked tired, thinner than before. His arrogance had dulled, but his bitterness remained.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wasting your life in that house,‚Äù he sneered. ‚ÄúSell it, divide the money, move on. That‚Äôs what she would have wanted.‚Äù



I looked at him steadily. ‚ÄúNo, Markus. That‚Äôs what you want. She wanted love, family, roots. She trusted me with that, because you never cared. And you know it.‚Äù



For a moment, I saw something flicker in his eyes ‚Äî guilt, perhaps, or shame. But it quickly hardened. He muttered something under his breath and left.



I didn‚Äôt chase him. I didn‚Äôt need to.



That evening, I lit a candle in the living room, placed it beside Mother‚Äôs photograph, and whispered aloud: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll protect this home. But I‚Äôll also live. For you, and for me.‚Äù



The house glowed softly in the candlelight, as though it agreed.



And deep inside, I knew this was only the beginning. The house was my anchor, but the world was calling. And somehow, I felt certain that wherever I went, she would follow ‚Äî in the letters, in the roses, in the quiet strength she had planted in me.



The next weeks unfolded with a strange mixture of calm and anticipation. Each day in the house felt like a dialogue with my mother ‚Äî in the way the morning light spilled through the lace curtains she had sewn, in the creak of the old wooden floor, in the smell of freshly brewed coffee that reminded me of childhood breakfasts.



But at night, when the house grew quiet, I often opened her youthful journal again. The words Florence, Seville, Paris seemed to whisper from the pages, urging me not only to preserve her memory but to carry it forward.



So I began preparing. I set aside savings, organised the paperwork for the house, and secured everything legally so Markus would have no chance of interfering again. My lawyer reassured me: ‚ÄúThe documents are clear. He can no longer challenge you. The house is yours by right.‚Äù



For the first time in months, I felt safe. Free.



It was in early summer when I finally boarded a train bound for Italy. I chose the train deliberately ‚Äî slow, steady, like a pilgrimage. With me I carried only one suitcase, my mother‚Äôs blanket, and the little box of letters I had found behind the brick.



When the train rolled into Florence, I felt as though my mother were beside me. The city unfolded like a dream ‚Äî terracotta rooftops, narrow cobblestone alleys, the golden dome of the Duomo rising above everything. I walked through the streets, touching the old stone walls, breathing in the scent of espresso and freshly baked bread, imagining her wide-eyed wonder if she had stood here.



At the Uffizi Gallery, I found myself standing in front of Botticelli‚Äôs Primavera. Tears welled in my eyes. I whispered, barely audibly:



‚ÄúMama, we made it. This is for you.‚Äù



I stayed in Florence for a week, exploring churches, markets, little family-owned trattorias. At night, I sat by the Arno River, writing in a notebook of my own. Not just travel notes, but letters to my mother ‚Äî continuing the dialogue she had started in her journals.



It was there, in a small caf√© near Piazza Santo Spirito, that I met Elena. She was a middle-aged Italian woman with kind eyes, sketching in a notebook. We struck up a conversation, first about art, then about life. When I told her why I had come, she placed her hand gently over mine.



‚ÄúYour mother is proud of you,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúYou are carrying her unfinished journey. That is the most beautiful gift a daughter can give.‚Äù



Her words stayed with me.



After Florence came Seville. Then Paris. In every city, I sought out the places my mother had once described in her diary ‚Äî cathedrals, gardens, museums. I began to feel as though I wasn‚Äôt just traveling for her, but also discovering myself.



One evening, in Paris, sitting by the Seine, I reread one of Mother‚Äôs old letters. In it, she wrote: ‚ÄúTrue strength is not only in holding on, but also in moving forward. One day, I hope you will find that strength.‚Äù



For the first time, I understood fully. Caring for her, fighting Markus, preserving the house ‚Äî all of it had been about holding on. But now, traveling, breathing, living ‚Äî this was moving forward.



Months passed. And yet, every time I returned to the house in our German town, I felt peace. The roses bloomed brighter, the rooms felt warmer, and the shadows of grief lifted little by little.



Markus never came back. Perhaps he was ashamed, perhaps simply uninterested. I no longer wondered. He belonged to a part of the past I had already made peace with.



One winter evening, as snow fell gently outside, I lit the fire in the living room and opened my own notebook. It was already half full of letters ‚Äî to Mother, to myself, to the future



I realised something then: I was building my own legacy. Just as she had left me hers in letters, diaries, and hidden treasures, I was creating mine ‚Äî words that one day might guide someone I love.



The house was no longer only my mother‚Äôs memory. It was alive again, carrying two generations of stories ‚Äî hers and mine.\\



And for the first time in my life, I no longer felt bound by the past or afraid of the future.



I was free.



Spring returned, and with it, the garden outside the house burst into colour. The roses, once wilted, now stood tall and proud, their petals catching the sunlight. I often worked in the soil with my bare hands, as Mother once did, feeling grounded, connected to her and to life itself.



But something inside me had shifted. Traveling through Florence, Seville, Paris ‚Äî fulfilling her dreams ‚Äî had awakened something I hadn‚Äôt expected: a longing not just to preserve, not just to honour, but to live.



The house was no longer a shrine. It was a home.



One afternoon, as I was repairing the old wooden fence by the garden, a neighbour stopped by. Lukas, a teacher from the local school, had recently moved back to town after years away. He offered to help, and together we replaced the broken boards, laughing at our clumsy teamwork.

I've been obsessed with making the perfect cup of hot chocolate lately, and I wanted to share my experience and insights about choosing the right hot chocolate maker. After trying various machines and doing tons of research, I've learned quite a bit about what makes a great hot chocolate maker.

First off, let's talk about capacity. If you're like me and love hosting friends for movie nights, you'll want a machine that can make multiple servings at once. I recently found this awesome hot chocolate maker (https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker) that's perfect for families or small gatherings.

Temperature control is super important. You want a machine that can heat milk to the perfect temperature - not too hot that it burns the chocolate, but hot enough to melt it completely. The best ones have adjustable temperature settings, which is great for different types of chocolate and milk alternatives.

Speaking of milk, look for a machine with a good frothing system. The frother makes your hot chocolate creamy and gives it that cafe-style texture. Some machines even have different froth settings for various drinks.

Another thing I've learned is that cleaning matters a lot. Trust me, dried chocolate can be a pain to clean! The best hot chocolate makers have removable parts that are dishwasher safe. This has been a game-changer for me.

Size and counter space are worth considering too. While browsing options, I found this great selection (https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker) with different sizes to fit any kitchen setup.

Auto shut-off is a must-have safety feature. Sometimes I get distracted watching YouTube videos, and it's reassuring to know the machine will turn off by itself.

Look for machines with different mixing speeds. This helps break down chocolate chunks better and ensures smooth blending. Some even come with special mixing paddles designed specifically for hot chocolate.

Material quality is crucial too. Stainless steel machines tend to last longer and look better than plastic ones. Plus, they're usually easier to clean and don't retain odors.

Power consumption might seem minor, but it affects how quickly your drink is ready. Higher wattage usually means faster heating, but check if it matches your home's electrical setup.

Lastly, consider if you want extra features like programmable settings or the ability to make other drinks. Some machines can handle coffee, tea, or even cold drinks, which is pretty cool for summer.

Remember, the perfect hot chocolate maker depends on your specific needs. Think about how often you'll use it and what features matter most to you. Happy hot chocolate making!",1,1757895457.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nh7387,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_wajid123_/comments/1nh7387/best_coffee_makers_commonly_chosen_by_most_people/,Best Coffee Makers Commonly Chosen by Most People,"So recently I was trying to figure out *which coffee makers people actually buy the most these days*. I came across a ton of Reddit discussions and product reviews, but honestly, it gets overwhelming because everyone recommends something different.

To save time for anyone in the same boat, I did some research and built a list of the most commonly chosen coffee makers in 2025. These are machines that kept popping up again and again in reviews, conversations, and real user recommendations.

**~~Here‚Äôs the list I came up with:~~**

# [1. OXO Brew 8-Cup Coffee Maker ‚Äì Single-Serve & Carafe](https://reviewriches.com/best-coffee-makers-commonly-chosen-by-most-people-today/#11)

A lot of people recommend the OXO Brew because it‚Äôs **SCA Certified**, which means it makes consistently good coffee at the right temperature. It‚Äôs flexible too‚Äîyou can brew a single cup or a full 8-cup carafe. The thermal stainless-steel carafe keeps coffee hot for hours without ruining the flavor. Super simple design, durable build, and reliable for daily use.

**Reasons to buy:** SCA certified, brews single cup & full carafe, thermal carafe keeps coffee hot.  
**Reasons to avoid:** No built-in grinder, fewer customization features.

# [2. Ninja Specialty Coffee Maker CM401 ‚Äì 10-Cup Carafe](https://reviewriches.com/best-coffee-makers-commonly-chosen-by-most-people-today/#2)

This one shows up everywhere in conversations. The Ninja Specialty is popular because it‚Äôs versatile you can brew regular drip coffee, iced coffee, or even make concentrated coffee for lattes and cappuccinos. The built-in frother is a big plus for people who like caf√©-style drinks at home. With a 10-cup carafe, it‚Äôs perfect for families.

**Reasons to buy:** Multiple brewing styles, built-in frother, 10-cup capacity.  
**Reasons to avoid:** Glass carafe doesn‚Äôt hold heat as well, takes more counter space.

# [3. Breville Bambino Plus Espresso Machine ‚Äì Brushed Stainless Steel](https://reviewriches.com/best-coffee-makers-commonly-chosen-by-most-people-today/#3)

If you‚Äôre into espresso, this is one of the most recommended machines. It heats up in just 3 seconds, makes caf√©-quality espresso with rich crema, and has an automatic steam wand for milk frothing. Small but powerful, it‚Äôs a favorite for anyone serious about their coffee game.

**Reasons to buy:** Fast heat-up, professional espresso, automatic milk frothing.  
**Reasons to avoid:** Pricier than drip machines, smaller water tank.

# [4. Braun BrewSense 12-Cup Drip Coffee Maker ‚Äì Stainless Steel](https://reviewriches.com/best-coffee-makers-commonly-chosen-by-most-people-today/#4)

For people who just want a reliable drip coffee maker, the Braun BrewSense is super popular. It‚Äôs big enough for families with its 12-cup carafe, and you can program it 24 hours ahead so you wake up to fresh coffee. The pause-and-pour feature is convenient, and it even has a self-cleaning mode.

**Reasons to buy:** Large capacity, programmable timer, auto shutoff, easy to use.  
**Reasons to avoid:** Bulky design, no specialty coffee features.

# [5. Nespresso Essenza Mini by DeLonghi ‚Äì Black](https://reviewriches.com/best-coffee-makers-commonly-chosen-by-most-people-today/#5)

If you‚Äôre short on time, this one comes up in almost every discussion. The Essenza Mini is compact, heats up in 25 seconds, and makes espresso or lungo with one button. It‚Äôs perfect for apartments or offices since it doesn‚Äôt take up space. A lot of people like it because it‚Äôs low-maintenance and affordable compared to bigger machines.

**Reasons to buy:** Compact size, fast brewing, simple operation, budget-friendly.  
**Reasons to avoid:** Limited to Nespresso pods, small water tank.

# [6. Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV Select ‚Äì 10-Cup Coffee Maker](https://reviewriches.com/best-coffee-makers-commonly-chosen-by-most-people-today/#6)

This is a bit of a premium option, but coffee purists swear by it. Handmade in the Netherlands, it‚Äôs built like a tank and designed to last decades. It brews 10 cups in about 6 minutes while keeping the water at the ideal temperature. If you want top-tier drip coffee and don‚Äôt mind the higher price, this is a top pick.

**Reasons to buy:** Exceptional build quality, fast brewing, consistent taste.  
**Reasons to avoid:** Expensive, no extra features like frothing.

**Final Thoughts**

After going through reviews and discussions, it‚Äôs clear that there isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúone best coffee maker‚Äù ‚Äî it depends on what you want.

* If you want **versatility**, go for the Ninja Specialty CM401.
* If you care about **everyday reliability**, the OXO Brew or Braun BrewSense are great.
* For **espresso**, Breville Bambino Plus and Nespresso Essenza Mini are super popular.
* And if you want **premium craftsmanship**, nothing beats the Technivorm Moccamaster.

So these are the coffee makers most people seem to be buying in 2025. Hopefully this saves you some scrolling time.",1,1757894801.0,u_wajid123_,0,1.0,False

College grad, fluent in English, Sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits (because nothing says ‚Äúthrilling drama‚Äù like corporate loopholes) and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who‚Äôs the real master chef.

I don‚Äôt drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine‚Äîthen yes, I‚Äôm basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less ‚Äúclubbing till 2am‚Äù and more ‚Äúbuilding a pillow fort empire and bingeing Netflix until the cliffhanger leaves me emotionally bankrupt.‚Äù Basically, I‚Äôm a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

Also worth mentioning: I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that‚Äôs a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You‚Äôre in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use ‚Äúthere,‚Äù ‚Äútheir,‚Äù and ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that‚Äôs more than just ‚Äúhey‚Äù (plot twist: you‚Äôre actually interesting). You‚Äôre the type to send random memes that perfectly capture the chaos of life, because sometimes a well-timed GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don‚Äôt smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix: available on-demand, not in real life. If you‚Äôre thoughtful, communicative, and the type who remembers the small things (like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog), we‚Äôll get along just fine.

Sarcasm, laughter, and physical affection go a long way with me.

I‚Äôm not into games or drama, just hoping to connect with someone who‚Äôs kind, fun, and knows what she wants. Whether it stays as a solid friendship or grows into something more, I‚Äôm open to seeing where things go.

So, almost a month ago, I (37M) made a hinge profile and matched with a guy (36M). We've been talking for a while, and decided to meet for a coffee, which went fine.
I accompanied him to catch his train, I live next to the station, and before I left the station I received a message from him saying he enjoyed meeting me, bla blah, and I thought it was nice.

Fast forward to today (or yesterday, it's 2 am where I am), we met again for a coffee, and when i left the station, I received another message from him where he said he loved seeing me again and enjoyed his time. I did too.

Here's the ""problem"", whilst after our first date I felt kinda of indifferent but interested where this would go, today I left with a mixed feeling of happiness and anxiety, and a weird sensation in my chest.
Five hours later, I'm unable to sleep because those feelings are not leaving me, and I'm kinda anxious.

I know what those feelings are, but isn't it too soon to fall for someone? This quick?
It doesn't help that we have many interests in common, and almost want the same things.

1nh6ya7,https://v.redd.it/6bpyopfly7pf1,"Ode grinder, ruined?","Hi community, think I may have f'd my ode grinder (Gen 1).
I ground some coffee on Saturday, 40g from a French press. It was fine, then on Sunday I had a brain fart, went to grind the same for another french press but weighed out 80g instead of 40g. The grinder got stuck after grinding roughly half, slightly more. I stupidly tried to restart it numerous times to see if I could clear the issue and put it on the largest grind setting, but it kept failing. 
So this evening, after watching the fellow Burt cleaning video, I unscrewed the dial plate, but managed to undo the small.screws, then unscrewed the central screw (thinking it was different at the Gen 1 and their video was Gen 2), undid the rest to get out the burr.  I cleaned it all out (there were quite a few beans in there) then put it back together.
The little grind size clicker fell out, but I found it and the spring and managed to get that bit out back together.
(It also marked the dial because the screwdriver brushed it and I have the white one).
I thought I'd run a few beans through, it seemed to grind them but its power delivery is not smooth and I feel the motor might be f'd. Also not really sure if the grind size adjustment is working, but I can test that another day grinding some beans. Attached a video of its post cleaning power on.

1nh6y0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1nh6y0r/how_tiny_acts_of_courage_helped_me_stop_feeling/,How tiny acts of courage helped me stop feeling invisible.,"A couple of months ago, I was at one of the lowest points in my life. My ex had just left me, I‚Äôd been fired from my job, and the only work I could find after was low-paying and draining. On top of that, the anxiety I‚Äôd carried for years was at its peak. I couldn‚Äôt even order a coffee without my chest tightening and my mind screaming to run.

Socially, I felt invisible. In meetings, I‚Äôd stay quiet. Around friends, I laughed less and mostly stayed on the edges. Deep down, I wanted to be seen, but it felt impossible.

At some point, I realized no one was going to fix it for me. I had to do something, even if it was tiny. So I started small like really small:

* Saying ‚Äúhi‚Äù to a barista.
* Sitting up straight when I wanted to fold in on myself.
* Writing down one small win every night (even if it was just ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt cancel plans‚Äù).

It sounds ridiculous, but those micro-actions added up. I stopped avoiding eye contact. I stopped apologizing for existing. People started to notice me more, and my confidence didn‚Äôt feel like an act anymore.

I ended up stumbling across this little 30-day experiment that someone had turned into a book. At first I thought it sounded too simple, but I gave it a shot. It‚Äôs all about practicing ‚Äúmicro-courage‚Äù every day until it starts to rewire how you see yourself.

I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm ‚Äúfixed‚Äù fear still shows up, heartbreak still stings, and the job situation isn‚Äôt glamorous but I don‚Äôt feel invisible anymore. I finally feel like I‚Äôm living instead of hiding.

If you‚Äôre in that dark place right now, please know: you don‚Äôt have to do something huge to change. One small act of courage today can be the start.

For me, it was saying hi to the barista when I wanted to stay quiet. What‚Äôs the smallest act of courage you‚Äôve done that actually made a big impact?",6,1757894406.0,getdisciplined,2,1.0,False

Was I unreasonable?","She (26F) invited me (25M) clubbing with her friends which I don‚Äôt really like to do but I liked being around her and knew she liked to dance. We‚Äôve done so many other things and she seemed levelheaded, but the other night changed the way I saw it. 
I left for one minute to use the restroom and she was okay with a guy dancing on her from behind when I came back and she didn‚Äôt tell him to go away. It really upset me because she knew I was there and I know she went without me a number of times in the past. If she thinks that‚Äôs okay when I‚Äôm there I don‚Äôt know what she does when I‚Äôm not and I‚Äôve been with her to concerts in the past and I thought she just liked to dance. But I tried to notion her to stop and she leaned into him more
She was just drunk I thought, but this was a few days ago and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about if that‚Äôs what she likes to go out and do I can‚Äôt accept it. I don‚Äôt know if it was just a bad night for her, but she acted like I was crazy when I tried to tell the guy she was okay. She‚Äôs told me a number of times she doesn‚Äôt think cheating is wrong if it‚Äôs a threesome or if you both do it sometimes. 
I can‚Äôt care about her the way I did because it hurts too much to think that I‚Äôm not enough for her. I didn‚Äôt want to be controlling because I thought she just liked to dance but everything I see online just says I‚Äôm insecure, am I really the asshole for not wanting to date someone that thinks it‚Äôs okay to let someone else grind on their partner? I kept waiting for her to ask him to stop before I tried to see if she needed help but I think she wanted that more than me and I hate myself for being so stupid. 
The next day she told me she didn‚Äôt think she did anything wrong but she didn‚Äôt even remember what happened. We were dating for two years, I tried to understand her side of the story, I listened to her, I went to those types of things with her whenever her friends didn‚Äôt want to go, I danced even though I don‚Äôt like to, I bought her flowers and made her dinner, I went to festivals and only listened to the bands she liked, I miss her but I never want to see her again. 
I don‚Äôt want a church girl, but I think there‚Äôs nothing in between anymore; why did men being shitty mean we all have to be shitty. I wasted like 10% of my life on her, and now I can‚Äôt think about what I could have done different. Why do I feel like I failed myself, am I the one to blame? I just wanted her to stop but if she‚Äôs doing this regularly am I the idiot? She‚Äôs been going to raves with friends for so long while we were dating she‚Äôs definitely done more than this. If this was a bad night for her, what does a very bad night look like? Does he wake up on her bed, with the stuffed animal I got her for Christmas? I‚Äôm so stupid I hate myself or is this just what dating is now, does it get better. 
I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep for two days, the first night I was thinking about what happened, then I went for coffee with her to break the news, and tonight I kept reading her texts about how I was a dick for not letting her enjoy her 20‚Äôs but I was trying to be understanding I like music too but I don‚Äôt get drunk and grope or get groped by other people (at least not consentually). Especially not if she was there..

I‚Äôm sorry for the rant, I just want to hear what people think because everything I see on Reddit says I‚Äôm the asshole for not letting her have fun (at least from similar posts I‚Äôve seen). She seems to think the same because she said she‚Äôs never taken anyone home but if I was doing the same things regularly with other women or if a gay guy was grinding on me and I didn‚Äôt stop either of those things I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd have felt the same way if the roles were reversed. Why don‚Äôt people want to have fun and eventually grow up a little bit, what happened to being young and dumb then growing up? I feel like an idiot for trusting her to have reasonable boundaries. I hate myself because everything that people online say regarding things like this are you‚Äôre either far right or all hope is lost in dating or you were trying to be controlling. When did expecting your partner not to sexualize other people in front of you become any of these things. I loved her so much and I hate my life; why is everyone so okay with these things when did we stop wanting to seriously date when did all people care about become raving and casual sex forever.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

Been discovering I‚Äôm (31M) HL over the last year and it‚Äôs never been an issue before because everyone I‚Äôve dated has been extremely high libido and kind of matched my freak. 

I‚Äôm married now to an incredible person (28F) who has always professed to be low libido, but has recently been ill for the last year and some change, which has furthered their low drive to being nearly non-existent. Now we don‚Äôt even have conversations that are remotely sexual, and if I try to flirt over text I‚Äôm just ignored. I used to love taking naughty selfies and pics for my partner and now when I take them I feel sad/resentful that it‚Äôs hardly appreciated, I even stopped sending them at all, I just leave them on my phone and look at it imagining how it would feel to be desired.

It was our 1 year wedding anniversary recently and I came back from a work trip overnight to be there on time‚Ä¶she kept asking what time I‚Äôd be home and I thought things were going to lead to an exciting romantic night but I came home only find them in bed, just watching shows & not even showered or changed. I tried to make it sexy after I got cleaned up, and we ended up having sex but it felt like so‚Ä¶one sided? I don‚Äôt know. I gave her the small gift I got her, got nothing in return, and am just focused on preparing for work to distract myself. 

I‚Äôm extremely loyal, which has made things really tough at times as I feel so guilty for finding myself turned on every day and with the wildest thoughts. It‚Äôs harder because I genuinely try not to flirt with anyone, or even emotionally look for validation, but I guess I‚Äôm giving off a flirtatious energy because I‚Äôve been getting asked out whenever I‚Äôm sitting alone having a coffee at a park or hanging out with friends ‚Äî I never reciprocate and immediately explain I have a wife and appreciate the compliment‚Ä¶but the way I‚Äôm left just feeling so empty and turned on is making me feel so sad and angry when I‚Äôm home.

I hate feeling this way, I hate feeling resentful when I truly love her and it‚Äôs just sex. I hate that I keep imagining what it was like with my exes when that‚Äôs so unfair to her, or that my friends reach out for advice on how to spice up their lives because I‚Äôm the known freak knowing what my private life is like.

1nh6ljv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSDpartners/comments/1nh6ljv/a_postbreakup_reflection_of_my_relationship_with/,A post-breakup reflection of my relationship with a CPTSD partner,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my story of what dating my ex with CPTSD was like. I think writing it out here will help me process, and maybe it will resonate with some of you. It‚Äôs very detailed because I‚Äôve read through almost every Reddit post on this and similar sub-Reddits, and the stories with the full details were the ones that have helped me the most. So the more details, hopefully the more ways I will connect with your stories. 

The Good of the Relationship 
I was with my partner for about 2 years, and I deeply loved them and still love them. It was the most intense romantic relationship of my life, to the point of addicting for me. 
- When we met it was immediate and intense attraction, and we both wanted monogamy but lots of sex, children, good mental and physical health and growth, and adventure. 
- They were so playful, sexual, affectionate, adventurous, kind hearted, spontaneous, and bring me so much joy. 
- We had a lot of sex (but I struggled to keep up due to body issues that I am still resolving, and this caused them a lot of frustration and invalidation) 
- We traveled so well together, explored a few international countries. 
- My friends and family adored them. 
- We cuddled a lot, shared movies and music and singing. 
- We always found ways to connect even when our lives felt like complete chaos. 

The End of the Relationship
But alongside all the good, they carried deep wounds from their past trauma, and I found myself constantly navigating the impact of their traumas influence on our relationship. Just after our recent breakup, they began intensive therapy to supplement their weekly therapy. 

HOW I HURT THEM
I‚Äôll start with what I did that hurt them and triggered them, as I don‚Äôt want to discount what I did - and this sets the stage for the rain of hurt they returned.  I want to be clear in stating that although they knew their traumas well, we didn‚Äôt know they had CPTSD until we were breaking up, so our relationship was lacking the knowledge and resources that I now have and wish I could‚Äôve utilized to benefit them, myself, and the relationship. I would like to believe I would‚Äôve been better able to adapt toe their responses to avoid so many triggering topics and situations had I known they had CPTSD and we had learned together about it.
- EARLY CONVO ON LYING AND MORALS - we had a philosophical discussion about lying and morality on an early weekend trip, where I took a position that lying is fundamentally bad but that everybody lies at some point. What matters most is why you lie and how you repair after a lie. But I work every day to not lie. This unfortunately triggered them deeply but they did not show or say this for a while. We also discussed morality and why humans can be good to each other; as an atheist I said morality is embedded in altruistic tendencies we teach each other and our children natively, but they believed that is flawed and that they weren‚Äôt sure how people could be moral without god.  
- FLIRTING - I lightly but friendly flirted with a few friends or acquaintances in front of my partner in different situations, saying the other person looked good at the gym or their clothes fit well. I also have friends who hug for a long time and kiss on the lips for hello or goodbye. We live in a very queer, open love area and our friends and community members are very flirtatious and that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve lived for a while. I had zero intention of cheating and was not attracted to these people, but my partner said they were very hurt by my actions. I apologized, repaired, and changed behavior, and they even acknowledged over time that they saw my intentional changes. 
- MORBID HUMOR: in times of duress or stress, I would make bleak humor jokes to lighten the mood because that‚Äôs how I was raised in my own family. My partner hated this and I had to modulate and eliminate the use of such humor with him, but I really struggled to do so. 
- CRUEL JOKE: there was one especially cruel joke I made once for which I can‚Äôt even remember the context, but the cruel joke i made was ‚Äúat least we know I‚Äôm the hot one‚Äù. I made it in haste and it came from the callous and inflammatory part of my brain tied to my days in the party boy scene. To this day I still regret saying this because it‚Äôs not how I feel, it‚Äôs not true, and it hurt my partner very deeply. To this day my ex partner has never truly forgiven me, I don‚Äôt think. 
- ‚ÄúFIXING‚Äù AND INVALIDATION: my partner noted I spent too much time trying to fix and solve problems instead of sitting with their feelings, which felt invalidating to them. I did try to sit with their feelings a lot, but I think I began to struggle when the need to sit with feelings happened so routinely that I began to burn out and I just wanted a solution implemented. 

WHAT THEY BELIEVED IN THEIR LIFE
When we broke up the first time about 6 months in, they told me several things that provided context for their trauma etc.
- They thought they‚Äôd be dead by 30.
- They thought all their partners were destined to lie and cheat and they just needed to find proof of it
- They thought they were destined for hell because they‚Äôre gay 
- They thought they were ugly, not lovable, etc. 

HOW THEY HURT ME

Hypervigilance and suspicion that I was cheating: After I triggered ~2 months into our relationship, they started to believe for the rest of the relationship that I was cheating and lying, even though I never did cheat. They later did cheat on me multiple times (all while not sober). They would accuse me constantly of cheating and lying - it felt like the smallest things would trigger suspicion and I was so on edge after a while that I would overly clean my house just to avoid any routine mess being a possible trigger for them.  No amount of reassurance seemed to stick, and it eventually became exhausting to live under that lens. What they saw as evidence of me cheating or what they did: 
- A stain on my coffee table or mirror 
- a mark on a pillow
- a long hair in the bathroom
- slightly off discharge colors during sex
- a late night text from a friend (‚Äúhey what‚Äôs up?‚Äù)
- condom counts changing in my drawer (we never used condoms, and I think I threw some really old ones away) 
- our favorite sex colored lighting being on when they got to my room (which was on from last night we had sex or just because I kept it that color)
- my Instagram followers changing
- a story I shared with them of me talking about sex generally with a friend
- Me using the words ‚ÄúI picked up a friend‚Äù when referring to the physical act of picking them up off the ground 
- Me not remembering all the details of a past sexual hookup with a now friend, or telling the history of my past boyfriends in parts that my partner would interpret as inconsistent or obscuring truths 
- Me not stating in advance I had hooked up with a friend in the past, even if that hookup was 10+ years in the past (we talked about this and I became much more intentional being direct and proactive about this) 
- 5 months into our relationship they found a dating app on my phone I never deleted, so I offered to show them the messages inside and all the latest messages were from before we became official in our relationship - but they assumed I was sneakily deleting all my messages and using the app behind their back. 
- They used my phone password to enter my phone and read my messages while I was asleep. I shared my password with them only so we can use each others phones when together, like when driving. Reading each others messages was a breach of trust. They also found no evidence of anything and admitted that the next day. 
- They asked if I had sex with almost every friend in my life, often with an air of suspicion or disbelief if I said no. 

Trust breakdowns: they repeatedly said to my face ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre lying‚Äù with accusations of me lying and covering up for it. 
- I would struggle to validate them sometimes, either because I‚Äôm flawed as a human or because I was emotionally worn out. In some of these times, I would say the wrong thing, make a joke to lighten the mood, or not fully take their side and then therefore I‚Äôd become the enemy and someone trying to tear them down. 
- They accused me and my friends of being Nazis
- They told their friends and family I was a bad partner and that I had done XYZ bad things and therefore was the bad partner and not trustworthy. 

Infidelity / Cheating on me
- They flirted with people on Instagram
- They sent / received nudes with people on a hookup app after ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù downloading the app for feeling hurt by their suspicions and thinking I was secretly using an app  
- On 4 different occasions while we were apart, they had sex with someone while drunk or otherwise not sober, typically at parties or a musical festival. 
- On 2 occasions they only made out with another person while apart. 
- The first time they cheated on me, they didn‚Äôt tell me for a few weeks and then told me to meet them outside in a pretty public park because they were afraid I‚Äôd hurt them in private (I have never physically hurt them, nor threatened to). Personally, this felt very unfair and confining because I couldn‚Äôt properly react emotionally in such a public space. 

Substance use: They coped by drinking heavily or using drugs with friends and strangers, often staying out until the sunrise or later. Their behavior frequently meant they would skip work, miss an event, or forget about a joint activity we had  the next day.  Personally, I have tried to avoid the nightlife / ‚Äúscene‚Äù to live a healthier life away from drugs, alcohol, and sleeplessness, but I felt OK at the beginning with them doing these things because they were so adamant with their ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI just love to dance‚Äù. But their repeated behaviors often left me worried, lonely, and disconnected. Sometimes, those nights also led to them cheating, which devastated me.
- On our first Valentine‚Äôs Day, we couldn‚Äôt meet up at mine or theirs because they were sick and we planned to watch a movie virtually. Before we started, they went AWOL for 40 mins to then call me, a bit drunk, stating they were ‚Äúon their way‚Äù and had got a hotel room nearby and ‚Äúwould love if I joined, but understood if I didn‚Äôt‚Äù. This was jarring and I really shouldn‚Äôt taken note. 
- Once, they missed a morning event we had scheduled by drinking and doing drugs until 6am, and their notification to me was a string of texts with just periods and no explanation. They didn‚Äôt show much remorse or guilt despite me going to this event all alone. 
- They‚Äôd use heavy drugs every weekend on repeat and state ‚ÄúI want to use less‚Äù but not try to extricate themselves from the situations where they knew they‚Äôd be inspired to use again. 
- On a few nights when they were incredibly intoxicated, they‚Äôd become very cruel to me, yell at me in a slurred voice that had all the air of inebriated righteousness, and say vicious things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre evil‚Äù and ‚Äúyou never cared for me‚Äù and ‚ÄúI hate you, fuck you, shut up‚Äù. Those nights really sting to this day. 

Avoidance and push‚Äìpull: They would oscillate between being very loving, sexual, intimate, and connected - and then suddenly would become distant or avoidant (such as in the middle of sex) and blaming me for things I hadn‚Äôt done. At times, they told me they didn‚Äôt even know who they were or what they wanted from life or relationships. They started the relationship being 100% on monogamy and wanting children, and later they stated that if they couldn‚Äôt didn‚Äôt have children due to whatever reason, they‚Äôd probably just party and fuck around and use drugs to find purpose. 
- They would get drunk at a dinner party then say ‚ÄúI want to go home alone‚Äù because ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt cuddle through the night and you don‚Äôt actually love me‚Äù. 
- The night of the 2024 election they got wasted and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving soon, you have 24 hours to decide if you‚Äôre coming too‚Äù and then called me a bitch, liar, and Nazi and said I just wanted to have kids because I couldn‚Äôt get with young sexy people anymore. 
- They wouldn‚Äôt tell new friends about me and our monogamous relationship because they thought the new friend wouldn‚Äôt want to be friends unless sex was a possibility 
- They were constantly buying nicotine vapes that we‚Äôd agree to throw away and then they‚Äôd buy it again immediately 
- They‚Äôd be avoidant or detached but after they‚Äôd do certain drugs they‚Äôd suddenly be very intimate and snuggly and lovey and apologize for all the hurt and pain they‚Äôve caused me because of their trust issues 

Therapy and Healing: At the start of the relationship (~1.5 months in), they laid out their past traumas from childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood and I listened intently and compassionately. I asked if they had processed them and they said yes - through therapy and EMDR, etc. They then asked me to be their partner and said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù. I excitedly agreed to the relationship but I also felt a bit ‚Äútrauma dumped‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt yet feel the ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù without it also feeling like a salve to the pains they brought on that day. I told them I‚Äôd need a bit more time to share that. I wonder if that hurt them that day. 

Upon our relationship ending, they entered an intensive therapy program to help pursue recovery and they have continued using alcohol and drugs and having a *lot* of sex with other people during it. The sudden shift to having so much sex with other people really hurts me because it feels demeaning for the reality and meaning of the relationship we had. 

Where I am Now
In this process I feel like I lost myself. I don‚Äôt know who I am without them in the aftermath of our breakup. Despite all the pain they caused me, I still miss them every day and it physically hurts to think about the times I had with them - good and bad. I feel ill reading all the cruelty I endured that I write above while I still sit here and wonder what they are up to and who they might be kissing or having sex with. I feel jealous of those other people, because I imagine they may be receiving an idealized version of my ex partner, like what I got early on that hooked me so hard. 

I tried so hard to support them in the ways I knew how - patience, forgiveness, physical connection, meeting my friends and family, support in their career and home life and finances - but the cycle of accusations, blame, reconnection, and avoidance repeated over and over again. I started feeling like no matter what I did, I would inevitably trigger them and that I was the bad person for failing the relationship.

Breaking up was heartbreaking. I still miss them deeply, and sometimes I blame myself, wondering if I could have done more - had more sex, said I love you more, been less defensive, encouraged pursuit of therapy earlier, listened more deeply, never made the mistakes that hurt them. I still wonder if we could be together again. I wish I could shake these thoughts and move on right now, but it‚Äôs a long process of letting go. All the good times flood my brain whenever I try to move on. 

But I also know I couldn‚Äôt have ‚Äúloved away‚Äù their trauma and that I have an idealized view of our relationship and what could‚Äôve been. They needed to do their own healing work outside of our relationship, and I needed peace and safety again to live my life without fear or pain. I‚Äôm grateful for where I am today, even if I am horribly sad and feeling lonely without him much of the time. 

A Call for Your Thoughts
I‚Äôm posting here because I know many of you have been through similar dynamics. I have questions for you all, if you are willing to share: 
1. How did you come to terms with the fact that love isn‚Äôt enough to ‚Äúfix‚Äù CPTSD in your partner? 
2. How do you work through the ‚ÄúWhat Ifs‚Äù of everything we could have done better to potentially make the relationship work?
3. How did you start to heal yourself after a breakup?
4. How do you stop wanting to reach out to them (or stop actually reaching out)?

Thanks for reading and for your thoughts. Much love to this community. I wish I could hug you all for the support you‚Äôve given me with all your thoughts. ",1,1757893447.0,CPTSDpartners,0,1.0,False

1nh6iqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1nh6iqq/ive_had_this_dream_every_night_this_week_no/,"I've had this dream EVERY night this week. No details change at all night to night. Sorry it's such a long read, I wanted to include all the details I could remember.","So this is my recurring dream. I don't know why, for the last week, I have had this exact dream every single night. The details are the same every time, down to the pattern of the northern lights and even the meals we have. I have no idea if it's a sign or something but every time I wake up I'm almost panicking looking for her and wondering what happened to everything.¬† (Names, dates and some details changed in case I end up putting this on Reddit)¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†

A little background and people descriptions. Myself, for the sake of the story I'll use the name John¬† I'm 6'1"" roughly 245lbs, little heavy but muscular underneath,¬† the girl I reconnect with, we'll say Jennifer, 5'5"" I'm bad with guessing weight so I'll guess like 140-145lbs, healthy build, she has a son, 7 years old, let's call him Thomas. It starts with myself reconnecting with someone I used to talk to all the time and me falling again for them, even though she's made it clear that she isn't interested in a relationship at the current time.¬† The first 20 or so minutes of the dream is kind of a blur of 10ish months to roughly a year where we start talking more and she admits that she's been starting to get feelings for me and we start seeing each other then started officially started dating after a couple months and the relationship flourished and eventually she moved in with me. By the time the first year or 20 minutes of the dream is over, we are happily living together and planning our first vacation together up to my families camp on a small lake in Maine, way up towards the border of Canada,¬† which is where the good part of the story begins.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†

Day 1:¬†August 28th,¬†I wake up just before my 6AM alarm, a slight chill to the air outside, no one else is awake in the house, I roll over and see Jennifer laying next to me, a single ray of light coming in through our bedroom window just missing her closed eyes. ""Glad that isn't in her eyes, she's probably still exhausted from loading up the truck with me last night"" I think to myself. I lean over and kiss her on the cheek and still blush like that first time I kissed her when I was so nervous I almost missed. I climb out of bed, get dressed quietly¬† and silence my alarm so she can sleep a bit longer. I head downstairs and start a¬† cup of coffee for myself, medium roast with fresh milk from the farm and a spoonful of sugar. I then put her pod in the coffee pot and her favorite mug under the spout, light roast and put her favorite creamer at the front of the top shelf on the fridge.¬† I hear light footsteps upstairs then coming down the stairs. Her son appears in the doorway to the kitchen."" Good morning Mr. John""""Morning Tommy. Are you ready for the big trip today"" I ask after a sip of my coffee.¬†He looks at me, still half asleep and smiles saying ""Yea I am but momma said its a long drive away. How far is a long drive?"" he asks, while looking to see what cereal we have in the pantry.¬†He chooses fruity pebbles and as I'm pouring him a bowl of them I tell him ""it's about a 12 hour drive. So if we leave at 7 this morning we will be in the truck till 7 tonight""¬†""Oh man, I hope momma charged my tablet cause that's almost forever"" Tommy says before taking a big bite of his breakfast. As he's eating his breakfast¬† I hear Jennifer¬†coming down the stairs so I start brewing her coffee. She pokes her head into the kitchen and says ""there's my favorite guys, I'm gonna shower quick so if anyone needs the bathroom, hustle"" I stand there almost half leaning against the kitchen sink, just lost in her absolute beauty, wondering how I could have ever gotten so lucky to have her in my life. She looks at me and says ""earth to John"" I snap out of my daze and ask what she said. ""I asked you to make my coffee when it's¬†done brewing space cadet. You get that look every time I walk in the room."" I blush again and say I can make it. She give's me a smile and says ""I love you"" ""I love you too"" I reply. She goes back around the corner across the dining room to get in the shower. ""You're in love with my momma aren't you"" tommy pipes up from his bowl of cereal. ""More than you'll ever know buddy"" I say as I ruffle his hair ""that's why this vacation is gonna be so incredible, you and your momma are gonna get to spend a week where I used to go every summer when I was your age all the way through when I graduated high school"" I tell him. I make Jen's coffee and help tommy clean up from his breakfast and tell him to go grab some of his favorite stuffed animals for the trip. As he hurries back up the stairs, Jen comes out of the bathroom to the kitchen in a pair of yoga pants and a tee shirt cause I told her to dress comfortable for the trip. She walks by her mug on the counter and walks right to me and wraps me in a hug and I feel the world melt away around me as I hug her back and hold her close. We share a short, sweet kiss and she thanks me for making her coffee and she walks over and grabs it, taking the first sip, I see her shoulders relax and a smile tug at her lips. ""Perfect as usual"" she says sweetly. ""Is everything ready to leave?"" she asks between sips. As I put my empty cup in the sink, I turn to her and give a nod. ""Tommy is upstairs grabbing a couple stuffed animals for the trip"" I say as we hear him coming back down the stairs. He rounds the corner with a few stuffed animals including a little bear I had gotten him for Christmas. Jen and Tommy start heading out to the truck as I do a final walkthrough of the house making sure all the lights and fans are off. I glance outside and see tommy getting buckled into his booster seat. I go back to the computer room and open my small safe and take out a small velvet box and open it. Inside is the most beautiful golden ring with the perfectly cut¬†Amethyst you'd ever lay your eyes on. This was gonna be a week that none of us would soon forget. I close the box and tuck it into my last bag to load in the truck. I get into the truck and put the address into the GPS and we set off for the back country. Most of the drive is uneventful, cruise control set at 75 and the truck just rolls along, playlist just scrolling for hours with the occasional rest stop and fuel stop cause, well its a full size truck with a V8. After roughly 11 hours of traveling, we arrive at my aunt and uncles house (we talked beforehand and decided it would be smarter to go there the night we arrived so we weren't trying to setup at the camp while exhausted from traveling all day) We get out of the truck and I get tommy out of the backseat and carry him since he is fully passed out. We approach the door and my uncle opens it and greets us with open arms in his usual eccentric way. ""you guys look exhausted from the drive, that's why we usually fly when we come down for a visit"" Jen and I exchange looks with a smile as he keeps rambling on about everything and showing us to the room we will be spending the first night in. I brought Tommy into the bedroom my cousin used to sleep in and put him on the bed with his stuffed animal and a blanket and take his shoes off. Jen comes in and we tuck him in. We walk back into the living room and I give a proper introduction of Jen to my Aunt Lisa and Uncle Frank. Aunt Lisa, being the gabby old lady she is, sits down on the couch with Jen and starts asking the normal questions you would expect family to ask. Uncle frank motions for me to go with him out to the front porch so I follow. As soon as we are outside and out of earshot he turns and smiles at me and asks ""do you think she knows what's gonna happen this week"" I reply ""I hope she doesn't, I want it to be a surprise for her."" We walk over to the truck and I look to make sure the coast is clean and I show him the ring. He smiles and puts a hand on my shoulder and says ""I remember when you were just a young lad coming up here every summer, always working on a project with me or your cousin in the shop or helping with the airstrip outback, I never thought you would settle down."" I looked down at my feet then up to the stars and smiled and said ""I thought the same, Jen is truly and amazing woman and has showed me how to be loved and love genuinely. I couldn't imagine life without her."" Just then the door pops open and Jen asks if I could grab her water bottle out of the truck and I yell back ""absolutely I can sweety"" She closes the door and I look at uncle Frank and we burst out laughing about how the surprise was almost spoiled day one. As we turned to head back into the house, high above there was a faint light dancing as if knowing, it was almost their time to shine.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†

Day 2: August 29th. I wake up, roughly 8:15AM, Jen is out like a light next to me, lightly snoring, but still as beautiful as the day I first laid eyes on her. I climbed out of bed and as usual, kissed her cheek. I walked out of the room into the hallway and headed for the kitchen and hear tiny footsteps run up behind me and tommy hugs me from behind and asks ""where are we, this doesn't look like a camp"" I explained to him that while he was sleeping in the truck we figured it would be easier to spend the first night at my aunt and uncles house. as we walk into the kitchen, Frank is making pancakes on the griddle. He glances over and says good morning to us and keeps cooking. ""Hi Tommy, you can call me grandpa Frank if you want, I'm Johns uncle"" Tommy looks at me and whispers ""can I just call him Mr. Frank"" I whisper back ""ask him, not me bud"" as I stand to make my coffee. Tommy then asks and and uncle frank says ""you sure can, now how many pancakes would you like"" I start making my coffee as the conversation continues between Frank and Tommy. Aunt Lisa comes up to me and says ""Jen and I had a wonderful conversation last night even though she was quite tired"" she the leans in and said ""frank told me about the ring"" and she pats me on the shoulder and goes about her morning routine.¬† After a couple sips of my coffee, I start one for Jen out of habit and roughly a minute later she comes walking down the hallway. Her hair was a bit of a mess but still perfect. She motioned for me to come over so I walked over, hugged her and gave her a kiss on the cheek ""what's up sweety"" I ask she shyly looks around and whispers in my ear ""where is the bathroom"" I chuckle lightly and point her back down the hall to the door next to the room we slept in and told her ""that door"" She nods and quickly turns around and sleepily shuffles down the hallway. I return to the kitchen and put her creamer in her coffee and stir it. A few moments later she walks back into the kitchen, picks up her coffee takes a sip and asks ""why is the heat on, it's August?"" Frank and myself laugh and he says ""Welcome to Maine sweetheart"" as he points at the thermometer on the widow above the sink. 45 degrees outside. Jen's eyes open a bit more and she says ""I'll be right back"" she sets her coffee on the counter and goes back down the hallway towards our room. Frank puts a few pancakes on her plate and I set her coffee next to it and we both chuckle a bit and she comes back into the kitchen wearing my sweatpants and says ""much better"" as she sits next to Tommy and starts eating her pancakes. Frank and I start talking about the camp and how its about an hour drive cause nothing is close in northern Maine. He tells me that the camp to the left of the one we are staying at is my other Uncle Charles and Aunt Kayla and then the camp to the right is some long time friends of the family and everyone is excited to meet Jen and reconnect with me since I haven't been up there in 10 plus years. As we get ready to leave after breakfast and everyone using the restroom, we head for the door and uncle frank stops us and says come to the living room window so we all walk over and in the yard next to my truck is a massive moose just walking across the yard. I smile remembering the many summers seeing them up here but Jen, having never been to Maine, Has never seen one before and is taking video on her phone with this look of amazement in her eyes. We watch for a couple more minutes as he continues across the yard and into the woods behind the house. Tommy turns to me and asks ""can we come up here every summer"" with the same look of awe in his eyes as his mother. Frank says ""you guys are welcome to come up whenever you want, You're family"" as we head to the door I look at him and he gives a nervous smile and we both chuckle because they are not technically family yet, soon though. We then travel and hour across the backwoods down small roads, over creeks and down some roads that didn't even show up on the GPS. When we arrived at the lake, there was an overwhelming sense of relaxation. No cell service, no noise from the road, just nature. We pulled into our camp, a small cabin about 30 yards from the lakeshore and I see a slight smile on Jens face as she undoes her seatbelt and starts to get out of the truck. I climb out and help Tommy out of his seat and we walk around to the other side and join his mother in the sunlight and warmth. We spend the next 20 minutes moving out luggage into the cabin, Including the now useless cellphones and our wallets and opening up the windows to let the fresh air in. As we unload the truck uncle Frank walks up and hands me a small case from under the seat of his truck and calls Jen and Tommy over. ""I know you already know this"" pointing to me ""but I wanna give everyone this knowledge"" he gives a 10 minute speech about food safety and not leaving even a crumb out cause bears can smell it and may come looking for food. He hands me the small case and a key for it ""it was your grandfathers, when you leave, drop it back off at the house"" I nodded knowing exactly what it was. Tommy got his swim trunks on and we went down to the lake for a bit. Jen and I stood knee deep in the water, me with my jeans rolled up and her back in her shorts she'd had on first thing this morning when she woke up,¬† feeling the semi cold water, slightly warmed from the sun, flow back and forth and relaxing. I wrapped her in a hug and she hugged back and said ""this is really nice but I'm hoping it warms up a bit"" Tommy was sitting in the water on a little log and splashing ""the water is fine momma, you just gotta dive in"" Almost sensing my devious smile, she goes to pull from the hug and turn to me as I said ""yea momma, dive in"" and started to pull both of us into the water. She caught her balance and I ended up falling in. Yea I wont lie, that water was cold but not as cold as I expected. Jen laughed as did Tommy and my uncle from the shoreline. I sat back and lounged out and just sat there with a smile on my face. ""Jen you should join me, it's not that bad."" She walked over next to me, looked at the sand in the water and said ""I have an idea"" and sat on my lap, as usual I blushed and smiled and laid my head on her back. She said ""this way I don't get all sandy first thing in the morning"" I thought to myself ""fair point"" we sat there for probably a half hour while Tommy kept playing in the water near us.¬† A few moments later, We looked back towards the shore and the folks in the other camps were waking up so we decided to get out of the water and go say good morning to everyone. As we walked up uncle Charles came hobbling over and gave me a big hug saying ""its been almost 15 years since I've seen you young man, How have you been?"" ""I've been good, better in the last year"" as I feel Jen walk up next to me and put her arm around my waist, ""this is Jennifer and the young man sitting on that stump by the firepit is her son Thomas"" I explained to him as Aunt Kayla walked over and right past me to hug Jen ""well hello to you too aunty"" I say holding my arms out to hug the air as Charles starts laughing ""your folks said you guys were coming up and Kayla has been excited to meet the young lady who got her nephew to become a family man"" As he's saying this I turn and Aunt Kayla has Jen in a hug and is talking her ear off but Jen looks so comfortable meeting my family, further confirming that she is the one. The older couple that was long time friends of the family at the next camp over stopped by as we were getting ready for lunch and shared stories of when I was just a little lad and told me about my family history further back than I knew. We all had subs for lunch and sat around for the afternoon just talking about everything under the sun. We ended up back in the lake for a couple hours in the afternoon when it was a bit warmer. Tommy stayed by the shore with the older folks and they were building sand castles and talking about school and how times have changed. Jen and I were a little ways into the lake, shoulder deep just staring into each others eyes smiling when she said ""I wouldn't mind coming back up here every summer for a week to get away from everything back home, Like frank said Were family at this point"" I blushed and we both giggled. She then asked the question I had been waiting for since we arrived. ""so we've been all through the cabin and I noticed something is missing from inside. Where is the bathroom?"" At this, I laughed out loud and said follow me. So we swam back to the shore and walked up behind the cabin and there before us, a true rustic outhouse. She looked and me, then it, then back to¬† me and kinda pushed her knees together and said ""please tell me your kidding, like please"" I looked at her and said ""This is real, we're roughing it this week"" She looked at me and was like ""this isn't gonna be fun but I still wanna come back every summer"" then opened the door, looked back and shooed me away while I chuckled. I walked over to the truck and grabbed the fresh package of toilet paper I had grabbed before we left, took out a roll and went back over to the outhouse. She knows me too well cause as I walked up, the door opened a crack and her arm appeared and said ""thank you hun"" ""no worries sweety"" I replied as I walked back down to the shoreline to see everyone else. We were discussing dinner plans for the evening when Jen rejoined us. ""Perfect timing, you can help peel potatoes for the home made fries while we start the burgers on the grill. We had a large dinner that night and all watched the sunset across the lake. ""I'm gonna get a fire goin in the pit if you guys wanna grab some logs from the pile"" uncle Charles said pointing towards a pile between the camps. Jen and I grabbed a few logs to start for the fire as the older folks were setting up chairs around the pit. We sat there till Tommy fell asleep and Jen had me carry him to the cabin then we returned to the fire. We all sat around, chatting about life and our goals and then my aunt asked me to tell the story of how Jen and I met and I said that'll be a story for tomorrow night as it's getting late and the fire is almost out. We all agreed and called it a night. As we closed up the cabin and got the little woodstove goin for heat that night, a few sparks flew up and out the chimney and joined the northern lights, just a little brighter this night.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†

Day 3: August 30th The Big Day. 630AM I didn't sleep much that night, part excitement about what I had planned and part reloading the woodstove every couple hours. I opened the shades and the sun was just tickling the tops of the trees on the far side of the woods behind the camps. Tommy was sleeping like a rock on his¬† little bed with his stuffed animals and a couple blankets and Jen was snuggled up in her sleeping bag under the covers. I looked at her, my heart filled with joy as I leaned in and kissed her forehead.¬† On the little counter, I had plugged the coffee pot into the one outlet in the cabin. I started my coffee then set up Jens for when she woke up. I walked outside and it was quiet. The birds were just waking up, all was right in the world. A single loon was out on the water making small ripples and he floated along. I took a sip of my coffee and stood there for a long moment, just then Jen walked up beside me with her coffee and laid her head on my shoulder and said ""good morning hun"" I turned my head and kissed the top of hers and said ""good morning sweety"" we walked over and sat down at the fire pit and drank our coffees while talking about how the trip has been so far and she said despite the outhouse she was having a wonderful time. We heard stirring in the cabin as Tommy woke up wondering why people stay in cabins when normal houses exist and we hear him complain about almost everything. Kids right? I then hear stirring over at the next camp and Aunt Kayla came over and sat with us and asked Jen how she liked the slower pace from the life we lived back home. Jen starred out across the lake watching the shadows get shorter and smiled and said ""so far I have no complaints, I haven't been this free from my life in a long time. No work calls, no people bugging me constantly. I can relax and not worry"" She put her head on my shoulder, took my hand and looked at me ""I have you to thank for this, I haven't been this happy in a while"" Just then Tommy came out of the cabin, walked over and climbed into my lap,¬† hugged his moms neck and said ""momma, you look happy, like for real happy"" and laid his head on my chest and thanked me for his mom being happy cause it made him happy. I could see Jen and aunt Kayla both starry eyed at this moment. I sat there smiling and said ""I will do whatever it takes to keep your momma this happy bud"" and rubbed his back.¬† About 15 minutes later uncle Charles poked his head out of¬† the cabin and saw us¬† all sitting by the fire pit. He came over with the little griddle and a pack of bacon and a carton of eggs and he said ""I'm starting breakfast"" while setting up the griddle. He made us all breakfast and we enjoyed it even though the bacon was a bit burnt, Tommy gave his to me cause he didn't like it too crispy. The day was pretty similar to yesterday, just a lazy day at the lake. Shortly after lunch Jen wanted to see town since when we cam through it was dark out so we got a shopping list from the other two camps and some money. We¬† made the almost two hour drive into town to pick up food and see what all was in town, I already knew, even in a city of 10 thousand, there wasn't much that was worth stopping at. We went to the chain store that we have back home and it was laid out almost identical so it was easy to get what we needed and didn't have to wander for too long for what we needed. As we checked out I saw uncle Frank at the next register over and we chatted while checking out then on our way out to the parking lot, He was only¬† a couple spots from us. He recommended a we stop by the little oval track across town for the race if we were looking to spend an afternoon doing something other than sitting at the lake. Jen said that sounds like it could be interesting and Tommy heard racetrack and was in, regardless of what was actually racing. We went over to the track and spent a couple hours watching all the different classes race, Tommy had a blast, Jen seemed to be enjoying herself and me, being a crew chief for a dirt racer back home was in my element. After the races and bringing Tommy by the pits to see the cars up close, we starter on the drive back to camp.¬† We got back about a half hour before dark and everyone was sitting around the fire. We unloaded the stuff we bought and told them we had gone to the races and they were like ""oh yea that was today huh"" we got Tommy put to bed and went back out to the fire and there was a chill to the air that kept us close to the fire. I went to grab a blanket, the ring in the box and start a fire in the woodstove. I got back as the fire was shrinking so I threw a couple logs on it and then my uncle said he was gonna turn in for the night and when I looked up to say good night, I noticed the northern lights, getting brighter behind him. I knew it was almost time. I sat down next to Jen and we watched the flames flicker for 15 or so minutes then they started to die down and as Jen went to get up to head in, I took her hand and stood up and told her to look up. She smiled and looked up and her jaw fell open in awe. The entire sky was full of the dancing northern lights. As she stood there , the reflection of them in her eyes, just looking all around I knew it was now or never. As she was back to me, I pulled out the ring box, got down on one knee and opened the box.¬† ""Jennifer"" she turned and looked down and met my eyes ""Will you marry me"" she then noticed the ring and the lights reflecting across the amethyst, matching what I had seen in her eyes, ""YES, YES I WILL"" she almost yelled. As I stood up to slide the ring onto her finger I noticed everyone that had gone in from the fire standing just off in the shadows. They were all clapping and congratulating us as we stood there in an embrace that couldn't be broken. She looked at the ring on her finger, still seeing the lights of blue and green dancing in the gemstone. ""I got pictures of the moment and the ring glinting in the dark"" my aunt and uncle said. This moment will live on forever. Everyone went back to bed after more congratulations and we sat in the cabin starring into each others eyes. ""With this ring, I want you to know, I mean forever, nothing will ever change that"" I said to Jen. She still had that look of awe and excitement across her face ""I would hope for nothing less"" she said admiring it in the dim light from the woodstove. She climbed into my lap facing me and asked how I¬† knew the lights were gonna be so vivid tonight and I told her I had¬† been studying local photographers work to see when they would be most visible during the times that the camp was open.

¬†Now the rest of the night, for reasons will not be put into the story(If there is interest, I can type it up and DM it), We'll say there was a lot of cuddles and snuggling in the truck as to not wake Tommy¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†

Day 4: August 31st.¬† I wake up to Jen in my arms, still feeling like last night was a wild fantasy. I slide my hand down to hers and feel the ring on her finger and I just smile and pull her closer.¬† I climb out of bed after holding her for another half hour and get dressed and start my coffee. I sit in an old rocking chair next to the woodstove and put in another log to warm up the cabin. I open the door and step outside¬† as the first light comes over the trees and shine across what looks like a light frost that vanishes as soon as the light hits it. I quickly close the door behind me and head for the outhouse, realizing this is gonna be a cold and miserable few minutes. After I finish in there, I head back for the cabin and notice the warmth has sunk into everything as I walk in and sit back in the rocking chair, looking at Jen while she sleeps. In all honesty, There isn't a more beautiful sight in the world at this point than watching her sleep. I wonder if she's dreaming as I sit back and take another sip of my coffee. Oh to be a fly on the wall in her dream, I can only imagine how perfect everything is inside her head. After a couple minutes, she says ""Take a picture, it'll last longer"" without even opening her eyes. I smile, walk over to her and kiss her on the forehead and she gets this ear to ear smile that just melts my heart on the spot. I sit on the bed and ask how she slept to which she replies ""I don't think I've slept that good in years."" She then pulls her hand out from under the covers and just stares at the ring, watching the light flicker as she moves her hand back and forth, ""it's like you went into my head and found the exact ring I've always wanted and you got the size perfect"" she says lightly, still smiling. She get's out of bed and makes her coffee then sits back next to me and lays her head on my shoulder. We start discussing the plan for the day: Pack everything up this morning and hangout at the camp till around noon then head back to uncle Franks house and spend some time there relaxing before we call it a night early for the long drive home the following day. Once we have the plan figured out, we start cleaning up inside the cabin and getting some stuff loaded in the truck as Tommy wakes up. We chat with Charles and Kayla while loading the truck and Charles mentions making breakfast again and wanders off to get everything to make it. Meanwhile, Kayla is just in awe of the ring, finally seeing it in the daylight. We all have a quiet breakfast and more light talk about the trip home and such and when they'll be able to post the pictures they took from this week, cause you know how older folks are, they wanna tell everyone about the moment they saw ""young love blossom and a new chapter start"". We let the truck warm up and get Tommy buckled into his seat and say our goodbyes and see you laters to family and friends alike. We drive back to Franks house and spend the afternoon relaxing and chatting about when we set dates for the wedding how we'll send them invites and make sure we keep them posted on the details of everything. We settle in and start watching a couple movies to wind down. After the first movie Tommy is asleep so Jen has me carry him to the bed he's staying in and we tuck him in then return to the living room for the second movie. About halfway through, Jen and myself are dosing off so we say our goodnights and goodbyes since we plan on leaving at first light the following morning. I open the blind before climbing into bed with her and we both look out the window and see the Aroura still dancing in the darkness ""they'll dance as long as our love lasts in this lifetime"" I say to Jen as I lean to kiss her on the cheek ""you're so sappy and I absolutely love it"" she replies, smiling at me and slides her hand up to our faces and lets the¬†amethyst catch the lights as it did the night before ""I think they like it"" she says, watching the light dance in the ring. ""I'm sure they do"" I reply, watching the lights dancing in her eyes and the ring ""I'm sure they do."" The lights continue waltzing across the sky as we both fall asleep, holding each other close.¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 

Day 5: September 1st. We both woke up when my alarm went off at 6am. I silenced my alarm and we looked into each others eyes and we both kinda half smiled and said we might as well get this show on the road. I got up and got dressed to go start our morning coffees and she got our stuff packed up in the bedroom. I made her coffee while she got Tommy up and ready to go and I was drinking mine. As we talked a little, I remote started the truck to let it warm up and melt the frost off of it. After we both finished our cups, we all made one last effort to use the restroom before we hit the road for the long drive home. As we walked out the door, I felt a hand on my shoulder and I jumped a little ,turned and saw uncle Frank standing there. He wrapped me in a hug and said ""congratulations again, she seems like a wonderful young lady and I haven't seen you this happy in many years"" I had a small tear in my eye as I hugged him and said ""Thank you Frank, for everything this week, it wouldn't have been as special anywhere else"" With that I said goodbye and headed for the truck. We headed south back towards home with the memories of a wonderful week still fresh in our minds. Again, the drive was mostly uneventful. A few rest stops along the way and a stop at the L.L.Bean flagship store because why not, it was just a slight detour. As we turned back onto¬† our road in the evening, I had this sense of ""this is the first day of the rest of my life and I couldn't be any happier"" When we pulled into the driveway I had a slight smile tugging at my lips and Jen, even though she was asleep, looked happier than she had before this trip. I parked in the driveway and started unloading everything back into the house while Jen and Tommy were sleeping. Once everything was unloaded, I carried Tommy up to his bed and tucked him with his stuffed moose that we got for him on our detour. I went back down to the truck and opened the door so I could try and carry Jen into the house (I'm a sucker for trying things that are old school romantic) as I go to put my arms around her she opens one eye and says ""I don't think so, I hate being carried"" and she slowly climbed out of the truck as I lightly chuckled ""I was gonna try"" I said and her smile said everything on her mind at once. I walked her into the house and we both sat on the couch and she laid across my lap and said ""five more minutes"" as she fell asleep again. I sat there, heart full of joy and thought to myself, yea five minutes should be fine and closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep.¬†

  
Thanks to anyone who made it to the end and I gotta ask, does anyone have any idea as to why I keep having this dream over and over?",1,1757893231.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False
1nh6ie7,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuillandPen/comments/1nh6ie7/harmless_flirtation_at_the_workplace/,Harmless Flirtation At The Workplace,"I'm into my retirement phase of life, though my weekend evenings are taken up with a 5-year-long piano gig at a local restaurant. The staff continue to be younger and younger as the years go by. To some of them, I could be their GrandFather or maybe Great-GrandFather. Yikes.

One such young lady has captured my imagination of late. She works as a hostess at this place, and part of her job is to offer me a coffee or two or three over the course of my shift. Flirtation set in as she brought me my second coffee one recent evening. ""Having you here makes my day,"" I told her and continued to play the song at the given moment.

""You make my day too,"" she said.

Minutes later, I inquired, ""Are you working tomorrow?""

Slight hesitation and then the yes answer. I countered, ""We'll get to meet Jennifer's new man. I guess he plans to stick around her entire seven hour shift,"" I said.

She responded, ""Wooo!""

I heard in that response, I could care two shits. I hoped to hear, ""I think more of you now.""

Current shift, ""May I offer you a tip. You have been great to me,"" I said.

""What?""

""May I offer you a tip. I think you deserve one from me,"" I said.

""If you want,"" she said. I gave her something that would not intimidate, nor be too sparse. A kind thank you.

  
""Want another coffee, Babe?"" she asked. Or, I hope she called me that nice expletive, babe.

""Just one more. I'll be out of here in 30 minutes,"" I said.

  
I imagined acting like a teenager with this hostess. We would go get a burger then find a back road to take things beyond coffees.

Conscience was nearby to remind me of my commitments in life: my wife, two adult children, four grandchildren, reputation among those who like my music, the final result, ""He turned out to be a dirty old man with lust consuming him.""

Is immagination is better spent on creating lives, events, scenarios, where others behave, misbehave, make the world a better place, cause havoc just by being, make a man's thoughts go to extreme good intentions or finding the bad girl, the sinner, and enjoying sinful eroticism just because?



Something quietly repeats, ""With every situation comes a loss and a gain. The choice of which is yours and mine.""

Now, I shall continue to sooth my mind, will, emotions, something the Bible calls soul, or self, or personality. (Psalm 131)  
I'll stick to keep writing for now. Better that than misleading a hostess!

Controls both the Worm's Wake (subterranean tunnel that spans a good chunk of the North American continent) and most of the old U.S.A's territory. Currently forced into trade with Black Harbor sailors. Ruled by the Merchant-King. Formerly at war with Stavil, but stopped after, due to the difficulties Stavil has with keeping maps up to date in such a large and poorly defined territory, scouts were repeatedly unable to locate any high value targets for the Wallen Army. 



Miami/Old City: Founded in the ruins of Miami by the Wallen Kingdom in an attempt to create landroutes through the Soflo Wilds, allowing direct trade between the Gulf of Mexico and Wallen. Abandonded after heavy losses during initial settling of the Soflo Wilds and subsequent price gauging when Black Harbor sailors were asked to ferry medical supplies and soldiers. Following total government collapse, it now exists as a no-regulations marketplace. 



Black Harbor: Formerly a (very) large group of outlaws and pirates on an ancient megarig (big scifi oil rig). Their sailors have developed techniques to not be immediately killed when they try sailing, which gives them total dominance over the Gulf of Mexico Economic Zone. Because of their ability to sail and their access to coffee (crucial to the industrialization of Wallen) and cocaine (used by the army as both a combat stimulant and an anaesthesic), Wallen was forced to recognize them as a state as a condition of doing business with them. Black Harbor sailors have blatantly refused to pay any tax or toll to the crown on any goods or travel in Wallen territory. 


Alectown/Soflo Tribes: Mysterious tribe in the Soflo Wilds. Unusually aggressive and xenophobic. Despite their lack of access to other nation's facilities, resources or knowledge, they have developed a variety of weapons and techniques which allows them to traverse the most hostile region in the known world. They come from somewhere on the only land route into Miami, which has become their preferred hunting ground in more recent years. Because of their deranged behavior, violent tendencies and adaptions to life in the Soflo, many Stavilmen or Miami residents believe they're demons. 




Stavil: Massive country with no clearly defined borders. It largely consists of villages who are only vaguely aware of Stavil's existence. Fought Wallen for years but was forced to give up after it became apparent that there was no way to actually mobilize such a massive standing army with their rudimentary communications network. Assisted Wallen in developing landroutes through Florida, which resulted in heavy Stavil casualties. Stavilmen and Alectowners are constantly maiming each other, which, over the years, has created a cycle of martyrs that has made ""become a caravan guard and go shoot some tribals"" the number one occupation for young Stavilmen. Has officially confirmed both the existence of Europe and their presence in Eastern Siberia, but many people have their doubts to the truth of any of that. 



Mexico: Chillin



Loyalists: Remnants of the National Guard. After Washington DC's advanced defence system triggered prematurely and the city was cut off from the rest of the world starvation ran rampant. This would eventually spark an uprising that would turn the city into a perpetual warzone for countless generations.

1nh6fl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1nh6fl0/september_solo_trip/,September solo trip,"Hi everyone! Just wanted to leave what I meant to be a quick (hot tip, its not, I warned you) trip report as I used this sub heavily to help plan my days and navigate my time in Paris - which by the way was fantastic. 


Details to note:
This is my second time to Paris, the last time was 2017 and I had a medium busy itinerary originally, but ended up arriving in Paris with a flare up of my COPD, which changed my plans a bit. 


Hotel: 
I stayed in the Sorbonne (Latin Quarter) at [Hotel La Lanterne](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SbyvCTxoifGqTAfm9) which I would whole heartedly recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in that area - bonus - it has AC and a free hammam/pool you can use as part of your stay. It also has those rainshower heads, but the good ones, not the ones you have to run around in circles under to get wet, and massive towels that actually wrap all the way around.  


Itinerary and observations:
Day 1: Delays meant my arrival time changed from 10am to closer to noon. It took about an hour to get through customs and pick up my luggage, then hopped in a taxi (before getting in, I confirmed 65 euros and told him I'd be paying by card and had zero issues) to arrive at the hotel around 2pm. 


Luckily I was able to check in early and as I wasn't feeling great, after unpacking and a breather, I grabbed an early dinner from [Ravioli Queen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1xPgAy4SJAXpEK1t6) across from the hotel - which was delicious, the pork dumplings were yummy and made fresh. 


Day 2: D'Orsay (11am tickets had been pre-purchased) there was no real line but I'd say it was moderately busy inside. Mostly people were clustered around the classics and the clock to get their social media I was here pics and so elsewhere was pretty quiet. 


On my way back to the hotel I stopped in at [Aux Merveilleux de Fred](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cek8QhoubTYv9srm6) for some fluffy clouds of something I don't know the name of but looked good in the window and I inhaled them immediately upon getting to my room. 


Dinner was at [L'Annexe de la Petite P√©rigourdine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DJQPnHUnJdr8R1VV6), I went at peak time and they had no issue with a solo diner and the wait staff were all really nice. Food was good. When I told the waitress I was going to be boring and get onion soup, creme brulee and wine, she told me I wasn't boring, I was 'classique', so that was nice lol


Day 3: Morning was Petit Palais for the Worth exhibition which I was very excited to get a chance to see, people even dressed up in period costume which was a lot of fun. One person had puffed sleeves so big Anne Shirley would have been jealous (iykyk).


Afternoon was Dior Museum, stunning set up though it was very overrun with influencers more interested in taking pics of their self than the actual museum items, at one point security had to chastise a few young girls as they were trying to do a full on photo shoot and making it difficult to see the displays. Be prepared to be on other people's social media in the background. 


They also had someone from Dior on site doing fine beadwork that you could watch and talk to/ask questions which was cool to see. My favorite part was where you look down into what a workshop would have looked like.


In the gap between Petit Palais and Dior, I grabbed a caffe freddo from [Caf√© Nuances - Triangle d'or](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xQKBbWuKnwjevJcQ9) pricy but tasty, and then scored what I thought was a random bench, only to discover I was on Avenue Montaigne. I got to watch people take pictures with the fancy cars parked in front of Plaza Ath√©n√©e and a constant stream of people dropping off deliveries of LV, Gucci etc. at the side door. 


Not sure if someone important lives there? They were certianly getting a lot of items in one day. As for the cars, the Bently was the star of the show, it was fun to watch the faces of guys who were bored of luxury shooping with their partners light up when they'd notice it, running over to do poses, you could tell they wanted to touch the car so badly, getting really close lol 


Dinner that night was at [Restaurant La d√©dicace avec terrasse ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WroSzkZxFPe3VjcP8)and was incredibly well priced and very yummy. It was the best value of the trip for the struggling Canadian dollar. It's a small little resturant run by the owner who speaks just a little English and was really lovely. While there, I started chatting with an American expat who asked if I was going to the English comedy night just down the street, she said it was good. I didnt go, but if you're visiting on a Monday and looking for something random, one of the bars near there has a comedy night. 


Note: if you like your steak well done, this is not the place for you. It comes out blue/rare and you can cook it a bit longer on the hot stone it's served on if you like it rare to medium rare.


Day 4: I decided to avoid all museums this day as it was the free Sunday and instead booked a full day champagne tasting tour with lunch from [MyWineDays](https://mywinedays.com/tour/champagne-wine-tour-from-paris). It was not cheap, but it included early morning pick up from the hotel (this was a big selling feature for me as the other ones were quite a distance with a 7am start), a croissant for breakfast and 7 generous tastings, lunch and then dropped off near my hotel at the end. 


It was a small group of 8 and our tour went to one of the larger houses first (Mumms) and then a medium house ([Collery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UyXdt5UgfPVqgzEd6)) and another co-op I can't remember the name of unfortunately, as well as a quick stop on the side of a vineyard to enjoy the view, snap some pics and another glass of champagne. The champagne from Collery was my fav (Grand Cru Brut, Pinot nior - chardonnay mix) and I ended up getting a bottle. The champagne cellar at Mumms triggered a pretty bad coughing attack where I'm sure everyone thought I had the plague, so if you've got any respiratory issues go prepared. The cool humidity cleans the chest right out. 


A leisurely walk back from the drop off point took me across Ile Saint-Louis, which I love wandering through, passing by Notre Dame and Shakespeare & Co, back to my hotel where I ended up grabbing Ravioli Queen for dinner again.


Day 5: Morning was the Louvre with 9am tickets and a quick pit stop at [Paris Baguette](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ShHvfdBgELp97fQ6A) to grab a latte and croissant to scarf down next to the Seine before my walk there, no complaints. 


The day before I received an email telling me that the museum might not open until 10am but to still show up for 9am. Everyone who had tickets between 9am and 10am were queued up and then we waited...and waited.. at one point a security guard came out and explained to everyone they were waiting on the curators who were having some sort of meeting. 


They opened the doors at 1030am, where people cheered and clapped (not me though, I'm from a big city and have a rep to uphold) and at which point there were crazy lines all the way around the pyramid. They ended up letting both the 9am and 930am ticket holders in at the same time. 


Side quest: I was approached by the charity scammers as I was heading into the museum, but I was prepared for it and a very stern no and headshake with zero eye contact had them bypass me for someone else, who unfortunately did stop. The only other time I saw a similar scam again was in front of Masion d'Isabelle on the weekend, they were loitering in front of the metro stop.


Afternoon was open, so I casually wandered back towards my hotel with an eye out for a caf√© to grab a late lunch. Unfortunately I made a bad choice and ended up with awful Croque monsieur that felt like I was trying to choke down wallpaper paste. 


I then headed to [Church of Saint-√âtienne-du-Mont](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bwwjBCS9BsrctzHe7) and had a little chat with the patron saint of Paris before returning to my hotel to rest my poor feet in the hammam. 


Dinner was at L'Annexe de la Petite P√©rigourdine again because I was too lazy to figure anything else out. The cheeseburger was not bad, the bbq sauce was...sauce.


Day 6: Today was Chateau de Versailles. I had 11am tickets because I'm not really an early morning person - yes it was stupid crowded when I got there. 


I accidently got on the wrong train (I caught the one that went to the other Versailles stop), a mishap that wasn't difficult to correct with some help from a local who got me on the right one despite my terrible french. Overall the RER to Versailles is very easy if your paying attention and use city mapper AND be specific that you want the Chateau (which I was not, damn you google maps). 


I spent 6 hours at Versailles between the palace and the gardens. I saw everything but the Grand Trion. This was the heaviest walking day and I managed to give myself a sunburn waiting in the line to get in, so make sure you pack the sunscreen or even an umbrella. I also ended up with a unfun blister on the pad of my foot, so if I had to redo I'd bring something for blisters as it made the following days challenging.


Note: The palace can be really confusing to navigate and I did see a lot of ppl go into one area and when you get to the end of it, it spits you into the gardens and you miss the rest because you can't re-enter. I saw a lot of confused people who I know ended up missing half the palace. There is a sign, but it can also be missed. You have to backtrack through to another set of stairs to get back into the courtyard. So if you only saw one wing, its probably that one. I think on the map it shows as entrance B, its the one with the hall of mirrors. 


Unfortunately, this day was also the only day I ran into someone who was not at all nice. The driver for the little train thing that takes you between stops. After very aggressively telling me I could only pay by card even though the sign said cash or card, she forced me to squeeze into seats that wouldn't fit all 4 of us - despite everyone trying, let's just say we were all blessed in the backside department. I ended up having to sit on one butt cheek, and practically hanging out of the little train...one good bump or sharp turn and I'd have been tossed out (trying to be light hearted here, but it really did have potential to be a bad accident) but she refused to give me another seat so I got off at the second stop. 


On the bright side, I had some laughter - we joked she was starting the strike early, and bonded over the trauma with a family from California and we were all very close after that ride lol


My favorite part of Versailles was the Queens Hamlet where I had a mini picnic with my treats from Laduree to celebrate surviving my ride of death, and a good chuckle at the fact that there's bathrooms in one of the mock houses now. I wonder how MA would feel about all these people invading her little cosplay space to snap selfies, do little dances and pee. Also, the size of the veggies in that garden are insane. There were hanging gourds the size of small dogs.


Dinner that night was at [Le Bistrot d'Henri](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9cRRr4Qb8f5KTct48) which if I remember correctly was a suggestion from this subreddit. I made reservations the same day on my train ride back and I'm still thinking about the gratin dauphinois. This was a bit of a pricy meal, but I felt it was worth it, the service was on point and I also got to have some great dinner conversation with the diners beside me.


Day 7: D-day aka Sept 10 aka the Strike!
I hung out near my hotel, got croissants from [Maison d'Isabelle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F5BDcywwoGDJAQ5s8) (3 of them, and i ate them all in one sitting, they were very good) and fresh squeezed OJ at the store next door to enjoy at the park ([Square Ren√© Viviani](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4xo5mCifKmAKSBzx9)) I spent quite a lot of of time either sitting or walking through this park during my trip. There was also some local wandering of streets. 


I didn't see any protests or anything protest related - to be fair the hotel is right next to a police station/museum (funny enough though, I did get to see some teenagers having great fun heckling the ones in the guard house the next day). 


In the afternoon I went to the No Diet food tour of Le Marais, which I definitely recommend - booked it through airbnb experiences. Again, everything was pretty chill, if not a bit quieter than usual. 


Pro-tip: The tour timed it so we could see the 6pm ringing of the [Le D√©fenseur du Temps,](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pGziaAMiafyazXpZ7) where it fights all 3 animals. Apparently not many people know about this clock? I mentioned it to a few others afterwards and they weren't familiar with it at all. 


As the tour wraped up it really started to pour, and I stepped on a man hole on the way back to the hotel. The water beneath it came flying up and soaked my entire foot and pant leg - I'm still trying to convince myself it wasn't poop water and I'm not going to grow another foot, watch out for those man holes! 


After changing and scrubbing my leg, I had a late dinner at [En Face de La Petite P√©rigourdine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GECM63jYsG3h4zGv8), I ordered pizza which was meh, they clearly didn't want me lingering and brought me the check immediately after clearing off my main, unasked. I definitely didn't need more wine or affogato after the life changing man hole incident.  


Day 8: Shopping and Musee Carnavalet.
In the morning I walked to [Trudon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u1xhQ3bzGBGHXfX89) which if I recall what the associate told me, is either the oldest candle maker in Paris or possibly France. I purchased a few gifts and a perfume for myself (45¬∞ which smells so good I'm obsessed, it reminds me of a vanilla earl grey on a cold day. You're cuddled up reading a book, the cup resting against your chest and the steam coming off it smells like the honey you used to sweeten it. Basically a hug in a perfume, anyhoo). 


They were a bit standoffish at first but one of the associates ended up approaching me and by the end he sent me home with a bag full of samples in addition to my purchases. While I was there, I saw bag after bag being picked up jammed with candles, they seem to be incredibly popular. I did a quick stop to drop off my bag of loot at the hotel and then continued on to [Melodies Graphiques](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BNXgNccYoyVuqeWj9) where I picked up a few more items and then made my way to Carnavalat. 


I'm a sucker for all things old, especially rooms that are reproductions, so I really enjoyed this (free) museum. I also made a random observation in passing to one of the people who sit in the rooms and he was so excited to talk to someone and break up the monotony he ended up taking me all around and telling me about the history of the museum and certain items as well as a bit about himself. 


It was really fun and he kept saying how nice it was to have a visitor talk with him instead of just asking where the bathroom was, he kept apologizing for his English (which was very good, certainly better than my French) and checking in that he wasn't taking up too much of my time. By the end I knew all about his son going off to Japan for uni the following week and he was going to miss him terribly. It was very sweet.

 
For dinner this day I went to [La Sirena](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dRwSHY6eZeyLEZ8VA) which was decent. The tiramisu was the highlight. Oddly, they had no bread for the table even though it was Italian food, literally everywhere else I went gave bread. Super weird. 


Day 9: Last day :( I was supposed to go to Chateau Fontainebleau but my flare up meant not a lot of great sleep the last few days and a nagging blister from Versailles told my 7am alarm to stuff it and I slept in instead. I did a bit of wandering and park sitting and then had my last dinner at [Bistro des lettres](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7h6QYg28WQh3iHQS7). 


This was the only place I went to that I didn't have a great experience. It took ages for someone to pay attention to me at the door to give me a seat, turns out they were all having a coffee break and smoke and had left one poor bus boy mopping up a massive spill, he tried to get someone's attention for me but with no luck. Just as I was about to leave, 2 waitresses came in and I did finally get sat. I will also say the food was good and service after that was decent. However, when the bill was brought, they tried to get me to tip - of all the food places I went to in Paris, this was the only one to try this. 


Summary:
Paris is what you make it. It can be awesome or it can be awful, it's about how you approach the hiccups and the people around you. A little bit of planning/research goes a long way, and make sure you build in buffers so you're not stressing out if something goes awry. I used wanderlog to create lists with all the places i wanted to go and eat at which puts it all on a map and makes it easy to see whats around you for spur of the moment things. 


Be kind to yourself if you can't do all your plans, which is what happened to me. This was my first trip with this illness and I was really embarrassed by what happened at the champagne cellar and frustrated that I was tired more than usual, but I refused to let it get to me.


The trains aren't as scary or hard to navigate as you may think, especially now that one ticket works for all the zones. I used the Bonjour RAPT app and loaded 4 tickets and had no issues. 


Personally I find picking one must do a day and scheduling it for the morning (ish) and then a free/flexible afternoon makes me the most happy and relaxed. I don't think that there's any time Paris is less busy when it comes to tourist attractions, so pack your patience and some spatial awareness (I'm looking at you people who stop dead in your tracks to consult your phone, or take pictures, especially in the middle of doorways and at the base of stairs/escalators. For the love of all thats holy, step to the side). 


Be nice/mindful of Parisians and the service staff as you're only experiencing a fraction of the chaos they deal with daily, so sometimes you just have to stuff 4 big butts in a small space and laugh about it. Start all your interactions with hello/bonjour/bonsoir etc. or at minimum a smile. I know you're flustered or in a rush, or it might not be as common where you live, but this is a basic that can make or break your experience with someone. I watched a security guard at the airport repeatedly reply to a woman with 'Bonjour madame' until she finally started her question with hello instead of immediately launching into her queries like he was chatGBT and not a human.


To the Parisians: 
Thank you for the grace with which most of you share your city with the constant influx of tourists. And every single one of you who speak English do it better than you give yourself credit for. ",5,1757892984.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,1.0,False

Yes could smell coffee, cologne, spices, but now it's nuts. I can pick up scents in my house both my family cannot detect, or I can smell the lingering effects well after a smell has dissipated. 

Not only that but with food I could taste that some things are more intense. I had rotisserie chicken from the store and the chicken...well tasted chickeny,  more in a bad way like fish too fishy (versus something good like cheese being cheesier yum). 

I wonder if this related to zep and perhaps since smell and taste are correlated if this helps with the not eating as much part. I also get more dry mouth so maybe it's drying up sinuses perhaps too, who knows. Anyone else with this finding? ",1,1757892967.0,Zepbound,4,1.0,False

We only had a few minutes to chat but he reported the following things-

Putting down a coffee mug and it being moved over within seconds of turning his back and dribbles being present as though someone was drinking it where none had been before.

Hearing her voice calling from upstairs, ""Hello, Hello? Is anyone there? Hello?""

A plant on the floor being turned right in front of his eyes while he was vacuuming. He said he didn't touch the plant and was a few feet away from it when it started twisting and turning on the spot. I believe the plant turning was the final straw and when he decided to sell üòÖ

I asked him if he had ever seen or heard anything from grandpa who had passed in 2010 and he said he saw grandpa and his uncle at the foot of his bed once smiling at him, he raised the covers over his head because he was scared; but when he lowered them back down, they were gone. He also said he could sometimes hear grandpa whistling in the basement and in the garage like he used to do when he was puttering around while woodworking when alive.

He said he had no apparitions of grandma and just the one of grandpa that one time.

My uncle was legit scared by all of this.

He's never seen anyone else, and neither of his parents followed him to his new house where he's lived for about 2 years at this point.

**Question:** 

Should I be at all concerned that grandma and grandpa were still in the house some 5 years after grandma passed and approximately 12 after grandpa went?

Is there a chance they're stuck or did they cross over; but just really like being home so they're hanging out there whenever they want?

**Sorry, hauntings aren't really my forte** üòÖ

Grandpa did die in the house and grandma wanted to die there too. We promised her she would; but unfortunately that didn't come to happen. Both were attached the property during their lives and wanted to die there for sure.

It may be worth noting that grandma and grandpa came to me a few months ago and asked me to go the house...

Also my dad is lingering in spirit at my moms house and following me and my son off the premises so I don't know if this is a family trait or something; but its certainly odd that both my dad and his parents are lingering after death ü§î

1nh62wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1nh62wb/some_advice_on_solving_the_twobody_problem/,Some advice on solving the two-body problem,"**What is this?**
The *two-body problem* refers to academics with career-oriented partners (often also academics) trying to land jobs in the same location. It's a play on the *three-body problem*, which famously has no closed-form solution. This is my advice after going through the process twice.

**What this is not:**
This is not general faculty application advice. For that, I recommend the helpful posts of [Sylvia Herbert](https://sylviaherbert.com/faculty-application-advice) and [Kira Goldner](https://www.kiragoldner.com/blog/job-market.html), who have already covered everything and have been part of the inspiration for sharing my experience.

This is roughly organized in the chronological order of when you should care. Note, my experience is based in North America and my field is STEM; there may be regional differences.

---

## tl;dr

1. Don‚Äôt take things personally: (most) people would like to help, they are just **TBTC** ‚Äì *Too Busy To Care*.
2. Be clear on what matters to you and your partner, and negotiate accordingly.
3. Stay positive and optimistic during negotiations.
4. You‚Äôll be dealing with multiple people, not the university as a single entity. This means many different priorities, but also many opportunities for miscommunication and lots of bureaucracy.

**TBTC** (see above) is the root cause of almost all issues I‚Äôve seen. Decisions that seem careless or even malicious usually stem from people being overloaded. I've found it helped to keep my sanity and stay positive to always remember that ""These people want to be happy, just like me. They really _would like_ to make things work out. They are just **TBTC**"".  

You can also use this to your advantage: **make their job easier**. Take the intiative to find out where you can plug departmental needs. Offer to do the leg-work communicating across departments: if the head of department says they need ask the Director of Undergraduate Studies about the current teaching needs, offer ""should I e-mail them directly, with you in cc'?"". If hiring you makes their life easier, it's more likely to happen.  

At one university, known for solving two-body problems well, the key difference I noticed is that they didn't rely on people doing a good job, they changed the system: a distinct service position called ‚Äúwork-life liaison‚Äù would handled dual hires ‚Äî not a dean juggling a dozen other roles. In short: they ensured the person handling this was not **TBTC**.

---

I will keep the writing as objective as I can, and occasionally give a bit of backstory of my own experience when I think it can be helpful to give texture/nuance. Some overall context to my story...
> My partner got an exploding offer at University A (UA), with assurances I‚Äôd get a PI-level position: not tenure-track (TT), but with the same responsibilities/privileges. Over half a year later, I was finally offered what was essentially a postdoc under a professor who was not aligned with my research goals (though a nice person).
> In the meantime, I applied broadly, got faculty interviews, and a TT offer from University B (UB). We then negotiated with both universities. UB quickly interviewed my partner and made two TT offers. UA eventually matched their original promise. We compared our options (see point 2 above). Although the offer from UB was technically more (two TT positions instead of one), it did not match my partner's priorities for other reasons, whereas the offer from UA did match mine. We decided to stay with UA as the place we would find most happiness.

---

## Typical setup

Usually, one of you gets an offer from Department A (the **primary**), and discloses the two-body issue. The department says ""we have a great track record at dual hires!"" and asks for the partner‚Äôs (the **secondary**) CV to forward to Department B (**host**) (assuming you and your partner are in different fields). I was surprised that they do not ask for more than just the CV (no research statement, etc. regardless of the position)... but they do want it immediately, so make sure that is polished beforehand.  
Handling the secondary hire then usually escalates to someone senior (vice-dean, head of department, etc.) who negotiates with the provost and host department leadership.
A successful outcome is that a position for the secondary, with guaranteed funding for the first N years (I've heard of anywhere between 1 and 5) being provided by some combination of the provost (aka university-level pot of money), the primary's department, and the host department. While 1/3 each is common, I've also heard of things being as one-sided as {75%, 25%, 0%}.

Many places have a standard template offer they can offer easily (e.g. a 2-year funded postdoc for the partner) but anything else is handled ad hoc and requires time and negotiation.

---

## Application Phase

### Know what you want

Have a clear, honest conversation about your values and goals, first with yourself and then with your partner. This helps you make fast, good decisions under pressure. Note, these negotiations may go very quickly, and even when they drag over a long time, there are often only few actual negotiation sessions (so, still making some decisions on the spot).

>In my case, there are two reasons to stay in academia: I find fulfilment in intellectual freedom, and mentoring students. So once I had _in writing_ PI status for grant applications and could advise students, everything else was bonus. My partner's priorities are different. This means we could compare two different sets of offers, and choose the one that would give us the most happiness as a team, rather than comparing them by their ""objective"" value. And while it took almost a year to get our final offer, the last round of negotiations happened over 2 weeks.

### Align your timelines

It helps a lot to go on the market at the same time. This means considering taking a postdoc or similar if your partner needs another year or two to graduate, or in general before they are ready to apply in the same cycle (this was our first mistake). If you do align, then:

1. You're both more mobile.
2. You double your chances by casting two nets.
3. Your partner having an offer (even somewhere else) gives you a lot more leverage. Leverage is key.

### Don't bring it up until you have a verbal offer

I initially planned to bring this up early: I wanted to maximize the number of dual offers, not the number of initial offers. Only one senior professor agreed with this reasoning; _everybody_ else told me not to bring it up until you have a verbal offer, including people at places I (or my partner) was interviewing at. I'm glad I heeded their advice.  
From the search committee's perspective, the worst thing that can happen is a failed-search, so anything that will make the hire more complicated is something they are strongly incentivized to avoid. Once they've committed to a verbal offer, it is suddenly a lot of work to go back and convince everyone to agree to go with someone else, and so the incentive is now very much to make these negotiations work.

### Apply to overlapping institutions

If you both apply to the same university:

* Best case is you both get independent offers (I have seen this happen).
* Even if not, having both CVs in the system makes everything faster and easier. Remember, everyone is **TBTC**.

---

## Negotiation Phase

### Get it in writing
Whatever agreements you have _must_ be in writing to be relied on, for many reasons.

* You are not negotiating with a single entity, but several people representing different interests. There are many opportunities for miscommunication, or different interpretations, often with no ill-intent but nonetheless with negative outcomes (for you).
* The various roles (dean, head of department, etc.) are rotating positions, and whoever made you assurances now may not be there in a year (or five) when you need them
* Most importantly, whoever made you a verbal promise will often be too busy to enforce it when the time comes. Having an official piece of paper means you don't have involve someone who is **TBTC**.

### Stay positive

Even if you feel you're being mistreated, you need to stay positive!

First, this is just frankly the only way to stay happy in the position if you do get it. Especially if you feel you're being mistreated (I certainly did), this can be difficult.
> In my case, when meeting old friends, I would complain about what was happening; too much, my partner pointed out. My partner was right, and I started to make an effort to tell more on positive stories. This has paid off.  

Second, one of the main concerns of the host department is, what if they get stuck with a bad apple. If, for any reason, there is concern that your presence in the department will cause friction, regardless how unjustified, it is safer for the department to just say no.

> In my case, there was a professor I had briefly talked to about working with. We decided not to (they were looking for a postdoc, which I wasn't interested in being), and we left it at that. Everything fine, I thought. Later, once I was negotiating for my actual (independent) position in the same department, I found it difficult to make headway and I couldn't figure out why. Luckily, a friend in the department gave me some clues, and I realized this professor felt I had been ungracious in not taking the position in their group. I reached out, we had a coffee and cleared the air, and everything was fine. From then on that professor has been very positive, and I am still baffled why they had felt negative in the first place ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. The moral is, even though I don't feel that it was my fault that there was friction, it was still my responsibility to defuse the situation.

### Leverage matters

Leverage helps. The *prestige* of your competing offer especially matters.
Note that (assuming your alternative is still academia), the prestige of your alternative institution will matter, a _lot_ (I was quite surprised to learn just how much Americans care about rankings...)!
Again, this boils down to **TBTC**: the person you're dealing with directly might not care and value you, but they (typically) need to go to the _provost_ to ask for resources to make the counter-offer. Talk about too busy! This means they don't have time to look at your profile in-depth, but will rely significantly on cognitive shortcuts... most notably, the prestige of your leverage.


### It's not personal, it's strictly business
Don‚Äôt feel bad negotiating or exploring other options. The people you're dealing with have been through this several times, they know the drill. Just keep it professional, don't lie or deceive, and no one will fault you (heck, they are likely to see it as a strength).

> In my case, I had suggested that my partner also re-apply once I started applying, and my partner felt bad shopping around since they had already accepted the position at UA. Since then we have seen several hiring calls where some if not most of the applicants were people who had just started a TT position elsewhere 1-3 years earlier (so, in similar positions).

> In my case, once I went on the market, the expectation was that the leverage from any offers would result us in staying at UA. I did, however, take all applications seriously, and we ended up almost moving to UB. All of the places I turned down, I was honest about why (we are solving a two-body problem), and they have always answered kindly and also encouraged us to consider applying again if we are looking to make a move in the future. Curteous, professional, and no hard feelings.

1nh60uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1nh60uf/building_belief_and_sp_situation/,Building belief and SP situation,"So where do I start? I‚Äôve known about the law for a little while now. I want to hazard a guess at approx. 3 years. I found out about it after a break up like I guess a lot of people do. I spent a lot of time reading and listening to Neville Goddard lectures etc and decided to try to manifest the woman who had left me back. In hindsight I was doing it for all the wrong reasons and was also still very much in a state of lack and I never saw any movement. I don‚Äôt think I really believed it either, I wanted to but there was always doubt that it is even possible in the back of my mind. 

I then met someone else and sort of forgot about it all tbh. However about 8 months into this new relationship I received a text message on from the woman I had previously tried to manifest back. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what it said but it was something along the lines of ‚ÄúHi, I thought about you the other day and just wanted to see how you are doing?‚Äù. This woman had previously blocked me and there was absolutely no contact at all. I ignored the message as I was happily with someone by this point and it‚Äôs only very recently that I have wondered if this was movement but I guess I‚Äôll never know for sure what her intentions with that message were now. 

Then the relationship I was in when I received this message ended. I made a lot of mistakes towards the end of this one and once again I tried the whole manifestation thing but I didn‚Äôt see any movement at all. In fact we were in contact for a little while and then she randomly blocked me out of absolutely no where and I am still blocked to this very day as far as know. Again I don‚Äôt think I really believed it was possible and was hurting a lot and searching for hope to a degree. 

Fast forward 2 years. I had stayed on my own. Mostly because I really wanted to become a more whole person and work on the issues I had brought to the table in the second relationship I mention. Then out of nowhere I met someone and when I say I fell hard, I fell hard. She was / is quite literally the person I have always wanted. I can‚Äôt tell you how much I love her and how much it all just clicked. It was all very quick but it was reciprocated and mutual and for about 3 months it was absolutely perfect. Then my insecurities started to show up. I think I loved this woman so much that I just started to feel not good enough and that she could leave at any moment. Ultimately I pushed her away and she left, it was a little back and forth for a few weeks but ultimately she completely ended it on 26/08/2025 and has since blocked me and told me not to contact her and that there is no chance she will ever change her mind or want to work things out and that she doesn‚Äôt love me anymore. 

At one point this woman was talking about settling down with me and I totally believe that I caused the distance. I literally believed it would happen and it absolutely did. When we met I was in a good place emotionally. I was confident. Chilled out. Up for a laugh. As my attachment to her grew I became less self assured and I‚Äôd question her feelings for me etc. 

I have since started going to therapy because as much as I believed I had worked on myself in the time I was on my own. I think my issues arise from being with someone that I love and that is when they seem to come out for me. I have also come to the conclusion that I really love this woman and that I want a future with her. It‚Äôs not because my ego has been dented, it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôve been rejected, I honestly think we were and can be great together. The problem right now is that the 3d makes this look impossible. 

So here I am. Wondering if this is real again. Trying to build belief. I started trying to manifest smaller things. So far out of 7 things, 6 have come to fruition. The problem is that I question whether they were too likely to happen anyway. I will list them below and if you have any suggestions of things I could try then I would love to hear them. 

Lastly, if anyone has success stories with SP‚Äôs that said very final things or any material I should read as well as general encouragement, tips or advice I would really love to hear from you. 

1) See a bright pink car. Yes, have seen multiple since. 

2) See a bright / lime green car. Yes, have seen multiple since. 

3) See a bright orange car. Yes, have seen multiple since. 

4) See a badger. Yes, saw one at the side of the road. Granted it was dead. They aren‚Äôt common to see where I am though. I think I‚Äôve seen one once before in my life. I am 33 years old. 

5) See a double rainbow. I didn‚Äôt see one in person but a friend of mine at the pub showed me a picture of one a couple of days later. I then also saw a picture that was labeled as a ‚Äútriple rainbow‚Äù on instagram but tbh I could only see a double rainbow in it. 

6) Get a free coffee. This one blew my mind the most. I assumed I was going to get a free coffee and about a week later a friend asked me to meet them at Starbucks after work. I thought, my god, I‚Äôm going to get a free coffee and then my friend cancelled and it never happened. I forgot about it tbh. But about a week after this. I was at work. Our boss called my colleague and asked if I wanted anything from Costa. I ordered a coffee and went for lunch. When I got back it was on my desk. I had just received a free coffee. 

7) That I would see / speak to / bump into an old friend from school. I haven‚Äôt seen this person for 4 years and prior to that I hadn‚Äôt seen him since school. This one has not come to fruition yet but I also think I have some doubt about how possible this one actually is so need to persist a little more. 

Sorry that this has been really long. The truth is I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôve lost someone I love forever and I keep wondering if I‚Äôm doing things correctly or not. ",1,1757891873.0,lawofassumption,0,1.0,False

I love her to bits but she has destroyed so much stuff since getting her on the 11th of April. 

She still needs so much work done with her because she may have passed puppy training (something I was genuinely worried about considering how easily distracted she became around the other dogs in the group. She was the youngest by far) but she only seems to know what to do and actually listens at certain times of the day outside of an actual training session. 

For example, when training her outside using treats and the commands taught in the training, she does great. She definitely understands what is being asked of her. Yet, as soon as she is inside, since she's an inside and outside dog, it's like everything she knows how to do goes out the window. She barely listens or does as she's told when inside, except for the dogs dinner time. She is perfectly behaved at that time. She even knows that once she has finished hers that she has to sit and wait out of the way to allow Jackson (my housemate's dog, the little fluffy one in one of the pictures) has finished and completely walked away before she goes to see if there's any leftovers she can eat. 

Though on saying this, I will say that she is getting better each day. She's calmed down a lot since I got her, which is nice, but she's still teething so chewing everything she can get to. She has so many toys for this reason. 

Anyway, I just thought I'd share some pictures since it's been a while. Please feel free to add pictures of your pups in the comments and if you have any advice on how to transition what she understands from training sessions into everyday indoor life, please let me know. 

The only other thing I will add is that Happy appears to be genuinely scared of Jackson whenever Jackson growls at her, which is a lot of the time. He is perfectly nice to her on his terms but if not, even if she is walking towards the couch or past the coffee table towards me, if Jackson thinks she's getting to close to his space even when she's not, he growls and scares her of.  We took him to meet her before I adopted her and he was fine so I don't understand why this is happening or how to stop it because it feels like Happy is afraid of him at times.

* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a friend?

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!

The bushy tickle licked Carl‚Äôs lips, his mustache was chatting with his boss again. ‚ÄúI must trim him‚Äù Carl thought as he tried not to snigger due to the unrelenting tickling.
In this world everyone had a mustache, women, men, children and even babies. Those without mustaches could not live. It was just one of those things.
The mustache would talk for you, they would chat with you. Really, they were your way into the world. In fact, no one actually ever chatted to each other anymore. You ever just really chatted with your mustache.
Carl‚Äôs was a proper brown-noser. It called Mr Finnegan ‚Äòsir‚Äô and laughed a fraction too long at his tired jokes. Right now, it was going on about the quarterly reports, its voice a smooth, confident baritone that Carl himself had never possessed. The hairs, thick and brown, vibrated with false enthusiasm, brushing against his philtrum, sending a maddening itch across his skin. He resisted the urge to scratch. It was seen as poor form, like interrupting.
Outside, a soft Irish rain misted the window of the office, blurring the grey stone of the building opposite. 
The room smelled of damp carpets and lukewarm tea. Carl stared at the screen of his computer, the cursor blinking on a spreadsheet he‚Äôd finished an hour ago. He just wanted to go home, to sit in his quiet flat with a proper mug of tea and a book. He wanted the low hum of the fridge and the patter of rain on the glass. He wanted the ceaseless, charming chatterbox on his face to just be quiet. For one evening. 

That‚Äôs what he wanted. His own mustache, Seamus, was what he called it in his head, was now agreeing to take on extra work. Work Carl would have to do. He felt a familiar, hot knot of resentment in his gut. He just sat there, hands flat on his desk, while Seamus sealed his fate for the weekend.
That night, the key turned in the lock of his small flat. The door clicked shut behind him and the sounds of the city fell away. He dropped his bag by the door. The relief was immediate.
‚ÄúGrand day, all the same,‚Äù Seamus chirped from his lip. ‚ÄúFinnegan is in a powerful mood. Thinks the world of us. That extra work will put us right in his good books.‚Äù
Carl walked into the kitchen and filled the kettle. He stared out the window at the wet slate roofs across the street.
‚ÄúA promotion could be on the cards, you know,‚Äù Seamus continued, its tone conspiratorial. ‚ÄúWe play this right, we could have a corner office by Christmas. Imagine that. A view of the river.‚Äù
The kettle clicked off. Carl poured the boiling water over a tea bag in his favourite chipped mug. The steam warmed his face.
‚ÄúDid you hear what Deirdre‚Äôs one was saying by the lift?‚Äù Seamus prattled on. ‚ÄúHer fella is taking her to Spain. Spain! Can you credit it? Not a drop of rain for weeks on end, they say.‚Äù
Carl took his tea and went into the sitting room. He sank into his worn armchair. He closed his eyes. The tickle was still there, a phantom itch. The voice was still there, a constant companion he had never asked for. He had to do something. He couldn't take another evening of it. He walked into the bathroom, the one with the flickering bulb. He opened the mirrored cabinet and took out a small pair of silver nail scissors. He looked at his reflection. His face, pale and tired. And below his nose, the thick, vibrant, chattering mustache. Seamus was mid-sentence, rambling about a new type of filing system. Carl lifted the scissors. The cold steel touched the hairs. With a sharp, decisive snip, he cut one of the longest, most ticklish strands.
Seamus stopped.
The silence was not peaceful. It was a vacuum. A sudden, terrifying void in his head and on his lips. It was the loudest thing he had ever heard.
The next morning, the silence held. Carl woke with a knot of dread in his stomach. He stood in front of the mirror, examining his mustache. It looked the same, just as thick and bushy, but it was inert. Lifeless. He wiggled his nose. Nothing. He drank his tea. The quiet was heavy, like a wool blanket soaked in water. He left for work. The air was cool and damp. On the street, the morning was filled with the usual hum of conversations. A woman‚Äôs high, feathery mustache complimented a man‚Äôs gruff, tweed-like one on the fine morning it was. Their owners walked past each other without a glance. Carl felt naked, exposed. His upper lip was cold.
He bought a paper at the corner shop. ‚ÄúMorning, Carl,‚Äù chirped the shopkeeper‚Äôs magnificent white walrus mustache.
Carl nodded. He held out a coin. His own mustache remained utterly, damnably silent. The shopkeeper, a man named Mr. O‚ÄôConnell, stopped what he was doing. He looked at Carl‚Äôs face. His eyes narrowed. The bonhomie vanished from his walrus mustache. It drooped slightly, its voice gone. O‚ÄôConnell gave him his change, his movements stiff. He did not look at Carl again. The interaction took five seconds and left Carl‚Äôs hands trembling.
Work was worse. He sat at his desk, pretending to read emails. The office was a sea of murmuring mustaches, a constant multi-layered drone of pleasantries and work-talk. His silence was an island. Deirdre from accounting walked past. Her pencil-thin mustache, which always spoke in a breathless whisper, said, ‚ÄúMorning, Carl.‚Äù When his own gave no reply, her mustache seemed to shrink back. Deirdre‚Äôs eyes flicked to his face, wide with something like fear, and she hurried away.
At ten o‚Äôclock, Mr. Finnegan loomed over his desk. Finnegan‚Äôs mustache was as grey and severe as a granite tombstone. It did not waste time with greetings.
‚ÄúThe preliminary figures for the Connaught region, Carl. Where are they?‚Äù the granite mustache boomed. Its voice seemed to vibrate in Carl‚Äôs teeth.
Carl‚Äôs heart hammered against his ribs. He opened his mouth, but no sound came from his lips. Only a dry click. His own mustache, Seamus, did nothing. It was just hair. He pointed at the screen, at the completed spreadsheet.
Finnegan‚Äôs eyes, small and hard, bored into him. His mustache‚Äôs voice dropped. ‚ÄúIs there a problem, Carl?‚Äù
Carl shook his head. He felt sweat prickle his hairline. He wanted to explain. An accident. The scissors. It was just a trim. But he had no way to say it. He was a mime in a world of broadcasters.
‚ÄúI see,‚Äù the granite mustache said, though it was clear Finnegan did not see at all. The voice was cold, stripped of all its usual corporate warmth. ‚ÄúGo home, Carl. Take the rest of the day. Sort yourself out.‚Äù
It wasn‚Äôt a suggestion. It was an execution. He packed his bag, the gentle hum of the office chatter feeling like a physical force pushing him out of the room. No one‚Äôs mustache said goodbye. He walked home through the grey streets, a ghost.
The days that followed blurred into a silent, isolating nightmare. A letter arrived, formally terminating his employment due to ‚Äòa fundamental communication breakdown‚Äô. His landlord‚Äôs mustache left a clipped, angry message on the answering machine about the rent, which was due. Carl had money in the bank but he couldn't ask for it. He couldn‚Äôt perform the simple transaction of existing.
He grew thin. Hunger became a constant, dull ache in his belly. He tried writing notes, but people reacted with suspicion and disgust. A young fella in the bakery, his barely-there starter mustache squeaking with indignation, called it ‚Äòunnatural‚Äô and refused to serve him. The written word was an obscenity, an antique tool for perverts and criminals. Communication was meant to be clean, effortless, groomed.
He saw them on the streets more often now, or maybe he just noticed them. Officers of the Grooming and Guidance Authority. The GGA. They walked in pairs, their uniforms a crisp, severe black. Their mustaches were all identical: sharp, black, and narrow, like a slash of ink. They spoke with a unified, authoritarian tone that cut through all other chatter. They were the arbiters of order. He saw them stop a man whose ginger handlebar mustache had one side drooping sadly. They escorted the man into a dark van. Carl started taking the backstreets.
One afternoon, driven by a gnawing hunger, he was standing outside a cafe, watching people through the window. He watched them lift cups to their mouths, their mustaches carrying on conversations without pause. It was a ballet of effortless connection from which he was exiled. He saw a woman sitting alone, nursing a coffee. She was young, with a fall of dark hair. Her mustache was a small, neat auburn thing, but it was perfectly still. She wasn't talking to anyone, not even herself. She looked up and her eyes met his. There was no shock or disgust in them. Just a flicker of recognition.
She gave a tiny, almost imperceptible nod towards the alley beside the cafe. Then she turned back to her coffee. Carl‚Äôs heart stuttered. It could be a trap. The GGA could be anywhere. But the gnawing in his gut was worse than his fear. He waited a minute, then slipped into the narrow, damp alley. It smelled of bins and stale beer.
She was there, waiting for him at the other end.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in a spot of bother, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù
The voice startled him. It wasn't her mustache. It was her. The words came from her mouth, low and a little rough, as if they hadn‚Äôt been used in a while. She pulled down the collar of her coat. In the grey light of the alley, he could see the faint, silvery line of a scar on her upper lip. She had no mustache at all.
‚ÄúMy name is Aoife,‚Äù she said, her own voice quiet but clear. ‚ÄúCome on. Before someone sees you.‚Äù
He followed her through a labyrinth of back lanes and forgotten passages that smelled of moss and decay. They came to a heavy wooden door at the back of a pub. She unlocked it and led him down a flight of stone steps into a cellar. The air was cold and smelled of earth and spilled porter. A single bare bulb hung from the ceiling, illuminating a small, dry room off to the side. There were three other people there, sitting on old crates. A thin, older man with deep-set eyes and a scar identical to Aoife‚Äôs. A young man, barely out of his teens, who was anxiously stroking his own silent, limp mustache. And a woman with a magnificent, flowing blonde mustache that sat on her lip as quiet as a sleeping cat.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like you, Michael,‚Äù Aoife said to the young man. ‚ÄúA trimmer.‚Äù
The older man, whose name was Eoin, spoke. His voice was a gravelly rumble. ‚ÄúAnother one. They‚Äôre getting careless.‚Äù
They gave Carl a heel of bread and a bottle of water. He devoured it like an animal. As he ate, they told him everything. They called the mustaches ‚ÄòThe Chorus‚Äô. They explained that the mustaches weren't natural. They were a parasite, a symbiont introduced generations ago by a group who called themselves the Founders. The idea was to create perfect social cohesion, to eliminate misunderstanding, argument, and dissent by streamlining communication. Individuality of thought was smoothed over by the mustache‚Äôs innate desire to agree, to find common ground, to keep the chatter pleasant.
‚ÄúThey control us,‚Äù Aoife said, her voice laced with a bitterness that felt ancient. ‚ÄúThey keep us docile. Happy. Busy. You don't question things when your own face tells you everything is grand.‚Äù
The GGA‚Äôs job was to maintain this harmony. Anyone whose mustache malfunctioned‚Äîthe ‚ÄòSilent‚Äô‚Äîor was tampered with, was taken for ‚Äòre-education‚Äô. They were fitted with a new, more compliant mustache and their memories of the incident were wiped clean. Those like Eoin and Aoife, who had managed to remove the parasite entirely, were ‚ÄòBlanks‚Äô. They were hunted. They lived in the shadows, scavenging, hiding, remembering a world they had only read about in forbidden books. A world of real voices.
They began to teach him. In the damp cellar, surrounded by the ghosts of old barrels, they taught Carl how to speak. At first, his vocal cords felt like rusted wires. The sounds he made were hoarse croaks, alien and monstrous to his own ears. Eoin, who had been a history lecturer before he became a Blank, was a patient teacher.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a muscle, son,‚Äù he‚Äôd rasp. ‚ÄúIt remembers. You just have to make it.‚Äù
They had him read aloud from a tattered copy of a book of poems. The words felt like stones in his mouth. Aoife would correct his pronunciation, her focus intense. The young man, Michael, watched with a kind of hopeless envy. His own mustache had been silent for a month after a drunken slip with a razor. He was too afraid to remove it completely. The blonde woman, Maeve, never spoke. Her case was different. She was born with a defective one, a 'Mute'. She communicated with a series of elegant hand gestures.
Days turned into weeks. Carl‚Äôs voice grew stronger, steadier. He learned to form sentences, to ask questions. To say his own name. Carl. The sound of it from his own mouth was a revelation. He was not the confident patter of Seamus. He was this. This hesitant, deeper, real sound. He was becoming a person.
He found a quiet joy in the cellar. He spoke with Aoife about the rain, and the taste of stale bread, and the memories of a life that felt like it belonged to someone else. Her own voice was the only thing he wanted to hear. But outside their damp sanctuary, the world hummed on without them. Michael grew more agitated. He would stare at his reflection in a shard of broken mirror, prodding his dead mustache, his face a mask of misery.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live like this,‚Äù he‚Äôd say, his own voice a choked whisper. ‚ÄúIn the dark. Eating scraps. I just want it to talk again. I just want to be normal.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as normal, son,‚Äù Eoin would say, his voice tired. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just the life you have.‚Äù
One evening, Michael was gone. A cold dread settled in the cellar. Eoin barred the door. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs made his choice,‚Äù he said, his face grim. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll have told them. To get himself back. We have to leave.‚Äù
They had nowhere to go. They waited in the dark, listening. Hours passed. Then they heard it. The heavy thud of boots on the cellar door above. Shouting. Not the modulated tones of the Chorus, but the harsh, real voices of the GGA, barked and angry. The wooden door at the top of the stairs splintered.
Eoin looked at Carl, then at Aoife. He picked up a heavy iron poker from beside a long-dead fireplace. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an old coal chute behind those barrels,‚Äù he rasped. ‚ÄúIt leads out to the lane behind the next street. Go. Now.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not leaving you,‚Äù Aoife said, her voice fierce.
‚ÄúI am an old man with nothing left to lose,‚Äù Eoin said. ‚ÄúYou are not. Go.‚Äù He pushed them towards the back of the room. Heavy footsteps pounded down the stone stairs. Eoin stood before the door to their small room, the poker held like a weapon. A black-uniformed officer appeared in the doorway. Eoin swung. There was a sickening crack, a shout of pain. Then two sharp reports, like a car backfiring. The sounds echoed in the stone chamber. Eoin fell.
Carl didn't wait. He grabbed Aoife‚Äôs hand and pulled her behind the rotting barrels. They found the chute, a square of blackness thick with cobwebs and the smell of ancient soot. He pushed her in first, then scrambled in after her. They half-slid, half-fell down the narrow, dark shaft, the shouts and chaos from the cellar fading above them. They tumbled out into a pile of rubbish in a lane slick with rain, gasping for air, their hearts hammering. They ran. They ran without looking back, the sounds of the city‚Äôs endless, cheerful chatter pressing in on them, obscene and alien.
They ended up in a derelict cottage on the coast, miles from any town. The roof leaked and the wind howled through the gaps in the stone walls, a constant, lonely sound. The sea was a vast expanse of churning grey, stretching to a horizon that promised nothing. They lived on what they could scavenge from the bins in the nearest village and what they could catch from the rock pools when the tide went out.
The world they had left behind might as well have been on another planet. The Chorus did not reach them here. There was only the wind, the sea, and the sound of their own voices. Carl‚Äôs dead mustache withered. One morning, Aoife shaved it off for him with a sharpened shell. The bare skin on his upper lip was shockingly cold in the sea air.
He changed. The fear was always there, a low hum beneath the surface, but the passivity was gone. He learned to mend a roof with driftwood and tarpaulin. He learned the rhythm of the tides. He learned the shape of Aoife‚Äôs silence. He spoke to her every day. His voice, once a source of shame, became a simple tool, like his hands. He used it to say her name, to ask if she was cold, to tell her he had found a seabird‚Äôs egg. Small, true things.
One evening, they sat on the cliff's edge, watching the sun bleed into the cold Atlantic. The light was fading, turning the grey water to a deep, bruised purple. The wind was relentless. Down below, the waves crashed against the black rocks.
‚ÄúDo you ever miss it?‚Äù he asked, his voice nearly lost in the wind. ‚ÄúThe chatter. Never being alone.‚Äù
Aoife stared out at the water for a long time. The wind whipped strands of dark hair across her face.
‚ÄúI was always alone,‚Äù she said, her voice quiet but clear. ‚ÄúI was just never in silence.‚Äù
He understood. He reached out and took her hand. Her fingers were cold, but they curled around his. He looked out at the darkening world. They had lost everything. Their friends, their homes, their city. They were ghosts, haunting the edge of a world that hummed along happily without them. There was no victory. There was only this. The cold wind, the dying light, and a single, true voice to speak into the vast, oncoming night.

Let's set the scene.

For all the DJ chasers this year; I feel like Black Coffee was the big new name. He was supposed to play Tuesday Sunrise on Mayan. But with the rain his set pushed to Wednesday sunset at Mayan. 

This pure troll finished his set with the following:

Toto
Lionel Richie 
Earth wind & fire
Jamiroquai (first I've ever heard on playa)

And a bunch of other beautiful soulfu songs (list any I missed)

Even better he would turn the music to zero and back up between tracks. No mixing, just pure good music. 

He educated that crowd. Many around my group seemed pissed. Or at least that's the vibe I got, while I was dancing in pure soul full bliss. 

On top of that. Mayan thanked him and just turned the car off. I heard from a friend at the airport he left not 14 hours later. A beautiful one and done. 

This was the best example of what the values can do.  Take a hyped DJ and let him do what he wants. Not feel obligated to put on a show. Just give back in his own way.

Thank you Black Coffee for playing what you wanted to play, in your way!

I would love to be friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm shadow\_surf. Imagine if this was my real name. Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

It doesn't matter what your age is or where you're from! Feel free to reach out if you'd like a best friend! :)",0,1757891133.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

My experience + warning to others,"I‚Äôve noticed a pattern every single time I order a Cold Brew at Dunkin‚Äô, and I‚Äôm starting to wonder how many other people are being affected without even realizing it.

Cold Brew is one of the pricier drinks on their menu ‚Äî it costs more than the regular/original coffee. But unless I‚Äôm standing there watching them make it, my order almost always comes out wrong. It‚Äôs watered down, tastes like regular iced coffee, or just isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs advertised as ‚ÄúCold Brew.‚Äù

This hasn‚Äôt just happened at one store. It‚Äôs been the same story at multiple locations. That makes me think it‚Äôs not just an isolated issue but maybe a widespread problem.

Now, I get that for some people this might not seem like a big deal. But for someone like me who‚Äôs a big coffee person, it really does bother me. I‚Äôm paying extra for a product I enjoy and expect to be made right, and it‚Äôs frustrating to feel like I‚Äôm not actually getting what I paid for.

And here‚Äôs the bigger concern: if this is happening to me, how many other customers are paying extra for a Cold Brew but actually getting something closer to a cheaper iced coffee? That‚Äôs not just a mistake ‚Äî it feels like we‚Äôre being overcharged for a product we aren‚Äôt receiving.

So I‚Äôm posting this as a heads up:
	‚Ä¢	If you order Cold Brew at Dunkin‚Äô, pay attention to what you‚Äôre actually being served.
	‚Ä¢	If it doesn‚Äôt taste or look like Cold Brew, you might be getting shortchanged.
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt be afraid to speak up and ask them to fix it ‚Äî you‚Äôre paying more for a reason.

I‚Äôm seriously considering escalating this further because if it‚Äôs happening to one person, it‚Äôs probably happening to thousands. Just wanted to put this out there so people are aware and not getting ripped off.

Has anyone else experienced this?

I'm talking gums, fillers, binders, lecithins.

The older I get, the more sensitive my body is to low quality foods and ingredients, so of course I'm noticing this more, and caring more.

And granted, I prefer dairy. I am blessed to have a biology that is okay with dairy. But I love non-dairy milks all the same. Sometimes I prefer them in my cereal, my coffee, my tea, my smoothies.

I‚Äôve been going to solidcore now for 4 months - just hit 100 classes yesterday. unfortunately I don‚Äôt have many friends who are into this method of work out and I LOVE the thought of having a buddy I can work out with + get  a smoothie or coffee after class. I‚Äôm in the los angeles area and typically take class at pasadena / hollywood but also willing to go to the westside for the girlies!

A little about me: I‚Äôm in my mid 30s and work in the corporate finance sector (engineering manager), LA native who enjoys trying new restaurants and a good yap session. 

let me know if anyone wants to make friends!!",17,1757890889.0,SolidCore,9,1.0,False

At the time I washed it with the funnel and powder inside and so I was able to easily remove the funnel after but it stained the entire base brown and it won't come off. How do you remove the funnel with the wet coffee? my moka is a 1 cup. ",4,1757890840.0,mokapot,5,1.0,False

Ordered a few accessories like a bottomless portafilter and a basket recommended by Tom's Coffee Corner. And I have a K6 grinder. 

I mostly drink light roast Ethiopian filter coffee, or fruity, funky natural process beans. What would you recommend to me that's sold at Whole Foods? I came across the following names so far ‚Äî

- Holler Mtn (Stumptown)
- Hairbender
- Black Cat (Intelligentsia)
- Sermon (Verve)
- Buena Vista (Verve)

My local Whole Foods also carries Sightglass coffee. 

Also, any other beginner friendly advice would be appreciated.


Thanks!

The IRL dream was when the ""original"" plans of RWBY were leaked on Tumblr and it caused a massive shitshow that spread throughout the fandom. I don't remember much, but it involved Ruby being the sole MC, Salem being human, JNPR being the rulers of an Asian-based continent, Ozpin being a shapeshifter etc. Definitively felt too real and it freak me out that when I woke out, I checked Tumblr if the leak was real. Thankfully, it wasn't because I didn't like what I saw and it felt confusing.

The in-universe dream was several RWBY characters (I think it was Salem)  crash into my home and I needed to basically take care of them. My dog was there and kept barking at them. (She's a cute little Maltipoo). I told them to not leave my apartment, but then I got mad and like I threw boiling hot coffee at Salem and the dream ended.

None of these dreams were nice. It was confusion all around. And none of my interactions with RWBY characters were positive. I do think its a manifestation of my anxieties mixed with my hyperfixations. 

How common are fandom related dreams anyways? Do you all have any? ",5,1757890798.0,RWBY,9,0.86,False
