1h9rjut,https://i.redd.it/b27im0p8mo5e1.jpeg,What is the minimum # of days required to work on a 16h contract? ,"I used to work at a branch of a chain of coffee shops and I’m hearing from my ex-colleagues that the operational manager is telling them that their 16h contracts require them to work 3 days minimum, as opposed to 2. 

I worked there for over a year and did so in close collaboration with managers and handled scheduling on occasion, and was never told the minimum days required to work are 3 on a 16h contract. I as well as many others working there did two days a week when the General Manager was in charge of scheduling as opposed to the Operational Manager. 

The number of days is not specified in the contract. Just the hours. The above image is what the contract says in terms of Hours of Work.

Are my ex-colleagues required to work 3 days on a 16h contract? Or is it okay for them to submit unavailabilities for 5/7 days in the week (they have uni classes).

1h9rgjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1h9rgjl/lost_of_love/,Lost of love ,"Josh laid on his bed, still in his school uniform. He wasn't very comfortable and his condition was less than ideal, but he was too tired to change or clean himself, and so there he laid on his bed, repeating the scenario in his head, as if watching a movie. when he got inside, Josh's mother almost fainted. He was covered in dirt and mud from the waist down and the grass stains on his blazer and trousers made it look as though he'd dyed his clothes green. without words, he shamefully ran past her, nearly pushing her over with his shoulder as he left a trail of muddy footprints leading to his door, which slammed shut with such force that he could've sworn he'd felt the whole house shake. Not as much as him, though. He was shaking like an addict suffering withdrawal and, to an extent, that's exactly what he was. He was addicted to that feeling he got when he was with her.

**Get over it** he told himself, although he knew it wasn't that easy. **It was obviously gonna happen at some point, she was way out of your league** he thought in an attempt to console himself, which ultimately failed. ""A-Are you ok in there, Josh?"" His mother asked. He stayed silent. ""Do you want me to come in?"". ""No, thank you"" replied Josh, inexpressively, although this was the opposite of how he truly felt. He wanted consolidation, someone to tell him that it was going to be alright, but he couldn't let her see him like this, so pathetic, so vulnerable. ""Pathetic and vulnerable"" he chuckled, ""that's pretty accurate, isn't it?"" He wasn't sure who he was asking, but before he could think too much about it he was interrupted. ""Did you say something?"" his mother asked. ""Oh-uh, no no I didn't say anything!"" Josh said, quickly trying to regain his composure. ""Oh, ok... well just know I'm here if you need anything, and you can call me if you want to speak, I'll be in the kitchen so I'll be able to hear."" ""Thanks, mum"" he replied, before falling back onto his bed, and into a somber state as he recalled the moments he'd had with her.

She was amazing in every sense of the word, even her name, Azalea. she was on par with models, and she would probably be one if she wanted to, but no, she didn't want to be a model, or anything of the such, **she wanted to be mine, even if just for a while, even if just for laughs, she wanted me, and I wanted her** Josh laughed, loud enough to hide the sobs, but his throat was getting tight and soon enough, there was no laughter, only a croaky voice that resonated across the room. He laid on his stomach, his cries muffled and tears absorbed by the pillows. It was hard to breath, but it was a nice feeling, a struggle with no consequence to succumbing to, you can just turn your head, or roll over, simple solutions. but what about now? It's not like he could make her stay with him, not if she didn't want to. 
**Why is it so complicated?** he thought. What did I do wrong?. Nothing came to mind, no matter how hard he strained his brain, and then it hit him. **Nothing, I didn't do anything, did I. She simply got bored, because of course she did, I'm not rich, I can't take her places she'd like, I'm not important, it doesn't make her popular by being with me, I'm only loving and caring, I can only give her my heart, no traction, no jewelry, just my love, and of course that's not enough, it never is, it never will be, you're gonna need more than that if you wanna keep them, won't you?**

His tone had become bitter, and yet he wanted to savour it. it felt great acknowledging his feelings when no one else woul-no, when no one else could. there were people willing to listen, but he wasn't willing to speak, to share what he was feeling, and this had stood true throughout all of his life. He knew it was stupid, but he didn't want people to see him in the state he laid in now. ""Pathetic"" He mumbled ""I'm pathetic."" He rose from the bed, clenching his fists dense as rock, shaking not in pain, but rather resentment for the pitiful sight he'd let himself become, all because of some girl. **who cares if she doesn't want me?** Josh told himself, although the thought of it still made him teary-eyed. **God dammit, why'd she have to be so perfect, and why did she even ask me anyway if she was just gonna leave me in a few months?** He rubbed his eyes and was surprised to find tears falling down his cheek. He went to the mirror and jumped back at the sight. He was a mess, both mentally and physically.

When Azalea had asked him to speak with her privately, he was thrilled. Their relationship had been slow after the first few weeks, and he thought that she might have wanted to speak to him about progressing, and she did. She wanted to progress. She wanted to move on, and be with someone more ""compatible"", more complementing to her nature, not someone who ""can't meet my needs"". Josh was speechless as he stood there, silent for what must have been a while because Azalea had begun to speak again. ""Look, I know it's not easy to hear, but you're just not my type anymore."" This time, she was met with tears, racing down an empty face, seemingly vacant from the world, as his eyes focused on the stars too far to see, at the other side of reality, where he wished he could be. Away from the crowd of insecurities that gazed down at him from heights he wished he could fall from. But he couldn't. He couldn’t think, he couldn’t speak, he was no longer following his brain’s orders, nor his heart’s requests, but rather his instincts. And his instincts were telling him to run. He ran-through the gatherings of kids, through the gates, across the road and into the forest he went through everyday to get home, and yet now seemed unfamiliar, unknown, much like everything else. Nevertheless, he still ran, over the roots that stuck out on the path and through the puddles formed in the pooling of a depression, much like him.

""That's it."" josh exclaimed quietly, ""I need some fresh air, and some fresh clothes by the looks of it."" He opened his wardrobe and picked out the first clothes he saw. **It's not like it matters, nobody's gonna see me anyway, not in the middle of the woods..** He undressed and almost had a heart attack when he saw himself. The mud from his trousers had sunk through onto his legs and he looked like a swamp monster, with red puffy eyes and cuts all over from the branches he ran through, which he didn't even feel at the time. He immediately jumped into the shower and turned it on, full blast. The water was scalding hot, but somewhat soothing. It reminded him of the time he went to the beach with Azalea and the sand was too hot to stand on, and when he spilled her coffee all over himself when she asked him to hold it. They were fond memories, making them harder to think about. He stood under the searing water, watching the steam rise and feeling tears fall, taking shallow breaths as the temperature became bearable, whilst the pain in his chest got worse. he didn't bother with soap or shampoo, he only rinsed his legs and cleaned the cuts. when he stepped out of the shower, he looked like a different person compared to his former self, except for the puffy red eyes, which seemed to have only grown. He dried himself, put on the fresh clothes and approached his door. He hesitated before grabbing the handle, questioning whether he's ready, but dismissed the thought. He couldn't stay in his room forever, and he needed some time outside anyway. He turned the handle and slowly pushed the door open, trying to make as little sound as he could, to not disturb his mother, although this proved unsuccessful when he heard a voice. ""Are you going somewhere, hun?"" his mother asked. ""yea, I think some fresh air would do me good"" he replied. ""Ok, well take some food with you, you might get hungry."" ""Oh ok, I'll grab something from the cupboard and go."" Josh went to the kitchen and was hit with a smell so strong it almost blew his hair back. ""What's that smell?"" He queried ""It's chicken and rice, do you want some of that instead?"" She asked, grinning ear to ear. ""yes please."" he said, barely concealing his enthusiasm. ""I knew you would, well there's a tub in the fridge, you can take that with you"" ""Thank you"" ""No worries, just don't be gone for TOO long, ok?"" ""ok, mum"" ""Good, now go get some fresh air"" ""Goodbye mum, see you later""

When he stepped outside, it was as though he'd stepped back into the world he was familiar with. The gentle breeze gave him a soothing chill, and the barking dogs gave a sense of nostalgia, as if he'd matured over the past hour, and comparatively, he had. He felt almost new, he felt he could leave all drama in the past and begin again, with no regrets. He proudly advanced towards the forest, uncaring of what people thought about him, after all, why should he be? They don't even know him, and it's unlikely that he'd ever see them again anyway. Hell, he felt he could dance his way to the forest and back, swinging his shirt in circles above his head without a care in the world. He made it to the forest quicker than he expected, and sauntered through the trees, admiring the life that had grown and lived there for generations, through winters and summers, autumns and springs, through rain and storms and countless disasters, and to still be here, unfazed, standing taller than any building we could hope to construct. The thought of this made him further realize how childish he had acted, as though it was the end of his days, when it was merely the beginning. The storm had come early for him, but this only meant a head-start from his peers. To think he was willing to chop himself down to avoid the rain, unaware that its necessary for growth, was a shameful thought, a mindset long forgotten, and rightfully banished from his new perspective.",1,1733688337.0,stories,1,1.0,False

1h9rdgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1h9rdgp/first_experience_at_sunday_liturgy_at_a_greek/,First Experience at (Sunday) Liturgy at a Greek Orthodox Church,"After attending Friday's Liturgy and Saturday Vespers, I decided to go to Sunday's service, starting with Matins. 

  
Admittedly, I arrived late to Matins, which didn't seem like a big deal--most people didn't show up at all. At first, I was concerned that I was underdressed, as three of the four men there were wearing full suits and I was wearing a quarter zip sweater with some slacks. That being said, nobody said anything about it or seemed to even notice that I wasn't dressed up, which I am very happy about because money is super tight right now, and I can't really afford to buy anything better than this.



The Matins service was beautiful, and they actually gave me a packet so that I could follow along. The small choir and the priests have wonderful, strong voices that really authenticate the hymns. Later on in the service, a man that I met at the church on Friday came and stood next to me and began explaining to me what was going on and the history of the traditions. Later, I found out that he had graduated from seminary--but remained a lay person--so he knew what he was talking about, and actually teaches Sunday school for the parish.

  
As the Liturgy started, more people began to funnel in and about half of the seats filled up. The man standing next to me continued to explain what was happening and what I'm supposed to do throughout the experience. He also pointed out the iconography and the story that was being told on the walls; this artwork was absolutely mesmerizing and I couldn't stop looking into the faces of the icons--it felt as though they were staring back at me.



Later on, the Eucharistic Liturgy began and we were singing a lot of wonderful hymns and prayers. What really caught my attention was the trance-like state that the choir was putting me in. I don't know if it was all in my head, but I began feeling some extremely intense sensations and at one point I got a little bit lightheaded. I am pretty sensitive to stimulus, which probably made this sensation more noticeable to me. 

  
At the end of everything, we went up to receive the blessed bread, which is a completely foreign concept to me. I became aware that as people were receiving said bread, they kissed the hand of the priest that they had gotten it from. Please do not take offense to my next statement, because I love and respect the Orthodox tradition; but I did not do this because I did not quite understand why this was occurring, and as someone who is not already Orthodox, it seemed a little odd to me to kiss the hand of a man that I don't know. 

  
After everything was said and done, we had an event called ""coffee hour,"" which is celebrated every Sunday after Liturgy. Everybody gathered in another room and collected food on a long table, followed by fresh cups of coffee. The gymnasium that this is typically continued in was booked by another group, so we had to eat in a small, crowded room. It seemed to me that everybody was talking and mingling with others, but to be fully honest, I was a little bit anxious to talk because I am a Catholic who knew not a single person there, as the man that I was sitting next to had to leave early to teach Sunday school. That being said, I still had to grab some food because it looked phenomenal.

  
Overall, I had a positive experience. I may have felt a little bit underdressed, but there were people who were dressed in tee shirts, so I don't think that it was a very big deal. The Liturgy, icons, and choir were absolutely breathtaking, but I did get a little bit overwhelmed by the chants, as I'm used to less singing and more piano. That being said, the food was great and the people seemed quite friendly and welcoming. I plan on coming back next Sunday and beginning Catechesis as soon as I am able to.",1,1733688104.0,OrthodoxChristianity,0,1.0,False
1h9rddf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/1h9rddf/experiences_with_parents_when_you_get_on_t/,Experiences with parents when you get on T?,"I've known I'm trans for about 6 years(took this long cause of stupid prejudices from the world around me)

Parents have always slightly controlled my life, not directly, like telling me do this or do that, but through their reactions to the things I liked/ wanted to do. (going as deep as regretting my current major and dropping out in the first half of the first semester cause it was influenced by them)

All the things that I've decided to do to pass have been huge no's for them (especially like leg hair??? it's such a weird fixation) always telling me how beautiful I look with long hair, in a dress(for prom) or just whenever I presented feminine overall. And it's been just months of being myself contrasted with playing dress up for their sake followed by cracking under what I truly want and presenting how I actually wanted(this came with me being much better mentally, but who gives a shit) And lately there has been this unrest inside me, That I have to finally take a leap of faith and stop this whole shitshow carousel, cause I've gotten to the point of getting viscerally angry at an ordinary dude waking down the street, spending hours upon hours in my bed doom scrolling reddit or going outside with my friends and basically unable to order myself a coffee without getting god damned dysphoric.

Getting back on track now. I'm 19 , I know trans people that already started their medical transition and that gave me a large slap across the face that I can not keep going on like this. Two therapists that I had before (and told them I am trans) completely brushed it off. 

I switched my therapist like 7 weeks ago and he's the coolest man on this fucking planet. I told him about my best friend who is trans and asked him about his opinion on trans people and he told me that he works with trans people, especially through their transition process. It's very hard for me to talk about the fact that I'm trans since I feel that the person in front of me won't take me seriously, but this man after a 3000 word long message and 40 minutes of discussing straight up asked me what name and pronouns to use. Tomorrow for my next appointment I wanna ask some things about the psychiatrist I'm going to if he's a chill guy with trans people and talk to him about what should I do next.

Right now I basically have all the cards in my hands to start heading towards getting a diagnosis and hrt in the next 6 months if all goes well (decent free healthcare + job), my parents in the end will have nothing to say(no throwing out or stopping support) and I want to just leave copies of the documents on a table and go drink for that night. They'll accept it in the end, but the starting T situation. I'm over the fucking moon at the prospect that I might finally get my hands on some if I play my cards right with the doctors, but the parents. I feel like they still hold some hope that I'll turn out a girl, a straight girl. And the actual physical changes would straight up destroy that ""dream"" they have. 

I whole heartedly want to stop caring, but I'm worried about their reactions to seeing me change into exactly what they have been critising all these fucking years. I'm not even talking about extended family, or my friend's parents, no more grandparents cause that would've been the stick in the coffin.

So the base question after all this fucking yapping. What was your experience like? Especially if your parents are transphobic (but not enough to throw you out over it) I imagine my mom thinking of the time a fortune teller told her she'll have a boy and was thought to be amab in my first ultrasound (she's very spiritual and connecting these types of things and being like ""oh, it was meant to be"" type of bullshit) and my dad who will probably be very confused, angry and then hopefully just see me as his son (he already makes jokes about this, and has been weirdly supportive, but not really? He's a weird man let me tell you)  


Well, thank you for reading all of that shit.

tldr: Motherfucker's worried about his parent's reactions to changes on T (and a whole lot filler for context)

Right on the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant & Bushwick. It is a 3 minute walk to the train station and and a 15 minute commute to the city. I’ve heard this area referred to as “the strip” as there are many bars, restaurants, coffee & bagel shops, and other locally owned stores & businesses. Just down the street is Mr. Kiwi’s where you can find “the best & most affordable fruit in all of Brooklyn.” There is a brand new FoodBazaar that just opened up right around the corner next to the train station with everything you could need. 

Included:
- Primary bedroom with private balcony (Bedroom dimensions are: 10’6” x 7’9”)
-Big closet/storage space with shelving 

- Hardwood floors, double paned windows
-  In-unit washer & dryer 
- Stainless steel appliances 
- Deep sink
- Gas stove/oven
- AC/Heat unit in bedroom 


- Weight-room/Gym
- Elevator & Stairs
- 360° Rooftop access 
- Bike storage room
- Package room with cameras
- Security cameras in hallways

- Built in 2019. Feels modern but also traditional with floor-to-ceiling windows and wood finishes. 

The roommate is a recent graduate from The New School and in his early twenties. He works in customer sales and has a background in film & production. He is fairly quiet and mostly keeps to himself. 

I have been living in this apartment since May and I have to say that I have been really pleased with my stay here. I was dorming in the city before this and it just got to be too expensive and a little overwhelming at times. I was lucky enough to find this place because it’s not too far away at all but far enough to escape some of the congestion from the city.

Asking price is $2000 a month + split utilities (based on usage).

So, this person and I dated when I was 17, he was 18. I had met him at a movie theater I was working at and basically fell in love with the fact he was a marine. Well during our relationship - I found out he was “other than honorably discharged” and he had told me it was because he blew his knees out - which will come into play later. Well throughout our relationship, he constantly used me for money, he would coerce me into smoking and drinking, and get me so intoxicated I couldn’t move. Then proceeded to have sex with me. (I vaguely remember one time I was on the bathroom floor in a hotel and I couldn’t move or talk.. I just remember him on top and inside). Him and his mom were freaking nuts.. they were fighting in the car one day, he threw coffee at her while she was driving, he then grabbed the wheel and jerked it and was screaming that he didn’t care if everyone died. After me screaming in the backseat to take me home because I was terrified - they took me back to their house and essentially made me tell them I wasn’t going to tell anyone before they took me home.  There were so many instances I was verbally, physically, or sexually abused.. I was scared and I know now I should’ve left - but 17 year year old me stayed for around 8 months. My final straw was finding out why he really got discharged. He didn’t blow out his knees - he raped a younger girl after getting back from bootcamp and that’s why he got kicked out. 

That’s probably not the whole story, honestly my memories are extremely patchy and I don’t like to think about it. After we broke up he would stalk me at my job and blow up my phone. Finally he quit after a few months, but every now and then I’d see a random message and block him. I’m 24 now and married with a son. We live around the area where my ex did, so for the first two years of living here I was terrified to go ANYWHERE by myself. I decided to check my message requests today on FB and saw this - and then looked at my instagram and saw the rest.. should I tell him to leave me alone?

1h9r9u1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1h9r9u1/vent_random_guy_confronted_me_for_being_trans_in/,[Vent] Random guy confronted me for being trans in public,"So, something happened yesterday that I’m still kinda processing, and I feel like I need to vent.

Here’s the setup: I’m at this little café, minding my own business and just waiting for my coffee. Apparently, that was the perfect time for some random guy to come up to me and start a conversation. Zero pleasantries—he just opens with, “Can I ask you a personal question?” Every alarm bell in my head is going off, but I just say, “Uh, sure?” because I’m too stunned to do anything else. Literally, his next sentence is, “So, are you, like, trans or something?”

And I’m just standing there, completely caught off guard. People are definitely looking now, but of course, nobody’s stepping in. Part of me wants to just walk away, but I also don’t want to give him the satisfaction of making me uncomfortable. Like, who even does this? What makes someone think it’s okay to ask something like that to a stranger? Eventually, I manage to say, “Yeah, so what?” because what else am I supposed to say? You could see him trying to figure out how to respond, which was honestly kind of satisfying. After a painfully long pause, he just goes, “F**,” and walks off like that was a normal interaction. Really, dude? That’s it?

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve dealt with weird comments before, but this one felt different. Getting singled out in public like that just hit harder than I expected. Usually, I can laugh stuff like this off, but this time it stuck with me. Like, I started replaying it in my head, wondering if there was a better way I could’ve handled it. Later, I realized it wasn’t even about what I said or didn’t say—it’s about how people think they’re entitled to my story. I guess what I’m saying is, being openly trans means you never know when someone’s going to try and make it their business. But hey, I survived, and now I’ve got this awkward little story to share. Life is weird sometimes, huh?

A the start of this year he had a heart attack and found out he was diabetic. He has since changed his diet, and thankfully the diabetes has gone away, but he still remains with a restricted diet. I say this because he used to love gifts with little snacks and sweets and he can't really have those things anymore. 

He has a lot of yankee memorabilia, a million pairs of socks and comfy things of that sort. He says he isn't difficult to shop for, yet here we are haha. 

He used to love a cup of coffee in the morning but since the heart attack he can only have decaf, so I was considering getting a nice decaf coffees gift set? Maybe with some snacks in there but I'm not really sure what goes well with coffee that will fit a diabetic and heart conscious diet?

One thing the world isn't crying out for is more words on one of the most written-about cities.

With that being said, I've never visited a city where I've had to wade through so much information on arrival which is no longer relevant in November 2024. 

Due to how much change has occurred in the past 12 months, even factually correct articles from as recent as 2023 can contain potentially misleading content as the country has undergone so much swift change.

I have no doubt that elements of what I've written here will equally become irrelevant in 12 months time. 

I'll start by debunking some historical misconceptions before diving into a typical review of my two-week stay.

For some context, I am a 34-year-old male from the UK who has been working remotely for the last 4 years and currently on a trip through South America passing through [Bogotá](https://www.holdall.work/destinations/bogota), [Medellín](https://www.holdall.work/destinations/medellin), [Lima](https://www.holdall.work/destinations/lima) and [Santiago](https://www.holdall.work/destinations/santiago) before landing in Buenos Aires.

***tl;dr - Even with current pricing I think it's a fantastic city and will outline out why further down throughout the article.*** 



# 🔎 Nov 2024 Fact Check 

  
***""Buenos Aires is cheap""*** | ❌ Incorrect

The biggest misconception that may still linger, even if you are reading articles from 2023. If planning on eating out heavily, then expect European prices or even higher on more imported day-to-day goods. Eating out aside, day-to-day expenses are still good value by global measures. Lots of other things are still great value in the city, but if you are prioritising cost, you should look elsewhere.



***""It's difficult to get a SUBE card""*** | ❌ Incorrect

This was true in recent years, as there had been a shortage of the cities transport cards due to a lack of the plastics needed to create the card. I had no problems going to the nearest off-licence and getting a card on my first attempt. It's worth asking your Airbnb host who may have a spare which may save some time. 

  
***""Nowhere accepts card""*** | ❌ Incorrect

Card availability is now excellent across the city. Even if you are purchasing a single empanada, bananas from a greengrocer, or buying cans of beer from a man in the street before a football match. Some businesses may offer a 10% discount if you use cash, or charge a small surcharge for card payments. Cash only really needed to top up metro cards or to tip. 

  
***""It's hard to find good coffee""*** | ❌ Incorrect

Historically, coffee had been a drink of secondary status given the population's love of [maté](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat%C3%A9) as their caffeinated beverage of choice. However, the last few years have reportedly seen an explosion in the number of speciality outlets, and you don't have to look too far to find great-quality international beans. Expect prices on the high end for Latin America yet cheaper than what you would find in say London.

  
***""Bring dollars with you to change to pesos""*** | Partially correct 

This advice would continue to make sense for Americans who already have dollars, but I wouldn't recommend making an effort to purchase with the intent of exchanging them on the ground. Collecting money via Western Union was convenient and good value, which I would recommend to anyone visiting from outside the US who may not have readily available access to dollars. 

  
***""Make sure you get the blue-dollar rate""*** | Partially correct

Of course, you always want to get the best value exchange rate where possible but the dramatic stabilisation of the peso by late 2024 means that this difference is nowhere near as significant as it was 12 months ago where you could see significant differences in your purchasing power. The main issue with withdrawing cash from ATMs today is the significant transaction fees you may pay. 

  
***""Restaurant service is poor""*** | Partially correct  
I did see some evidence of this, especially in cheaper, traditional restaurants. Comically, drinks would not appear or the bill would never materialise. In more contemporary or higher-end outlets, it was never a problem.



**""It is a football-mad city""** | ✅ 100% True

There is absolutely no doubt that this is as true as ever in 2024.



# 🏠 Where to stay 

  
I can't recall many cities having such a large number of livable and attractive neighbourhoods as Buenos Aires. Unlike other cities in South America, where only small fractions of the city are viable choices due to safety concerns or a lack of amenities, you have an overwhelming number of options at your disposal.

Most guidance I came across prior suggested staying somewhere in the large expanse that is Palermo, and from what I experienced, that would be sound advice for most people. With that being said, Palermo is enormous.  

  
**Palermo** [**Soho**](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-34.581888,-58.435724&z=13&t=m&hl=en-GB&gl=US&mapclient=embed&q=Palermo%20Hollywood%20Buenos%20Aires%20Argentina) **+** [**Hollywood**](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-34.587373,-58.428162&z=13&t=m&hl=en-GB&gl=US&mapclient=embed&q=Palermo%20Soho%20C1414%20Buenos%20Aires%20Argentina) 

Undeniably, two of the most popular areas for visitors to stay are great, but you don't need to focus your attention solely on them. I actually found more coffee shops and bars I liked just immediately outside of them. Whilst there are a lot of great dining options to be found across both areas, I would imagine for most people with the current prices, they would fall outside what you would usually budget for on a nightly basis. Especially in Hollywood, these felt to me like outlets you may go to on a date or with friends over the weekend, not picking up a quick meal on a Tuesday night after work. Soho has a ton of bars open late into the night, but there's no real need to be right in the thick of it. My suggestion would be that if you find an Airbnb that suits your needs and budget in the area then go for it - but I wouldn't make compromises to be specifically in that area as you find it on the map. 

  
[**Chacarita**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KegSAhCBiYSisKzH9) ✅

A neighbourhood I would strongly recommend and consider for a return visit. Bordering the north-west of Palermo, it offers a slightly more residential atmosphere with an impressive selection of quality coffee shops. The area provides convenient access to the B metro line and you can easily walk to both of the Palermo neighbourhoods mentioned above in 15 mins. 



[**Recoleta**](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-34.584828,-58.396343&z=12&t=m&hl=en-GB&gl=US&mapclient=embed&q=Recoleta%20Buenos%20Aires%20Argentina) ✅

A great option for first-time visitors as it places you equidistant between Palermo and Retiro with both neighbourhoods easily reachable by foot. From what I could gauge on Airbnb, accommodation is slightly more expensive but by no means prohibitive, especially if booking for a month. 



[**Palermo · Las Cañitas**](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=-34.571079,-58.431993&z=15&t=m&hl=en-GB&gl=US&mapclient=embed&cid=5462905418256285904) ✅

I wandered through this area of Palermo several times en route to the parks and felt it to be a particularly endearing neighbourhood. Close to Lago de Regatas, making it an ideal location if you're prioritising places to exercise, as you can avoid having to cross the train tracks and main roads if coming from Soho or Hollywood.

  
[**Microcentro**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TdsBmj8cQZ5gF6dp6) 👎

The downtown, commercial centre of the city. Whilst not a popular area to live in, it would be by far the most viable of its equivalents I visited in South America. In a similar way that you wouldn't stay in the City of London or other central business districts, there's nicer places to base yourself over the weekends. 



[**Vicente López** 👎](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WmrYGkrxkk5UrFvX7)

I actually really liked this area - located 8km north of Palermo, you could viably stay up here and in the neighbouring areas with decent transport connections further south and a large WeWork. If it's your first time to the city, however, realistically too far from where you're likely to want to spend your time and missing some of the more lively ambience found further south. 

  
[**San Telmo**](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-34.62256,-58.370258&z=13&t=m&hl=en-GB&gl=US&mapclient=embed&q=San%20Telmo%20Buenos%20Aires%20Argentina) & [**La Boca**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3cas7Yzi6nxoCsm99)  [👎](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WmrYGkrxkk5UrFvX7)

Fun areas to explore during the day time, but for a number of reasons not places to consider staying. 



# Notes on accommodation in general:

In 2024, there is a rapidly dwindling number of cities across the world where you can find quality apartments at affordable monthly rates on Airbnb. Buenos Aires is one of those remaining places and currently offers even better value than you might find in a city like Bangkok.

Even amidst such economic upheaval, accommodation remains *surprisingly* good value. The city has a huge supply of apartment buildings, and you should be able to find a quality one-bedroom apartment for under £800 a month in an area of your choosing. That price can drop even further if you're willing to stay a little further out of Palermo or Recoleta.

I stayed in an Airbnb in the [QUO Swim](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T258GewkZMhSjAo26) complex in Palermo Hollywood, which was well-managed with a small on-site gym and pool. Expect prices to rise during the peak summer months of January and February, so aim to travel outside those periods to get the most value and selection. 

Compared to other cities in Latin America, air conditioning is commonplace in Buenos Aires and essential during the summer. Unlike neighbouring Santiago, where temperatures drop dramatically in the evenings, even in November it was necessary.



[Palermo Hollywood is one of the many great neighbourhoods in the city to consider when planning your stay. The large tree canopies and cobbled streets are characteristic of many of the surrounding areas. The streets are generally peaceful during the day, with restaurants and bars filling up as the evening goes on.](https://preview.redd.it/ux6e7kn0eo5e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d21881fd168c37e76e480733b592934bb2e7f319)



[The park surrounding Lago de Regatas felt particularly in bloom in late November. The city is home to an enormous variety of foliage, and it’s not uncommon to see exotic, pine, and deciduous trees placed side by side. Worth being in close proximity to if a keen runner. ](https://preview.redd.it/vre1w585eo5e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9986d468f1ab56dc9eca8d64ccb22dec17604653)



[Looking towards Plaza de la República from the 38th floor of the WeWork at Av. Corrientes, the views alone make it a place worth seriously considering for working during your time in the city. By far, it offers the best views of any of their locations—one of the highest viewpoints in the CBD.](https://preview.redd.it/eji6b2edeo5e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d8e7065d14e4d923a0d67412e83164c46651e54)



# 🖥️ Where to work 

  
I currently have a WeWork pass and opted for their site in the CBD at Av. Correnientes. 

The main All Access area is based on the 38th floor, offering some of the best views across the city. Within the top three views from any WeWork I've visited. On the 20th floor, there is a second communal area with the main community bar and a café serving reasonable coffee, sandwiches, and cakes.

The area around the building is ideal to explore during the daytime, with plenty of options for a quick bite to eat for breakfast or lunch.

Somehow ironically for a remote worker I actually enjoy the process of heading into a downtown city centre in the morning for a days work. Something about the hustle and bustle of a busy commercial centre which invigorates me.  If you don't also share that peculiarity then there are loads of great quality options in Palermo. WeWork have another couple of sites but this is by far the best option in terms of location and set up. 

From Palermo it was around a 30 minute commute on the metro which was a pleasant ride each morning if boarding before 7AM. You could usually get a seat and it was well air conditioned. I would usually walk home in the afternoons, back up through Recoleta which would take around 90 minutes to the furthest end of Palermo Hollywood. A safe and entertaining walk. 

If i returned to the city I'd make an effort to be within walking distance to it in the mornings. 



# ⚠️ Safety 

* **Of all the cities I visited in South America, Buenos Aires felt the safest.** There's a huge geographical area that you can explore on foot with the type of freedom you may expect in a European city. There's a high footfall across all the main arterial roads, with people roaming the streets late into the evening, accompanied by a visibly reassuring but not overbearing police presence across much of the city. Like any other major city, phone theft and petty crimes are still a reality of life.
* **There are, of course, areas you should avoid visiting at night.** La Boca is considered an area you should be extra-aware of and avoid at night. You would be best advised to steer away from the neighbourhoods of informal housing north of Retiro, like Villa 31. Assuming that you are staying in Palermo or Recoleta, you are unlikely to wander into such areas inadvertently.
* **The metro and train system felt safe.** You are likely to encounter a varied and colourful selection of characters across the underground and overland trains, often performing, begging, or acting highly intoxicated, but they never appeared threatening or coercive.
* **Keep an eye in your head of what something should cost.** With such an unstable currency, high import costs, and a potential language barrier, it can be next to impossible to have a reference price for how much items should cost. For example, when attempting to purchase a UK plug adaptor in a phone shop in Palermo, I was initially quoted 8,000 pesos. Five minutes later and further down the road, I was able to buy two of the exact same items for under 2,000. Try to get a rough idea of how much something should cost before purchasing to avoid opportunistic retailers.



# 📆 Duration and season 

November felt like an ideal time to visit the city. Most days featured relentless sunshine, with the remainder a mix of heavy clouds and occasional storms. With daytime temperatures consistently in the late 20s, no more was needed than a shirt and T-shirt each day.

The peak summer season, during January and February, brings a marked increase in temperatures and visitor numbers, with many locals leaving for their own vacations. I didn't hear too many people excited about the intensity of the mid-summer heat.

Two weeks really felt like the bare minimum you would need in the city if spending the majority of your time working during the week. I’d have no hesitation recommending booking for a month, especially with the cost of accommodation being particularly favourable for longer stays.



# Food & Drink highlights 

**☕️** [**Jungla Café y plantas**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4SzXLjuRk4JyCgnm6)

The best espresso I had in the city. This speciality coffee shop doubles up as a plant store making it a particularly green environment to enjoy a coffee or top quality pastry. 

  
[**☕️ BLANCA Studio** ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wuU1jeaXjAe7Y39N6)

Even though it is expensive and undeniably somewhat pretentious, this is a must-visit for coffee connoisseurs. Speciality-grade beans are served in a stylish interior with limited seating, accompanied by vinyl jazz records playing in the background. 

  
🍺 [**Strange Brewing**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ras3qMEHJSqEYNex5)

Huge variety of craft beers freshly brewed on site with both indoor and outdoor seating. Great quality bar snacks including tacos and Korean Fried Chicken.



# Summary 

  
**✅ Positives:**

* **I found there to be an energetic and positive ambience in the city.** I loved the atmosphere in Buenos Aires. I found the people incredibly warm and welcoming, and the streets maintained an energetic feel throughout the day and night. While never chaotic like an Asian city, it felt notably more alive than other cities on the continent.

* **The public transportation system is highly effective.** The expansive metro and overground train network make getting across this large city simple. Commuting in the morning was a dramatic improvement over neighbouring Santiago, with significantly lower passenger numbers before 7 AM.
* **One of the safest places in South America.** Being comfortably able to explore a city on foot is a key attraction for any city when considering a longer stay, and Buenos Aires comfortably ticks this box. When comparing with other capitals on the continent, there is little to be concerned about.
* **Beautiful outdoor parks.** The cities parks, especially those bordering Palermo and Recoleta, are impeccably landscaped and the ideal places to soak up the long evening sunsets.
* **A great alternative to the European winter.** If you can time your trip between the Argentine spring and summer, you're likely to be rewarded with idyllic conditions while winter makes its presence felt in the northern hemisphere.
* **A great football culture.** After spending any amount of time in Buenos Aires, it will become apparent that this is a city that loves its football. I was lucky to have a colleague who was able to get some for a reasonable price, but tickets can be hard to come by and can reach several hundreds of dollars. 

[On a match day for Boca Juniors, you'll see the team's blue and yellow colours adorning the city. The area around the stadium in La Boca is an ideal place to soak up the atmosphere as thousands of fans arrive from all over the city. Even if you can't get your hands on a ticket, it's a great area to explore on foot. Pick up a traditional choripán \(Chori\) from one of the many street-side asados and wash it down with an XL fernet and coke. Just remember to leave any other team's shirt safely locked in your apartment.](https://preview.redd.it/3adbndcjeo5e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94679071acedd8b491ccbc2360d7626aa161a064)

  
**❌ Negatives:**

* **An expensive destination to get to.** No matter where you are coming from, it is not a cheap destination to reach. Good value flights to the country are rare, and even if you are already within the region, flights often incur [high international airport taxes](https://www.flightglobal.com/airlines/argentinas-new-travel-tax-angers-airlines/150768.article), significantly increasing costs compared to other nearby countries.
* **There seemed to be many nuances that were exclusive to Argentina.** While these do contribute somewhat to its charm, they also mean there’s a lot to get your head around. What is the blue dollar? How should you acquire pesos? Why am I being asked for my passport number when purchasing eggs in the supermarket? I found it certainly required more engagement with certain elements of bureaucracy than you might encounter elsewhere.
* **A somewhat monotonous grid layout.** Much of the city follows a grid pattern, and with relatively uniform building stock and flat terrain, it lacks some of the more distinctive landscapes found in other cities on the continent, such as Santiago or Medellín.**‍** 
* **Argentinian food was a little hit-and-miss.** The deep-fried [Milanesa](https://blog.winesofargentina.com/es/destacadas/milanesa-argentina/) and thick-crust pizzas didn't resonate with me and at current prices, Argentina's much-renowned steaks are definitely more of a luxury item that you won't be eating every night. On the contrary, empanadas are perfect snacks, [Medialunas](https://cuk-it.com/recetas/medialunas-de-manteca/) are an ideal accompaniment to your morning coffee and there's an enviable selection of domestically produced wines that seem to have escaped the worst of inflation. An honourable mention must also be given to the [Choripan](https://www.grillseeker.com/authentic-choripan-recipe/), which you probably don't want to weave into your daily diet unless seeking to expand your waistline.

  
**💡 Tips:**

* **Poverty is currently at very high levels throughout the country.** The tough austerity measures introduced in an attempt to reinvigorate the national economy have led to poverty rates skyrocketing. [3.4 million Argentinians](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/27/poverty-rate-argentina-milei) were pushed into poverty throughout 2024. If you're staying somewhere like Palermo as a visitor, in reality you’re unlikely to notice it firsthand, aside from perhaps a heightened prevalence of rough sleepers in the metro. But it’s important context to have awareness of as many in the country endure an especially challenging period with an unclear future ahead.
* **A physical Claro SIM was good value for money.** I would recommend going to their large store at [Abasto de Buenos Aires](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LxZhVR7JAVLGs9RE7) which is based in the basement of the shopping centre. 20GB of data for one month can be purchased for £12. In order to get the SIM card you'll need to bring both your passport and specifically a *physical copy* of your *credit card*. Debit cards or contactless were not accepted.
* **Read up on the 'blue dollar'.** You could quite feasibly get away with not engaging with any of the economic nuances of the country, but there's some important context to be gained by being aware of some of the challenges and complexities which the local population encounter on a daily basis. There's far too much for me to cover here but I found [this article](https://worldwisecapital.medium.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-argentinas-blue-dollar-e546f4850ce0) helpful and informative.

* **Be careful with ATM charges.** I visited three ATMs on my first day to gauge withdrawal fees, all of which were charging 10,000 ARS (£8) to withdraw cash. Even though I rejected the transaction and withdrew my card, the account was still charged the fee which was later returned once contested 7 days later. If you are on a tight budget and don't want to run the risk of a similar situation occurring where you do not want to be out of pocket, avoid.
* **I found changing money most effective sending money to myself via Western Union.** Getting your hands on pesos can be a cumbersome task with high ATM fees, low withdrawal limits and poor conversion rates. [Download the Western Union app](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZZGeA4ng8NCYL6J47) and transfer some money to yourself, if you are a new customer you get your first transaction for free (usually £7). You can then go to a store and collect the pesos directly, bring a copy of your passport and the transaction reference. The money was available for collection immediately after completing the transaction. I read reports of some outlets running out of Pesos as the day goes on but as the peso has stabilised somewhat, this doesn't appear to be as urgent anymore. **‍** 
* **Argentina has specific plug sockets.** I wouldn't bother bringing any with you but they will become a priority when you arrive. Most of the little bazaars around Palermo should stock them or you can order them to your house on Rappi. If staying for a longer period I would suggest purchasing a dedicated high voltage USB-C charger for a MacBook as it was often clunky attempting to fit a large MagSafe one into a lot of sockets.
* **Bring everything you need for your trip with you.** With high import taxes and limited availability of certain items, you’re almost always better off buying any major essentials before visiting. This advice applies to much of South America but is particularly relevant given Argentina’s current economic situation.
* **To use the metro you will need a SUBE card.** These can be bought from small off licenses all across the city. You will need cash to top them up in store. It is possible to top them up online using an Android only app, but you may lose the will to live before successfully getting the credits on the card. Currently you can store only under 10,000 pesos on the card so keep some cash on you to top up when required.
* **Google Maps listings were particularly unreliable.** There is almost no point in trying to ascertain what the prices may be in a restaurant as even pictures of menus from 6 months ago will contain dangerously out of date prices. In addition, I found a lot of stores had incorrect opening hours. If planning a trip to any smaller store I'd double check if relying on them for whatever reason. This also extended to the Mitre train lines where departure times failed to align with what the app stated.
* **If looking for a barber I can recommend CAPITÁN BARBERÍA in Retiro.** A men's cut cost 11,000 pesos which felt reasonable given the location and quality of shop. It can be found close to [Plaza General San Martin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZZGeA4ng8NCYL6J47) and reservations can be booked in advance at +54 9 11 2400-4196**.** 
* **Lex Fridman's recent podcast with Javier Milei is worth listening to.** [This two hour discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NLzc9kobDk) is available in both Spanish and English and provides some useful supporting context to help understand the current situation within the country.

I've been a barista for over 8 years, and I've had the chance to work with pretty much every espresso machine out there. Today, I want to share my experience with Breville espresso machines because I keep seeing questions about them on this sub.

I recently invested in a Breville espresso machine for my home setup, and honestly, it's been a game-changer. After testing several models, I can say that the Breville Barista Express stands out as the best overall choice for most people.

Here's why I think it's awesome:
- Built-in grinder (goodbye separate grinder!)
- Digital temperature control
- Pressure gauge that helps you nail the perfect shot
- Steam wand that actually works well (unlike some cheaper machines)

But here's the thing - not everyone needs all these features. If you're just starting out, the Breville Bambino Plus is fantastic too. It's more compact and still makes excellent espresso. I actually recommended this to my sister who has limited counter space, and she loves it.

For those who want to go all out, the Breville Oracle Touch is basically a coffee shop in your kitchen. It's pricey, but it automates everything while still giving you control when you want it.

One thing I've noticed about Breville machines is their consistency. Whether you're making your morning cappuccino or entertaining friends with lattes, these machines deliver reliable results. The build quality is solid too - my first Breville lasted 5 years of daily use before needing any maintenance.

I've found some great deals on Breville machines here: https://athometouch.com/breville

Little pro tips I've learned:
1. Always use filtered water
2. Clean your machine regularly (seriously, it makes a huge difference)
3. Let the machine warm up for at least 10 minutes
4. Invest in good beans (even the best machine can't make bad beans taste good)

What I really appreciate about Breville espresso machines is how they bridge the gap between user-friendliness and professional features. You don't need to be a coffee expert to make great espresso, but there's enough customization to geek out if you want to.

The PID temperature control is a feature I particularly love. It keeps the water temperature stable, which is crucial for consistent shots. Trust me, temperature fluctuation can make your espresso taste completely different from one shot to the next.

If you're considering getting into home espresso, I'd say Breville offers the best value for money in the semi-automatic category. They're not the cheapest, but they're definitely worth the investment if you're serious about your coffee.

**Hello Pioneers!**

I hope you will indulge me for a moment and grant me some goodwill as I will be a a bit negative about some aspects of our favourite game and therefore our beloved development studio. No, I don't like it either.

The subject of Trucks has been brought up before, but rarely in a constructive manner. So I am hoping to spark some useful discussion, and maybe - just maybe - get the attention of our valued friends at Coffee Stain Studios, and show them that this is not just about a redundant, janky mode of transportation, but rather the unnecessary crippling of a unique and interesting way of approaching Satisfactory's gameplay; in particular its **Logistics Puzzle**.

Apologies for the daunting wall of text, and if you decide to stick with me, I thank you for your time - because I'm going to take a lot of it.

# Changing the game

I've been playing Satisfactory since Update 2, and am now on my.. 5th playthrough? In that time I have never looked into Trucks and Tractors beyond trying them out for a bit out of curiosity, because - like many in our community - I found that they never seemed to have anything to offer that trains or belts couldn't. **Until my current playthrough.** The results were completely unexpected.

*I loved them.*

I started to play the game in a completely different way, naturally moving towards decentralized factories. The logistics puzzle that came with building roads and distribution centres; figuring out what items to produce at one location and which to truck in from another. Actually using packagers and having a designated Canister Truck to pick up and re-distribute the empty ones. Embracing Blueprints to build highways - encouraging modular design in other areas as well; creating Cloverleaf Intersections to make sure my Trucks could go whichever direction they had to by only turning to the right.

I'm 335 hours in on this save. That's about half of my total play time, and I am nowhere when it comes to actual game progression. I have so many different kinds of projects to work on now, instead of just looking at a To-Do list of the required items to produce the next Project Assembly parts. what the next PA item needs, that I have not felt overwhelmed or burned-out for a moment - which is something that *has* happened in all of my previous playthroughs.  
**All because I gave Trucks a try.**

But...

# Total Loss

They're broken. *Utterly broken.* In a game that is often and rightfully praised for its polish, QoL features, and generally well thought-out game design, Trucks appear to have been ported from some pre-alpha build, and subsequently forgotten about. I hate to say it, but their current implementation simply falls short.

There are three main issues regarding Trucks/Tractors that together make for a wellspring of frustration in an otherwise smooth gaming experience:

\- **General automated vehicle behaviour**  
In short: saying Trucks are dumb doesn't do them justice, because it implies they think at all. Perfect recordings not being replicated on autopilot; sometimes driving the same path differently than the previous  haul. A line of Trucks all driving at different speeds, either crashing into one-another, or braking to a standstill, and staying put long enough to cause a traffic congestion.

[Truck in front stopped because of the one driving in front of it, causing a congestion](https://preview.redd.it/8xwmob3min5e1.png?width=371&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ce23ef33ddf68c52142df1a23df76e30fa240eb)

Stopping when not needed, or not stopping at all. When at a Station they are rarely able to actually park straight even if you did so perfectly in the recording. Losing track of their next node and spending a minute driving backwards or into a wall. *Many, many more...*

\- **Bugs and jank**  
Trucks defying gravity and leaving the atmosphere. Not being able to make a turn and just going forwards and backwards for a while.  And the most egregious of all: **Bumping into invisible obstacles**. Having this happen at the final stretch of a long recording is extremely discouraging. This leads into the next point:

[Invisible obstacle causing a tragic chain collision.](https://preview.redd.it/2y1qdu2ein5e1.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=e57081bc20cd50ff393efd97e0e17e38e0d69d6c)

\- **Underdeveloped recording mechanics and Lackluster UI**  
The way we have to set up Truck paths is just embarrassing. I've spend hours driving down the same roads over and over, praying not to hit an invisible object right before the finish line and having to redo it all.

Or, having one of my existing trucks driving at a snail's pace in front of me , forcing me to do the same - if it's not just standing still completely, for whatever reason - making me wait.  In which case I will have to come back to the ""Pause Node"" that has been created to manually remove it.  
*In fact, every time I record a new path, I have to slowly walk/drive/fly along the route I have just recorded to remove any unwanted nodes one-by-one. doubling the already large time-investment.*

There is no way to look at your saved paths except from inside a vehicle, which means that if you didn't hide the Path Nodes of a Truck, you will have to find out to which vehicle the Nodes belong, just so you can enter it and use the Record Menu to hide it. God have mercy if you have multiple paths visible at once that intersect, and good luck if you have a lot of vehicles driving around.

I have found that one *must* save every single path, even when you don't expect to have multiple vehicles use it, because that way you can place a new Truck and load the suspected visible path and hide it from there.  
I hope you're using short names, though, because the UI of the path loading menu cuts off the name after a number of characters, so more often than not, I can barely figure out which one I'm looking at. And since I need to keep things organised I label all Paths with (StartpointX)>(EndpointY). Also, please let us name Trucks, or stick a Sign on them or something.

[Also notice the Fuel Usage being incorrect](https://preview.redd.it/y2los8brgn5e1.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1fe32de17339a59bf1d4fafe80541e56b0f6f36)

There are a lot more frustrations than I could fit here, but I believe these are the main ones.

# What can we do?

Ideally they get a full make-over, of course. However, I understand that there are certain priorities, and as an optional gameplay mechanic, Trucks are not likely to get that kind of time- or resource investment.  
But there are some small and hopefully simple things that would go a long way to improve user experience.

For instance: a lot of frustration comes from players lacking the ability to easily editing existing paths. Why not use the existing build/dismantle system to allow us to quickly move, turn, remove and add Path Nodes whenever we want. No pop-up every time you interact with them, and the ability to select multiple at once and from a distance.  
Allow to ""Record from current position"", keeping the nodes behind you, and recording new ones from that point on.  
A dedicated vehicle tab accessible from anywhere, like a tab on the map screen. From here you can track vehicles; see their path and corresponding Stations; see what they carry; show and hide their path nodes; name and re-name Trucks and Stations and view relevant stats and assign and re-assign saved paths at will.

**More substantial changes to vehicle behaviour** to decrease how often they make fools of themselves don't have to be big to be meaningful. Something like a Truck matching the driving speed of the one in front would go a long way. Also, not slamming the brakes but instead slowing down would help alleviate unnecessary congestion.

# My Dream Change

I do have a suggestion that I believe would make the use of Trucks appealing *even if nothing else is changed*.  
Let's call a Truck's complete loop a **Route.** and have a Route consist of segments called **Paths** that the player can record and can string together when creating a new **Route.**  
This will allow the player to record -for instance - a main road as a reusable **Path.** A Path is one-directional. Ideally a Path would end whenever there is an exit or junction. In short, when a Truck has a choice of direction, that's when it takes the next **Path** on its **Route.**

Shown below is a piece of art visualising how this could work in-game.  
*You've just finished a Weapons Factory that (for some reason) requires items located at your Oil Rig.*  
You select a Truck and click ""Set Route"".  
You are presented with the aforementioned ""Vehicle Tab"", with a view of the map and all the Paths you have recorded, named, and labelled. You have them listed on your left, and can hover your mouse over a Path Name and have it light up on the map (Also works in reverse).  
You see that 90% of the journey can be done using existing paths. All that remains is to record the last stretch going from the closest already recorded Path to your new factory. Then you string them all together and voila. No more re-treading old ground.

[An example of 4 Paths strung together to create a route from the Oil Rig to the Weapons Factory. The return trip is not included in this image. I only have so many crayons. ](https://preview.redd.it/06vkbzkg6o5e1.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=c07f79e31a5ff5917b120093ca3822bdf77a8363)

From the way she was talking to people about them, I guessed the miniature bells had to be nodes for some kind of holy ritual- probably one that would channel the Great Bell's retribution and disrupt the bearer's magic. So I ate one.""

""Yes, and with good reason. One of my powers as a Living Archetype is the ability to copy powers from other gods and and use them myself. All I need is to steal just a tiny bit of their divinity. When Chelle did her ritual to activate the bells just now, I was able to metabolize the energy flowing out of the one in my digestive tract and start siphoning divine essence from its source: the Great Bell itself. If you need a visual, imagine getting sprayed with a fire hose, but drinking the water faster than it can hit you.

We legit could not stop talking to each other because our personalities matched so well and because we had so much in common. We were both into things that (where are live) were considered cringe or nerdy interests, so it was nice to at least have each other. We legit got along so well that I was not afraid of being myself with her.

 

It started this summer, we hung out frequently, until her birthday came around. I planned on buying her gift last minute as I was pretty busy, and her best friend asked me if I was willing to participate in a group gift where we would all write a letter to her and combine all those letters together to create a sort of book (it was her 18^(th) birthday so we wanted to do something special). I immediately started writing it, finding time on my work breaks and bus trips to write it. I wrote about 2000 words and I was still going (I’m a professional yapper). I was also invited to a sleepover that I had to say no to because my parents never let me (I asked them and they said no, I did not just assume they would say no. I also was going to a festival in another city with a friend the next week so there is no way they would’ve said yes.) They kept insisting that I should come, that I should sneak out, but I did not want to risk that my parents find out and not let me go to the festival as I had already paid a lot of money for it and had been planning it for months. I was also working the day of it and the next day, but I had cancelled my second shift to come.

 

Then two personal traumatic events happened a few days before her birthday, the second of them on the night of the sleepover. The next day I went to the police office to report it. I was already very depressed from the first one and had cut communication with everyone, not just her. I wanted to process this alone and with the people directly involved in the situation. I stopped going on my phone and honestly it was a good thing, as that was also fueling my depression. I did not have time to finish the letter but I probably should have sent it the way it was, which I forgot to do, but yeah. I know it is very shitty of me to have ghosted them, but I was not in the right state of mind to hang out at the party. I probably should at least have wished her a happy birthday at the very least, and I regret that.

 

But the way they reacted shocked me. Absolutely no empathy. I did not plan on telling them what happened, but I felt forced to as they did not understand where I was coming from. Did not matter to them. She was so mad that I did not buy her a gift or wish her a happy birthday, and when I pointed out that I was inactive for that entire week, she did not care. She said I should’ve logged in to tell her happy birthday. I apologized, but it felt like she thought I did that on purpose the week of her birthday, which I did not.

 

We eventually “made up”, in other words, started hanging out together again, but she would NOT stop mentioning it all the time, even to people who we were hanging out with that did not know the full story. Of course, I couldn’t tell them my own side because it was very personal and just the thought of it made me want to cry, so I would just apologize again, and again, and again. She was never satisfied. I still felt like it was my fault, so I bought her a gift. It was a rare album cd of a “obscure” 90s band that she liked. I had spent days looking at thrift stores for something nice or rare that she would like, as she was very into vintage things and I could not afford to spend hundreds of dollars on ebay or depop for those things. I gave it to her and she was so happy at first, saying she did not even think I would remember that she liked the band, but immediately forgot about it and started calling me out again.

 

When my birthday came around the corner, she wished me happy birthday later during the day after everyone started posting their birthday stories for me. She apologized saying she forgot and I said that it was fine and that I did not care. She then said she wanted to take me out to a café and buy me coffee, and I said yes. Only problem is that she ended up never being available, and it was understandable as it was around our midterms. Except that she would say “oh I’m sorry I could not buy you coffee but you never bought me a gift anyways.” And when I would correct her saying I bought her a gift, she would change it to “oh I’m sorry I could not buy you coffee but you never wished me happy birthday.” And when I corrected her again saying that I did wish her a happy birthday she would say that it didn’t count because it was too late, which is understandable, but if you cared so much why don’t you just stop being friends with me?

 

Recently, she started sort of ignoring me. If our conversations are not her complaining about how she is failing all her courses because she cannot stop her social media addiction, or me giving her the resources I make to study or helping her out with her projects, she will ignore me. I try to help her, showing her how I got rid of all social media (except reddit and distraction free Instagram), but she will just judge me saying I’m doing too much. I can’t tell her about how I’m finally able to get good grades or manage my time better, because it makes her feel guilty about her habits she does not plan on fixing. If I tell her about an interest of mine that she does not care about, she will leave me on delivered or seen. If I ask her to read my essay and give me feedback (which we need to do in our course) she will leave me on delivered or seen. If SHE asks me to read her essay to give her feedback, I will do it, but she won’t reciprocate it. If I give her a quizlet I made for a quiz, she will thank me and study it, but if I ask if it helped her in the quiz, she will leave me on seen or delivered. If I ask her to study with me, she will say she needs to lock in then go hang out with the worst people to study with. I cannot get to her unless I am doing her a service.

 

Additionally, she started going on super ableist rants about her autistic friends who she criticizes for doing things that she never set boundaries for. As an autistic person, I tell her that she needs to tell her explicitly what she like and what she does not, but it’s like she expects her autistic friend to just know her preferences because they are “the social norm”. As an autistic person, it really hurts me to see other people be ableist towards other autistic people for unintentional things that could easily be solved with a bit of communication.

 

Today, I could not take the disrespect so I blocked her. I feel like she developed secret animosity towards me before the birthday bit and was trying to get rid of me, but now that she needs me for school things, she just keeps me around to use me. I hate it. Should I have talked about it with her before blocking her? I was scared that she would just ignore me once again. :( I'm sad that I lost that friendship, as it brought me so much comfort.

 

TL; DR: My friend that I got along with very well started being mean and passive aggressive to me after I could not wish her a happy birthday due to traumatic events happening to me. We made up but she keeps mentioning it. Recently started ignoring me unless she needs me to do her a service. Also is lowkey ableist. I eventually blocked her, and need advice about the situation.",1,1733685696.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

They is this morning I saw her in their training room and near the coffee spot. And I can't let my eyes cross over her. She is so beautiful to me. She is having this divine glow on her face. I fell in love at my first sight. Her smile, her eyes and hair, I can't cross my eyes over her. After that, I came to my room and I had been thinking all about her all the time in the weekend. Even I close my eyes, all I see is her eyes, hair and smile. I am unable to sleep, cause all I see is her in the dark side of my eyes

What should I do? Do I have to talk to her? Or just love her from the long? She is always with her friends? How can I start talking to her? How to start conversation with her ?

I had a worst past in my life before, there is one girls during my college I loved but she doesn't. She said she is not interested in love but at the end of college, she found someone. It's okay for me, cause everyone has their own interests and opinions.

I'm not ready to be in the past, I cannot handle same past. I sometimes feel that "" Im not ready to be in love and I'm not seeing myself loving someone and I'm afraid that the same itself repeats. I was there in so much drama before and I'm not ready to be there drama anymore""

Context: we met each other in college as we were in the same friend group since freshman year. I always thought she was cool and pretty cute but we didn’t know each other well. Then during our sophomore year we became super close very quickly. We had a few classes together so we walked to & from class together, started to talk & text a whole lot, studied together, and even started to hang out a lot just us two. We’d watch movies or shows together, grab coffees, have lunch or dinner together at the cafeteria, etc. We’d also go off on our own a lot at parties and dance together or just go on side adventures. She quickly became one of my best friends but I also developed romantic feelings for her and wasn’t sure if what we had was just a close friendship.

This continued into junior year and she became more flirty and touchy with me. She told me she never felt so comfortable around a guy before and really just loved hanging out with me. We went off on our own at a party one night and she got a bit too drunk so I was taking care of her until her roommates came. She put her head in my lap and had me stroking her hair and stuff and at this point I was seriously questioning what we were. Even when her roommates came to bring her back to her dorm, she still wanted me to stay with her so I did the whole night to make sure she was okay. After this, I just had to ask her if there was something more between us especially since all our friends thought so. She said not really and that she doesn’t want a relationship. So, that made things a bit weird between us for a bit but we eventually moved past it and were still friends, though not as close and we didn’t really hang out much anymore.

Fast forward to now, she’s at school still while I’m at home working so we’re away from each other. But we’ve become close again. We ft every now and then for a few hours each time and whenever she’s home we hang out (we don’t live too far from each other). i.e. we hung out over thanksgiving break and it was a great time. And she kept saying how she’ll be home again in a few weeks for break so we have to meet up again.

So my dilemma is that I’m really happy we’re so close again because she is one of my best friends. But at the same time we’re such close friends again that it begins to blur the lines sometimes. I’m almost positive we’re just really good friends but she gives mixed signals. I need some advice - what do you all think? Is she into me at all or are we just really close friends?

Yes, there is hope with Journey by MV- but that's 10k sessions.

There is no trustworthy display ad service to fill in the gap when you are just starting out (please- I have tried Ezoic, Pop Ads, Adsterra, Infolinks, Monetag, PropellorAds etc., And HATED them. The user experience went down the drain really fast, really quick, and paid pennies). 

So, for the ones out there who are looking to stay motivated and keep working towards that initial 10k session goal, here are a few alternatives:

* **Amazon affiliates** (and its equivalents)- Yes, I know what you're going to say- everyone knows this one, but I bet you are not doing it the same way I am- In addition to adding affiliate links within the text, I add them to my interactive images and embed them on my site using Interactivity Studio. Kind of like [this](https://interactivity.studio/ugc/teamslicpix6922/minimalist-workspace-setup-with-pink-background) one (not my image btw just an example). Clicking on the item in the image takes the visitor directly to the product page on Amazon. It is a non-intrusive way of placing affiliate links imo.
* **StuffToSponsor (dot) com**\- Submit your site to be listed in a directory with rates set by you for anyone looking to sponsor/ place direct ads on your site. The platform is relatively new but I think it might grow bigger in the future so perhaps a good time to get listed.
* **Services**\- Offer services to your site visitors that you can fulfill. Adding a 'book a consultation' or 'get quote' page could bring in more revenue than ads will ever do- as long as it is a type of service that you will *actually* be able to fulfill though. I have observed that offering services directly from your site can also help improve your EEAT, which ultimately will benefit your blog in the long run.
* **Gumroad** (and its equivalents)- Create a digital product that is relevant to your niche and give your site visitors the opportunity to purchase the product through Gumroad- or really any other platform. I use Gumroad mainly since they are a Merchant of Record (MoR) and I won't have to deal with taxes but yes they do take a hefty 10%, unlike other MoRs like Lemon squeezy- but entirely up to you.
* **Ko-fi** (and its equivalents- like Buy Me A Coffee)- You could start collecting donations and tips from your site visitors. You never know what might happen and it is better to have one than not.
* **Travelpayouts**\- If you have a blog in the travel niche, there are more than two dozen different affiliate programs you can join through Travelpayouts. Be careful though- adding too many embeds of affiliate code on your site could potentially slow down the site.
* **Member-only content**\- Add a paywall to some of your content and ask visitors to subscribe. If users see value in your blog, and keep returning, they are likely to convert and support your growth. If your blog is on Ghost (dot) org, you can set this up easily. Otherwise, I've used Patreon without any issues.
* **Hydro online**\- Just kidding- would never even dream of using it after reading horror stories all over the place. Had to add it for the jokes though, otherwise there is definitely someone from their marketing team who is going to spam the comments.

\---

That's what I got so far- I constantly get the feeling like I'm missing something, but if I remember, I might come back and add to the list! Please add some useful ones in the comments if your blog earns from a revenue source not listed above!

Also, for the ones who have sites that are hitting 10k+ sessions, still not a bad idea to diversify your revenue. One must always be prepared if there is a sudden decrease in one of the sources of revenue.

Imagine stepping up to a sleek machine, punching a few buttons, and walking away with Bitcoin loaded into your digital wallet. Sounds like something out of a sci-fi flick, right? Well, welcome to the very real and growing world of **Bitcoin ATMs**! These financial game-changers are popping up faster than coffee shops, and if you’ve ever used one, you’ll know just how convenient they are. But do you know what makes them tick? Spoiler alert: It involves QR codes, and that’s where our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** ([https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)) steps in to steal the show.

Let’s dive into this magical combination of Bitcoin ATMs and QR code wizardry, and see why they’re the ultimate duo in your crypto journey!

# What Exactly is a Bitcoin ATM?

For the uninitiated, a Bitcoin ATM (or BATM if you like sounding extra cool) is a machine that lets you buy Bitcoin with cash or sell Bitcoin for cash. Think of it as your gateway to the crypto universe, tucked neatly into your local convenience store or shopping mall.

Unlike regular ATMs that connect to your bank, Bitcoin ATMs are tied to the blockchain. That means they’re open for business 24/7 and don’t care if it’s a public holiday. Need some Bitcoin at 2 AM because your favorite crypto influencer just made a wild prediction? The Bitcoin ATM is your savior.

# Why Bitcoin ATMs are Taking Over the World

# 1. They’re Incredibly Convenient

Bitcoin ATMs are the easiest way to get your hands on some Bitcoin. No lengthy sign-ups, no waiting for bank transfers to clear—just cash in, Bitcoin out.

# 2. They Bring Crypto to the Masses

Not everyone is tech-savvy or comfortable navigating online crypto exchanges. Bitcoin ATMs simplify the process, making cryptocurrency accessible to just about anyone.

# 3. Privacy? Yes, Please.

While regulations vary, many Bitcoin ATMs allow small transactions with minimal identification, making them a hit for privacy-conscious users.

# 4. A Growing Global Network

From Tokyo to Toronto, Bitcoin ATMs are popping up everywhere. As of now, there are over 40,000 Bitcoin ATMs worldwide, and that number is only climbing.

# The Role of QR Codes in Bitcoin ATMs

Here’s the thing about Bitcoin ATMs—they wouldn’t be nearly as user-friendly without QR codes. Think of QR codes as the matchmaker between your Bitcoin wallet and the ATM.

When you step up to a Bitcoin ATM to buy or sell Bitcoin, you’ll need to scan your wallet’s QR code. This code ensures that the Bitcoin you’re buying or selling goes to or from the correct address. Without QR codes, you’d be manually typing out wallet addresses—a surefire recipe for frustration and mistakes.

# Enter the Bitcoin QR Code Maker App

Now that we’ve established the superstar role of QR codes in Bitcoin ATMs, let’s talk about how our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** ([https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)) takes this convenience to the next level.

# What Does the App Do?

Our app lets you generate Bitcoin QR codes in seconds. Whether you’re a casual user buying Bitcoin at an ATM or a business owner setting up a crypto-friendly establishment, this app is your go-to tool.

# Why It’s Awesome:

2. **Customizable for Businesses** Add logos, colors, or custom branding to your QR codes. Who says functionality can’t be stylish?
3. **Error-Free Transactions** Eliminate the risk of typos in wallet addresses. With QR codes, what you see is what you get—no surprises.
4. **Completely Free** Why pay for QR code generation when you can get it for free? Our app is fast, reliable, and doesn’t cost a thing.

# How Bitcoin ATMs and Our QR Code Maker App Work Together

# Scenario 1: The Casual User

# Scenario 2: The Traveler’s Best Friend

You’re abroad and need local currency. You sell some Bitcoin at a nearby ATM, scanning the QR code from your wallet app. Thanks to our QR code maker, the transaction is seamless, and you’re off exploring with cash in hand.

# Scenario 3: The Business Owner

You own a Bitcoin ATM and want to make it as user-friendly as possible. Using our app, you create custom QR codes for instructions, troubleshooting, or even promotions. Your customers love the smooth experience, and you love the increased foot traffic.

# Fun Facts About Bitcoin ATMs

1. **The First Bitcoin ATM** The world’s first Bitcoin ATM was installed in a Vancouver coffee shop in 2013. Talk about a trailblazer!
2. **Fees Can Vary** Transaction fees at Bitcoin ATMs typically range from 5% to 10%. While higher than online exchanges, the convenience is worth it for many users.
3. **Beyond Bitcoin** Many Bitcoin ATMs now support multiple cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, and even Dogecoin.
4. **They’re Getting Smarter** With advancements in technology, Bitcoin ATMs are becoming faster and more secure, solidifying their place in the financial ecosystem.

# The Future of Bitcoin ATMs and QR Codes

Bitcoin ATMs are more than just a trend—they’re a glimpse into the future of decentralized finance. As they become more widespread, the demand for reliable QR code tools will grow. That’s where our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** shines.

By simplifying the process of creating wallet QR codes, our app ensures that everyone—from casual users to business owners—can interact with Bitcoin ATMs without a hitch.

# Conclusion: The Perfect Partnership

So go ahead, find a Bitcoin ATM near you, generate that QR code, and experience the magic for yourself. The future of finance is here, and it’s never been this much fun! 🚀",1,1733684886.0,BitcoinQR,0,1.0,False

English is not my first language so please bear it with me. This might sound like a rant but i am just trying to give every details to be fair. 

i just moved in with my boyfriend few months ago. He owns the house but his friend lives with him. His friend pays rent (helps with mortgage) and bills. I am currently a university student (no current part time job as i just moved in to this country as well but i am looking). 

When i first moved in, i noticed couple of messes here and there. The friend does online business so whenever he gets orders he would put the ‘about to dispatch parcels’ in a pile on the stairs. He would invite his friend over for drinks and usually after a piss up they would just leave the glasses and cups in the sink, cans and bottles on the kitchen table. He also has a dog. i’d say barely kept since as far as i can recall he has never taken her to a vet/groomer. I remember him getting mad at the dog for biting her nail but honestly ive never seen them getting trimmed. Either way, his dog would create a mess as well. He had also put a glass of moulded beer/wine on two different occasions in the sink. Luckily it was my boyfriend who was doing the dishes (on both occasions) so he had to deal with it not me hihi. All and all, even after those, i would just clean it up whenever ive got the time. I would also cook because that is my coping mechanism and would prefer to say i am better at it as compared to the other two. 

However, last week, i was bombarded with assignments. That and occasionally missing friends and family back home. It’s also good to note i commute to uni everyday (half an hour walk from/to train station, another half on the train and then 15 mins to campus). I cleaned the house every friday cause that is my day off uni. I was so tired from going out and about on saturday and on Sunday i finally got my chill time. I admit that i had left a glass of water and a bottle of drink in the living room and did not clean it up afterwards. Monday, after i left at 9 am came back at about 6pm, we all decided to watch some film and after it ended i got tired again and admittedly i left a bag of crisp in the living room as well. Tuesday was roughly the same time of coming and leaving except i came a little later (about 7pm i think). Wednesday when i got home at about 1, i cooked some lunch before getting an idea of doing the dishes while i waiting for my hair to process (i thought about dying it at home). I immediately went upstairs to get started, but realised that the stuffs i got might not be enough. Then amazon declined my bank, and i had to sign up for another local bank instead. I was caught up with it until the friend came home (earlier than i expected). 

Before i got the chance to come downstairs and let him know i’ll be taking care of the dishes, i overheard him berating me to his mate who happened to be there. The thing is, the blame was put all on me even though there was some other dirty dishes from the night before (friend and his mate had a piss up) and breakfast (boyfriend had his cereal and a cup of coffee). There was also a pile of clothes (jackets and hoodies) of bf’s and mine but again that was blamed on me. Not only that, bf had also been home before him (he knew bcs he saw it from the front door camera). But i was the one who was blamed. 

We had a little argument and he said that after his long shift he just wanted to come home to a clean tidy house to which i was like ‘everyone wants that, everyone has had a long shift’. Point is i dont understand why he’s complaining about picking up after my mess when i have been doing so the moment i moved in. After he left i cried to my boyfriend because i was upset for carrying the blame when i feel like i shouldn’t have. Bf had a word with him to which he then kept yelling and shouting (his mate was in the next room, i was upstairs). He claimed the kitchen to be his, and that i was a pain in the arse. In al honesty it hurt me a little. 

We did have a meeting the next day about what happened. It was my boyfriend who called the meeting; initial point of meeting is to lay out the pet peeves we’ve got on each other. However i used the event to defend myself. He did apologise for badmouthing me but not to the fact that he blamed me for all of the mess even though i was not the one who solely contributed to it. I feel like it is unfair. Now i dont even feel comfortable walking around the house especially when he is around because it makes me feel like i am not actually welcomed and that none of my effort appreciated. 

I feel like moving out since i dont think i have the rights to make him move out. i know it will hurt my boyfriend’s feelings which i really want to avoid but i cant just keep living in fear like this. Everytime i overhear this guy says my name i get anxious. Aimta for leaving the mess? Aimta for wanting to move out? Should i even move out?",1,1733684785.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Key takeaways so far are I feel SO much healthier! I’m able to go to the gym after work now where before I’d get home, eat and not be able to get off the couch. The sustained energy I have is drastic. I’ve noticed that caffeine hits harder now too. Before a cup of coffee or an energy drink would give me only the smallest amount of energy or motivation. Now they really give me a boost! I’m doing less caffeine but getting more out of it.

My workouts have much improved and because I can actually eat now without getting nauseous I’ve been gaining weight and getting stronger. My strength had really dropped off since I started using Zyn’s. They were making me so weak. I didn’t realize this until I quit.

Knowing this has made the cravings easier for me to overcome. It hasn’t been easy but it hasn’t been all that hard either. I smoked cigarettes for 5 years and quit for a year before starting Zyn (stupid, I know!) and cigs were much harder to quit in my experience.

1h9psdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumesindia/comments/1h9psdk/beginners_guide_to_networking_what_it_is_why_its/,"Beginner's Guide to Networking: What It Is, Why It’s Important, and How to Get Started (Updated for 2024)","**Hey Reddit,**

Every day, countless job seekers send out dozens, even hundreds, of applications without hearing back. If this sounds like you, it’s time to take a closer look at **networking**—a powerful tool that can significantly improve your job search. With an average job posting receiving over 100 applications in 2024, simply applying online might not cut it anymore.

Let’s dive into networking: what it is, why it matters, and how you can leverage it to land your next job.

# What is Networking?

Networking is the process of building and maintaining professional relationships that provide mutual value. It’s not just about meeting people—it’s about creating genuine connections with individuals in your field, exchanging knowledge, and offering support.

# Why is Networking Important?

In India and globally, a significant number of job openings are never advertised and are filled through personal connections or referrals. Networking is a way to tap into this hidden job market and stand out from the crowd.

* **It’s not just for extroverts:** Networking is about building meaningful, reciprocal relationships, not using others for your benefit.
* **It’s a long-term investment:** Networking isn’t only about finding jobs but staying updated with industry trends, finding mentors, and exploring career development opportunities.

# Benefits of Networking Beyond Job Searching

1. **Stay updated on industry trends** and gain access to opportunities that aren’t publicly advertised.
2. **Find mentors** who can guide you in your career decisions.
3. **Learn about new skills and certifications** to stay competitive in your field.

# Networking in Action: An Example

Aditi, a software engineer from Bengaluru, attended a local tech meetup and connected with a hiring manager from her dream company. This led to a coffee chat, where she showcased her skills and interest. Within weeks, Aditi received an interview invitation and landed her new role. Networking at its finest!

# How to Network: Methods to Consider

1. **Events:** Attend industry-specific meetups, conferences, or job fairs. Examples include tech hackathons, marketing summits, and alumni events.
2. **Informational Interviews:** Schedule casual conversations with professionals in your field to learn about their career paths and seek advice.
3. **LinkedIn:** Use LinkedIn to connect with peers, follow industry groups, and message hiring managers or alumni from your college.
4. **Online Communities:** Engage in forums, subreddits (like this one!), or Slack groups related to your industry.
5. **Social Media:** Twitter and even Instagram can be great for following thought leaders and joining conversations.

# Where to Start?

Start small and set a goal:

* Are you looking for a job immediately?
* Do you want a mentor?
* Or are you building connections for long-term growth?

Begin with your **close network** and expand outward:

1. Family and friends.
2. Past colleagues or professors.
3. Alumni networks or LinkedIn connections.

# Professional Organizations in India

If you’re running out of connections, join professional organizations relevant to your field:

* **Technology:** NASSCOM, ACM India Chapter.
* **Marketing:** Indian Society of Advertisers, DMA Asia.
* **Finance:** ICAI (Chartered Accountants), CFA India Society.
* **Healthcare:** Indian Medical Association (IMA).
* **Engineering:** Institution of Engineers (India).

# Common Networking Challenges and Solutions

1. **Fear of rejection:** Start with people you know or online networking to ease into it.
2. **Introversion:** Focus on written communication (LinkedIn, emails) instead of live events.
3. **Lack of time:** Dedicate 1-2 hours weekly to building high-value connections.
4. **Slow results:** Networking is a long-term game; be patient and persistent.

# Maintaining Your Network

Networking isn’t a one-time activity. You need to nurture and maintain your connections. Categorize your network into tiers:

* **Tier 1:** High-value connections like mentors or hiring managers.
* **Tier 2:** Industry peers or former colleagues.
* **Tier 3:** Broader acquaintances in your professional circle.

Interact with them regularly, whether through LinkedIn comments, messages, or coffee chats.

# Practice Your Elevator Pitch

Prepare a 60-second introduction that includes:

* Who you are.
* Your background.
* Your career goals.

For example:  
""Hi, I’m Priya, a recent graduate in Data Science from IIT Bombay. I’ve worked on multiple machine learning projects and am passionate about applying AI to healthcare solutions. I’m currently looking for opportunities to contribute to innovative teams in the health tech space.""

# Final Thoughts

Networking might seem daunting, but it’s one of the most valuable career skills you can develop. Start small, be authentic, and remember—it’s not just about getting what you want but also helping others along the way.

Happy networking, and good luck!

My husband (33m) and I (32f) have been married for 7 years. We have 2 children. 
I thought he was the love of my life. Everyone I know told me from the moment I married him that I could do better than him, but I didn't care. My heart chose him. For nearly 6 years, we had the perfect relationship. He was my best friend, the person I could truly be my entire self around, and it felt amazing. We had intense love. 
I have a sister (30f) who I am very close with. We regularly get together and hangout, we talk every day about everything.

 A guy, we will call him S (29m) knows us both. We met him before I was married on a night out when we were much younger. S fell in love with me straight away, I friendzoned him hard, but he never gave up. I was always straightforward with him, and he never pushed it too far but would make jokes constantly about how I was perfect, how he would wear me down and marry me one day, etc. He was such a nice guy, but he just didn't do it for me. He would regularly ask to hang out one on one and I would always politely decline. He would try to come up with excuses to see me, and at some points, it felt kind of stalkerish. He would offer to do everything and anything I asked, but I always declined because it just felt like i was taking advantage of him. Even when he had a girlfriend, he would still try to initiate concersation and it was always clear he wanted to be more than friends. I simply never had any feelings for him and didn't want to pursue anything, I was honest with him, but he still didn't give up until I was married. Once I got married, S started doing all the same things to my sister, saying all the same things and trying all the same moves. She would tell me about them, and we would regularly laugh together at how crazy and pretty creepy this guy could be. He would say we are the perfect humans, and he would do anything on earth for us, etc. He even said to my sister ""Your sister is out of the picture now, so you're my fall back because you're the closest thing to her I'll ever have, but you're perfect in different ways"". She would try to cut him off, but he would turn up at her house with a coffee and try for a conversation, just like he used to do with me. 

A year ago both our parents died in a car accident. We were in total shock. I knew I had to be strong for my sister, myself, and my children. My husband was seemingly unphased by the loss of my parents (I suspect he never liked them much). 
About 6 months after they died, I realised I needed help. I hadn't grieved and took the responsibility of caring for everyone else's needs too seriously and was really losing myself, I suspected I was falling into depression. Planning the funeral, handling the estate etc took its toll, our children are both so young and take up all of my time and energy, and I still try to work and study at night while they sleep. I started seeing a therapist, and things started feeling better for me, but that's when I noticed the dynamic of my relationship with my husband had completely changed. He no longer told me he loved me first, I always told him. He no longer initiated physical contact. It was always me. We never stopped being intimate 3-4 times a week, but all other connections failed. I kicked myself for not realising he was slipping away while I was working on myself. 

 I started trying to work on my relationship the moment I realised something was wrong, but it didn't seem to matter what I did. It felt like he didn't even care. I noticed he was paying more and more attention to his phone, and it felt like he was hiding something. One day, I had had enough and asked him if I could see his phone. He told me no, which was insane to me because 1. I'd never asked to see his phone before and 2. what on earth could he be hiding? 

My sister and I did some detective work and discovered he had started a friendship with some new woman (24f) from work. There's a lot of backstory to how I figured it out, but I'll skip all that. I never stopped him from being friends with any woman, but I was surprised he hadn't even mentioned this one's name before. This opened an entire can of worms.

I tried and tried and failed to reach out to my husband about this, when I would ask anything he would compeletey shut down, gaslight me, tell me I was crazy, it was all in my head etc. He would say he loves me, and I'm his soulmate, and my depression was causing paranoia. I was so confused because all signs pointed towards an affair, at least an emotional one. 

Eventually, I got the courage to confront the woman. She was genuinely shocked. She said she didn't even know he was married. She said he was a pest, to say the least. She believed he had a fascination with her, and while she liked the attention, she was in no way attracted to my husband. He would offer to do things for her, like fix her car, take her places, do her shopping, buy her gifts etc and she took full advantage of it, because why not? She was young and had guys falling all over her, just like I used to. As we spoke more and formed some sort of weird friendship, she explained to me that he was exactly like the S guy who used to never leave me alone. It made me feel so sick. We laughed together about it, but inside, I just felt destroyed. 

When I confronted my husband, I asked the woman to help. She did, and I think we humiliated him on a catastrophic level. I thought he'd admit everything, I already knew everything anyway, I'd seen the messages, all his attempts to talk to her, ask her for coffee, spark up conversation with things he discovered they had in common and I read her replies, which were friendly at best, like she was letting him down every time. Instead of coming clean, he just said we were both crazy and he never mentioned her because it wasn't important. She was just a random girl from work. That they were just friends and nothing more. But I'd already seen nearly 6 months' worth of conversations where he was clearly trying to hit on her, ask her out, or at the very least sleep with her. He did favours for her, hung out with her in person a few times, and I had no idea about any of it. 

She apologised for not just straight up telling him to get lost, but like me and S, she felt bad for the guy and saw him as just a friend. 

My husband was so embarrassed after all of this that he stopped talking to her all together. He started reinvesting his time and energy into our relationship. It took me 6 more months to get him to talk about it. Last week, he finally admitted he was trying to cheat. His excuse for trying to cheat was that I was unemotionally available and pushed him to seek comfort from another woman. He said he didn't love her or even like her. He just knew she was easy and hoped it would lead to more. He knows it was wrong and has spent every minute of every day since, showing me how much our relationship means to him. We have 2 children, and walking away just wasn't an option for us at the time. Over something he said was just a friendship.

Fast forward to now, and I can't look at my husband without thinking about S. Without thinking about how pathetic he was for trying again and again with a woman who had friendzoned him. Without wondering what would have happened if the woman he picked didn't  put him in the same basket I put S. It makes me feel sick to my stomach, and I can't even look at him anymore. It just feels like he's a  bit of a creep now. 

He's begging me to help him fix our relationship. He says he made a mistake (to me, it was more than a mistake). I wonder where we would be if this woman wanted him.. 

I'm so lost on what I should do. ",7,1733683874.0,Marriage,24,0.89,False

It’s Sunday and I feel . . . honestly, fine? Important context, I am 32, moderately fit and healthy with a high pain tolerance and a hyper-independence streak . . . This was easier than getting my wisdom teeth removed. I’ll put down some highlights and try to keep it concise!

**Timeline**

* Aug 27 - Initial Consult
* Sep 17 - Follow-up and Pelvic Exam
* Oct 1 - Telehealth Appt to schedule Surgery
* Dec 6 - Surgery (earliest available slot)

**Surgery Highlights:**

Arrived at 6am and was taken back for pre-op and was in the OR by 7:33am. Every single person I met was an ABSOLUTE DELIGHT. Seriously, 6am on a Friday was a winner of a surgery slot. Almost all of the doctors, nurses, surgeons, were all women. I saw \*3 men\* the entire time I was in the facility and one of them was the receptionist. The other two were the 90 year old anesthesiologist who was a big joker, loved him, and his assistant. I felt so at-ease. All the pre-op was very easy and straight forward. Lots of signing papers, meeting people, etc. Everyone was just in such a great mood it was hard for me to feel anxious at all. 

Pretty much the moment the IV was in I got the nastiest taste in my mouth, gagged, then knocked out lol.

**Post-Op**

I came-to around 9:30am to the disembodied voice of my surgeon saying everything went great. It took about 30 minutes for my eyes to even focus properly which was bizarre. It was like having the spins but without the nausea. The first thing I remember feeling was just a gentle euphoria that it was done and more importantly that it was *easy*.

**Immediate Symptoms w/ pain scale (x/10):**

* Burning in the urethra from the catheter, felt like a moderate UTI. First time trying to pee was like straight fire and only a few drops - 5/10   *\*I drank a ton of water in recovery and the first “big pee” was painful but immediately relieved a lot of the urethra pain.*
* Sore abdomen - 2/10 sitting, 3/10 walking
* Shoulder pain - 4/10
* Sore throat - 1/10, barely noticeable. Felt like the night after screaming over music in a loud bar.

**Day 1** 

When we got back I was STARVING and not for light food like the soups and smoothies I had prepped. I wanted carbs. I also prepped my space with a lot of comfort food so I had some toaster strudel and tea and then fully made myself Kraft Mac and Cheese and some green beans. I could not stop eating, basically every snack in my apartment. I didn’t have much of a struggle at all standing, cooking, doing dishes. Just took things really slow, used my arms to sit up, etc. I didn’t even feel I needed pain meds except to sleep and just took Tylenol.

**Symptoms:**

* Urethra - Gone after drinking a lot of water and peeing a bunch
* Sore abdomen - 3/10 while moving, barely noticeable when sitting/laying
* Shoulder Pain - 4/10 while moving, barely noticeable while sitting on a heating pad
* Sore throat - 0/10 after a cup of tea

**Day 2**

I was desperate for a shower and felt a little light headed while doing so but again, just took it slow. Had a friend come watch a movie, took a tiny micro-dose of a THC gummy and snacked a lot. Felt most comfortable sitting up half-reclined. Worst part was my throat pain on day 2, but totally manageable with OTC pain meds.

**Symptoms:**

* Sore abdomen - 2/10 while moving, barely noticeable when sitting
* Shoulder pain - gone
* Sort throat - 3/10. Felt like my muscles and lymph nodes swelled up overnight. Took some advil and it became barely noticeable

**Day 3 (Today)**

I woke up feeling mostly normal. I’m definitely bloated and my abs are a little sore, but I felt energized. I put dishes away, had a coffee, vacuumed . . . I am honestly shocked at how fine I feel. I took the whole week off and it looks like I’ll just have a nice relaxing staycation!

**Symptoms**

* Sore abdomen - Barely noticeable
* Sore throat - 1/10
* A little dizzy
* A little bloated

**Tips:**

* Heating pad for the shoulder pain was clutch. I laid on a heating pad all day after the surgery and the pain was gone before I went to sleep!
* Pee before you leave the facility! I made the mistake of thinking I was just having some urethra pain and ended up realizing halfway home that I needed to go. Luckily, we somehow found the cleanest McDonalds bathroom in all of Manhattan.
* Drink a LOT of fluids on that first day so you can flush out the pain from the catheter. Every time I peed I felt better.
* If you are an anxious person, mute this channel the week or so leading up to your procedure. I’m serious. I absolutely think it is good and valid for people to post about their complications and fears of complications, but I found that those posts caused me to anxious-spiral so I had to mute it, just for the week. 

**Final Thoughts**

I have nothing but love for this community. I’ve been considering something like this for a bit over a year, but finally pulled the trigger this summer. I broke up with my partner of 5 years in May (long time coming) and have been a serial monogamist my entire adult life. I’m on a journey of taking ownership over my own life and this was a huge step in that journey, for me. I cannot express enough how seamless this was for me because of this community and the resources here. I am lucky to live in NYC, to have access to a LOT of doctors who are willing to do this procedure, and to have family and friends who are very supportive.

One of his first exercises was to shoot his morning routine. Another friend chimed in with their routine video, too. This lead to them asking me to create a video on my Espresso routine as they know about my love for Coffee. I have a decent enough setup for stills photography and decided to use the video feature on my camera for once. I challenged myself to only use gear that I already have other than getting two high output LED lights to go into my softbox for continuous lighting. (I initially got carried away and was thinking about buying lots of extra bits like a bottomless Portafilter, shot mirror, nice tamp station, new lights etc etc)

I had a hard time making a few shots look good enough to keep in the edit like knocking down the Portafilter and the wand wipe so decided to omit them. I'm not that great at art latte art and that was my fourth take out of six attempts. I'd leave the ""studio"" set up in the kitchen so I could shoot my coffee every morning until I got a good enough shot.

I'm overall happy with the video and looking forward to a next creative video project! I work as an VFX Editor but it's the first thing I've shot myself in over a decade, so tried not to compare my efforts against other slomo/macro offerings online when judging the output of this one.

*Continuing.*

We rigged Leslie as a counterbalance for us as were carabinered off our descent ropes. Leslie had a winch, but I wanted to reserve that in case we needed to lift something out of this fucking hole. 

Using personal descenders, we slowly made our way down the hole. 

It took over an hour, but we finally made it to the bottom. There was solid ground in about half the shaft, the other part was underwater.  

“Great”, I said, “We landed on a beach.”

“Rock?’, Arch said, “Look over there. 180 degrees.”

We had pax 134. 

A very vigorously dead pax 134. 

Male, about 25, Caucasian, and folded into a most inexplicable yoga-esque mess. He hit the ground fast on his chest, and he had hit the ground hard. 

I was just about to order a Stokes when I saw something in the water. 

Just a glint of something. Could be anything, lots of glinty metals in this mine. Could be a beer can, for all I knew.

Pax 135 floated into view. Female, age early 20s, Caucasian. Not too bad looking, but very enthusiastically dead. 

“Cletus, send down both Stokes. We’ve got two recoveries here.” I said. 

Arch looked and liked to lose his lunch. 

“Not much to do now”, I said, “Until the Stokes get here, we may as well just have a sit-down and a smoke.”

“I agree”, Arch said. “How we going to recover the body in the water?”

“We’ll use the Stokes like a strainer basket”, I said, “It’s not pretty, but it works. 

“I’m with Dad”, Arch said defeatedly, “I like the money but I fucking hate this job”. 

A cigar later, and the two Stokes baskets hove into view. I had Arch disconnect one and kept the other tethered to see if we could scoop up contestant number 135. 

Luckily, before we fiddled with the water, I had this premonition that something wasn’t quite right. 

“Arch”, I said quickly, “Zip up. Air pack! Get on oxygen NOW!”

He didn’t bat an eye; he was zipped before I was. 

Carefully, we maneuvered the tethered Stokes basket into the water to retrieve this poor unfortunate soul. 

We broke the surface tension of the water and it was like the Siege of Stalingrad. Every single one of our sensors and monitors tripped. They formed a cacophonous descant and were warbling their terse “Get the fuck out NOW!” messages. 

“Cletus”, I shouted into the radio. “Noxious mess coming your way. Get on oxygen, seal up and get anyone without SCBA out NOW!”

“Roger that, Rock”, Cletus replied. I could hear radio chatter and the EMTs beating a hasty retreat. 

“God damn murderholes”, I swore. Even if this person had survived the fall, which was very unlikely, the gasses evolved from what we loosely describe as water down here would have killed them within mere minutes.

“Sometimes I really hate being right all the time”, I thought. 

Arch was perplexed. He was also ready to run for the hills. 

“C’mon, Arch”, I said, “we’re safe, let’s finish this and get her topsides.”

Arch recovered a bit and a very tense ten minutes later, our aquatic recovery was strapped in a mylar space blanket and headed up the shaft as Cletus took up the slack with Leslie’s winch. 

I was getting concerned that we might have to climb out of this fucking shaft manually, so Arch and I secured contestant number 134 into a Stokes while we were still zipped and secured. 

“Watch your monitors”, I told Arch. “If the air down here doesn’t clear in fifteen or so minutes, it’s the long climb for both of us.”

“If it doesn’t”, Arch suggested, “Maybe we can get some extra air bottles delivered…”

“Damn it, Arch”, I smiled, “That’s a great idea. You win a cookie and a bonus once this is all over.”

I called Cletus, he called Mac, Mac called the National Guard. 

Less than ten minutes later, a small basket with four full brand-new air bottles appeared. 

“May Bacchus smile upon whomever was involved with this”, I said, as I’m not keen on shimmying up a rope for over eight hundred feet. 

Oh, I *could* do it, it’s just that I’d rather not...

Ahem. 

The line came down once again and I told Arch to ride the Stokes up with our latest participant. 

“Cletus mentioned that the last Stokes got snagged around four-hundred fifty feet. You ride shotgun and keep the Stokes off the walls. I really don’t want any loose rock raining down while I’m here.”

“Roger that, Doc”, Arch said, climbing onto the Stokes and securing his harness to the wireline that we were using with the winch. 

I watched as Arch and company ascended. I checked my monitors and everything seemed back to normal, or what passes for it at the bottom of an eight-hundred-foot mineshaft. 

I plopped down, unzipped my suit, and produced a cigar. 

“Break time”, I thought and then gave a little curse as I seem to have forgotten my emergency medicine flasks. 

But then I checked my Agency vest and By Gum, a flask of necessary medicine appeared. 

I sat in that fucking mineshaft alone for almost two hours. 

“Bit of trouble with the last Stokes”, Cletus said. “Sorry. Line coming down.”

So, like a worm on a fishhook, I dangled drearily as I was dragged out of captivity and up to the very top of the main shaft. 

“Let’s not do that again anytime soon.”, I said.

“You OK, Rock?”, Cletus asked. 

“No, not actually”, I replied. “we’re still shy one pax. Where the fuck could they be?”

“Umm, Rock”, Cletus said, “We’re on quota.”

“How so?”, I asked. “Miscount? Someone just appear out of nowhere?”

“No”, Cletus said, “Mac told me he received a note from the Medical Examiner. Remember that pax we found when we first opened the adit?”

“The one squashed flatter than a foundered flounder?”, I replied. 

“Yeah”, Cletus said. “It wasn’t one person, it was two.”

“No…”, I said, disbelievingly. “No shit?”

“Yep”, Cletus said with a noticeable shiver. “Evidently one fell on the other and then the world fell on them both.”

“Like that’s good news?”, I said, shaking my head. “I’ll be damned. That’s one for the books.”

“Yeah, it is”, Cletus agreed. “Can we get the fuck out of here now?”

“Cletus”, I said, “Since when you become a mind reader?”

As tired and fucked-over as I was feeling, I let Cletus take Leslie and I just trudged out of the mine. It was a long walk, but chatting with Cletus and Mac via radio made the trip feel shorter. 

Now, after a little rest and restoration, I had to design a way to kill this mine. And kill it most emphatically dead. 

The guys from the copper company hauled up a Company Man trailer for Arch, Cletus and me. It was a double-wide mobile home in another life, but was self-contained, had beds, a shower and a fully stocked galley. 

Mac had joined us and we were sitting around the kitchen table after our necessary post-recovery ablutions, discussing how to kill this fucking mine. 

“Here’s the deal guys”, I said, “This one has *really* pissed me off. I have over five tons of explosives with me. I do not intend to take as much as a sparkler back home with me.”

Mac, Arch and Cletus looked at me. Each backed up just a smidge. Evidently, I had murder in my eyes. 

We spent the next few hours doodling on a plan map of the mine. As a precaution, Mac had taken one of the copper company’s D-11s and dozed the open adit closed with surface regolith. We wanted no one to get into that mine after all our work getting everyone out. 

As a bonus, Mac had placed two National Guard sentries at the mine mouth, both heavily armed. No one gets in there unless we say so. 

Finally, exhaustion took over. I bade everyone good night as I retired to one of the bedrooms. I called Esme and spent the better part of an hour describing the events of the day. 

She finally told me to shut up, hang up, and get some sleep. Evidently, I was rambling a bit.

Khan and Clyde agreed, so I professed my love and told her I’d be home in a day or two. 

“Just be careful, do your job, “Esme said, “And send that mine to hell.”

“Roger that”, I said. 

I don’t remember hanging up nor slamming face-first into the pillow. 

They were these new corduroy pillows. They were making headlines everywhere…

Ahem.

The morning broke bright and early as usually happens when there’s no hurricane threatening. I plugged a cigar into my face and wandered out towards the kitchen where something wonderful was happening. 

Full Bird Colonel Rockwell Hardward was busy at the stove frying sausage, bacon, making pancakes and omelets to order. 

“Hey, Mac”, I said, “To what are you up?”

He hands me a perfect Greenland Coffee and tells me he loves to cook but rarely gets the opportunity. 

He produces an exquisitely fluffy sausage, cheese and habanero pepper omelet with a short stack on the side. 

“Hells fire, Mac”, I said, “Need a side job?”

Arch and Cletus were already tucking well into their morning repast and smiled up from their respective plates. 

Without asking, Arch got up and got me a glass of cranberry juice. 

His bonus just doubled. Damn, I was stiff and sore after yesterday’s workout. 

We really weren’t in any hurry. It was going to take a few hours to charge the mine and since we had fulfilled our quota, a terminology I came to despise; most the spectators, EMTs and root weevils had left. 

“Now I can swear and not worry that’s it’s going to show up on the 11 O’clock news.” I grinned. 

“Plus”, Arch added, “Now that the news crews have all buggered off, you won’t be tempted to toss them in the mine before we seal it.”

“There is that…”, I agreed. 

Mac had one of his National Guard people fire up one of the copper company’s D-11’s and open the adit of the mine one last time. 

Oddie showed up just in time for a late breakfast and asked if I needed any explosives as ordering and delivery around these parts “took forever”.

“Well”, I said, “If you’re offering, I could use a couple of radio-controlled detonators. I’ve got plenty of det cord and Primacord. We’re going to do a series run, and if I can use a radio-controlled detonator in the shaft, it’ll save on a lot of consumables.”

“Done”, Oddie said as he pulled out his phone and tapped in some orders. 

“Plus”, I said, “I need something like a Stokes basket. Expendable type. I’ve got something special planned for the main shaft.”

“Be here within the hour”, Oddie beamed. 

“Finest kind”, I said, referring to everyone present. 

The explosive set up was one of simplicity. We don’t want to go back into that fucking mine, but we must. So, I had designed a fairly simple manner of explosive placement for its execution. 

Basically, a long series-circuit. Place RDX/PETN at each mine face in the tunnels past the main shaft. Then run Primacord back to strategically placed cases of dynamite. Past the main shaft, and into the main gallery. I was going to wrap some of the pillars left from the original room and pillar excavation with heavy Primacord. Shear them and watch the world fall down. Of course, Arch would do his C-4 spider monkey dance on the main adit and well, Bob’s your uncle. 

Except for the fucking main mine shaft. Here, I was going to set approximately one hundred pounds of my special homebrew nitroglycerin against the easternmost wall. 

Yes, I was pissed and really hated this mine. 

Load it into a Stokes basket and secure the lot with bungee cords and come-along straps. Rig up a series of high-velocity blasting caps with millisecond-delay super boosters connected to a radio-controlled detonator. 

The only question was should I fire this first or last?

Then I did some computations. With our set up, there would be about 30 seconds of interval between the mine face explosions and the ones in the main gallery. 

Guess what was going to take up that interval?

I wrote up the blasting design as Mac mentioned that he had a group of National Guard demolition experts just champing at the bit for something like this. 

“The more the merrier”, I said to Mac. “They are all certified in underground demolition?”

“Well”, Mac said, “They’ve worked UDT and UDX, so I think they have the stones for the job.”

“That’s good enough for me.”, I replied. 

We spent the rest of the morning assigning jobs with Mac and Arch being team managers. Oddie volunteered to keep up with the paperwork as my supplies began to dwindle. 

Cletus and I were tackling the nitro/shaft job together. That’s particularly twitchy, and no one volunteered to help. 

Cannot understand why…

Cletus, piloting Leslie, was carrying the Stokes very gingerly. 

“Hey, Rock”, he asked as we slowly strode down the median-most horizontal drift, “Why are there two types of containers here?”

“Let’s just say that it’s a special surprise for my favorite mine.” I smiled. 

“Rock?”, Cletus asked, “You’re scaring me again. What is it?”

I smiled a Grinchian smile. 

“You’ll see.”

We arrived, and with eight-hundred-twelve-foot descent, the Stokes-Full-O’-Nitro took an hour and change to make the descent. I monitored the radio detonator to make certain everything was ‘go’ upon arrival. 

Cletus watched me remove a few canisters of clear, oily liquids and stash them alongside the main shaft. 

“I’m not even going to ask”, Cletus muttered as he drew the wireline back onto Leslie’s winch and chewed one of my last cigars. 

I called for a radio check and the teams all responded within minutes. Within a half-hour’s time, we were all gathered at the main shaft as we repeated a standard headcount. 

“OK, gents,” I said, “Check your pockets. You lose it in this mine, it will never be seen again.”

They all knew what I meant. This hole was going to cease to exist soon. 

With a bundle of spliced Primacord, I ran the det cord back out to the main adit. I actually tied it to the spool on Leslie and let Cletus set the pace as we walked out of the mine. 

I excused myself from the group, giving some excuse like I wanted to check the connections one last time. 

“I’ll go with you”, Arch said. 

“OK”, I replied, “But you will not say anything to anyone of what you’re about to see.”

“O…K…”, Arch replied. He had no idea what I had planned. 

He stood guard while I poured one canister of oily liquid into another of slightly yellowish liquid.

I primed it with a radio detonator and told Arch that now would be a good time to practice double-time march. 

We caught up with the crowd and walked resolutely out of the mine. 

Arch knew that it was time for his part of the show: the stuffing shut of the mine mouth adit. C-4, and youth’s agility worked their magic. He had the maw of this despicable beast charged and ready to cease to exist in less than a half hour. 

Everyone was ready to watch this murderhole die an agonizing death. 

I said “No. Not *quite* yet.”. 

First, we cleared the area and made certain everyone was accounted for, while Arch, Cletus and Mac policed the area looking for potential missiles as this old hole was sporting some five-plus tons of very high-explosives. 

With LuLuBelle, Mac gently closed the gaping maw of the mine one final time. He did so with almost a delicate touch, so as to not disturb Arch’s handiwork. 

Almost all my crew had left the previous day, along with many of the students; but there were a few thrill seekers who hung back to witness the destruction of this malevolent mine. 

I had Oddie bring up the Cat D-11T’s to block where the mine’s adit once existed. If things got out of phase, it could act like a huge cannon barrel and spew rocks and destruction out among the spectators. But, with over 350 tons of heavy iron machine between the mine and personnel, that wasn’t going to happen. 

I had four detonators, all primed and ready to go. I gave one to Arch, for the old adit. Cletus got the one for the main shaft and the nitro. I gave Mac the initiator for the three back tunnels. I kept one for myself. It was a special little number I had dreamed up when we  pulled that last survivor out of the main shaft. 

We made a big production of clearing the compass. Sure, there were not any external explosions, but when playing with demolition, one often defaults to the safer path. 

I made certain any and all spectators were well back of the mine, in case there was anything untoward in the next five minutes. 

“ALL CLEAR?” I hollered. 

“ALL CLEAR!” came the response. 

“Mac”, I said, “On three. FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE! HIT IT!”

Mac mashed down the big shiny, red button. 

The earth shook as the blasts, muffled by distance and hundreds of thousands of tons of rock shifting, collapsed the tunnels under their own weight. 

You could feel the explosion’s power through one’s shoes. It made for funny feeling feet. 

“Cletus!”, I said, “On three. FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE! HIT IT!” 

The earth shook ever harder. One could hear different containers of nitroglycerine detonate. It is just another added perk to my home brew stuff. The mine’s main shaft was sealed for all eternity.

“Mr. Arch?”, I said, “On three. FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE! HIT IT!”

The adit, now buried by ten feet of local regolith, gasped audibly and collapsed under its own weight. There was now absolutely no way into this old murderhole. 

Mac walked over to congratulate us on a job well done when he saw the maniacal look on my face. 

“Didn’t you have four detonators?”, Mac asked. 

I held aloft the last radio detonator. Little did anyone know, it was directly connected to heavy duty Primacord which was wrapped around three pillars of the old mine. It also had a side circuit that was connected to 25 gallons of rapidly mixing Eastern European Binary Liquid Explosives. 

Like I said, I want this mine to fucking suffer. 

The ground had just stopped shaking when I said, in a loud, steady voice, “FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE! ADIOS, MOTHERFUCKER!”

I pressed the button. 

The earth shook, the ground cracked. Three pillars supporting incalculable tonnage of rock were sheared off cleanly at their base. Before it could all collapse and settle, the Moldovan binaries lit off. 

There was a large bulge in the ground directly above what had once been the main shaft. It lifted, cracked and split; letting an enormous amount of dust and silt blow like the blowhole of the white whale once Captain Ahab was finished. 

There was a huge blast where excess gases of rapid combustion escaped and the geological section collapsed into the void that once housed the mine. 

It took a good few minutes before everything stopped shaking and settled back to some form of normalcy. 

Mac came over, patted me on the shoulder and declared “That is one dead mother fucker. Great job, Rock.” 

Just to accentuate the demise of this murderhole, the Cat D-11T’s were fired up and before they rolled their ponderous way back to the worksite, they trundled back and forth over the area once occupied by the mine. 

Oddie came up to me, smiled, and said “That will show’m. Good job.”

Cigars all around as I had found my emergency box in my truck. There were hoots and hollers from the crowd and everyone admitted “It was a good show”. 

We had a few hours to tidy up and finish all the bits and pieces. But, the worst was over and the whole jobsite was much more relaxed. Mac called for the C5-A transport and a Huey for Arch and Cletus. 

I was exhausted. This job had been a real pain in the ass. The sad thing was it should never have happened. I could never get a straight answer from Jimmy why he decided that this was a good idea, as he was summarily trotted off to the hospital and then jail for the laundry list of laws he had broken, some stout felonies for “behaviors that lead to death”. 

I wrote a quick by-line for the local papers warning people to stay the fuck out of abandoned mines. 

“There is nothing in those old mines that is worth your life.” 

Some of the local papers ran that as a heading. They were tired of reporting on deaths, dismemberment and the dubious antics of those that thought fucking around in old mines was a ticket to adventure.  

The flight back home went off without a hitch. I pulled my truck and trailer next to the house and decided to leave it. 

“I’ll reorient the damn thing tomorrow”, I said wearily dragging my beleaguered carcass homeward.

Es was thrilled to have me back, as were Khan and I think Clyde, although he’s always been aloof and relishes trying to trip one by walking between their feet. 

Even that wasn’t going to cast a pall on this reunion. A few hours in the backyard Jacuzzi, a couple of grilled to perfection steaks and a few adult beverages made many of my cramps and pains abate. Still, this one was a real bastard and going to be nightmare fuel for some time to come. 

The next morning I was awakened by my cell phone. Some news group or other wanted an interview. I really wasn’t in the mood. I threw the phone out the door and down the stairs. 

“So, good night’s sleep?” Es smiled as she retrieved my phone. 

“Not really”, I said. “This one was a real bastard.”

“Well”, she smiled again, “You sound like you could use some R&R.”

“That’s no kidding”, I agreed. 

“Good”, she laughed, “Because we’re spending Christmas in Turks and Cacios. Your daughters, their husbands and our new grandkids will meet us at our villa there.”

We haven’t been to the islands for a couple of years. It’s going to be great celebrating the season with the whole family. I called dibs on the grill as I hear the lobsters are really cheap down there.

*Continuing.*

“I like the way you think”, Mac smiled and pulled his own Sat Phone out and began barking orders. 

“Let me borrow LuLu”, Mac said. “I have some ideas.”

“For you or someone else?”, I asked. 

“Herr Rock, I may be a bird colonel, but I’m a cat skinner from way, way back.”, he smiled. 

“I am impressed”, I said. “Let’s see how good a military cat skinner can be.”

He caught the keys on the first try and was firing up LuLu within minutes. 

This is the sort of pace we’re going to be required to keep until the last pax is out of that mine. 

The prospect did not fill me with joy. 

The first order of business is making certain that there’s enough breathable air in the mine to support the victims and my crews. 

I am giving orders when a couple of short buses pull up and a squadron of youngsters pile out. 

“What the hell?”, I said. “Who are you characters?”

“Students”, one of them replies. 

“Of what, from where?”, I ask. 

“Various colleges and universities. We’re geologists, mining engineers and petroleum engineers. There was a call for volunteers and here we are.”

“Geologists and Engineers in training”, I reminded them. At least, they looked to be upper classmen and women. 

“Yes sir”, one replied. “Can you direct me to Dr. Rocknocker?”

“You’re lookin’ at him”, I said. 

“Hello, Sir”, the tallest one said as he extended a hand. 

“OK”, I said, “I get the drill. Forget formalities. We’re on the clock and time keeps slipping into the future. You wouldn’t be here if you didn’t know your shit and have the requisite training.”

There was discordant mumbling from the crowd of approximately twenty students. 

“OK”, I said, “Right now, we need to know the ventilation story in the mine. Haul your collective asses over to the mine. Do not enter, exercise extraordinary care, but search for any sort of openings, no matter how insignificant, that will let us pump some outside air inside.”

They sort of stood there as a unit and no one stirred. 

“When I say now, I mean 10 minutes ago. RAUS!” I bellowed. “Find me some way in for ventilation. Go!”

I don’t have time for hand-holding or mollycoddling. This is nut-cuttin’ time. I’ll make up for my nasty demeanor later. 

I realized that I’m cutting corners here. There should have been a proper orientation, a ‘say howdy’ and briefing before I let them all loose. There’s no time for that, we need information immediately. I’ll risk a twisted ankle or bruised ego for now. My main concern are the 120 idiots trapped in this old fucking murderhole. 

A quarter hour later, four of my crews arrive. These are from different jobs in my different companies, but I know them and trust them. Hell, I trained every man jack and woman jill of them myself. 

No time for pleasantries, I tell them to get on the mine and split the students into four groups, of which my teams will lead. 

I tell them to scour the mine site and find me a way in for the mini-drone and to get some outside atmosphere in there. 

No grousing, no moaning. They know their jobs and haul ass to comply. 

Now, all we need is a void that leads to the adits and galleries. 

Cletus has moved about a half-dozen cars out of the way and Col. Mac was doing some respectable grading leading up to the triple adits of this old fuckhole. We had a spot to begin access to the mine now that we could bring in the heavy equipment. 

A little geological history of the area might help set the scene. The district lies within the East Tantric Mountains, one of the eastern-most ranges of the Basin and Range region of Nevada and Utah. The range is heavily block faulted, trends north-south and has a moderate relief, rising to heights of up to 750 m above the alluvium-filled Tantric Valley. The rocks within the district comprise more than 3000 m of lower to middle Paleozoic marine sediments, including limestone, dolomite, quartzite, shale and argillite. These were cut by several sets of discordant faults, before being overlain by up to more than 1500 m of middle Eocene volcanics, such as latite [trachy-andesite] and quartz-latite [rhyolite] lavas, tuffs and agglomerates. All are intruded by stocks, plugs, dykes and sills of monzonite and quartz-monzonite porphyry [adamellite] and diabase [dolerite].

Before we go much further, this old mine is what’s known as a “Hard Rock” mine. Igneous and metamorphic rocks. Very dense, very tough, but brittle as the day is long. Here is where you search for vein deposits of precious metals. It’s a bitch of a way to mine, but every ounce of rock you remove contains at least a little paydirt. But rock pillars sometimes explode from the reorientation of ancient stress fields. A rock burst is a spontaneous, violent failure of rock that can occur in high-stress mines. Although mines may experience many mining-related seismic events, only the tremors associated with damage to accessible mine workings are classified as rock bursts. You don’t want to be anywhere near one when they happen.

The mines in Nevada and New Mexico are mostly “Soft Rock” mines, relatively speaking, composed of primarily sedimentary rocks. Tough, less dense and more prone to long-term creep and slippage than the explosive rock bursts of the current Utah mine. Here, you search for disseminated patches of placer deposits. You may move one hundred tons of rock daily, but the paydirt is going to be concentrated in very specific areas. 

This mine had a triple adit (opening) which lead to three horizontal tunnels which lead to three main galleries. Here, the rock was removed via the [‘room and pillar’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_and_pillar_mining) method. As such, there were large open areas (rooms) being supported by huge pillars of rock that the miners left for support. 

Therein lies the problem.

The first adit was the oldest, drilled by hand back in the late 1800’s. There was a team of workers with sledgehammers and one brave soul who held a long chisel, known as a ‘shaker’ or ‘shaker bar’. The sledge team pounded that shaker and slowly, very slowly, an opening appeared. They did this for the entire length of the pay dirt vein and followed until they decided to go room and pillar method. 

The second parallel adit was drilled in the 1920’s with dynamite and shaker-men drilling holes in the very living rock. Charges were set in those holes and once fired, the blasted material was carted off to the refinery to be processed. The tunnel parallels the old opening, with a good ten-to-fifteen feet of solid rock between the two tunnels for support.

The last of the three access tunnels were drilled in the late 1950’s with a rudimentary TBM [Tunnel Boring Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_boring_machine). It was self-propelled and inched it’s way ahead armed with a huge circular disc of carbide cutters. It had its own conveyer belts for removing the cut rock down and out the back of the machine. Once it inched forward enough, the tunnel was reinforced with concrete half-pipes and the machine scrunched itself up to the fresh face and began all over again. 

This one also had a good ten-to-fifteen feet of solid rock for support between the two previous tunnels.

Once the bottom dropped out of the gold, platinum and sliver markets, the mine was abandoned. However, unscrupulous ‘gypsy’ miners went in searching for easy pickings that the original miners might have missed. They focused on the ten-to-fifteen-foot walls of rock separating the three adits. Anyone with the merest moiety of their marbles could see that this was a monumentally stupid fucking idea. 

From what I’ve read, in some places the retaining walls between two adjacent horizontal drifts were separated by no more than eighteen to twenty *inches* of rock. What was ten-to-fifteen FEET of supporting rock was mined down to less than two feet in some places. Plus, it wasn’t done uniformly, so that stresses and strains holding the mine adits open were shifted at random. 

This was a recipe for disaster. 

That’s one of the reasons why the mine adits collapsed when they were shaken by that little, bitty 2.7 tremor. Thereby trapping over a hundred people who thought that an  underground venue for music and debauchery was a good idea.  

“Some people”, I groused aloud and lit a fresh cigar. 

“ROCK!”, someone shouted from the far western side of the mine. 

I got on the radio and admonished all that communications have to be via wireless. I’m not one for running around an active site trying to figure out who wants to talk to me. 

“Rock”, one of my team leaders yelled, “I’ve got an opening. Measurable airflow. Taking samples now.”

“Mark with orange smoke”, I replied. “I’ll be there directly.”

I watched for the smoke bomb and double-timed it to the source. 

Upon arrival, I got the good news that the air is isotonic with atmospheric, but there’s some of the usual mine nasties floating around, higher CO2, some H2S, some CO. Nothing immediately lethal but sitting around inhaling this junk is not going to make you last a lot longer. 

“Mark a 3-foot circle around the blowhole.”, I said. I got on the radio and ordered ventilation equipment to be brought up to this location immediately. 

We basically Hiltie™-ed (rock bolted) the edge of the large diameter hose to the rock itself and connected it to a very large primary industrial fan. Booster fans, which are large fans installed in series with the main surface fan and are used to boost the air pressure of the ventilation passing through the air ducts. We set them up for tornadic volumes of air to be moved into the mine. 

We still don’t know where the people are or even if they’re still breathing. So, go with the flow, as they say and set those fans on eleven. 

Sometimes you’ve ended up ventilating a cul-de-sac so rocks and dust come booming out of another small hole in the vicinity. The pressure built with fans we had and established one hell of an airflow into the mine. If nothing else, if we were there in time, the trapped folks would have enough to breathe. 

It’s like we had every emergency squadron in Utah on danger money. We had three medevack helicopters on the pads Mac dozed, sitting and waiting. We had EMTs, fire and police. County Mounties, local fuzz and probably a few department store rent-a-cops were milling around. 

Mac dialed in some magic and food and drink, along with a football games-worth of Porta Johns, appeared. Hell, we even had trash barrels and food service people running around handing out sandwiches, doughnuts and coffee. 

Someone, I don’t know whom, let in some of the local media. I will find out who was responsible. 

I made certain that any footage of me and my crews would end up on the cutting room floors as my narratives got a bit more blustery since they appeared. 

“Get that fucking remote truck out of here or I’ll have it crushed and melted, you muppets!”

I motioned over to Cletus who had just put down a late model Chrysler and had him amble over in the direction of the media truck. 

They moved with a renewed sudden rapidity once they saw Cletus bearing down upon them. 

“Fuckin root weevils”, I spat. “I need them now like I need a high colonic and twenty-mile hike.”

My radio lights off and I see its Arch. 

“Go for Rock”, I said. 

“Rock, found a small opening. I think we can get the mini-drone in there. In fact, I think I hear people talking. I think we’ve got us an adit.” Arch proudly related. 

“Get that drone ready. I want to see what’s going on in ten. Mark with blue smoke.” I replied. 

“Roger that”, Arch replied. I could see stirring on the west side of the mine, back of the ventilation we’ve already established. A sudden gout of blue smoke confirmed my suspicions. 

Colonel Mac had parked LuLu right where the media truck had been. 

I smiled and handed Mac a cigar. 

“Sit Rep?”, he said. 

Only a trifle annoyed, I related the ventilation system was in place and we’re scouting for other places we could repeat the procedure. I also told him about Arch’s discovery and the blue smoke. 

“Good”, is all Mac said as we hustled over to my truck to dig out the monitor and fire up a portable generator. 

“The thing is”, I mentioned to Mac, “Is that we have no idea the length or direction of the hole Arch found. We’re going to have to augment.”

“That’s going to require a couple of command decisions”, Mac replied. “Since you’re the hookin’-bull, and registered blaster, those are going to fall to you.”

“No worries”, I replied, “It won’t be the first time.”

We scrutinized every scrap of paper that could be construed as a map for this mess of a mine. From what I saw, the mini-adit that Arch found was well off to the east of the central gallery. There should be no one within a hundred or more meters. 

I called over to Cletus. 

“I need some hunks of rock to test what shaped charge I need for this project.”, I explained, “They need to be similar, and uniform, in fact, those two over there are just the ticket.”

Cletus picked up on the idea instantly. He was in Leslie and moving the test rocks over away from the mine, over in an adjacent col between the mine’s adits and an adjacent outcrop. He found two more likely looking pieces and set them in line with the others. 

Suddenly, I felt the ground shaking. Literally. And I haven’t even set a single charge. 

“No.”, I groused, “Not another tremor…”

I look down the road, and in stately procession are a brace of Caterpillar D11-T dozers, a solitary D-9 Cat with pitching blade, a pair of Terex/Bucyrus MT6300AC Dump Trucks and a largish panel truck with a jolly banner reading “HIGH EXPLOSIVES: STAY BACK”.

Seems my call for reinforcements at ground level did not go unheard. 

These gizmos and implements of destruction were from a nearby open pit copper mine and were being loaned for the duration by the Nordic Ventures Mining Corporation.

Remind me to say something nice about hard rock geologists sometime in the future. 

The really heavy equipment stopped just short of the road Arch had dozed earlier. One individual, a bristled, tall and rangy looking character walked alone up the road and stopped just short of where Mac and I were talking. 

I looked over and said, with an ever-widening grin: “Oddie, you old bastard. Thanks for coming. We’re in one hell of a mess here.”

The chap I was addressing was the COO of the aforementioned Nordic Ventures Mining Corporation, one Dr. Oddvar Brekhus.

“Yah, Rock”, Oddie smirked, “Looks like you got yourself a real messy mess here, that I can tell you.”

“Oh, yah”, I replied, “Is a big nasty bastard for sure there one time, ‘eh?”

Mac was completely flummoxed as he has never heard Yoopanese before. Y’know, dat stuff dey talk up dere in the UP? [Upper Peninsula, Wisconsin, *not* Michigan].

“Oh, hey”, I said, “Oddie, this is Colonel Rockwell Hardward. He’s my first-in-command whenever I’m out of pocket. He’s US National Guard and still an OK guy. We civilians just call him Mac…”

Mac smiles and there’s hearty handshakes all around. 

“So, Rock”, Oddie continues, “I’ve got a couple-tree dozers and dumps if you need them. I heard that there’s all sort of people involved here, so we’re at your disposal.”

“Perfect”, I said, “Right now I need a barrier as I’m about to test some shaped charges so we can go in and fly a mini-drone around to see what’s what. We’ve not been here too long, but we’ve already got ventilation going 140%. Next job, is try and see what the fuck’s going on inside.”

“OK”, Oddie replies, and gets on his radio. The three cats wander over and side-by-each, and park themselves. Suddenly there is a wall of well over a half a million pounds of yellow dozer between my test area and the rest of the world. 

“OK”, I tell Oddie. “Please set the explosives truck out of harm’s way. There’s a col over yonder and it’s easy to see from where we are.”

“No worries, Rock”, he replies, “I hope you don’t mind, but I brought my own armed security for the explosives. I hope that’s not a problem.”

I pull back my Agency vest to display my pair of Glock 10 mm and my pair of Casull .454’s. 

“Not a problem”, I smiled as Oddie looked a bit puzzled. 

“Expecting an insurrection?”, he asks. 

“Just my old Eagle Scout training”, I grinned, “Be prepared.”

“For what?”, he chuckled, “World War III?”

“No”, I laughed, “I have the contents of your truck for that.”

I had Cletus drill a 2.5” hole in the center of each of the test blocks. We, of course, had an electrical drill and core barrel attachment. Setting up the water to cool the cores and remove cuttings took a bit as I realized we’re short of potable fluids. 

“Mac?”, I called over the radio. 

“Yeah, Rock. What’s up?”, he asked. 

“Please do your magic and get a few thousand gallons of potable water delivered. We need that to keep down the dust if this extraction goes in the manner I’m suspecting.” I replied. 

“That all?”, Mac asked. 

“Well”, I noted, “since you asked, electrolyte replacement therapy for the folks trapped in the mine (i.e., Gatorade). They’ll need that more than anything. Also, some ice and cold beer would be appreciated. Or a case of Wild Turkey and Russkaya wouldn’t go unappreciated.”

Mac double keyed his microphone and I realized he was already placing his order. 

It’s kind of nice to wish for something and have it just appear an hour or so later. 

Back at work, I cut a block of C-4 into equal pieces. I made a cylindrical charge for the first test. Then a “V” shape for the second and inverted “V” for the third. The last charge I was just going to smoosh into the hole and tag with a blasting cap and super booster. 

That took me all of ten minutes and I called to Cletus and Arch as I needed witnesses. Of course, Oddie was there, but I needed my company’s representation. Besides, they wanted to break into Detonics and I need people to do the grunt work. 

In the meantime, a few hundred geophones and cables had arrived from the university. I had the grad students who showed up via short bus earlier lay out a grid over the mine, on one-meter centers. Of course, this Gen-Z bunch were all atwitter over the prospect of computers in the field, so I left them to their own devices. Arch and Mac had checked up on them a while back and they were impressed with how things were going. 

“Good”, I thought, “Better them than me.”

I got back to charging the holes for the test shots. 

All holes were primed and I instructed Arch to set up the high-speed camera in its polycarbonate box on the center dozer. It worked perfectly as it was up off the ground and really well protected by over 250,000 pounds of Caterpillar dozer. 

We’re all set within a half-hour and I looked to Arch and Cletus. 

“You know the drill”, I said. “We’re waiting.”

Arch and Cletus smiled and began to clear the compass. 

“Doc”, Arch complained, “There’s people things over to the east and north.”

“Well”, I said, “That happens. Go tell them to stand down for a while, until we’re done with our tests.” 

Cletus took the lead and within minutes, we were back on schedule. 

I handed Cletus the Captain America detonator. Simple circuit, so no real need to galv, but I did anyways. It was primed and ready for action. 

FIRE IN THE HOLE!

KABOOM!

The first test rock exploded into a million pieces and rained fury all over the yellow machines that were pretty much unimpressed with the show so far. 

Round 2. 

KABOOM!

Better, but the rock split into several large fragments. Not exactly what we wanted. 

Round 3. 

KABOOM!

There we go. The inverted “V” never fails. It punched a hole clear through the foot and a half of rock without blasting the test sample to smithereens. 

Just for grins: Round 4. 

KABOOM. 

The test subject sort of disappeared, being reduced to sand-sized, and high velocity, fragments. 

“That”, Mac said through a low whistle, “Was fucking impressive. Rock, your reputation precedes you. Remind me to never get on your bad side.”

“I haven’t known you for long, Mac”, I replied, “But I can see you’re very wise. Let’s go do some real blasting and help these poor imprisoned folks.”

I whipped up a few shaped charges, primed them with caps and boosters, and made the laborious hike up the side of the mine over to the hole we were going to make larger. 

“Cletus, Arch”, I said, “Move those geophones and cables. If anything goes sideways, I don’t want them damaged.”

“Let’s first see what the kiddies have discovered.” I said as the latest map of the mine emerged on the screen. 

“Impressive”, I noted. “Those cables and jugs moved yet?”

They were and Mac and Oddie gave me a hand setting the charge. Not knowing how deep I had to shoot, I make several shaped charges, instead of beefing one up. That way, if something did go south, instead of a smoking crater, we’d have just a nice 2.5” hole in the ground. 

The first two shots went off perfectly. In beginning to load the third shot, we all heard voices. Unhappy voices. Terrified voices. 

I had Arch load the mini-drone and we finally got our first pictures of what was going on inside this old fucking hole. 

It was pitch black, but the drone was capable of FLIR infrared. We watched the monitor as Arch flew lazy circles until he got an idea of the topography of the mine. 

I ordered the drone back and had someone get me the megaphone from the local constabulary. We also had a microphone/speaker lash-up that we tossed in the hole once the drone returned to hear from the imprisoned crowd. 

“Can you hear us?”, I said over the megaphone. It felt sort of silly yelling at rocks, but, hey, not a first for me. 

We listened and there was a cacophony of overlapping voices. Some are scared. Some are frightened. Some were absolutely terrified. All were tired and on the verge of panic. 

“We’re here with the National Guard for rescue.”, I said, hoping to ally some of their fears. They’ve been *ex communicado* for more than twelve hours. I figure an outside voice might help disconnect their fears somewhat.  

Then a voice came over the microphone loud and clear. 

“I’m Jimmy DeSantis. This is...umm…er…was my party.” The voice said. 

“OK, Jimmy”, I said, “We’ve got you 5x5. I’m Dr. Rocknocker and we’re here to get you all out. First, give me an idea of what’s going on in there.”

“Well”, he stammered, “It’s dark. Darker than I’ve ever seen. Or haven’t seen. It’s muddy and hot, but now we’ve got outside air coming in and it’s getting a bit cooler. I guess that was you guys.”

“That’s right”, I said. “Can you tell me the disposition of the crowd. Any medical emergencies? Any casualties? Any fatalities? We were told there’s 120 of you in there. Is that a valid number?”

“Fuck, I dunno”, Jimmy replied, “120 people are minimum, we sold a shitload of tickets. There’s cuts, bruises and some bleeding, but we’re dealing with that. I can’t find any of my crew, so I have no idea if…”

Jimmy shuddered and was on the brink of terror. 

I took a deep breath and was going to try and reassure him, but Mac grabbed the microphone. 

“Now listen up”, Mac bellowed. “This is Colonel Rockwell Hardward of the Utah National Guard. Listen up. You will sit down on the ground and stay put until we reach you. DO YOU HEAR ME?”

Jimmy stuttered.

“God damn it, De Santis.”, Mac bellowed, “You’re the liaison right now. Either suck it up or put someone with some backbone on the god damned phone.”

Jimmy took a deep breath. 

“Yeah”, he finally said, “I’m here.”

“OK”, he said, “Here’s the drill. We’re going to open this hole some. Might use explosives, might use a drill. Whatever, keep away until further notice. We have battery-powered flashlights that we’ll send down the hole, as well as medical supplies as needed. Once that’s covered, we’ll talk food and water. But, you and the rest of the people in there SIT THE FUCK DOWN. You can’t go wandering around that old mine, it’s beyond dangerous. In fact, you go wandering and I *guarantee* that you will fucking die. Do you copy?”

“Yes”, Jimmy said slowly. 

“Yes WHAT?”, Mac demanded. 

“Yes, sir”, Jimmy replied. 

Mac tosses me the microphone. “Just like we discussed earlier” as he shakes his head in agreement.

It was my turn to be confused. That was one of over a hundred different scenarios we’d discussed. OK, so we chose Scenario Number 147.

With pickaxe and shovel, we carefully opened that hole. It was too far from the main gallery and at such a weird angle that we couldn’t just enlarge it and go in to get these folks. But, with a little ingenuity and a lot of swearing, we delivered over 150 small, battery-operated flashlights and an acre or two of cotton gauze, medical tape, water, and topical antibiotics. 

We were still waiting on a head count when Jimmy called back. 

“What is it?”, I asked.

“The last count is 132 people”, Jimmy relayed, “But I can’t find any of my crew.”

That last sentence hit me hard. 

We were now doing a recovery as well as rescue. 

“Jimmy”, I said, “Listen up. You have air, light, water and medical supplies. It’s up to you to be the hookin’-bull down there until I arrive. Sit tight, and by that, I mean SIT TIGHT. No wandering around. If you’re alive now, you’ve be alive when we drag you out of there. Start fucking around and you’ll be dead. There’s no other way I can explain that. You’re teetering on the fucking razor’s edge of death. Don’t walk closer to it. Just sit down and wait until we sort this out. I’m hoping it won’t take too much longer, but that’s under the mine’s control. Got that?”

“Fuck, Doc”, Jimmy half-heartily chuckled, “That’s a hell of a bedside manner you got there.”

“I speak the truth”, I replied, “Please, just trust me on this.”

Jimmy rang off and I tossed Cletus the microphone. 

“Fucking idiots”, I swore. “If this DeSantis character lives, I’m going to kick his ass from here to Mombasa.”

Cletus and Arch took a step back. They were worried I might begin practice on them. I was in a bit of a snit.

“Let’s go to the adits.”, I said, “I just had an idea…”

Standing out in front of what used to be the only entrance/exit of the mine, I was waving my arms, giving folks an idea what I was on about. 

“No, no, no”, I said. “Those D-11’s are too fucking heavy. Whatever sort of open space we have is going to disappear under their mass. 

“We’re running low on time, doctor”, Mac says to me as he checks his Rolex. 

“You can’t just take a quarter million pounds of heavy dozer and just strip the surface”, I said. “Well, you can, but any open space you used to have in the near subsurface is going to give way under all that mass and ruckus. Remember, dozers aren’t what one would call dainty.”

“Well, Doc”, Mac said, “What are your suggestions?”

“Really? Including spit balling?”, I asked. Mac nodded. “Get a TBM up here *tout de suite*. Trouble is, it’d cost a fortune, if you could find one, and would take weeks to bore from the front adit, along the horizontal drift, to the trapped folks. So that’s out. Or I could blast the adits. Crossed fingers and barley injections, it’s risky, could cause further collapse and would tend to shake up the survivors.” 

“So, you’re out of ideas?” Mac prompted. 

“Hardly”, I said, “LuLuBelle is one-third the mass of one of the D-11 T’s. I could pitch the blade and put most of the weight on the lower track as I go back and forth, perpendicular to the plane of the adit. Keep the Big Boys, one at either end, to assist with chains and winches if I get in a scrape. I could shave a couple of feet in a pass and that way, if there were any openings, we’d not crush them flat.”

“It was the darkest night, there was no moon in sight. The stars ain’t shining because the sky’s too tight…”

“SCHRRECHNORE!”

“N’yup, yup, yup.”

“Fazoo. Fagroon. Kubble Kubble.”

“FLARGGG…Snitzh. Plaf. Ptooie.”

“*SPLUTTER*. What the blinkered hell?”

“Khan, you big lummox, get off of me!”

I swore quietly. Esme, my darling wife, is in her own bed snore-snuffling lightly only inches away. Don’t want to wake her and suffer the wrath…

“Damnit, Khan. Quit licking my nose. Get. GET! GET!! GET!!! Down to your three-quarters of the bed.”

Khan grudgingly arises, takes two steps southward and collapses with a loud *FLUMPH*. 

Sheesh. 

Tar and damnation, it’s bloody hot in here. 

I remove the Tibetan Mastiff’s now heavily overgrown winter coat sheddings from my mouth.

“PTOOIE!”. 

I notice something’s still amiss. 

Odd. 

I don’t remember going to bed wearing a 25-pound hat. 

Casting my eyes northward, I quietly intone: “Clyde, if you don’t mind, could you join your buddy at the foot of the bed? KNUCKLEHEAD!”

Clyde looks at me like I just asked him to calculate orbital parameters for a quick trip to Ceti Alpha Six, yawns a moon-sized sigh in my direction, and stretches. In his own damn good time, he wanders down to the end of the bed and makes a nest *on* Khan. 

[Remember this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ5vkOFyajQ) Multiply the dog by four and the cat by forty or fifty and you’d have a similar situation as to what’s transpiring currently down near the foot of my bed. 

I’m so glad that Esme talked me into the Infinitely Adjustable electro-pneumatic bed. Over a million positions for my pets to crowd me onto the floor whilst I try and slumber. 

Pets are supposed to be good for a person. Right? I seem to recall reading that somewhere. 

Calm you down, extend longevity, prevent premature expiration and all that?

At this rate, I’m estimating I’ll reach one hundred…if they don’t drive me around the bend first.

Well, Esme’s still in the Land of Nod and I realize that I may as well get up and utilize the euphemism.  

Before I leave, I remind Khan and Clyde just who the master is in this situation. I remind them that I’d sure like to get some sleep, so no sneakery-foolery before I return.

They both return a glance of “Who? Me?” and collectively yawn as they instantly return to dreamland to dream their dreamy little dreams. 

“I’m less than convinced”, I noted to the pair. “It’s not like I *don’t* trust you two…”

I return within five minutes and Khan and Clyde are now at 100% sprawledge, fully lounged, completely occupying my bed. 

“Bugger.”

I heave a heavy sigh and resign myself down to the kitchen and a cup of Greenland’s best. Then I’ll return and do battle with our insistent house pets…

I just brewed my coffee and smiled as our bespoke coffee-maker began spooling down from 100k RPM. 

I was just about the take that first well-deserved sip o’ Java when my bloody SatPhone begins a-warbling. 

“Curses”, I thought, “What now? Anasazi Insurrection? The border being overrun by Canadians? Another K/T-event asteroid on the way?”

One quick slurp of my freshly-concocted drink, and I was off to my office. I grabbed the noisy telecommunications device and unplugged my SatPhone from its charging cradle. 

“Что?”, I answered. 

I like to keep the dispatchers on their toes.  

“Dr. Rocknocker?” the phone replied. 

I see the exchange from whence the call originated. State of Utah. Department of Mines and Mineral Resources. 

“Hmmm”, I hmmmed. 

Not often we get calls from there. 

“Yes? Speaking.” I continued.

“Are you immediately available?”, the voice asked. 

Code. 

And not good code. 

“That’s affirm. 100%”, I reply, “Details?”

“Reference: State of Utah Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources: (7435)-UTAH0248, 3388, 0170; (322)-UTAH0079, 0170; (1731)- UTAH0079, 0170; (4722)- UTAH1452, 0170. Coordinates: 39.95748°N 111.85500°W (#6838898). Data sent digitally. Hard rock Silver, Gold, Platinum mine, abandoned 1968.”, the phone informed me. 

“Copy that. Personnel?” We have lots of abbreviations when speaking about abandoned mine issues. 

“Group. So-called ‘Rave in a Cave’. Illegal gathering of approximately 120 pax, low estimate potential.” 

I tensed involuntarily. I had a bit of a shiver but got back to the problem at hand promptly. 

“Repeat one.”, I queried.

The voice on the phone continued, perhaps setting up the particulars for an obituary. Or several. Or hundreds. 

“Confidence on pax?” I requested. 

“Total is as of yet unknown. Collaborated and confirmed minimum 120 pax.”

“Oh, bother.”, I thought. 

Time *is* of the essence. 

“DTD (Details to date)?”, I asked. 

This was going to be one critical motherfucker; I could sense that already. 

“Up to, potentially exceeding, 120 pax. Shallow-focus earthquake, 0048 Zulu, 2.7 MM initiated collapse in main tunnels. Triple adits closed, ventilation unknown. Three large galleries, no known exits. High water. Grave potential for noxious gas evolution. Technical, grade 9 or above.”

It doesn’t get much worse than “Technical, Grade 9 or above” as it’s a ten-point scale.

This one’s going to be nasty. Stagnant and/or flowing water, literally exploding rock physics, noxious chemicals, total darkness, questionable ventilation, and hundreds of people, minimum, affected. 

“Copy that”, I reply, “Checking routes.” I consult my mapping apps. Not good news.

“I can’t be there for 7 to 8 hours’ but I can be on the road in less than an hour. Rouse local team. Alert authorities. I’m taking over this response as of now, 0350 hours, this date.” I said sternly. 

“Negative”, the phone replied. 

“How so‽”, I barked.

“Excessive ground travel time. National Guard C-5A Galaxy at your disposal. Has been dispatched 0300 MST. Can you assemble at local airfield?”

“Yes”, I replied, “But be aware, I’ve got a few pieces of *very* heavy equipment…”

The phone continued: “The maximum payload for this National Guard C-5A Galaxy cargo plane is 240,000 pounds (108,862 kilograms) in standard conditions. Copy?”

“Copy. That’ll work.”, I replied, “OK, I can meet them at the local county airfield. Have transport arranged for field crew. Alert them and have them respond with full P4 kit.”

“A National Guard helo is *en route*, they have been notified”, the disembodied voice replied. 

“This has all the potential for a Twin Shaft* scenario. Mobilize air movement and ventilation equipment to site.” I note. “TBM (tunnel boring machine) potential. Locate nearest and get them ready to maneuver.”

*[At 3:00 in the morning on Sunday, June 28, 1896, ninety miners were at work in the Red Ash Vein of the Newton Coal Company's Twin Shaft Mine in Pittston, PA when the roof quickly caved and flooded the workings. It was believed at the time that all workers perished.]

“Affirmative. Will notify all relevant local authorities.” The dispatcher replied. 

“Outstanding”, I said, “Alert local earthmoving contractors and medevac. Oh, yes. NO DAMNED MEDIA! News blackout until notified.”

“Message received, logged, and understood.” The phone replied and disconnected. 

“ES!”, I hollered, “Got a big-ass mine problem over in Utah. Me, LuluBelle the dozer and Leslie the Load Lifter are off to the airport.”

“What’s up?”, Es asks. “Rescue or recovery?”

“Details so far are sketchy”, I replied, “But we have over 100 folks trapped in a collapsed mine, perhaps many more. Shallow-focus quake; shake, rattle and roll. As I said, it’s in Utah so the National Guard’s sending a cargo plane.”

“So, you’re taking *all* your kit?” Es asks, wondering. 

“And then some.”, I said as I hoofed it upstairs to quickly change and retrieve my bug-out bag. 

Es has helped herself to my coffee, but I can’t be too put out as she has another, *sans* booze, waiting in the java reactor chamber. 

I’m slurping high-octane Kona, fumbling with a fresh cigar, and tripping over my own damned shoelaces. 

Es grabs me by the shoulders and gives me a good shake. 

“Deep breaths, Doctor”, she commands. “Best you get there a minute or two late than not at all. In. Out. In. Out…”

“Thanks”, I said. “There only so much a human can do. This one sounds like a real Charles-Fox [Clusterfuck] situation. I’m deeply concerned.”

“Sounds like you should be”, Es agreed, “But you amaze them time and time again. Remember your wits. Rely on your training and experience. This will be one for the books.”

“Es, darling. I’m really sorry about all this”, I said, “I recall you wanting to do some Christmas shopping this week; but this one really needs me and my crews.”

“The stores’ll still be there when you return”, Es smiles that particular smile. “The needs of the many outweigh the needs of this one. For now.”

“Message received”, I smiled and gave her a deep kiss. 

I may not show it, but I’ve got a serious *Star Warsian* ‘bad feeling’ about this one. 

“What are you taking for ordnance?”, Es asks. 

“Everything”, I reply. “I don’t know the lay of the land out there, or availability of explosives. Therefore, I’m taking the whole shed.”

“Well”, she smiled crookedly, “Make certain you tell the pilots what they’re carrying. That stuff is the second most important commodity flying.”

“Yes, dear”, I smiled wanly. Damn, she could see through me like I was a bottle of Moskovskaya. She knew I was a bit anxious and not brandishing my usual brave, deferential derring-do.

“Time to boogie”, I said, and kissed her for probably a few seconds too long, while hugging her a bit too tightly. Even Khan and Clyde were downstairs to fret a bit and bid farewell to me. 

“Keep in touch”, Es admonished. 

“As best I can”, I replied, “No matter what, this one’s going to be a right omnishambles.”

“Just you be double damned careful”, Es said as I disappeared out into the backyard. “Remember, you’re a new Grandpa.”

That shot a jolt through me like a .45/70 Government hot-load. 

It hit me so hard, I double packed the C-4, triple-packed the PETN and decided to send the nitro via governmental courier. I took both my Casulls and Glocks for peace of mind. Utah could be holding some nasty viperine, ursine, or feline nasties.

My truck fired over immediately and we pulled out into the blackest of black that black night had to offer. 

Once on the Highway, I called Cletus and Arch. They were already apprised of the situation and were getting ready for dustoff. 

“Rock”, Cletus said in a slightly shaky voice, “I hate flying. I fucking hate it. In fact, I’ve never even been in a helicopter before. I’m just not too sure…”

“Cletus?”, I said, “It’ll be fun, it’ll be fun, it’ll be fun. How does double salary sound until the resolution of this little peccadillo?”

“What?” he said incredulously. 

“That’s right”, I said, “You’ve just been bumped to US$100/hour. Arch as well. That help quieten your fears?”

“Fuckin’-A, Bubba.”, Cletus said much more soundly, “Damn. When’s that fuckin’ chopper gonna get here?”

“Soon”, I had thought rather than said. There’s a lot of work to do before I’m wheels-up. 

I’m crawling around my trailer, in pitch blackness at the local aerodrome. I’m waiting on National Guard aviation while winching down and duct taping everything that could imaginably come loose. 

The nitroglycerine has already been picked up via courier. Esme called and reported it so matter of factly, the drivers almost believed that the stuff wasn’t really nitro. 

Es had assured them it was and for them to exercise extraordinary care. 

I had my VLF radio tuned to the proper frequency, and finally heard the roar of the four TF39 turbofan engines rather than the chatter between the pilot and ground crew. The latter were the ones who were worried about the Galaxy’s landing requirements. 

“Yo, Nat Guard C5A heavy”, the tower chatter went, “This isn’t DFW fer chrissake. Orbit west until we get confirmation.”

“Here’s your confirmation”, one Bird Colonel Rockwell ‘Mac’ Hardward shouted over the wireless, “I say that we need max. 1,500 meters. You got that in grass. Clear a fucking path and prepare for landing.”

Colonel Hardward took no shit from anyone. He’s all charge and go. I think we’ll get along just swell…

There was immediate scuttling of ground crews and while I was directed off the landing line, there suddenly appeared floodlights that illuminated the entire pitch. 

“National Guard C5-A heavy”, the chatter began, “Cleared to land on field parallel runway 22-Prime. Begin descent at your discretion. Nil traffic. Wind WSW, 4.5 knots. Visibility fifteen miles. Good luck.”

“Roger that”, the pilot’s voice assuredly resonated over the radio. 

“Holy fuck!”, I said to myself as the monstrous C5-A broke cover and began its descent below the low scud of clouds that were pre-empting morning. “That’s one fucking monster of a plane.”

Even I was impressed, and I’ve actually flown in the Antonov An-225 Mriya.

The pilot set that cargo plane down like he was flying Air Force One after the New Year and Ronny had a tummy ache. 

He only needed 1,200 meters as he was totally empty. He spun the plane around, goosed the engines a might and wandered over close to where my equipment sat; eyes nervously scanning for mud or loose sand. 

The rear cargo dock was already open and the hands were securing whatever they were supposed to secure before taking on a few tons of mobile freight. 

Colonel Hardward was standing on the fantail of the plane. I walked over to introduce myself. 

“Hello!”, I said entirely too loudly. “I’m Dr. Rock. Thanks for the lift.”

“Where’s your shit?”, Colonel Hardward ordered. 

“It’s that pile of yellow and black iron sitting over there, about one hundred fifty meters distant.” I replied. 

“Keys.”, he simply said. 

“Nope”, I replied. 

“What?”, the Colonel countered.

“My gear.”, I said. “You want it moved, you come to me.” 

“Dr. Rock?” Colonel Hardward fumed, “You are still a member of the US Army Reserves?”

“Ahhh, fuck”, I thought. “He’s got me.”

“Injured reserves list”, I joked. 

“Keys”, is all he said.

I tossed him my spare set with the admonition that the vehicles were wound really tightly. 

I also should have notified him they were carrying approximately five tons of very high explosives, indeed; but I didn’t. The cargo hands and pilots knew though. 

“Roger that, Doctor”, he said without the merest wink towards danger or threat to his command. 

A soldier took the keys and sprinted towards my truck, LuLuBelle, and Leslie the Load Lifter. 

He did a quick once-around, opened the door to my truck and fired her up. 

Over to the C5-A, he pulled forward and with stunning alacrity, had my rig in reverse and up the ramp. 

“Fuck”, I said to no one in particular. It’s like they do this every day just before tiffin, just for grins. And they are known to take tiffin pretty durn early as well. 

I fired up a cigar and wouldn’t you know it, exactly ten minutes later, I was being hustled up the airplane’s rear ramp. Seems that I needed to OK the lashings the ground crew had placed upon my truck and dozer. 

“Looks like a go to me”, I said. 

“Good”, Colonel Hardward said. “Now, anything fucks up, it’s on you.”

“Peachy”, I muttered, remembering my fun-filled times with the US Military and associated comrades. 

With that, I was shown a very picayunish fold-down seat. 

“OK”, I said, “This is where it ends. I need something a little less feeble for my less than petite size.”

The Colonel actually smiled and showed me a more business-class style seat for my more business-class ass. 

“Remember”, I groused, “I’m doing this out of the goodness of my heart.”

“Yeah”, the Colonel chuckled, “That and for the stipend, free drinks, miles and airtime.”

“Which reminds me”, I said, “It’s got to be 1700 hours somewhere. Where’s my drink?”

One of the flight attendants began to demur, but Colonel Hardward intervened. 

“It’s his way of working. So far, there’s been no objections. A *Rocknocker* today or triple vodka, Doctor?”

“Why yes, thank you.”

Colonel Hardward actually smiled as he went forward with my drink order. 

Drink in hand, I went over my inventory and placed a Herculean order from the local National Guard Armory in Salt Lake. 

Drinks gone, I stood up to shake a bit of the fuzz from the old brainpan and went back to check on LuLuBelle and Leslie the Load Lifter. 

No one had said a word about my cigar when I first came aboard. So, I figured another one wouldn’t cause too much consternation. 

I lit up a nice little maduro number as Colonel Hardward sauntered up. 

Things must be going to plan as he had ratcheted down the tough hombre act and was asking some genuinely intelligent questions. 

“Call me ‘Mac’”, he said after a few dozen questions. “I figure if you can take ‘Rock’ with all your degrees, that I could do likewise from behind all this fruit salad.” He noted, pointing to his chest bespangled with a vast number of military ribbons, insignia, bits, and bobs.

“And here I thought you were trying to soften me up so I’d offer you a cigar.”, I smiled. 

“Yeah,” he smiled back, “There is that as well.”

The flight was slated for 3.5 hours, due to weather, tailwinds and traffic in the LA-Salt Lake City corridor. We had priority, but there’s only so much airspace. 

Mac and I sat and chewed the rag and smoked cigars, much to the consternation of the Gen-Z flight attendants. 

“I’ve read your FECR (Federal Civilian Employment Report), your active dossier, and your SF-144. Impressive stuff.” Mac mentioned. 

“Thanks, Mac”. I replied. “I’m not above noting this whole project has given me a very slight case of the gibblies.”

“Bad?”, Mac asked. 

“That’s the damnable part of it”, I replied, “Could be a flash in the pan or a total disaster. We won’t know until we open the mine and drag those idiots out. God damn it all to hell. ‘Rave in a cave’? Don’t the local authorities subscribe to *’Stay out. Stay alive*?’”

“It is the stupidest thing I’ve heard in years”, Mac agreed. “But, as long as we’re dropping trou here, let me confide in you, Rock. I’m terribly claustrophobic. I couldn’t do what you’ve done, even in a shallow rescue. Hell, the thought of deep recovery makes me absolutely knee weak.”

“OK”, I said, smiling. “That’s good to know. You’re going to be my #1 liaison on the surface. When I’m not around or in the mine, you take over as first prime-in-command. You’ll not have to go one inch into that mine if you don’t want to. Let me and my crew handle the deep, dark, dangerous shit. You handle the locals, newsgroups and constabulary. When this shit is all over, I’ll buy you a drink or nine.”

A manly handshake ensued and I had another friend for life. 

“So, Mac”, I said, “Why are you here? Why send someone that hates dark, tight, enclosed, and stupefyingly dangerous places?”

“I love how you describe your workspace”, he chuckled. “Just luck. I was there. Then I wasn’t. Now I’m here. It’s complicated. It’s the military.”

“Gotcha.”, I said. 

“I need to ask”, Mac continued, obviously a bit befuddled. “Why do you think that you’re the boss of the job?”

“Senor Herr Mac”, I said, “I don’t think that; I *know* that. It’s part and parcel of my contracts with the US Government in general. *I’m* the hookin’ bull on every job until *I* say I’m not. This may sound self-aggrandizing or a load of braggadocio, but there’s no one on this ol’ planet with my education, experience and skills. I’ve written countless papers on the dangers of old, abandoned mines and have closed over 250 of the damned things, personally, in seven states. Occasionally, I get some military nimrod that thinks he knows the job better than me. My team and I usually have to drag them out, kicking, and screaming that they’ll never go into an abandoned mine ever again. Tends to keep the competition down.”

“So, you’re fearless?” Mac chuckled. 

“Oh, hell no.”, I said. “I keep myself and my team alive by being thoroughly fucking scared to death.”

Mac sighs heavily; I don’t think that was the answer for which he was looking. 

Suddenly, Mac arises and wanders over to my trailer. He looks closely at my cast-iron kit. 

“Nice truck and dozer, but what the hell is that thing on the back?” he asked. 

“Just a little gift from a couple of guys at the Agency. I’ve had Agency ties for decades.”, I smiled, “Mac, meet Leslie the Load Lifter.”

“Son of a bitch”, he shakes his head and laughs. “The ‘real’ Agency! We just got something similar. But it’s all hush-hush. And then you’re here in the Dismal Swamp Boonies with one fucking lashed to his dozer. And that’s another whole question….”

“A craftsman is known by is tools.”, I smiled, “So I won’t say anything about the five tons of HE I’ve got stashed in LuLu, Leslie, and my truck.”

Mac closed his eyes, shook his head and muttered that my SF-144 is going to need an update from the psychiatric department.

“Oh, don’t worry”, I said cheerfully, “I keep all the blasting caps and superboosters in their own, padded locker.”

“Sounds like you could use one”, Mac chided. 

“Every chance I get”, I laughed.

We arrived in Utah, in the mine’s vicinity. Our Galaxy C5-A spends a quarter hour searching for a place to set down. Luckily, there’s loads of playas (dried up lakebeds) in the area. The pilot, after a seeming lifetime, decides the one most proximal to the mine site will be appropriate. 

We finally touched down, light as an anvil, in Utah. We’re really out in the sticks, the only thing I see is a flotilla of cars from the party goers currently trapped in the mine. 

Once spooled down, the back of the plane opens, ready to disgorge my tools and implements of destruction.

The exceptionally well-trained flight hands pull my truck, LuLuBelle and Leslie the Load Lifter out of the C5-A. We are at the mine site within minutes.

“OK”, I say to Mac, “Job #1. Move these cars away, out of the line of fire. I’ll need medevack platforms, roads, tank farms, staging areas…Call whomever and roust every tow truck driver from Moab to Hurricane to Salt Lake. Careful, if this is anything like Houston, it’ll be a feeding frenzy.”

A minute or two later, a Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopter alights and Cletus and Arch stroll out. 

“Arch, Cletus”, I hollered, “Glad to see you. Arch, prep the mini-drone. Let’s find us a way inside.”

“Roger that,” Arch said. 

“Cletus?”, I yelled, “Fire up Leslie, clear the front of that mine. Move those cars. I don’t care where, just move’m the fuck outta the way.”

“That’s affirm,”, Cletus said and wound his way over to Leslie. 

“You’re going to move those cars?”, Mac enquired. 

“Yep”, I said. 

“What if you damage them?” he asked. 

“Tough shit. Let the survivors take it up with their insurance companies.”, I growled, “They are here in violation of state, local, and federal laws as well as guilty of pissing my crew and I off. They’re also trespassing and they’ve ruined my weekend. They’re currently physically trapped. Do you think the disposition of their car is the first thing on their minds?”

“You’ve mentioned having like a panic room and stuff before, so I figured you’d know where to go… I tried calling, wellll *whispering*, out to you a couple times.”

“Okay…” You suppose having another person around can only be helpful.  “Let’s lock the doors and shutter the windows.”

You and Melanie secure your loft and turn on the TV.  You’re both glued to the news, although you can only find scattered reports matching what Melanie said earlier.  Aliens have invaded, and civilization is in shambles.  At 3PM the electricity cuts out.  You awkwardly sit around with Melanie; although you try to make some small-talk, you don’t really have anything in common.  As darkness falls, you make some peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches for dinner.  It’s eerily quiet.  There’s no screams or explosions.  No lone gunshots ringing through the night.  The stillness lures you into sleep.  You let Melanie have the couch, while you take your bed.  

You’re startled awake when an alarm goes off just past midnight.  It’s battery-powered and would only activate if… You grab your guns and rush out of the room to see one of those things is inside the apartment, having ripped right through your door.  Melanie lets out a piercing screech and it leaps towards her.  You level your shotgun as it grasps her in its claws with a chirp.  You know she only has mere moments until the insectoid dices her into wet chunks, they aren’t the type to take hostages.  Melanie turns towards you, still trapped in its lethal arms.  Her face breaks out in undiluted panic, and she screams for the monster to stop.  You can see her life passing before her eyes; no matter what you do, she’ll die, but maybe you can make her death a useful distraction.  With a tear running down your face, you empty both barrels of your shotgun and blast right through Melanie and into her would-be killer.  Even though you save Melanie from a slow death at that monster’s hands, it doesn’t even flinch.  You fumble with the holster and pull out your handgun.  Holding it out at arm’s length, you shout, “stop! I-I’ll shoot.”

It looks down at Melanie’s corpse and chitters curiously before dropping her.  It continues towards you, eager to add another body to its kill-count.  You empty the clip, only for the bullets to fall lamely to the floor, failing to even crack its exoskeleton.  In response, it holds its arms out in the same hug it used to kill your co-workers and likely hundreds of others.  You run to the living room.  You need a weapon to protect yourself from this degenerate creature that killed Melanie.  

You trip over the carpet and stumble into the couch.  Through bleary eyes, you scramble on the coffee-table for *anything*, any tool you can hold in your hands to defend yourself with.  It towers above you, mandibles squirming in a piercing chatter, and you spin around to make your last stand.  You wildly bludgeon it and finally succeed.  The hideous monster screeches with pain and flails about, before scampering off to lick its wounds.  You look down to see the weapon that will carve out humanity’s freedom and avenge Melanie along with all the other innocents killed by these savages.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

I've been branching back out into dating since the end of Oct (30s F) and it has been a shit show haha. Here's the latest, lemme know your thoughts: 

A friend's friend propositioned me for a date last week. He's a little extra, clearly has an affection love language, and was coming on a little strong, but our conversation was engaging and fun, and my friend vouched for him as a ""good guy"", so I said yes. 

First date, we go out for dinner then karaoke. Again, a bit overly affectionate, lots of staring deeply into my face kinda thing, but in general fun and engaging. A little cuddling at the karaoke bar and when we left, I invited him over for a bit. We made out for a little while, nothing hot and heavy. At this point, we had had a decent amount to drink, and he did not want me to drive him home, so I offered him my bed and slept on my couch. He was bummed out, but I told him I wasn't looking to jump into bed with him and to sleep well. Made him coffee in the morning and wished him a good day before going to work. 

He invited me over to his place for a second date the next day. He cooked dinner, we had a couple glasses of wine, and then we went out to play a little pool before returning to his house. No making out happening, a kiss here and there, mostly just chatting and listening to music. Suddenly, he changes the song, pulls me off the couch and starts backing up as if we're going to dance in the living room or something. That is until I realize he is pulling us back toward his bedroom. 

I immediately stop him and remind him that I'm not looking to jump into bed right now and oh boy. Suddenly he albeit stomps his foot like a child and says ""I don't want to waste my time. I mean, do you even find me attractive?"" This dude is in his late 40s... I'm like, I let you put your tongue in my mouth, I'd say there was attraction. But I pulled away and now he's asking me if he messed up. I said yes. Then he reverted to being affectionate, layed his head in my lap and kept asking me about how he messed up. I cordially stuck around for another half hour or so and left. On the way out, he asked if we could see each other again, I said we'd see each other around. 

That one little phrase turned me off, though. I'm sure I've already answered my own question, but is it wrong of me to completely dismiss him at this point? That whole interaction was a HUGE turn off, and frankly, telling someone you don't want to waste your time because they wont sleep with you on the second date seems rude to me.

I get really bad withdrawals, but I’m trying to ween myself off of Pepsi Max. I did this during my first time of Titration (Methylphenidate IR), I just had 2 (just enough to stop withdrawals) and then a week after had less than 330ml per cup until I only needed one. Once I was off of them I went right back to my usual intake so I’m trying to ween off again before I start so I only need 2 cups of 300ml instead of 330ml. It’s been difficult because i don’t feel completely myself, just a bit off. I’m keeping hydrated in other ways too so I would only have maybe 1L a day but now I’m back down to 2 cups of 330ml.

Anyways, I’m just trying ask if having these 2 cups a few hours before I take them. I’m not titrating yet but I will be next week but I just want to know if I’ll be okay to take it a few hours before so my body at least has a chance to process some of it. I don’t want to go cold turkey just because that won’t be a pleasant experience and also not really recommended because you won’t be able to tell what’s causing what side effects. 

I want to limit as much as I can, so hopefully in a few weeks I’ll be down to 1 cup, maybe less and it’s all I need. I just want to know if it will be fine because my body’s process some of it by then. On methylphenidate, I had it while taking my meds and tried it after and the only thing I noticed was an increased heart rate while I drank it with my Pepsi, but that was all. I know Elvanse works differently so I may react differently so would be taking it a few hours after be okay? Like I said, it’s just until I manage to ween myself off. I’ve been already doing this since I knew i was starting (was complicated). 

Thanks.

She asks me a million questions about my past. I've always been so guarded, and felt completely at ease with this stranger. I feel I can share without judgement - and she shows genuine compassion and sympathy. I was like omg.

I have never felt like this. Or if I have, I can't even remember the last time. I'm feeling butterflies.

I then asked more about the issue she is currently going through: she is getting a divorce, and her ex wants to take the kids on holiday. I ask her how long for, and she then tells me she is traumatised to talk about it.

I realised in that moment a line had been crossed, I felt awful afterwards. I just wanted to show some compassion in response - after all, here was this person giving a shit about me, you know?

She gave a really long answer, but then asked me why I asked that question - and I just said that I was curious. I generally wanted to show the same level of compassion for her struggles as she was for mine. But I know I messed up by asking and just hope I didn't upset her.

I then messed up again when paying - almost on instinct, as this person has made time for me, I paid for both our coffees. She rushed to give me some change. The whole dynamic behind paying was the furthest thing from my mind in the moment. I wanted to show my gratitude. I would have done the same if it was a man. 

I'm socially awkward at the best of times. Just feeling a bit guilty about the whole thing at the moment.

Hopefully it's not awkward at the next meeting. 🤦‍♂️",3,1733681763.0,CoDependentsAnonymous,0,1.0,False

But, how do you personally choose when to use which thread size? Is it just by the material, or does the situation effect your choice? When would you decide to additionally ""double stitch"" for seam strength and would that effect your thread choice? Do you ever feel like you've used too large of a thread?

And bonus to thread question: colored thread?! I've been really enjoying matching it for projects, but it seems like every good color match only comes in tiny spools. Do you suck it up and buy lots of little guys, or do you adapt to use less perfect colors on larger spools?",5,1733681698.0,myog,3,0.86,False

Any recommendations for the following categories?,"Looking for third wave coffee shops with great coffee and cool interior design. Similar to Sey Coffee in NY or Maru Coffee in LA. Not a big sweet tooth person so the coffee is more important to me. 

Also, looking for some good nature/good scenic views. Also an aquarium would be dope. 

Also into art/museums. Into modern art more than historical. 

Any places to meet other gays (international/ local/or maybe a mix of both)

A good rock climbing gym. 

Live music. 

Thank you!",2,1733681667.0,koreatravel,0,1.0,False

I was going to make a big batch with cold brew concentrate, vodka, Mr. Blacks coffee liqueur, and homemade nocino, and serve it with dessert.

My wedding is smaller (50 guests) but there are only going to be 1-2 bartenders only, so I still feel like it's unreasonable to ask them to shake every drink. 

Any thoughts on if it's possible to get foam on an espresso martini without shaking it on ice? Sacrilege I know but not sure how else to get 20-40 martinis on the dessert table quickly! Thanks in advance :). ",2,1733681646.0,cocktails,9,1.0,False
