I (23F) met this girl (27F) , through volunteering. We’ve seen each other about 6 times, always in group settings. She’s very affectionate in person: long tight hugs, hands on my shoulders, lots of smiling, once or twice a wink/squinty smile only with me. She also said she’d like to invite me to her place for a coffee sometime.
But over text she’s inconsistent: sometimes warm, sometimes she views messages and doesn’t reply (even to holiday wishes). She doesn’t really initiate or ask much about me.
Neither of us has clearly said we’re queer, so there’s some ambiguity.(I'm pretty sure she's queer)
I’m trying to understand: does this sound like normal friendly behavior, or possible interest mixed with uncertainty? Or am I just projecting?

I spent Christmas with cousins who got married young and now have kids in elementary school. One runs a small coffee shop on the side, her husband runs a larger business, and she fits in Pilates after the school drop off. Their life looks steady, balanced, and built with intention.

It made me reflect on my own path.

I am 31 (F) and just finished my PhD. Career wise, I am in a very strong place and genuinely proud of how I got here. I built my own financial stability and spent years focused on growth and learning. It was not always easy, but it was purposeful.

I am also in a healthy relationship, which I value deeply. We have not talked much yet about marriage or kids, and while that uncertainty exists, it did not feel heavy this time. It simply feels like something I need to be clearer about moving forward.

Being around my cousins did not make me feel behind or envious. It reminded me of something I have always known. I want marriage. I want kids. I want a life that feels both meaningful and well rounded.

I have always wanted that life. My timing is just different.

Ending the year with that clarity feels grounding. Different seasons call for different priorities, and I trust that this one has prepared me well for what comes next.

Lately it’s starting to feel like I’m paying for that conditioning in tiny cuts all day. Like last week I was waiting for my coffee and this guy behind me kept asking personal questions, where I work, do I live nearby, am I “always this quiet”. I did the usual smile, short answers, hoping he’d get bored, and the barista even gave me a look like, you ok. When my drink was ready I said “Have a good one” and walked out, and he followed me outside for a few steps saying “wow you’re fast, you got a boyfriend or what”. My whole body went cold, and I heard myself do that stupid friendly laugh again before I could stop it. I got to my car and sat there mad at HIM, but also mad at me for reacting like I owed him softness. Then two days later at the grocery store an older man blocked the aisle with his cart and said “smile, it cant be that bad”, and I said “No thanks” and walked around him. He looked genuinely offended, like I’d kicked his dog. I keep replaying it because I’m still trained to think I did something wrong by not performing pleasantness for a stranger. I’m tired of measuring my safety against some random man’s feelings, tired of turning myself into a warm customer service version of me just to get through normal errands.

Not like one pencil line, like full on commentary, hearts, “OMG nooo”, even a grocery list on the inside cover. I took it to the desk becuase it’s literally damage, and the librarian sighed and said this has been happening with that same card number. I felt my stomach drop because I knew it was Lena. I texted her like hey, please stop writing in library books, they’re not yours. She replied “relax it’s just paper” and sent a laughing emoji. Two days later she returned another book and I saw her at the drop box, she folded down like 5 pages right in front of me to “save her spot”. I snapped and told the desk worker it was her, and they pulled her account and suspended her borrowing for 30 days plus a replacement fee for the marked book. Now Lena is furious saying I ratted her out, that libraries are “funded anyway” and I made her look like a bad person over “tiny harmless habits”. Our mutual friends are split and I feel gross, but also those books aren’t free. AITJ?

* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

Like most people, I’ve tried every budgeting app out there, and I always ended up back at Google Sheets because I wanted control. But I hated how manual and ""boring"" standard spreadsheets were.

So, I built the **Wealth App**.

I’ve been testing and breaking this script for a long time to make sure it’s actually ""smart."" Here’s what it does differently:

* **Automated Month-End:** You don’t have to do any math at the end of the month. One click archives your data and rolls your balances over to the next month automatically.
* **Visual Themes:** It has a built-in theme engine. You can pick presets like ""Matcha Latte"" or ""Obsidian,"" or use the custom color picker to make it look exactly how you want.
* **Real-Time Charts:** Your ""Real Balance"" and ""Budget Check-in"" charts update the second you log a transaction.
* **Dream Goal Tracker:** There’s a dedicated spot to track big purchases (like a laptop or travel) so you can actually see your progress toward your goals.

**The Best Part:** This is a **one-time purchase of ₱700**. There are no subscriptions, no ""premium"" upgrades, and no hidden fees. Once you have it, you own it forever. It’s the only tool you’ll need to track your money for 2025 and beyond.

I’ve even included a ""Welcome"" tutorial tab inside the sheet to get you set up in less than 5 minutes.

1pvc5ak,https://v.redd.it/n796q45kcc9g1,My Little Christmas Miracle,"This was me (m55, non-op) two days ago, at 9w 2d - my first climb since my Achilles rupture on October 19th.

It was a huge milestone. Bouldering and climbing are such an integral part of my life; initially, I had assumed it would be 6+ months before I could get back to climbing, 9+ months before I would be bouldering again. My PT told me early November: “Nonsense! If things go well, you could be climbing in the boot by Christmas!” He was right.

I’ve had mixed reactions from friends and family. I can understand the concerns that non-climbers specifically might have; to them, climbing can seem like a high-risk sport even for a healthy person. It must be said that I wouldn’t encourage a non-climber who is going through the Achilles rupture recovery process to attempt this.

However, this route (the yellow/black holds) is an easy ‘ladder’ (grade IV/4a). It’s part of the training wall for beginners and requires no complex technique. For me, this was 4 minutes of slow, careful and effective cardio and upper-body work - **most importantly, with my PT’s blessing.**

I firmly believe that the physical and mental health benefits of staying connected to my gym have been vital. Since week 2, I’ve kept up twice-weekly visits. At first, I literally just sat on the mats, drank coffee with my friends during breaks, filmed their beta occasionally if they were stuck. But that evolved into taking my first booted steps there on the soft mat with their support, doing my mobility exercises and some core work, and eventually moving to the hangboard and doing low-level ‘any hold’ traverses.

That’s just the physical side of things. The social side was, at the beginning, even more important: getting out of the apartment and over to the gym (even if it was an effort, not being able to drive); talking to the great people there and enjoying the social contact (the climbing community is a really open, welcoming and inclusive one). The support from everyone, including the lovely family running the hall who paused my annual membership without me even asking, has been massively positive.

Risk is never zero: when you take the boot off for a shower in the early days, or do that first single-leg raise as you progress … no matter how careful you are, you can’t be absolutely sure how it will go until you do it. So you weigh up the pros and cons and make your decisions. For me, that means easy, safe, auto-belayed climbing for now … the challenging routes, and then the bouldering - that will all come, when the time’s right … whenever that is. I can wait.

I wish all of you a great Christmas, even those dealing with pain, perhaps setbacks - best of luck on your recovery journeys … may you find your own way back to the sporting passions that make you feel alive!",3,1766664740.0,AchillesRupture,1,1.0,False

Before boarding, I was waiting at the gate and she was sitting right in front of me. I was on a call with my friend, talking and laughing while waiting for the flight. I did not really notice her at first. At some point I saw her walking around the gate area. I am not sure if she noticed me or got curious from there. I did notice her and thought she was pretty, but I just went back to my call.

When we boarded the plane, I took the window seat. There were three seats in the row, and she sat next to me. We did not start talking right away. When I was taking a picture of the sunset from the window, she asked if I could take a picture for her with her phone. I said sure and took the picture for her. After that, I did not talk much and ended up falling asleep.

About an hour and twenty minutes later, I woke up. The plane was still flying and the view outside looked really good, so I started taking pictures again. I noticed she was looking out the window and it felt like she wanted to take pictures too. This time she did not ask me. She was just pointing her phone toward the window trying to take a picture herself. I insisted and told her I could take the picture for her. I took it and then asked her if the pictures were good.

That is when the conversation really started. She initiated it by asking if this was my last stop or if I had another connecting flight. I told her this was my stop. From there, we talked about her studies and my studies, her family and my family, the coffee she likes and the coffee I like, the weather, traveling, and our plans for Christmas. I was hesitant because it had been a long time since I had a real in person interaction like this. I did stutter a bit and felt nervous, but I kept talking. She was nice and the conversation felt genuine.

Most of this conversation happened in the last twenty minutes of the flight, so everything felt rushed. When the plane landed, she stood up, wished me Merry Christmas, and then hurried out quickly. I know her name. I watched her rush toward baggage claim and outside. I thought about asking her for her Instagram multiple times, but I was unsure. I did not want to make things awkward or chase her while she was rushing.

Part of me feels like I should have asked while we were still sitting on the plane. Another part of me feels like it would have been easier if we were walking together toward baggage claim so I could ask naturally. But she rushed ahead, and I got confused in that moment. The timing disappeared, and now I regret it. It feels like there was something there, but it ended before I could act.",1,1766664570.0,dating_advice,2,0.67,False

Opens with a bright bergamot note reminiscent of lemon rind (giving signature TdH EDT vibe), immediately contrasted by a burnt resin or lac-like accord that adds a rugged, smoky edge (lava is mentioned as note but to me smells very similar to melting lac/ sealing wax). Within minutes, a smooth black coffee note emerges and gradually takes the lead as the burnt-resin facet softens. By the 10–15 minute mark, the fragrance settles into a something like a blend of dark coffee and lemon rind, both clean and slightly bitter in an addictive way.

For me, this is the boldest release of 2025. Happy to get my hands on this miniature to experience this piece of art. Whether I’ll go for a full bottle or not, will decide later.

My brain was a chaotic mess and I liked it that way constantly bouncing between tabs, shows, and notifications.

But I kept seeing research about the benefits, so I decided to bore myself to tears for two months and see what happened.

Week 1: Pure torture. Not exaggerating, sitting still for 15 minutes felt physically painful. My mind would race through every embarrassing moment from middle school, my weekend plans, and what I might eat for dinner all while supposedly ""focusing on my breath."" I checked the timer every 30 seconds.

Week 2: Still awful, but slightly less so. I stopped fidgeting constantly but still had this mental bargaining thing where I'd think ""just 5 more minutes, then you can quit."" Downloaded three different apps trying to find one that would magically make it easier. Spoiler: none did.

Week 3: Something shifted. I started noticing the gaps between thoughts. Brief moments maybe 10-15 seconds where my mind actually settled. It felt like finding tiny islands of quiet in a stormy sea.

Week 4: Getting easier. The resistance before starting diminished. Instead of dreading it, I began seeing it as a break from the constant input. Started doing it first thing in the morning instead of reaching for my phone.

Weeks 5-8: Weirdly addictive. Some days were still struggles, but I noticed if I skipped a day, things felt… off. Like I'd forgotten to brush my teeth or something. The practice started feeling necessary rather than optional.

What changed beyond just sitting quietly:

My reaction time slowed down. Not in a bad way I just stopped immediately responding to everything. Someone would say something annoying, and I'd notice the urge to snap back, but could choose not to. That space between stimulus and response is real.

My sleep improved dramatically. I used to lie in bed with thoughts ping-ponging around for hours. Now I could actually direct my attention away from the mental noise.

I became weirdly aware of physical sensations. Tension in my shoulders, tightness in my chest stuff that had always been there but I'd been too distracted to notice.

By the 10–15 minute mark, the fragrance settles into a something like a blend of dark coffee and lemon rind, both clean and slightly bitter in an addictive way.

I’m looking for some outside perspective because I feel really conflicted and stuck.

I (24M) have been with my girlfriend (25F) for about 3 years. We dated 6 months and now we live together for almost 2,5 years. It is my first serious relationship. Objectively, she is a good partner and our relationship is not toxic or chaotic, which makes this decision even harder.

**The good parts:**  
She loves me deeply and genuinely cares about me. Our communication is generally good, even about difficult topics. We can spend time together easily, watching Netflix, gaming, talking, and it feels calm and safe. I actually feel very peaceful with her, almost like being with a close friend, which I know is important in long-term relationships.

She helps around the household, cooks, cleans, and contributes financially. She has a small job and pays part of the rent and food, although I cover most expenses. She eats quite healthily (even if she doesn’t exercise much. Healthy life-style is important for me), looks good, is smart, and has a nice family. She has a dog and I like him, even if the hair everywhere can be really annoying and sometimes I get mad.

Overall, I feel emotionally safe and comfortable with her.

**Where I struggle:**  
Over time, the relationship has started to feel more like a friendship than a romantic partnership. Sex is a big issue for me. We have sex maybe once a month, sometimes even less. I’m not asexual, I do want sex, but with her it just doesn’t excite me anymore. She often experiences pain, so sex is very limited (usually one position), and there’s no real spark or playfulness left.

Another issue is lifestyle and drive. I work a lot, often 12-hour shifts, and I’d honestly describe myself as a bit of a workaholic I also go in the gym and help my mutter with her work. My girlfriend works around 4 days a month, it pays okay per shift, but overall she earns very little. She sometimes feels neglected because I spend so much time working, while I feel pressure and responsibility to build something long-term.

When I come home and ask what she did during the day, it’s usually things like cleaning, cooking, laundry, walking the dog. I appreciate those things, but over time it feels very repetitive and minimal. I don’t really see strong ambition toward work, learning, or building a future. She tends to procrastinate and leave important things to the last minute.

Financially and life-wise, I feel like we haven’t moved much in three years. She hasn’t really saved or invested, and we don’t create many experiences together. We’ve been on two vacations that I planned, and a few group trips organized by friends, but as a couple we rarely initiate things ourselves. Sometimes I honestly feel like we’re living a “retired” life and we’re 24 and 25. The only thing we do is going in new coffee shops in our city to try different things.

**Emotional distance and future concerns:**  
For the last two months, I’ve felt emotionally detached. I don’t show her love the way she deserves, and I’m not even fully sure why. I care about her deeply, but the romantic motivation just isn’t there anymore.

We also differ in how we express love. She needs a lot of physical touch and reassurance, while I need more space and independence. I often feel like I can’t meet her emotional needs properly. She tells me that there is no problem, that she sees other positivities in me and it is worth it.

There’s also tension with my family. My mother doesn’t really like my girlfriend because she feels my girlfriend doesn’t show enough interest in her. For example, on Christmas she wished her Merry Christmas very late (around 11 PM), and my mom took that personally. It adds another layer of pressure and discomfort for me.

Regarding the future: at the beginning of our relationship, my girlfriend didn’t really want children. Over time, partly because of me, she started wanting a family and can imagine marriage with me. I, on the other hand, feel like I’ve slowly lost the clear vision I once had and I am a bit against marriage. She says she could live without marriage for me, but that almost makes me feel worse, like she’s adjusting herself while I’m emotionally pulling away.

**My confusion:**  
Nothing is “bad enough” to clearly leave, but nothing feels right enough to fully stay. I care about her, respect her, and know she would fight for this relationship. At the same time, I don’t feel inspired or motivated anymore, and I’m scared that staying would mean choosing comfort over growth and eventually resentment.

I can imagine a long life with her on paper. I just don’t know if it’s the life I actually want, or if I’m staying because it’s safe and familiar.

Am I being too demanding and unrealistic, or are these signs of real incompatibility?

She also said she’d like to invite me to her place for a coffee sometime.
But over text she’s inconsistent: sometimes warm, sometimes she views messages and doesn’t reply (even to holiday wishes). She doesn’t really initiate or ask much about me.
Neither of us has clearly said we’re queer, so there’s some ambiguity.(I'm pretty sure she's queer)

1pvbsbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1pvbsbi/you_fall_to_the_level_of_your_environment/,You fall to the level of your environment,"We need to talk about why ""just have more willpower"" is terrible advice. I recently discovered research on environment design, and it completely changed how I think about habit formation. It explained exactly why I can't resist eating chips when they're visible on the counter, but have no cravings when they're hidden in a cabinet.

If you feel like you're constantly fighting against your own actions despite your best intentions, read this.

1. The Visibility Effect (Why willpower always fails)

The research I found explained that environment design isn't just helpful for habit change; it's the primary driver.

Every object in your visual field creates a psychological ""pull"" on your attention and behavior. The more visible something is, the more likely you are to engage with it. The problem is that most of us default-design our spaces for convenience rather than for our goals.

When your environment is working against your intentions:

Your willpower depletes rapidly throughout the day.

Your best-laid plans crumble in the face of visible temptations.

Your goals feel impossibly difficult despite your genuine desire to achieve them.

You aren't just ""undisciplined."" You have created an environment that makes bad habits easy and good habits difficult.

2. The Path of Least Resistance

Beyond the visual cues, there is the friction factor. The harsh reality is: ""Humans will nearly always choose the option with the least resistance, regardless of their stated values.""

We say we want to read more, but leave books on shelves while keeping our phones in our pockets. We claim we want to eat healthier, but store vegetables in crisper drawers while keeping snacks at eye level.

This constant battle against your own environment drains the mental energy you need to actually work toward meaningful change.

3. How to ""Design, Don't Decide"" (The Fix)

The only sustainable way forward is to redesign your environment. The goal is to shift from a Willpower Mindset to a Design Mindset. Here is the protocol I'm using to reshape my behavior without relying on motivation:

Phase 1: Friction Audit  
You need to identify where your environment is working against you.

The Rule: Analyze how many steps it takes to perform both good and bad habits in your current setup.

The Goal: Recognize that your ""choices"" are largely determined by the paths of least resistance in your environment.

Phase 2: The ""20-Second Rule""  
Make bad habits take 20 seconds longer and good habits 20 seconds faster.

Put the TV remote in a drawer rather than on the coffee table.

Set out workout clothes the night before.

Pre-cut vegetables and place them at eye level in the fridge.

The Shift: Even tiny amounts of added friction dramatically change behavior patterns.

Phase 3: Prime Your Spaces  
Your environment should trigger the right behaviors automatically.

Create activity zones (reading chair with no devices allowed, dedicated workout corner).

Use visual cues (water bottle on desk, fruit bowl on counter).

Remove competing stimuli (no TV in bedroom, no phone during meals).

Treat your environment like a behavior programming system. You wouldn't expect software to run without the right code; don't expect your habits to change without the right cues.",2,1766663347.0,Discipline,0,1.0,False

How are you guys able to get them to work every time / have a nice extraction? After carefully reading the manual, I tried to use a capsule and the foil on top did not puncture (the plastic ""grid"" didn't push through the pod). After a few tries, I was able to get it to work 2/3 of the time but those odds don't seem that great :/

Even when the pod was punctured, coffee only came out in drips, unlike in almost every picture I saw online and here, where coffee comes out in a nice uniform ""stream"" (as I'm also used to from my normal coffee machine, but that doesn't use pods so what do I know).

Am I doing anything wrong? I always make sure to press the pod in all the way, so the metal ""teeth"" can puncture the bottom of the capsule and the capsule seals properly with the adapter. From my understanding, the pressure supplied to the pod by the machine is supposed to puncture the foil on top (by pushing it against the plastic squares). I'd **love** to get the machine to work properly, because I'd love to use it on my travels, but if I can't reliably make it work why would I carry it around.

Either the algorithm sneezed or somebody mislabeled a pallet of K120s as vintage wine.

Logitech churns out the K120 by the truckload, so the massive review count makes sense. A 4.6 average from 8,840 buyers suggests the keyboard does what it says: sits on a desk, survives coffee, and never surprises you.

The listing leans hard on comfort and spill resistance, two things that only matter after your third refill. Deep-profile keys sound comfy on paper, yet they still sit on a $20 frame made from 51 % recycled plastic. The eco claim feels like a consolation prize for the price hike.

One product photo feels lazy for a $118 purchase. Buyers in 2024 expect glamour shots, macro close-ups, maybe a cat walking on the keys. Instead they get a single mug shot.

Who pays this much? Picture a frantic office manager at 4 p.m. on a Friday. The last keyboard just died, the coffee is still dripping, and the boss needs 200 invoices typed by Monday. Overnight shipping and a no-questions return policy suddenly look priceless. That’s the moment the K270 upsell starts to make sense-cut the cord, hide the evidence, and let accounting sort it out.

For everyone else, the K120 remains a $20 workhorse wearing a luxury costume. Grab it on sale or walk past it toward actual value.

She introduced me to all her friends and was even pushing the gf thing already. Before I even got the falling in love text she sounded as she was being playful but insisting we go to Vegas to get married she wanted to marry me, id smile and call her crazy in a cute way. Seems like the same day I implied I would like her to be my Gf and also implied I felt oddly and insanely the same , especially given the short time. I’d never felt so comfortable and content actually. And out of no where like a switch after not even 24 hrs we never fought or argued or had any big disagreements. She kept telling me I was always welcome and alway welcome to come over after work to shower any time.

IVE NEVER BEEN GHOSTED, LET ALONE LEFT WITHOUT SOME SORT OF CLOSURE OR REASON. Not to mention the fact she was begging me to marry her move in you name it just hours prior. Soon as I got out the shower that day she basically stopped speaking to me 😂.

I unfollowed everyone.

But unfollowing you was necessary in a different way—because it stopped you from appearing in my feed. I’m the kind of guy who tends to get inside his own head a little too much. I recognize that about myself. I needed my attention back.

I was still processing the recent past, and even older events, while working on the house I had just bought and writing music. There simply wasn’t room for you then. Yet.

So here it is—Christmas 2025. I look to see what you’re up to.

I admire you so much. You truly have the best job ever. I know it’s hard, though. I witnessed the hustle and chaos of a busy movie production set—my first— I already understood though I moved and staged equipment for all the big music venues in Oklahoma. 30 years ago. 

You look happy. Everyone around you seems to enjoy your presence. They must see the same thing I saw the first time I noticed you. Yes, you’re beautiful—but beauty isn’t everything. I’ve learned the hard way that beauty without restraint can be dangerous. You have it all, K.

You’re always allowed a change of heart, with no consequences, of course. You could tell me I imagined everything, and I’d say I’d been awake too long and was delusional. We’d laugh about it and never speak of it again.

I digress.

I saw on your profile that you were incredibly close to me four weeks ago—literally one block away. That’s wild. I work at the 2323 high-rise building. I’d buy us a cup of coffee at the café. I’d love to hear about your adventures. Maybe I’d share one of mine—like the dangerous passage through a cloud forest on my way to hike the upper Amazon.

I have no expectations. I truly never did. But saying I didn’t want to know you personally before deciding anything would be a lie.

So here it is—no disguise. Just me.
B.

And please know this: I will never chase you. I think it’s ick. I’d like to say it’s because I’m older than you, but the truth is I’ve always been chosen. It goes way back. If chasing is required, I’d be out as a love interest.

But if you just want to read this and understand what I’m like, I’ll summarize:

I’m a collection of experiences—processed, refined, and meticulously compartmentalized for easy reference. I can give more details if you ask. Honestly, I can give all of them, even through text if that is preferred. 

One warning, though:
I do not lie—directly or by omission.

Christmas morning comes and my family starts taking turns opening gifts. It comes to me and I open my first gift. It’s a regular sized coffee mug! Sweet!

It comes back around to me and I open another coffee mug. And another. And another. And another.

So, my wife and kids got me like 12 coffee mugs for Christmas that year. They were basically all I opened. After mug #7 it was getting harder to hide my disappointment. Then I opened 5 more.

Family thought it was hilarious, I played along as best I could but they could tell the joke was wearing thin and that my feelings were slightly hurt by the lack of any real effort or thought in my gifts. I also felt like an asshole for feeling disappointed so that was even worse.

Fast forward a year. The story of the mugs has been told and retold, and over the past year I expressed my both my sincere gratitude for the unlimited supply of coffee mugs and also my sincere desire to not receive more cups in the next couple of decades.

It’s Christmas Eve and we’re going to open one gift each. The kids open theirs, my wife opens hers, and then they hand me a good sized box and I unwrap a…coffee mug. 

I was so unable to hide my facial expression that my wife cried. The cup is actually a nice Lord of the Rings themed one, and I feel bad for making her feel sad.

Posting anonymously. I’m not here to blame anyone — I just want to share this to feel lighter and move forward with clarity.

I’m a 20M first-semester college student who formed a deep emotional bond with a 19F classmate. She is already in a committed relationship, and I’ve known that from the beginning. I genuinely believe she’s innocent and not playing with me — it feels less like manipulation and more like two people unintentionally crossing emotional lines.

A small but important backstory:  
When we first met, I was the one resisting. I thought her warmth was just casual affection. I was busy with academics, playing guitar, participating in college events, and didn’t want to misread anything. When she first asked me to go for coffee, I said no. Later, I felt bad — not romantically, but humanly — that someone was trying sincerely just to be friends with me. That’s when I asked her instead.

What made our bond different was the kind of conversations we had. We talked a lot about ambitions, studies, goals, and life direction — not just romance. For her, this was probably new: someone to discuss growth and purpose with rather than surface-level romance. That’s likely why the connection deepened naturally.

We also come from very different worlds. She’s from a small village and hasn’t experienced much yet. I had a flashy life before, but most of it disappeared due to family problems and circumstances beyond my control. We’re still struggling to rebuild. That contrast made even small moments feel significant — like eating simple Maggi together, or sitting and drinking a cold drink while I saw her eyes fill with water, quietly holding something back. There was no drama — just a shared emotional weight.

Over time, emotional intimacy grew — daily conversations, flirting, physical closeness like holding hands, and comfort that created attachment. She shared personal photos (not explicit, but intimate enough), and often prioritized spending time with me.

Some moments that blurred lines:

* Once, casually, I referred to us meeting as a “one-sided date.” She didn’t shut it down — she just laughed.
* We went on a bike ride together once for shopping, spending time alone in a way that felt more than platonic.
* She told me she shares many of these things with her boyfriend, which made it feel acknowledged yet unresolved.

She knows I’m emotionally attached and that I have feelings. I’ve been honest about that. At the same time, she clearly says she can’t move forward because she’s loyal to her partner. So nothing becomes official — but the closeness never really stops.

**The cycle I got stuck in:**  
After spending time together, my insecurities surface. I overthink my place in her life, feel emotionally overwhelmed, and sometimes end up fighting with her. These fights don’t come from anger or control — they come from confusion.

What’s strange is that after every fight, instead of distancing, our bond becomes stronger. We talk it out, understand each other more, and grow even closer. Recently, she’s tried to act more “normal” and maintain some distance — but she also breaks that resistance at times, pulling me back into emotional warmth.

I don’t think she’s doing this intentionally. I think we both underestimated how powerful emotional closeness can be when timing and boundaries don’t align.

**Why I’m stepping back now:**  
I’m choosing distance not because she’s wrong, but because the situation is hurting me. We’re currently in our semester exams, and after that she’ll be going home. Maybe she’ll miss me, maybe she won’t. I won’t deny that a part of me hopes she does — but I can’t live on that hope.

For now, I’m focusing on my exams and regaining emotional balance. I’m sharing this here to let it go and move forward.

I just want to know similar stories and how things should move now?

Our story is much similar to the show ""The Office"". My instincts tell me that she loves me. The thing is that she is just occupied romantically only.

I think the best partner is with whom your ambitions match.  
There is a lot of idealism in this situation. I am uncertain about the future.

I never lied to her that “we’ll just be friends,” because deep down I knew that wasn’t fully true. I’ve always been honest about my thoughts, even if it’s just a tiny 0.1% chance I feel we could be more. The odds of even meeting her were almost zero — I’m from a different state, moved here because of family problems, and never expected this to happen. So when we did meet, how could I not allow myself to intentionally expect the unexpected this time?

Falls ihr weitere Beiträge habt, die Eurer Meinung nach gut zu den ""Pearls of the Past"" passen würden, schreibt bitte die Mods an.**

Ich hatte ehrlich gesagt nicht so richtig Lust auf diesen Beitrag, weil das Wetter die letzten Tage eine 180 Grad Wende hingelegt hat und ich minimale Kopfschmerzen habe. Aber irgendwie habe ich den Anspruch an mich selber, diese “Reihe” zu Ende zu bringen. Außerdem erfährt man so einige echt interessante Sachen über spezifische Themen.

Ihr habt vermutlich im Amöben-Thread gelesen, dass Lara Opfermann auf den Post von Christian Wolf reagiert hat, in dem er behauptet, dass die Deutsche Adipositas Gesellschaft (DAG) quasi die gleiche Methode (eine Formula-Ersatztherapie) wie sein WPF als “erfolgreichste Strategie für langfristigen Fettverlust” betitelt.

**Zu Lara Opfermann erstmal:** Sie ist laut ihrem LinkedIn-Profil und ihrer Website Ernährungswissenschaftlerin und hat auch eine B.Sc. in Ernährungswissenschaften. Zudem bietet sie Ernährungsberatung (2024 zertifiziert von der DGE) und Ernährungstherapien an \*. 2022 hat sie zusammen mit dem deutscher Medizinjournalist, Fernsehmoderator, Buchautor und Diätassistent Sven-David Müller ihr erstes Buch “Fettkiller: So geht abnehmen richtig!"" veröffentlicht. 2024 folgte ihr zweites Buch “Hallo Psyche, hier ist dein Darm: Mit der Nervennahrungs-Methode Burnout, Depression und andere psychische Erkrankungen angehen”. Aktuell scheint sie ein Bachelorstudium in Psychologie zu absolvieren. 

**Zusammenfassung ihres Posts (Bild 1und 2):**

Sie beginnt mit der Aussage, dass Proteinshakes kein langfristiger Mahlzeitenersatz sei und auch nicht automatisch eine Formula-Diät darstellen würden. 

Sie verweist auf den Post von CW und meint, dass sie es prinzipiell gut finden würde, wenn man wissenschaftlich argumentiert. Dies sollte jedoch richtig und vollständig geschehen.

Sie wirft Wolf vor, Aussagen aus den Leitlinien der DAG aus dem Zusammenhang gerissen zu haben und daher irreführende Informationen verbreitet zu haben.

Sie fasst die Punkt, die in den Leitlinien stehen würden, so zusammen:

1. Formula-Diäten sollten maximal 12 Wochen eingesetzt werden und nicht dauerhaft.
2. Vor einer Formular-Diät wird eine medizinische Untersuchung des Patienten empfohlen, um Risiken und Kontraindikationen ausschließen zu können.
3. Eine begleitende medizinische Betreuung des Patienten sei erforderlich, vor allem bei Vorerkrankungen und laufender Medikation.
4. Die Therapieform kann bei Patienten mit einem BMI ab 30\*\* eingesetzt werden, um einen schnellen Gewichtsverlust herbeizuführen. Es sei keine langfristige Ernährungsmethode.

Was für sie jedoch noch wichtiger sei, ist die Differenzierung zwischen Proteinshakes und Formulaprodukten. Formulaprodukte seien bilanzierte Diäten und unterliegen gesetzlichen Vorgaben, da sie eine ausreichende Nährstoffversorgung sicherstellen müssen.

Zu guter Letzt betont sie, dass man bei wissenschaftlichen Leitlinien kein Cherry-Picking betreiben sollte.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Allgemein halte ich den Post für sehr gut, jedoch sind mir hierbei einige Punkte (ich mag es ungern Fehler nennen, da ich im Gegensatz zu ihr keinerlei wissenschaftlichen Background habe) aufgefallen, die Wolf leicht in die Hände fallen und er leider auch ausgenutzt hat.

Wie ich in dem anderen Beitrag erwähnt habe, liegen in den Leitlinien der [DAG ](https://register.awmf.org/assets/guidelines/050-001l_S3_Praevention-Therapie-Adipositas_2024-10.pdf)zwei Empfehlungen vor, in denen Formula-Produkte genannt werden. Einmal Empfehlung 5.13 und die Empfehlung 5.14.

**Bei der ersten Empfehlung** wird der Aspekt der Mahlzeitenersatz-Strategie genau beschrieben. Angepeilt wird eine tägliche Kalorienzufuhr von 1200 - 1600 Kalorien. Erreicht werden soll dies, indem in der Gewichtsverlust-Phase üblicherweise zwei Hauptmahlzeiten durch energetisch definierten Mahlzeiten oder Formulaprodukten ersetzt werden. Als mögliche Ersatzprodukte werden auch Eiweißgetränke und -riegel genannt, wobei ca. 200 – 250 kcal pro Mahlzeit erreicht werden sollen. In der Gewichtserhaltung Phase soll nur noch eine Mahlzeit ersetzt werden. 

In der Empfehlung sind keine Vermerke zu spezifischen medizinischen Begleitungen, Voruntersuchungen oder begrenzten Zeiträumen (außer Gewichtsverlust- und Gewichtserhaltungs-Phase). Belegt wird diese Empfehlung durch zwei Metastudien. Die [erste ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30675990/)analysiert 23 Einzelstudien und die Evidenz wird als moderat gekennzeichnet. Die [zweite Metastudie ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12704397/)analysiert 6 Studien. Die Evidenz der Studie wird in der Empfehlung nicht beurteilt.

**In der zweiten Empfehlung** soll eine Energiezufuhr von 800 – 1200 kcal/Tag angestrebt werden. Diese Art von Ernährung soll nicht länger als 12 Wochen gehen. Laut der Empfehlung kann diese Restriktion mit üblichen Lebensmitteln oder mit definierten Formulaprodukten durchgeführt werden.Gleichzeitig sollte  auf eine Trinkmenge von mindestens 2 bis 2,5 l pro Tag  geachtet werden, da vermehrt harnpflichtige Substanzen anfallen. Diese Kost sollte von einem regelmäßigen körperlichen Bewegungsprogramm begleitet werden, um den Verlust von fettfreier Körpermasse zu begrenzen. 

Es wird geraten, diese Therapieform bei Patienten mit einem BMI ab 35 einzusetzen. Wobei auch Patienten mit einem BMI ab 30 nicht angeschlossen werden würden, wenn diese bereits andere erfolglose Ernährungstherapieversuche durchlaufen haben.Anschließend gibt es noch eine ganze Liste von Indikationen, aber auch von Kontraindikationen. Letztere Liste ist länger und interessanterweise stehen auch Essstörungen darauf. 

Nach der sehr niedrigen kalorischen Kost folgt üblicherweise eine mehrwöchige Umstellung auf eine ausgewogene Mischkost von 1200 – 1500 kcal/Tag und danach auf eine Kost von 1500 bis 2000 kcal/Tag zur Gewichtserhaltung.

Begründet wird diese Empfehlung durch zwei Studien. Bei der ersten handelt es sich um eine [Metastudie](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30923163/), die die Auswirkung  intensiver Nahrungsmittelersatz-Therapien auf Patienten mit Adipositas und Diabetes Typ-2 untersucht. Diese Studie wird als moderat gekennzeichnet. Die zweite [Metastudie ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26775902/)wird interessanterweise in der Evidenz als niedrig bis sehr niedrig angegeben. Eine weitere [Studie ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21673653/)kam zu dem Ergebnis, dass das Risiko für einen Wiederanstieg des Körpergewichts nach Programmende sehr hoch sei.

Im Nachhinein konnte ich zusätzlich noch einen Zusatz finden, wo innerhalb der Leitlinien Produkte zum Mahlzeitenersatz nochmal genauer definiert werden.

“Produkte zum Mahlzeitenersatz sind fett- und energiearme Austausch-Mahlzeiten für kalorienreiche Standard-Mahlzeiten. Der Austausch einer Mahlzeit durch derartige Produkte konnte über einen Zeitraum von vier Jahren ebenfalls zu einer erfolgreichen Gewichtsstabilisierung beitragen.”. Diese Aussage wird ebenfalls mit einer[ Studie](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10968732/) belegt.

Ich denke, man erkennt sehr schnell das kleine Problem, was ich mit dem Post von Opfermann habe und welches Wolf ideal in die Hände spielt.

Sie fasst in meinen Augen die Empfehlung 5.14 ganz gut zusammen. Jedoch ist dies nicht die einzige Empfehlung, in der Formula- , bzw. Mahlzeitenersatzprodukte erwähnt werden.

Um zu sehen, welche der beiden Empfehlungen mehr dem WPF ähnelt, habe ich einmal geschaut, wie viele Kalorien man am Tag ungefähr zu sich nimmt.

Laut dem Rezeptbuch von CW und Sabrina Mirella Börke (Biene) sieht WPF vor, dass man das Frühstück quasi durch zwei Proteinshakes ersetzt, eine kleine Mahlzeit mit max. 450 Kalorien und eine große Mahlzeit mit 750 Kalorien zu sich nimmt. 

Bezüglich der Shakes war ich schon verwirrt, da Wolf, Toni usw. die doppelte Menge Milch + Proteinpulver trinken. Also quasi 4 Shakes am Tag. Da das Programm selbst jedoch von zwei Proteinshakes spricht, halte ich mich an die Angaben, die auf den Dosen stehen.

Ich habe zum Beispiel jetzt mal den Dark Cookie Crumble-Protein Iced Coffee gewählt (an dieser Stelle die Frage, was bitte der Unterschied zwischen Dark Cookie Crumble und Dark Chocolate Cookie Crumble sein soll). Netterweise stehen auf der Seite schon gleich die Kalorienangaben, wenn man eine Portion in 300 ml Mandelmilch (welche ja abgesehen vom Matcha verwendet wird) zubereitet. Ein Shake hat knapp 158 Kalorien. Das durch zwei Shakes ersetzte Frühstück hat also um die 316 Kalorien. Und darauf rechnen wir jetzt die maximalen Kalorien beider Mahlzeiten, also 450 und 750.

Damit würde man 1.516 Kalorien am Tag zu sich nehmen. Damit würde WPF an sich eher der ersten Empfehlung, die eine tägliche Kalorienzufuhr von 1.200-1.600 anstrebt, ähneln. 

Rein theoretisch kann WPF auch der zweiten Empfehlung ähneln. Im Blog von More gibt es einen “Beispieltag” für Proteinfasten. Dieser besteht aus einem Protein Clear (ca. 104 kcal),, einem Protein Iced Latte (ca. 158 kcal), einem Protein Porridge (eigentlich 217 kcal, aber ich rechne mal 250 g Heidelbeeren á 143 kcal dazu), einem Proteinriegel (192 kcal) und der großen Mahlzeit. Bei letzterem ist kein Beispiel angegeben. Wenn diese exakt 750 Kalorien haben würde, hätte man am Tag 1.372 Kalorien zu sich genommen. Wenn man letzteres jedoch durch eins von Bienes Rezepten ersetzt (zbs. die Gemüse-Creme-Pfanne), läge die tägliche Kalorienzufuhr bei 1.196 Kalorien. 

Sowohl für die kleine, als auch die große Mahlzeit gibt es Rezepte, die teilweise deutlich weniger sind als die angegebene Höchstmenge. Und je nachdem, welche man nimmt, kann man schnell unter 1.200 Kalorien landen.

Da das Grundprinzip eher der ersten Empfehlung ähnelt, kann man es eher damit vergleichen. Und daher ist es in meinen Augen etwas schwierig, ausschließlich die Punkte aufzuzählen, die ausschließlich der zweiten Empfehlung angemerkt werden.

Diesbezüglich habe ich sie auch privat angeschrieben. Dort sieht sie ein, dass es in dem Aspekt natürlich schwierig ist und sie sein Programm auch nicht wirklich kennen würde (kann man an dieser Stelle theoretisch kritisieren). Es würde ihr aber primär um den Punkt gehen, dass es in den Empfehlungen um Formular und Mahlzeitenersatz geht und nicht um Proteinpulver. 

In dem Aspekt habe ich mal versucht, ein wenig zu recherchieren, um Klarheit zu bringen, was die einzelnen Produkte überhaupt sind.

Mahlzeitenersatzprodukte sind Nahrungsergänzungsmittel, die eine Mahlzeit ersetzen sollen. Sie enthalten eine ausgewogene Mischung von Nährstoffen wie Kohlenhydrate, Proteine, Fette, Vitamine und Mineralstoffe und sind oft für Menschen, die ihre Kalorienzufuhr kontrollieren möchten. Bekannte Anbieter sind Slim Fast oder Almased.

Formulaprodukte sind Nahrungsergänzungsmittel, die eine vollständige Ernährung bieten sollen. Sie enthalten ebenfalls alle notwendigen Nährstoffe wie Kohlenhydrate, Proteine, Fette, Vitamine und Mineralstoffe, jedoch in höheren Konzentrationen als ein Mahlzeitenersatzprodukt. Diese Produkte werden oft für medizinische Zwecke verwendet, wie z.B. bei Krankheit oder nach einer Operation, wenn eine normale Ernährung nicht möglich ist. Obwohl sie darauf ausgerichtet sind, die gesamten Ernährungsbedürfnisse eines Menschen zu decken, können sie auch als Mahlzeitenersatz verwendet werden. So eben auch als Teil eines Gewichtsverlustprogramms.

Proteinshakes wiederum sind Nahrungsergänzungsmittel, die speziell dazu dienen, den Proteingehalt in der Ernährung zu erhöhen. Im Gegensatz zu Mahlzeitenersatz- und Formulaprodukten fehlt ihnen die ausgewogene Mischung von Nährstoffen, da sie eigentlich als zusätzliche Zufuhr von Proteinen gedacht sind und nicht als Ersatz von Mahlzeiten.

Das  sind soweit die groben Definitionen, die ich gefunden habe. Jedoch wollte ich nochmal sicher gehen und schauen, was in den Leitlinien konkret gemeint ist. 

Beginnen wir mit dem Zusatz, der unabhängig von den Empfehlungen vermerkt ist (an dieser Stelle einmal die Entschuldigung, dass ich den nicht schon im ersten Beitrag erwähnt habe, aber im Chrome-PDF-Reader habe ich die Suchfunktion nicht gefunden). In dieser werden Mahlzeitenersatzprodukte als fett- und energiearme Austausch-Mahlzeiten für kalorienreiche Standard-Mahlzeiten bezeichnet. Da eine Studie vermerkt ist, schauen wir da auch mal rein. Es ist eine einzelne Studie mit 100 Patienten, wovon jedoch nicht alle unter Adipositas leiden sondern teilweise “nur” leichtes Übergewicht haben. Dort ist von einer isoenergetische Diät mit zwei Mahlzeiten- und Snack-Ersatzprodukten (vitamin- und mineralstoffangereicherte Shakes, Suppen und Riegel) sowie einer Mahlzeit mit hohem Obst- und Gemüseanteil die Rede. Nach drei Monaten wurde erhielten alle Patienten für weitere vier Jahre dieselbe kalorienreduzierte Diät (1.200 bis 1.500 kcal), wobei nur noch eine Mahlzeit ersetzt. Jeder Mahlzeitenersatz enthielt 200 bis 220 kcal, 14,0 bis 17,0 g Eiweiß, 27,0 bis 33,5 g Kohlenhydrate, 5,0 bis 6,6 g Fett und 4,5 bis 6,5 g Ballaststoffe mit Vitamin- und Mineralstoffanreicherung. Klingt nicht nach Proteinpulver.

Bei der ersten (als moderat gewertete) Metastudie der Empfehlung, die eher nach WPF klingt, werden Mahlzeitenersatzprodukte als einzelne Nahrungsmittel, Lebensmittelprodukte oder Getränke, die als Ersatz für Nahrungsmittel verwendet werden, die normalerweise bei einer oder mehreren Mahlzeiten verzehrt werden, mit der Absicht, die tägliche Energieaufnahme zu reduzieren, um Gewicht zu verlieren oder das Gewicht nach einer Gewichtsabnahme zu halten. 

Diese Definition umfasst nicht nur Produkte, die gezielt als Mahlzeitenersatzprodukte zur Gewichtsabnahme vermarktet werden, wie Suppen, Shakes und Riegel, sondern auch portionierte Fertiggerichte. Darunter fielen teilweise auch mit Protein angereicherte Produkte, wobei hier nicht klar ist, ob es sich dabei explizit um Proteinpulver handelt. Insgesamt ist auch hier nicht von Proteinpulver die Rede und interessanterweise wurden Studien mit essgestörten Probanden ausgeschlossen. Angesichts des LinkedIn-Beitrages von CW ist das fast schon witzig.

Die zweite Metastudie der ersten Empfehlung (wo keine Bewertung vorliegt) ist von handelsüblichen, energiereduzierten Produkten, die mit Vitaminen und Mineralstoffen angereichert sind, die Rede. Also ist auch wieder nicht von Proteinshakes die Rede.

Dementsprechend würde ich sagen, dass Opfermann hier einen sehr guten Punkt gemacht hat. Zwar hat Wolf nie direkt behauptet, dass seine Proteinshakes Formula-Produkte seien, durch den Vergleich jedoch impliziert er, dass sie gleichwertig zu diesen sind. 

Und das ist eben nicht der Fall. Sie sind nicht einmal ein Mahlzeitenersatzprodukt, da ihnen die Nährstoffzusammensetzung wie eine normale Mahlzeit fehlt. 

Jedenfalls war dies die Einschätzung zu dem Post von Opfermann.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Kommen wir zu Wolfs unfassbar stoischer Reaktion.** 

Auf LinkedIn hat er natürlich gleich mal einen Beitrag rausgehauen (Bild 3-5):

Erst einmal behauptet er, dass eine Ernährungswissenschaftlerin nicht in der Lage sei, die Leitlinien richtig zu lesen. 

Er gibt an, dass Opfermann sich über seine Empfehlung aufregen würde, zum Abnehmen eine Mahlzeit durch einen Proteinshake zu ersetzen. Und meint, dass sie behaupten würde, dass die Leitlinien der DAG davon abraten würde, Mahlzeiten länger als 12 Wochen zu ersetzen und dass seine Empfehlung gefährlich sei.

Anschließend meint er, dass dies nicht stimmen würde, da diese 12-Wochen-Empfehlung nur bei einer aggressiven Form der Formula-Diät ausgesprochen werden würde, bei der zwei Mahlzeiten durch Shakes ersetzt werden und man bei dieser nur auf 800-1200 Kalorien kommen würde. 

Dann betont er, dass bei derselben Diätform nach 12 Wochen zum Gewichtserhalt nur noch eine Mahlzeit mit einem Shake ersetzt werden wird und die Ergebnisse nach 12 Monaten gut seien. 

Und dann meint er, dass er in seinem WPF-Programm (was laut eigener Aussage das Nr. 1 Fettverlust-Programm in Deutschland sei) eh nur empfehlen würde, eine Mahlzeit durch einen Shake zu ersetzen (eigentlich zwei, aber na gut). 

Und er würde gut erklären, wie man es easy schaffen würde, in den zwei restlichen Mahlzeiten auf alle wichtigen Nährstoffe kommen. Mit Gemüse, Obst, Eier usw.(Tragischerweise hat er vergessen, Daily100 zu erwähnen).

Zum Schluss stellt er in Frage, wie die Welt funktionieren soll, wenn er, der Typ mit Halstattoo, eine Ernährungswissenschaftlerin korrigieren muss, nur weil diese zu emotional voreingenommen sei.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Und in einigen Aspekten hat er sogar Recht. Die Betonung auf 12 Wochen wird explizit nur in der zweiten, drastischeren Empfehlung ausgesprochen.

Jedoch: Der Ersatz von zwei Mahlzeiten durch Shakes wird ebenfalls in der “leichteren” Form der Formula- und ME-Therapie erwähnt. Also der Empfehlung, wo Patienten täglich ca. 1.200-1.600 Kalorien zu sich nehmen und die eher dem WPF ähneln.

Tatsächlich steht in der zweiten Empfehlung an sich gar nicht, wie viele Mahlzeiten ersetzt werden. 

Noch schlimmer wird es in seinen Instastory (Bild 6-7), wo er die Beschreibung der Mahlzeitenersatztherapie und die zweite Empfehlung 5.14 postet.

Das dreiste ist nämlich, dass genau diese Beschreibung der Therapie zu der ersten Empfehlung, also 5.13, gehört. Also der, die dem WPF eher ähnelt.

Letztendlich schießt er sich damit eigentlich nur ins eigene Bein. Sein Prinzip arbeitet ja nur mit dem Auslassen einer Mahlzeit und nicht zwei, das betont er ja intensiv. Also trifft es nicht auf 5.13 zu, wo genau das getan wird, um Gewicht zu verlieren und nur in der GewichtERHALTUNGSphase nur noch eine Mahlzeit ersetzt wird. Also, wo bereits abgenommen wurde und angestrebt wird, das Gewicht zu halten.

 Und die zweite, intensivere Therapieform scheint es auch nicht zu sein.

Warum hat er sein WPF mit den Empfehlungen der DAG verglichen, wenn diese doch so unterschiedlich sind?

Und warum ist er nicht auf den Punkt von Opfermann eingegangen, dass Proteinpulver weder Mahlzeitenersatzprodukte, noch Formulaprodukte sind? Obwohl sie das doch so sehr betont? Etwa, weil dann noch mehr auffallen würde, wie unangebracht der Vergleich mit den Empfehlungen ist?

*An dieser Stelle möchte ich noch auf einen Kommentar eingehen, der unter Opfermanns Beitrag war: “Kein Mensch braucht Formulaprodukte. Einfach nur überteuerter Mix aus 2-3 Supps.”.*

*Diese Aussage ist einfach nur ekelhaft und unreflektiert. Formulaprodukte spielen eine wichtige Rolle in der medizinischen Versorgung von Patienten, die Schwierigkeiten haben, normale Nahrung zu sich zu nehmen. Darunter fallen Krebspatienten, Patienten mit Schluckstörungen wie Dysphagie, ältere Menschen, chronisch Kranke, frisch operierte Personen oder Essgestörte. Formulaprodukte können sicherstellen, dass Patienten die notwendigen Nährstoffe und Energie erhalten, die sie zum Leben brauchen, Genesung von Patienten unterstützen und Komplikationen minimieren. Wer das nicht erkennt und als nutzlos abfertigt, sollte sich seiner eigenen Privilegien bewusst werden.*

Übrigens auch sehr bezeichnend, dass er ihr vorwirft, emotional voreingenommen zu sein. Seine Antwort ist doch um Welten emotionaler, wenn er gleich die ganze Welt in Frage stellt? 

*\*An dieser Stelle eine kleine Anmerkung: An sich kann sich jede Person als Ernährungsberater bezeichnen, da diese Bezeichnung nicht geschützt ist. Ernährungsberater dürfen ausschließlich gesunde Personen beraten, da die Ernährungsberatung als Prävention, also Vermeidung von Nährstoffmängeln und Gesundheitsrisiken, gilt. Jede Person kann eine Ernährungsberatung in Anspruch nehmen oder eben von einem Arzt als Vorsorgemaßnahme empfohlen bekommen.

Bit of a different kind of post, but figured it’s worth a try.



I’m a 28M living on my own in Nantwich. Christmas and the festive season are great for some people… but when you’re solo, it can feel pretty heavy. I don’t want to sit at home feeling isolated if I can help it.



If anyone local is also finding this time a bit lonely — or just wants someone to grab a coffee with, explore town, go for a walk, chill at the pub, anything really — I’d be up for meeting new people and getting out more.



I’m normal, friendly, and not looking for anything weird — just human connection and maybe some new mates in the area.



If that sounds like you too, drop a reply or a message. Happy to plan something casual and see how it goes.

I came here about 2 years ago and realised very quickly it takes a lot of strength to live here. To be away from friends and family is one thing. To get used to an entire ecosystem all alone in the cold is a whole other ballgame. London is cruel in a lot of ways, but, I wouldn’t trade the character development it toggled in me post Uni. Hell, I don’t have even have a friend to go and thrift shop and get coffee.But, god has it made me closer to some of my most favourite people in this world.

So, this is for everyone. The ones who are figuring it out, the ones who are alone, the ones who got broken up with, the ones who are not able to meet their family, the ones who are with their family (but, hate being there), the ones who see their friends hanging out together on social media without you, the ones who are working right now because they need to, and to anybody who needs some extra love this winter. 

Things will be better, and I am rooting for you and myself. I think it gets easier when I listen to Kid Cudi’s Love and I hope you will like it.It will get easier for you.

Можу сказати чесно: це було неймовірне кавове подорожування і точно моя найкраща дегустація за весь час. В кінці я вже трохи втомився, кожен день нова кава це теж нагрузка, але воно того було варте

Сама кава була просто шикарна. Кожен день відкривав щось нове, інколи навіть не очікував такого смаку. Я чув від людей які займаються поставками кави в Україну що зібрати таку колекцію зараз, це майже подвиг і я це добре розумію.

Here’s Exactly What Happened.,"I’d basically written off online casinos after one too many “instant withdrawal!” scams—sites that vanish, delay wins with fake “security reviews”, or void bonuses after you hit a decent payout.

Then a mate slid into my DMs: *“Try Playfina. Seriously. They pay.”*  
Sceptical? Absolutely. But my coffee was hot and my willpower was weak—so I tossed in **$30**, loaded *Gates of Olympus*, and spun like it didn’t matter.

What followed was pure disbelief:  
🔹 Spin 4: Scatter.  
🔹 Bonus round triggers—**110x**.  
🔹 Mid-free spins: *another* scatter. Re-trigger (+70x).  
🔹 Then the multiplier started climbing: 25×… 41×… 63×…  
🔹 Final cascade hit—**180x total**.

Balance: **$1,420**.

I didn’t cheer. Didn’t screenshot. I just sat there, waiting for the catch.  
*“This is where the pop-up appears. ‘Please verify utility bill and childhood report card.’”*

Instead? Nothing.  
So I hit **Withdraw** → **Litecoin** → confirm.

Then I made a cuppa—and *34 minutes later*, my wallet pinged:  
✅ **$1,420 AUD**.  
✅ Full amount.  
✅ No KYC repeat.  
✅ No support ticket.  
✅ No “congratulations—now wait 5 days” email.

That moment changed everything.

Since then, I’ve played over 200 hours on Playfina:

* Won $480 in *Sweet Bonanza* → withdrawn in 29 mins
* Hit $3,200 during a weekly tournament → paid same night
* Claimed their “Bonus Crab” daily rewards 78 days straight (yes, I counted)—all real, no fine print

What keeps me coming back isn’t the wins—it’s the *absence of friction*.

* Games load fast, stay synced, and don’t freeze mid-bonus
* Bonus terms are written in plain English (e.g. *“40x wagering on bonus only”*, not hidden in §7.3b)
* The UI hasn’t changed in 6 months—no surprise redesigns, no relocated menus
* Support responds in <3 mins and *remembers* you (shoutout to “Lena” — legend)

Playfina isn’t trying to dazzle you.  
It’s just trying to *work*—and in this space, that’s the rarest feature of all. 🖤",1,1766660454.0,BestcasinohubAustrali,2,1.0,False

I’m looking for a date before the year ends. Not a dramatic love story, not a “let’s text for three weeks and never meet” situation. Just an actual date with an actual person.

I like conversations that flow without effort. Where no one’s trying too hard, no one’s pretending to be cooler than they are, and silences don’t feel awkward. The kind where you meet for coffee and somehow end up staying way longer than planned.

The plan itself is flexible. Coffee, street food, a walk, sitting somewhere and judging strangers politely. If we vibe, great. If we don’t, we’re mature enough to say it was nice meeting you and move on.

I’m not chasing perfection or unrealistic expectations. Just someone curious, emotionally available, and willing to show up instead of disappearing mid-conversation.

If you’re in a similar headspace and actually open to meeting, say hi.  
Worst case, we have a decent conversation. Best case, we make 2025 and beyond a little more interesting.

1pvaueu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pvaueu/30m_35f/,30M & 35F,"I’ve been with a man for nearly a year, he is Muslim Iranian, I’m Caucasian Australian. He came to Aus when he was 9 with his mum and brother to seek refuge from the war and other political issues. His father and mother have been married for nearly 30 years, and they started with no money but now have a successful business. He went to a good school and has a large amount of friends (mostly white Australians and very bro kind of atmosphere) re: the boys and beers mentality. He also is a practicing Muslim so he spreads himself between these two different worlds; that almost seem polarising - sometimes in a good way; sometimes in a bad way. I just feel like he uses his faith and cultural background when it suits him eg participate in Ramadan and prays and goes to mosque, has home cooked meals made by his mother and can go to her house whenever he wants, which is beautiful and I’m glad he has that in his life. To contrast he seems to then go out partying doing coke and whatever else, and wanting different sexual experiences which was fine at the start. 

Obviously in their culture family comes first, however to a point of me feeling like a bottom tier priority; eg, himself, family, work & business (also tied to family obligations) friends then me squished in there somehow. At the start it wasn’t like this, it almost felt like a dream, so much attentiveness, so emotional and beautiful dates, lavish gifts and trips away…late nights, amazing sex life, lots of conversations about our lives and how things and values aligned eg wanting a family, wanting the same things. I was really impressed about how dedicated he was to his family, culture and religion and his friends. And was excited to be so welcomed by nearly all aspects of his life. 

A few months into seeing each-other he got served and immense stress came into our lives through this legal court police issue he has looming over him to do with his family business. I can’t really speak to details but it’s been incredibly stressful so since then things kind of changed - this is understandable, and he was very upfront about it to me when it all came out and I have been by his side supporting him through it. Since that happened his drinking and partying escalated but I also thought this was due to him not having that freedom to do so when he was younger due to family obligations and other financial issues. Since this has now gone a full sort of 180 as in now he has a running successful business he has gone into party mode. This was fine at the beginning as in I was willingly participating in it. We also were open ish in our relationship, we were interested in exploring sexual needs and desires via sexual experiences with others eg threesomes and when we went away I let him get happy endings etc because I thought it was kind of fun and hot. Anyway because we had this sort of arrangement in the first few months and beyond of our relationship I felt he got a little carried away with it and classically got a bit greedy and ahead of himself. 

Anyway fast forward to April, we go to meet my family for the first time and we had just gotten back from a trip in Thailand together. I had a suspicion he was getting happy endings or at least went and got one massage since we got back from our trip, which was something he was only allowed to do if he told me after. He never did and then I found out he got a massage back in Aus without telling me. I asked him on a long drive to my parents if he had and he lied to me and gaslit me. Then less than a month later he revealed it to me while we were at a party high and drunk. He also expressed a great amount of fear and loneliness about this impending court case and worried that he didn’t have the capacity for our relationship- in previous ones when this court stuff had occurred he has ended up cheating or the relationship has suffered for a myriad of issues. I assured him that we could work through it and everything would be okay. 

Months later around August/September he goes on a trip with his friends to Bali. It unfortunately ended up syncing with the timing of my beloved grandmother dying which was a big emotional thing for me - lots of trips interstate to see her in her final days which he was very supportive of. We were both so consumed with our own issues and I could see that he was getting grumpy and burnt out from work so I suggested for him and urged him to go on the trip so that he could recalibrate - even if that meant he wouldn’t be here to support me. The biggest mistake I made was not discussing with him what the trip would look like in terms of whether he wanted to see SW’s and get massages etc. so when he was on the trip he called me and asked if it was okay. I said yes. This is the conflicting issue. I okayed it because I thought it was sort of hot and I could live through his experiences in this way if he told me details about it or told me after the fact so I felt comfortable etc. but I also knew he would be influenced by his friend and would do it anyway, so I felt upon reflection that my boundaries had been violated - as in he shouldn’t have even been putting his desires first while I’m grieving and he should be able to put them aside to make sure I felt emotionally safe. I was not in a position or healthy head space to okay this but I did anyway. Then when he was away I felt incredibly anxious and insecure because he didn’t make time to call me one night I specifically asked him because I felt upset.

He didn’t get back to me all day and sent a lazy text saying hey sorry I didn’t call how are you, and I had a breakdown. I sent him a bunch of texts and he didn’t respond then I felt awful like he was avoiding me on purpose. I had a panic attack and had to call his best friends gf to ask her to tell his friend to call me and once he did he called me back and I went mental at him. I just felt so emotionally neglected. And like he was avoiding me. He explained his day and night and that was fine but I just felt a total disregard for my feelings in this situation. It was awful to put me through it and he was basically just having a fuck fest and drinking th whole time, being stupid and getting his dick wet. Made me feel sick. But I still went along with it because he’s so charming. When he would call me about his sexual experiences it was all based around his escapades and that’s about it. Which admittedly I was trying to get off on but again, upon reflection felt groomed to okay it and play along with it to some extent. 

He explained one experience to me and we spoke on the phone for about an hour about it, he seemed really scared he was going to get an std then I assured him that it would be fine and consoled him through his experience. I felt a good connection to him because he was being honest and open and I really value that. However, he ended the call really abruptly and I just thought nothing of it. Later I found out he ended it early because his friend let him have sex with the hooker he ordered and wasn’t happy with so he got off the phone to me to quickly go fuck someone else. I found out this through his friends gf because we were talking and I got really upset because I was on my way back to our city from seeing my grandma for the last time. Again, I felt a total failure on his part for letting me know and I felt like he was keeping more things from me. This was upsetting and a confronting conversation to have with him causing conflict. 

When he got back i picked him up from the airport and I had the ick. he bought me a perfume from the airport that said he got it for me because it smelled ‘slutty and whore-like’. I found this quite degrading and I was a bit disappointed and a taken back. It wasn’t a scent I would usually wear and doesn’t really suit me. When we started having sex again we had to use protection because I wanted him to get a test and this wasn’t the issue. But it was the undercurrent of the form of betrayal I felt from the whole trip where I felt he was being selfish and got carried away. We went out for a late night coffee and he started telling me about his next trip he wants to go on where he wants to go to Iran for 3 months and have a gf experience and see people. I found this offensive and said he is getting greedy and shut it down. A few weeks later I decided to have a conversation with him where I felt we needed to close our relationship off and I wanted to become monogamous to work on security and structure within our relationship. He was receptive but immature about it saying that he needs something from me too, which I asked and he said more cooking. I found this offensive and a fight broke out. We finally came to see eye to eye on it as I explained I needed more security in our relationship moving forward and for the time being I didn’t want to do anything sexual outside of the relationship. This felt like a push and go but also felt we finally got on the same page. 

To add further context he told me his parents had a breakdown in their marriage and his father has been cheating on his mother. Which was partially the reason I closed the relationship up because things were getting so messy around us. I explained even though I was grateful for his honesty and to support him through this I felt worried about their relationship impending ours in a negative way, like it setting a bad example. 

In October for my birthday we went on a trip with some of his oldest friends. The friend he went to Bali with one night wanted to one up him, they seem to have this dynamic where they openly joke about crass things and bully eachother. His friend took it too far and revealed that he had a video of my bf getting a BJ from a SW. Basically revenged porned him infront of me and some others and I just felt so triggered again. And back in that same place I felt abandoned in. I was really upset that his friend had a disregard for my feelings and found it to be so disrespectful on so many levels. We fought for a lot of the trip and I had an emotional breakdown causing stress and harm in our relationship because I felt unsafe and disrespected by not only him but his best friend. Although he was trying hard to appease me and fix it I couldn’t help but feel awful about it. I was just so upset and sad, and his best friend picked a fight with me and said he likes us both but we shouldn’t be together. 

We get back to aus and things are hard emotionally very heavy. We try and work it out but I feel myself getting very triggered by his behaviour; his activity on social media, his incessant jokes that are insensitive and immature. We try work things out slowly and I start ro feel reassured by the actions he is taking - albeit being slow and steady and we make a promise to eachother to try and meet eachother in the middle. 

Come December he starts getting excited for the possibilities of summer and starts hinting at threesomes in a subtle manner. I shut it down and my best friend comes back from Europe to visit. I’ve known her for 15 years. 

In early December one of my best friends ends his life so my whole world collapses and I spent the first week at my good friends house so we can take care of eachother and contact people who need to know about the funeral and any other finite details. It’s been a taxing time emotionally and he has tried his best to be there for me. One night I find I can spare after this news he invites me over for dinner and made this beautiful meal for us. I felt safe and relaxed and then all of a sudden he propositions me for a threesome with my best friend. He asks three times and I told him to get off me, I stood up and just was in shock and couldn’t beleive it. I said how dare you ask me something so insensitive especially right now and after everything we have been through. I drove away and was really upset. Since then we have not been okay. I was really hurt and upset and he felt bad and apologised etc. then it was his mums birthday the next night which I felt forced to go to to keep up appearances. I went to dinner begrudgingly and still really revved up from his behaviour and my friends death. We are sitting at the dinner table with his family at a restaurant and his father gifts his mum a beautiful dazzling gold piece of jewellery. I felt so angry and unsafe without thinking I blurted out toward him, ‘someone has fucked up this year’ he heard me and felt disrespected understandably so. 

We didn’t talk for a couple of days and then one night we had a really important convo on the phone where he said since that incident and the 5 or so months of the downfall of our relationship he said he now has doubts about us and doesn’t want to waste my time. I said fair enough but I can’t be held to this standard when you are the one causing the damage and it’s unfair I get blamed for my reactions to his shitty behaviour even though i was out of line with that comment. 
We had an important phone call where he said he wasn’t happy and he doesn’t want to waste my time. 

Anyway so we both have seperate Christmas plans he is going to Thailand with his family and I am seeing mine in Aus. I tried to break up with him the night before we both left but he said to give it one more chance which I agreed to but we both need to see change in our behaviour eg I will work on letting things go and forgiveness and he will be more considerate and respectful and sensitive. The trouble is I have voiced to him that I don’t think he respects me or women and it makes me feel sad. When we were out to dinner I told him I had a letter to give him explaining my feelings and our situation and some good things too about him and us. It was about 8-10 pages long. I wrapped it up with a ribbon and said I love you on the front. He told me he hadn’t gotten me anything but out of nowhere he suggested he would give me 4k to grieve for the month of Jan so I could relax. I cried and said that’s really generous. When we got to mine he changed the figure to 3k instead of 4 and I was a bit like okay? Idk. So then he leaves and doesn’t transfer me straight away. He calls me during his connecting flight and in the interim I had been driving for hours to see my family for Xmas. I was already emotionally exhausted and disappointed he hadn’t transferred me or listened to why we shouldn’t be together anymore. 

I got annoyed and said he just said he would give me the money to financially manipulate me and keep me on the hook while he decides what he wants to do with the relationship. He got annoyed and said fine I won’t do it then. I calmed down and said look let’s face it this isn’t working. Then I sent him some texts to say how I was feeling but he wasn’t understanding that I just tried to break up with him. He replies to my heartfelt messages and he says okay maybe it’s best we don’t talk and have a break and I just responded more and said he didn’t get it etc. he then tries to call again but the reception cuts out. 

So now we are here. He’s in denial I’m confused and emotionally shot to shit because of the grief im dealing with and the fact our relationship feels dismal. We text lightly today to wish eachtoher merry Xmas and I bring up that im sad he didn’t get me anything. And that I could have really used to money and it was a nice gesture because im depressed and despondent due to one of my closest friends dying. He gets annoyed because it was a nice gesture but I highlight I got upset because it felt like I was being emotionally abused which has happened in my previous relationship eg they use it against me later so ofc he hasn’t given me the money. It’s fine it’s just like don’t even do it and also you’ve had two or so weeks to think of something like that so it feels all the too convenient for him to bring it up in the middle of me saying this isn’t working. 

I feel so alone and distant and we are living different lives. He says we are incompatible but still wants to be in a relationship with me? Idk I’m so confused. Has anyone else experienced this before. I just don’t think he understands I’ve broken up with him. But it’s hard to not talk because of everything going on.

I just wanna drink a nice latte at home. 
• For context: I drink coffee every day, usually latte. My husband prefers cold brew but he usually buys it, every now and then we make it at home. I see the Ninja has the option to make more than espresso which seems interesting. Also, she mentioned the grinder thing. The coffee shop my husband goes to almost every day roasts their own coffee and I decided to get beans from them and they grind them for me, my friend said that the ninja already has a grinder and after buying a separate one the Breville would come out to be more expensive than the Ninja.

whilst he spanked his penis on her bottom.
She also had to have sexual intercourse with Clinton in Epstein’s New York Mansion just off 5th
Avenue on numerous occasions. It’s the NY Mansion we spoke about yesterday. I too was forced
by Epstein to visit regularly and if I didn’t turn up he would personally come and find me where ever
I was hiding. It still bewilders me how Epstein always seemed to know where I was if I didn’t turn up
at his NY residence. 
When my friend had sexual intercourse with Clinton, Prince Andrew and Richard Branson, sex
tapes were in fact filmed on each separate occasion by Jeffery. Thank God she managed to get a
hold of some footage of the filmed sex tapes, which clearly identify the faces of Clinton, Prince
Andrew and Branson having sexual intercourse with her. Frustratingly enough Epstein was not
seen in any of the footage but he was clever like that!
After two hours of trying to convince my friend to come forward with me, I eventually managed to
persuade her to send me some of the video footage which she kept, implicating all three all men
mentioned above. I personally can confirm that I have, with my own two eyes, seen the evidence of
these sexual acts, which clearly identifies Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Richard Branson having
sexual intercourse with my friend. I will be more then willing to swear under oath and testify in court
over these sex tapes. It will break your heart into a million tiny pieces Maureen when you watch this
footage, and I know that what I watched yesterday, will haunt me for the rest of my life!
Unfortunately, I cannot send you the footage without her consent due to massive consequences to
her safety but I can confirm that I do have footage in my possession. I have backed up the footage
on several USB sticks and have securely sent them to various different locations throughout
Europe with only one other person close to me, knowing where their locations are, just in case
anything happens to me before the footage is released.
When my friend eventually had the courage to speak out and went to the police in 2008 to report
what had happened, nothing was done and she was utterly humiliated by the police department
where she went to report what had happened with Epstein, Clinton, Branson and Prince Andrew.
She was made to feel like a dirty whore and a liar and wasn’t taken seriously.  When she then tried
to sue Epstein for damages, she was severely bullied and threatened by his lawyer Alan
Dershowitz whom she also had sexual relations with and who was also heavily involved in
Epstein's paedophile  Ring.
A couple months later, she was then approached, by Special Agents Forces Men sent directly by
Hilary Clinton herself, in order to protect her presidential campaign in 2008. They heavily
intimidated her, ruffled her up (luckily she took photos as evidence) and was then forced to sign a
confidentiality agreement which ensures that she can never come forward publicly implicating her
husband.
She was then given a substantial payout, directly from the Clinton Foundation to keep her quiet.
She is 1000% certain that the FBI did a cover up and she has the individual names of Hilary’s
Special Agent Officers involved in intimidating her. She was then forced against her will to sign a
legally binding confidentially agreement on Hilary’s behalf for her eternal silence.  If she breaks this
agreement, she is dead.
She told me how it was a complete conspiracy as Alan Dershowitz, whom was one of the lawyers
that represented Jeffery when he went to trail, made huge endorsements to the Clinton Foundation
to help fund her 2008 presidential campaign.
I personally met Alan numerous times as Jeffery had sent him to my legal aid, to deal with a case I
was going to open against 
 whom I met through the website SugarDaddie.com (he went under the name 
 the site). 
 also tried to rape me with his friend when we were at anchor on
his boat in Miami.

several girls at any one time.  She confided in me about her casual “friendship"""" with Donald. Mr
Trump definitely seemed to have a thing for her and she told me how he kept going on about how
he liked her """"pert nipples”.
Donald Trump liked flicking and sucking her nipples until they were raw. One evening when we
were showering together she showed me her nipples.  They looked incredibly painful as they were
red and swollen and I remember wincing when I looked at them.  I also know she had sexual
relations with Trump at Jeffery’s NY mansion on regular occasions as I once met Jen for coffee,
just before she was going to meet Trump and Epstein together at his mansion.
I will shortly start forwarding you, all the emails which I have managed to save. They include the
following:
 I moved from Edinburgh to
New York in September 2006, where shortly after I was introduced to Jeffery Epstein by Natalie.
. A couple months later, after he constantly stalked me around
Edinburgh, I moved to New York to get as far away from him as possible and to start a new life.
I will send you that photo, amongst others as soon as I am able to fly back to the UK next week as I
definitely, 100% have it all in my little storage box. I also have other photo’s of the Epstein girls and
I, whilst on the Island including a couple of pictures of me with Sergey Brin and his then finance
Anne Wojcicki. I met the pair when they visited the Island for the day as Sergey wanted try out his
new kite surfing equipment as he had only just started kite surfing and was very eager to try out his
new equipment with us girls.
In my secret box, I also have old sim cards which still contain old text messages and telephone
numbers which I will have to send you next week once I have them. Hopefully Jens number will be
there and I can trace her somehow, surely?
* Email exchanges with Sarah Kellen which includes flight tickets booked for me to St Thomas.
*Email exchanges with Lesley Groff ,which proves that I was asked to source girls from modelling
agencies when I went home to see my family in Cape Town. How Jeffery used education as a way
for me to trade my soul to the Devil and become a sex slave to pay for my studies at FIT in New
York.
I was desperate to get qualified and get a proper career. The email also show's evidence that I had
to become almost anorexic for Jeffery to even entertain the idea of him paying for my tuition. As
you will see, Lesley Groff asked me to send her a picture for Jeffery.
I would like to point out that I had to regularly send nude photo's to Lesley so that Jeffery could
check how my body looked and if I was putting on any weight.
* An email which was exchanged between 
 using his code name 
via Sugar Daddie.com. I have other correspondence which I had with him in my storage box in
England.
* Email exchanges between the girl Natalie Malyshev whom received funds from Jeffery for
introducing me to him.

I do all that but because they're not specific on what exactly and how I should do it perhaps that's why it doesn't help as much or I need more than that. I even started drinking chamomile tea. I probably should stop drinking coffee but can't make it throughout the day without it. Any tips from you guys? Yeah I should prioritize my sleep which is difficult bc my roommates don't sleep and yell and laugh until like 1am or sth and I'm too anxious and shy to tell them to stfu let me sleep. This is basically a neverending cycle. ",3,1766659000.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

Posting anonymously. I’m not here to blame anyone — I just want to share this to feel lighter and move forward with clarity.

I’m a 20M first-semester college student who formed a deep emotional bond with a 19F classmate. She is already in a committed relationship, and I’ve known that from the beginning. I genuinely believe she’s innocent and not playing with me — it feels less like manipulation and more like two people unintentionally crossing emotional lines.

A small but important backstory:  
When we first met, I was the one resisting. I thought her warmth was just casual affection. I was busy with academics, playing guitar, participating in college events, and didn’t want to misread anything. When she first asked me to go for coffee, I said no. Later, I felt bad — not romantically, but humanly — that someone was trying sincerely just to be friends with me. That’s when I asked her instead.

What made our bond different was the kind of conversations we had. We talked a lot about ambitions, studies, goals, and life direction — not just romance. For her, this was probably new: someone to discuss growth and purpose with rather than surface-level romance. That’s likely why the connection deepened naturally.

We also come from very different worlds. She’s from a small village and hasn’t experienced much yet. I had a flashy life before, but most of it disappeared due to family problems and circumstances beyond my control. We’re still struggling to rebuild. That contrast made even small moments feel significant — like eating simple Maggi together, or sitting and drinking a cold drink while I saw her eyes fill with water, quietly holding something back. There was no drama — just a shared emotional weight.

Over time, emotional intimacy grew — daily conversations, flirting, physical closeness like holding hands, and comfort that created attachment. She shared personal photos (not explicit, but intimate enough), and often prioritized spending time with me.

Some moments that blurred lines:

* Once, casually, I referred to us meeting as a “one-sided date.” She didn’t shut it down — she just laughed.
* We went on a bike ride together once for shopping, spending time alone in a way that felt more than platonic.
* She told me she shares many of these things with her boyfriend, which made it feel acknowledged yet unresolved.

She knows I’m emotionally attached and that I have feelings. I’ve been honest about that. At the same time, she clearly says she can’t move forward because she’s loyal to her partner. So nothing becomes official — but the closeness never really stops.

The cycle I got stuck in:  
After spending time together, my insecurities surface. I overthink my place in her life, feel emotionally overwhelmed, and sometimes end up fighting with her. These fights don’t come from anger or control — they come from confusion.

What’s strange is that after every fight, instead of distancing, our bond becomes stronger. We talk it out, understand each other more, and grow even closer. Recently, she’s tried to act more “normal” and maintain some distance — but she also breaks that resistance at times, pulling me back into emotional warmth.

I don’t think she’s doing this intentionally. I think we both underestimated how powerful emotional closeness can be when timing and boundaries don’t align.

Why I’m stepping back now:  
I’m choosing distance not because she’s wrong, but because the situation is hurting me. We’re currently in our semester exams, and after that she’ll be going home. Maybe she’ll miss me, maybe she won’t. I won’t deny that a part of me hopes she does — but I can’t live on that hope.

For now, I’m focusing on my exams and regaining emotional balance. I’m sharing this here to let it go and move forward.

I just want to know similar stories and how things should move now?

Our story is much similar to the show ""The Office"". My instincts tell me that she loves me. The thing is that she is just occupied romantically only.

I think the best partner is with whom your ambitions match.  
There is a lot of idealism in this situation. I am uncertain about the future.

I never lied to her that “we’ll just be friends,” because deep down I knew that wasn’t fully true. I’ve always been honest about my thoughts, even if it’s just a tiny 0.1% chance I feel we could be more. The odds of even meeting her were almost zero — I’m from a different state, moved here because of family problems, and never expected this to happen. So when we did meet, how could I not allow myself to intentionally expect the unexpected this time?

1pvamxq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pvamxq,"Can't figure out how to add in a work zone, please help","Hi everyone! I'm turning quite desperate now.

I’m trying to rearrange my living room to fit three things: a comfortable TV area, a small work zone, and a coffee corner.  
The last photos show how the room looked before I moved in (the soft couch is gone now - it’s a bed in another room).

This is the best layout I’ve managed so far, but there are two problems:

* the sun hits my face directly when I work, and my eyes get tired pretty fast
* in most other realistic layouts, the TV ends up in the corner, which makes movie watching pretty bad

Does anyone see a better arrangement or have ideas I might be missing?
