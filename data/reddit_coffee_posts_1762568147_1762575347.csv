There's plenty of beginner guides over in the r/cigars wiki and other places, but it can be intimidating to start in a country where the community is smaller and the regulations high. 

If you're one of those visitors, just starting out with cigars in Australia, and need a crash course addressing the absolute bare bones basics, I hope this post is useful. If you're a long term community member, please let me know if there's anything I've missed (or if you have a different viewpoint to share). 

# You are in control of your own enjoyment

In this country, this hobby is going to cost you money. We don't have the luxury of cheap available cigars. How you rationalise it is up to you. 

Personally, I look at it this way: I can spend $10 to cook a good meal at home, or $60 to eat out. I can spend $10 on snacks and stream a movie at home, or I can watch a movie in Gold Class and easily be out $80 on ticket and food by the time I come out. I can also spend $50-60 on a cigar I can sit in my backyard and smoke with a book or audiobook for 90 minutes. 

None of that money is wasted - provided you have the means to afford it, and that's what you take your enjoyment from. You do you. 

# Where to buy your first cigar

When you're just starting out, get to a [good local cigar vendor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigars_Australia/wiki/index/buying-cigars-in-australia/) if you have one available to you. Being able to walk in and discuss your personal experiences and tastes with a good seller that can make recommendations to you can't be beat. Avoid going to the corner store tobacconist, IGA, etc. unless you know they know what they're doing - more often than not, the cigar selection will be slim to none, and they won't have been stored properly. 

If you don't have that luxury or availability, the next best bet is [buying online from an Australian vendor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigars_Australia/wiki/index/buying-cigars-in-australia/). This means that you'll have to do your own research to try and pick something you might like. Alternatively, you could give one of the vendors a call or shoot them a message online. I haven't done this myself but I can't see a good vendor refusing to help you over the phone or by message/email. 

In my view, when first starting out, you're better off buying locally (even if it's more expensive) than dealing with the [gauntlet of buying overseas, dealing with the ABF letter, etc](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigars_Australia/wiki/index/impo/). 

# What cigar(s) to buy first

This is where it's really beneficial to talk to a good vendor who can curate what may be best for you to start with - or, if you aren't able to do that, to do your own research in advance. 

Like anything, cigars are a matter of personal taste. It also involves chemicals - such as nicotine - that you may not have experience with before. There's plenty of stories of people getting sick off their first cigar for various reasons, or being turned off because their first cigar was offered to them by a more experienced smoker and so on the stronger side. So don't be disappointed if you weren't happy with your first cigar, as it may take trying a couple of different cigars before you really get your preferences and your technique down. If your budget stretches far enough, consider [buying a sampler](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigars_Australia/comments/1o4otzp/what_would_be_in_your_personal_300_sampler/) \- preferably one that provides a sample of cigars from a range of different brands, so you're not being exposed to only one brand.

Your best bet is to pick cigars lighter in flavour and body (note that strength has nothing to do with the colour of the cigar). Yes, this means that it might not be very interesting when you first start out, but it's better to start with something mellow and work your way up until you find your preferred strength, rather than starting at the top and having your teeth kicked in by a spice-and-nicotine bomb. 

Similarly, it's safer to start with smaller sizes, say around 5 inches (you'll hear terms like 'robusto' or 'petit corona' for this size cigar) or a lancero (a longer cigar up to around 7.5 inches, but skinny). Any of them should last you around an hour, give or take. That gives you a good taste of what the cigar is like, without being stuck for too long or so much that nicotine sickness starts to catch up on you. You might think 'but the bigger size is only a little bit more money and so better value!' or be disappointed because you wanted the experience of smoking a honking great stogie, but in this case it's a false economy. You don't want to be stuck smoking a cigar you don't like for 2 hours, tossing half of it away, or (worst case) getting too sick to continue. Patience, grasshopper - the bigger cigars will be waiting for you when you're ready, if that's where your tastes lead you.

[Don't make the mistake of rushing out to buy every cigar under the sun, or boxes of things. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigars_Australia/comments/1om8fbo/so_you_want_to_build_a_cigar_collection/)This is an easy path for ending up with a lot of cigars you don't want. Cigars are too expensive in Australia for that. Work out what you like first, and go from there. 

# Cheap vs expensive cigars

Cigars are not cheap in Australia. 

However, this is where our experience starts varying widely from overseas experiences and reviews, and we start seeing some odd 'benefits'. When overseas reviewers talk about 'good' cigars versus 'much better' or 'premium' cigars, they could be talking cigars which for them cost 200% or more. For us, because our local taxes are so high, the price difference between the 'good' end and the 'much higher' end is often much narrower. (In fact, you can occasionally find Cuban cigars that are cheaper in Australia than overseas!)

Here are some examples. 

* Brick House cigars are generally considered to be good, reliable, and affordable. At least for our US friends. You can grab a Robusto for $7.60 USD from Neptune today. That same cigar is $49.70 AUD from The Index.
* Compare that to a Davidoff Winston Churchill Petit Corona. Davidoff is one of the more premium brands. For our US friends, that cigar is $15.90 USD - more than double the cost of the Brick House. That same cigar is $48.30 from The Index - *cheaper* than the Brick House (although admittedly the Brick House is a bigger cigar and so has more tax).
* Looking way up market at the extreme premium end, is something like an Opus X - a highly in-demand and expensive cigar no matter where you are. At Neptune, an Opus X Angels Share Double Corona (a very big and high-end cigar) is going to cost you $46.41 USD, or around $71.50 AUD (and that's even if they have them in stock, which they currently don't). That's 6x the cost of the Brick House. You can buy the same cigar from Cigar Hut for $114 AUD. Yes, that's expensive, but it's only 2.3x the price of the Brick House locally. Relatively speaking - based on local prices - we're getting a better deal than the Americans are.  

That doesn't mean you should only buy 'premium' brands to the exclusion of all other things - just to factor it in as one of the things to think about when buying. If you try a Brick House and decide you like it, then stick with Brick House. No one worth caring about is going to shame you for buying what you like. 

Cigars are expensive enough locally as it is. If you're going to spend money, spend it wisely. 

# Cigar accessories and storage

You'll need at least the basic accessories and storage to get started. For now, leave the fancy humidors and lighters, the AliExpress savings, etc. to the side. Focus on the cigars first. You can get the fancier (or cheaper) stuff later, after you've had a chance to decide whether this is something you want to continue with. 

Here's the highlight reel.

To smoke your cigar, you'll need a **cutter**, a **butane (jet) lighter**, and an **ashtray**. For the time being, just pick something cheap and serviceable from your vendor. The fancy stuff can wait. 

If you have multiple cigars and need to store them, get an **airtight container** (like a Sistema with the rubber seal) of appropriate size from somewhere like Woolworths / Coles / K-Mart / etc. This is your new **tupperdor** (tupperware + humidor). 

In your tupperdor, along with your cigars, you will want some **Boveda** (humidity packs) which you can get from your cigar vendor (I also believe some other brands may be available from chemists). General rule of thumb is at least one 60g Boveda per 25 cigars that your tupperdor can fit by volume. 

For cigar storage, you can get Boveda in 62%, 65%, and 69% humidity packs (other %'s are available for things like humidor seasoning, hygrometer testing, musical instrument storage, etc.). If you decide cigars are for you and stick with it, you can educate yourself then about the great humidity wars and what % humidity is best for Cuban vs non-Cuban cigars, for smoking vs storage, etc. My *personal* recommendation - which I'm sure won't be contentious and I won't be destroyed for in the comments at all (/s) - is to go with 65% for now as a middle ground. This minimises the risk of going too low, and also minimises the risk of you having a couple of really hot days where the % inside your tupperdor gets pushed to 70%+ (where you start getting risk of mould) and the Boveda can't keep up.

In these conditions, in a tupperdor, your Boveda should last at least a couple of months. I've had some last well over a year. If you feel your Boveda and it is clearly dry or drying up, it's time to replace it. 

Store your tupperdor somewhere where the temperature will be relatively stable and not exposed to too much/any sun, like a wardrobe or bedroom closet. 

# Smoking your first cigar(s)

There's plenty of guides around how to smoke your first cigar - cutting, puffing not inhaling, etc. r/cigars has [some good beginner guides in their wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/wiki/smokingbasics/). On YouTube, [Holt's has a Cigar 101 on how to smoke your first cigar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpshJW1psfg). I'm not going to repeat these and all the other guides, other than making these few comments. 

You'll read a lot about flavour notes (and whether they exist). This comes down to your personal palate. When just starting out, don't be surprised if you can't say anything other than ""I liked that cigar"" or ""I didn't like that cigar"". The flavours are subtle and conveyed through smoke not substance. So don't expect the taste of a Cadbury: expect the taste you get when you smell chocolate. Don't expect the taste of a long black: expect the taste you get from the aroma of coffee. Don't think about the taste of leather (has anyone ever actually eaten leather?): think about the smell of good leather. When we talk about 'flavours', it's these subtle olfactory flavours we're talking about, not the flavours we'd get if we were eating the thing we're talking about. It'll come to you in time. 

Flavour can also be impacted a lot by what you pair with the cigar. You'll read a lot about cigar pairings. Usually, this means food and drink. Some people like pairing their cigar with coffee or a soft drink like a Coke, nibbles like nuts or chocolate, or alcoholic drinks. You may find as you go that you like pairing different things with your cigars. Have a look at reviews, but pick the pairings that you like for your own palate as you explore.

Another pairing, maybe less discussed but no less important, is what else you're doing while having a cigar. You may treat it like a meditative moment where you simply do nothing but smoke your cigar for an hour. Many people will pair their cigar with a book they're reading (physical or electronic), or music or an audiobook. Some people may even have some other activity or hobby that they can work on while they have their cigar, and return for a puff periodically as they work. If you're really lucky, you may even have a companion interested to experience cigars with you, which can really elevate the experience: a common theme in the cigar community is ""*there's no such thing as a bad cigar in good company*"".

Try you cigars with different pairings and see how it changes your experience. 

# Nicotine sickness

Nicotine sickness is quite literally the poisoning effect that too much nicotine has on the body. It often takes one of two forms (or both): a general queasiness (dizziness, nausea, etc.) while smoking, or a headache which can develop hours later. Even experienced smokers can encounter nicotine sickness in some circumstances. 

If you want to minimise your changes of feeling this way, or find yourself experiencing these, here are some ways the cigar community has suggested to minimise the effects or the chances of it happening again:

* Smoke on a full stomach e.g. after a meal.
* Ensure that you are well hydrated (with water - not alcohol) before, during, and after, smoking your cigar.
* Have light snacks available while smoking. Have something sugary throughout (e.g. a real full-fat soft drink - not diet or zero). Alternatively (or additionally), if you find yourself starting to feel queasy, have something sugary like chocolate, or even take a half teaspoon of sugar straight under the tongue. Sugar can help counteract the effects of nicotine sickness.
* Make sure you are puffing your cigar, not inhaling your cigar. Inhaling introduces more nicotine into your system.
* Slow down how quickly you are smoking your cigar. A good target is one puff every minute. If it goes out, just relight it.
* Don't smoke too close to bedtime. Have at least some time between finishing your cigar and sleep. Have something to eat between finishing your cigar and sleep.
* Panadol, ibuprofen, etc. exist.
* Consider smoking smaller cigars or cigars that aren't as strong. Build up a tolerance first.

# Buying for an event

Some people's first experience with a cigar - whether buying or smoking - is related to an event, like a bachelor party, You may be reading this trying to buy for just that event.

I don't have any specific experience for planning cigars for an event. All I'd have to say is to remind you that your event may be the first time that many of the people there will have experienced a cigar, and to plan accordingly. 

* Err on the side of lighter cigars over stronger ones (no one needs Great Aunt Hortense vomiting in the bush at the wedding reception). 
* Store them in an airtight container until ready to distribute.
* Have plenty of ashtrays, lighters, cutters, etc. Expect not all of them to return, or that some people may not want to use them after a while (for some reason, some people like slobbering over their cigar *then* using a communal cutter - no thank you).
* Offer plenty of food, hydration, etc. to counteract potential nicotine sickness.

This is where a discussion with a proper vendor can really help you, as they'll be able to point you in the direction of a cigar that will be accessible to the largest number of people.

# You are in control of your own enjoyment

As you read up, you're going to come across a lot of what boils down to cigar pretentiousness. 

People will argue endlessly about what the appropriate humidity for the cigar is, whether you should use a soft flame lighter versus a jet lighter, what you should pair with your cigars, whether you should smoke the cigar down to the nub or stop when the flame gets to the band (or even earlier), etc. 

My personal view (and I think the ultimate view of the majority of us) is that you should smoke the cigar the way you like, so long as you're not doing something gross (no slobbering on your cigar and then using a shared cutter, no spitting in public, no putting non-ash rubbish in the shared ashtray, etc.). 

* Do you find that you prefer a jet lighter than a yellow flame? No complaints here. 
* Do you like to dry box your cigar before smoking? That's fair. 
* Do you want to smoke the cigar right down to the point you're burning your fingers? I hope it was a good cigar.
* Do you want to cover your cigar in tequila then smoke it [like Arnold Schwarzenegger does](https://www.cigaraficionado.com/video/JnQmHwt9/arnold-schwarzenegger-combines-tequila-with-a-cigar)? I'm going to judge you on the inside, but go ahead if that's what you like. 

You worked hard. You bought the cigar. It's yours now. Enjoy cigars the way that you want to. You do you.

MY DEAREST LILY.

They met freshman year of college. She was the daughter raised on rules, expectations, “reputation,” and a father who never let her think freely. He was the scholarship boy who lived off cheap coffee and dreams bigger than the town they lived in. Their love was messy, wild, too intense, and absolutely real. And every night she would talk about her perfect dream: “someday I just want my own little café — where I can make people feel safe.” They planned it out together. The colors, the plants, the bookshelves, the name.

But one summer — without warning — she disappeared. Her father forced her to leave the relationship. He took her phone, her access to money, her independence and claimed her future would be “ruined” if she stayed with that boy. He told her she was making a fool of herself. And she obeyed — believing she was protecting that boy by letting go. What she never knew was this: Her father intercepted every letter, every email, every voicemail that boy sent. The boy begged to know what he did wrong and got silence. She waited for him to fight for her and got silence. Both of them thought the other one simply chose to stop loving.

⸻

Years passed.

She is older now and engaged to a wealthy man who looks like the perfect pick on paper. He’s handsome, polished, well-bred — the ideal choice her father approves of. But privately, this man is emotionally abusive. He convinces her everything is her fault. He calls her sensitive. He isolates her. He breaks her down without ever “hitting"" her. She has learned to apologize for breathing wrong.

Meanwhile… him

That boy from college stayed in that old college town. He worked jobs, barely slept, saved every cent. And then he built the café she once described down to the smallest detail. Same cozy lights. Same brick wall with books. Same old mismatched chairs. The café is literally built from her dream. He even named the café after her. Every morning when he unlocks the door he silently hopes that someday… she would find it.

until one random day… she does. She returns to town on a short trip with her fiancé — and sneaks out one morning to just walk. She sees a café with her name on it and freezes. She steps in. And the man behind the counter looks up — Her old boyfriend. The love she lost with no goodbye. Their eyes lock and both of them feel the years slam back into their chests. He notices instantly: the way she flinches when someone bumps her shoulder the way she talks softly like she doesn’t want to take up space the anxious fidgeting with her fingers He recognizes trauma on her immediately.

She notices that his entire life — this café — is literally built out of her dream, which leads to her running from it all and not being able to believe it all really happened when she's engaged now.. like he was trying to last minute convince her when she's engaged and everything! Its pouring outside and after they exchange some brutal words of her blaming him and yelling at him after he's closed for never writing her, never trying to reach out until she runs out into the rain and he catches her yelling himself that he wrote her everyday for a year, 365 letters everyday for one year.. and it all sets in.. he never forget her, her father must've hid them and he was waiting for her that entire time.. and all the pain hits her and she runs off and after looking for her he can't find her until she slowly starts showing up at the cafe everyday just ordering something.. noticing sometimes she even removes her ring before coming in.. their connection and forbidden love starts all over again doing things behind closed doors like teenagers all over again.",1,1762574808.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

1orfhek,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1orfhek/how_to_reset_your_dopamine_receptors_without/,How to reset your dopamine receptors (without quitting modern life or becoming a monk),"It's wild how many people I know who feel ""blah"" all the time. Like, nothing feels exciting anymore. Not food, not work, not even doomscrolling. Just a weird numbness. It’s not burnout exactly, just… flatness. And I kept hearing the same thing over and over: “I think my dopamine is broken.”  

Turns out, dopamine *isn’t* brokenfbut the system that regulates it is totally overstimulated. We’re surrounded by hyper-rewarding content 24/7, our apps are engineered like slot machines, and even our goals chase instant gratification. The problem isn’t you. It’s how modern life hijacks your brain. And most of the online advice? Either pseudo-scientific nonsense from gym bros or extreme dopamine detox methods that pretty much want you to live in the woods with no phone, no sugar, no fun.  

This post is a science-backed, no-BS guide on how to reset and *retrain* your dopamine system, not by cutting everything out, but by working with your brain’s actual wiring. Everything here comes from solid research, top books, smart podcasts, and better tools. Not from TikTok ""experts"" yelling about ice baths and cutting out coffee forever.

The starting point is understanding how dopamine actually works. It’s not just the “pleasure” chemical. It’s more like your brain’s internal hype man. It drives motivation, learning, and habit formation. Dr. Anna Lembke (author of **Dopamine Nation**, Stanford psychiatrist) calls dopamine the “universal currency” of human pleasure. But she also warns that chronic overexposure, scrolling, snacking, binging, spikes our dopamine levels so frequently that the brain compensates by downregulating dopamine receptors. In short: you need more stimulation to feel the same reward.

The goal isn’t to eliminate dopamine, but to **rebalance** how and when you get it. Here’s what helps:

**Delayed gratification builds stronger motivation systems.** One of the best deep dives on this is from Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist, Stanford) on his podcast. He explains how waiting to reward yourself, after tasks, workouts, or learning sessions, can increase baseline dopamine response. Basically, doing hard things *before* getting a hit of pleasure makes that reward even more potent and satisfying.

**Reduce friction, don't go full detox.** You don’t need to delete every app or quit everything cold turkey. Change how you interact with them. Set phone timers *before* you scroll. Put junk food out of sight, not necessarily out of the house. Make the high-dopamine stuff slightly harder to access and make low-dopamine, high-return activities easier to access. James Clear’s **Atomic Habits** shows that behavior change hinges on small friction adjustments, not willpower.

**Replace passive binging with active novelty.** Dopamine desires novelty, but if you only feed it TikTok and potato chips, it gets bored fast. Try learning something weirdly niche. The brain loves curiosity-based learning. According to research from UC Davis Center for Neuroscience, curiosity activates the same dopamine networks as gambling or sugar, but also improves memory and intrinsic motivation.

**Train your baseline dopamine with effort-based habits.** Dr. Kelly McGonigal’s book **The Joy of Movement** (Stanford health psychologist) shows that regular physical movement, especially rhythmic and moderate-intensity, trains your brain to produce dopamine more consistently, *without* overloading it. So walking, dancing, swimming, those aren’t just fitness tips. They literally reset brain sensitivity.

**Make discomfort desirable.** The book **Dopamine Nation** dives into something fascinating: our brains work best in a cycle of pain then pleasure. The more you lean into controlled discomfort (cold showers, hard workouts, deep work), the more sensitive you are to dopamine spikes afterward. But if you always chase comfort, pleasure starts to feel meh. It’s not masochism, it’s regulation.

Now if you want resources that help structure all of this into something sustainable, not another willpower challenge, here are a few that changed everything for me:

**Atomic Habits by James Clear**  
This #1 NYT bestseller is probably the most digestible and practical breakdown of behavioral science out there. Clear doesn’t waste time on motivation fluff. He shows how to make habits obvious, easy, and satisfying, basically hacking your dopamine loops in a healthy way. This book isn’t about being perfect. It’s about reprogramming the reward system in your brain, one small cue at a time. This is the best book I’ve ever read on designing a life where dopamine actually works *for* you.

**The Joy of Movement by Kelly McGonigal**  
Don’t scroll past because it sounds like another basic fitness book. It’s not. This book got rave reviews for a reason. McGonigal explains the neuroscience of movement and why exercise boosts mood, focus, and long-term reward sensitivity. It’s filled with stories and science that make you want to move, not because you “should,” but because it literally feels good again. An insanely good read for anyone who feels stuck or numb.

**Feel Better, Live More (Podcast)** by Dr. Rangan Chatterjee  
This is like a masterclass in accessible behavioral health. Dr. Chatterjee brings on tons of experts, from neuroscientists to monks, and they always talk about real, small life changes, not aspirational BS. Look for episodes with Lembke, Huberman, or BJ Fogg for some of the most actionable dopamine advice out there.

**Finch App**  
Instead of just tracking habits, this app gamifies your self-care by turning each task into emotional rewards. You raise a cute little bird avatar by doing tasks like journaling, walking, or meditating. But unlike social media, this uses your dopamine for good. Super addictive in the best way. Helps you rebuild motivation loops in a fun, gentle way.

**BeFreed**  
This app seriously changed the game for me. Built by a team from Columbia University, it takes complicated ideas, books, expert talks, research, and turns them into personalized podcast-like lessons based on your learning goals. You can pick the tone or voice of your guide, choose how long you want to go deep (10, 20, or 40 mins), and it *adapts* to your progress, building a legit study plan. I discovered almost all the books I recommended earlier straight through their dopamine-focused learning tracks. Perfect if you want to reset your motivation *without* reading 50 neuroscience papers. The adaptive roadmap actually helps you apply what you learn instead of forgetting it after one listen.

There’s no silver bullet fix for dopamine dysfunction. But when you stop chasing the quick hits and let your brain explore, struggle, move, and learn, it starts to heal. You learn to look forward to doing hard things again. Pleasure becomes pleasure again. The numbness lifts.",1,1762574131.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

She’s always been incredibly kind to me — buying me coffee before work, carrying my bag home when my knee was injured, and always refusing when I tried to pay her back.

She recently changed fields and is struggling financially on casual work. She’s told me she sometimes skips meals or lives on instant noodles. I’ve always told her she can come to me if she needs help, and that I’m genuinely happy to support her.

Two years ago, for her birthday, I gave her a $200 multi-store gift card so she could buy essentials without feeling awkward. But ever since then, she hasn’t wished me a happy birthday. I never expect gifts from my friends — I genuinely only want their time — but I’m worried I might have unintentionally offended her because money can be sensitive.

With my other friends, we don’t stress about who pays — we just take turns. 
But with Sarah, whenever I pay, she gets upset. Recently we went for lunch; I paid, she paid for dessert. A while later we bought a huge cookie, and I paid without thinking. She refused to eat her half, saying, “You paid, so it’s yours.” It was a huge cookie so I felt sick halfway, and she still wouldn’t share it — she threw it out instead.

She’s a really kind person overall, so I’m confused and wondering if I’ve done something wrong??

anyways, we went out to our usual bar to play pool/darts since we were both bored. we got there and started with a game of pool and during one of her shots, 3 men all in their 50’s, maybe even 60’s crowded around her to explain to her how to make the shot successfully, with one getting super close up behind her. she’s a very sweet and confident girl and i think very early into meeting her, i could tell she is okay with, and even sometimes enjoys male attention and likes to go on dates whenever a guy asks, i wasn’t worried about stepping in and even if i was going to step in, the “the bigger and uglier friend always protecting/hiding the attractive friend” stigma always stops me and i never want to come across as jealous. a few guys came and went after some conversations with her but after only a few drinks, she was quite drunk. i only had a single and was starting to sober up soon into our hang out which was intentional because i am always the driver. she said she wanted another drink and i told her id go up to the bar with her so i could pay for the one drink i got. before we did that, she kept asking me “should i ask a guy to buy it for me because i don’t have much money left.” when she had already persuaded a guy earlier for quarters for our dart game. i told her she can do it if she’d like to but don’t include me in on it. im very insecure with how i look and to be completely honest, i always automatically assume that no men find me attractive since ive had men start conversations with me to smooth their way over to a friend i went with. we got up to the bar and as we waited for the bartender to get to us, she leans over to an older man (again, in his 50’s) and says “you should buy my friend as i’s drinks!” to which i tapped her arm and said “no, stop.” and the man seemed bothered and said “i think you’ll be okay.” to which she says “okay, but make sure when YOU buy drinks, tip the bartender.” and he replied “yeah trust me, i do.” i was sure she was done talking to him especially after i expressed my discomfort, but after a minute she doubled down asking this man once again, to buy our drinks and i had to really raise my voice and ask her to please stop. the man pointed out to her that i was uncomfortable and once again, that she’ll be okay without his help. we finally got the bartenders attention and did what we needed to do. she wanted to go to another bar but that specific place didn’t open for another 2 hours and i was ready to head home at this point. it was a very quiet drive back to her house and we’ve texted tonight since this happened, but i am very much a people pleaser and feel guilty about the incident. i haven’t had to set anything straight with her like that yet but her lifelong best friend who works with her at the same coffee shop has told me before that she’s had some problems with her being too comfortable when talking to men/asking them to accommodate her wants.

1orfblr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1orfblr/achievable_connections_building_confidence/,Achievable Connections: Building Confidence Without the BS,"The dating world can feel like a brutal competition, where some people seem to have all the advantages while others are left on the sidelines. You might feel like you're reaching for something just out of grasp, facing rejection after rejection. This guide offers a different path: a form of social judo that uses the dynamics of the dating world to create positive momentum. We're not asking you to settle, but to strategically seek achievable connections—opportunities to practice and build confidence where success is most likely. There's a timeless wisdom in seeking connection where it's genuinely offered, often among people overlooked by superficial standards. This isn't calculated exploitation; it's strategic compassion: everyone deserves connection, and some of the best beginnings start where you least expect.

# I. Reality Check: Understanding Your Current Position

Let's be honest: the superficial ""0-10"" attractiveness scale exists. People use it, consciously or not. This isn't a moral judgment—it's a diagnostic tool. If you perceive yourself as a ""3"" and you're only approaching ""8s"" and ""9s,"" you're setting yourself up for constant rejection, which further erodes your confidence.

Here's the pragmatic truth: **you can only date people who want to date you.** Right now, if you lack experience and confidence, that limits your options. Until you build those skills, you're most likely to find mutual interest with:

1. People facing similar or greater social hurdles (what you might call ""lower on the scale"")
2. The occasional rare, kind, confident person who sees past superficial markers (higher on the scale)

The second type can't be sought out effectively—and perhaps isn't much deserved unless you're cultivating that same generous attitude yourself. So we focus on the first: achievable connections.

# II. The Strategy: Start Where Success Is Most Likely

**Acknowledge your current reality**: Your primary obstacle isn't that you're inherently unlovable. It's that you lack practice, confidence, and social momentum. These are *solvable problems*.

**Reframe the initial goal**: You're not looking for your soulmate or a ""10"" right now. The goal is simpler:

* Have a pleasant, low-pressure interaction
* Build confidence through successful social experiences
* Learn how to date in a safe, forgiving environment

**Seek a favorable social gradient**: Look for people who are also hungry for positive connection and may face similar challenges. This isn't ""settling""—it's being realistic about where mutual interest is most likely to exist right now.

**The foundation is mutual benefit**: You're offering genuine attention and respect to someone who may rarely receive it. In return, you gain the experience you desperately need. Both people should leave the interaction feeling better than when they arrived.

**Aim to be the exception**: Sometimes a confident, kind person reaches across the perceived ""gap"" to connect with someone overlooked. As you build confidence, aim to be that person for others—like you're practicing here.

# III. How To Do It (This Week)

**Pick low-stakes settings:**

* Coffee shop or casual café
* A walk in a park
* Hobby meetup or beginner class
* Board game night
* Museum or bookstore browse

**Where to find achievable connections:**

* Join hobby-based clubs or classes (pottery, language learning, hiking groups)
* Volunteer organizations
* Community events and meetups
* Host a small game night and invite acquaintances
* Online dating, but be selective and realistic in who you message

**Make the ask clear and kind:**

* ""I'd enjoy a low-pressure hang—just coffee and conversation, no expectations.""
* ""Would you like to join me for \[activity\]? Just looking for pleasant company.""

**Keep it simple:**

* One hour maximum for first meeting
* Public place
* One activity
* Clear start and end time

# IV. The Guardrails: An Ethical Checklist

This strategy only works if you maintain absolute respect. Your goal is to create a positive interaction for *both* people.

**☐ The Principle of Transparency (Clear Intentions)**

* Be clear about the *type* of connection: ""I'm looking to meet new people for casual dates and see what develops.""
* Never promise a future you don't intend to offer
* Don't say you want something serious if you're primarily seeking experience

**☐ The Principle of Presence (Genuine Attention)**

* When you're with them, be *with* them. Phone away.
* Listen to understand, not just to reply
* Ask questions. Be curious about their life, interests, opinions
* Avoid the rescuer dynamic—you're equals sharing time

**☐ The Principle of Reciprocity (Mutual Benefit)**

* The core test: *Did they have a good time?*
* Find something to genuinely appreciate about them and compliment it sincerely
* Never act superior or condescending. Pity is an insult.

**☐ The Principle of Kind Closure (Respectful Endings)**

* Never ghost
* If no romantic match: ""Thank you for the coffee. I really enjoyed our conversation, but I don't think we're a romantic match. I wish you all the best.""
* If you offer friendship, mean it. Don't use it as a hollow consolation prize.

# V. The Growth Loop

**After each interaction**, spend 5 minutes journaling:

* Three things that went well
* One thing to improve next time
* One follow-up action (thank them, schedule next outing, etc.)

**Iterate weekly**: Aim for one new interaction per week minimum. This builds momentum.

**Gradually expand**: As your confidence grows, slowly broaden who you approach. You'll naturally become more attractive as you gain experience and comfort.

**Don't forget the first person who said yes**: If things go well early on, wonderful—but remember to treat that person with ongoing respect and gratitude. They took a chance on you.

# VI. What Success Looks Like

Success isn't measured by whether you find ""the one"" in your first month. Success looks like:

* Going on a date without crippling anxiety
* Having a genuine conversation with a stranger
* Handling rejection without falling apart
* Making someone else feel seen and valued
* Building a social life where connection is possible

The confidence and social skills you build through achievable connections will make you more attractive to everyone—including people you once thought were ""out of your league.""

**A personal note**: If we ever crossed paths, I'd happily grab coffee with you. Everyone deserves connection, kindness, and the chance to practice becoming their better self. Go create some opportunities.

1orfbib,https://youtu.be/aTvOotrGKPo,4 Very Scary TRUE Remote Overnight Road Trip Horror Stories,"# ""The Vanishing Point"":

Tom and I had been on the road for months, tracing a winding path through Australia in our faded orange van. We’d started in Sydney, picking up odd jobs along the way to keep our trip going. It was supposed to be the adventure of a lifetime — just us, open highways, and a country so vast it could swallow you whole.

That afternoon, we’d left a small town behind, heading north through the outback. The road stretched endlessly ahead, heat shimmering above the asphalt. Red dirt plains ran out to the horizon, broken only by the occasional scrub bush and the faint silhouettes of distant hills. No other cars. Just the hum of the tires and an old rock song playing softly from the radio.

We talked about stopping at some rock formations up ahead, maybe camping there for the night. The sun was low, melting into the horizon in bands of orange and violet. Then, in the rearview mirror, I noticed a white truck behind us — an older model with a green canvas cover over the back.

At first, it was distant. Then it got closer. Too close.

“Look at that guy,” I said. “He’s been following us since the last fuel stop.”

Tom glanced at the mirror. “Probably just heading north too. Not many roads out here.” He smiled, turned up the volume a little, and tapped the steering wheel.

But the truck stayed on us, headlights glaring in the mirror. Then it accelerated, pulling up alongside. The driver — a rough-looking man in a dusty cap — leaned out his window and gestured frantically, pointing toward the back of our van.

“Pull over!” he shouted over the wind. “Something’s wrong with your exhaust!”

Tom frowned. “Might be serious. Better check it out.”

A small knot of unease twisted in my stomach, but out here, people helped each other. That was the unspoken rule of the road. So Tom eased the van onto the shoulder. Dust rolled around us in the fading light as the truck pulled up ahead.

The man climbed out. He was tall, wiry, mid-forties maybe, sunburned skin and stubble. His eyes darted quickly over the van, then to me in the passenger seat.

Tom walked over. “You said you saw sparks?”

“Yeah,” the man replied casually, pointing toward the rear. “Back here, under the muffler. Looked bad.”

I watched through the mirror as Tom crouched to check. The man stood just behind him, hands in his pockets. Something about his stillness made the air feel heavier.

Then came the sound — sharp, violent, unmistakable. A gunshot.

Tom collapsed instantly.

For a moment, the world stopped. I couldn’t process it — couldn’t even breathe — until the man turned toward me, a silver pistol gleaming in his hand. He strode to my door, yanked it open, and pointed the barrel straight at my face.

“Out,” he ordered.

My mind emptied. I raised trembling hands. “Please — what did you do to him?”

“Out,” he repeated, grabbing my wrist and dragging me from the seat. The zip ties came next — thick, black, cutting into my skin as he tightened them behind my back.

“Don’t fight,” he said coldly. “Or it gets worse.”

He pushed me toward his truck, the gun pressing hard against my ribs. There was a brown dog sitting in the front seat, silent, watching. It didn’t bark — just stared as if it understood everything that was happening.

He opened the back of the truck. A dark tarp was spread out inside. I realized then what this was — not a robbery, not random. Something much worse.

I struggled, kicking back with both feet. “Let me go!” I screamed. “Help!”

He slapped tape across my mouth, but I shook it loose, biting and thrashing. “Quiet!” he hissed, glancing toward the empty road.

That second of distraction saved my life. I spun, slammed my shoulder into him, and ran.

I didn’t look back. My wrists were bound, but adrenaline gave me speed. I plunged into the bush beside the highway — thorny shrubs clawing at my legs, branches snapping underfoot. I dove under a dense tangle of spinifex and froze, chest heaving.

His boots crunched on the gravel behind me. The flashlight flicked on. “Come out!” he shouted, voice low and furious. “You can’t hide from me.”

The beam swept through the bushes — slow, methodical — passing inches from my face. My lungs screamed for air, but I didn’t dare move. He circled, the light coming closer each time. The dog whined somewhere near the truck.

Minutes bled into hours. The desert night grew cold, the silence broken only by insects and his distant muttering. Twice he returned, calling out threats, shining that light again.

Eventually, the sound of his engine roared to life. Headlights cut across the scrub, then faded into the darkness.

I didn’t move right away. I waited — until my muscles burned and my hands were numb — before crawling back toward the highway. The night sky stretched above, black and endless.

When the distant glow of headlights appeared, I stumbled out, waving my tied hands, tears streaming down my face.

The road train screeched to a stop, dust swirling around me. Two men jumped down — truckers, both wide-eyed and shocked.

“What the hell happened to you?” one of them asked.

“Someone— someone shot my boyfriend,” I gasped. “He tried to take me.”

They cut the ties, wrapped me in a blanket, and got me into the cab. One radioed ahead, his voice steady but tight. “Got a woman here — possible abduction, gunshot involved. North of Barrow Creek.”

At the pub in town, people gathered, whispering, watching me like I was a ghost. Police arrived soon after. I told them everything — the van, the man, the gun, Tom. They went back to search the highway.

They found blood. Drag marks. Nothing else.

The van was still there, door open, engine cooling in the desert night. But Tom was gone.

Months later, they caught him — Bradley John Murdoch. A mechanic. Drifter. DNA from the zip ties matched. He got life in prison.

But Tom’s body was never found.

Sometimes, when I dream, I see that endless road again — the white truck in the mirror, the orange light of sunset fading over the desert. I still wonder if somewhere out there, beyond the horizon, Tom is waiting in the silence of the outback, calling my name in the wind.





# ""The Blue Van"":

I was fifteen, standing on the shoulder of Interstate 5 with a cardboard sign that read **“South.”** The letters were smudged from sweat, the edges flapping in the hot wind. My arms were baked brown from the Vegas sun, my backpack nearly empty—just a change of clothes, a half-empty water bottle, and a few crumpled bills. Two other kids waited a few yards away, pretending not to look hopeful.

When the blue van slowed, dust curling around its tires, I thought my luck had finally turned. The driver leaned over, one hand on the wheel. “Room for one,” he said. His voice was steady, calm—almost grandfatherly. “You coming or not?”

I glanced at the other two. They shook their heads. I was tired of waiting. So I climbed in.

The cab smelled of oil, cigarettes, and old coffee. Tools clanked in the back with each bump. “Name’s Larry,” he said, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. “Where to?”

“Los Angeles,” I told him. “My grandpa’s place.”

He nodded, like that made perfect sense. We talked a little—nothing deep. He said he’d been a sailor once, that he liked the open road now. I told him about the fight with my mom, how I’d left before she could stop me. The miles slipped by easy, the desert flattening to gold and gray.

Then he missed the exit for I-5 South.

“You went past it,” I said.

“Oops,” he chuckled. “We’ll circle back.”

But we didn’t. He turned onto a narrow canyon road instead, where the asphalt cracked and the sagebrush grew high and dry. The sun dipped low, spilling orange light across the windshield. My stomach twisted, but I stayed quiet. When he finally pulled over, he stretched, saying, “Need to walk a bit.”

I got out too, pretending to retie my shoe. The air felt heavy and still. I was just starting to stand when the hammer hit—hard, behind my ear. The world spun sideways and went black.

When I came to, my wrists were tied, rope burning my skin. My head rang. Larry was dragging me toward the van’s rear doors. His face had changed—no warmth, no voice, just something hollow and fixed. “Don’t make a sound,” he said.

The night swallowed everything after that. The assaults came in waves—violence, silence, breathing, laughter. I begged. I promised. “I won’t tell. I just want to go home.” He only laughed once, soft and low, like I’d said something funny.

By dawn, the desert was pale and cold. He pulled a hatchet from his toolbox, blade dull with use. “Hold still.”

I tried to fight. The rope held. He grabbed my arm, laid it across a log, and swung. The pain was so bright it erased everything. My scream didn’t sound human. He did the other the same. Blood pulsed, spraying the sand.

He stuffed what was left of me into a plastic bag, tossed it aside like trash, and dragged me to the edge of a ravine. “Stay quiet down there,” he said, and shoved me into a concrete drainage pipe before driving away. The van’s engine faded, leaving nothing but wind.

I lay there for hours, half-buried in mud and blood. The cold came fast. I pressed handfuls of wet dirt against the stumps, packing it thick to slow the bleeding. Shock dulled the pain, but something deep inside refused to quit.

Every inch up that ravine was agony. Rocks tore at my knees, my face, my ribs. I crawled until my vision blurred white and the world began to tilt. Then—pavement. Headlights. A red car skidded to a stop.

“Oh my God,” a woman screamed. Hands wrapped me in a blanket. The car doors slammed, tires screeched, sirens blurred. In the hospital I watched the ceiling lights pass overhead in a steady rhythm—white, white, white—until they stopped moving.

When I woke again, I told them everything. The van. The hammer. The smell of oil. His glasses. His voice. I spoke through the pain because I needed someone to know.

Weeks later, in court, I pointed across the room with my new steel hook. “That’s him.” Larry didn’t even look at me. The judge gave him fourteen years. He served eight.

By then, I’d learned to hold a paintbrush between my prosthetics. I visited schools, talked about trust, about running away, about what monsters actually look like.

In 1997, he killed again—a woman in Florida. When they called, I flew down and testified once more. This time, they gave him death row. Cancer beat the needle to him.

Sometimes, when I’m alone, I still feel the hatchet’s weight—the air before it falls, the sound the canyon made after. But I walk upright now, hooks clicking against my pockets. Proof that the road didn’t win.





# ""Nowhere Left to Run"":

I had just turned eighteen, finishing my last year of high school, when Mr. Harris—my science teacher—started offering to help me after class. He was in his late forties, kind at first, the sort of teacher everyone said cared too much. Married, with two kids of his own, but there was something in the way he looked at me—like we shared some quiet secret.

At the time, I didn’t think much of it. My home life was falling apart—my parents fought almost every night, and I spent most evenings hiding in my room with music playing to drown them out. So when Mr. Harris listened, really listened, it felt like someone finally saw me. He’d say things like, *“You’re different, you know that? You deserve better than this town, better than what they’ve given you.”* I believed him. I didn’t recognize how carefully he was building that trust.

Then, in February, another teacher saw us talking too close in the hallway—his hand brushing mine as he handed back a test. Rumors spread fast. I got called into the counselor’s office, asked questions I didn’t know how to answer. Mr. Harris was suspended for a week. Everyone thought that was the end of it.

It wasn’t.

He started texting me from an unknown number—messages that sounded desperate, pleading. *“I can’t lose you. You’re the only one who understands me.”* I tried to ignore them, but he wouldn’t stop. Once, he mentioned my little sister by name, said she looked just like me. That was when the fear set in—real, icy fear.

One afternoon in March, he was waiting by the curb after school. He told me to get in—said we just needed to talk. I hesitated, but he smiled the way teachers do when they’re trying to calm you down. Once I was in the car, though, everything changed. He didn’t turn toward town—he merged onto the highway.

“Where are we going?” I asked.

“Just a little trip,” he said softly, eyes fixed on the road. “You’ll see. This is for us.”

My phone buzzed in my lap—friends asking where I was—but he grabbed it and hurled it out the window before I could answer. “No distractions,” he said. His voice was calm, too calm.

We drove for hours. The scenery shifted from suburban roads to endless fields, then to small towns with peeling signs and dusty gas stations. He talked about starting over somewhere new, about how we could live freely without anyone judging us. I told him I wanted to go home, but he only gripped the wheel tighter, knuckles white.

That night, we stopped at a rundown motel off the interstate. He locked the door behind us and sat on the bed, staring at me like he was waiting for something. “Tell me you trust me,” he said.

I nodded, because I was too afraid to do anything else.

The days after that blurred together—long stretches of highway, rest stops, cheap motels, and silence. We crossed into Oklahoma, then Colorado. He dyed his hair darker in a gas station bathroom and made me wear a hat to hide my face. “If anyone asks, you’re my niece,” he told me.

Once, at a rest area, I saw a clerk behind the counter and thought about running—but I felt his hand clamp down on my shoulder before I even took a step. His grip was firm, his voice steady. “Don’t even think about it,” he whispered.

By the time we reached northern California, his tone had shifted. The kindness was gone. He spoke in circles about his marriage, how his wife never appreciated him, how I was *meant* to be with him. “I’ve waited for someone like you,” he murmured one night as the car wound through empty mountain roads. I pretended to sleep while my mind raced for a way out.

Eventually, we ended up in a cabin tucked deep in the woods—miles from any real road, surrounded by silence. He said it was temporary, just until we figured out a plan to cross into Mexico. There was no cell signal, no neighbors, no one who could hear me scream.

He became paranoid, possessive. He wouldn’t let me go outside alone. At dinner, he’d sit across from me and watch every movement I made. “You belong with me now,” he said once, his tone almost tender. When I cried, his face hardened. “Don’t make me do something we’ll both regret.”

There was a gun in his bag. I saw it once when he pulled out his wallet. After that, I stopped arguing.

A few days later, a local man at a nearby supply store noticed something off. Maybe it was the way I wouldn’t look up, or how Mr. Harris kept answering questions meant for me. That man called the police.

They came at dawn. The sound of boots crunching on gravel outside the cabin was the most beautiful thing I’d ever heard. Mr. Harris tried to say I came willingly, tried to twist everything into something innocent. But this time, I spoke.

He was arrested that morning.

When they drove me back home, everything felt unreal—like I’d woken up in a version of my life that didn’t quite fit anymore. It took a long time to feel safe again. Even now, when I pass by a school or see a car that looks like his, something in me freezes.

I used to think monsters looked obvious—creatures hiding in shadows. But sometimes, they wear friendly smiles, carry lesson plans, and tell you you’re special until you start to believe it.

Those weeks on the road taught me that safety isn’t something you have—it’s something that can vanish in an instant.





# ""The Tow"":

I had just clocked out from another long shift at the warehouse when Tom called, his voice buzzing with excitement. “Dude, let’s just hit the road tonight,” he said. “The festival’s this weekend, right? No point waiting till morning.”

We’d been planning the trip for weeks — Colorado mountains, live music, camping, and a break from everything that had started to feel routine. My old sedan was already packed with snacks, a cooler, and our gear. Driving from Ohio to Colorado would take close to twenty hours, but the plan was simple: trade off behind the wheel, take the back routes, and drive through the night to beat the crowds.

Tom had always been the adventurous one — the kind of guy who trusted map apps that promised “scenic detours” and “less traffic.” I just liked the idea of open roads and freedom.

We rolled out around 7 p.m., the sky melting from orange to dark violet. Tom took the first shift, blasting his favorite playlist as the farmland slid past under the last traces of daylight. I drifted in and out of sleep, the hum of the engine and soft vibration of the tires lulling me under.

A couple hours later, Tom nudged me. “Hey, man, check this out.” He pointed to his phone’s map. “This road up ahead — cuts right through a national forest. Says it’ll save us almost an hour.”

I blinked at the screen, half awake. The road looked like a skinny gray thread through a huge patch of green. No towns. No gas stations. Just wilderness.

“You sure?” I mumbled.

He grinned. “Come on, Jack. It’ll be fine. Empty, quiet, more stars.”

We turned off the interstate, the pavement narrowing as tall pines closed in on both sides. At first, it was peaceful — almost beautiful. The headlights cut tunnels through mist, and every so often, we’d catch a pair of deer eyes glinting from the brush.

Then, out of nowhere, the engine began to sputter.

Tom frowned, tapping the gas. “You feel that?”

The dashboard lights flickered. A coughing sound came from under the hood, then silence. He eased us onto the shoulder of the empty road.

We got out, the night air cold and still. When I popped the hood, the beam from my flashlight caught a thin wisp of steam curling upward. Neither of us had a clue what we were looking at.

“Probably bad gas from that last station,” I said, though I didn’t sound convinced.

We tried restarting it a few times — nothing. Then I checked my phone. No bars. Tom’s was dead too.

“Perfect,” he muttered, kicking the gravel. “Middle of nowhere.”

We were debating whether to walk back toward the interstate or forward into God-knows-where when headlights appeared behind us — faint at first, then blindingly bright. A pickup truck slowed and pulled over.

A man stepped out. He looked to be in his late 50s, wearing a faded denim jacket and heavy work boots. His face was hard to read in the glare, but his posture was easy, almost friendly.

“You boys havin’ car trouble?” he called, his voice gravelly but calm.

Tom exhaled with relief. “Yeah, man, it just died on us. Won’t start.”

The stranger nodded, walking closer. “Could be your alternator. Dust kills those things out here.” He motioned toward his truck. “Got some tools in the back. Name’s Earl. Live up the road a ways.”

Tom introduced us, ever the optimist. “Appreciate it, Earl.”

Earl poked around under the hood, humming quietly. After a minute, he straightened up. “Looks like a loose belt. I could tighten it, but it’ll take some time. Or…” — he smiled — “I could tow you to my place, fix it proper. I got a full setup in the barn.”

Tom looked at me. “Better than freezing out here.”

Something in me hesitated. The road was too quiet, too dark. Earl’s eyes flicked over our car, to the cooler, the bags. His smile didn’t reach his eyes.

“Maybe we should wait till morning,” I said.

Earl shook his head. “No service here. Towing company won’t come till daylight, and they’ll rob you blind. Come on, I got coffee on. My wife made stew earlier.”

Tom shrugged. “Sounds good to me.”

Reluctantly, I agreed. We hooked a chain from his truck to our bumper and followed as he towed us deeper into the forest.

The drive felt longer than it should’ve — twenty minutes, maybe more. No signs of life. When we finally saw a light ahead, it was a small house off a dirt path, with a barn behind it glowing under a single bulb.

No other lights. No sign of a wife.

“She’s probably asleep,” Earl said casually as we pulled up. “Come on in while I grab my tools.”

Inside, the place smelled musty — like old wood, rust, and something faintly metallic. The living room had a sagging couch, yellowed curtains, and a table littered with old newspapers.

Earl poured us coffee from a pot on the stove. “Make yourselves at home. I’ll be out in the barn.”

He grabbed a toolbox and disappeared through the door.

Tom grinned. “See? Nice guy. Told you we’d be fine.”

I tried to smile, but something was wrong. The coffee was bitter, almost sour, and the house felt… too still. There were locked doors down the hallway, heavy bolts on the inside. And from upstairs, a faint scratching sound — slow and rhythmic, like nails on wood.

“You hear that?” I whispered.

Tom frowned. “Probably mice, man. Chill.”

But then the lights flickered. I glanced through the window toward the barn. Earl wasn’t fixing the car. He was rummaging through our trunk — pulling out our duffel bags, opening them, setting things aside.

“Tom.” I pointed. His smile vanished. “What the hell is he doing?”

We bolted for the door. It didn’t move. Locked — from the outside.

“Earl!” Tom shouted, pounding on it. No answer.

I tried the back door — same thing.

The scratching upstairs grew louder. It wasn’t a mouse. It was deliberate.

Tom grabbed a chair, ready to smash a window, when we heard Earl’s voice outside — calm, but wrong. “You boys shouldn’t snoop around. Folks get hurt that way.”

His footsteps crunched on gravel as he circled the house. Slow. Measured.

“Call for help,” Tom hissed. But our phones still had no signal.

I glanced at the newspapers scattered on the table. The top one caught my eye — *LOCAL DRIVERS STILL MISSING*. Beneath it, another: *ABANDONED VEHICLE FOUND IN NATIONAL FOREST*. The photo looked disturbingly familiar — same make, same color as my car.

“Tom…” My voice cracked. “He’s done this before.”

The doorknob rattled. “Come on now,” Earl said softly. “Let’s talk this through.”

We backed away, every nerve screaming. Tom pointed to the kitchen. “Window.”

It was small, but big enough. We squeezed through one by one, landing in the damp grass outside.

The barn door hung open. Our car was still hooked up.

“Go!” I hissed.

We unlatched the chain, dove into the car. The engine roared to life — perfectly.

“Guess it wasn’t broken after all,” Tom muttered, panic rising.

Headlights flared behind us. Earl’s truck.

He gunned the engine, closing fast. The road exploded with dust as he slammed his horn, ramming our bumper.

“Go, go, go!” I yelled.

Tom floored it. The sedan fishtailed onto the main road, tires screeching. Earl’s high beams filled the mirror, blinding us.

He rammed us again, harder.

“What does he *want*?” Tom shouted.

I didn’t know. Money? Something worse? Maybe he didn’t want anything. Maybe he just liked the chase.

The road curved sharply, trees blurring by. Earl’s truck swung up alongside, his face lit by the dashboard glow — mouth twisted into a grin that didn’t look human.

Tom slammed the brakes, and Earl shot past. We veered right, onto a side trail barely wide enough for a car. Branches clawed at the windows. The truck followed, grinding through mud.

“Come on, come on,” I whispered.

After what felt like hours, the trail widened and connected to a paved road. A small building appeared ahead — a ranger station. Light spilled from the windows.

Tom blasted the horn, skidding into the lot.

A ranger came out, flashlight raised. “What’s going on?”

“That guy—he’s chasing us!” I shouted, pointing behind.

Earl’s truck appeared at the far edge of the road, idling for a moment… then turned, taillights fading into the trees.

The ranger called it in. Police searched the area for hours but never found him. Turns out, there’d been reports before — a man fitting Earl’s description, preying on stranded travelers along forest backroads. No permanent address. No wife. No real name anyone could confirm.

Our bags were gone from the trunk, but we were alive.

We drove home at sunrise, sticking to the main highways this time.

Tom still talks about going to another festival someday, but I can’t. Not after that night. Even now, when I drive past a dark stretch of road, I can’t help glancing in the rearview — half expecting to see those high beams again, closing in.",1,1762573625.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

In particular, our World Model is composed of a State model (which focuses on the situation), an Agent model (which focuses on other people) and an Action model (which predicts what might happen next)

\-------

**Key passages:**

>A new study provides evidence that the human brain constructs our seamless experience of the world by first breaking it down into separate predictive models. These distinct models, which forecast different aspects of reality like context, people’s intentions, and potential actions, are then unified in a central hub to create our coherent, ongoing subjective experience

and

>The scientists behind the new study proposed that our world model is fragmented into at least three core domains. The first is a “State” model, which represents the abstract context or situation we are in. The second is an “Agent” model, which handles our understanding of other people, their beliefs, their goals, and their perspectives. The third is an “Action” model, which predicts the flow of events and possible paths through a situation.

and

>The problem with this is non-trivial. If it does have multiple modules, how can we have our experience seemingly unified? \[...\] In learning theories, there are distinct computations needed to form what is called a world model. We need to infer from sensory observations what state we are in (context). For e.g. if you go to a coffee shop, the state is that you’re about to get a coffee. Similarly, you need to have a frame of reference to put these states in. For instance, you want to go to the next shop but your friend had a bad experience there previously, you need to take their perspective (or frame) into account. You possibly had a plan of getting a coffee and chat, but now you’re willing to adapt a new plan (action transitions) of getting a matcha drink instead. You’re able to do all these things because various modules can coordinate their output, or predictions together",1,1762573239.0,newAIParadigms,1,1.0,False
1orf6se,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestkitchentool/comments/1orf6se/beyond_reheating_transform_your_microwave_into_a/,Beyond Reheating: Transform Your Microwave Into a Culinary Powerhouse,"Think your microwave is just for reheating coffee and making popcorn? Think again. This humble kitchen workhorse is one of the most underutilized appliances in modern cooking, capable of producing restaurant-quality meals with just a fraction of the energy and time.

## The Microwave Revolution: More Than Just a Box

When most people hear ""microwave,"" they instantly think of quick fixes and convenience foods. But the truth is, microwave technology has evolved dramatically. Today's units offer precise power control, sensor cooking, and convection capabilities that can revolutionize your meal prep routine.

*The difference between mediocre microwave results and spectacular ones often comes down to understanding the science—and having the right accessories in your arsenal.*

## Mastering Microwave Fundamentals

### Understanding Power Levels

Your microwave isn't just an on/off switch. Different power levels serve distinct purposes:

- **100% power**: Perfect for boiling water, cooking vegetables, or reheating soups
- **70% power**: Ideal for cooking denser foods like casseroles
- **50% power**: Best for gentle reheating and defrosting
- **30% power**: Excellent for softening butter or melting chocolate without scorching

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=microwave)

### The Art of Arrangement

How you position food dramatically affects cooking quality:

- Arrange food in a circular pattern with thicker portions toward the outside edge
- Leave space between items for even energy distribution
- Turn dishes 90 degrees midway through cooking for uniform results

## Game-Changing Microwave Tools I Wish I'd Found Sooner

After years of trial and error, these accessories transformed my microwave cooking:

> **Microwave Silicon Steamer**: This brilliant invention lets you steam vegetables to perfection in minutes, preserving nutrients and texture. The collapsible design makes storage a breeze, and the results rival traditional stovetop steaming.

> **Microwave Browning Dish**: When you miss that oven-baked finish, a specialty browning dish creates the perfect crispy exterior on items like chicken, fish, and baked potatoes—something regular microwaving can't achieve.

> **Glass Stackable Cookware**: Investing in quality tempered glass containers with vented lids changed everything. They heat evenly, don't retain odors, and go directly from microwave to table.

## Advanced Microwave Techniques

### The ""Pre-Heat"" Method

For better results with dense foods, try running your microwave empty for 1 minute before cooking. This preheating creates more consistent cooking conditions.

### The Standing Rule

Always let food stand for 2-5 minutes after microwaving. This crucial step allows heat to distribute evenly and finish the cooking process—called ""carryover cooking"" in professional kitchens.

### Moisture Management

- Cover foods with a paper towel to absorb excess moisture
- Use microwave-safe plastic wrap with a vent hole to trap steam
- Add a tablespoon of water when reheating breads or pastries to prevent drying

## Microwave Maintenance for Peak Performance

Your microwave works best when properly maintained:

- Clean spills immediately to prevent baked-on messes
- Place a bowl of water with lemon slices inside and run for 3 minutes to loosen stubborn stains
- Check the door seal regularly for damage
- Never operate when empty—this can damage the magnetron

## Breaking Common Microwave Myths

**Myth**: Microwaves destroy nutrients in food
**Reality**: All cooking methods reduce some nutrients. Microwave cooking often preserves more nutrients than boiling because of shorter cooking times and less water usage.

**Myth**: Microwaved food is dangerous to consume
**Reality**: Microwave radiation is non-ionizing and doesn't make food radioactive. The only concern is uneven heating, which is why stirring and standing times are important.

## Troubleshooting Common Microwave Problems

### Uneven Heating Solutions:
- Use a turntable or rotate food manually
- Cut food into uniform sizes
- Arrange in a circle, not a square

### Soggy Results Prevention:
- Use paper towels to absorb moisture
- Create space for steam to escape
- Finish with brief conventional heating if available

### Explosive Situations Avoided:
- Pierce foods with skins (potatoes, squash)
- Pierce egg yolks before cooking
- Never heat sealed containers

## The Future of Microwave Cooking

The next generation of smart microwaves already offers:
- Built-in recipe databases
- Automatic food recognition
- Voice control integration
- Precision temperature probes
- Multi-stage programming

These advances make microwave cooking more accessible and reliable than ever before.

## Final Thoughts

Your microwave deserves respect as a legitimate cooking tool, not just a convenience appliance. With the right techniques and accessories, it can produce healthy, delicious meals with minimal energy consumption and maximum convenience.

The next time you reach for your microwave, remember: you're not just reheating—you're harnessing one of the kitchen's most versatile technologies. Experiment with new techniques, invest in quality accessories, and prepare to be amazed by what this humble appliance can really do.

So I've become a bit of an enthusiast myself in the last few years and in particular when I spent some time working as a barista. I was working off the Linea Classic S EE 2 Group (I believe). 

Anyways, I miss pulling my own shots and making my own cappuccinos. Not to mention I'm spending a lot of money on bad coffee these days. 

With that said, I spent the last hour doing quite a bit of research and I narrowed it down to these grinders and these machines. I know some of these options are quite different, but I'm hoping someone will make a compelling case. Budget isn't necessarily an issue. I mean let's say I'd rather not spend more than 6-7k on an entire set up, but for me it's more important to get a good deal. If I get something at the right price and can resell it later, then that's ok with me. I'm also happy spending less, as even with some barista experience I know I won't understand all the bells and whistles on some machines and grinders. Really I just want to have some freaking good coffee but I don't want to have too hard of a time cleaning a machine, and I don't want to spend money on something that will devalue if there isn't a massive quality difference. With that in mind

machines:

I’m a College student so I’m busy at least a few hours each day. I’m a Short king (5’4”), with long hair and a goatee. I’m Nerdy, I like Star Wars, MTG, a few anime, Legos, and comic book characters.

I will warn I’m a little clingy (I get attached to someone and will make them the center of my attention). I also have an anxious attachment style (basically I’m terrified I’m not good enough and thus overthink little things) so honestly and communication are priorities of mine in a relationship.

What I’m looking for:
Long term relationship, even if long distance/online. Preferably someone around my age: 19-26.
I want someone who can be loving, gentle and kind as well as someone willing to talk to me for hours on end. My “Type” varies based on gender: I like tough women (tomboys, witches and goths) and softer/feminine men, but I’ve been known to go outside of my types for a strong emotional connection.

Perhaps the most obvious answer is to be from the inner party: it is the equivalent of the upper class of our world, they have tea or coffee and cigarettes that do not fall apart just by turning them upside down. But the price of this is being one with the party. Individuality does not exist, consciousness and mind merge into the whole of the community through pure doublethink, he who is a member of the inner party will be happy but that happiness will not be his and all his well-being will depend on the well-being of the Party not only for economic prosperity and etc., but because his being would be one with the party itself.


On the other hand, the ploretarians. They are the poorest in theory, yes, but at the same time I think they are the happiest, because not only are they relatively free alongside the members of the external and internal party but they are also completely exempt from responsibility. They live in a separate society from Winston and Julia. They have their businesses, their relationships, their hobbies and they are free to do them as long as they do not harm the party, but at the same time everything bad that happens to them is usually the direct fault of the party and this is nothing but a cause of happiness.
As Sartre, a French philosopher of the 20th century, said, the human being is condemned to be free, because in his freedom he is responsible for all his miseries since it is his own decisions in freedom that led him to said misery and this freedom is what makes him not only miserable but also responsible for his own suffering. But this does not happen with the proletariats. That's the point of ""freedom is slavery."" 

Therefore, except for the Outer Party where all its members are completely unfortunate and condemned, one could say that the society of Oceania is not at all bad and that brings up my doubt: would they prefer to be one with the party and sacrifice their individuality for power (that is, be from the inner party) or would they prefer to sacrifice all their dignity, freedom, voice and importance in exchange for relative happiness (being proletarian)",2,1762571760.0,1984,4,0.75,False

I matched with a guy on Facebook dating, but in the ""friend"" section. We bonded over both being autistic. I didn't know what to expect really the first time we met for coffee. But he said he was straight (he has an ex-wife and two kids) and just looking for another friend to hang out with. I'm looking for the same thing. So it's been a year and a half of having a cool friend. 

There were obvious signs of him being bi-curious early on. Like, we we're going on a trip to Eastern Europe last December And he asked if I would be interested in going to a swinger's party/orgy with him. I declined and he didn't end up going. There's a whole list of things I could give that would make the post too long. It's already too long. Through it all though he has maintained that he is ""straight"". But here's my problem:

After a year and a half of being good friends I think his curiosity is getting to him. I've recently lost weight and he's made more comments. We went to an EDM concert 2 weeks ago and he kept complimenting me and twice reached out and touched my stomach. He was on that magic at the time so I didn't think too much of it. He crashed at my place because he wasn't sober enough to drive home. He was asking about my dating life and insisting that I should find an autistic man who will understand me more. I slept on the couch, he crashed in my bed and was in there until 1:00 p.m.

But since then he has sent me pictures of his kids (that he has full custody of) doing cute things. He knows I would love to be a father someday. As of writing this post, he wants to go out to another event and do some pre-partying at my house then carpool together. Which means him staying at my house again because I for the most part stay sober. I had to tell him I wasn't feeling up to going.

I thought I might be sexually interested in him early on but he's done some things that turned me off. Plus I was enjoying just having a good friend. But this might also be my bad. Like, we had semi-romantic strolls through Vienna and Budapest and along the River Danube. And another time I went to a state fair with him and his kids and one of them joked about me being his dad's girlfriend. The boy whispered to his dad to ask if he liked me. I babysat them one time so he could go out and the kids enjoyed my company. It's in match made in heaven but it's also not.

How do I politely turn him down while saving the friendship?",0,1762571574.0,askgaybros,3,0.5,False

Too many high achievers obsess over the wrong financial details: tracking every coffee, juggling ten checking accounts, or chasing credit card points, while ignoring the big levers that actually move the needle.

In this episode, Priya Malani breaks down why ambitious 30-somethings get stuck in the weeds and how to shift your focus to the questions that truly change your financial trajectory. You’ll hear a real client story, insights from Ramit Sethi’s “$3 vs. $30,000 questions,” and Natalie Taylor’s framework for “impact-weighted work.” By the end, you’ll have a clear path to simplify your money, reduce stress, and start making progress that actually matters.



Tune Into This Episode to Hear:

* Why activity ≠ progress when it comes to your money
* The difference between $3 questions (skip Starbucks?) and $30,000 questions (negotiate your comp?)
* How “impact-weighted work” can help you stop overanalyzing and start moving forward
* A simple framework to consolidate accounts, automate, and focus on big levers like income, savings, investing, and protection

It's easy to get lost in a cycle of superficial interactions and emotional burnout.

What if there was a simple, structured framework to help you navigate the chaos? A way to pace yourself, genuinely get to know someone, and build a connection that lasts?

Enter the **7-7-7 rule**.

It’s not some magical love spell, but a practical guideline for pacing a new relationship. It helps you filter for compatibility, manage your emotional investment, and build a stronger foundation from the very beginning.

## So, What Exactly *is* the 7-7-7 Rule?

At its core, the 7-7-7 rule breaks down the early stages of a relationship into three distinct, manageable phases. Each ""seven"" represents a period of time where you focus on a specific level of connection and discovery.

Let's break it down:

### **1. The First 7 Days: The Vibe Check**

This initial week is all about low-pressure discovery. You've just matched with someone or gotten their number, and now it's time to see if there's even a spark worth pursuing.

*   **Goal:** To establish a basic rapport and determine if you want to meet in person.
*   **What it looks like:** Light, fun conversation. Ask about their day, their hobbies, their taste in music. Share a bit about yourself, too.
*   **What to avoid:** Don't treat this like a job interview or an intense therapy session. Avoid heavy topics like past traumas, deep-seated insecurities, or your five-year plan. Also, don't become a perpetual texter. The goal of these 7 days is to **schedule the first date.** If you're two weeks in and still just texting, the connection is likely to fizzle out.

### **2. The First 7 Weeks: The Exploration Phase**

You've had a first date (or a few!), and there seems to be a genuine connection. Now begins the fun part: exploring compatibility beyond surface-level chat.

*   **Goal:** To see if your lifestyles, values, and personalities truly mesh in the real world.
*   **What it looks like:** This is the ""getting to know you"" period in action. Go on a variety of dates—not just dinner and drinks. Try a hiking date, a museum visit, a cooking class. See how they interact with the world. Pay attention to the little things: How do they treat a server? How do they handle a minor plan change? Do you laugh together? Can you hold a conversation in person?
*   **What to avoid:** Don't rush into exclusivity or intense emotional intimacy. This is still the screening phase. It’s easy to get caught up in ""new relationship energy"" (NRE), but the 7-7-7 rule encourages you to keep your head and observe with your heart *and* your mind.

### **3. The First 7 Months: The Foundation Building**

You've made it past the initial whirlwind, and you consistently enjoy each other's company. You're likely seeing each other regularly, and the question of ""what are we?"" is starting to feel relevant.

*   **Goal:** To build a deeper emotional bond and decide if this is a partnership for the long haul.
*   **What it looks like:** This is when you start integrating them into your life in a more meaningful way. Introduce them to your friends. Maybe they meet a family member. You navigate your first real disagreement and see how you both handle conflict. You have those deeper conversations about future goals, values, and what you both want from a relationship. This is often the time for ""the talk"" about exclusivity and commitment.
*   **What to avoid:** Don't ignore red flags in the name of ""making it work."" If a major incompatibility arises during this phase (e.g., you want kids and they absolutely don't), it's crucial to address it honestly rather than hoping it will just disappear.

## Why Does the 7-7-7 Rule Actually Work?

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=What%20is%20the%207%207%207%20rule%20in%20dating%3F)

This rule isn't just about arbitrary timelines. It’s rooted in principles of healthy relationship development.

*   **It Fights Against Love Bombing and Rushing:** By creating natural pauses, it protects you from people who move too fast, which can sometimes be a sign of manipulation or instability.
*   **It's a Built-in Compatibility Filter:** Each stage acts as a filter. If you don't make it past the 7-day mark, you’ve saved yourself weeks of emotional energy. If things fizzle at 7 weeks, you’ve likely discovered a fundamental lifestyle mismatch.
*   **It Prevents Burnout:** Modern dating is exhausting. This framework helps you manage your emotional energy, preventing you from going all-in on every single potential match.
*   **It Builds a Solid Foundation:** A relationship built slowly and intentionally is far more likely to withstand challenges than one built on an instant, infatuated rush.

## How to Apply the 7-7-7 Rule in Real Life

Ready to try it? Here’s a quick cheat sheet:

**During the First 7 Days:**
*   **Keep it light.** Think ""spark"" and ""fun.""
*   **The goal:** A first date. If they won't commit to a simple coffee, move on.

**During the First 7 Weeks:**
*   **Go on real dates.** See how they are in different environments.
*   **Observe, don't just absorb.** Pay attention to their actions, not just their words.
*   **Keep your options open.** You're still single and getting to know people.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=What%20is%20the%207%207%207%20rule%20in%20dating%3F)

**During the First 7 Months:**
*   **Have the important talks.** Exclusivity, values, future goals.
*   **Meet the friends.** See how they fit into your social circle.
*   **Navigate conflict together.** This is a huge test of compatibility.

### **Important Caveat: This is a Guideline, Not a Gospel**

No dating rule is perfect. The 7-7-7 rule is a *tool*, not a law. Sometimes, a powerful connection can defy timelines. The most important rule of all is to trust your intuition.

If something feels off at day 5, don't ignore it. If you're both clearly on the same page and ready to be exclusive at week 5, that’s okay too! The rule is meant to empower you, not trap you. It gives you a default structure to fall back on when the chaos of dating feels overwhelming.

---

Ultimately, the 7-7-7 rule is about being intentional with your time and your heart. It encourages you to slow down, pay attention, and build connections that have the potential to become something real and lasting.

*It’s commonly accepted that one of the things that makes a great delver is the ability to adapt to any adversity, and to operate under considerable pressure. This pressure doesn’t just apply to activities within a dungeon, either. Sometimes, the greatest struggles a delver can face come from the world outside the dungeons that make them strong.*

​    “Sorry, but you’re just not the type of person we’re looking for in our guild.”

​    Grim instantly thought of Veyra as he heard those damning words, and clenched his teeth. It was better than his first impulse, which was to break something. That drunk… She’d been right. He hadn’t wanted to believe it, but she’d been right.

​    “Why?” He asked, trying to keep his voice as level as possible, as if he didn’t know why. “I told you, I received the top marks in my year, and I already have a great track record for first delves. Not just among my class, but in the history of the guild, I’m easily ranked in the top five.”

​    The Compass Rose clerk sifted through a small pile of papers, making it clear that her interest in this conversation was already at a supreme low. “I’m just passing on what I heard from my Captain. You applied, and they declined. What more do you want to know?”

​    “I already said,” Grim shot back. He could feel the heat starting to creep into his face and made a fierce attempt to control his expression. “Why?”

​    The clerk let out a long sigh, the noise a perfect balance between exasperation and boredom, and fished a slip of paper out of the stack on her desk. “Grim Kestrel… Yes, it says here that you were disrespectful in the extreme to your last Guildmaster and that you attempted to sabotage the rightfully earned reward of your fellow classmate. It also says here that you were not the top scorer, so it also seems that you are fond of lying, as well.”

​    Which might have all been reasonable and respectable reasons in another situation. But they were outrageous lies, and the delivery came with such a self-satisfied expression on the clerk’s face that it settled into stone for Grim. This woman was a noble, too, he realized. He clenched his fists, no longer sure that his jaw should bear the burden alone, and choked out a reply, “That isn’t true. I know I took the top score. The emissary himself told me.”

​    “Ah, you speak the tongue of dungeon beasts, do you?” the clerk asked, her eyes widening. The sense of surprise–and maybe even respect–shocked Grim out of his anger for a moment, and he unclenched his fists. “You can speak Undercommon, and all those?”

​    “I-I can,” Grim said. Was this, of all his talents, really something that they’d praise? What about the hours he’d dedicated to learning tactics and growing stronger? “I… I don’t know them all yet, but I’m fully fluent in Undercommon, and I can even understand Tennido, Buristan, and Fellstongue.”

​    The clerk nodded slowly as she absorbed that statement, looking impressed in spite of herself. Grim began to relax slightly then, thinking that maybe this was some kind of test. Perhaps it was good he’d fought so hard to control his reaction, he thought. Then the clerk ruined that, as well as any chance he had of getting his remaining temper in control, with her next comment.

​    “Well, that figures. Commoners are close to the beasts, after all. I expect as an orphan, and a \*silver rat\*, you’d be even more adept at speaking those foul tongues.”

​    Grim felt something in the back of his head snap. “What the fuck did you just call me?”

​    The clerk offered him nothing more than the typical noble smirk and returned her attention to the notes laid out on the desk before her. Grim’s hand twitched to where his dagger sat in his belt, but he held him back with the very last bit of his self-control. It had been actual years since he’d heard that particular slur directed at him… He forced himself to take a step back, both physically and emotionally, to stop himself from attacking the woman. Not only would that get him thrown in a cell, but she was clearly much stronger than he was. At least level ten, which meant she had access to magic that could turn him into a scorch mark to be scrubbed from the floor.

​    “There has to be some kind of appeal process,” He said. He knew he couldn’t keep the anger out of his voice now, but he didn’t care. This clerk wasn’t the final deciding factor in the admission process. “Or some way that I can prove my worth.”

​    “You could always try to work your way up from one of the feeder guilds,” the clerk said, her tone indicating she thought this was impossible. “But unless you perform some legendary feat that wins you a noble title, I’m afraid even you know it’s hopeless. You’ll just have to accept your place, I’m afraid.”

​    Not even trying to disguise it now, he thought. He grabbed his right wrist with the other, physically holding himself back from a rash reaction that would only ruin his life further. The casual disregard was nothing new for him, being born so poor in a city where social status and connections were everything. But he’d always viewed delvers as different… Even the nobles spoke highly of delvers born of common stock, openly praising them for their deeds. Delving was supposed to be his path to fix all of that. If he could get into a good guild, then make a name for himself, he’d be able to bridge that insurmountable gap between himself and everyone around him. But now, even that dim dream had been shattered.

​    “Fine,” he said. The word was surprisingly easy to speak through clenched teeth. He turned sharply on his heel then, striding toward the guild’s entrance. Fine. If they didn’t want to give him the opportunity to even prove himself, he’d do it himself. He’d get to the starting line on his own merit. Then, when he was strong and they came crawling out of the sewers with offers of friendship and camaraderie, he’d remind them.

​    “Just you wait,” he said, turning to glare at the entrance to the Compass Rose. The guild he’d admired for so many years, for pushing the boundary of what delvers could do. “Just you wait. Someday, they’re going to ask you why you failed… They’ll ask you where it all went wrong. And when they do, you can tell them all about today. Tell them about me.”

​    Veyra cradled her head gently between both hands, wincing at the noise of the early morning patrons. The breakfast activities of The *Barrel's Bottom* weren’t the most comforting for a sorrowful hangover, nor for those afflicted with the ailment. While it wasn’t as loud as the usual evening affair–delvers drinking the night through were known to be rowdy–it still had sufficient volume to complement the tiny, invisible hammers ringing on the inside of her skull.

​    “You deserve this,” Bolton told her, settling down on the bench across from her, a steaming mug of coffee in either hand. “You can’t expect to drink your weight in crappy ale and not feel it in the morning.”

​    She couldn’t manage any more than an angry grumble in his direction. Trying to lie sideways on the bench beneath her offered some temporary relief, not to mention a cool surface on which to rest her head, but it didn’t last long, and carried with it the urge to empty her stomach onto the floor. Dennis would yell at her for that, and the noise would only further increase her discomfort. A pained sort of groan escaped her at the thought.

​    Bolton chuckled at her misery. These mornings, when Veyra felt the full consequences of her previous actions, were a sort of medicine for him. They made up for the antics he had to endure during their ‘recruiting’ trips to Beastwick and the insufferable snobs that lived here in the capital. If he had to suffer through this stuffy city, he should at least get some amusement out of it, and Veyra provided that in spades. It was the main reason he still agreed to come.

​    “Drink the coffee,” he told her sternly, hiding his smile behind his own mug. “You’ll feel better in time.”

​    “I hate coffee,” she whined, barely lifting her head enough to give the mug a dirty look. “It tastes like dirt. Order me something with some fruit in it.”

​    “That’ll just cause the same problem as last night,” Bolton said with a laugh, deliberately misunderstanding her request. “Drinking fruity things isn’t good for you, it seems.”

​    “You know that’s not what I meant!” She said, finally managing some heat. She sat bolt upright, then her face went a few shades pale, and she swayed on the spot. Bolton watched her critically, ready to bolt to the side if she hurled. But after a few seconds of struggle, she won the fight against her stomach and let out a shaky breath. Bolton wrinkled his nose.

​    “Brush your teeth,” he said with a grimace. “You’re making my coffee taste bad with your alcoholic breath.”

​    “Oh, fuck this,” she growled, as the world pitched under her, and she nearly fell to the hardwood floor. She gathered her mind for a moment, spinning her mana to life and casting her Light Restoration skill. At once, her entire body was suffused by a gentle white light. It purged the lingering effects of the alcohol from her system quickly, including the sore muscles and even the foul taste in her mouth. After about ten seconds of channeling the skill, she opened her eyes and let out a sigh of relief.

​    “Cheater,” Bolton grumbled. “You should suffer the consequences of your actions. Why do you insist on stealing my fun?”

​    “If your fun came from a source other than my misery, I might be willing to,” she shot back, now perfectly clear-headed. “Dennis, can I have some breakfast, please?”

​    As she waited for her food to arrive, she allowed herself to get lost in her thoughts, staring idly out the window at the busy street while her fingers tapped lightly upon the wood. That boy… What had his name been? Grip? Grom? Grim! He’d been an interesting one. A child of Evandross, slumming it in The *Barrel's Bottom*, the cheapest and roughest of all delver taverns in Beastwick? She’d never seen such a thing. What was more, he seemed… damaged. As if life had dealt some kind of cruel hand to him, and he’d known nothing but neglect in his existence.

​    “That boy,” she said slowly, still staring out the window. “Do you think he’ll come back before we leave?”

​    “Maybe. You weren’t exactly at your most charming last night.”

​    She kissed her teeth at that, but couldn’t deny the claim. “He was… interesting.”

​    “I noticed,” Bolton said, finally sounding serious. “His silver hair… That’s usually a mark of a Child of Evandross, isn’t it? What in the pits was he doing in a place like this?”

​    “That’s what I wanted to know,” she replied, lightly scratching an itch on her knee. ”Almost all of them are in some minor noble house or another. Even the orphans with no surviving relatives bonded with another of their kin.”

​    Bolton nodded in agreement. “There’s no reason that he’d need to be here. But then, you knew that he was going to join the Compass Rose, didn’t you?”

​    Veyra’s lip curled at the mention of that soft, noble-filled excuse of a guild. They had no idea what it really took to be an Expeditioner, at least not for the last century or so. Without the threat of untamed dungeons nearby, they’d grown complacent and lax. Even a single level three dungeon flood would wreck this city. Hundreds would die before they could counter the attack.

​    “That was a lucky guess,” she admitted. “I thought he looked young, and he had that silver cross.”

​    “Could be a noble plant,” Bolton offered. “I wouldn’t put it past those fops to know about this place, even if they’re too dim to know about all the smuggling.”

​    “Nah,” she said, sounding firmer this time. “You didn’t see him closely, Bolt. The boy nearly jumped out of his skin when I touched him, and he was nervous as a rat at a cheese party. He was all skin and bones. No way he’d be like that if he’d been living the high life.”

​    Dennis appeared from the kitchen with a plate laden with food for her, and she abandoned her thoughtful mutterings to devour the food. The eggs were perfectly cooked–just runny enough to let the yolk spill out across the tater hash, leaving a little to be mopped up by the sourdough toast. “Mmm. Perfect as always, Dennis.”

​    The chef rolled his eyes at the compliment. “That’s not gonna make up for the trouble you cause when you start drinking, Veyra. I don’t mind if you seek a companion for the night, but don’t go scaring off my patrons. That boy’s been staying here a few days now, and he’s a good lad.”

​    “He’s still here?” Veyra asked, her head snapping up. She glanced around the room for a moment, her meal forgotten, but there was no sign of the silver-haired boy around them.

​    “Not at the moment,” Dennis told her, frowning at her sudden renewed interest. “He got a dawn shift at one of the level three dungeons, and had to leave early to meet up with his party.”

​    Veyra hummed thoughtfully at that, then dismissed Dennis with a wave of her hand. The chef shrugged, then returned to his kitchen, waving in response to the called requests for more food and drink from his other patrons. Veyra stared down at her plate as if the answer to her brain worm might be hiding there, under the shredded taters. What was it about the boy that so intrigued her? Sure, Children of Evandross were rare–barely fifty of them had survived the fall of their settlement–but not so uncommon that a lone member would be so… interesting.

​    “Don’t,” Bolton said in a low voice. There was a growl of annoyance to his words, and she looked up at him through her lashes and batted her eyes. “No. We don’t have time. I forbid it.”

​    She snorted at that, but said nothing further as she focused on the remnants of her meal. He’d forget she had the idea soon, she thought, enjoying the greasy food. But she felt the continued pressure of his eyes on her face. She pretended not to notice.

​    “I’m your Captain,” she said finally, popping the last piece of toast, coated in that warm yolk, into her mouth. She brushed her hands clean and plunked two silver coins onto the table, then stood. “Let’s go see what he’s about.”

​    Bolton stared at her incredulously for a moment. Sometimes… Sometimes, he wished he’d gone with a different guild years ago when he’d chosen the life of a delver. Even if he couldn’t explore new dungeons, his life would have been so much easier without this woman as his captain. After she turned toward the door, he realized her mind was set and got up with a sigh to follow, leaving his own payment behind as well. Sure, the boy was interesting. But was it really worth veering from their tight schedule?",1,1762570852.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Grim’s first offer came after his lunch at the local cheap delver inn. He’d just finished emptying his plate when someone slid into the other side of his private booth and offered him a smile. Without so much as a greeting or offer to join him, she simply leaned back and kicked her feet up onto the table, taking a long draft from the mug of frothy ale she was holding in one hand, and pointed at him with the other.

​    “Come on, kid, cheer up! You’re ruining Dennis’ high-class meal!”

​    Grim lifted his head slowly, contemplating the woman. It was the first time someone had ever approached him in such a direct, informal way. Did she have no idea of how things operated in this city? At the very least, she should have asked to sit beside him. But to blow past that entirely, and then to presume to tell him how to act? It was clear in about a second that this woman was not from Beastwick. That was confirmed as he took in her uniform– light leather and a green half-cape bearing some kind of cross symbol. On her left breast were the double bars of a Captain.

​    “Captain Veyra Tull,” she told him, offering a slanted grin. So she did know some of the usual manners, Grim thought.

​    “Good evening, Captain,” he replied, thinking that he should at least start out the conversation with a polite tone. At the very least, he didn’t want a Captain as his enemy. “How may I help you?”

​    “I recognized your tunic,” she spoke, sounding as if she’d barely listened to his greeting. She took a long pull from her tankard, and for a moment, Grim thought that was all she would say. But after a few seconds, when she’d completely drained the golden ale, she slammed it down and leaned back further in her chair. “So. Which of this city’s pompous guilds are you applying to?”

​    There was… something in the way she said ‘this city’ that caught Grim’s attention. Was that scorn in her voice? “Are you not from Beastwick?”

​    Her shoulders shook in gentle humor. “Oh, you nearly offend me, kid. What’s your name?”

​    “Grim Kestrel.”

​    Captain Veyra Tull leaned further back in the rickety tavern chair, its legs creaking ominously as she peered owlishly down the length of her nose at him. In others, the gesture indicated a sense of superiority. But with this woman, he felt more like a rat, pinned effortlessly by some bird of prey, its fate up to the whim of a creature who tried to decide if he was food or merely a toy.

​    “Not Grimveil, eh? I would’ve thought that a Child of Evandross would try to honor his legacy as much as possible.”

​    Grim didn’t reply at once, favoring her with a slow blink. “Grim Grimveil would hardly roll off the tongue, *captain*.” He put a little emphasis on her title to politely indicate that he wasn’t interested in discussing this topic.

​    “Too true,” she agreed. “But Kestrel… Like a hawk. I like that.”

​    Without warning, she withdrew her feet from the table, letting her chair crash back down onto all fours, and got up. He looked up hopefully, thinking she had gotten his hint and was going to leave him in peace for the rest of the night. Instead, she slid neatly into the booth beside him. She was built like him–short and lean–but had a wiry sort of strength, easily able to check him to one side. “Dennis! Another ale, and one for my new friend Grim!”

​    Grim tried to subtly slide away out of habit, but she threw an arm around him and pulled him back tight against her as if they were old friends. The gesture was casual enough, but her arm was like an iron bar, pressing insistently against his neck. Again, he had that strong impression of being small, pinned by some kind of bird of prey.

​    “Hold on now, Grim,” she said. “Let’s get to know each other a little better. I told you my name, but I haven’t really introduced myself, have I?”

​    “Ease up on the boy’s neck, Veyra,” the barkeep Dennis said as he approached. He held another large tankard for the woman in one hand, and a mug of steaming coffee in the other. “I’ll write Orren if you scare off any more of my patrons.”

​    The corner of Veyra’s mouth tilted down in a slight pout, then curled upward. “Like that threat means anything to me. My beloved fiancée knows me too well to try and change me now.”

​    She accepted the tankard with a word of thanks, then shooed Dennis away with the hand draped over Grim’s shoulders. For a moment, Dennis seemed like he’d argue, meeting Grim’s eyes to gauge his reaction. Grim could only shrug helplessly, and he accepted the situation, retreating–escaping–to the bar once again.

​    “So, as I said, I’m Captain Veyra Tull,” the woman said, after draining nearly a quarter of the tankard and letting out a belch. “I’m with the Ironmarsh Cartographers.”

​    Ah, Grim thought. Ironmarsh. That went a long way toward explaining her complete disregard for social niceties and general manners. It was said that people from that mountain town were… well, it was said that they were savages, possessing no more manners than a common street rat. Of course, as a street rat in the capital himself, he knew better than to put his full trust in such rumors. But the few people from Ironmarsh he had met seemed to suggest some merit to the idea. And this woman definitely lacked the subtle ways of a delver in Beastwick.

​    He studied her out of the corner of his eye, noting with some surprise that she couldn’t have been more than a few years older than him. Twenty-five at the oldest, if he’d had to guess. And she was a Captain? The third-highest rank available in a guild wasn’t exactly rare, but it took serious skill and experience to earn even that title. She certainly didn’t seem like the type.

​    “Ironmarsh Cartographers?” He asked, still striving to sound polite, at least as far as he could. The name wasn’t familiar to him, but then again, he knew so little about her city beyond the rumors of savagery that tumbled out of the mouths of local gossips. “So, I’m guessing you’re an Expedition Guild.”

​    “That’s right!” She exclaimed, smiling broadly at him, her brown eyes suddenly becoming warmer, more… inviting. It suddenly struck Grim that Veyra was quite pretty, with large brown eyes, a round face, and a slightly sarcastic smirk that hinted at a great sense of humor. Coupled with her slender, cat-like frame… He jerked his eyes back toward his empty plate, willing himself not to allow his mind down that route.

​    “We’re the only Expedition guild in Ironmarsh,” she said with a laugh like warm honey. “Of course, we ain’t got feeder guilds and all that like Beastwick. We all gotta work together to keep our tribe safe.”

​    “Right,” he said slowly, and tried to gently put a little distance between them once more. Again, she stopped the attempt, so he gave a quiet sigh. “How can I help you, Captain?”

​    Something about the way her eyes tightened at that question told him she had a strong dislike of formal discussion. “You’re attempting to join the Compass Rose, aren’t you?”

​    The unexpected guess caught him off guard, and he accidentally inhaled a little of his coffee. Emerging from his mug with a spluttering cough, he glanced at her again, this time with a little more nervous energy. “How did you know that? Have you been spying on me?”

​    “Hardly,” she drawled, then drained more of her ale. “You haven’t proven interesting enough to warrant my attention… yet. I came over because I thought you were a pretty boy, but now…”

​    Some of her flirty demeanor faded away, and her eyes narrowed as they flicked up and down, taking him in. He knew his face was flushing at the ‘pretty boy’ comment, but he tried to keep his features under control. “Yes, I suppose you could be good… If you were pushed.”

​    The hand not holding him prisoner set the tankard down and slid down to her hip, where a knife and pouch sat together. For one bewildered moment, he thought she was going to draw the weapon, but her long fingers instead slipped into the pouch and retrieved two gold coins. That was enough money for a night’s worth of drinks, Grim thought with muted panic. How long was she going to stay here, forcing him into an uncomfortable encounter?

​    “Nope!” A new voice made both him and Veyra jump, and a man stepped into view. He was tall and broad, with a powerful sort of frame that felt out of place without armor to wrap around him. His hair and beard–both the dusty red of a dying fire– were neatly trimmed, and his green eyes had a kind, thoughtful look to them, though they were currently narrowed in annoyance. Without any sort of greeting or introduction, he leaned down and plucked Veyra away by her collar, as if she were a child caught in mischief.

​    “Ack!” she spluttered, immediately struggling, her feet flailing wildly and catching her tankard, sending it flying across the room. “Bolton, put me down!”

​    “I can’t even use the toilet without you trying to bed some innocent local!” The man chided. He wore the same dark green half cape as Veyra, though his uniform was bereft of any special signs that indicated a higher rank.

​    “Put me down!” She screeched, now slung over his shoulder like a particularly angry sack of potatoes. She pounded on his back with her clenched fists, but he didn’t seem to notice. “I was not trying to bed him! I’m recruiting! I am your captain! Put. Me. Down!”

​    The man, Bolton, favored Grim with a faintly sheepish grin. “Sorry about that, lad. She forgets her manners quickly when she’s had a few ales. Hope she didn’t ruin too much of your night.”

​    Grim opened his mouth to reply, but the absurdity of the situation robbed him of anything to say. The Captain, quite a few years younger than the man currently holding her legs pinned to prevent them flailing, thrashed indignantly over his shoulder, doing her utmost to break his spine with her small fists. She suddenly seemed a lot less intimidating and a lot younger.

​    “It’s… fine,” he finally managed to croak out. It was all he could do not to laugh at the red-faced woman as Bolton turned. Her brown eyes were full of righteous indignation now, and she wrenched at the man’s cloak, either trying to throttle him with it or use it as a purchase to try and break free. “I… uh… thanks.”

​    Veyra suddenly went still as her eyes met Grim’s, and a slow, mischievous grin spread across her face. She put a hand against Bolton’s back and released a surge of electricity that jumped from her fingers to the man’s back. He stiffened and let out a grunt, but refused to loosen his grip on her, and simply walked away, carrying his recalcitrant Captain with him. “I hope you can enjoy the rest of your night in more peace. Dennis, please give him another serving on us!”

​    “Roger that, Bolton,” Dennis called back. Grim could see the look of relief on the barkeep’s face as he watched the wiry woman resume her frantic attempts to break free. “Make sure she throws up outside! I’ve upped my cleaning fee since last time!”

​    Bolton let out a laugh, a deep, sonorous sound that almost seemed to shake the plates on nearby tables. “Don’t worry, we’ll make sure this little noble rat doesn’t cause you any more trouble. I’m sure she doesn’t want Orren to make her race lines again.”

​    Veyra froze again, but she wasn’t acting this time. Her eyes were wide and fearful, and she visibly shrank. Quite a few of the patrons–and Dennis included–laughed at her transformation from feral cat to meek kitten. There was still much of the pout about her, though, and she let out an indignant noise before turning to face Grim again.

​    “Come find me when you want a real challenge, Grim Kestrel,” she said. Despite being draped over Bolton’s shoulder like a naughty schoolgirl being dragged away by a disappointed parent, her eyes had that sharp glint to them again. “You’re not going to get what you want in this city, or in the Compass Rose! I’ll be here all week, so make sure you come and find me when those fools reject you!”",1,1762570742.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1oreai4,https://i.redd.it/08x4s1l57yzf1.jpeg,Friday Vertical,"I am a huge fan of El Tesoro and find myself going back to it time and again. A few weeks ago I picked up the XA and have been waiting to finish another bottle to crack it open. Buuut I just came from a bar where I gave Fuenteseca a try (looking to buy myself a nice birthday bottle for my 40th in January, tried Tears and Fuenteseca Blanco so far, open to other recs) and was tipsy enough to say fuck it, let’s do a vertical at home.

Copying some of this from a previous post and updating with my XA tasting notes:

The ET blanco is a workhorse. It’s a great sipper, it’s excellent in a margarita and it’s my go-to for a ranch water or basic tequila soda. It’s probably my favorite blanco to have on hand just given its versatility alone. It’s got bright agave all around, just this side of creamy and has that distinctive hint of ET cinnamon coming through. A nice smooth finish that hides a little minty grassiness and earthiness at the tail end there. Solid tequila. Sip it, mix it, always keep it in hand.

With ET repo, I get hit with creamy caramel right away, which is delicious. More assertive than other repos I’ve had which isn’t all that many, so take that with a grain of salt. The agave is mellowed quite a bit if that matters to you a whole lot. It’s there, but not with main character energy. Your usual repo suspects of vanilla and caramel dominate in the middle, but the finish is not unlike the blanco. Much mellower, less grassiness, still a nice bit of dirt at the end.

The ET anejo is doing something extra special, holy cow. I immediately want to make a tequila old fashioned with this, using agave syrup. It’s a pretty smooth blend of vanilla, caramel and brown sugar with a tiny hint of mint. The agave is kind of hiding throughout; definitely there but it’s now just a part of the whole profile - in a good way. There’s just a touch of smoke at the end as well, which I’m not sure yet if I like or not. The finish is not sharp. It’s smooth and long lasting, with anise lingering towards the end.

If the ET anejo is standing out as special, the XA is like its demure older sister. Just as special, but you’re going to have to hang with it to appreciate its depths. First, it needs to sit for minute after you pour. A solid 10-15 minutes will help it breathe and open up. Once it does, you get coffee, burnt caramel, and sugar on the nose that carries right into its tasting notes, adding chocolate to the list on the palate. It’s creamy, smooth and a joy to savor. Somehow, they’ve managed to keep the agave bright, but it has definitely taken a noticeable backseat in this final expression and the earthiness is pretty much gone at this point. The smoke near the end from the anejo is gone, which I like and can now say I do appreciate the lack of smoke vs a touch of smokiness that I found I the anejo. This one is *dangerously* easy to sip, and the finish stays with you for quite some time. I’m tasting it ten minutes after my last sip.

If I were forced to rank in order across all factors - price, quality, taste, versatility - I’d say Anejo, Blanco, XA and then Repo. The blanco and XA are pretty much tied though, because I’m using them in completely different scenarios, but I lean towards a blanco across the board so it edges ahead in my bar.

That said, I love them all and could see keeping this entire vertical in stock at all times. ET for the win all around!

The sugar skull glasses are a new addition to my bar as well; a nice little surprise gift from my daughter. I hear they are on sale for half price at Williams and Sonoma.

I just want to thank this amazing group. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I only found out about this group two weeks ago 😅 — and it’s been incredibly helpful with all your comments and posts!

As a way of giving back, here’s my PMP journey.

⸻

🧩 Background

I’ve only been a Project Manager for 2 years in a Pharmaceutical company, and I came from a solid finance operations background. Project Management is still pretty new to me, and honestly, I took the PMP to reduce my imposter syndrome and specialize in something I truly enjoy doing.

The journey wasn’t easy. I suffered from severe insomnia for 2 weeks before the exam. During the final week, I tried everything — melatonin, magnesium glycinate, even Benadryl — but my mind just wouldn’t stop racing. The lack of sleep gave me migraines and brain fog. Thankfully, on exam day, I got 4–5 hours of sleep, no migraines, and a clear head. I took that as a good sign. 🙏

⸻

📚 My Study Journey (Started around end of July)

📘 Rita Mulcahy Book (Online)
Read it cover to cover. It’s simple, easy to follow, and really helped me understand the fundamentals.

📗 1000+ Practice Exam Book
A friend gave me this, and I started practicing with it early on. It helped me connect the dots and understand how concepts link together.

💻 PMI Study Hall (SH)
I saw so many reviews about this on Facebook, so I gave it a try. Dude, it was HARD!
My mini exams ranged from 40–80%, and my mock exam scores were 74%, 65%, 68%, and 62%. My confidence was at an all-time low two weeks before the exam 😭.

📝 ThirdRock Notes
Discovered this group’s recommendation after my 3rd mock exam and decided to buy it. It filled a lot of knowledge gaps! I read it thoroughly the day before my exam — not just the cheat sheet. It really helped me recall key concepts and terms (especially for drag-and-drop questions).

⸻

🧠 Exam Day (PearsonVUE Makati – Morning Schedule)

I took both breaks, but I accidentally overbreaked during the first one. Since there are no clocks, I didn’t realize it — so be careful! When I started the second set, my remaining time dropped from 154 mins to 153 mins. Lesson learned: overbreaks eat into your exam time ⏰

For snacks, I brought chocolate mallows, KitKat, Pocari Sweat, and Mountain Dew (I can’t drink coffee right now).

I was super nervous the whole time. My heart was racing, so I had to reread each question several times. The questions were quite different from SH — shorter, yes, but trickier because most options looked wrong. 😂
You just have to pick the “best” answer.

I got 6 drag-and-drop questions (which ate up my time 😭), no math questions (sad accountant moment), and around 3–4 multiple-answer questions. A mix of predictive, agile, and hybrid.

Mindsets help, but they’re not everything. Some questions didn’t make sense, and I had to logically eliminate and escalate in my head to choose the least-wrong option.

⸻

🎉 The Results

Surprisingly, I passed with AT-T-AT! Never expected it because after my exam, I wasn’t given any paper. I finished around 2 PM and received the results at 2 AM the next day.

When I saw the PMI email, I was crying! I honestly thought it was just some random badge notification like on Facebook 🤣 — but nope, it was THE email.

It still amazes me because my SH mock averages were just pretty average, and I was always low in People and Business Environment but high in Process. So that was really weird, but hey — thankful and relieved that it all worked out. 🙏

If I managed to do it with those scores, you absolutely can too — and even go Above Target! 💪

⸻

💡 My Advice:
	•	✍️ Write your formulas or notes on your scratch sheet right at the start.
	•	⏱️ Write down your time strategy (e.g., 155–80) since watches and visible clocks aren’t allowed.
	•	🧩 Practice in SH or any mock exam platform to build stamina for a 4-hour test.
	•	🔍 Review your wrong answers — don’t just memorize, understand why.
	•	⚠️ Know your risk management, stakeholder strategies, and tools well.
	•	📖 Don’t sleep on ThirdRock Notes — read it end-to-end, not just the cheat sheet.
	•	🙏 And most importantly, pray.

I finished with 16 minutes left, reviewed flagged items, and prayed before hitting Submit. I told God, “If it’s for me, let Your will be done.”

⸻

🏁 Final Thoughts:

You got this!
Trust your prep, be calm (unlike me 😂), and don’t be discouraged by low mock scores — let them push you harder. I can’t give a “safe” average, but I can say this: keep the faith and leave the rest to God.

God bless and good luck, future PMPs! 💪🎓",9,1762570062.0,pmp,4,1.0,False

I met a super cool nurse on Saturday, November 1, at River Park Square. I was watching my friends table near the escalator, probably sometime between 1 and 3… I think the sun was still out. She’s a nurse, and I helped her with the coolest black t-shirt, though ""helped"" might be generous. I was fumbling to make change and probably sounded just as clumsy trying to keep the conversation going.

I asked if she had a connection to the shirt and she started telling me about her Ancestry dna finds, things she learned about her mom's side of the family, and I'd really like to hear the rest of the story. She has an easy laugh and a way of asking questions that is thoughtful and curious. I wish I'd said so much more. So here I am, almost a week later, and I wish I'd said, ""Hey, want to grab coffee or lunch and finish this conversation sometime soon?"" But the moment slipped by before I caught my breath or started thinking. Regardless, I shared the story behind the shirt she bought and thought I saw a spark in her eyes as she listened. She even came back to say goodbye, and I still didn't say what I wanted to. I'm slow sometimes. And I I bounce between thinking ""maybe she'd say yes,"" and ""ok dude, you are totally misreading the scene."" 

If you were that cool nurse and also felt like there was a little more than casual small talk energy there, I'd love the chance to continue our discussion a bit more properly. Over coffee or lunch, or a walk in the tail end of the fall sunshine. I'd love to hear the rest of the story and maybe share some of mine. Even if it was just small talk and an over-read, I'd love to hear more of the story. 

And if she never sees this or doesn't want to talk, I hope that shirt's already had a few good outings and brings her a smile every time she wears it.",13,1762570040.0,Spokane,5,0.76,False

I’ve been making pour over for a few years now. I live in a place where local coffee shops are abundant. I’m not as deep or passionate about the hobby as it appears some people in this subreddit are, I just like enjoying local beans and pour over is my favorite way to make it. 

I’ve mostly been using my roommates kettles and I’ve been going without a scale, however it’s time to buy my own now. I domt want to cheap out, but I also don’t feel like I need a $200 scale or kettle.

I have a nice hand grinder and a Chemex. Considering buying the Hario switch too, just to try something new.

1ordz18,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestkitchentool/comments/1ordz18/unlock_your_dishwashers_full_potential_the/,Unlock Your Dishwasher's Full Potential: The Secrets to Flawless Dishes Every Time,"Let's be honest. We've all been there. You open the dishwasher after a full cycle, expecting a cascade of sparkling clean dishes, only to be met with cloudy glasses, a greasy film on your plates, or—you guessed it—a spoon with a mysterious blob still stuck to it.

It's frustrating. You might think your dishwasher is on its last legs, or that you just got a dud. But what if I told you that your machine is probably fine? The real issue is often a few small, easily fixable habits.

This isn't about buying a new, expensive appliance. This is about finally mastering the one you already have. Let's turn that frustrating box into the workhorse it was meant to be.

---

## The ""Scrape, Don't Rinse"" Golden Rule

This is the single biggest mistake people make. We have this instinct to pre-wash our dishes before they even go in the dishwasher. Stop it right there.

Modern dishwasher detergents are designed with enzymes that *need* food particles to latch onto and break down. If you rinse your dishes until they're spotless, the detergent has nothing to work with. It essentially just sloshes around and can even etch your glassware over time, leading to permanent cloudiness.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dishwasher)

> **Your new mantra: Scrape the solids, leave the smears.**

Use a spatula or your fork to get big chunks of food into the trash or compost. A little sauce, a few crumbs, or a bit of cheese is not just okay—it's *necessary* for a proper clean.

---

## The Art of Loading: A Game-Changer

How you load the dishwasher matters more than you think. It’s not a game of Tetris where the only goal is to fit everything in. It's about strategically placing items so they get hit by the water jets.

### Top Rack Real Estate

This is your delicate zone. The water pressure is a bit gentler up here.

-   **Glasses and Mugs:** Place them on the tines facing *down and in* towards the center. The main water spray arm is usually at the bottom, so angling them inward ensures the inside gets a thorough cleaning.
-   **Small Bowls:** Tilt them forward on the tines. This helps water run off and prevents them from pooling with dirty water.
-   **Plastics:** Always place plastic items on the top rack unless your dishwasher's manual says otherwise. The heating element is on the bottom, and you don't want melted plastic.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dishwasher)

### Bottom Rack Power Players

This is the heavy-duty zone.

-   **Plates:** Face them *inwards* towards the center spray arm. Never let a large plate block the arm's rotation.
-   **Pots and Pans:** Place them upside down. Make sure they are secure and won't collect water.
-   **Utensils with Long Handles:** Lay them down horizontally to ensure they don't block the spray arm.

### The Silverware Basket Puzzle

Don't just throw all your forks in one compartment.

-   **Mix it up:** Place some forks handle-up, some handle-down. Do the same with spoons. This prevents them from ""nesting"" together, which shields them from the water and detergent.
-   **Knives:** For safety, always place sharp knives handle-down. Better yet, if you have a third-rack utensil tray, use that.

---

## Beyond the Detergent: The Unsung Heroes

Detergent is just one part of the equation. If you're only using pods or powder, you're missing out on a flawless finish.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dishwasher)

### Are You Using Rinse Aid?

If you're not, you need to start. Rinse aid is not a gimmick. It's a surfactant that reduces the surface tension of water. This means instead of forming droplets that leave mineral spots behind, water sheets right off your dishes.

The result? Drier dishes, especially plastics, and *zero* hard water spots on your glassware. It's the difference between ""clean"" and ""sparkling.""

### The One Tool That Changed Everything for Me: The Dishwasher Cleaner

This is the thing I wish I had found years sooner. You clean your oven, you clean your coffee maker, but do you ever clean your dishwasher?

Over time, grease, limescale, and food sludge build up in the hidden parts of your machine—the filters, the spray arms, the internal pipes. This buildup is often the real culprit behind smelly dishes and poor performance.

Every couple of months, run a cleaning cycle with a dedicated dishwasher cleaner. These are formulated to break down that gunk without damaging the machine's components. It's not the same as running an empty cycle with vinegar, which can be too harsh on rubber seals. After the first time I used one, the difference was staggering. The machine was quieter, and the dishes came out noticeably cleaner. It felt like I had a brand-new appliance.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dishwasher)

---

## Choosing Your Cycle Wisely

Don't just default to ""Normal"" and walk away. Your machine has different cycles for a reason.

-   **Auto/Smart:** This is your best friend. Modern dishwashers have sensors that detect how dirty the water is. They'll adjust the water temperature and cycle time accordingly. It’s surprisingly efficient.
-   **Heavy Duty:** Use this for caked-on, baked-on foods. It uses hotter water and runs longer.
-   **Quick Wash:** Perfect for lightly soiled dishes that you need in a pinch.
-   ** sanitize:** Great for baby bottles, cutting boards, or when someone in the house is sick. It uses extra-hot water to kill germs.

By understanding your dishwasher's language—scraping instead of rinsing, loading with intention, and using the right helpers—you can get consistently perfect results. It’s less work for you and a much better outcome for your dishes.

1ordtia,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ordtia/hr_spooks/,[HR] Spooks,"It was a busy intersection and the weather was bad, but Donald Miller was out there, knocking on car windows while holding a sign that said:

    single dad
    out of work
    2 kids
    please help

He was thirty-four years old.

He'd been homeless for almost two years.

He knocked on a driver's side window and the driver shook her head, not even making eye contact. The next lowered his window and told him to get a fucking job. Sometimes people asked where his kids were while he was out here. It was a fair question. Sometimes they spat at him. Sometimes they got really pissed because they had to work hard for their dime while he was out here begging for it. *A leech on society. A deadbeat. A liar. A fraud, a cheat, a swindler, a drain on the better elements of the world.* But usually they just ignored him. Once in a while they gave him some money, and that was what happened now as a woman distastefully held a ten-dollar bill out the window. “Thank you, ma'am,” said Miller, taking it. “Feed your children,” said the woman. Then the light changed from red to green and the woman drove off. Miller stepped off the street onto the paved shoulder, waited for the next red light, the next group of cars, and repeated.

“It's almost Fordian,” said Spector.

Nevis nodded, pouring coffee from a paper cup into his mouth. “Mhm.”

The pair of them were observing Miller through binoculars from behind the tinted windshield of their black spook car, parked an inconspicuous distance away. Spector continued: “It's like capitalism's chewed him up for so long he's applied capitalist praxis to panhandling. I mean, look: it’s a virtual assembly line, and there he dutifully goes, station to demeaning station, for an entire shift.”

“Yeah,” said Nevis.

The traffic lights changed a few times.

The radio played Janis Joplin.

“So,” said Nevis, holding an empty paper coffee cup, “you sure he's our guy?”

“I'm sure. No wife, no kids, no friends or relatives.”

“Ain't what his sign says.”

“Today.”

“Yeah, today.”

(Yesterday, Miller had been stranded in the city after getting mugged and needed money to get back to Pittsburgh, but that apparently didn't pull as hard on the heartstrings.)

“And you said he was in the army?”

“Sure was.”

“What stripe was he?”

“Didn't get past first, so I wouldn't count on his conditioning too much.”

“Didn't consider him suitable—or what?”

“Got tossed out before they could get the hooks into his head. Couldn't keep his opinions on point or to himself. Spoke his mind. *Independent thinker.*” Nevis grinned. “But there's more. Something I haven't told you. Here,” he said, tossing a fat file folder onto Spector’s lap.

Spector stuck a toothpick in his mouth and looked through the documents.

“Check his school records,” said Nevis.

Spector read them. “Good grades. No disciplinary problems. Straight through to high school graduation.”

“Check the district.”

Spector bit his toothpick so hard it cracked. He spat out the pieces. “This is almost too good. North Mayfield Public School Board, Cincinnati, Ohio—and, oh shit, class of 1952. That's where we test-ran *Idiom*, isn't it?”

“Uh huh,” said Nevis.

Spector picked up his binoculars and watched Miller beg for a few moments.

Nevis continued: “Simplants. False memories. LSD-laced fruit juice. Mass hypnosis. From what I've heard, it was a real fucking mental playground over there.”

“They shut it down in what, fifty-four?”

“Fifty-three. A lot of the guys who worked there went on to *Ultra* and *Monarch*. Some fell off the edge entirely, so you know what that means.”

“And a lot of the subjects ended up dead, or worse—didn't they?”

“Not our guy, though.”

“No.”

“Not yet anyway.” They both laughed, and they soon drove away.

It had started raining, and Donald Miller kept going up to car after car, holding his cardboard sign, now wet and starting to fall apart, collecting spare change from the spared kindness of strangers.

A few days later a black car pulled up to the same intersection. Donald Miller walked up to it and knocked on the driver's side window. Spector was behind the wheel. “Spare any money?” asked Donald Miller, showing his sign, which today said he had one child but that child had a form of cancer whose treatment Miller couldn't afford.

“No, but I can spare you a job,” said Spector.

“A job. *What?*” said Miller.

“Yes. I'm offering you work, Donald.”

“What kind of—hey, how-the-hell do you know my name, huh!”

“Relax, Donald. Get in.”

“No,” said Miller, backing slowly away, almost into another vehicle, whose driver **honked.** Donald jumped. “Don't you want to hear my offer?” asked Spector.

“I don't have the skills for no job, man. Do you think if I had the skills I'd be out here doing this shit?”

“You've already demonstrated the two basic requirements: standing and holding a sign. You're qualified. Now get in the car, please.”

“The *fuck* is this?”

Spector smiled. “Donald, Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office.”

“What, you're fucking crazy, man,” said Miller, his body tensing up, a change coming over his eyes and a self-disbelief over his face. “Who the fuck is—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald. Please get in the car.”

Miller opened his mouth, looked briefly toward the sky, then crossed to the other side of the car, opened the passenger side door, and sat politely beside Spector. When he was settled, Nevis—from the back seat—threw a thick hood over his head and stuck him with a syringe.

Donald Miller woke up naked next to a pile of drab dockworkers’ clothes and a bag of money. He was disoriented, afraid, and about to run when Spector grabbed his arm. “It's all right, Donald,” he said. “You don't need to be afraid. You're in Principal Lewis’ office now. He has a job for you to do. Just put on those clothes.”

“Put them on and do what?”

Miller was looking at the bag of money. He noted
other people here, including a man in a dark suit, and several people with cameras and film equipment. “Like I said before, all you have to do is hold a sign.”

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald. You accepted and willingly got in the car with me. You don't remember the ride because you feel asleep. You were very tired. We didn't want to wake you until you were rested.”

Miller breathed heavily. “Job doing what?”

“Holding a sign.”

“OK, and what's the sign say?”

“It doesn't say anything, Donald—completely blank—just as Principal Lewis likes it.”

“And the clothes, do I get to keep the clothes after we're done. Because you took my old clothes, you…”

“You’ll get new clothes,” said Spector.

“And Principal Lewis wants me to put on these clothes and hold the completely blank sign, and then I’ll get paid and get new clothes?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

So, for the next two weeks, Donald Miller put on various kinds of working clothes, held blank signs, sometimes walked, sometimes stood still, sometimes opened his mouth and sometimes closed it, sometimes sat, or lay down on the ground; or on the floor, because he did all these things in different locations, inside and outside: on an empty factory floor, in a muddy field, on a stretch of traffic-less road. And all the while they took photographs of him and filmed him, and he never knew what any of it meant, why he was doing it. They only spoke to give him directions: “Look angry,” “Pretend you’re starving,” “Look like someone’s about to push you in the back,” “like you’re jostling for position,” “like you’ve had enough and you just can’t fucking take it anymore and whatever you want you’re gonna have to fight for it!”

Then it was over.

Spector shook his hand, they bought him a couple of outfits, paid him his money and sent him on his way. “Sorry, we have to do it this way, but—”

Donald Miller found himself at night in a motel room rented under a name he didn’t recognise, with a printed note saying he could stay as long as he liked. He stayed two days before buying a bus ticket back to Cincinnati, where he was from. He lived well there for a while. The money wasn’t insignificant, and he spent it with restraint, but even the new clothes and money couldn’t wipe the stain of homelessness off him, and he couldn’t convince anyone to give him a job. Less than a year later he was back on the streets begging.

The whole episode—because that’s how he thought about it—was clouded by creamy surreality, which just thickened as time went by until it seemed like it had been a dream, as distant as his time in high school.

One day, several years later, Donald Miller was standing outside an electronics shop, the kind with all the new televisions set up in the display window by the street and turned so that all who passed by could see them and watch and marvel and need to have a set of his own. Miller was watching daytime programming on one of the sets when the broadcast *on all the sets,* which had been showing a few different stations—*cut suddenly to a news alert:*

A few people stopped to watch alongside.

“What’s going on?” a man asked.

“I don’t know,” said Miller.

*On the screens, a handsome news reporter was solemnly reading out a statement about anti-government protests happening in some communist country in eastern Europe. “...they marched again today, in the hundreds of thousands, shouting, ‘We want bread! We want freedom!’ and holding signs denouncing the current regime and imploring the West—and the United States specifically—for help.”* There was more, but Miller had stopped listening. There rose a ***thumping-coursing*** followed by a ***ringing*** in his ears. And his eyes were focused on *the faces of the protestors in the photos and clips the news reporter was speaking over:* because they were his face: **all of them were his face!**

“Hey!” Miller yelled.

The people gathered at the electronics store window looked over at him. “You all right there, buddy?” one asked.

“Don’t you see: it’s me.”

“What’s you?”

“There—” He pointed with a shaking finger at one of the television sets. “—me.”

“Which one, honey?” a woman asked, chuckling.

Miller grabbed her by the shoulders, startling her, saying: “All of them. All of them are me.” And, looking back at the set, he started hitting the display window with his hand. “That one and that one, and that one. That one, that one, that one…”

He grew hysterical, violent; but the people on the street worked together to subdue him, and the owner of the electronics store called the police. The police picked him up, asked him a few questions and drove him to a mental institution. They suggested he stay here, “just for a few days, until you’re better,” and when he insisted he didn’t want to stay there, they changed their suggestion to a command backed by the law and threatened him with charges: assault, resisting arrest, loitering, vagrancy.

Donald Miller was in the institution when the President came on the television and in a serious address to the nation declared that the United States of America, a God fearing and freedom loving people, could no longer stand idly by while another people, equally deserving of freedom, yearning for it, was systematically oppressed. Those people, the President said, would now be saved and welcomed into the arms of the West. After that, the President declared war on the country in which Donald Miller had seen himself protesting against the government.

Once the shock of it passed, being committed wasn’t so bad. It was warm, there was free food and free television, and most of the nurses were nice enough. Sure, there were crazies in there, people who’d bang their heads against the wall or speak in made-up languages, but not everyone was like that, and it was easy to avoid the ones who were. The doctors were the worst part: not because they were cruel but because they were cold, and all they ever did was ask questions and make notes and never tell you what the notes were about. Eventually he even confided in one doctor, a young woman named Angeline, and told her the truth about what had happened to him. He talked to Angeline more often after that, which was fine with him. Then, unexpectedly, Angelina was gone and a man with a buzzcut came to talk to him. “Who are you?” Miller asked. “My name’s Fitzsimmons.” “Are you a doctor?” “No, I’m not a doctor. I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as he *really* loses it.”

“That part’s manageable.”

“I hate to ask this favour, but you know how things are. The current administation—well, the budget’s just not there, which means the agency’s all about finding efficiencies. In that context, a re-used asset’s a real cost-saver.”

“OK,” said Fitzsimmons. “I’ll recommend it.”

“Thanks,” said Spector.

For Donald Miller, committed life went on. Doctor Angeline never came back, and nothing ever came of the Fitzsimmons interview, so Miller assumed he’d flubbed it. The other patients appeared and disappeared, never making much of an impression. Miller suffered through bouts of anxiety, depression and sometimes difficulty telling truth from fiction. The doctors had cured him of his initial delusion that he was actually hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Europe, but doubts remained. He simply learned to keep them internal. Then life got better. Miller made a friend, a new patient named Wellesley. Wellesley was also from Cincinatti, and the two of them got on splendidly. Finally, Miller had someone to talk to—to *really* talk to. As far as Miller saw it, Wellesley’s only flaw was that he was too interested in politics, always going on about international affairs and domestic policy, and how he hated the communists and hated the current administration for not being hard enough on them, and on internal communists, “because those are the worst, Donny. The scheming little rats that live among us.”

Miller didn’t say much of anything about that kind of stuff at first, but when he realized it made Wellesley happy to be humoured, he humoured him. He started repeating Wellesley’s statements to himself at night, and as he repeated them he started believing them. He read books that Wellesley gave him, smuggled into the institution by an acquaintance, like contraband. “And what’s *that* tell you about this great republic of ours? Land of the free, yet we can’t read everything we want to read.” Miller had never been interested in policy before. Now he learned how he was governed, oppressed, undermined by the enemy within. “There’s even some of that ilk in this hospital,” Wellesley told him one evening. “Some of the doctors and staff—they’re pure reds. I’ve heard them talking in the lounge about unions and racial justice.”

“I thought only poor people were communists,” said Miller.

“That’s what they want you to believe, so that if you ever get real mad about it you’ll turn on your fellow man instead of the real enemy: the one in power. Ain’t that a real mad fucking world. Everything’s all messed up. Like take—” Wellesley went silent and shook his head. A nurse walked by. “—no, nevermind, man. I don’t want to get you mixed up in anything.”

“Tell me,” Miller implored him.

“Like, well, take—take the President. He says all the right things in public, but that’s only to get elected. If you look at what he’s actually doing, like the policies and the appointments and where he spends *our* money, you can see his true fucking colours.”

Later they talked about revolutions, the American, the French, the Russian, and how if things got too bad the only way out was violence. “But it’s not always like that. The violence doesn’t have to be total. It can be smart, targeted. You take out the right person at the right time and maybe you save a million lives.

“Don’t you agree?” asked Wellesley.

“I guess...”

“Come on—you can be more honest than that. It’s just the two of us here. Two dregs of society that no one gives a shit about.”

“I agree,” said Miller.

Wellesley slapped him on the shoulder. “You know what?”

“What?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

Three months later, much to his surprise, Donald Miller was released from the mental institution he’d spent the last few years in. He even got a little piece of paper that declared him sane. He tried writing Wellesley a few times from the outside, but he never got a response. When he got up the courage to show up at the institution, he was told by a nurse that she shouldn’t be telling him this *but that Wellesley had taken his own life soon after Miller was released.*

Alone again, Donald Miller tried integrating into society, but it was tough going. He couldn’t make friends, and he couldn’t hold down a job. He was a hard worker but always too weird. People didn’t like him, or found him off-putting or creepy, or sometimes they intentionally made his life so unbearable he had to leave, then they pretended they were sorry to see him go. No one ever said anything true or concrete, like, “You stink,” or “You don’t shave regularly enough,” or “Your cologne smells cheap.” It was always merely hinted at, suggested. He was different. He didn’t belong. He felt unwelcome everywhere. His only solace was books, because books never judged him. He realized he hated the world around him, and whenever the President was on television, he hated the President too.

One day, Donald Miller woke up and knew exactly what he needed to do.

After all, he was a bright guy.

It was three weeks before Christmas. The snow was coming down slowly in big white flakes. The mood was magical, and Spector was sitting at a table in an upscale New York City restaurant with his wife and kids, ordering French wine and *magret de canard,* which was just a fancy French term for duck breast. The lighting was low so you could see winter through the big windows. A jazz band was playing something by Duke Ellington. Then the restaurant’s phone rang. Someone picked up. “Yes?” Somebody *whispered.* “Now?” asked the person who’d picked up the call. A commotion began, spreading from the staff to the diners and back to the staff, until someone turned a television on in the kitchen, and someone else dropped a glass, and a woman screamed as the glass shattered and a man yelled, “Oh my God, he’s been shot! The President’s been shot.”

At those words everyone in the restaurant jumped—*everyone but Spector,* who calmly swallowed the duck he’d been chewing, picked up his glass of wine and made a silent toast to the future of the agency.

The dinner was, understandably, cut short, and everyone made their way out to their cars to drive home through the falling snow. In his car, Spector assured his family that everything would be fine. Then he listened without comment as his wife and daughter exchanged uninformed opinions about *who would do such a terrible thing* and *what if we’re under attack* and *maybe it’s the Soviet Union…*

As he pulled into the street on which their hotel was located, Spector noticed a black car with tinted windows idling across from the hotel entrance. 

Passing, he waved, *and the car merged into traffic and drove obediently away.*",2,1762569142.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

    single dad
    out of work
    2 kids
    please help

He was thirty-four years old.

He'd been homeless for almost two years.

He knocked on a driver's side window and the driver shook her head, not even making eye contact. The next lowered his window and told him to get a fucking job. Sometimes people asked where his kids were while he was out here. It was a fair question. Sometimes they spat at him. Sometimes they got really pissed because they had to work hard for their dime while he was out here begging for it. *A leech on society. A deadbeat. A liar. A fraud, a cheat, a swindler, a drain on the better elements of the world.* But usually they just ignored him. Once in a while they gave him some money, and that was what happened now as a woman distastefully held a ten-dollar bill out the window. “Thank you, ma'am,” said Miller, taking it. “Feed your children,” said the woman. Then the light changed from red to green and the woman drove off. Miller stepped off the street onto the paved shoulder, waited for the next red light, the next group of cars, and repeated.

“It's almost Fordian,” said Spector.

Nevis nodded, pouring coffee from a paper cup into his mouth. “Mhm.”

The pair of them were observing Miller through binoculars from behind the tinted windshield of their black spook car, parked an inconspicuous distance away. Spector continued: “It's like capitalism's chewed him up for so long he's applied capitalist praxis to panhandling. I mean, look: it’s a virtual assembly line, and there he dutifully goes, station to demeaning station, for an entire shift.”

“Yeah,” said Nevis.

The traffic lights changed a few times.

The radio played Janis Joplin.

“So,” said Nevis, holding an empty paper coffee cup, “you sure he's our guy?”

“I'm sure. No wife, no kids, no friends or relatives.”

“Ain't what his sign says.”

“Today.”

“Yeah, today.”

(Yesterday, Miller had been stranded in the city after getting mugged and needed money to get back to Pittsburgh, but that apparently didn't pull as hard on the heartstrings.)

“And you said he was in the army?”

“Sure was.”

“What stripe was he?”

“Didn't get past first, so I wouldn't count on his conditioning too much.”

“Didn't consider him suitable—or what?”

“Got tossed out before they could get the hooks into his head. Couldn't keep his opinions on point or to himself. Spoke his mind. *Independent thinker.*” Nevis grinned. “But there's more. Something I haven't told you. Here,” he said, tossing a fat file folder onto Spector’s lap.

Spector stuck a toothpick in his mouth and looked through the documents.

“Check his school records,” said Nevis.

Spector read them. “Good grades. No disciplinary problems. Straight through to high school graduation.”

“Check the district.”

Spector bit his toothpick so hard it cracked. He spat out the pieces. “This is almost too good. North Mayfield Public School Board, Cincinnati, Ohio—and, oh shit, class of 1952. That's where we test-ran *Idiom*, isn't it?”

“Uh huh,” said Nevis.

Spector picked up his binoculars and watched Miller beg for a few moments.

Nevis continued: “Simplants. False memories. LSD-laced fruit juice. Mass hypnosis. From what I've heard, it was a real fucking mental playground over there.”

“They shut it down in what, fifty-four?”

“Fifty-three. A lot of the guys who worked there went on to *Ultra* and *Monarch*. Some fell off the edge entirely, so you know what that means.”

“And a lot of the subjects ended up dead, or worse—didn't they?”

“Not our guy, though.”

“No.”

“Not yet anyway.” They both laughed, and they soon drove away.

It had started raining, and Donald Miller kept going up to car after car, holding his cardboard sign, now wet and starting to fall apart, collecting spare change from the spared kindness of strangers.

A few days later a black car pulled up to the same intersection. Donald Miller walked up to it and knocked on the driver's side window. Spector was behind the wheel. “Spare any money?” asked Donald Miller, showing his sign, which today said he had one child but that child had a form of cancer whose treatment Miller couldn't afford.

“No, but I can spare you a job,” said Spector.

“A job. *What?*” said Miller.

“Yes. I'm offering you work, Donald.”

“What kind of—hey, how-the-hell do you know my name, huh!”

“Relax, Donald. Get in.”

“No,” said Miller, backing slowly away, almost into another vehicle, whose driver **honked.** Donald jumped. “Don't you want to hear my offer?” asked Spector.

“I don't have the skills for no job, man. Do you think if I had the skills I'd be out here doing this shit?”

“You've already demonstrated the two basic requirements: standing and holding a sign. You're qualified. Now get in the car, please.”

“The *fuck* is this?”

Spector smiled. “Donald, Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office.”

“What, you're fucking crazy, man,” said Miller, his body tensing up, a change coming over his eyes and a self-disbelief over his face. “Who the fuck is—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald. Please get in the car.”

Miller opened his mouth, looked briefly toward the sky, then crossed to the other side of the car, opened the passenger side door, and sat politely beside Spector. When he was settled, Nevis—from the back seat—threw a thick hood over his head and stuck him with a syringe.

Donald Miller woke up naked next to a pile of drab dockworkers’ clothes and a bag of money. He was disoriented, afraid, and about to run when Spector grabbed his arm. “It's all right, Donald,” he said. “You don't need to be afraid. You're in Principal Lewis’ office now. He has a job for you to do. Just put on those clothes.”

“Put them on and do what?”

Miller was looking at the bag of money. He noted
other people here, including a man in a dark suit, and several people with cameras and film equipment. “Like I said before, all you have to do is hold a sign.”

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald. You accepted and willingly got in the car with me. You don't remember the ride because you feel asleep. You were very tired. We didn't want to wake you until you were rested.”

Miller breathed heavily. “Job doing what?”

“Holding a sign.”

“OK, and what's the sign say?”

“It doesn't say anything, Donald—completely blank—just as Principal Lewis likes it.”

“And the clothes, do I get to keep the clothes after we're done. Because you took my old clothes, you…”

“You’ll get new clothes,” said Spector.

“And Principal Lewis wants me to put on these clothes and hold the completely blank sign, and then I’ll get paid and get new clothes?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

So, for the next two weeks, Donald Miller put on various kinds of working clothes, held blank signs, sometimes walked, sometimes stood still, sometimes opened his mouth and sometimes closed it, sometimes sat, or lay down on the ground; or on the floor, because he did all these things in different locations, inside and outside: on an empty factory floor, in a muddy field, on a stretch of traffic-less road. And all the while they took photographs of him and filmed him, and he never knew what any of it meant, why he was doing it. They only spoke to give him directions: “Look angry,” “Pretend you’re starving,” “Look like someone’s about to push you in the back,” “like you’re jostling for position,” “like you’ve had enough and you just can’t fucking take it anymore and whatever you want you’re gonna have to fight for it!”

Then it was over.

Spector shook his hand, they bought him a couple of outfits, paid him his money and sent him on his way. “Sorry, we have to do it this way, but—”

Donald Miller found himself at night in a motel room rented under a name he didn’t recognise, with a printed note saying he could stay as long as he liked. He stayed two days before buying a bus ticket back to Cincinnati, where he was from. He lived well there for a while. The money wasn’t insignificant, and he spent it with restraint, but even the new clothes and money couldn’t wipe the stain of homelessness off him, and he couldn’t convince anyone to give him a job. Less than a year later he was back on the streets begging.

The whole episode—because that’s how he thought about it—was clouded by creamy surreality, which just thickened as time went by until it seemed like it had been a dream, as distant as his time in high school.

One day, several years later, Donald Miller was standing outside an electronics shop, the kind with all the new televisions set up in the display window by the street and turned so that all who passed by could see them and watch and marvel and need to have a set of his own. Miller was watching daytime programming on one of the sets when the broadcast *on all the sets,* which had been showing a few different stations—*cut suddenly to a news alert:*

A few people stopped to watch alongside.

“What’s going on?” a man asked.

“I don’t know,” said Miller.

*On the screens, a handsome news reporter was solemnly reading out a statement about anti-government protests happening in some communist country in eastern Europe. “...they marched again today, in the hundreds of thousands, shouting, ‘We want bread! We want freedom!’ and holding signs denouncing the current regime and imploring the West—and the United States specifically—for help.”* There was more, but Miller had stopped listening. There rose a ***thumping-coursing*** followed by a ***ringing*** in his ears. And his eyes were focused on *the faces of the protestors in the photos and clips the news reporter was speaking over:* because they were his face: **all of them were his face!**

“Hey!” Miller yelled.

The people gathered at the electronics store window looked over at him. “You all right there, buddy?” one asked.

“Don’t you see: it’s me.”

“What’s you?”

“There—” He pointed with a shaking finger at one of the television sets. “—me.”

“Which one, honey?” a woman asked, chuckling.

Miller grabbed her by the shoulders, startling her, saying: “All of them. All of them are me.” And, looking back at the set, he started hitting the display window with his hand. “That one and that one, and that one. That one, that one, that one…”

He grew hysterical, violent; but the people on the street worked together to subdue him, and the owner of the electronics store called the police. The police picked him up, asked him a few questions and drove him to a mental institution. They suggested he stay here, “just for a few days, until you’re better,” and when he insisted he didn’t want to stay there, they changed their suggestion to a command backed by the law and threatened him with charges: assault, resisting arrest, loitering, vagrancy.

Donald Miller was in the institution when the President came on the television and in a serious address to the nation declared that the United States of America, a God fearing and freedom loving people, could no longer stand idly by while another people, equally deserving of freedom, yearning for it, was systematically oppressed. Those people, the President said, would now be saved and welcomed into the arms of the West. After that, the President declared war on the country in which Donald Miller had seen himself protesting against the government.

Once the shock of it passed, being committed wasn’t so bad. It was warm, there was free food and free television, and most of the nurses were nice enough. Sure, there were crazies in there, people who’d bang their heads against the wall or speak in made-up languages, but not everyone was like that, and it was easy to avoid the ones who were. The doctors were the worst part: not because they were cruel but because they were cold, and all they ever did was ask questions and make notes and never tell you what the notes were about. Eventually he even confided in one doctor, a young woman named Angeline, and told her the truth about what had happened to him. He talked to Angeline more often after that, which was fine with him. Then, unexpectedly, Angelina was gone and a man with a buzzcut came to talk to him. “Who are you?” Miller asked. “My name’s Fitzsimmons.” “Are you a doctor?” “No, I’m not a doctor. I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as he *really* loses it.”

“That part’s manageable.”

“I hate to ask this favour, but you know how things are. The current administation—well, the budget’s just not there, which means the agency’s all about finding efficiencies. In that context, a re-used asset’s a real cost-saver.”

A fraud, a cheat, a swindler, a drain on the better elements of the world.* But usually they just ignored him. Once in a while they gave him some money, and that was what happened now as a woman distastefully held a ten-dollar bill out the window. “Thank you, ma'am,” said Miller, taking it. “Feed your children,” said the woman. Then the light changed from red to green and the woman drove off. Miller stepped off the street onto the paved shoulder, waited for the next red light, the next group of cars, and repeated.

“It's almost Fordian,” said Spector.

Nevis nodded, pouring coffee from a paper cup into his mouth. “Mhm.”

The pair of them were observing Miller through binoculars from behind the tinted windshield of their black spook car, parked an inconspicuous distance away. Spector continued: “It's like capitalism's chewed him up for so long he's applied capitalist praxis to panhandling. I mean, look: it’s a virtual assembly line, and there he dutifully goes, station to demeaning station, for an entire shift.”

“Yeah,” said Nevis.

The traffic lights changed a few times.

The radio played Janis Joplin.

“So,” said Nevis, holding an empty paper coffee cup, “you sure he's our guy?”

“I'm sure. No wife, no kids, no friends or relatives.”

“Ain't what his sign says.”

“Today.”

“Yeah, today.”

(Yesterday, Miller had been stranded in the city after getting mugged and needed money to get back to Pittsburgh, but that apparently didn't pull as hard on the heartstrings.)

“And you said he was in the army?”

“Sure was.”

“What stripe was he?”

“Didn't get past first, so I wouldn't count on his conditioning too much.”

“Didn't consider him suitable—or what?”

“Got tossed out before they could get the hooks into his head. Couldn't keep his opinions on point or to himself. Spoke his mind. *Independent thinker.*” Nevis grinned. “But there's more. Something I haven't told you. Here,” he said, tossing a fat file folder onto Spector’s lap.

Spector stuck a toothpick in his mouth and looked through the documents.

“Check his school records,” said Nevis.

Spector read them. “Good grades. No disciplinary problems. Straight through to high school graduation.”

“Check the district.”

Spector bit his toothpick so hard it cracked. He spat out the pieces. “This is almost too good. North Mayfield Public School Board, Cincinnati, Ohio—and, oh shit, class of 1952. That's where we test-ran *Idiom*, isn't it?”

“Uh huh,” said Nevis.

Spector picked up his binoculars and watched Miller beg for a few moments.

Nevis continued: “Simplants. False memories. LSD-laced fruit juice. Mass hypnosis. From what I've heard, it was a real fucking mental playground over there.”

“They shut it down in what, fifty-four?”

“Fifty-three. A lot of the guys who worked there went on to *Ultra* and *Monarch*. Some fell off the edge entirely, so you know what that means.”

“And a lot of the subjects ended up dead, or worse—didn't they?”

“Not our guy, though.”

“No.”

“Not yet anyway.” They both laughed, and they soon drove away.

It had started raining, and Donald Miller kept going up to car after car, holding his cardboard sign, now wet and starting to fall apart, collecting spare change from the spared kindness of strangers.

A few days later a black car pulled up to the same intersection. Donald Miller walked up to it and knocked on the driver's side window. Spector was behind the wheel. “Spare any money?” asked Donald Miller, showing his sign, which today said he had one child but that child had a form of cancer whose treatment Miller couldn't afford.

“No, but I can spare you a job,” said Spector.

“A job. *What?*” said Miller.

“Yes. I'm offering you work, Donald.”

“What kind of—hey, how-the-hell do you know my name, huh!”

“Relax, Donald. Get in.”

“No,” said Miller, backing slowly away, almost into another vehicle, whose driver **honked.** Donald jumped. “Don't you want to hear my offer?” asked Spector.

“I don't have the skills for no job, man. Do you think if I had the skills I'd be out here doing this shit?”

“You've already demonstrated the two basic requirements: standing and holding a sign. You're qualified. Now get in the car, please.”

“The *fuck* is this?”

Spector smiled. “Donald, Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office.”

“What, you're fucking crazy, man,” said Miller, his body tensing up, a change coming over his eyes and a self-disbelief over his face. “Who the fuck is—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald. Please get in the car.”

Miller opened his mouth, looked briefly toward the sky, then crossed to the other side of the car, opened the passenger side door, and sat politely beside Spector. When he was settled, Nevis—from the back seat—threw a thick hood over his head and stuck him with a syringe.

Donald Miller woke up naked next to a pile of drab dockworkers’ clothes and a bag of money. He was disoriented, afraid, and about to run when Spector grabbed his arm. “It's all right, Donald,” he said. “You don't need to be afraid. You're in Principal Lewis’ office now. He has a job for you to do. Just put on those clothes.”

“Put them on and do what?”

Miller was looking at the bag of money. He noted
other people here, including a man in a dark suit, and several people with cameras and film equipment. “Like I said before, all you have to do is hold a sign.”

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald. You accepted and willingly got in the car with me. You don't remember the ride because you feel asleep. You were very tired. We didn't want to wake you until you were rested.”

Miller breathed heavily. “Job doing what?”

“Holding a sign.”

“OK, and what's the sign say?”

“It doesn't say anything, Donald—completely blank—just as Principal Lewis likes it.”

“And the clothes, do I get to keep the clothes after we're done. Because you took my old clothes, you…”

“You’ll get new clothes,” said Spector.

“And Principal Lewis wants me to put on these clothes and hold the completely blank sign, and then I’ll get paid and get new clothes?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

So, for the next two weeks, Donald Miller put on various kinds of working clothes, held blank signs, sometimes walked, sometimes stood still, sometimes opened his mouth and sometimes closed it, sometimes sat, or lay down on the ground; or on the floor, because he did all these things in different locations, inside and outside: on an empty factory floor, in a muddy field, on a stretch of traffic-less road. And all the while they took photographs of him and filmed him, and he never knew what any of it meant, why he was doing it. They only spoke to give him directions: “Look angry,” “Pretend you’re starving,” “Look like someone’s about to push you in the back,” “like you’re jostling for position,” “like you’ve had enough and you just can’t fucking take it anymore and whatever you want you’re gonna have to fight for it!”

Then it was over.

Spector shook his hand, they bought him a couple of outfits, paid him his money and sent him on his way. “Sorry, we have to do it this way, but—”

Donald Miller found himself at night in a motel room rented under a name he didn’t recognise, with a printed note saying he could stay as long as he liked. He stayed two days before buying a bus ticket back to Cincinnati, where he was from. He lived well there for a while. The money wasn’t insignificant, and he spent it with restraint, but even the new clothes and money couldn’t wipe the stain of homelessness off him, and he couldn’t convince anyone to give him a job. Less than a year later he was back on the streets begging.

The whole episode—because that’s how he thought about it—was clouded by creamy surreality, which just thickened as time went by until it seemed like it had been a dream, as distant as his time in high school.

One day, several years later, Donald Miller was standing outside an electronics shop, the kind with all the new televisions set up in the display window by the street and turned so that all who passed by could see them and watch and marvel and need to have a set of his own. Miller was watching daytime programming on one of the sets when the broadcast *on all the sets,* which had been showing a few different stations—*cut suddenly to a news alert:*

A few people stopped to watch alongside.

“What’s going on?” a man asked.

“I don’t know,” said Miller.

*On the screens, a handsome news reporter was solemnly reading out a statement about anti-government protests happening in some communist country in eastern Europe. “...they marched again today, in the hundreds of thousands, shouting, ‘We want bread! We want freedom!’ and holding signs denouncing the current regime and imploring the West—and the United States specifically—for help.”* There was more, but Miller had stopped listening. There rose a ***thumping-coursing*** followed by a ***ringing*** in his ears. And his eyes were focused on *the faces of the protestors in the photos and clips the news reporter was speaking over:* because they were his face: **all of them were his face!**

“Hey!” Miller yelled.

The people gathered at the electronics store window looked over at him. “You all right there, buddy?” one asked.

“Don’t you see: it’s me.”

“What’s you?”

“There—” He pointed with a shaking finger at one of the television sets. “—me.”

“Which one, honey?” a woman asked, chuckling.

Miller grabbed her by the shoulders, startling her, saying: “All of them. All of them are me.” And, looking back at the set, he started hitting the display window with his hand. “That one and that one, and that one. That one, that one, that one…”

He grew hysterical, violent; but the people on the street worked together to subdue him, and the owner of the electronics store called the police. The police picked him up, asked him a few questions and drove him to a mental institution. They suggested he stay here, “just for a few days, until you’re better,” and when he insisted he didn’t want to stay there, they changed their suggestion to a command backed by the law and threatened him with charges: assault, resisting arrest, loitering, vagrancy.

Donald Miller was in the institution when the President came on the television and in a serious address to the nation declared that the United States of America, a God fearing and freedom loving people, could no longer stand idly by while another people, equally deserving of freedom, yearning for it, was systematically oppressed. Those people, the President said, would now be saved and welcomed into the arms of the West. After that, the President declared war on the country in which Donald Miller had seen himself protesting against the government.

Once the shock of it passed, being committed wasn’t so bad. It was warm, there was free food and free television, and most of the nurses were nice enough. Sure, there were crazies in there, people who’d bang their heads against the wall or speak in made-up languages, but not everyone was like that, and it was easy to avoid the ones who were. The doctors were the worst part: not because they were cruel but because they were cold, and all they ever did was ask questions and make notes and never tell you what the notes were about. Eventually he even confided in one doctor, a young woman named Angeline, and told her the truth about what had happened to him. He talked to Angeline more often after that, which was fine with him. Then, unexpectedly, Angelina was gone and a man with a buzzcut came to talk to him. “Who are you?” Miller asked. “My name’s Fitzsimmons.” “Are you a doctor?” “No, I’m not a doctor. I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as he *really* loses it.”

“That part’s manageable.”

“I hate to ask this favour, but you know how things are. The current administation—well, the budget’s just not there, which means the agency’s all about finding efficiencies. In that context, a re-used asset’s a real cost-saver.”

“OK,” said Fitzsimmons. “I’ll recommend it.”

“Thanks,” said Spector.

For Donald Miller, committed life went on. Doctor Angeline never came back, and nothing ever came of the Fitzsimmons interview, so Miller assumed he’d flubbed it. The other patients appeared and disappeared, never making much of an impression. Miller suffered through bouts of anxiety, depression and sometimes difficulty telling truth from fiction. The doctors had cured him of his initial delusion that he was actually hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Europe, but doubts remained. He simply learned to keep them internal. Then life got better. Miller made a friend, a new patient named Wellesley. Wellesley was also from Cincinatti, and the two of them got on splendidly. Finally, Miller had someone to talk to—to *really* talk to. As far as Miller saw it, Wellesley’s only flaw was that he was too interested in politics, always going on about international affairs and domestic policy, and how he hated the communists and hated the current administration for not being hard enough on them, and on internal communists, “because those are the worst, Donny. The scheming little rats that live among us.”

Miller didn’t say much of anything about that kind of stuff at first, but when he realized it made Wellesley happy to be humoured, he humoured him. He started repeating Wellesley’s statements to himself at night, and as he repeated them he started believing them. He read books that Wellesley gave him, smuggled into the institution by an acquaintance, like contraband. “And what’s *that* tell you about this great republic of ours? Land of the free, yet we can’t read everything we want to read.” Miller had never been interested in policy before. Now he learned how he was governed, oppressed, undermined by the enemy within. “There’s even some of that ilk in this hospital,” Wellesley told him one evening. “Some of the doctors and staff—they’re pure reds. I’ve heard them talking in the lounge about unions and racial justice.”

“I thought only poor people were communists,” said Miller.

“That’s what they want you to believe, so that if you ever get real mad about it you’ll turn on your fellow man instead of the real enemy: the one in power. Ain’t that a real mad fucking world. Everything’s all messed up. Like take—” Wellesley went silent and shook his head. A nurse walked by. “—no, nevermind, man. I don’t want to get you mixed up in anything.”

“Tell me,” Miller implored him.

“Like, well, take—take the President. He says all the right things in public, but that’s only to get elected. If you look at what he’s actually doing, like the policies and the appointments and where he spends *our* money, you can see his true fucking colours.”

Later they talked about revolutions, the American, the French, the Russian, and how if things got too bad the only way out was violence. “But it’s not always like that. The violence doesn’t have to be total. It can be smart, targeted. You take out the right person at the right time and maybe you save a million lives.

“Don’t you agree?” asked Wellesley.

“I guess...”

“Come on—you can be more honest than that. It’s just the two of us here. Two dregs of society that no one gives a shit about.”

“I agree,” said Miller.

Wellesley slapped him on the shoulder. “You know what?”

“What?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

Three months later, much to his surprise, Donald Miller was released from the mental institution he’d spent the last few years in. He even got a little piece of paper that declared him sane. He tried writing Wellesley a few times from the outside, but he never got a response. When he got up the courage to show up at the institution, he was told by a nurse that she shouldn’t be telling him this *but that Wellesley had taken his own life soon after Miller was released.*

Alone again, Donald Miller tried integrating into society, but it was tough going. He couldn’t make friends, and he couldn’t hold down a job. He was a hard worker but always too weird. People didn’t like him, or found him off-putting or creepy, or sometimes they intentionally made his life so unbearable he had to leave, then they pretended they were sorry to see him go. No one ever said anything true or concrete, like, “You stink,” or “You don’t shave regularly enough,” or “Your cologne smells cheap.” It was always merely hinted at, suggested. He was different. He didn’t belong. He felt unwelcome everywhere. His only solace was books, because books never judged him. He realized he hated the world around him, and whenever the President was on television, he hated the President too.

One day, Donald Miller woke up and knew exactly what he needed to do.

After all, he was a bright guy.

It was three weeks before Christmas. The snow was coming down slowly in big white flakes. The mood was magical, and Spector was sitting at a table in an upscale New York City restaurant with his wife and kids, ordering French wine and *magret de canard,* which was just a fancy French term for duck breast. The lighting was low so you could see winter through the big windows. A jazz band was playing something by Duke Ellington. Then the restaurant’s phone rang. Someone picked up. “Yes?” Somebody *whispered.* “Now?” asked the person who’d picked up the call. A commotion began, spreading from the staff to the diners and back to the staff, until someone turned a television on in the kitchen, and someone else dropped a glass, and a woman screamed as the glass shattered and a man yelled, “Oh my God, he’s been shot! The President’s been shot.”

At those words everyone in the restaurant jumped—*everyone but Spector,* who calmly swallowed the duck he’d been chewing, picked up his glass of wine and made a silent toast to the future of the agency.

The dinner was, understandably, cut short, and everyone made their way out to their cars to drive home through the falling snow. In his car, Spector assured his family that everything would be fine. Then he listened without comment as his wife and daughter exchanged uninformed opinions about *who would do such a terrible thing* and *what if we’re under attack* and *maybe it’s the Soviet Union…*

As he pulled into the street on which their hotel was located, Spector noticed a black car with tinted windows idling across from the hotel entrance. 

Passing, he waved, *and the car merged into traffic and drove obediently away.*",3,1762569067.0,libraryofshadows,1,1.0,False

    single dad
    out of work
    2 kids
    please help

He was thirty-four years old.

He'd been homeless for almost two years.

He knocked on a driver's side window and the driver shook her head, not even making eye contact. The next lowered his window and told him to get a fucking job. Sometimes people asked where his kids were while he was out here. It was a fair question. Sometimes they spat at him.

One day, several years later, Donald Miller was standing outside an electronics shop, the kind with all the new televisions set up in the display window by the street and turned so that all who passed by could see them and watch and marvel and need to have a set of his own. Miller was watching daytime programming on one of the sets when the broadcast *on all the sets,* which had been showing a few different stations—*cut suddenly to a news alert:*

A few people stopped to watch alongside.

“What’s going on?” a man asked.

“I don’t know,” said Miller.

*On the screens, a handsome news reporter was solemnly reading out a statement about anti-government protests happening in some communist country in eastern Europe. “...they marched again today, in the hundreds of thousands, shouting, ‘We want bread! We want freedom!’ and holding signs denouncing the current regime and imploring the West—and the United States specifically—for help.”* There was more, but Miller had stopped listening. There rose a ***thumping-coursing*** followed by a ***ringing*** in his ears. And his eyes were focused on *the faces of the protestors in the photos and clips the news reporter was speaking over:* because they were his face: **all of them were his face!**

“Hey!” Miller yelled.

The people gathered at the electronics store window looked over at him. “You all right there, buddy?” one asked.

“Don’t you see: it’s me.”

“What’s you?”

“There—” He pointed with a shaking finger at one of the television sets. “—me.”

“Which one, honey?” a woman asked, chuckling.

Miller grabbed her by the shoulders, startling her, saying: “All of them. All of them are me.” And, looking back at the set, he started hitting the display window with his hand. “That one and that one, and that one. That one, that one, that one…”

He grew hysterical, violent; but the people on the street worked together to subdue him, and the owner of the electronics store called the police. The police picked him up, asked him a few questions and drove him to a mental institution. They suggested he stay here, “just for a few days, until you’re better,” and when he insisted he didn’t want to stay there, they changed their suggestion to a command backed by the law and threatened him with charges: assault, resisting arrest, loitering, vagrancy.

Donald Miller was in the institution when the President came on the television and in a serious address to the nation declared that the United States of America, a God fearing and freedom loving people, could no longer stand idly by while another people, equally deserving of freedom, yearning for it, was systematically oppressed. Those people, the President said, would now be saved and welcomed into the arms of the West. After that, the President declared war on the country in which Donald Miller had seen himself protesting against the government.

Once the shock of it passed, being committed wasn’t so bad. It was warm, there was free food and free television, and most of the nurses were nice enough. Sure, there were crazies in there, people who’d bang their heads against the wall or speak in made-up languages, but not everyone was like that, and it was easy to avoid the ones who were. The doctors were the worst part: not because they were cruel but because they were cold, and all they ever did was ask questions and make notes and never tell you what the notes were about. Eventually he even confided in one doctor, a young woman named Angeline, and told her the truth about what had happened to him. He talked to Angeline more often after that, which was fine with him. Then, unexpectedly, Angelina was gone and a man with a buzzcut came to talk to him. “Who are you?” Miller asked. “My name’s Fitzsimmons.” “Are you a doctor?” “No, I’m not a doctor. I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as he *really* loses it.”

“That part’s manageable.”

“I hate to ask this favour, but you know how things are. The current administation—well, the budget’s just not there, which means the agency’s all about finding efficiencies. In that context, a re-used asset’s a real cost-saver.”

“OK,” said Fitzsimmons. “I’ll recommend it.”

“Thanks,” said Spector.

For Donald Miller, committed life went on. Doctor Angeline never came back, and nothing ever came of the Fitzsimmons interview, so Miller assumed he’d flubbed it. The other patients appeared and disappeared, never making much of an impression. Miller suffered through bouts of anxiety, depression and sometimes difficulty telling truth from fiction. The doctors had cured him of his initial delusion that he was actually hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Europe, but doubts remained. He simply learned to keep them internal. Then life got better. Miller made a friend, a new patient named Wellesley. Wellesley was also from Cincinatti, and the two of them got on splendidly. Finally, Miller had someone to talk to—to *really* talk to. As far as Miller saw it, Wellesley’s only flaw was that he was too interested in politics, always going on about international affairs and domestic policy, and how he hated the communists and hated the current administration for not being hard enough on them, and on internal communists, “because those are the worst, Donny. The scheming little rats that live among us.”

Miller didn’t say much of anything about that kind of stuff at first, but when he realized it made Wellesley happy to be humoured, he humoured him. He started repeating Wellesley’s statements to himself at night, and as he repeated them he started believing them. He read books that Wellesley gave him, smuggled into the institution by an acquaintance, like contraband. “And what’s *that* tell you about this great republic of ours? Land of the free, yet we can’t read everything we want to read.” Miller had never been interested in policy before. Now he learned how he was governed, oppressed, undermined by the enemy within. “There’s even some of that ilk in this hospital,” Wellesley told him one evening. “Some of the doctors and staff—they’re pure reds. I’ve heard them talking in the lounge about unions and racial justice.”

“I thought only poor people were communists,” said Miller.

“That’s what they want you to believe, so that if you ever get real mad about it you’ll turn on your fellow man instead of the real enemy: the one in power. Ain’t that a real mad fucking world. Everything’s all messed up. Like take—” Wellesley went silent and shook his head. A nurse walked by. “—no, nevermind, man. I don’t want to get you mixed up in anything.”

“Tell me,” Miller implored him.

“Like, well, take—take the President. He says all the right things in public, but that’s only to get elected. If you look at what he’s actually doing, like the policies and the appointments and where he spends *our* money, you can see his true fucking colours.”

Later they talked about revolutions, the American, the French, the Russian, and how if things got too bad the only way out was violence. “But it’s not always like that. The violence doesn’t have to be total. It can be smart, targeted. You take out the right person at the right time and maybe you save a million lives.

“Don’t you agree?” asked Wellesley.

“I guess...”

“Come on—you can be more honest than that. It’s just the two of us here. Two dregs of society that no one gives a shit about.”

“I agree,” said Miller.

Wellesley slapped him on the shoulder. “You know what?”

“What?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

Three months later, much to his surprise, Donald Miller was released from the mental institution he’d spent the last few years in. He even got a little piece of paper that declared him sane. He tried writing Wellesley a few times from the outside, but he never got a response. When he got up the courage to show up at the institution, he was told by a nurse that she shouldn’t be telling him this *but that Wellesley had taken his own life soon after Miller was released.*

Alone again, Donald Miller tried integrating into society, but it was tough going. He couldn’t make friends, and he couldn’t hold down a job. He was a hard worker but always too weird. People didn’t like him, or found him off-putting or creepy, or sometimes they intentionally made his life so unbearable he had to leave, then they pretended they were sorry to see him go. No one ever said anything true or concrete, like, “You stink,” or “You don’t shave regularly enough,” or “Your cologne smells cheap.” It was always merely hinted at, suggested. He was different. He didn’t belong. He felt unwelcome everywhere. His only solace was books, because books never judged him. He realized he hated the world around him, and whenever the President was on television, he hated the President too.

One day, Donald Miller woke up and knew exactly what he needed to do.

After all, he was a bright guy.

It was three weeks before Christmas. The snow was coming down slowly in big white flakes. The mood was magical, and Spector was sitting at a table in an upscale New York City restaurant with his wife and kids, ordering French wine and *magret de canard,* which was just a fancy French term for duck breast. The lighting was low so you could see winter through the big windows. A jazz band was playing something by Duke Ellington. Then the restaurant’s phone rang. Someone picked up. “Yes?” Somebody *whispered.* “Now?” asked the person who’d picked up the call. A commotion began, spreading from the staff to the diners and back to the staff, until someone turned a television on in the kitchen, and someone else dropped a glass, and a woman screamed as the glass shattered and a man yelled, “Oh my God, he’s been shot! The President’s been shot.”

At those words everyone in the restaurant jumped—*everyone but Spector,* who calmly swallowed the duck he’d been chewing, picked up his glass of wine and made a silent toast to the future of the agency.

The dinner was, understandably, cut short, and everyone made their way out to their cars to drive home through the falling snow. In his car, Spector assured his family that everything would be fine. Then he listened without comment as his wife and daughter exchanged uninformed opinions about *who would do such a terrible thing* and *what if we’re under attack* and *maybe it’s the Soviet Union…*

As he pulled into the street on which their hotel was located, Spector noticed a black car with tinted windows idling across from the hotel entrance. 

Passing, he waved, *and the car merged into traffic and drove obediently away.*",2,1762569050.0,TheCrypticCompendium,1,0.76,False
1ords76,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1ords76/spooks/,Spooks,"It was a busy intersection and the weather was bad, but Donald Miller was out there, knocking on car windows while holding a sign that said:

    single dad
    out of work
    2 kids
    please help

He was thirty-four years old.

He'd been homeless for almost two years.

He knocked on a driver's side window and the driver shook her head, not even making eye contact. The next lowered his window and told him to get a fucking job. Sometimes people asked where his kids were while he was out here. It was a fair question. Sometimes they spat at him. Sometimes they got really pissed because they had to work hard for their dime while he was out here begging for it. *A leech on society. A deadbeat. A liar. A fraud, a cheat, a swindler, a drain on the better elements of the world.* But usually they just ignored him. Once in a while they gave him some money, and that was what happened now as a woman distastefully held a ten-dollar bill out the window. “Thank you, ma'am,” said Miller, taking it. “Feed your children,” said the woman. Then the light changed from red to green and the woman drove off. Miller stepped off the street onto the paved shoulder, waited for the next red light, the next group of cars, and repeated.

“It's almost Fordian,” said Spector.

Nevis nodded, pouring coffee from a paper cup into his mouth. “Mhm.”

The pair of them were observing Miller through binoculars from behind the tinted windshield of their black spook car, parked an inconspicuous distance away. Spector continued: “It's like capitalism's chewed him up for so long he's applied capitalist praxis to panhandling. I mean, look: it’s a virtual assembly line, and there he dutifully goes, station to demeaning station, for an entire shift.”

“Yeah,” said Nevis.

The traffic lights changed a few times.

The radio played Janis Joplin.

“So,” said Nevis, holding an empty paper coffee cup, “you sure he's our guy?”

“I'm sure. No wife, no kids, no friends or relatives.”

“Ain't what his sign says.”

“Today.”

“Yeah, today.”

(Yesterday, Miller had been stranded in the city after getting mugged and needed money to get back to Pittsburgh, but that apparently didn't pull as hard on the heartstrings.)

“And you said he was in the army?”

“Sure was.”

“What stripe was he?”

“Didn't get past first, so I wouldn't count on his conditioning too much.”

“Didn't consider him suitable—or what?”

“Got tossed out before they could get the hooks into his head. Couldn't keep his opinions on point or to himself. Spoke his mind. *Independent thinker.*” Nevis grinned. “But there's more. Something I haven't told you. Here,” he said, tossing a fat file folder onto Spector’s lap.

Spector stuck a toothpick in his mouth and looked through the documents.

“Check his school records,” said Nevis.

Spector read them. “Good grades. No disciplinary problems. Straight through to high school graduation.”

“Check the district.”

Spector bit his toothpick so hard it cracked. He spat out the pieces. “This is almost too good. North Mayfield Public School Board, Cincinnati, Ohio—and, oh shit, class of 1952. That's where we test-ran *Idiom*, isn't it?”

“Uh huh,” said Nevis.

Spector picked up his binoculars and watched Miller beg for a few moments.

Nevis continued: “Simplants. False memories. LSD-laced fruit juice. Mass hypnosis. From what I've heard, it was a real fucking mental playground over there.”

“They shut it down in what, fifty-four?”

“Fifty-three. A lot of the guys who worked there went on to *Ultra* and *Monarch*. Some fell off the edge entirely, so you know what that means.”

“And a lot of the subjects ended up dead, or worse—didn't they?”

“Not our guy, though.”

“No.”

“Not yet anyway.” They both laughed, and they soon drove away.

It had started raining, and Donald Miller kept going up to car after car, holding his cardboard sign, now wet and starting to fall apart, collecting spare change from the spared kindness of strangers.

A few days later a black car pulled up to the same intersection. Donald Miller walked up to it and knocked on the driver's side window. Spector was behind the wheel. “Spare any money?” asked Donald Miller, showing his sign, which today said he had one child but that child had a form of cancer whose treatment Miller couldn't afford.

“No, but I can spare you a job,” said Spector.

“A job. *What?*” said Miller.

“Yes. I'm offering you work, Donald.”

“What kind of—hey, how-the-hell do you know my name, huh!”

“Relax, Donald. Get in.”

“No,” said Miller, backing slowly away, almost into another vehicle, whose driver **honked.** Donald jumped. “Don't you want to hear my offer?” asked Spector.

“I don't have the skills for no job, man. Do you think if I had the skills I'd be out here doing this shit?”

“You've already demonstrated the two basic requirements: standing and holding a sign. You're qualified. Now get in the car, please.”

“The *fuck* is this?”

Spector smiled. “Donald, Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office.”

“What, you're fucking crazy, man,” said Miller, his body tensing up, a change coming over his eyes and a self-disbelief over his face. “Who the fuck is—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald. Please get in the car.”

Miller opened his mouth, looked briefly toward the sky, then crossed to the other side of the car, opened the passenger side door, and sat politely beside Spector. When he was settled, Nevis—from the back seat—threw a thick hood over his head and stuck him with a syringe.

Donald Miller woke up naked next to a pile of drab dockworkers’ clothes and a bag of money. He was disoriented, afraid, and about to run when Spector grabbed his arm. “It's all right, Donald,” he said. “You don't need to be afraid. You're in Principal Lewis’ office now. He has a job for you to do. Just put on those clothes.”

“Put them on and do what?”

Miller was looking at the bag of money. He noted
other people here, including a man in a dark suit, and several people with cameras and film equipment. “Like I said before, all you have to do is hold a sign.”

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald. You accepted and willingly got in the car with me. You don't remember the ride because you feel asleep. You were very tired. We didn't want to wake you until you were rested.”

Miller breathed heavily. “Job doing what?”

“Holding a sign.”

“OK, and what's the sign say?”

“It doesn't say anything, Donald—completely blank—just as Principal Lewis likes it.”

“And the clothes, do I get to keep the clothes after we're done. Because you took my old clothes, you…”

“You’ll get new clothes,” said Spector.

“And Principal Lewis wants me to put on these clothes and hold the completely blank sign, and then I’ll get paid and get new clothes?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

So, for the next two weeks, Donald Miller put on various kinds of working clothes, held blank signs, sometimes walked, sometimes stood still, sometimes opened his mouth and sometimes closed it, sometimes sat, or lay down on the ground; or on the floor, because he did all these things in different locations, inside and outside: on an empty factory floor, in a muddy field, on a stretch of traffic-less road. And all the while they took photographs of him and filmed him, and he never knew what any of it meant, why he was doing it. They only spoke to give him directions: “Look angry,” “Pretend you’re starving,” “Look like someone’s about to push you in the back,” “like you’re jostling for position,” “like you’ve had enough and you just can’t fucking take it anymore and whatever you want you’re gonna have to fight for it!”

Then it was over.

Spector shook his hand, they bought him a couple of outfits, paid him his money and sent him on his way. “Sorry, we have to do it this way, but—”

Donald Miller found himself at night in a motel room rented under a name he didn’t recognise, with a printed note saying he could stay as long as he liked. He stayed two days before buying a bus ticket back to Cincinnati, where he was from. He lived well there for a while. The money wasn’t insignificant, and he spent it with restraint, but even the new clothes and money couldn’t wipe the stain of homelessness off him, and he couldn’t convince anyone to give him a job. Less than a year later he was back on the streets begging.

The whole episode—because that’s how he thought about it—was clouded by creamy surreality, which just thickened as time went by until it seemed like it had been a dream, as distant as his time in high school.

He realized he hated the world around him, and whenever the President was on television, he hated the President too.

One day, Donald Miller woke up and knew exactly what he needed to do.

After all, he was a bright guy.

It was three weeks before Christmas. The snow was coming down slowly in big white flakes. The mood was magical, and Spector was sitting at a table in an upscale New York City restaurant with his wife and kids, ordering French wine and *magret de canard,* which was just a fancy French term for duck breast. The lighting was low so you could see winter through the big windows. A jazz band was playing something by Duke Ellington. Then the restaurant’s phone rang. Someone picked up. “Yes?” Somebody *whispered.* “Now?” asked the person who’d picked up the call. A commotion began, spreading from the staff to the diners and back to the staff, until someone turned a television on in the kitchen, and someone else dropped a glass, and a woman screamed as the glass shattered and a man yelled, “Oh my God, he’s been shot! The President’s been shot.”

At those words everyone in the restaurant jumped—*everyone but Spector,* who calmly swallowed the duck he’d been chewing, picked up his glass of wine and made a silent toast to the future of the agency.

The dinner was, understandably, cut short, and everyone made their way out to their cars to drive home through the falling snow. In his car, Spector assured his family that everything would be fine. Then he listened without comment as his wife and daughter exchanged uninformed opinions about *who would do such a terrible thing* and *what if we’re under attack* and *maybe it’s the Soviet Union…*

As he pulled into the street on which their hotel was located, Spector noticed a black car with tinted windows idling across from the hotel entrance. 

Passing, he waved, *and the car merged into traffic and drove obediently away.*",2,1762569035.0,DarkTales,1,1.0,False

1ordrzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1ordrzc/spooks/,Spooks,"It was a busy intersection and the weather was bad, but Donald Miller was out there, knocking on car windows while holding a sign that said:

    single dad
    out of work
    2 kids
    please help

He was thirty-four years old.

He'd been homeless for almost two years.

He knocked on a driver's side window and the driver shook her head, not even making eye contact. The next lowered his window and told him to get a fucking job. Sometimes people asked where his kids were while he was out here. It was a fair question. Sometimes they spat at him. Sometimes they got really pissed because they had to work hard for their dime while he was out here begging for it. *A leech on society. A deadbeat. A liar. A fraud, a cheat, a swindler, a drain on the better elements of the world.* But usually they just ignored him. Once in a while they gave him some money, and that was what happened now as a woman distastefully held a ten-dollar bill out the window. “Thank you, ma'am,” said Miller, taking it. “Feed your children,” said the woman. Then the light changed from red to green and the woman drove off. Miller stepped off the street onto the paved shoulder, waited for the next red light, the next group of cars, and repeated.

“It's almost Fordian,” said Spector.

Nevis nodded, pouring coffee from a paper cup into his mouth. “Mhm.”

The pair of them were observing Miller through binoculars from behind the tinted windshield of their black spook car, parked an inconspicuous distance away. Spector continued: “It's like capitalism's chewed him up for so long he's applied capitalist praxis to panhandling. I mean, look: it’s a virtual assembly line, and there he dutifully goes, station to demeaning station, for an entire shift.”

“Yeah,” said Nevis.

The traffic lights changed a few times.

The radio played Janis Joplin.

“So,” said Nevis, holding an empty paper coffee cup, “you sure he's our guy?”

“I'm sure. No wife, no kids, no friends or relatives.”

“Ain't what his sign says.”

“Today.”

“Yeah, today.”

(Yesterday, Miller had been stranded in the city after getting mugged and needed money to get back to Pittsburgh, but that apparently didn't pull as hard on the heartstrings.)

“And you said he was in the army?”

“Sure was.”

“What stripe was he?”

“Didn't get past first, so I wouldn't count on his conditioning too much.”

“Didn't consider him suitable—or what?”

“Got tossed out before they could get the hooks into his head. Couldn't keep his opinions on point or to himself. Spoke his mind. *Independent thinker.*” Nevis grinned. “But there's more. Something I haven't told you. Here,” he said, tossing a fat file folder onto Spector’s lap.

Spector stuck a toothpick in his mouth and looked through the documents.

“Check his school records,” said Nevis.

Spector read them. “Good grades. No disciplinary problems. Straight through to high school graduation.”

“Check the district.”

Spector bit his toothpick so hard it cracked. He spat out the pieces. “This is almost too good. North Mayfield Public School Board, Cincinnati, Ohio—and, oh shit, class of 1952. That's where we test-ran *Idiom*, isn't it?”

“Uh huh,” said Nevis.

Spector picked up his binoculars and watched Miller beg for a few moments.

Nevis continued: “Simplants. False memories. LSD-laced fruit juice. Mass hypnosis. From what I've heard, it was a real fucking mental playground over there.”

“They shut it down in what, fifty-four?”

“Fifty-three. A lot of the guys who worked there went on to *Ultra* and *Monarch*. Some fell off the edge entirely, so you know what that means.”

“And a lot of the subjects ended up dead, or worse—didn't they?”

“Not our guy, though.”

“No.”

“Not yet anyway.” They both laughed, and they soon drove away.

It had started raining, and Donald Miller kept going up to car after car, holding his cardboard sign, now wet and starting to fall apart, collecting spare change from the spared kindness of strangers.

A few days later a black car pulled up to the same intersection. Donald Miller walked up to it and knocked on the driver's side window. Spector was behind the wheel. “Spare any money?” asked Donald Miller, showing his sign, which today said he had one child but that child had a form of cancer whose treatment Miller couldn't afford.

“No, but I can spare you a job,” said Spector.

“A job. *What?*” said Miller.

“Yes. I'm offering you work, Donald.”

“What kind of—hey, how-the-hell do you know my name, huh!”

“Relax, Donald. Get in.”

“No,” said Miller, backing slowly away, almost into another vehicle, whose driver **honked.** Donald jumped. “Don't you want to hear my offer?” asked Spector.

“I don't have the skills for no job, man. Do you think if I had the skills I'd be out here doing this shit?”

“You've already demonstrated the two basic requirements: standing and holding a sign. You're qualified. Now get in the car, please.”

“The *fuck* is this?”

Spector smiled. “Donald, Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office.”

“What, you're fucking crazy, man,” said Miller, his body tensing up, a change coming over his eyes and a self-disbelief over his face. “Who the fuck is—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald. Please get in the car.”

Miller opened his mouth, looked briefly toward the sky, then crossed to the other side of the car, opened the passenger side door, and sat politely beside Spector. When he was settled, Nevis—from the back seat—threw a thick hood over his head and stuck him with a syringe.

Donald Miller woke up naked next to a pile of drab dockworkers’ clothes and a bag of money. He was disoriented, afraid, and about to run when Spector grabbed his arm. “It's all right, Donald,” he said. “You don't need to be afraid. You're in Principal Lewis’ office now. He has a job for you to do. Just put on those clothes.”

“Put them on and do what?”

Miller was looking at the bag of money. He noted
other people here, including a man in a dark suit, and several people with cameras and film equipment. “Like I said before, all you have to do is hold a sign.”

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald. You accepted and willingly got in the car with me. You don't remember the ride because you feel asleep. You were very tired. We didn't want to wake you until you were rested.”

Miller breathed heavily. “Job doing what?”

“Holding a sign.”

“OK, and what's the sign say?”

“It doesn't say anything, Donald—completely blank—just as Principal Lewis likes it.”

“And the clothes, do I get to keep the clothes after we're done. Because you took my old clothes, you…”

“You’ll get new clothes,” said Spector.

“And Principal Lewis wants me to put on these clothes and hold the completely blank sign, and then I’ll get paid and get new clothes?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

So, for the next two weeks, Donald Miller put on various kinds of working clothes, held blank signs, sometimes walked, sometimes stood still, sometimes opened his mouth and sometimes closed it, sometimes sat, or lay down on the ground; or on the floor, because he did all these things in different locations, inside and outside: on an empty factory floor, in a muddy field, on a stretch of traffic-less road. And all the while they took photographs of him and filmed him, and he never knew what any of it meant, why he was doing it. They only spoke to give him directions: “Look angry,” “Pretend you’re starving,” “Look like someone’s about to push you in the back,” “like you’re jostling for position,” “like you’ve had enough and you just can’t fucking take it anymore and whatever you want you’re gonna have to fight for it!”

Then it was over.

Spector shook his hand, they bought him a couple of outfits, paid him his money and sent him on his way. “Sorry, we have to do it this way, but—”

Donald Miller found himself at night in a motel room rented under a name he didn’t recognise, with a printed note saying he could stay as long as he liked. He stayed two days before buying a bus ticket back to Cincinnati, where he was from. He lived well there for a while. The money wasn’t insignificant, and he spent it with restraint, but even the new clothes and money couldn’t wipe the stain of homelessness off him, and he couldn’t convince anyone to give him a job. Less than a year later he was back on the streets begging.

The whole episode—because that’s how he thought about it—was clouded by creamy surreality, which just thickened as time went by until it seemed like it had been a dream, as distant as his time in high school.

One day, several years later, Donald Miller was standing outside an electronics shop, the kind with all the new televisions set up in the display window by the street and turned so that all who passed by could see them and watch and marvel and need to have a set of his own. Miller was watching daytime programming on one of the sets when the broadcast *on all the sets,* which had been showing a few different stations—*cut suddenly to a news alert:*

A few people stopped to watch alongside.

“What’s going on?” a man asked.

“I don’t know,” said Miller.

*On the screens, a handsome news reporter was solemnly reading out a statement about anti-government protests happening in some communist country in eastern Europe. “...they marched again today, in the hundreds of thousands, shouting, ‘We want bread! We want freedom!’ and holding signs denouncing the current regime and imploring the West—and the United States specifically—for help.”* There was more, but Miller had stopped listening. There rose a ***thumping-coursing*** followed by a ***ringing*** in his ears. And his eyes were focused on *the faces of the protestors in the photos and clips the news reporter was speaking over:* because they were his face: **all of them were his face!**

“Hey!” Miller yelled.

The people gathered at the electronics store window looked over at him. “You all right there, buddy?” one asked.

“Don’t you see: it’s me.”

“What’s you?”

“There—” He pointed with a shaking finger at one of the television sets. “—me.”

“Which one, honey?” a woman asked, chuckling.

Miller grabbed her by the shoulders, startling her, saying: “All of them. All of them are me.” And, looking back at the set, he started hitting the display window with his hand. “That one and that one, and that one. That one, that one, that one…”

He grew hysterical, violent; but the people on the street worked together to subdue him, and the owner of the electronics store called the police. The police picked him up, asked him a few questions and drove him to a mental institution. They suggested he stay here, “just for a few days, until you’re better,” and when he insisted he didn’t want to stay there, they changed their suggestion to a command backed by the law and threatened him with charges: assault, resisting arrest, loitering, vagrancy.

Donald Miller was in the institution when the President came on the television and in a serious address to the nation declared that the United States of America, a God fearing and freedom loving people, could no longer stand idly by while another people, equally deserving of freedom, yearning for it, was systematically oppressed. Those people, the President said, would now be saved and welcomed into the arms of the West. After that, the President declared war on the country in which Donald Miller had seen himself protesting against the government.

Once the shock of it passed, being committed wasn’t so bad. It was warm, there was free food and free television, and most of the nurses were nice enough. Sure, there were crazies in there, people who’d bang their heads against the wall or speak in made-up languages, but not everyone was like that, and it was easy to avoid the ones who were. The doctors were the worst part: not because they were cruel but because they were cold, and all they ever did was ask questions and make notes and never tell you what the notes were about. Eventually he even confided in one doctor, a young woman named Angeline, and told her the truth about what had happened to him. He talked to Angeline more often after that, which was fine with him. Then, unexpectedly, Angelina was gone and a man with a buzzcut came to talk to him. “Who are you?” Miller asked. “My name’s Fitzsimmons.” “Are you a doctor?” “No, I’m not a doctor. I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as he *really* loses it.”

“That part’s manageable.”

“I hate to ask this favour, but you know how things are. The current administation—well, the budget’s just not there, which means the agency’s all about finding efficiencies. In that context, a re-used asset’s a real cost-saver.”

“OK,” said Fitzsimmons. “I’ll recommend it.”

“Thanks,” said Spector.

For Donald Miller, committed life went on. Doctor Angeline never came back, and nothing ever came of the Fitzsimmons interview, so Miller assumed he’d flubbed it. The other patients appeared and disappeared, never making much of an impression. Miller suffered through bouts of anxiety, depression and sometimes difficulty telling truth from fiction. The doctors had cured him of his initial delusion that he was actually hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Europe, but doubts remained. He simply learned to keep them internal. Then life got better. Miller made a friend, a new patient named Wellesley. Wellesley was also from Cincinatti, and the two of them got on splendidly. Finally, Miller had someone to talk to—to *really* talk to. As far as Miller saw it, Wellesley’s only flaw was that he was too interested in politics, always going on about international affairs and domestic policy, and how he hated the communists and hated the current administration for not being hard enough on them, and on internal communists, “because those are the worst, Donny. The scheming little rats that live among us.”

Miller didn’t say much of anything about that kind of stuff at first, but when he realized it made Wellesley happy to be humoured, he humoured him. He started repeating Wellesley’s statements to himself at night, and as he repeated them he started believing them. He read books that Wellesley gave him, smuggled into the institution by an acquaintance, like contraband. “And what’s *that* tell you about this great republic of ours? Land of the free, yet we can’t read everything we want to read.” Miller had never been interested in policy before. Now he learned how he was governed, oppressed, undermined by the enemy within. “There’s even some of that ilk in this hospital,” Wellesley told him one evening. “Some of the doctors and staff—they’re pure reds. I’ve heard them talking in the lounge about unions and racial justice.”

“I thought only poor people were communists,” said Miller.

“That’s what they want you to believe, so that if you ever get real mad about it you’ll turn on your fellow man instead of the real enemy: the one in power. Ain’t that a real mad fucking world. Everything’s all messed up. Like take—” Wellesley went silent and shook his head. A nurse walked by. “—no, nevermind, man. I don’t want to get you mixed up in anything.”

“Tell me,” Miller implored him.

“Like, well, take—take the President. He says all the right things in public, but that’s only to get elected. If you look at what he’s actually doing, like the policies and the appointments and where he spends *our* money, you can see his true fucking colours.”

Later they talked about revolutions, the American, the French, the Russian, and how if things got too bad the only way out was violence. “But it’s not always like that. The violence doesn’t have to be total. It can be smart, targeted. You take out the right person at the right time and maybe you save a million lives.

“Don’t you agree?” asked Wellesley.

“I guess...”

“Come on—you can be more honest than that. It’s just the two of us here. Two dregs of society that no one gives a shit about.”

“I agree,” said Miller.

Wellesley slapped him on the shoulder. “You know what?”

“What?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

Three months later, much to his surprise, Donald Miller was released from the mental institution he’d spent the last few years in. He even got a little piece of paper that declared him sane. He tried writing Wellesley a few times from the outside, but he never got a response. When he got up the courage to show up at the institution, he was told by a nurse that she shouldn’t be telling him this *but that Wellesley had taken his own life soon after Miller was released.*

Alone again, Donald Miller tried integrating into society, but it was tough going. He couldn’t make friends, and he couldn’t hold down a job. He was a hard worker but always too weird. People didn’t like him, or found him off-putting or creepy, or sometimes they intentionally made his life so unbearable he had to leave, then they pretended they were sorry to see him go. No one ever said anything true or concrete, like, “You stink,” or “You don’t shave regularly enough,” or “Your cologne smells cheap.” It was always merely hinted at, suggested. He was different. He didn’t belong. He felt unwelcome everywhere. His only solace was books, because books never judged him. He realized he hated the world around him, and whenever the President was on television, he hated the President too.

“You've already demonstrated the two basic requirements: standing and holding a sign. You're qualified. Now get in the car, please.”

“The *fuck* is this?”

Spector smiled. “Donald, Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office.”

“What, you're fucking crazy, man,” said Miller, his body tensing up, a change coming over his eyes and a self-disbelief over his face. “Who the fuck is—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald. Please get in the car.”

Miller opened his mouth, looked briefly toward the sky, then crossed to the other side of the car, opened the passenger side door, and sat politely beside Spector. When he was settled, Nevis—from the back seat—threw a thick hood over his head and stuck him with a syringe.

Donald Miller woke up naked next to a pile of drab dockworkers’ clothes and a bag of money. He was disoriented, afraid, and about to run when Spector grabbed his arm. “It's all right, Donald,” he said. “You don't need to be afraid. You're in Principal Lewis’ office now. He has a job for you to do. Just put on those clothes.”

“Put them on and do what?”

Miller was looking at the bag of money. He noted
other people here, including a man in a dark suit, and several people with cameras and film equipment. “Like I said before, all you have to do is hold a sign.”

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald. You accepted and willingly got in the car with me. You don't remember the ride because you feel asleep. You were very tired. We didn't want to wake you until you were rested.”

Miller breathed heavily. “Job doing what?”

“Holding a sign.”

“OK, and what's the sign say?”

“It doesn't say anything, Donald—completely blank—just as Principal Lewis likes it.”

“And the clothes, do I get to keep the clothes after we're done. Because you took my old clothes, you…”

“You’ll get new clothes,” said Spector.

“And Principal Lewis wants me to put on these clothes and hold the completely blank sign, and then I’ll get paid and get new clothes?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

So, for the next two weeks, Donald Miller put on various kinds of working clothes, held blank signs, sometimes walked, sometimes stood still, sometimes opened his mouth and sometimes closed it, sometimes sat, or lay down on the ground; or on the floor, because he did all these things in different locations, inside and outside: on an empty factory floor, in a muddy field, on a stretch of traffic-less road. And all the while they took photographs of him and filmed him, and he never knew what any of it meant, why he was doing it. They only spoke to give him directions: “Look angry,” “Pretend you’re starving,” “Look like someone’s about to push you in the back,” “like you’re jostling for position,” “like you’ve had enough and you just can’t fucking take it anymore and whatever you want you’re gonna have to fight for it!”

Then it was over.

Spector shook his hand, they bought him a couple of outfits, paid him his money and sent him on his way. “Sorry, we have to do it this way, but—”

Donald Miller found himself at night in a motel room rented under a name he didn’t recognise, with a printed note saying he could stay as long as he liked. He stayed two days before buying a bus ticket back to Cincinnati, where he was from. He lived well there for a while. The money wasn’t insignificant, and he spent it with restraint, but even the new clothes and money couldn’t wipe the stain of homelessness off him, and he couldn’t convince anyone to give him a job. Less than a year later he was back on the streets begging.

The whole episode—because that’s how he thought about it—was clouded by creamy surreality, which just thickened as time went by until it seemed like it had been a dream, as distant as his time in high school.

One day, several years later, Donald Miller was standing outside an electronics shop, the kind with all the new televisions set up in the display window by the street and turned so that all who passed by could see them and watch and marvel and need to have a set of his own. Miller was watching daytime programming on one of the sets when the broadcast *on all the sets,* which had been showing a few different stations—*cut suddenly to a news alert:*

A few people stopped to watch alongside.

“What’s going on?” a man asked.

“I don’t know,” said Miller.

*On the screens, a handsome news reporter was solemnly reading out a statement about anti-government protests happening in some communist country in eastern Europe. “...they marched again today, in the hundreds of thousands, shouting, ‘We want bread! We want freedom!’ and holding signs denouncing the current regime and imploring the West—and the United States specifically—for help.”* There was more, but Miller had stopped listening. There rose a ***thumping-coursing*** followed by a ***ringing*** in his ears. And his eyes were focused on *the faces of the protestors in the photos and clips the news reporter was speaking over:* because they were his face: **all of them were his face!**

“Hey!” Miller yelled.

The people gathered at the electronics store window looked over at him. “You all right there, buddy?” one asked.

“Don’t you see: it’s me.”

“What’s you?”

“There—” He pointed with a shaking finger at one of the television sets. “—me.”

“Which one, honey?” a woman asked, chuckling.

Miller grabbed her by the shoulders, startling her, saying: “All of them. All of them are me.” And, looking back at the set, he started hitting the display window with his hand. “That one and that one, and that one. That one, that one, that one…”

He grew hysterical, violent; but the people on the street worked together to subdue him, and the owner of the electronics store called the police. The police picked him up, asked him a few questions and drove him to a mental institution. They suggested he stay here, “just for a few days, until you’re better,” and when he insisted he didn’t want to stay there, they changed their suggestion to a command backed by the law and threatened him with charges: assault, resisting arrest, loitering, vagrancy.

Donald Miller was in the institution when the President came on the television and in a serious address to the nation declared that the United States of America, a God fearing and freedom loving people, could no longer stand idly by while another people, equally deserving of freedom, yearning for it, was systematically oppressed. Those people, the President said, would now be saved and welcomed into the arms of the West. After that, the President declared war on the country in which Donald Miller had seen himself protesting against the government.

Once the shock of it passed, being committed wasn’t so bad. It was warm, there was free food and free television, and most of the nurses were nice enough. Sure, there were crazies in there, people who’d bang their heads against the wall or speak in made-up languages, but not everyone was like that, and it was easy to avoid the ones who were. The doctors were the worst part: not because they were cruel but because they were cold, and all they ever did was ask questions and make notes and never tell you what the notes were about. Eventually he even confided in one doctor, a young woman named Angeline, and told her the truth about what had happened to him. He talked to Angeline more often after that, which was fine with him. Then, unexpectedly, Angelina was gone and a man with a buzzcut came to talk to him. “Who are you?” Miller asked. “My name’s Fitzsimmons.” “Are you a doctor?” “No, I’m not a doctor. I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as he *really* loses it.”

“That part’s manageable.”

“I hate to ask this favour, but you know how things are. The current administation—well, the budget’s just not there, which means the agency’s all about finding efficiencies. In that context, a re-used asset’s a real cost-saver.”

“OK,” said Fitzsimmons. “I’ll recommend it.”

“Thanks,” said Spector.

For Donald Miller, committed life went on. Doctor Angeline never came back, and nothing ever came of the Fitzsimmons interview, so Miller assumed he’d flubbed it. The other patients appeared and disappeared, never making much of an impression. Miller suffered through bouts of anxiety, depression and sometimes difficulty telling truth from fiction. The doctors had cured him of his initial delusion that he was actually hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Europe, but doubts remained. He simply learned to keep them internal. Then life got better. Miller made a friend, a new patient named Wellesley. Wellesley was also from Cincinatti, and the two of them got on splendidly. Finally, Miller had someone to talk to—to *really* talk to. As far as Miller saw it, Wellesley’s only flaw was that he was too interested in politics, always going on about international affairs and domestic policy, and how he hated the communists and hated the current administration for not being hard enough on them, and on internal communists, “because those are the worst, Donny. The scheming little rats that live among us.”

Miller didn’t say much of anything about that kind of stuff at first, but when he realized it made Wellesley happy to be humoured, he humoured him. He started repeating Wellesley’s statements to himself at night, and as he repeated them he started believing them. He read books that Wellesley gave him, smuggled into the institution by an acquaintance, like contraband. “And what’s *that* tell you about this great republic of ours? Land of the free, yet we can’t read everything we want to read.” Miller had never been interested in policy before. Now he learned how he was governed, oppressed, undermined by the enemy within. “There’s even some of that ilk in this hospital,” Wellesley told him one evening. “Some of the doctors and staff—they’re pure reds. I’ve heard them talking in the lounge about unions and racial justice.”

“I thought only poor people were communists,” said Miller.

“That’s what they want you to believe, so that if you ever get real mad about it you’ll turn on your fellow man instead of the real enemy: the one in power. Ain’t that a real mad fucking world. Everything’s all messed up. Like take—” Wellesley went silent and shook his head. A nurse walked by. “—no, nevermind, man. I don’t want to get you mixed up in anything.”

“Tell me,” Miller implored him.

“Like, well, take—take the President. He says all the right things in public, but that’s only to get elected. If you look at what he’s actually doing, like the policies and the appointments and where he spends *our* money, you can see his true fucking colours.”

Later they talked about revolutions, the American, the French, the Russian, and how if things got too bad the only way out was violence. “But it’s not always like that. The violence doesn’t have to be total. It can be smart, targeted. You take out the right person at the right time and maybe you save a million lives.

“Don’t you agree?” asked Wellesley.

“I guess...”

“Come on—you can be more honest than that. It’s just the two of us here. Two dregs of society that no one gives a shit about.”

“I agree,” said Miller.

Wellesley slapped him on the shoulder. “You know what?”

“What?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

Three months later, much to his surprise, Donald Miller was released from the mental institution he’d spent the last few years in. He even got a little piece of paper that declared him sane. He tried writing Wellesley a few times from the outside, but he never got a response. When he got up the courage to show up at the institution, he was told by a nurse that she shouldn’t be telling him this *but that Wellesley had taken his own life soon after Miller was released.*

Alone again, Donald Miller tried integrating into society, but it was tough going. He couldn’t make friends, and he couldn’t hold down a job. He was a hard worker but always too weird. People didn’t like him, or found him off-putting or creepy, or sometimes they intentionally made his life so unbearable he had to leave, then they pretended they were sorry to see him go. No one ever said anything true or concrete, like, “You stink,” or “You don’t shave regularly enough,” or “Your cologne smells cheap.” It was always merely hinted at, suggested. He was different. He didn’t belong. He felt unwelcome everywhere. His only solace was books, because books never judged him. He realized he hated the world around him, and whenever the President was on television, he hated the President too.

One day, Donald Miller woke up and knew exactly what he needed to do.

After all, he was a bright guy.

It was three weeks before Christmas. The snow was coming down slowly in big white flakes. The mood was magical, and Spector was sitting at a table in an upscale New York City restaurant with his wife and kids, ordering French wine and *magret de canard,* which was just a fancy French term for duck breast. The lighting was low so you could see winter through the big windows. A jazz band was playing something by Duke Ellington. Then the restaurant’s phone rang. Someone picked up. “Yes?” Somebody *whispered.* “Now?” asked the person who’d picked up the call. A commotion began, spreading from the staff to the diners and back to the staff, until someone turned a television on in the kitchen, and someone else dropped a glass, and a woman screamed as the glass shattered and a man yelled, “Oh my God, he’s been shot! The President’s been shot.”

At those words everyone in the restaurant jumped—*everyone but Spector,* who calmly swallowed the duck he’d been chewing, picked up his glass of wine and made a silent toast to the future of the agency.

The dinner was, understandably, cut short, and everyone made their way out to their cars to drive home through the falling snow. In his car, Spector assured his family that everything would be fine. Then he listened without comment as his wife and daughter exchanged uninformed opinions about *who would do such a terrible thing* and *what if we’re under attack* and *maybe it’s the Soviet Union…*

As he pulled into the street on which their hotel was located, Spector noticed a black car with tinted windows idling across from the hotel entrance. 

Passing, he waved, *and the car merged into traffic and drove obediently away.*",1,1762569002.0,Odd_directions,2,0.67,False

Shortly after we got married, she told me that she is bi-polar and hid that from me until we got married because ""I didnt want you leaving."" I have been called names, ""youre a shifty father"" etc etc during her anger moments. 2 years ago she was admitted and diagnosed with Bi-polar and BPD. In the last 6 months, we have been struggling alot. 

Yesterday when I got off work, she was making moves on me. Teasing me until the kids went to bed. When they went to bed, we both had our own time to whine down. She asked me to come upstairs to bed and watch shows, and I agreed. An hour later, I asked her if/when things were going to ""Happen"" as I was getting tired. She said she wasn't feeling it. Normally I'd be fine with that answer, but Ive been communicating for months now if she could atleast plan and/or make a move so I could feel desired too, because normally its me planning it all. Anyways, shortly after that, I asked her if she just wanted to bath and go to bed. She agreed. Once we got into the bathroom, she asked if something was wrong. I told her I was a bit upset and sad that everytime she promises and plans something like that, which has happened for 6 months now, she sabotages it one way or the other. 

She got angry and defensive because I said I was upset. Told me I shouldn't feel that way. I told her I wasn't mad and just wanted to have a conversation, which made her more angry. I went to bed feeling anxious.

In the morning when we woke up, she was all happy and lovey. Trying to make me happy with buying me breakfast and coffee. She made a comment ""Are you still butthurt over me overreacting last night?"" I said I was still a bit upset, but making comments like that only makes things worse(which she makes often). She made a few comments under her breath and then said I'll give your space today. I agreed. I left work early today to drive her to her doctors appointment. When I got home to get her, she didnt say a word to me. She was very angry. I was trying to be supportive and even attended her appointment with her. She was very rude and combative. I asked her what she wanted for lunch and she gave me an awful look and said ""Im not hungry."" So I got myself lunch. The whole ride home until now, she hasn't looked at me and has been extremely rude to me, especially infront of the kids. She asked me to go get her a Starbucks after this tonight, and I declined stating why should I do something nice for you when you can't even respect me. ",3,1762568982.0,AITAH,4,0.81,False
1ordrcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1ordrcs/spooks/,Spooks,"It was a busy intersection and the weather was bad, but Donald Miller was out there, knocking on car windows while holding a sign that said:

    single dad
    out of work
    2 kids
    please help

He was thirty-four years old.

He'd been homeless for almost two years.

He knocked on a driver's side window and the driver shook her head, not even making eye contact. The next lowered his window and told him to get a fucking job. Sometimes people asked where his kids were while he was out here. It was a fair question. Sometimes they spat at him. Sometimes they got really pissed because they had to work hard for their dime while he was out here begging for it. *A leech on society. A deadbeat. A liar. A fraud, a cheat, a swindler, a drain on the better elements of the world.* But usually they just ignored him. Once in a while they gave him some money, and that was what happened now as a woman distastefully held a ten-dollar bill out the window. “Thank you, ma'am,” said Miller, taking it. “Feed your children,” said the woman. Then the light changed from red to green and the woman drove off. Miller stepped off the street onto the paved shoulder, waited for the next red light, the next group of cars, and repeated.

“It's almost Fordian,” said Spector.

Nevis nodded, pouring coffee from a paper cup into his mouth. “Mhm.”

The pair of them were observing Miller through binoculars from behind the tinted windshield of their black spook car, parked an inconspicuous distance away. Spector continued: “It's like capitalism's chewed him up for so long he's applied capitalist praxis to panhandling. I mean, look: it’s a virtual assembly line, and there he dutifully goes, station to demeaning station, for an entire shift.”

“Yeah,” said Nevis.

The traffic lights changed a few times.

The radio played Janis Joplin.

“So,” said Nevis, holding an empty paper coffee cup, “you sure he's our guy?”

“I'm sure. No wife, no kids, no friends or relatives.”

“Ain't what his sign says.”

“Today.”

“Yeah, today.”

(Yesterday, Miller had been stranded in the city after getting mugged and needed money to get back to Pittsburgh, but that apparently didn't pull as hard on the heartstrings.)

“And you said he was in the army?”

“Sure was.”

“What stripe was he?”

“Didn't get past first, so I wouldn't count on his conditioning too much.”

“Didn't consider him suitable—or what?”

“Got tossed out before they could get the hooks into his head. Couldn't keep his opinions on point or to himself. Spoke his mind. *Independent thinker.*” Nevis grinned. “But there's more. Something I haven't told you. Here,” he said, tossing a fat file folder onto Spector’s lap.

Spector stuck a toothpick in his mouth and looked through the documents.

“Check his school records,” said Nevis.

Spector read them. “Good grades. No disciplinary problems. Straight through to high school graduation.”

“Check the district.”

Spector bit his toothpick so hard it cracked. He spat out the pieces. “This is almost too good. North Mayfield Public School Board, Cincinnati, Ohio—and, oh shit, class of 1952. That's where we test-ran *Idiom*, isn't it?”

“Uh huh,” said Nevis.

Spector picked up his binoculars and watched Miller beg for a few moments.

Nevis continued: “Simplants. False memories. LSD-laced fruit juice. Mass hypnosis. From what I've heard, it was a real fucking mental playground over there.”

“They shut it down in what, fifty-four?”

“Fifty-three. A lot of the guys who worked there went on to *Ultra* and *Monarch*. Some fell off the edge entirely, so you know what that means.”

“And a lot of the subjects ended up dead, or worse—didn't they?”

“Not our guy, though.”

“No.”

“Not yet anyway.” They both laughed, and they soon drove away.

It had started raining, and Donald Miller kept going up to car after car, holding his cardboard sign, now wet and starting to fall apart, collecting spare change from the spared kindness of strangers.

A few days later a black car pulled up to the same intersection. Donald Miller walked up to it and knocked on the driver's side window. Spector was behind the wheel. “Spare any money?” asked Donald Miller, showing his sign, which today said he had one child but that child had a form of cancer whose treatment Miller couldn't afford.

“No, but I can spare you a job,” said Spector.

“A job. *What?*” said Miller.

“Yes. I'm offering you work, Donald.”

“What kind of—hey, how-the-hell do you know my name, huh!”

“Relax, Donald. Get in.”

“No,” said Miller, backing slowly away, almost into another vehicle, whose driver **honked.** Donald jumped. “Don't you want to hear my offer?” asked Spector.

“I don't have the skills for no job, man. Do you think if I had the skills I'd be out here doing this shit?”

“You've already demonstrated the two basic requirements: standing and holding a sign. You're qualified. Now get in the car, please.”

“The *fuck* is this?”

Spector smiled. “Donald, Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office.”

“What, you're fucking crazy, man,” said Miller, his body tensing up, a change coming over his eyes and a self-disbelief over his face. “Who the fuck is—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald. Please get in the car.”

“Put them on and do what?”

Miller was looking at the bag of money. He noted
other people here, including a man in a dark suit, and several people with cameras and film equipment. “Like I said before, all you have to do is hold a sign.”

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald. You accepted and willingly got in the car with me. You don't remember the ride because you feel asleep. You were very tired. We didn't want to wake you until you were rested.”

Miller breathed heavily. “Job doing what?”

“Holding a sign.”

“OK, and what's the sign say?”

“It doesn't say anything, Donald—completely blank—just as Principal Lewis likes it.”

“And the clothes, do I get to keep the clothes after we're done. Because you took my old clothes, you…”

“You’ll get new clothes,” said Spector.

“And Principal Lewis wants me to put on these clothes and hold the completely blank sign, and then I’ll get paid and get new clothes?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

So, for the next two weeks, Donald Miller put on various kinds of working clothes, held blank signs, sometimes walked, sometimes stood still, sometimes opened his mouth and sometimes closed it, sometimes sat, or lay down on the ground; or on the floor, because he did all these things in different locations, inside and outside: on an empty factory floor, in a muddy field, on a stretch of traffic-less road. And all the while they took photographs of him and filmed him, and he never knew what any of it meant, why he was doing it. They only spoke to give him directions: “Look angry,” “Pretend you’re starving,” “Look like someone’s about to push you in the back,” “like you’re jostling for position,” “like you’ve had enough and you just can’t fucking take it anymore and whatever you want you’re gonna have to fight for it!”

Then it was over.

Spector shook his hand, they bought him a couple of outfits, paid him his money and sent him on his way. “Sorry, we have to do it this way, but—”

Donald Miller found himself at night in a motel room rented under a name he didn’t recognise, with a printed note saying he could stay as long as he liked.

I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as he *really* loses it.”

“That part’s manageable.”

“I hate to ask this favour, but you know how things are. The current administation—well, the budget’s just not there, which means the agency’s all about finding efficiencies. In that context, a re-used asset’s a real cost-saver.”

“OK,” said Fitzsimmons. “I’ll recommend it.”

“Thanks,” said Spector.

For Donald Miller, committed life went on. Doctor Angeline never came back, and nothing ever came of the Fitzsimmons interview, so Miller assumed he’d flubbed it. The other patients appeared and disappeared, never making much of an impression. Miller suffered through bouts of anxiety, depression and sometimes difficulty telling truth from fiction. The doctors had cured him of his initial delusion that he was actually hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Europe, but doubts remained. He simply learned to keep them internal. Then life got better. Miller made a friend, a new patient named Wellesley. Wellesley was also from Cincinatti, and the two of them got on splendidly. Finally, Miller had someone to talk to—to *really* talk to. As far as Miller saw it, Wellesley’s only flaw was that he was too interested in politics, always going on about international affairs and domestic policy, and how he hated the communists and hated the current administration for not being hard enough on them, and on internal communists, “because those are the worst, Donny. The scheming little rats that live among us.”

Miller didn’t say much of anything about that kind of stuff at first, but when he realized it made Wellesley happy to be humoured, he humoured him. He started repeating Wellesley’s statements to himself at night, and as he repeated them he started believing them. He read books that Wellesley gave him, smuggled into the institution by an acquaintance, like contraband. “And what’s *that* tell you about this great republic of ours? Land of the free, yet we can’t read everything we want to read.” Miller had never been interested in policy before. Now he learned how he was governed, oppressed, undermined by the enemy within. “There’s even some of that ilk in this hospital,” Wellesley told him one evening. “Some of the doctors and staff—they’re pure reds. I’ve heard them talking in the lounge about unions and racial justice.”

“I thought only poor people were communists,” said Miller.

“That’s what they want you to believe, so that if you ever get real mad about it you’ll turn on your fellow man instead of the real enemy: the one in power. Ain’t that a real mad fucking world. Everything’s all messed up. Like take—” Wellesley went silent and shook his head. A nurse walked by. “—no, nevermind, man. I don’t want to get you mixed up in anything.”

“Tell me,” Miller implored him.

“Like, well, take—take the President. He says all the right things in public, but that’s only to get elected. If you look at what he’s actually doing, like the policies and the appointments and where he spends *our* money, you can see his true fucking colours.”

Later they talked about revolutions, the American, the French, the Russian, and how if things got too bad the only way out was violence. “But it’s not always like that. The violence doesn’t have to be total. It can be smart, targeted. You take out the right person at the right time and maybe you save a million lives.

“Don’t you agree?” asked Wellesley.

“I guess...”

“Come on—you can be more honest than that. It’s just the two of us here. Two dregs of society that no one gives a shit about.”

“I agree,” said Miller.

Wellesley slapped him on the shoulder. “You know what?”

“What?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

Three months later, much to his surprise, Donald Miller was released from the mental institution he’d spent the last few years in. He even got a little piece of paper that declared him sane. He tried writing Wellesley a few times from the outside, but he never got a response. When he got up the courage to show up at the institution, he was told by a nurse that she shouldn’t be telling him this *but that Wellesley had taken his own life soon after Miller was released.*

Alone again, Donald Miller tried integrating into society, but it was tough going. He couldn’t make friends, and he couldn’t hold down a job. He was a hard worker but always too weird. People didn’t like him, or found him off-putting or creepy, or sometimes they intentionally made his life so unbearable he had to leave, then they pretended they were sorry to see him go. No one ever said anything true or concrete, like, “You stink,” or “You don’t shave regularly enough,” or “Your cologne smells cheap.” It was always merely hinted at, suggested. He was different. He didn’t belong. He felt unwelcome everywhere. His only solace was books, because books never judged him. He realized he hated the world around him, and whenever the President was on television, he hated the President too.

One day, Donald Miller woke up and knew exactly what he needed to do.

After all, he was a bright guy.

It was three weeks before Christmas. The snow was coming down slowly in big white flakes. The mood was magical, and Spector was sitting at a table in an upscale New York City restaurant with his wife and kids, ordering French wine and *magret de canard,* which was just a fancy French term for duck breast. The lighting was low so you could see winter through the big windows. A jazz band was playing something by Duke Ellington. Then the restaurant’s phone rang. Someone picked up. “Yes?” Somebody *whispered.* “Now?” asked the person who’d picked up the call. A commotion began, spreading from the staff to the diners and back to the staff, until someone turned a television on in the kitchen, and someone else dropped a glass, and a woman screamed as the glass shattered and a man yelled, “Oh my God, he’s been shot! The President’s been shot.”

At those words everyone in the restaurant jumped—*everyone but Spector,* who calmly swallowed the duck he’d been chewing, picked up his glass of wine and made a silent toast to the future of the agency.

The dinner was, understandably, cut short, and everyone made their way out to their cars to drive home through the falling snow. In his car, Spector assured his family that everything would be fine. Then he listened without comment as his wife and daughter exchanged uninformed opinions about *who would do such a terrible thing* and *what if we’re under attack* and *maybe it’s the Soviet Union…*

As he pulled into the street on which their hotel was located, Spector noticed a black car with tinted windows idling across from the hotel entrance. 

Passing, he waved, *and the car merged into traffic and drove obediently away.*",2,1762568969.0,horrorstories,1,1.0,False

I’m F late 20s, I’ve been focusing on recovery from a life-long ED cocktail, with bulimia dominating most of my life. I’m doing a little (a lot?) better these days, except for a current 2ish week-long dark patch fuelled by depression and a running injury throwing me off the comforting routines and leading to dopamine seeking and escapism through bp. 

With the holiday season coming up, I’ve been thinking how horrendous it all felt last year - the amplified food noise and guilt, the deep desire to partake in the festivities and feel normal again, feeling intense guilt when I slip up and bp and have to miss social events, which turns into a horrid spiral… worst of all - not having anyone to confide in. 

I’m hoping to do better this year and let myself be happy for once and enjoy the summer. If anyone feels like connecting, please dm me. I was thinking maybe little meetups for nice coffee walks, or even just a local virtual mini community where we can vent and support each other.

1ordo4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1ordo4j/which_backpacking_stove_works_best_for_quick_meals/,Which backpacking stove works best for quick meals?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been backpacking for about three years now, and one question I always get asked is about which backpacking stove actually works best when you just want to eat and get back on the trail.

Let me save you some time and money by sharing what I've learned.

**What Actually Matters in a Backpacking Stove**

Look, when you're hungry after hiking 10 miles, you don't want to mess around for 20 minutes trying to boil water. You want something that lights fast, boils quick, and doesn't weigh a ton in your pack.

The best backpacking stoves for quick meals are canister stoves. Period. They're literally ready to go in seconds, and most can boil water in under 4 minutes. Compare that to alcohol stoves or wood-burning ones that take forever.

**My Experience with Different Types**

I started with an alcohol stove because it was cheap. Big mistake for quick meals. It took forever to boil water, and I couldn't control the flame well. Then I tried a wood-burning stove, which was cool for the environment but terrible when I was starving and just wanted instant noodles.

Canister stoves changed everything. You screw on the fuel canister, turn a knob, click the igniter, and boom – you're cooking. Perfect for dehydrated meals, coffee, or anything that needs hot water fast.

**What to Look For**

Weight is huge. If your camping stove weighs more than 4 ounces, it's probably too heavy unless you're car camping. Fuel efficiency matters too because you don't want to carry extra canisters.

Stability is another thing people forget about. Your lightweight stove means nothing if it tips over and spills your dinner.

I put together a list of the best options I've tested and researched. You can check them out here: https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove

**Quick Tips for Faster Cooking**

Use a windscreen. Seriously, wind kills your boil time and wastes fuel. Even a DIY aluminum foil windscreen helps.

Pre-measure your water. Don't overfill your pot because extra water takes extra time and fuel.

Keep your fuel canister warm. Cold canisters perform worse, so I sleep with mine in my sleeping bag on cold nights (sounds weird but it works).

**My Top Recommendation**

After trying different portable stoves and ultralight options, I honestly think canister stoves with piezo ignition are the sweet spot for quick meals. They're reliable, fast, and easy to use even when you're tired.

If you want to see specific models with reviews and current prices, I'd recommend checking out this page: https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove

They've got solid options for different budgets and needs.

**Bottom Line**

Don't overthink it. If you want quick meals on the trail, get a canister stove. They're not the absolute lightest or cheapest option, but they're the fastest and most convenient. Your hungry self will thank you after a long day of hiking.

1ordo3y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ordo3y,SAECO Xelsis Grinder BEAN LESS FACTOR adjustment,"SAECO Xelsis SUP038 has been throwing out ground coffee when the bean hopper is actually full.  Grinder motor runs well and is clean and lubricated.  Pulls about 100 mA at 24V no beans.  The Hall Effect sensor appears to be working OK and is also clean.

In Service menu the Grinder Unit test trips the BEAN\_LESS ALARM when running the BEAN\_LESS TEST on most runs with BEAN\_LESS values less than 15, even with beans in the hopper.  Completely empty and clean grinder returns BEAN\_LESS values of 5 and 6 repeatedly for 20 cycles.  Adding beans to factory set grinder home position resulted in BEAN\_LESS of 12.  This is still less than the BEAN\_LESS FACTOR of 15.  Adjusting for finer grind results in a BEAN\_LESS of 17 and no BEAN\_LESS ALARM.  However, power cycle and repeat test results in a BEAN\_LESS of 7 and an alarm with no change in grinder adjustments.  

The attached chart is from the service manual and explains how the detection system works.  Can anyone correlate the BEAN\_LESS values and the BEAN\_LESS FACTOR with t1, t2, t3 and t4?

Is there a reset or calibrate hidden somewhere in the service menu?  I have seen that on other models and expect there is some process to start the Xelsis on learning a new grinder.

I have only seen one service menu on the machine, but I expect there are others.

I noticed a coin cell battery soldered onto the main control board.  I expect that battery is no longer providing backup power for settings.  Could that be a factor?  The machine seems to be retaining time and date OK.

My best friend of five years(24F) and I(23F) planned for me to visit her during her semester abroad. We were so excited and spent months planning things to do. I booked a three-week stay, long enough to explore without rushing and to give her time to study and relax. She told me to leave everything to her and just focus on my solo plans.

A month before my trip, she told me her guy friend would be visiting for a week during my stay, and that we’d need to rearrange things so she could be with him. I was upset since I’d already booked hotels and appointments (tattoo, hair, and some special events). She promised to make it up to me with a weekend trip to the neighbouring country and said the guy would help with luggage, take pictures, and pay for dinner. She said my being mad was unreasonable as he was “travelling so far just to see her.” (What was I? A sack of onions?). I gave in and hoped it would still be a good trip.

When I arrived, she said we’d explore the local area, a port city, and then cross the border for the weekend. In reality, it was three exhausting days of constant travel with barely a day in each place. She was actively tiring herself out with her own rushed plans and thus refused to go out or do anything. She started to constantly belittle me, snap at me over the smallest things or whine over everything. A couple of things she said really hurt me deeply but I didn't want to ruin the trip so I tried to look past it.

At the end of the week, she left to meet the guy. We agreed to meet up later in the capital to try and salvage the trip. The first time, I waited two hours before she showed up, alone. We went to a few stores and had a late lunch where she told me she was planning to go steady with him before heading back. The second time, we met for a beauty treatment. I asked if she wanted to do anything after, but she said she had to get back to their hotel. Later, she texted that they’d changed their minds and wanted to go sightseeing. I took three trains to meet them, after she sent wrong directions three times, and then made it there only to find out they got bored and had already left. When I asked ""What gives?"" she just said “Oopsie” and stopped responding. I finally told her that I don't appreciate her behaviour, that I'll take it as her sign to indicate that our trip was over and to enjoy her time with her new man.

This was someone who used to visit me at work with coffee, plan trips with me, have wine nights, and be my biggest supporter. I was visiting her in my dream country (that I encouraged her to go to in the first place) and it was supposed to be amazing, but one week in, I regretted ever making plans for it. The country was beautiful, and I did my best to enjoy it, but I felt hurt, alone, and deeply disappointed.

Months later, she invited me to her “welcome home” party with friends, to talk about her “wonderful time abroad.” I’d waited for her to acknowledge what had happened, but she never did. So I sent a long message explaining how hurt and disappointed I was, how unfairly she’d treated me, and how angry I was that she ignored my feelings on the matter. I ended it by saying ""I’d rather check myself into a psych ward than come to your sh*tshow!""

She never responded to that. When mutual friends asked if she’d ever want to fix things, she said she’d love to, but was “so terribly busy"" and just last year she unfollowed me on social media. Am I the Jerk?",3,1762568554.0,AmITheJerk,2,1.0,False

In 2013 a group of archeologists working in the mojave desert uncovered a strange chamber buried beneath the sand. They worked tirelessly around the clock for th next 2 weeks in order to dig it out. Finally, once the entrance had been uncovered, the archologists managed to use a crowbar to unseal the ancient stone door. Once inside they were astonished to discover a series of intricately carved and painted beautiful murals. Carbon dating placed them at over 20,000 years old. The archiologists took many photos of the murals and prepared to come back with an even larger team to keep exploring the mysterious room and look into th esurounding area to see if they could unearth any other relics. Not one of those archologists returned to that dig site. In fact, after that night no one ever saw them again, and all evidence of the digsite and any photographs taken was seemingly scrubbed from th eface of the panet. 

Only 1 single photo of those murals survived, and MK managed to dig it up from a secret shadow government site on the evil internet (its like the internet, but evil). The photo is grainy and blurry because for some reason the archiologists decided to use ass old cameras from lik ethe 80s instead of idk a fucking iphone i mean come on guys it was 2013 for crying out loud. 

Anyway, like i said only 1 photo remained, and you literally cant see anything in it BUT after putting it into photoshop myself and digitally manipulating the photo by writing TANIS on it in red marker you can clearly see one word written in red on the wall…. One word that will sound very familiar… one word that is…… TANIS

TANIS BOOM

Welcome back to Tanis, Im Nic Silver. We’re telling the story of tanis, in order, every 2 weeks, so if your new to tanis you should turn off your phone, take out your earbuds, and forget that you ever heard of this show. Trust me, it will ruin your life. If your not new to tanis, once again im sorry. I genuinely didnt know that I was accidentally performing an ancient mematic occult ritual within my podcast that would affect every single listener causing them to all have their orgaNS inverted and their minds taken over by eld fen. BUT since you all are here to stay forever i guess ill keep making more show.

\*gentle tanis music and raiudio chatter…. Have you given anymore thought… to coming to work with me? There he is there he is there he is…. Kzzt 38179….\*

When we left you last time MK, kARL AND myself had just managed to lose our mysterious persuers and make it to the relative safety of a crowded seattle coffee shop.

MK: Ok so who the hell were those guys Nic?

NIC: I have no idea. I didnt recognize any of them

Karl: I think I might have

NIC: Karl?

Karl: Im not sure if i should talk about it….

MK: oh for crying out loud karl you need to tell us whats going on those guys were trying to kill us

Karl: it was a long time ago

Nic: karl fuck you your not allowed to by mysterious and cryptic only I am

Karl: oh right sorry nic i forgot that was your thing

Nic: thank you

Karl: ok so basically back when i was in th army right around when i was in pakistan. One night I when i was on watch up in a high lookout tower i saw a bright light appear in the sky, it moved strangely and erratically. Even using my binoculars and scopes i couldnt make out what it was. I was right about to call it in when it zipped over to me and hovered right above my tower. It was a UFO.

NIc: what the hell? You cant be serious Karl a ufo?

MK: yea i mean evil movies that murder you are one thing but i mean phht come on aliens?

Karl: im serious guys they even abducted me and i cant remember much because they erased my memory and shit but im pretty sure that the guys chasing us back there were the same people who i remember seeing on the ship with the aliens

Nic: Well i think i know how we can find out for sure

It sounded crazy , but what if karl was telling th etruth? What if he really had been abducted by aliens and then had his memory erased? And how might these mysterious incidents relate to Tanis? I had a feeling a knew what i needed to do but I wasnt looking forward to it. Thighs hadnet ended quite so well the last time id spoken to this person.

Mk: Nic your fucking with us right? Why did you bring us here

We were standing in front of my former sleep therapist/ hypnosis doctor’s office. Dr. bernier had drugged me and sold my personal medical documents to tesla nova but she was literally the only hypnotherapist in seattle so we didnt have any other choice.

We entered dr bernier’s office. She had 13 new receptionists. They were all playing candy crush on 5th generation ipod touches for some reason. It was a strange sight.

Nic: Um hello is doctor bernier avaqilable we need to speak with her

Receptionist 32: ummmm like sorry no she like left to go on a 2 month long 	VACAY to bali and also she like gve us this

She handed me a laminated flyer with a photo of my face on it and the words: BANNED FROM HYPNOTHERAPY PERMANANTLY written under it.

Nic: oh

Receptinist 65: uh yea so your gonna like have to get outta here before we call the ban police the secret police force created in 2008 to specifically enforce bans on business premises. 

MK: thats a real thing nic we should get outta here

Nic: but we have to hypnotize karl so we can find out what happened when he was abducted

MK: its fine i have a plan

2 hours later the three of us were standing in the airport in seattle. MK had booked us a flight.

Karl: you know i really didnt actually agree to get hypnotized and also why th efuck are we flying to bali to track down dr bernier i know shes the only hypnotherapist in seattle but the whole world too?

MK: yes karl remember in season 12 when we learnmed that section didnt want to try to bribe every single hypnotheripist in the world to get info on breach participants so they enacted a hypnotherapist purge that killed them all off except for dr. bernier?

Karl: uh i was probably drunk during that part 

Nic: yea i dont remember that at all either are you sure that happened MK?

MK: uh yea it definitely did. Come to think of it now actually I think you were high of fentynal and like acid or something at the time Nic so i dont blame you for not remembering.

Nic: oh ok that sounds plausible

MK: anyway i hacked into the single wifi router that all of bali collectively uses so i was able to pinpoint dr bernier’s exact position so now all we have to do is fly over there and force her to give karl hypnotherapy.

Nic: oh yes what a great plan

Karl: uh guys i dont know if i really wanna be hypnotized again i have some trauma associated with that and remember Nic i told you that shit can fuck you up

Nic: karl stop being such a pussy how else are we gonna find the truth about what happened to you after you were abducted by those aliens and how its connected to tanis?

Mk: yea karl stop complaining your finally relevent to the plot arent you happy?

Karl: PEER PRESSURE EMERGENCY Uh-Uh no no bibbity bop kazow i cant be pressured no way no how!

Nic: what if i buy you airport cinnabon and beer

Karl: ok im in

After eating overpriced cinnamon bites and shitty craft beer we made our way to the terminal and boarded our flight. I got stuck next to a crying baby that wouldnt shut up once on our entire 23 hour long flight. Mk was in first class. Im not sure how she managed that but im assuming she did some hacker nonsense to get that seat. My suspicions were seemingly confirmed when i overheard the flight attendatnts informing a very irate buisnessman that he had cancled his ticket that afternoon and that his seat was taken and he would not be allowed to board.

I listened to all 89 seasons of tanis on the way because i love hearing the sound of my own voice. Once when i had to go to the bathroom i thought that one of the other passengers was the man that veronika referred to as the Father but when i looked again it turned out to just be a rasputin body pillow that someone had purchased a seat ticket for and had propped up

Eveentually we finally arrived in bali. Where bali is i couldnt tell ya but sure as sure we were there. I left the airpot in a daze. MK seemed to be fine as she had seemingly had a spa day up there in first class and karl just got drunk and slept through the whole flight. We made our way to th ehotel and i passed out for exactly 6 and a half minutes before MK told me that our return flight was scheduled for tomorrow so we really didnt have any time to waste.

I contemplated jumping out of the hotel window but decided that would be too much of a boring way for Nicodemus Silver world famous radio podcast host to die so i sucked it up and pulled myslef out of bed.

Mk led us through a maze of alleyways and streets occasionally checking her phone to check ourr bearing. Eventually we found ourselves in front of mysterious non descript grey brick building woith no name, company logo, or any identifying features at all. 

Nic: your sure this is yhje right place MK?

MK: im offende d that you would ebenm ask that nic

Karl: so should we go inside?

MK: um obviously why do you think we came all this way?

We all huddled close and opened the front door of the building and stepped inside……

ADDDS OVER 

Before I tell you what we found in that warehouse im going to read you something that we found that is seemingly connected to TANIS. Its something i ddint realize was relevant until much later. Here it is.

OCT 23 1879: Dr williams, great news! The sample you provided is doing exceptionally well. It seems like the unique breach ecosystem you provided access to is doing wonders for the samples. Everything is preceding at a accelerated rate and we should have more news for you soon. 

November 16 1890: oh shit oh fuck guys this shits goin bad frfr like we are FUCCCCCKKKEEDDDDDD its like making fucking skinwalker clones of us we should have never tried to control it all of humanity is dooooooommmeeedddd

Novenmvber 19 1870: dawg we chillin dont worry about it we defo arent all infected woith tanis juice come let us out og this containment facility

It was at this point that i got bored with writing this specific document so i actually found a different one to read, but this time i got my friend and producing partner Alex Reagan to read it and i know how much you all love HER YOU WONT SHUT UP ABOUT BLACK TAPES SEASON 3 PART 2 OR BLACK TAOES SEASON 4 like SHUT UP ALEX HAD TO GO FIGHT THE CENOPHUS WITH DOCTOR STRAND THEY ARE RAIDIO SILENT TO STAY UNDERCOVER but also she still reads shit 4 me so here it is

Alex reagan: from the notes of professor john corroman circa 1456 ad.

Today i saw a bird. It was a very pretty bird. It was a yellow bird. What a great bird.

Day 2: today i saw anothe bird! Its crazy i know. 2 birds in 2 days what are the odss! This time it was a blue bird. Very pretty bird.

Day 3: today i saw a red bird! Magnificent. What an amazing location for bird watching this place is

Day 4: today i saw a black bird. It went GAWAW GAWAW it was verey cute.

Day 5: today i saw a eldritch demon fromk the underside of reality. It ripped away my sanity ans soul from my body and left me as a husk of my former self

Day 6: today i saw a white bird! Truly mafgnificent!

Day 7: I saw another red bird tos=day uwu it wasvery cute\\

Day 8: today i fell down a hole in the ground and ended up in some kinda parallel dimension like a nightmare world identical to our own but slightly off somehow. Luckality i remembered that all i needed to do was find an elevator on a buildinmb that had at leat 10 floors and then play the elevaTOR game in reverse to escape, which i did just that and now im back

Day9: today i saw a beautiful yellowish grey bird! Very good bird.

Day 10: OH GOD OH GOD MY FLESH SINEW AND VERY BEING ARE BEING RIPPED AND SHREDDED FROM THIS WORLD OH AHH THE AGONY OG GOD SOMEONE PLEASE KILL ME OH GOD OF GOD OH GOD 

Day 11: today i saw a purple bird :3 I didnt even know they came in that color!

Day 12: NIC SILVER I AM TALKING TO YOU DIRECTLY FROM THE PAST. YOU ARE THE NAVIGATOR AND YOU NEED TO GO BACK INTO TANIS OR ALL OF HUMAITY IS FUCKED

So you can see why i had a feeling that this stuff was relevant somehow. It felt to pertinent, too exact to be coincidental. But it had to be a coincidence, didnt it? I mean I wasnt even alive in 1545 so how could john corroman know to leave me a message? Mk did some digging.

Mk: ok so it turners out there were actually like 13 different guys all names nic silver back in 1342 so really he could have bneen referring to any of them.

Nic: wait there are a bunch of people with myh name i thought it was a very unique name

Mk: yea so apppenently there was a secret order of watchers dedicated to keeping tanis safe and wnen you join you must take of the name of NIC SILVER TANIS GUARDIAN

Nic: thats crazy 

MK: you havent even heard the good part

Nic: and whats that

MK: i ran a dna test on you, and turners out your actually a direct decendent of th eanchient nicodemus silver tanis cult.\\

Nic: holy shit how did i never know about this

MK: maybe you did know and you just didnt realize it

N8ic: oh i guess that explains why both my parents were also named nic silver and were always actively feeding me drugs and letting me get kidnapped by priests in training so that i could awaken my tanis communication powers.

MK: yea in hindsight we really should have known something was up with you

So now we knew that my family had been connected to TANIS. What else about my past was being hidden from me? How closely tied was I was TANIS that I still didnt know?

I decided that in order to find out i would have to confront my mother, which would be tricky considering she had been dead for 15 years. Luckaly i knew someone who could help. Someone id only met relatively recently.

Phone ringing sound

Female voice: Hello Nina Sharp speaking how did you get this number

Nic: Its me I need a favor

TANIS BOOM

Before I tell you what i learned from Nina sharp, lets get back to what happened when me, MK and Karl entered that building in Bali.

We stepped inside that building not knowing what to expect, but a complestly empty abandoned warehouse was certintly not it. 

Nic: Its empty, it must be the wrong place

MK: no my tracker says shes here, look back there

Karl ans I both looked to the back of the warehouse where MK was pointing. She was right, at the far end of the warehouse i could see a door with a faint light coming from underneath.

Silently we all moved towards the back of the building. Karl did some cool flips and rolls like he was in a spy movie. MK just rolled her eyes.

When we were close enough I peaked through the window on th edoor to see what i could see

Inside the room i saw dr bernier standing in front of a person who was strapped down to a table with restraints. It was a person I recognized. It was Veronika Pillman.

Nic: She has veronika we have to save her

Karl: way ahead of you buddy 

Karl busted down the dior and the three of us stormed in

Dr:Bernier: holy shit what the fuck why are you here Nic?!?!?! What the hell? 

Nic: What are you doing with Veron9ika

Bernier: Uh im doing secret new hypnotherapy techniques on her wtf why are you here seriously

Nic: well im here to save veronika from you ive been having psychic dreams where she tells me to save her and now i finally found her\\

Karl: yea also i need you to hypnotize me so i can do regression therapy and rememver whgat hwppwned to me when i was abducted by aliens

Bernier: oh shit aliens??!?! Well why didngt you just say so

At this point doctor bernier unstrapped veronikas unconscious body and shoved her off th etable where she collapsed in a crumple dpile on the floor.

Bernier: ok dude get up here imma bout to hypnotize you so fucking good but theres one thing i need……

Karl: wjagt is it

Bernier: Im gonna need Nic here to act as a psychic resonance terminal to connect to your brainwaves and relay the info cuz of bullshit tanis reasons or saomething also nic is the main character so hes legally required to be important all the time

Karlk: ok sounds reasonable

Nic: yea sounds reasonable

Mk: is no one concerned about unconscious veronika on the floor?

Bernier and Nic and Karl all simultaniously: Shut up Mk we are about to do psychic hypnosis therapy 

Mk: jesus christ that was terrifying i guess ill just sit this one out

At this point dr bernier strapped karl and i down and placed a strange helment on out head s with a long tube connecting tyhem,\\\\

Bernier: this is yjhe only way for us to find out the truth about the aliens that abducted you karl. Nic wiull be phycically connected to you in order to experience your memories from the first person and be able to relay them back to us

Karl: ok hit it

Bernier hits karl with an enourams comically large inflatable hammerknocking him out instantly

As soon as karl passed out a flood of images stared appearing in my mind.

I was there, inside karls memory. I was laying strapped to a table inside of a stange room. It was large and round and filled with stange organic looking machinery. I saw creatures unlike anything id ever seen before wandering around the room but when i focused i could see someone else…. Someone in the back of the room…… someone id only ever seen on television screens…….. someone whos name might sound very familiar to some of those listening depending on how well you know celebrities…………. It was …………..none other than………….the one and only…………………………………WILL SMITH

TANIS BOOM

Yes thats right famous actor william smitheron jr the third the 2nd th eseniour juioniur the 3rd 4th quatraine limit breaker king of france himself bill gates john smith francis william smithsoniam the 18th von carlstein omega res novae enternatus carolina reaper hell gate brian himself was there in that very UFO.

TANIS BOOM 

But it wasnt just any will smith….. It was men in black will smith…… but….. This didnt make any sense! William sitherson was always opposed to the aliens in this classic films….. How could he be now working WITH the aliens?????? Something didnt feel right…….

Suddenly I felt the BLUR start up and suddenly i was floating above Karl. Somehow the blur was allowing me to astral project back in time within karls hypnosis memory regression and see things that even he wasnt aware of. This was all the evidence I needed that this event was somehow connected to the mysterious and ancient legendary myth of TANIS.

I floated over to willllllllllllerm the smith and looked hi in the eyes, to my astonishment he turned to face me and looked me back in the eyes. \\\\\\

Will smith: Nic Silver…. I knew you would come here. I needed to speak with you so I manipulated these aliens into retroactivy kidnapping your best friend karl van sant before he even knew you so that now in 2077 when this season of tanis takes place, you would be able to come back here to speak with me through karls active living memtic memory of this event. You see i am me but at the same time i am not me. The me you see before you is the me that i desperately wished to speak with you at that time and was reflected into the consciousness of Karl through the morphogenetic field. He carried that version of me that i had carefully curated for this moment for his whole life, tucked within the fields of his subconscious until at this very moment that i in the future present past had foreseen and already experienced knew that the 14th casual race of anti-life humanity seed-purge carrier entity transport vessals would be sent to exterminate you three on this day in order to prevent you from coming into contact with the Elder SaipioGenesis Construct and ascending you to your final awakening withing the 4d plane that we have scaled our manipulation efforts to. They could not allow the seed beerer dna within you to awaken and begin the unraveling of the heavens. Within that rite would see the undoing of all pre established godheads and all previous “Alpha” and “omeaga” entities. Thus these Harbingers or emmesairues of The ones who feed could not allow you, the navigator ie godhead annihilation entity to reach its final mutation state within the ritual of TANIS. This is the reason for your very existence. I sent my seeded partial consciousness here to this place within karl from th epast to warn you about this very imp-

Before will could ramble anymore like some kind of schizophrenic nutcase a giant explosion rocked the entire ship. A hole was blown in the side and i could suddenly see out into the void of the endless cosmos. I could also see the thing that had created that explosion. It was an enourmas mecanical huminoid creature. It had attached itself to the side of the ship and blown it open, the mech reached its hand out to me

Mech: Nic Silver, come with me if you want to live

At this point will smitherson the 3rd pulled out an automatic rifle and aimed it at me

Will: dont you dare go with them nicodemus this is too important to let you fuck up

Mech: NIC! Get over here NOW this is the only way to learn the truth about TAnis, your parents and what really happened to Alex Reagan

What really happened to alex. That was enticing info. Last time I had heard from alex was wehen she mad mailed me a post card from the UK 3 years ago. I hadabt heard from here since and had no idea what she and dr strand had even been up too. 

Mech: NIC the black tapes, tanis, the last movie, rabbits, faerie….. Thety are all connected. You have to trust me, come with me i can answer all your questions

That was a big promise. How could I turn something like that down? Well if youve learned anything about me by now you know, I couldnt. 

Without thinking i ran towards the mechs open hand as will smithonian oart 2 electric boogaloo opened fitre on me

Luckality he was just absolutely the worst at shooting cuz he missed all his shots and i lept into the mechas hand which closed around me shielding me from harm as i fekt it leap off the ship and begin flying away

I got really bored of waiting to land so i took a lil nappy nap and then nwe were there.

I disembarked and looked around at my surroundings. What i saw shocked and confused me. 

I was inside the highest penthpouse suit of tilted towers famous landing spot from hit game fortnite. In front of me was someone i never thought i would meet in real life

It was memphis tennessee the hedgehog from hit sega video game franchise sonic T. Hedgehog game sonic aught 6. 

Memphis tennessee: Nicodemus silver! Welcome to my gamer pad. We are going to get so tilted at the towers

Nic: i dont understand whats happening here

Menphilioma: its ok no one does. This is all still technically happening in karl van sants subconscious, or should i say GEOFF van sant…. Thats right geoff and karl switch names not once……… but TWICE!! Thereby nullifying their switch to beijing with! A double blind duel agent ultra switcheroo that no one would ever see coming.

Nic: ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………

Memphis: i see you have been left speechless sby my amazing info

Nic: (but its actually terry ): no im just surprised you managed to think of an even dumber and more useless plot twist than me

Methophillioma: haHA yes now you SEE we are getting so TILTED at the TOWERS………….speaking of wich why dont you introduce yourself….. Eva mk.9 piolet

The huge mechs head and neck split open as a large cynynder rotate dout from the openmingb and splty open. Emerging from the cockpit was a man with a long ripped red coat and long white hair and a cool looking sword strapped to his back

Man: hey there Nic, im Dante from teh Devil may cry series. But you can call me derrick

Nic: why would i call you derrick

Dante: idk i just always wante dto be called that

Nic: but dante is like the 2nd coolest name after nic silver why would you wanty to be called something else

Dante: have you ever thought that maybe i didngt want a cool protagonist name huh nbic??? Did you ever think that some of us might not LIKE BEING MAIN CHARACHTERS HUH NIC???? Maybe the PRESSURE IS TO OMUCH ANS I JUST HAVE TO HAVE A NORMAL LIFE WHERE IK DONT HAVE TO KILL DEMONS ALL THE FUCKIN TIME AND I CAN JUST GO TO STARBUCKS ANS ORDER A ICED MOCHA FRAPACHINNO WITH CHARAMEL DRIZZKE FOR DERRICK HUH DID YOU EVER  THINK ABOUT THAT???????

Nic: ok jesus im sorry ill call you derrick

Derrick: thank you

Meshisness: ok now back to me please i very much wantgto be the fucus here becaus eim obviously the most important person here\]\]\\\\\\\\

Nic: I take offense tio that 

Menthis: well ill fight you for the role of main charachter in tanis then

Nic: ok your on no one can out special tanis boy tmtmtmtm me nicodemus silver

Before memphis the hedgepig could do anything i lunged at him wit the rabied ferocity of a sleep deprived podcast host and conduit to ancient entities beyond mortal comprehension. I shoved my thumbs directly into his one big weird sonic the hedgehog conjolined eyeball. He started screaming in agony when suddenly i was thrown off of him by derrick. 

Derrick: hey hwat the fuck man 

Nic: he tried to threaten my main character status this cannot be tolerated i am super special tanis boy tmtmtmtm and NO ONE ELSE IS ALLOWED

Derrick: well muchaca the hedgehog is my best friend in the entire world so i wonmt let you pop his uni eye thats where he gets all his future sight prophecy power

Nic: just tryu and stop me

I lunged forward towards derrick in a blinding flash of speed. Before i could make impact however, derrick sidesteped me and swunfg down towards me with his demon soul blade. 

I instant transmissioned out of the way and telepoted behind him, summoning my own weapon, a blade made of pure TANIS energy. I stabbed forwards intop derricks back but at the last second i felt my blade be deflected and i saw a blinding flash of red

I flew back, but managed to flip myself upright and land, skidding back along the floor. Someone new now stood between me and derrick

K. knuckles T. Echidna: Kept ya waiting huh

Welcome back to season 3 of the the Black tapes podcast, im alex reagen. This season we continue our exploration into the mysterious and enigmatic founder of the strand institute doctor richard strand and his collection of stange cases refereed to as the black tapes.

I know I left you on quite a cliff hanger at the end of our mid season break, I had just revealed that along with strands tickets for us to go to geneva, which we had determined to be the true axis mundi and the location which the ordrer of the cenophus and thomas warren of Daeva corporation had been leading us to all along. Not only that but it turns out that howard strand, richard strands father might be alive. Or my alternative tickets to an undisclosed location where i had proposed strand and i just simply run away and leave everything behind so as to not further endanger ourselves and others in this story that had become far more than either us us had anticipated?

Well Im happy to tell you that because your hearing this episode, we didnt decide to run. I had you a promise, that as long as you all would keep listening that I would keep digging deeper until I discovered the full truth at the heart of the black tapes, the conophus, the mysterium, and the unsound. 

Strand and i knew the chances of howard and cora lee both being held captive by thomas warren in geneva were slim and that it was most lickly just a ploy to get us out there, but the cenophus was wasting their time. Strand and I were already in too deep. We were going and nothing was going to stop us.

\*airport noises\*

Strands fucking sexy ass sultry voice\~\~: Alex, are you sure about this? Its going to be dangerous and we can still-

Alex: richard really? After everything we’ve been through these past three years, after everything weve uncovered about your family and your past, th efact that cora lee is still alive and maybe even your father and yet still you think we have the luxury of backing out?

Strand: We always have a choice alex

Alex: and my choice was made the minute i realized that there was more going on with these black tapes than we originally thought. Im seeing this through, to the end.

At this point strands eyes softened. He appeared to relax slightly as he heard my resolve.

Strand: Im glad you feel the same way as i do alex, i just had to make sure. I dont want to put you in a dangerous situation just because you feel obligated to help me

Alex: Richard I care about you, and i care about finding the truth. Dangerous situation or not we can and will make it through this. Im not going to let you go face thomas warren, the man who destroyed your family and has been stalking you all these years, without backup.

Strand: alex I dont know what to say. I know weve had our disagreements and fights but im glad that I met you, and im glad that your the one standing here by my side.

Alex: im glad i met you too richard. Now its almost time to board our flight. Lets go put an end to this.

We made our way through the crowded seattle airpot towards our terminal. As I walked through the crowds of people I couldnt help but think about everything taht had happened over these past three years. What had started as a seemingly simple podcast episode about the paranormal hobby of ghost hunting had spiraled into a web of complex conspiracy filled with a vast world wide spanning cult, real death, and seemingly real demons. 

Everything strand and I had been working towards had finally led us here, headed to Geneva, the eye of the storm. The place thomas warren had apparently been secretly using as a lab to bring some kind of shadow entity into our reality in order to bring to fruition his ancient order’s goal of ushering in a new age of destruction and rebirth with a race of shadow’s stepping forth from shadow as this worlds new masters. 

It sounded insane, but even if their supernatural beliefs were not actually true, we had found real eviedenve of a very desiccated and orginized network of people doing very harmful subliminal and hypnosis techniques to very young children and criminally insane mental instritution paitents. 

The order of the cenophus itself was real and it needed to be bright to light and stopped, and if there was something strand and i could do to help then we would do everything we could.

Strand of course had his own personal reasons, and i too had become invested in strands past and the truth about what his father had been preparing him for. There were stil lso many unanswered questions about howard strand and his relationship to thomas warren as well as cora lee and her anchient order of watchers. 

As we strode through the airport, all these thoughts racing through my head i fekt a sense of finality, like this trip would be the one that would finally reval everything , put every puzzle piece in place, put three years of searxching into perspective and make everything click.

If only I had known then what i know now.

I GASPED WHEEZING FOR BREATH AS I SAT Bolt upright on the table. In front of me lay karl, and between us stood berinier.

Nic: og jesus christ thank god im back i think i accidentally travened to a universe where the black tapes actually continued whew i sure im glad we avoided that 

Beriner: Nic did you learn the truth of the aliens?

Nic: uh no tbh i think i just was extremely high and had a crazy ass trip
