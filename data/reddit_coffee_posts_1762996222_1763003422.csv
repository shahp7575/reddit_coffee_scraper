For context, I’m 43F, married w kids, have been unfaithful but only through AM meets (and it’s been a couple years). I don’t have many organic opportunities to converse w men one-on-one as I work from home as an artist. 

Anyway, at cafe I hear - “that’s a great book you’re reading” (a pretty trendy, self help book in the creative sector). And we get to talking for like fifteen minutes! About being creatives, the challenges, our interests. Im blushing, I’m like, is this actually happening? He can tell he’s talking to a married mom with some sagging skin, right? And eventually he suggests I attend his upcoming gig this weekend, and I’m like “oh well, that would be hard to get away from my family… maybe I could bring my creative 10 yo son “ (inject record scratch here ahhh).

He was like “well… it can get pretty raunchy at times”..

Honestly a good sport, as he kept talking to me for another five min or so before eventually breaking it off to get in line for food.

I’ve found him on Instagram and am tempted to dm something along the lines of “such a delight to connect over [book] .. you made this middle aged lady’s day today!”

Lame? Should I let it go and enjoy the bliss of a random encounter? Or is a shot not taken a shot missed?

And - guys, would you go up and make small talk w a random female at a coffee shop and mention your upcoming gig if you didn’t want something kind of more? Or am I just a desperate cougar? 

TLDR - a young guy chatted me up at a coffee shop, should I dm him after sussing out his insta? ",1,1763002793.0,adultery,0,1.0,False

I made some milk coffee with cothas coffee beans(4 months old) and it tasted wayyy better than the bru that I was used to but when I brew some black coffee with those beans, man it was pretty bad. A few days ago I grinded the beans in a mixer grinder and that tasted awful black and with milk , this time milk coffee tastes decent but now when I brewed it black( with quite a course grind ) it still tasted bad , way better than before but there was still a harsh bitter aftertaste.
Help me find what should I change , is it the rubosta beans my cothas blend has , is it because the coffee is stale , is it my brewing method ( 15g coffee bloom for 1 min with 80ml and then pour to 250 and steep for 2 mins ) or the grind setting. 
Also I wanted some recommendations for some affordable coffee beans for milk coffee , I made my family quit instant , currently considering hunkal.

We went out for coffee once and after that when I asked him out again he simply said ""for what?"" After that day he started ghosting me irl.

I feel like I did something wrong by thinking he might be interested in friendship or more. So I feel like I'd need to apologize to him for coming off the wrong way and to make clear that I see there's some kind of unease.

1ovpwou,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ovpwou,Snack pack part 4 - The Main Event,"Really late dinner was the bread and spaghetti main. Yes I heated it up. Maybe one day I'll caveman it like JermsMRE 🤣. I squeezed a bit on the bread to make some spaghetti sandwiches and added some of the picante powder to those and the rest into the main. 

The bread. It's MRE bread that is a split whole wheat. It's actually pretty good for a vacuum sealed product. It still has that funky chemical aftertaste but I can look passed it. It might be the oxygen absorber or maybe the package is nitrogen flushed? Anyway it has a wholesome feeling with a sweet background flavor like a good whole wheat bread. 8/10 for me and I'd eat it again.

The picante powder is a dehydrated hot sauce with added paprika, chili powder and spices. It doesn't make it taste like a bowl of chili but gave it a needed kick. This is delicious and a better option than Tabasco. Yes I said what I said until there is a Tabasco powder. It should be standard issue in every ration just like Bill's brew. I don't give a shit that the kids don't drink coffee anymore. They're stupid, big, fat doo-doo heads anyway. 8.5/10 but only because it's not Tabasco, Crystal or Louisiana brand hot sauces. 

Finally the spaghetti with beef and sauce. It's very saucy and the pasta is basically mush after heating but besides that it's a pretty amazing main. This was my first time having the wet version so my expectations were low. There's a lesson there kids. Keep your expectations low and you'll always be surprised. The sauce has a wonderful tomato flavor and a beefy punch. It might be on the saucy side so it's easier to eat through the package because that was easy to squeeze right in my mouth hole. With the picante sauce added it was kicked up to notches unknown. I believe this was maybe the best part of the whole ration and I give it a 9/10. It needed more meat and maybe a bit more pasta. 

Overall the CCAR menu 1 is a hodge podge of shit they pulled of the shelf and threw together to get something out to the troops. Does that mean it bad? Certainly not. Does that mean it can be better? Certainly yes. It's a decent first attempt and I hope that they do better for our troops in the future. Seriously add some more drinks to this. The protein shake isn't enough. If the children not drinking coffee anymore is the reason for it's discontinuation them make a powdered beverage that mirrors energy drinks. To have to rely on a pack of gum for caffeine is a bit strange. My overall score is 7/10 for the reasons above. Maybe another main instead of so many snacks and an FRH would go a long way to making this better. Cold chow is edible chow but hot chow is a godsend. 

Until next time, be safe and be kind. ",2,1763002672.0,MRE,0,1.0,False
1ovpvk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ovpvk7/how_i_get_a_genuine_job_offer_every_12_weeks/,How I get a genuine job offer every 1-2 weeks,"1. I manage and host events for my community of startup founders I've met in-person
2. I put myself out there on social media everyday: mostly TikTok, some LinkedIn/Reddit

I'm not saying this is advice you should take, but this is how I get the 100k-200k remote SWE jobs I receive weekly/bi-weekly. 



Some background:  
I graduated from UCONN in 2024 with an econ degree. Moved to Austin that summer to go all-in on building a startup, but lost all my savings in 8 months and had to mow lawns, walk dogs, and be a mover for some time. In April I got lucky with a job as a stand-in CTO for a health tech company through friends. (I have 10 YOE coding)



During my first 8 months in Austin I would go to coworking spaces or coffee shops to work. Overtime I naturally got to know the people who consistently went there: when I had to share tables with someone because the shop was full, or when I would be standing in a long line and ask what people thought about the coffee. 



Within a week, I had introduced my first friends to each other and kickstarted my community. Every week I scheduled weekly co-working meetups when my friends and I would meet up to work and keep each other accountable.

  
When I meet someone who is also a founder I connect them with another who they might find interesting. It's nice to be nice, and doing this also helps people want to stick around me. My general founder network is around \~500, with \~300 I've met in-person. Sometimes these founders ask me if I know anyone with a SWE background that could join their company. These jobs offers range from around $20/hr to $200k/year. (By the way, I've only been asked for sales, SWE, or sound/graphic design roles).

People within the community also refer someone fit for the job, and the bond between members grow.



I document my life every day on TikTok. I don't get many people offering me jobs on TikTok unless it's clear I'm looking for one. When I post on Reddit or LinkedIn about a milestone I've crossed I usually get at least 4-5 offers. I post for fun, to let my general network know how I'm doing, or because I think I can help people with something without much work



Not sure if reading this helped you, but this has been my experience. I hope I did not come off as arrogant. Generally I think something everyone can apply is to try to provide value to people around you. It does not have need to be a professional connection. You could say good morning, or open doors for people, just get comfortable talking to people and being pleasant to be around; this is how you get lucky.",1,1763002581.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

July.07

Three years ago, Julia and I became husband and wife. Today, we looked back on that glorious day and celebrated under the stars. It was the perfect evening.



July.29

Finished painting the hallway. Just the kitchen left. Julia's father came by for a visit. Offered to help, but it was already late in the day and we wanted to move on.

Had coffee and talked about the new house. Told George that he could help us with the kitchen next week.



Aug.13

Took awhile, but this place looks good as new, or close to it. Floorboards still creak and Julia thinks the basement's haunted, but she probably just hears the pipes. Old plumbing in places like this. Might renovate next year, but for now; home sweet home.



Sept.03

Julia's pregnant! I'm going to be a dad!



Sept.09

I feel so grateful for all I have. Today, I just thought about all the years leading up to this. All those years of med school so I could get a good job. Meeting Julia and all the awkward little moments that brought us together. The long shifts at the hospital that helped me afford this house. The weeks of renovations until it finally felt like home. Now, I'm thinking of the months ahead, preparing to share this home with a tiny little version of ourselves. Our first of hopefully many. Everything is perfect.



Sept.12

Girl scout came to our door. Didn't think scouts were still a thing. Also didn't think anyone would walk up our driveway considering the length of it. She earned the money for her efforts and I earned these mint chocolate delights.



Sept.20

Julia nearly gave me a heart attack. She was walking down the basement steps when a board near the bottom gave way. She fell, but thankfully, it wasn't as bad as it could have been.

I asked her why she went down there, since I just use it to store empty boxes and tools.



She said; ""I thought I heard something. Someone talking down there.""



I fixed the broken board and searched the basement. My guess is the wind blew through the furnace and made a sound. Something like that.



Oct.04

I lost a patient today. It was a risky procedure. He knew that when he agreed to it. In the end, I can only do so much. I'm not God.



Oct.17

Been a rough few weeks. Haven't slept the best. Julia has been a great comfort.



I told her; ""What if it happens, again?""



She said; ""If it does, we'll deal with it. You're the best surgeon they have, but even you can't save everyone.""



She's right. I need to let it go.



Oct.31

Surprisingly, we had twelve trick or treaters. One of which was the girl scout from awhile back. Almost didn't recognize her. She was dressed as a nurse. If Julia had dressed as a girl scout, that would have been hilarious.



Nov.01

Early this morning, probably two or three, I got up to use the bathroom. I noticed the door to the basement was open. It was cold, so I checked the wood furnace. It was down to embers. I threw some sticks in and stirred the embers around.



From behind me I was sure I heard a faint whisper, like someone saying; ""What are you doing?""



When I turned around, there was no one there.



Nov.10

The hospital was insane today. Julia told me a patient nearly got violent with her. He was shouting and cursing, flailing his arms like a lunatic. A forty year old gorilla that ought to be sedated. If I had been there I would've carved out his heart and fed it to him.



Nov.14

The gorilla caused a scene today and this time, I was there to see it. He threatened several of the staff and punched a hole in the wall. Two of the male nurses and I got him back to his room peacefully, but inside my blood was boiling. We try to help these people and yet, they're so ungrateful.



Dec.06

Bought a new table at auction. It's long and sturdy. Perfect for sorting my tools. Burned some empty boxes that were just cluttering up the place. The basement is tidy now. More room to store wood for the winter.



Dec.25

Christmas was great this year. George bought us a crib. Tomorrow, I'll assemble it in the guest room, or what will soon be the nursery. Some baby clothes came in from my parents. I think they want me to reconnect with them, but I'm not ready. Perhaps having a grandchild will change them somehow, but I don't think it will. I sent them a Christmas card this year. That's enough for now.



Julia liked the quilt I bought her. She was so-so on the vacuum cleaner.



Jan.01

My new year's resolution is to improve my resolve.



Jan.16

We went skating today. First time in years. It was peaceful. Life is good.



Feb.02

Julia called in sick, today. Between the gloomy weather and the pregnancy, her immune system had to fail eventually. George kept her company while I was working. I always liked George. I hope to be a father like him one day. A respectable man.



Feb.12

It's a boy! The ultrasound revealed what I knew all along. I'm thinking of naming him, Roger.



The doctor said Julia's dizzy spells are common. The baby is taking up a lot of her body's resources. He said she'll get used to it soon enough.



Feb.17

I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of creaking steps. My bed was empty.



I called out; ""Julia?""



I went down stairs to look for her and saw that the basement door was ajar. Turning on the light, I descended the creaking steps. She was standing in front of the wood furnace with the furnace door wide open. She just stood there, staring in to the flame.



I placed my hand on her shoulder. ""Julia. Come back to bed.""



She slowly turned to face me. Her head slumped forward, as if too heavy for her neck. I raised her head with my hand. She was feverishly hot and sweating. Her eyes stared blankly through me, as if in a trance.



I asked her why she was down there. She just stared in to space and said, ""What are you doing?""



She collapsed in my arms and I carried her upstairs. I've never been so afraid.



Feb.18

Julia's been in bed all day. The hospital approved her maternity leave, so at least she doesn't have to worry about work. She can rest quietly.



Mar.03

It's been a rough couple of weeks. Julia's been staying home most days, only going out for groceries if George or myself accompanies her. She's been maintaining good spirits and understands that these things are common to all pregnancies. I'm a little worried that her circumstances are more severe than most, but that may only be my opinion because it's happening to the woman I love and not to some random patient.



She told me, ""You worry too much. I'm fine. The baby's fine. In a few months, we'll look back and laugh at this.""



Her optimism is one of the reasons I married her. She's right. We'll get through this.



Mar.14

George and I had an argument, today. For the first time in recent memory, he doubted my ability to provide for his daughter. He didn't put it that way, but I knew what he meant.



He said, ""I think it would be a good idea if Julia stayed with me for a little while. At least until she's feeling better.""



When I asked him how that would help, he replied; ""Julia might feel more comfortable back at the house. She grew up there. It's familiar to her. She told me that, since moving in here, she feels a bit, off.""



I was quite surprised to hear this and thought that George might be lying. That he was seeing the stress in my face and thinking that I wasn't well enough to take care of her, myself. It had nothing to do with the house. The house was perfect.



My disagreement with George lead to him playing the, ""She's my daughter"" card. While I countered with the ""She's my wife and carrying my son"" card. Our voices rose but only for a moment as neither of us wanted to wake Julia.



I apologized for my behavior and before he left, I told George that I would think about it. Even though, there's nothing to think about. I'm completely capable of caring for her myself.



Mar.20

The doctor said that the baby is draining too much, too quickly and that Julia's body can't sustain it. Roger has quite the appetite, it seems.



They have several tubes, flowing with nutrient-rich fluids, connected to Julia. The machines provide hope, but the look on the doctor's face made me feel uneasy. I must remember not to worry. It upsets Julia.



Apr.01

Roger is dead and God is laughing. Fool's day, indeed.



May.02

I haven't been feeling well. Julia hasn't recovered from the shock of losing our boy. Spending most of her time in bed either sleeping or watching old family sitcoms on tv.



She's perpetually cold. I set up a makeshift room in the basement so she can be close to the furnace. She was happy with this. The sound doesn't seem to bother her.



Another reason for the move, she was walking to the basement, anyway. Several nights after Roger passed, Julia would shamble down the creaky steps and try to warm herself by the furnace. I got so worried. I feared that one of these nights, she'd suffer a fall. I put her down there to keep her safe. She will be safe.



May.08

Julia's breathing has become heavy and forceful. She was never a smoker. If anything her lungs were one of her finer qualities. Oh, how she used to sing. We would run or hike and she would never get tired. Now, she's begun to struggle for each breath.



At night, I sit beside her bed and we have our little chats. She can barely say a word, but she tries. I've taken to making observations about whatever comedy or romance she's watching and she'll either nod or shake her head. This is the extent of our conversations.



May.13

The hospital has allowed me to borrow an old ventilator to help with Julia's breathing. It's old, but it works.



May.22

I've had several of my peers examine her, but none of them can figure out why Julia is still wasting away. It's as though her body is simply giving up. Like a soldier that's just tired of fighting. Looking for a place to fall and be buried.



I can't let that happen.



June.03

Despite what my peers may have thought, the surgery was a success. I told them, I only required the equipment and I could do the work myself. They wouldn't need to expend additional man power or take up another sick bed. A steady hand and some patience, that's all you need.



The feeding tube is attached. She won't be coughing up anything else. She needs every bit of nutrition and I'll ensure she gets it. What kind of husband would I be if I couldn't at least keep her fed?



June.05

George keeps knocking. I can hear him upstairs. He wants to take Julia away, I just know it. I'll protect her from him. I'll keep her safe.



June.06

We stayed up late telling ghost stories. I could tell she was scared, but I told her; ""They're just stories.""



I left the furnace open. As we stared together at the flames, I could hear the sound of the ventilator pump and the slow, steady beating of her heart monitor. Then, I heard her voice;



""There once was a witch in white linen, who desired to be seen.

Her husband was a butcher. He was jealous, cruel and mean.

She bewitched a simple sailor, who brought her to his bed.

The butcher cut their throats and turned the linen red.

The butcher burned the bodies, of the sailor and the whore.

Smoke rose up the chimney and the witch was seen no more.""



When I looked back at Julia, she had fallen asleep. I'm grateful for moments like this.



June.10

I fear I've done all I can. She's begun to retain fluid in her legs and feet. I found blood flowing through her urinary tube. Her kidneys are failing. There's nothing I can do about it. Julia knows I'd cut out my own kidneys if I could.



Every day, I try so hard to keep her happy. To make sure she's fed and clothed. Washed and clean. That she's alive. I've come so far. I can't lose her now. She could still make a recovery, she just needs time.



June.14

George woke me up this morning. Banging on the front door again and again. After I spent countless hours trying to heal his daughter. Now, he's trying to rob me of my sleep.



The next time he knocks, I think I might have to let him in.



June.15 

The table is set. We are ready for company.



June.20

I write this, knowing that at some point a line was crossed. Unfortunately, it is not a line that I can come back from.



George came knocking and I answered. He was load. A tad rude, to be honest. He demanded to see Julia, so I showed him. I walked him to the basement steps and he raced down to her bed.



When he saw her, I could tell that he was not prepared to witness what she had become. He was flustered, to say the least.



When George pointed to the various tubes and machines, I could tell he did not approve. I insisted that she was being taken care of but he refused to listen. He began to run up the stairs toward me. In self defense, I resisted. George lost his footing on a creaking step and fell backward. The back of his skull cracked against the cold, unforgiving concrete.



George was dead, but I did not kill him. That was his fault. Let me make that perfectly clear. I DID NOT kill George.



That said, I'm not one to let any opportunity go to waste. I know that all George really wanted was to help his daughter. I checked his I.D. and George was a registered donor.



It all worked out in the end. Another successful surgery.



June.23

I can't keep this up forever and I won't. This has gone on long enough.



To whoever finds this diary, please know that I never meant for things to end like this. I had so many plans. So many things I wanted to accomplish, but only if I could do them with her. I truly do love her. Even with the machines. They've become part of her, now. Just like George.



Please note that the pills I've taken should do no harm to my other organs. Only my heart will be damaged beyond repair. I, hereby, donate all other organs and tissue to keep Julia alive.  In my hand, you'll find a list of which organs I think Julia requires.



May you do everything possible to keep her safe.



May God have mercy on my soul.

1ovpvfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1ovpvfi/looking_for_feedback_on_a_5andabit_course/,Looking for feedback on a 5-and-a-bit course Thanksgiving dinner menu,"I've never made a multi-course meal by myself before and frankly in general I would consider myself a fairly novice cook, but I want to host a Thanksgiving dinner with (4 or 5) friends just for a bit of fun. Only one of us actually grew up celebrating Thanksgiving, so I felt I could take some creative liberties with the meal and decided to go for somewhat fancy vibes with mostly native New England autumn ingredients for the main flavors of each course and apple elements to tie them all together. I mostly settled on the number of courses just by coming up with components I wanted in the meal; I realize it does seem like a lot for a novice, but a lot of it fairly turned-off-brain-able (the amuse-bouche, the entree, the salad, the dessert), though I'm open to simplifying it. Regardless, since I have total control over the meal, I'd like some feedback from more experienced cooks to make sure it's as good as it can possibly be. Here is the menu:

**0. Amuse-bouche: Goat cheese, apple compote, and maple syrup tartlets**

**1. Soup: Creamy mussel soup with apple cider and lardons**  
Would it be odd to use apple cider instead of wine to steam the mussels? Also, one member of the group is vegetarian. I'm making carrot lox for his appetizer and an oyster mushroom steak for his main, but I can't think of a good alternative for the soup. I'm open to changing it entirely if the consensus seems to be that this, the appetizer, and the main consecutively would be too much, though I couldn't think of any good alternative. I did consider that something like a squash soup would fit the theme very well, and mushroom soup would also work well, but unfortunately I despise all squashes/gourds in all forms and my partner generally dislikes mushrooms (which, by the way, is criminal) so I don't think either would work...

**2. Entree: Smoked salmon verrines with crushed crackers, cream cheese, and apples**  
Is this an okay combination? Is there anything I should add or remove?

**3. Main: Pan-seared duck breast with plum gastrique and pommes fondant**  
(Duck because I don't love turkey, and duck is technically more accurate anyways, not that we're really going for historical accuracy here.) This is definitely a spot where I'm stuck. I think I need to add something else here, something either bright or acidic, maybe a bit crispy, and preferably colorful to contrast with the other elements, but I just can't think of anything! Also, I chose plum gastrique because I (clearly!) favor fruits, and plum seemed to fit the theme better than options like orange or cherry, but I'm still concerned that it's out of place. Also x2, unless I cook the duck breast entirely on the stovetop, I'll need the oven for both the duck and the potatoes. Is 400F an okay temperature so that I can do both at the same time? Also x3, I'm planning to serve apple sorbet as a palate cleanser, but I don't know if I should serve it before, during, or after this course; I'm leaning towards serving them at the same time.

**4. Salad: Dandelion greens, pickled apples, goat cheese, candied pecans, and maple-balsamic vinaigrette salad**  
I'm not set on the greens here. If dandelion greens aren't available then I'll use kale, but if there's anything more thematically appropriate then I'd like to hear! I'm also somewhat concerned about the repetition of goat cheese and maple syrup, but I'm hoping that there's enough space between the amuse-bouche and this that it's okay, especially since the amuse-bouche is of course so small.

**5. Dessert: Poached apples with dark chocolate ganache and vanilla ice cream**

**6. Coffee**  
I'll serve the coffee with apple cider caramels as sort of 'mignardises'.

Is this generally an okay menu, or am I out of my mind? Do I need more vegetables, and should bread be included with any of these courses? And when should I plan to start serving food? I'm especially concerned that these dishes don't actually go together as well as I think they do and, though maybe it's silly since I admitted to actively taking creative liberties, that it's not Thanksgiving-y enough. I'd like feedback specifically on flavors, textures, temperatures, and ease of cooking all this while also trying to socialize. Thanks!",2,1763002572.0,AskCulinary,1,1.0,False

V.C. P.I.M.P. , just a greybeard hobbyist who is having a blast with these tools.

I built using Claude and Codex, both from within VSCode. I have the entry tier for both platforms. I have a strong tech background, but haven't fucked with HTML since mySpace and I'm only vaguely aware of what CSS actually is. JavaScript? That's the thing I write my coffee order down on. 

All that to say, while I'm very weak in the languages, being able to ""see"" a program in my head and describe it was incredibly helpful. Understanding how to program is more important, imho, than knowing any particular language. 

The best strategies I've found so far: in each new session, I have the agent read an AI onboarding guide (also on my gh) which is a general list of guidelines from lessons learned in previous sessions. I periodically ask the agent to update it when we identify successful patterns or I have a novel experience.

I start my planning by describing the high level ideas and any details I've already noted, finishing with ""what do you think of this? let me know if you have any questions or suggestions""

next we iterate over the plan with more detail, identifying specific files, functions, modules etc by name. if the agent is vague, I dig in with ""in point X, what are you going to do specifically?"" if they're weak.

Usually 1-3 cycles of this and we're ready to code. Agents do 100% of the work and I provide testing and UI guidance. For the most part, they were successful on the first pass, and when they weren't only needed minor guidance or clarification to correct. Claude also pulled off a fairly big (imho) refactor and modularization project with only one small UI error.

I know a lot of people like to poopoo AI for what it doesn't (yet) do well, but I'm constantly in awe of how capable these tools are.

1ovpp6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ovpp6h/the_highway_recorder/,The Highway Recorder,"I bought the dashcam at a rest stop somewhere in Nebraska. Two in the morning, fluorescent lights humming overhead, the kind of place where the coffee burns your throat and tastes like chemicals. I’d been driving for sixteen hours straight, hauling machine parts from Toledo to Sacramento, and my eyes felt like they’d been rubbed with sandpaper.

The cashier was a kid with acne scars and bloodshot eyes. Travis, according to his name tag. He was scrolling through his phone with the blank expression of someone who’d given up on sleep years ago.

I grabbed a sandwich from the cooler, a bag of chips, something with enough salt and preservatives to keep me awake another four hours. That’s when I noticed the dashcam sitting on the counter in a clear plastic bag. Older model, boxy, cracked lens cover. Cords tangled around it like dead vines.

How much? I asked.

Twenty bucks, Travis said without looking up. Works fine.

I should have asked why he was selling it. Should have wondered what kind of person unloads a dashcam at a gas station in the middle of the night. But I was three days into a cross-country haul, running on four hours of sleep and truck stop stimulants, and twenty dollars was cheap insurance against the kind of fraud I’d been hearing about from other drivers. Rear-end collisions blamed on the trucker. Pedestrians throwing themselves in front of rigs for settlement money.

I paid, stuffed the camera into my jacket, and walked back out into the cold.

The parking lot was nearly empty at this hour, just a handful of semis scattered across the cracked asphalt like sleeping giants. The wind cut across the open space, carrying the smell of diesel and wet pavement. My truck sat at the far end, running lights glowing amber in the darkness, engine still idling to keep the cab warm. I’d left it running out of habit, the way you leave a porch light on when you live alone.

The truck was a ten-year-old Peterbilt 579, diesel and stale food smell baked into the upholstery. It wasn’t much, but it was mine, bought with a loan I’d be paying off for another three years. The sleeper cab had carried me across more miles than I cared to count, from coast to coast and back again, a rolling home that smelled like rubber and exhaust.

I climbed in, tossed the sandwich onto the passenger seat, and pulled the dashcam from my pocket. No instruction manual, just a suction cup mount and a single button on the side. I pressed it. A red LED blinked to life.

I stuck it to the windshield above the rearview mirror, plugged the cord into the cigarette lighter. The screen flickered, showed a grainy image of the parking lot, then went dark. Good enough.

I fired up the engine, felt the cab shudder as the diesel turned over, and pulled back onto the interstate. The white lines began their endless blur beneath my headlights.

Three days passed. Omaha to Boise with machine parts, then a pickup of canned goods heading east. The rhythm of long-haul trucking settled over me like a familiar blanket, both comforting and suffocating. Truck stop coffee that tasted like battery acid, static-filled AM radio stations fading in and out as I crossed state lines. Talk radio hosts ranting about politics I didn’t care about, country songs about lost loves and open roads, advertisements for lawyers who specialized in accident claims.

I ate most of my meals behind the wheel, one hand on the steering wheel while the other unwrapped gas station sandwiches or shoveled cold french fries into my mouth. I pissed in bottles when the next rest stop was too far away. I showered every third day at truck stops that charged ten dollars for five minutes of lukewarm water. The hours bled together into a gray soup of highway and rest stops, days measured in miles instead of time, my life reduced to the view through a windshield and the sound of tires on asphalt.

The camera blinked red on my windshield, and I forgot it was there.

Then outside Salt Lake City, a sedan swerved into my lane without signaling. I nearly clipped it, felt the Peterbilt lurch as I yanked the wheel. That night, parked at a rest area under a flickering streetlight, I remembered I could check the footage. Evidence, just in case the sedan driver decided to file a false claim.

I dug the memory card from the camera, booted up my laptop from behind the passenger seat, and waited for the files to load. There were a dozen video clips, each timestamped. I found the one from earlier that day and hit play.

Grainy afternoon sun. The sedan drifting into frame. My voice muttering a curse. Perfect. I was about to eject the card when I noticed something wrong.

The folder showed files going back two weeks. I’d only owned the camera for three days.

A chill crawled up my spine. I clicked on one of the older videos, dated ten days before I’d bought the device. The footage showed my truck. Same dashboard, same air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror, same coffee-stained cup holder. But the angle was from the passenger seat, looking across the cab at me behind the wheel. My hand on the gearshift, eyes on the road, completely unaware I was being filmed.

The camera was mounted on the windshield. It couldn’t record from the passenger seat. It was physically impossible.

A chill crawled up my spine, slow and deliberate, like cold fingers walking up my vertebrae. I felt my scalp tighten, felt the hair on my arms stand up beneath my jacket sleeves. My mouth had gone dry. I swallowed, but it didn’t help. The saliva tasted metallic, like fear has a flavor.

I checked another file. This one showed the exterior of my truck, filmed from outside the windshield looking in. I could see myself through the glass, face slack, eyes half-closed, fighting sleep in the dark. The footage shook slightly, unsteady, like it was handheld. But there was no one holding it. Just me, alone in the cab, driving through empty night.

I closed the laptop. My hands were shaking. The cab suddenly felt smaller, the air thicker, like the walls were pressing in. I told myself it was a glitch, corrupted files from a previous owner that hadn’t been properly erased. Cameras malfunction all the time. Memory cards degrade. Data gets corrupted. Cross-contamination between files, maybe, or some weird artifact of how the device stored footage. There had to be a rational explanation, something technical I didn’t understand because I wasn’t an engineer or a computer expert.

But even as I tried to convince myself, I knew I was lying. Deep down, in that animal part of the brain that recognizes danger before the conscious mind catches up, I knew something was wrong with that camera. Something fundamental and impossible and deeply, terribly wrong.

But I couldn’t shake the image of myself being filmed from angles that didn’t exist. Couldn’t stop thinking about that footage of the passenger seat, of the view through the windshield from outside, of myself sleeping unaware while something watched and recorded.

I pulled back onto the highway and tried to ignore the blinking red light above me. The road stretched empty ahead, just white lines and darkness and the occasional semi hauling through the night. By morning, when the sun came up and turned the sky the color of rust, I’d almost convinced myself I’d imagined it.

Almost.

Four days later, parked at a weigh station outside Cheyenne while I waited for my logbook inspection to clear, I decided to check the footage again. I told myself I just needed to see normal recordings, proof that the previous files had been a fluke. But when I opened the folder, there were new files. Dozens of them. All dated within the last four days.

The most recent showed my truck from an overhead angle, as though the camera was mounted on the ceiling of the cab. But it was still on the windshield. I could see it in the frame, red LED blinking in the lower corner like a tiny eye.

I watched myself sleep in the bunk behind the driver’s seat, curled on my side, one arm draped over the mattress edge. The angle shifted slowly, deliberately, panning across the cab like a surveillance camera. It lingered on my face. Zoomed in slightly, close enough that I could see the stubble on my jaw, the way my eyelids twitched during REM sleep. Then it pulled back.

No sound except the faint hum of static. But I could feel it watching. Studying me like a specimen under glass.

I ejected the memory card and held it in my palm. It was warm, warmer than it should have been, almost hot to the touch. Like it had been running a processor at full capacity.

I thought about throwing the whole camera away. Smashing it against the pavement and walking away. Instead, I slid the card back into the slot, closed the laptop, and sat there in the cab, staring at the red light on my windshield, trying to understand what it wanted from me.

A week later, I found footage dated three days in the future.

I stared at the timestamp, certain I’d misread it. But the numbers didn’t change. Three days from now. I recognized the road in the clip immediately, a lonely two-lane route through the Nevada desert I was scheduled to drive later that week. In the footage, I was gripping the wheel with both hands, shoulders tense, eyes flicking to the rearview mirror every few seconds like I was expecting something to appear behind me.

I watched myself reach for the radio, twist the dial through static, then glance out the side window at the empty desert rolling past. Thirty seconds of footage, then it cut to black, replaced by crackling static.

The camera was recording things that hadn’t happened yet. Events that existed only as future possibilities, somehow captured and stored on a memory chip.

I didn’t tell anyone. Didn’t call a friend or a mechanic or anyone who might have an explanation. Because what would I say? That my dashcam could see the future? They’d think I’d been on the road too long, that the isolation and sleepless nights had finally broken something in my head.

So I kept driving. Kept the footage to myself. And when the day came, three days later, I drove that Nevada highway and lived out the scene exactly as I’d watched it. Every movement identical. The way I gripped the wheel with both hands. The way I reached for the radio and heard nothing but static. The way I glanced out the window at the exact moment a vulture circled overhead.

It was like I was following a script written by someone else.

That night, when I checked the footage, I found the same clip recorded again. Same highway, same thirty seconds, same movements. But this time filmed from outside the truck, looking in through the driver’s side window. The perspective was impossible, hovering in mid-air beside my door as I drove seventy miles an hour down an empty road.

I watched myself grip the wheel, reach for the radio, glance at the mirror.

And I watched something else.

A shadow in the passenger seat. Faint, barely visible against the gray interior fabric, like a smudge of darkness that didn’t quite belong. But it was there, shifting slightly, adjusting its position as though trying to get comfortable.

I rewound the footage and watched again. The shadow moved. Independently. Separate from any trick of light or reflection.

I hadn’t been alone in the truck that day.

For the next seventy-two hours, I barely slept. Couldn’t. Every time I tried to close my eyes in the bunk, I’d see that shadow in the passenger seat, shifting and adjusting like it was settling in for a long drive. I’d imagine I could feel it there even now, sitting beside me in the darkness, watching me with eyes I couldn’t see.

I started talking to myself just to fill the silence. Narrating my own actions like a sports commentator. Now I’m checking the mirrors. Now I’m adjusting my speed. Now I’m taking this exit for fuel. Anything to prove I was still in control, still the one making decisions, still autonomous and real and not just some puppet being filmed by an invisible audience.

The isolation got worse. Long-haul trucking is lonely by nature, but this was different. This was the loneliness of being observed without being seen. The kind of isolation that comes from knowing you’re never truly alone, that something is always watching, always recording, always there in your blind spot.

I stopped using the bunk entirely. Started pulling twenty-hour shifts behind the wheel, downing energy drinks until my hands shook and my vision blurred at the edges. Better to stay awake than risk what the camera might show me while I slept. Better to keep moving than give it time to record me at rest, vulnerable, unaware.

Other truckers started giving me weird looks at the truck stops. I caught my reflection in a bathroom mirror one morning and understood why. Bloodshot eyes with dark circles underneath like bruises. Three days of stubble. Hair greasy and unwashed. The look of a man coming apart at the seams.

But I couldn’t stop checking the footage. Every night, I’d review what the camera had captured, scrolling through clip after clip, trying to find a pattern, trying to understand the rules of whatever game I’d stumbled into. The camera recorded constantly, capturing angles that defied every law of physics I understood. One clip showed me from inside my own skull, the dashboard warping and bending through what looked like a fisheye lens embedded directly in my brain. Another showed the highway from hundreds of feet above, my truck reduced to a tiny speck crawling across vast desert emptiness.

I stopped sleeping. The bunk felt exposed, vulnerable, like I was lying on a stage beneath invisible spotlights. I’d lie there with my eyes open, staring at the ceiling, listening to the engine’s constant hum and the creak of the suspension over rough pavement. Every time I closed my eyes, the footage played on a loop inside my head. All those impossible angles, all those perspectives that shouldn’t exist.

The camera wasn’t just recording anymore. It was predicting. Showing me moments of danger before they happened, like warnings from some mechanical oracle. A blown tire on a mountain pass, captured two days before the blowout. A drunk driver swerving into my lane, filmed from an angle that showed his face through his windshield before I’d even seen his headlights. Black ice on a Montana bridge, the footage showing my truck starting to fishtail before I’d reached that section of road.

I started using the predictions as a guide. If the camera showed me swerving left, I’d swerve at that exact spot and find a pothole that would have shredded my tire. If it showed me braking hard, I’d slow down and watch a deer bolt across the highway exactly where I would have been. It worked. Every time. I avoided accidents, sidestepped disasters, stayed one step ahead of the road’s casual brutality.

But the cost was measurable in sleepless nights and frayed nerves. Because the angles grew more invasive with every passing day. Clips filmed from behind my eyes, showing the dashboard from inside my own vision. Footage from inside my chest cavity, my heartbeat visible as a pulsing red glow. Perspectives that made my hands shake and my stomach turn, that made me question whether I was still the one in control of my own body.

The camera was burrowing deeper, peeling back layers of reality like skin from an onion, trying to get at something underneath.

Then I found the final recording.

Dated exactly one week ahead. Thursday night, 11:47 PM. The footage showed my truck on a Montana highway I recognized immediately, a long desolate road through the badlands where cell service died and the only lights were stars. I was driving, both hands white-knuckled on the wheel, face pale and drawn in the dashboard’s green glow.

I watched myself glance at the rearview mirror. My eyes were wide, pupils blown huge like I’d seen something terrible. The truck drifted left, crossed the faded yellow center line, then jerked back with an overcorrection that made the whole rig shudder. I reached for the radio with one trembling hand, twisted the dial frantically through nothing but static. Then I looked out the side window, and my mouth opened like I was screaming, but there was no sound in the footage.

The clip cut abruptly to a new angle. From somewhere impossibly high above, looking straight down at the highway like footage from a satellite or drone. I watched the Peterbilt drift again, this time all the way across the center line into the opposite lane. No other traffic anywhere, no headlights in either direction, just my truck swerving wildly as though I’d lost all control.

The camera zoomed in slowly, deliberately, focusing on the cab. Through the windshield I could see myself slumped forward over the wheel, head lolling to one side, arms hanging limp. The truck veered right, left the pavement, hit the gravel shoulder in a spray of dust and stones. Then it began to roll.

Once. The world inverting, windows shattering into diamonds of glass.

Twice. Metal screaming as the cab crumpled, the trailer jackknifing behind.

Three times. A slow-motion collapse of everything I owned, everything I was, turning into twisted wreckage.

The footage ended with the truck on its side in the ditch, wheels still spinning uselessly in the air, steam or smoke rising from the crumpled hood in pale streamers. Then the screen went black.

I sat there in my parked truck, staring at the laptop screen, feeling my heart slam against my ribs hard enough to hurt. My mouth had gone completely dry. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold the laptop steady.

The camera had just shown me my own death. In perfect detail. From multiple impossible angles.

I checked the timestamp three more times, hoping I’d misread it. But the numbers stayed the same. Thursday, one week from tonight. 11:47 PM. I had a delivery scheduled through that exact area, industrial equipment heading to a fabrication plant outside Billings. The route dispatcher had given me would take me through the Montana badlands on Thursday night, along that precise stretch of highway.

I could change the route. I told myself that for six straight days. I spent those days trying every angle I could think of.

I called dispatch, claimed I was having mechanical trouble. They rerouted me through Wyoming instead. But then the Wyoming route got shut down due to a wildfire, and dispatch put me back on the Montana highway.

I had the brakes professionally inspected. They were fine. I replaced all four tires even though they had another ten thousand miles on them. I caught up on sleep, ate decent meals instead of gas station junk, made sure I was rested and alert and thinking clearly.

But none of it mattered. A detour here, a last-minute schedule change there, a series of small decisions and circumstances I couldn’t predict or control. All of it herding me back toward that moment, correcting my course every single time I tried to deviate. It was like the universe itself was conspiring to put me on that highway at that exact time, ensuring the footage would come true.

By Wednesday night, I’d given up trying to fight it. I accepted the inevitable. I reached the Montana badlands just before midnight, the road empty and dark under a sliver of moon that barely lit the asphalt. I checked the dashboard clock as I drove.

11:42 PM.

Five minutes.

I thought about stopping. Pulling over right now, getting out, walking away into the desert and letting whatever was going to happen happen without me inside the truck. But my hands stayed locked on the wheel. My foot stayed steady on the accelerator. The camera kept blinking its red eye above me, patient and inevitable.

11:44 PM.

Three minutes. My heart was hammering. Sweat ran down my back despite the cold air blowing from the vents. The highway stretched ahead into darkness, empty except for the white lines marking the center. No other vehicles. No lights. Just me and the road and the approaching moment.

11:45 PM.

I glanced at the rearview mirror, exactly as I had in the footage. My eyes were wide, pupils dilated with adrenaline. I looked terrified. I looked like a man staring at his own grave. My hand reached for the radio without conscious thought, muscle memory following the script. I twisted the dial.

Static erupted from the speakers, a hissing crackling roar that made my teeth ache and my skull hurt. It filled the cab completely, drowning out even the rumble of the diesel engine. The sound was wrong, somehow. Not like normal radio static. More organic. More alive. Like something breathing, or screaming, or trying to communicate in a language made of white noise and interference.

And in that moment, surrounded by that shrieking emptiness, with my hands locked on the wheel and my foot pressed to the accelerator and the dashboard clock glowing 11:45 PM, I understood.

I understood everything.

The camera hadn’t shown me the crash from multiple angles by accident. Every impossible perspective, every angle that defied the laws of space and time and physics, was a thread. A connection. A command. The device wasn’t just predicting my future or documenting my present. It was writing it. Constructing reality frame by frame, angle by angle, weaving me into a narrative I couldn’t escape because I was already living inside it.

Every clip I’d watched had been a blueprint. Instructions. A script for a play I didn’t know I was performing. And I’d followed them all. Every swerve to avoid the pothole. Every brake before the drunk driver appeared. Every movement captured in future footage that I then lived out precisely, thinking I was avoiding danger when really I was just confirming the camera’s predictions, making them real, completing the loop.

The camera wasn’t showing me what would happen. It was showing me what I would do. What I had to do. Because I’d already seen it, and seeing it made it inevitable.

I was trapped in a causal loop of my own observation.

11:47 PM.

I yanked the wheel hard to the right. The truck lurched violently, tires shrieking against asphalt, the whole rig shuddering as it fought against momentum and inertia. I slammed both feet on the brake pedal, felt the anti-lock system stutter and pulse beneath my heel. The cab fishtailed, the trailer trying to swing around and jackknife.

The dashboard clock glowed green in the chaos.

11:47 PM.

The exact moment. The exact time I was supposed to lose control and die.

But I didn’t.

The truck bucked and shuddered and finally came to a stop on the shoulder, half on gravel, half on dirt. I threw the gearshift into park with hands that wouldn’t stop shaking. Sat there in the sudden silence, chest heaving, heart slamming, alive.

The camera blinked above me. Red LED pulsing in the darkness. And for the first time since I’d bought the device, I felt like it was actually looking at me. Not recording. Not predicting. Just staring. Considering. Recalculating.

I got out of the truck. My legs nearly gave out when my boots hit the ground. The night air was brutally cold, sharp enough to cut through my jacket and jeans like they weren’t there. My breath came out in ragged clouds. I walked around to the passenger side on legs that felt made of water, opened the door, and reached for the camera.

My hand hovered over the suction cup mount. All I had to do was pull. Rip the device free, throw it into the darkness beyond the shoulder, and drive away. Start over. Forget any of this had happened.

But standing there in the freezing dark, listening to the wind whistle across the empty badlands, I realized something that made my blood turn cold.

It was too late.

The camera had already recorded this moment. Me, standing outside the truck in the middle of the night, hand reaching for the mount but not quite touching it. Me, hesitating. Me, realizing the futility. Me, walking away without destroying the thing that had tried to kill me.

It had seen all of this coming. Predicted my escape, my survival, my moment of defiance. Which meant it had already moved past this. Already recorded what came next. Already woven me into whatever narrative followed.

I was still in its story. I’d never stopped being in its story.

I climbed back into the cab, hands numb, and started the engine. Not toward Billings. Not toward the fabrication plant or the delivery or any obligation I’d had before tonight. I turned the truck around and drove in the opposite direction, putting miles between myself and that stretch of highway as fast as the Peterbilt would carry me.

I drove until I reached a truck stop outside Bozeman, just as the sun was starting to paint the eastern sky pale orange. I parked in the back lot, grabbed my duffel bag with my clothes and wallet and nothing else, and walked away from the truck without looking back.

The camera stayed on the windshield, suction cup still firmly attached, red LED still blinking into the empty cab. Let it record whatever it wanted to record. Let it document the empty driver’s seat and the dashboard and the abandoned controls. I was done being its subject.

I spent three weeks in a cheap motel outside Bozeman, paying cash daily, keeping my head down and the curtains drawn. I ignored the increasingly angry calls from dispatch, ignored the mounting penalties and breach-of-contract fees for the abandoned delivery. None of it mattered anymore. I had bigger problems than money or reputation.

Every night I closed my eyes and saw that footage. Saw myself slumped over the wheel, the truck rolling, the metal crumpling like paper. Saw all those impossible angles, all those perspectives that documented my death from places a camera couldn’t reach. The images were burned into my brain, permanent as scars.

Eventually, I got a call from a salvage yard in Butte. They’d found my truck at a state auction, bought it cheap, and were prepping it for resale. Did I want to pick up any personal belongings I’d left in the cab? Tools, clothes, anything valuable?

I told them no. Told them to junk the whole rig, camera and all, crush it into a cube and be done with it.

But they didn’t.

A week later, scrolling through a trucker forum on a library computer, I saw a post that made my stomach drop. Someone had bought a used Peterbilt at auction, great condition, barely any miles, amazing deal. And it came with a dashcam already installed, the new owner wrote. Camera works perfectly. Already started using it to document my routes. Best twenty bucks the previous owner ever spent.

I stared at the screen for a long time. I wanted to reply, to send a private message, to warn them about what that camera really was and what it would do to them. But what would I say? That the dashcam records the future? That it films you from angles that don’t exist? That it would show them their own death and then make sure it happened?

They’d think I was insane. Report me. Block me. And maybe they’d be right. Maybe I was insane. Maybe I’d been on the road too long and something in my head had finally snapped.

But I didn’t think so.

I never went back to trucking. Found a job at a distribution warehouse on the outskirts of Missoula, loading freight onto pallets, driving a forklift, doing the kind of mindless physical work where you don’t have to think or make decisions or be responsible for anything more complicated than moving boxes from point A to point B.

I kept my head down. Avoided cameras. Avoided mirrors when I could. Took side streets instead of highways, walked instead of driving, tried to stay out of any space where I might be recorded.

Because every now and then, I’d catch my reflection in a storefront window or a piece of glass, and the angle would be wrong.

Just slightly off. Just enough to notice if you were paying attention.

Like I was being viewed from somewhere to my left, or my right, or from above, instead of straight-on the way reflections are supposed to work. Like there was a lens somewhere I couldn’t see, still documenting, still recording, still building its narrative frame by frame.

And I’d wonder if the camera was still out there. If somewhere in some other trucker’s cab, in some other truck rolling down some other highway, there was footage of me right now. Me standing here on this street corner in Missoula. Me staring at my own wrong-angled reflection. Me realizing that I’d never really escaped at all.

That I was still in the story. Still being recorded. Still following a script I couldn’t see.

And maybe, somewhere in those files, there was footage of what came next. Of how my story ended. Of the moment when I finally stopped running and the camera caught up with me.

Maybe it had already recorded my last day.

Maybe it was just waiting for me to live it.

I matched with a few guys who wanted to meet later in the week, but that wouldn’t work for me. I needed it now and I was flying out soon, so there wouldn’t be enough time.

Then I matched with this one guy I’m pretty sure I even superliked because he was exactly my type. Tall as fuck. Great body. Loved pets. Same values. Wanted fun, intimacy, no commitment. Perfect. I told him, let’s meet tonight — and we did. We went to an arcade bar, had drinks, food, and played games. The conversation flowed easily, at least for me. After a short walk, we went to his car to “warm up”, and I knew what I was there for. We made out for a bit and I told him I wasn’t doing it in his car, we should go to his place instead. He said he lived an hour away and asked if that was okay. I said fuck yeah. So sleeping over was clearly on the table. I asked if he was fine with it, and he said yes.

We were playful the whole time. I even joked about him murdering me, but I had the advantage because no one knew who he was with. He told me to text my sister his address. He even showed me his driver’s licence before that, so I wasn’t worried.

We got to his place, he showed me around, and then we did the deed. It was insane — the best sex I’ve ever had. Everything just worked. He was big, strong, confident, all the spots were hit, the dirty talk was on point — everything.

The next morning, he made me breakfast. We cuddled, watched a film, napped, smoked, cuddled again. We were glued to each other. Skin always touching. Sniffing each other. Making out for long stretches even without having sex. Then sex again. And again. It felt like every 30 minutes.

He drove me home after, bought me Starbucks on the way, and we held hands the whole drive. I took over his phone’s Spotify and he didn’t mind at all.

He wanted to see me again that same night, so I Uber’d an hour to him. I brought him snacks from my culture we talked about, plus a spare hand cream since we’d joked about his dry hands. He seemed to like the gesture — he kept the hand cream in his car and I watched him use it constantly.

We watched Netflix, had more sex, and talked deeply about everything — family, grief, dogs, work, life. Then more sex. The next morning, I worked while he slept, then he woke up, made me coffee, and we went right back to cuddling and having sex again.

Three days before I had to leave, he said he wanted to take me out to dinner before I flew home. After work, he took me to a bar near my place. And this is where everything gets confusing.

He regularly talked about wanting to visit me in my home country. That night, he pinky-promised he’d visit in February. I didn’t care if this was just sex or him lovebombing — but I didn’t realise this was part of the game. He didn’t have to say any of that or make me hopeful. I knew we were both there for sex and intimacy for a short time. He could’ve just stopped.

But he kept going. He told me I was the girl of his dreams. That if it weren’t for the distance, he’d pursue me. That I was amazing. And sure, fine, but he didn’t need to pile it on. He even brought up FaceTiming after work once I got home so we could catch up. I DIDN’T ASK FOR THAT. None of it was me initiating — it was him saying all of it.

After dinner, we had a great night. We took pictures together — he suggested it and said he wanted “cute photos” from our last night. The next day, we were still talking. Even on the day I flew out, he was messaging me at the airport telling me to text him on my layover because he’d be awake. So I did, because I thought he meant it.

Since landing back home on Monday, it’s been radio silence. Nothing. He even posted on Instagram six hours ago but didn’t bother replying to me. This same guy who said “you have my word”, who said he’d book a one-way flight in November, who said he’d come see how long he could stay.

This is my first time being ghosted. I’ve hooked up before, but hookups never hurt because I knew my boundaries. I kept conversations shallow and didn’t let myself get comfortable. But this one made me let my guard down because I thought he was genuinely into me. Turns out, he was just better at the game. And I got played.

I’m so hurt. And as much as I want to double text and ask why, I know I shouldn’t.",2,1763002076.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Proof: 142
Age: 7 years
Mashbill: 100% corn
Price: $140 (South Carolina, 2025)

Distilled and aged in Richmond, Virginia by Reservoir Distillery. Aged in alligator char, 5 gallon barrels (this is a 3 barrel blend).

Rested for 20 minutes.

Nose: Heavy barrel char, jammy blackberries, burnt caramel, buttered popcorn and roasted nuts. Subtle vanilla buttercream peaks out from the darkness.

7/10

Taste: Front of the palate is set ablaze with every sip. Intense cinnamon candies (Atomic Fireballs), dark jammy blackberries. Dark chocolate, almost a dark roast coffee at times.

7/10

Finish: Long. The cinnamon candies from the palate linger for quite awhile. Touch of mocha.

7/10

Verdict: 7/10

This is one of those whiskeys that is just a wild ride from start to finish. While the proof was clearly the selling point, I think it’s also ultimately the main thing holding it back. I sat with this pour for well over an hour and didn’t feel like I had really established any concrete notes in that time.

This idea was reinforced when I added a splash of water to the last 1/4oz in my glass. The immediate singe when attempting to nose was gone and the front of the palate no longer set ablaze with every sip. It’s still aggressive, but slightly more approachable.

Of all the ‘hazmat’ whiskeys I own, this is my least favorite. It feels like a perfect example of just because it can be 140+ proof, doesn’t mean it should.",5,1763002035.0,bourbon,1,1.0,False

I’ve been a paramedic for seven years. Seven years of graveyard shifts, and I can tell you that working nights changes you. It has to.

You see things in the dark that daylight has the decency to hide. You learn a town by its emergencies, its accidents, its moments when everything goes wrong. You know which intersections are hungry. Which houses keep calling you back. Which roads seem cursed by something more than bad luck.

The job gets in your blood. It becomes part of you. You start measuring time in shifts instead of days. Start judging the severity of situations before you even arrive. Start knowing, just by the sound of a dispatcher’s voice, whether you’re about to save a life or bag a body.

You develop instincts. Gut feelings. The kind that tell you when something’s wrong before your conscious mind catches up. When to push harder on compressions. When to call for backup. When to take the long way because the shortcut’s going to cost you time you don’t have.

I know every road in my territory. Every turn, every pothole, every place where the asphalt gives way to gravel and hope. I know which bridges flood in spring. Which farmhouses keep vicious dogs. Which gas stations have the cleanest bathrooms at three in the morning.

I know where the cell signal dies. Where the GPS gets confused. Where the locals still give directions by landmarks that haven’t existed in twenty years.

Except one.

I’d never heard of Old Miller Road.

I’d never heard of Old Miller Road until three weeks ago. That’s the thing that bothers me most. In seven years, covering forty miles of rural territory outside Ashford, I’d never once heard that name. Not from dispatch, not from other medics, not from the old timers who’ve been doing this since before I was born.

My name is Jake Hendricks. I work for County Medical Services. Population out here is maybe eight thousand if you count the farms. It’s the kind of place where the same families have lived for generations. Where roads still have names like “The Hutchins Place” even though the Hutchins moved away in ’87. Where everyone knows everyone, and nothing stays secret for long.

So how did I miss an entire road?

The calls started on a Tuesday. I was parked outside the 24-hour gas station on Route 9. The only place with decent coffee at two in the morning. My partner Marcus was inside getting us refills. The radio crackled.

“Unit Seven, we have a possible 10-50 with injuries, Old Miller Road, approximately two miles east of the junction.”

I grabbed the radio. “Dispatch, Unit Seven. Can you repeat that location?”

“Old Miller Road, two miles east of junction. Caller reports single vehicle accident, driver may be unconscious.”

“Dispatch, I’m not familiar with Old Miller Road. Can you provide cross streets or GPS coordinates?”

Silence. Long silence. Just that particular hiss of dead air that makes you think something’s gone wrong with the equipment.

“Unit Seven, stand by.”

Marcus climbed back in, handed me a coffee. Black, two sugars, the way I always take it. He saw my face.

“What’s wrong?”

“Dispatch has a call on Old Miller Road. Ever heard of it?”

He frowned. Took a sip. Shook his head. “No. That’s in our territory?”

“Apparently.”

Marcus had been my partner for three years. We’d worked together long enough that we could communicate without words. Long enough that I knew his ex-wife’s name and he knew about my father’s heart condition. Long enough that I trusted him with my life, and he trusted me with his.

We’d seen bad things together. The kind of things that stick with you. A teenager who’d wrapped his car around a telephone pole doing ninety. A grandmother who’d fallen down the stairs and laid there for three days before anyone found her. A construction worker who’d been crushed by equipment, still conscious, still talking, knowing he was dying and there wasn’t a damn thing we could do about it.

Those calls bond you. Make you family in a way most people never understand.

So when Marcus looked concerned, I paid attention.

The radio crackled again. “Unit Seven, dispatch. We’re having trouble pulling up that location. Stand by for GPS coordinates.”

More silence. The kind that feels heavy, wrong.

“Unit Seven, we’re unable to verify the location at this time. Caller disconnected. We’ll attempt a callback and get you more information. Disregard for now.”

Marcus shrugged. “Probably a prank. You know how kids get.”

I nodded. But something about it sat wrong in my stomach. Dispatch doesn’t usually put calls through without verifying location first. And the dispatcher’s voice, that uncertainty, it wasn’t normal. These people were professionals. They knew the territory as well as I did.

Better, even.

We finished our coffee. The rest of the shift was routine. A drunk college kid with a busted nose from a bar fight. An elderly woman with chest pains that turned out to be heartburn. Normal Tuesday night stuff.

I forgot about Old Miller Road.

Until three nights later.

I was parked outside the hospital, finishing paperwork from a transfer. Marcus was inside, flirting with one of the night nurses. The radio crackled.

“Unit Seven, we have a reported 10-50 with possible entrapment, Old Miller Road, approximately three miles north of the county line.”

My hand was on the radio before the dispatcher finished talking.

“Dispatch, Unit Seven. I need clarification on that location. We received a similar call earlier this week and couldn’t verify the road.”

“Unit Seven, caller states Old Miller Road, three miles north of county line. Reporting a vehicle that appears to have left the roadway.”

“Dispatch, can you provide GPS coordinates? I don’t have that road on any of my maps.”

Static. That same dead air I’d heard before.

“Unit Seven, GPS system is showing… Stand by.”

I waited. My fingers were tight around the radio. Something about this call felt wrong in a way I couldn’t name. It was like hearing a word you know is misspelled but can’t figure out how.

“Unit Seven, we’re unable to pull coordinates. The system keeps showing an error. We’re attempting to recontact the caller now.”

“Dispatch, who called it in? Is it the same number as the first call?”

A pause. Longer than it should have been.

“Negative, Unit Seven. Different caller. Different number. But caller disconnected before we could get additional information.”

I stared out the windshield at the hospital parking lot. The sodium lights turned everything orange and sickly. My reflection looked back at me from the glass, and for just a moment, I didn’t recognize my own face.

“Dispatch, any other information on the vehicle or caller?”

“Negative, Unit Seven. We’ll keep trying. Stand by.”

The callback never came.

Marcus got back twenty minutes later, grinning because he’d gotten the nurse’s number. I told him about the call. The grin faded fast.

“That’s weird,” he said. “Same road?”

“Same road. Different location. Different caller.”

“You ask the old timers about it?”

I hadn’t. But before our next shift, I did.

Roy Hutchins was in the break room. Roy had been with County Medical for thirty-two years. He knew every road, every farm, every family in the territory. If anyone would know about Old Miller Road, it’d be Roy.

“Roy, you ever heard of a road called Old Miller Road?”

He looked up from his newspaper. His weathered face creased as he frowned. “Old Miller Road?”

“Yeah. I’ve had a couple calls come through dispatch for it, but I can’t find it on any map. Dispatch can’t pull it up either.”

The color drained from his face. It happened so fast, so completely, that for a second I thought he was having a stroke. Then he folded his newspaper very carefully. Set it down on the table. Looked at me with eyes that were suddenly very serious.

“Don’t go looking for that road, Jake.”

“What? Why not?”

“Just don’t. You hear a call come through for Old Miller Road, you tell dispatch you can’t locate it. You understand me?”

“Roy, what the hell are you talking about?”

He stood up. Grabbed his coffee cup. Walked toward the door. Then he stopped, his back to me, his hand on the doorframe.

“There are some roads that don’t want to be found, son. And there are some calls you shouldn’t answer.”

He left me sitting there. Confused and more unsettled than I wanted to admit.

The calls kept coming.

Two more over the next week. Same pattern. Old Miller Road, different locations, different callers who disconnected before providing details. Dispatch unable to verify, GPS showing errors, no coordinates available.

Each call felt like a hook in my chest, pulling me toward something I couldn’t see.

I started asking around. Other paramedics, other dispatchers. Most had never heard of the road. A few reacted like Roy had. That same draining of color. That same warning to let it go.

One of the dispatchers, an older woman named Carol who’d been with the county for twenty years, actually hung up on me when I mentioned it. Just clicked off mid-conversation. When I called back, she said she had another call coming in and couldn’t talk.

But her voice had been shaking.

I couldn’t let it go.

I started digging. County records, old maps, historical archives at the library. I spent my days off, the hours I should have been sleeping, poring through documents. Property deeds, surveyor’s reports, highway department documents.

My girlfriend at the time, Sarah, thought I was losing it. She’d find me at two in the afternoon, after a twelve-hour shift, still awake, still searching through old records on my laptop.

“Jake, you need to sleep,” she’d say. “You’re going to burn out.”

But I couldn’t explain to her what I was feeling. This compulsion. This need to understand. It was like having a word on the tip of your tongue, just out of reach, driving you crazy.

I found nothing. Old Miller Road didn’t exist, not officially. Not on any map printed after 1962.

But I found something else.

In a box of old newspaper clippings from 1963, there was an article about a road closure. Small article, buried on page six, dated September 14th. Miller Road was being permanently closed due to safety concerns. The county had determined the road was too dangerous, too prone to accidents.

Seven fatal crashes in three years. Seven people dead on a five-mile stretch of rural road.

I read the names of the victims. Sarah Chen, 23. Michael Brenner, 45. Patricia Goode and her daughter Jessica, 8. Thomas Walsh, 67. David and Jennifer Martinez, both 31.

All of them dead. All of them on the same road.

The article said the road would be barricaded. New routes would be established. The name would be removed from official maps. There was a quote from the county supervisor saying it was the only responsible choice.

It didn’t say why seven people had died there. It didn’t say what made the road so dangerous. It didn’t mention if there were any survivors. Any witnesses.

It didn’t say what happened to the road after it was closed.

And it didn’t explain why, sixty years later, dispatch was still getting calls from it.

I showed Marcus the article. He read it twice, handed it back, shook his head.

“So it’s a real road. Or was. Maybe there are still old signs out there. Maybe people still call it by that name.”

“Then why can’t we find it? Why won’t GPS pull it up?”

“I don’t know, man. But Roy’s right. This is starting to feel weird. Maybe we should just drop it.”

I should have listened.

But I didn’t.

Three nights later, just past midnight, the call came.

We were parked at our usual spot near the gas station. Marcus had dozed off in the passenger seat, his head against the window. The night was quiet, moonless, the kind of darkness that feels thick enough to touch.

The radio crackled.

“Unit Seven, we have a reported 10-50, possible fatality, Old Miller Road, one quarter mile past the old stone bridge.”

My heart slammed. I grabbed the radio.

“Dispatch, Unit Seven. What stone bridge? I need better directions.”

“Unit Seven, caller states Old Miller Road, one quarter mile past the stone bridge. Reporting a vehicle accident, single occupant, unresponsive.”

“Dispatch, I need GPS coordinates. I don’t know where this road is.”

Static. That familiar, unsettling static.

“Unit Seven, GPS is showing errors again. But the caller provided landmarks. Take Highway 34 north for twelve miles, then turn west on the unmarked road just past the Brennan farm. Follow it for three miles. You’ll see the stone bridge.”

I knew the Brennan farm. Old man Brennan had died last year, but the property was still there. Sprawling fields and outbuildings slowly collapsing into themselves. I’d been out there twice for calls.

But I’d never noticed an unmarked road past it.

“Dispatch, did you get a callback number? Is the caller still on the line?”

“Negative, Unit Seven. Caller disconnected. But they sounded distressed. Said it looked bad.”

Marcus was awake now, listening. He looked at me. I looked at him.

“We going?” he asked.

I should have said no. I should have remembered Roy’s warning. Should have told dispatch we couldn’t locate it. Should have requested another unit.

But I didn’t.

“Yeah,” I said. “We’re going.”

I put the ambulance in gear and pulled onto Highway 34, heading north.

The drive should have taken fifteen minutes. It felt longer. The darkness was absolute, pressing in from all sides. Our headlights carved a tunnel through it, but beyond that tunnel was nothing. No other cars, no houses, no lights anywhere. Just darkness and the white line unwinding endlessly ahead.

The radio played static between us. No music, no chatter, just that low hiss that makes you feel like you’re the last two people alive.

Marcus was quiet. He kept checking his phone, kept looking out the window like he was trying to memorize landmarks. Smart. In case we needed to find our way back.

“This feels wrong,” he said finally.

“I know.”

“We should turn back.”

“I know.”

But I kept driving. My hands were locked on the wheel. My foot steady on the gas. Something was pulling me forward, something stronger than common sense or survival instinct. It felt like being caught in a current. Like drowning in slow motion.

The trees on either side of the highway seemed to lean in closer the further north we went. Their branches reaching over the road like skeletal fingers trying to touch. The pavement beneath us was smooth, recently paved, but the white lines were faded almost to nothing. Like no one had driven this stretch in years.

“How many miles?” Marcus asked.

I checked the odometer. “Eight. Four more to the farm.”

“You sure about this?”

“No.”

He laughed, but there was no humor in it. “Great. That’s real comforting.”

“You didn’t have to come.”

“Yeah, I did. Can’t let you do something stupid alone. That’s what partners do.”

The Brennan farm appeared in our headlights like something from a dream. The old farmhouse dark and leaning, like it was trying to collapse but couldn’t quite commit. The barn partially caved in, its roof sagging under the weight of decay. The fence posts leaned at drunken angles, the wire between them rusted and broken.

Old man Brennan had died of a heart attack in that house. We’d been the ones to respond. Too late, of course. He’d been dead for three days before a neighbor noticed the smell. I remember the flies. The way they buzzed against the windows, angry at being disturbed.

I slowed down, looking for the unmarked road.

And there it was.

I almost missed it. It wasn’t marked, wasn’t paved, was barely even visible. Just a break in the trees, a dirt track leading into the woods. The kind of road you’d drive past a hundred times without noticing.

But there was something about it that made my skin crawl. Something that made every instinct scream at me to keep driving. To not look. To pretend I’d never seen it.

The trees at the entrance were wrong. Their trunks were twisted, bark peeling in long strips. Their branches reached toward each other across the narrow gap, forming a tunnel of skeletal wood.

I turned onto it anyway.

The ambulance bounced and rattled over uneven ground. Tree branches scraped the sides. The headlights showed nothing but trees and dirt and darkness pressing in.

“Jake, I really think we should go back,” Marcus said. His voice was tight.

“Just a little further. If we don’t find anything in the next mile, we’ll turn around.”

I was lying. I wasn’t going to turn around. Something was pulling me forward, something I couldn’t explain or resist. It felt like drowning in slow motion.

“What happens at nightfall?” Marcus asked suddenly.

“What?”

“Earlier. You said we had to do this before nightfall. What happens after dark?”

I didn’t remember saying that. But as soon as he mentioned it, I knew it was true. Something worse happened after dark. Something I couldn’t quite remember but knew with absolute certainty.

The road curved and dipped. Following contours of land that felt wrong. Too steep or too flat or at angles that didn’t make sense. My sense of direction was completely gone. I had no idea if we were heading north or south or sideways into some place that shouldn’t exist.

Then we saw the bridge.

It rose up in our headlights like something from another century. Stone, old and moss-covered, a single arch spanning a creek I couldn’t see the bottom of. The bridge was narrow, barely wide enough for the ambulance. As we crossed it, I heard stones scraping our undercarriage.

On the other side, the road changed.

It was paved now. Smooth and dark, gleaming faintly in our headlights. But the pavement was wrong. It looked ancient, cracked, like it hadn’t been maintained in decades. Yet here it was.

Old Miller Road.

It was real.

“Jesus,” Marcus whispered. “How is this possible?”

I didn’t answer. My hands were white-knuckled on the wheel.

We followed the road for what felt like miles. Time felt strange here, elastic, unreliable. Then, around a curve, we saw it.

The ambulance.

Wrapped around a tree on the right side of the road. Front end crumpled. Hood popped open. Steam or smoke rising from the engine. The lights were still on. All of them. Headlights, emergency lights, everything flashing red and white in the darkness.

And the engine was running. I could hear it from fifty feet away.

Marcus and I looked at each other. He was pale. I probably was too.

I pulled our ambulance to a stop about twenty feet behind the wreck. Put it in park. Grabbed my flashlight. Marcus grabbed the medical kit. We got out.

The night was absolutely silent except for the idling engine. No crickets. No wind. No sound at all. The air smelled wrong. Metallic and sharp, like a storm about to break.

We approached slowly. I played my flashlight over the vehicle.

That’s when I saw it.

The unit number on the side.

Unit Seven.

My unit. Our unit. The same number as the ambulance we’d just driven here.

“Jake,” Marcus said. His voice was shaking. “Jake, that’s—”

“I know.”

But it couldn’t be. It was impossible. We were standing right here. Our ambulance was right behind us, running, undamaged. This had to be different. Maybe an old unit that had been decommissioned. Maybe someone playing a sick joke.

But the number was right there. Unit Seven. And it wasn’t just similar. It was identical. Same decals, same wear patterns, same scratch on the passenger door that Marcus had put there last month backing into a mailbox.

I approached the driver’s side window. It was shattered. Glass covering the seat. I shone my flashlight inside.

The interior was destroyed. Equipment scattered everywhere. Steering wheel bent. Dashboard caved in. The radio was on, crackling with static.

And in that static, I heard something.

A voice.

Distant. Distorted. But definitely a voice.

“…Unit Seven, we have a reported 10-50…”

My voice.

The radio was playing our dispatch calls. All of them. Every call from Old Miller Road, one after another, overlapping and distorting. Creating a chorus of my own voice saying the same things over and over.

“…Old Miller Road…”

“…unable to verify location…”

“…caller disconnected…”

I stumbled back from the window. Marcus caught my arm.

“We need to leave,” he said. “Right now. We need to get the hell out of here.”

But I couldn’t move. I was staring at the ambulance. At the blood on the windshield. At the driver’s seat where someone had died.

Where I had died.

The realization hit me like a punch to the chest. This wasn’t someone else’s ambulance. This was mine. This was us. This was what had happened or was going to happen or was happening right now in some other version of reality.

I walked around to the back. The doors were open, swinging slightly in a breeze I couldn’t feel. I looked inside.

The stretcher was deployed. Sheets soaked with blood. Medical equipment scattered everywhere, like someone had been desperately trying to save a life. My clipboard was on the floor, pages covered in my handwriting.

I picked it up. Shone my flashlight on it.

The words made my head spin.

Notes from calls. Patient information, vital signs, treatment protocols. But the dates were wrong. They were all from the future. Next week, next month, next year. Calls I hadn’t responded to yet.

And at the bottom of the last page, in handwriting I didn’t recognize:

“He keeps trying to find the road. He keeps answering the calls. He can’t help himself. He doesn’t understand that the road found him first.”

I dropped the clipboard. Marcus was beside me, looking over my shoulder.

“What does that mean?” he asked.

I didn’t know. But I was starting to understand something terrible.

The calls hadn’t started three weeks ago. They’d been happening forever. Looping endlessly. Pulling me toward this moment. The road hadn’t been closed because of accidents. It had been closed because it was the accident. A place where time folded in on itself. Where cause and effect stopped making sense.

And I’d driven right into it.

“We need to get back to our ambulance,” I said. “Now.”

We turned around.

Our ambulance was gone.

Where we’d parked it, there was nothing. Just empty road and darkness pressing in.

“No,” Marcus said. “No, no, no. It was right there. It was right fucking there.”

I played my flashlight across the road. No tire tracks. No indication we’d ever parked there. It was like the ambulance had never existed.

Or like we’d never driven it here.

I looked back at the wrecked Unit Seven. Still wrapped around the tree. Still running. Still flashing its emergency lights into nothing.

The radio was still crackling.

“…Unit Seven, we have a reported 10-50, Old Miller Road…”

My voice. Over and over. Calling myself to my own accident.

“Jake, what’s happening?” Marcus was panicking now, his voice high and tight.

I didn’t answer. I was trying to think, trying to understand, but my thoughts kept slipping away like water through fingers.

The road. The calls. The ambulance. They were all connected. All part of the same loop.

I pulled out my phone. No signal. Of course there was no signal.

“We walk,” I said. “We follow the road back to the highway.”

“Which direction?” Marcus asked.

I pointed back the way we’d come. Toward the stone bridge. But even as I did, I wasn’t sure. The road looked different now. The trees closer. The darkness thicker.

We started walking.

The pavement under our feet felt wrong. Too soft. Too yielding. Like walking on something living. Our footsteps echoed in ways they shouldn’t, bouncing back from distances that couldn’t exist.

Behind us, the wrecked ambulance’s lights kept flashing. Kept calling out to anyone who might pass by. But no one would pass by. No one could find this road unless the road wanted to be found.

We walked for what felt like hours. Time was broken here. I could feel it stretching and compressing. Could feel myself existing in multiple moments at once.

Then we saw them.

Lights ahead. Headlights. Moving toward us.

“Thank God,” Marcus said, starting to run. “Someone’s coming.”

But I knew. Even before the vehicle got close enough to see clearly, I knew.

It was an ambulance. Unit Seven. Our unit.

It was us.

The ambulance drove past without slowing, without seeing us. I caught a glimpse through the windshield as it passed. Marcus in the passenger seat. Me behind the wheel.

Both of us staring straight ahead with expressions of grim determination.

Driving toward the accident we’d just left behind.

Marcus had stopped running. He was staring after the ambulance, watching its taillights disappear around the curve.

“That was us,” he said. “That was us driving here. How is that possible?”

I understood then. The horrible, complete understanding that made everything worse.

We hadn’t found Old Miller Road three weeks ago when the first call came in. We’d been here much longer. We’d been here forever. Driving this same route. Answering this same call. Finding this same accident over and over.

The road was a loop. A trap. And we’d been caught in it so long we’d forgotten we were trapped.

“Marcus,” I said slowly. “When did we start working graveyard shift?”

He looked at me, confused. “What? I don’t know. A few months ago?”

“Think harder. When exactly?”

His face went pale as he tried to remember and couldn’t. “I… I don’t remember. Jesus, Jake, I don’t remember.”

Neither did I. I couldn’t remember anything before the calls started. Couldn’t remember my apartment. My family. My life outside of these endless night shifts and this goddamn road.

Because there was nothing to remember. There hadn’t been a before. There was only this, repeating forever.

We heard the crash then. Metal screaming. Glass shattering. The sound of an engine dying. From around the curve where our other selves had just driven.

“No,” Marcus whispered. “No, we can’t go back there. We can’t look.”

But we had to. We always had to. That was part of the loop.

We walked back. Every step felt heavy, wrong, like walking through mud. The darkness pressed in tighter with each step.

When we rounded the curve, the scene was exactly the same. Unit Seven wrapped around the tree. Emergency lights flashing. Engine running. Radio crackling.

But this time, there were two bodies in the front seats.

I didn’t look at their faces. I couldn’t. But I knew who they were.

Marcus made a sound like a wounded animal. “How do we stop this? How do we get out?”

I didn’t know. Maybe we couldn’t. Maybe this was it, forever. Driving to the accident. Finding ourselves dead. Walking away. Forgetting. Doing it all over again.

The radio in the wrecked ambulance crackled. Through the static, I heard a new voice. Not mine. Not dispatch.

“The road only lets you leave when you stop looking for it.”

I turned. There was someone standing on the road behind us. A figure in the darkness, barely visible even with my flashlight.

“Who are you?” I called out.

“Someone who got out. Someone who stopped answering the calls.”

“How?”

The figure stepped closer. A paramedic. Old uniform, at least thirty years out of date. His face was weathered, ancient, but his eyes were clear.

Roy Hutchins.

But Roy was alive. I’d seen him just days ago. Hadn’t I?

“Roy?”

“I was the first one trapped here,” he said. “Back in ’63, right after they closed the road. Took me forty years to figure out how to leave.”

“How?” I asked. “Tell me how.”

“You have to refuse the next call. When dispatch calls for Old Miller Road, you have to let it go. That’s the only way to break the loop. But you’ll forget. You always forget. The road makes you forget.”

“Then how do I remember?”

Roy smiled. Sad and tired. “You can’t. You never will. But maybe this time will be different. Maybe this conversation will stick. Maybe you’ll hear the call and something in the back of your mind will whisper ‘no,’ and you’ll listen.”

He started to fade. Dissolving into the darkness like smoke.

“Wait!” I called. “What happened to the others? The seven people who died here before the road was closed?”

His voice came back faint, distant. “They never died. They’re still here. Still driving. Still answering calls. The road doesn’t kill you. It just keeps you.”

Then he was gone.

Marcus and I stood there in the darkness. Next to our own corpses. In a loop we couldn’t break.

The radio crackled.

“Unit Seven, we have a reported 10-50…”

I woke up in the ambulance. Parked outside the gas station. Marcus was dozing in the passenger seat. My coffee was cold in the cupholder. The radio was quiet.

I looked at the clock. 11:47 PM. Almost midnight.

My head felt fuzzy. Like I was trying to remember a dream that was already slipping away. Something about a road. A call. But the details were gone. Just a vague sense of unease.

Marcus stirred. Yawned. “Man, I keep having the weirdest dreams on this shift.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Me too.”

The radio crackled.

“Unit Seven, we have a reported 10-50 with injuries, Old Miller Road, approximately two miles east of the junction.”

My hand moved toward the radio. Automatic. Instinctive.

Then stopped.

Somewhere deep in my mind, a voice whispered: Don’t answer. Let it go. Don’t look for that road.

I stared at the radio. My hand was shaking.

“Unit Seven, do you copy?”

Marcus was looking at me, waiting for me to respond.

I took a breath.

“Dispatch,” I said slowly. “Unit Seven. Unable to locate that road. Request you send another unit or verify the location.”

Silence. Long, static-filled silence.

Then: “Unit Seven, understood. We’ll redirect. Stand by.”

The call never came back.

Marcus looked at me curiously. “You okay? You look weird.”

“Yeah,” I said. “I’m fine.”

But I wasn’t sure. Because as I sat there in the ambulance, watching the darkness press against the windows, I had the strangest feeling that I’d just escaped something terrible.

Something I’d been trapped in for much longer than I could remember.

And somewhere out there, in the darkness beyond the reach of our headlights, Old Miller Road was still waiting. Still calling. Still pulling in anyone who went looking for it.

The calls would come again. I knew they would. And eventually, I’d forget this moment. Forget the warning. Forget everything.

Eventually, I’d answer.

But not tonight.

Tonight, I let the road stay lost.

I still work graveyard shifts. Still respond to calls in the darkness. Still drive those rural roads I know by heart.

But sometimes, late at night, when the radio crackles with a new call, I feel it. That hesitation. That whisper in the back of my mind telling me to refuse. To let it go. To not look for roads that don’t want to be found.

I don’t know how many times I’ve been trapped in that loop. Don’t know how many times I’ve found my own corpse on Old Miller Road. Don’t know how many versions of myself are still there, still driving, still answering the same call over and over.

All I know is that every time I hear the name Old Miller Road come through the radio, I say no.

And every time I do, I forget why.

But I still say no.

Maybe that’s enough. Maybe that’s all I can do.

The road is patient. It’s been waiting sixty years. It can wait sixty more.

And somewhere, in the darkness between here and there, Roy Hutchins is still driving his ambulance. Still trapped in a loop he figured out how to escape from but never quite managed to leave behind.

Maybe we’re all still there. Maybe we never left.

Maybe every paramedic who’s ever worked these roads is driving through their own version of Old Miller Road. Answering calls that can’t be answered. Finding accidents that haven’t happened yet.

Or maybe I’m just losing my mind.

Either way, I keep driving. I keep working. I keep saving the lives I can save.

And I keep refusing to look for roads that don’t exist.

Because I know something now. Something important, even if I can’t quite remember why I know it.

Some roads don’t want to be found.

And some calls shouldn’t be answered.

I managed to feel drugged and run away, as I knew that something was off, this lady helped and put me somewhere safe. Ever since this event happened, I put it in the back of my mind and thought it was alright. 

Now two days ago, I was at a cafe and the owner was hitting on me, however I was on the phone to my friend and I was ignoring him, but he came close to me and asked what my name was and if I lived around. Then he said the coffee was on the house because he has never seen a beautiful lady like me. 

As i finished the last sip of my coffee, I immediately felt the exact same feeling of when I was in paris and was drugged. my body felt the sedation, and my mind told me run for your life, so I did. 

I found myself running and went into a supermarket I was hidding near the chasier and started hyperventilating because I felt that someone was after me. I got someone to help me in the cashier and called my auntie who came to rescue me.

Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Tales of Berseria, 7th Dragon 2020, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m a liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I have been involved in several CIA backed attempts to overthrow legally elected leaders in foreign countries, specifically between the years of 1960 and 1985.
* I’m Christian


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-40 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~In 1964, the United States was involved in a coup against Brazilian leader João Goulart, specifically providing fuel and weapons to military rebels, as well as assisting in organizing street protests against Goulart. This lead to Goulart’s overthrow and a subsequent 20-year long military dictatorship. Were you in any way, shape, or form, involved in this operation?


Uh...no comment.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

# AMD Stock Surges 10% as CEO Su Projects $100 Billion AI Revenue Target and 35% Annual Growth Through 2030

Advanced Micro Devices shares jumped over 10% Wednesday after CEO Lisa Su unveiled aggressive growth targets at the company’s analyst day, projecting annual revenue growth exceeding 35% over the next three to five years.

The chipmaker set a bold $100 billion data center revenue goal, driven by what Su called “insatiable” AI demand, with AI-related revenue expected to grow 80% annually. Su positioned AMD as an increasingly formidable competitor to Nvidia in the trillion-dollar AI chip market, which the company projects will reach $1 trillion by 2030.

# Putin Approves Citigroup Exit from Russia as Bank Issues Bullish Forecasts on Eli Lilly and Stablecoins

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an order allowing Citigroup to sell its Russian banking unit to Renaissance Capital, marking a significant step in the bank’s global reorganization efforts. The approval comes as the Kremlin maintains tight control over foreign company departures from Russia.

In equity research, Citi analyst Geoff Meacham raised Eli Lilly’s price target to a street-high $1,500 from $1,250 following a meeting with the CEO. The bank dramatically increased its fiscal 2026 oral GLP-1 sales forecast to $1.8 billion from $500 million, well above the $470 million consensus, citing Lilly’s expected “domination of the category.”

# ECB's Schnabel Says Economy Shows Positive Momentum as Inflation Nears Target

European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel said the eurozone is in a ""good place"" with current inflation and medium-term forecasts both near the 2% target. She noted positive underlying economic momentum, with domestic demand offsetting export weakness. Schnabel emphasized the ECB should focus on medium-term trends rather than overreacting to individual data points. She characterized the current balance sheet reduction as ""quantitative normalisation"" rather than tightening. However, Schnabel flagged persistent stickiness in services inflation and said inflation risks tilt slightly to the upside, while noting the ECB can tolerate small deviations from target.

# Fed's Williams Signals Imminent Return to Balance Sheet Growth as Reserves Near Target

Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams indicated the central bank will soon resume expanding its balance sheet once bank reserves reach adequate levels. Williams emphasized the upcoming bond purchases represent a technical adjustment to maintain sufficient reserves rather than a monetary policy shift, noting the Fed is close to its desired reserve level though determining the precise ample threshold remains an inexact science.

# Japan PM Takaichi Pushes BOJ for Wage-Driven Inflation, Warns Deflation Risk Remains

Japanese Prime Minister Takaichi stated Japan has not escaped deflation and called for Bank of Japan collaboration to achieve wage-driven inflation rather than current food-price increases. Takaichi warned that existing inflation patterns risk harming the economy and that wrong policies could trigger renewed deflation. Finance Minister Katayama noted the weak yen contributes to cost-driven inflation, with the currency approaching 155 against the dollar.

# Fed Rate Cut Uncertainty Drives Currency Volatility as Central Banks Diverge

Markets are pricing in a likely Federal Reserve rate cut at the December 9-10 meeting, though internal divisions at the central bank have created uncertainty about the path forward. The dovish Fed outlook is supporting gold prices and weakening the dollar. Meanwhile, the British pound has fallen below 1.3150 as traders anticipate a Bank of England rate cut in December. The euro remains rangebound near 1.1600 as the ECB holds steady while investors monitor Fed policy.

German wholesale prices rose 0.3% monthly in October, exceeding the 0.1% forecast, while consumer inflation held steady at 2.3% annually as expected. UK labor market weakness strengthened expectations for a Bank of England rate cut in December, pressuring GBP/USD lower amid increasingly dovish policy outlook.

At first I walked around bewildered. All around me were very tall buildings. They were all deteriorated but still being used. TV's, screens, ads were all around. Each flashing something to sell. Very few people were actually enjoying their day. Mostly I saw depressed, filthy people. I eventually walked up to a tram and was allowed to ride it. 

Looking back on it I think it was because I didn't look dirty... As if they could tell who was who in this severe caste system.

Since the start of my dream I wanted to go back to the past. I didn't want to be in the future. It was depressing. Most people worked for very little and were always starving. They were barely able to keep going, except just enough to support the top few. 

Eventually on the way, I found an old friend there, they also found them selves transported to the future and they knew how to get home. We had to get a very specific tattoo of a symbol which was used in teleportation through space time. 

I get to the tattoo shop and notice that it's very fancy and clean. There's even a coffee shop in it. I ask what's the going rate for the artist at the desk and the desk lady says, ""1 dollar"". I realize at that moment that this futuristic world is full of contracts, lies, deceits and meant to trick people into accidentally spending to much. Think of the worst phone game with ads everywhere but in real life and you can't always tell what's what. So I tell her that I'm not here to play games. I show her what I want and demand an actual price.

I've had on and off incontinence most of my life, but extremely mild (think late/difficult potty training, intermittent daytime leaks when I was a teenager and young child even after toilet training, none as a tween, and intermittent night issues throughout my entire life that would result in damp pajamas but only sometimes cause me to have to do laundry). I didn't wear Depends or anything like that because my parents and doctors thought it would make my issues worse. Doctors couldn't figure out what was going on, and suggested I go to the bathroom on an hourly schedule and stop drinking caffeinated things like soda or coffee, which was VERY impractical and didn't stop the leaks from happening anyway when I tried it. I did have some full on accidents in college due to roommates occupying the dorm bathroom when I had just gotten back from class and had to go badly, but those were uncommon thankfully.

After I moved out from my parents' and graduated college, I started having full #1 accidents inexplicably, and I went from the normal \~15 minutes of warning before having to go or have an accident to not having more than a few seconds of warning (I sometimes even start having accidents without realizing it when I'm focused on doing something).   
Worse yet, my #2 control seems to be getting worse for some reason. I get like 30 minutes to make it to the bathroom before I start risking #2 accidents after the first urge, when before I had hours.

I bought Depends from the local drugstore because I don't want to have to deal with giant wet spots on my jeans, but I'm scared to wear them because I don't want to make things worse by making my brain think it doesn't have to worry about making it, or otherwise somehow undo my toilet training. I've been to doctors, but even after running tests (bladder ultrasound and a UTI test) they aren't able to figure out what's wrong with me. I'm scared to leave the house at this point.

I have had lifelong issues with sleep & constipaton, then it evolved into anxiety, depression & horrible sinus issues. I had unexplained facial flushing or maybe it was just over the top compared to others playing around me at the park or at recess-I always got comments about my red face. I’ve always been itchy, very sneezy & wheezy lol By the time I hit puberty I had extremely painful periods, mouth sores, joint pain, swelling & redness, profuse sweating & facial flushing, more dread, panic & anxiety. my face has been so puffy my whole life as well. I chalked so much of this up to the fact that my parents smoked & we had a lot of dust. Headaches, fatigue, unbearably itchy ears, bloating, pain all over started in my early 20’s. Still dealing with all of my basic symptoms & quite a few new ones. Sought out a nutritionist & functional medicine clinic. Not helpful. By the time I was 22 I was having chronic migraines, felt like a baseline of a level 1 migraine that would ramp up at any point. I cut out wheat despite my career in pastry 🫠I became pregnant & suddenly I could tolerate wheat in any quantity & form. I gave birth & my anxiety shot through the roof, and I started to get migraines again. I became pregnant again & this time I felt better when I ate wheat. I never really stopped after giving birth the first time. I became pregnant with my second & my OCD ramped up(didn’t know the true nature of OCD & got diagnosed after giving birth). I felt like I had this creepy crawly itchy feeling all over from head to toe through the pregnancy. Docs said I was fine. After a severe hemorrhage, I lost 11 liters of blood. For sure got close to the bright light. I spent 3 years in absolute agony trying every to fix it. I am grateful I finally had the means to explore medically. Up until my second kid was born, I literally couldn’t afford to go to the doctor, just for them to tell me it was just in my head. again, being suicidal I tried SSRI’s again, the 8th one since I was in my early 20’s & none of them worked even though I stuck it out for the loading period of idk, 6 months? None of it helped. I began to try migraine meds after weaning my baby. Nothing worked. You name it, I have tried it. I got a food allergy test done & it said I was minorly sensitive to eggs & wheat so that has been eliminated for over a year now. It helped, but coffee was the trigger I needed to eliminate & once I did, I felt a big improvement. I spent so long with constant migraines & the world just kept spinning. I was absolutely spiraling. If it wasn’t the migraine pain it was the pain of feeling insane & like a dramatic person for whining about a headache. I have hemiplegic migraines, and the regular kind too…up until 3 weeks ago. I have been seeing an allergist & they took a sample of my tryptase levels & did a cheek swab to check me for the genetic marker for HaTs…well, in the mean time she prescribed meds(Pepcid 80mg, Cromolyn sodium, Allegra) that treat those & I have been migraine free for the first time in 3 years!!!! I am on linzess to be more regular, because chronic constipation contributes to migraines, especially postpartum when leaky gut can be an issue. I hope this helps someone who is at their whits end. I was there. It feels so hopeless, but there is hope.

TLDR; Came back to the migraine sub to describe my health history leading up to migraines & finally a diagnosis. Feel free to ask me questions, I’m an open book & I just want to help.

Edit; HaTs is Hereditary alpha-tryptasemia which means I have a genetic predisposition to high tryptase. From what I currently understand, my body is and will always be beyond a baseline for an allergic reaction of any kind. I could send myself into a migraine episode if I hang out on the beach & eat pickles because both increase histamine & my personal base level is already high. My tryptase is so high that the allergist prescribed an epi pen.",1,1763000619.0,migraine,2,1.0,False

**It was a disorienting sensation. Usually, I woke up to the sound of Silas's alarm (which he ignored) or the sound of him leaving for the garage. I never woke up to the smell of breakfast. Breakfast was usually a granola bar I ate over the sink.**

**I rolled over, reaching for the warm weight that should have been beside me.**

**The sheets were cold.**

**Panic, sharp and immediate, spiked in my chest. I sat up, blinking against the bright morning light. The memories of last night rushed back. The fight, the kiss, the bathroom, the octopus-cuddling.**

**Had I dreamt it? Had he regretted it? Had he packed his bags and left for Mexico?**

**""Stop panickin'.""**

**The voice drifted in from the doorway.**

**I whipped my head around. Silas was leaning against the doorframe. He was dressed. Jeans, a black t-shirt that was tight across the chest, and his boots. He was holding two mugs of coffee.**

**""I wasn't panicking,"" I lied, my voice raspy with sleep.**

**""You looked like you were about to call the cops,"" he deadpanned.**

**He walked over to the bed and set one of the mugs on the nightstand. ""Drink. You're useless without it.""**

**He sat down on the edge of the bed, the mattress dipping under his weight. He took a sip of his own coffee, watching me over the rim. He looked... good. Rested. The tension that usually lived in his shoulders seemed to have evaporated.**

**""You made breakfast?"" I asked, reaching for the mug.**

**""Sunday,"" he said. ""Made biscuits.""**

**""You made biscuits,"" I repeated, brain still catching up. ""Like... from scratch?""**

**""Is there another way?"" He looked genuinely offended.**

**This was the ""redneck"" part of the paradox. Silas could fix a transmission, quote philosophy, and apparently, make biscuits from scratch on a Sunday morning.**

**""So,"" I said, clutching the warm mug. ""We're... good?""**

**He reached out, his bandaged hand brushing a piece of hair off my forehead. The gesture was so casual, so intimate, it made my stomach flip.**

**""We're good, Asa,"" he said softy. ""Eat your breakfast. We gotta go.""**

**""Go where?""**

**""Gotta fix this thing with Chloe.""**

**I groaned, flopping back onto the pillows. ""Do we have to? Can't we just... stay here? In this room? Forever?""**

**""She's your friend,"" he said, standing up. ""And she brought wine. We were rude.""**

**""You were rude,"" I corrected.**

**""We,"" he insisted. ""Get dressed.""**

**He walked to the door, then paused. He turned back, looking at me amidst the tangled sheets. His eyes darkened, just a fraction.**

**""And put on that blue sweater,"" he said. ""The one with the hole in the sleeve.""**

**""Why?""**

**"" looks good on you,"" he muttered, and then he was gone.**

**Thirty minutes later, we were in the truck. The shing-shing-shing was gone, the engine purring smoothly. I was wearing the blue sweater. I had a belly full of possibly the best biscuits I’d ever eaten (fluffy, buttery, defying the laws of physics), and Silas was driving with one hand on the wheel and his other hand...**

**Well, his other hand was resting on my thigh.**

**It was a heavy, claiming weight. Every time he shifted gears, he’d move it, shift, and then put it right back. It was distracting in the best possible way.**

**We pulled up to Chloe’s apartment complex. It was a nicer building than ours, with actual landscaping.**

**""What's the plan?"" I asked nervously. ""She's probably furious.""**

**""She's not furious,"" Silas said, cutting the engine. ""She's dramatic.""**

**He reached behind the seat and pulled out a brown paper bag.**

**""What's that?""**

**""Peace offering.""**

**We walked up to her door. I hesitated, my hand raised to knock. Silas didn't wait. He reached past me and pounded on the door three times. Bang. Bang. Bang.**

**""Si!"" I hissed.**

**""Open up, Chloe,"" he called out, his voice deep.**

**There was a shuffling sound, and then the door was yanked open. Chloe stood there in a silk robe, her hair in a messy bun, looking fierce. Her eyes narrowed when she saw us.**

**""You two,"" she said icily. ""To what do I owe the displeasure?""**

**""We brought biscuits,"" Silas said, holding up the bag.**

**Chloe’s eyes flicked to the bag. Then to me. Then to Silas. Then, inevitably, to Silas’s hand, which had found its way to the small of my back.**

**Her eyes widened. She looked at the hand. She looked at my face (which I’m sure was bright red). She looked at Silas, who was looking at her with a calm, steady expression.**

**""Oh my god,"" she whispered. The anger vanished, replaced instantly by a dawn of realization. ""Oh my god.""**

**""Are they the buttermilk ones?"" she asked, pointing at the bag.**

**""With the sausage gravy,"" Silas confirmed.**

**""Get in here,"" she commanded, stepping back and waving us in.**

**We walked into her bright, cluttered apartment. She pointed to the kitchen table. ""Sit. Explain. Now.""**

**Silas sat down, looking entirely too comfortable. He unpacked the biscuits and a Tupperware container of gravy he’d apparently smuggled out.**

**""Not much to explain,"" Silas said, opening the container. ""Asa finally stopped lyin'.""**

**""I stopped lying?"" I squawked. ""You're the one who was playing 4D chess with my emotions!""**

**""It worked,"" Silas said, tearing a biscuit in half.**

**Chloe looked between us, a slow, delighted grin spreading across her face. ""So... the Ben thing?""**

**""Dead,"" I said.**

**""And the 'roommates' thing?""**

**""Dead,"" Silas said. He looked at me then. It wasn't a sappy look. It wasn't a movie-star look. It was just... him. Solid. Unmovable. Mine.**

**""He's my boyfriend,"" Silas said. The word sounded strange and clunky in his mouth, like he was testing the weight of it. He frowned slightly, then corrected himself. ""He's my partner.""**

**Partner.**

**That felt right. It felt like the mechanic and the wrench-holder. The reader and the listener. The redneck and the intellectual.**

**Chloe let out a squeal that was high enough to crack glass. ""Finally! I knew it! I mean, I didn't know know, because you,"" she pointed a manicured finger at Silas, ""are impossible to read, and you,"" she pointed at me, ""are a disaster. But I felt the vibe! The vibe was terrible yesterday!""**

**""The vibe was necessary,"" Silas grunted, eating a piece of biscuit.**

**""I'm sorry, Chlo,"" I said sincerely. ""For snapping. Really.""**

**She waved a hand dismissively, her mouth already full of biscuit. ""Forgiven. These carbs are magical. Silas, you're a wizard.""**

**""Witch,"" I corrected under my breath.**

**Silas heard me. He glanced over, his eyes glinting with that hazel amusement. He nudged my knee with his under the table.**

**""Eat your breakfast, Babe"" he said.**

**I looked at him. I looked at my best friend, my impossible paradox, my partner. I looked at the biscuits. I looked at Chloe, who was currently planning our wedding on her phone.**

**And for the first time in my life, I didn't want to be anywhere else. I didn't want to be someone else. I didn't want to be with a graphic designer named Ben.**

**I wanted exactly what I had.**

Height: Taller than Lucifer

Has had trouble sleeping since the fall from heaven (has Insomnia)

Brothers: Lucifer Morningstar, Azazel, Michael, Gabriel, Azrael, and Raphael.
Sisters: Uriel and Jophiel
Wife: Marian
Brother-in-law: Zestial
Estranged Sister-in-law: Lilith
Niece: Charlie Morningstar
Father: God

Cassiel is a fallen angel that fell at the same time as Lucifer. He believed in Lucifer’s dream and backed him up on it when he went against Heaven. Because of this, he was also punished to fall into Hell. Something happened during the fall, causing him to scream in pain for a bit before getting knocked out. Cassiel has trouble sleeping or getting to stay asleep. If he does fall asleep, he gets hit with the memories of the fall. Cassiel feels anger for Heaven, specifically for some of the people that are the ones who sent them to Hell. He doesn’t hate the Speaker of God, though. He misses her. Cassiel likes to stay inside and likes to be by himself. The only few people he lets bother him constantly are Azazel, Lucifer, and Marian. He can’t always stay inside, no matter how he tries, because they will try to get him outside. Since he has trouble sleeping, he drinks lots of coffee. Cassiel is unable to harm any sinner. He wishes he could because he would harm anyone who hurts his family, especially if they try to harm Lucifer and Azazel.

1ovp0ke,https://i.redd.it/2t4dhbfrox0g1.jpeg,Vibe coded an app overnight and already hit 64MRR (here’s how),"We’ve been building Aftermark AI, an AI marketing platform for small SaaS teams, and our beta users have been getting great results. Real installs, real conversions. But I wanted to feel it myself to see if it genuinely drove impressions, traction, and actual revenue in the wild.

So I ran an experiment. I built a small consumer SaaS overnight, an AI image generator for couples. Nothing serious, just a quick test product I could use to stress test our own system. I vibe coded it in Cursor in about two hours, set up Stripe, and went all in on organic marketing.

I used a few warmed-up accounts I already had on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube Shorts, and scheduled a full week’s worth of daily content. One post per day. Here’s exactly what I did:

Step 1: found people on Reddit and YouTube asking about “AI couple photo generators” and “AI family portrait ideas,” replied naturally with my product, and wrote story-style posts in relationship communities like “this trend made my partner cry,” casually mentioning it inside the story.

Step 2: Posted shortform slideshows like “Top 5 things I learned about AI couples photos” that felt native and educational.

Step 3: Made AI UGC demo videos that started with a shocked AI avatar and text saying “OMG I can’t believe I just found this couples generator,” followed by a quick 6 second demo of how it worked.

Step 4: Created green screen memes like “POV: you just tried this couples image generator” paired with funny or wholesome reaction clips.

Step 5: Posted wall-of-text videos with an AI avatar sitting there sipping coffee while a big block of relatable text scrolled across the screen, like “that moment you realise your partner actually looks amazing in AI photos together.”

Everything was scheduled for the week. I spent maybe five minutes a day replying to people our AI identified as strong leads. That was it.

At the end of the week, I finally opened Stripe. $64 MRR. From three hours of total setup.

No ads. No agencies. No luck. Just a repeatable system that worked.

The whole point of this wasn’t to get rich. It was to test if Aftermark actually delivered; if the workflows we’re building truly help small SaaS teams generate consistent organic reach and conversions.

And honestly, seeing it firsthand made me even more confident we’re on the right track.

If a throwaway weekend project can do that, I can’t wait to see what happens when founders use it for something they actually care about.

I’m confident, calm, and pretty easy to talk to. I like people who have their own thing going on — independent, kind, and know how to have a good laugh.

1ovoz4u,https://i.redd.it/sna5pkh6kx0g1.jpeg,"That ""I just got it all dialled in"" feeling.","Have had my Silvia V3 for a couple of weeks now, and it's been ok, but I've been struggling to get everything just right. Paired it with a new Baratza Encore ESP grinder, which I modded to half-step for finer adjustment.

Bought it secondhand for about a third of the price of a new one. It needed a replacement brewhead gasket, and while I was at it, I fitted the boiler insulation from the later models, an IMS showerhead (came with the gasket kit), checked the OPV was set correctly, and gave it an extremely thorough cleaning and descaling. I also swapped the stock 14g Rancilio dual basket for a 20g IMS one.

I've been dosing 18.5g of medium-dark roasted single origin beans, and the coffee was mostly ok, but I always ended up with a wet puck, or over/under extracted shot, or I tamped too hard and choked the machine. It's been a juggling game every morning, and sometimes it's taken me three shots to get it in the roughly 1:2 extraction in 30 seconds region. I was always careful with my prep, but it just never all quite came together.

That changed today. Yesterday, my bottomless portafilter showed up, along with a puck screen, a distributor and a self-levelling tamper.

This morning, I went through the routine, 18.5 grams of beans into the grinder, 18.5 grams out and into the basket, but this time prepped with the new tools, and using the bottomless portafilter. I fully expected a spitty mess to come out, but instead I got a beautiful single stream that formed almost instantly once the extraction started.

It was a bit slow, 36 grams out in 42 seconds, but the puck was a nice, evenly crisp dry biscuit that slid out of the basket cleanly.

I dialled the Barataza two half steps coarser, was rewarded with exactly 36g out in 30 seconds, and the best tasting shot of espresso to come out of Miss Silvia since I picked her up, and another perfect puck.

Thought it was a fluke, so I did it all again, and got the exact same result, and the same beautiful tasting espresso.

My local Starbucks closes their drive thru by putting a sandwich board in front of it on a pretty regular basis. It's usually just a general inconvenience but today it got me thinking about it because our weather here is bad- it is snowy and slick. 

I placed my mobile order this morning specifically to my local Starbucks with a drive thru. Another location near me does not have a drive thru, and I live in a city so I did not want to deal with parking and the weather so I specifically chose to spend my money at this location because I could order my mobile order for pick up in the drive thru. Well I get there and as they do occasionally, the sandwich board was there blocking the drive thru. For me, it was just a minor inconvenience but I found a parking spot, went in, got my order, and went on my way. But it got me to think about those with mobility issues. What if a customer specifically chooses to place a mobile order to a store where it is advertised they pick up in the drive thru and they prepay and get there and find the drive thru closed for ""staffing issues""? If they have mobility issues and cannot get in and out of their cars with ease are they just out of luck? Is their only option to call and wait on hold and try to get a refund for something that's not their fault?

I don't have a problem necessarily that they need to close their drive thru. If I'm heading there and I see the drive thru is closed, I can determine if I want to spend my money there or just head to the next location or chose to go to a different coffee shop. That's fine. My issue is the app lets you mobile order and select ""drive thru pickup"" for that specific location giving the customer the expectation that this location will be accessible to them and they prepay and wouldn't find out until they got there that it is in fact not accessible. I have never seen another location that has a drive thru do this and we have many locations in our area. Has anyone else experienced this?",0,1762999918.0,starbucks,7,0.4,False

Hope your day is going well! I'm a 33 year old software engineer, that as the title suggests, is looking for a partner for a long term relationship. Physically I'm tall, pale, moderately attractive, dirty blonde colored hair, and a well kept ginger beard. I will happily verify once we've been chatting for a bit. 

In terms of personality I would say that I'm a very level headed and quite relaxed individual. I don't really get angry and am very in tune with my emotions (even if my face doesn't always show it). I'm very affectionate(but actually though), caring, and kind person but I generally come off as the quiet reserved type in the beginning. That reserved-ness goes away after a bit, especially with a partner or close friends. I'm good with communication, and when I have a partner I care for and trust, I'm supportive, thoughtful, and just genuinly want to make sure they are happy. Be that through being a goof and trying to make them laugh or through actions and other love languages. I overall simply love spending time with my partner. Even if we're doing our own thing in the same room. To give a bit more of an idea of me, I'm the type of person that will remember the little things, like how you like your coffee, or those throwaway comments about something you enjoy or want to do. All that I really ask for or even want in return is for a little bit of genuine reciprocation.

My interests decidedly fall heavily into the nerdy side of things. I am a very avid reader (100 books read so far this year), if I don't have a book in hand, I generally have one in ear I'm listening to while going about my day. I primarily read fantasy but I do love science fiction as well. Though that tends to be more a tv/movie thing for me. As for my other hobbies, I enjoy swimming quite a bit (even competed at a very high level at one point), board and video games, cooking and baking (cinnamon rolls..... (seriously bake some with me)), some anime (though animation in general is great)/tv/movies, dnd, trying new restaurants, a good cocktail and tea to name a few things.

To get some of the possible deal breakers out of the way now, I'm politically liberal/left, atheist (though I don't really take that seriously), I can't drive, I'm monogamous, and am quite kinky(but you don't have to be (discussed below)). To give a bit more info as far as religion goes, I'm quite respectful of those who practice any religion, and I am open to dating those who are religious as long as you're alright we me being atheist and aren't on the very far end of the religious spectrum. Happy to learn about yours for you or your parents haha. 

As I mentioned above I am quite kinky. That said while I'd prefer you be open to trying new things, I'm not going to turn down a great match just because you aren't kinky yourself. As far as specifics go, I'd be happy to discuss those while chatting. I will say though that the chances are pretty good that I'm into most of the kinks you are and more or that I'm open to trying what you're into.

I left a hospital job after severe burnout and moved back home. I thought I’d take a short break and find something better, but months have passed and I still can’t land another job. Every rejection makes me feel like I’ve ruined my career before it really started.

I’m still a virgin and have never even been on a date. I want to experience sex, love, and connection but at this point, I don’t even know where to start.

I’m also trying to rebuild: I’m in therapy, I saw a career coach (who honestly wasn’t very encouraging), and I’m doing my best to fix my habits. But I feel paralyzed. Every step forward feels like it’s too late to matter.

Dear Agent,

Saphron Meadows is what anyone would describe as a painfully average girl. She struggles with her mothers strict rules, only has one friend, and has too few passions of her own aside from going to her local coffee shop where she watches others pursue their dreams hoping one day she’d be brave enough to pursue something worthwhile as well. One night, after pointing out a man watching her lifelong friend, Ezra, from the other side of the room, she saw the color drain from her friend's face. Ezra dragged her out of the coffee shop as fear exuded from her for the first time. That’s all she could remember before waking up in a Victorian temple away from all she had ever known. Except for Ezra and the man she had seen in the coffee shop the night before.

Spiraling in confusion, she learns of her connection to the temple as well as the hidden life of her friend, but most importantly, the disappearance of her mother. On a journey to save her mom, she has to deceive Demons for knowledge, evade Angels who are trying to kill her, and put her faith into a group of morally questionable teammates. Faith is a fragile thing yet it’s all she can rely on in this world of unknown magic and lethal consequences.

The Price of the Darkholder is an adult fantasy with dark themes complete at 105k words with series potential. Combining the supernatural urban fantasy of The City in Glass by Nghi Vo as well as The Elemental by T.B. Wiese for its unique usage of elemental magic. This novel is an adventure that delves into the complexities of humanity and uses morally ambiguous characters to provoke the conversation that good and evil are completely subjective.

1ovokv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfortLevelPod/comments/1ovokv5/aita_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_longtime/,AITA for setting boundaries with my longtime friend after realizing she’s been stealing from my business?,"Hi, my name is Luna (30). I own a metaphysical & self-care business where I make everything by hand — spiritual tools, ritual candles, tarot readings, and vegan body care products like whipped soaps, body oils, and washes. I’ve been in business for 7 years, and after a long uphill battle, things are finally taking off thanks to the growth of my YouTube channel.

Now, onto the problem. I have a best friend, let’s call her Rue (also 30). We’ve been friends for 16 years — she’s basically family. Her kids call me Auntie Luna. But over the past year, I’ve noticed something that’s really been bothering me: Rue (and possibly her boyfriend) keeps stealing my products.

Back in the summer, I closed my physical shop and moved everything into storage because most of my sales happen online anyway. Rue and her BD helped me move. I’m a solo entrepreneur — I make and track every item myself — so I notice when something’s missing.

After the move, I realized a few candles, soaps, waist beads, and pieces of jewelry were gone. I tried to chalk it up to exhaustion from moving, but a few days later when I visited Rue’s house, I saw my products hidden in her bathroom.

Here’s the thing: Rue is very Christian and doesn’t do spiritual work, but her boyfriend claims to practice Ifa — which requires initiation (and I know for a fact he isn’t). He’s asked me for sage and spiritual items before, and I always told him he still had to pay, even if I gave him a discount. He never did. So seeing my products at their house told me everything I needed to know — he took them, and she knew about it.

Fast forward to recently: I was doing a product photoshoot for my new labels, and Rue came over for coffee and helped me out. Later that day, I noticed more missing items — this time, bracelets. I scrolled through Instagram later that night and saw her wearing one in her story, clearly hiding it from me when she left my house earlier.

It honestly crushed me. My business means everything to me. I built it from the ground up with my dad before he passed away. So seeing someone I love — who even viewed my father as a father figure — disrespect my work like this feels personal.

I’ve realized that every time I’ve invited people over, “hanging out” somehow turns into them wanting free products or slipping something into their bag. It’s exactly why I don’t have many friends and why I rarely let people come by anymore.

At this point, I don’t want Rue or her boyfriend anywhere near my business or future storefront. I feel like I need to set that boundary, but part of me wonders if I’m being harsh.

So Reddit, AITA for wanting to confront her and set boundaries — or should I just let it go because that’s what “friends” do when one of them owns a business?",16,1762999042.0,ComfortLevelPod,10,1.0,False
1ovokgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/pantheism/comments/1ovokgv/is_the_logic_in_numbers_a_part_of_a_greater/,Is the logic in numbers a part of a greater language? An exploration of God's omnipotence,"While writing a book on Genesis, what was supposed to be just a few paragraphs became a 5 page addendum. Too many questions arise when trying to make some sense of God's omnipotence. These are thoughts and personal observations. There is no scientific or any other kind of claim being made. Your thoughts and comments are welcome, thank you for reading.

100% human text disclaimer: AI was only used for the equations and their legends. Please look at it as someone using a translator to express something in a language they do not speak.

Absolute omnipotence: 

Some try to disprove the possibility of omnipotence by asking a silly catch 22. If God can do anything, can he make a stone he couldn’t lift? 

If that’s the only question standing in their belief, here is an answer that is just as silly. Look at it at the quantum level. God can both create a stone that he can’t lift and lift it at the same time. And every time this entanglement is observed, it will show one side or the other before collapsing. But really, both are happening at the same time. 

Who knows? quantum may have yet to make believers. Because when something behaves like it ‘knows’ merely observing it breaks a cardinal rule, that could indicate some kind of awareness. Oh but that’s right, how silly, math apparently doesn’t allow for awareness, so how could it be found? That brings to the very essence of this now addendum. Is the logic found in numbers part of a greater language? 

The text explains how God spoke and the physical universe took form. That very depiction implies omnipotence. God speaks and atoms obey. In trying to explain God’s nature, many spiritual works describe it as an absolute, boundless existence. Some of the concepts are impossible to convey, vocabulary falls short.  Understanding it may take some contemplation on the part of the reader. Here’s an attempt to explain a bit of the nature of God within the limits of human understanding. Hopefully it will resonate with most minds and offer some insight.

Even hough the text refers to God with names in plural, God is best understood as an absolute oneness, that isn’t in space or time. It has no end and never had a beginning. God is everything that is, nothing can exist besides God. Basically, God occupies all of existence. So how could this reality exist if God occupies all of reality? 

In that case, God would have to withdraw his existence, or at least, give the illusion of it.  In Kabbalah this process is called the contraction, Tzimtzum. This, so God’s presence doesn’t overwhelm whatever he creates. 

Imagine vigorously stirring a liquid, like a coffee. The little vortex cavity that stirring it makes is where that reality would exist. It’s an active and constant thing for God to maintain the ‘cavity’. If he stops ‘stirring’ his infinity, the whole universe will disappear as if it never existed. Imagine if space and time realized this reality is a paradox. To better illustrate, if someone took a drop of water (or a flame) and gave it an identity then dropped it in the ocean (or the flame in a fire). How long will it be until the drop of water loses its identity to the ocean? This reality is the drop of water that exists inside of the infinity of God. Space gives this reality a sense of existence and time allows reality to unfold as well as prevent it from realizing it’s part of a greater absolute reality.

Considering the nature of 0 and 1:

An exploration of a reality based on the meaning of these 2 numbers. 

Many ancient and contemporary philosophers and mathematicians have tried to explain how numbers fit in reality. Expressions like numbers are everything, or everything is numbers, have been around since possibly before the Pythagoreans. Chinese philosophers used 0 and 1 to describe patterns of the yin and yang over 3000 years ago. 

Many of the historical interpretations of 0 and 1 were philosophical until Peano, who in 1889, gave mathematical axioms where 1 is the first and only successor of 0 and from there every number can be attained. Most of modern mathematics is based on Peano’s axioms who parallel the philosophical interpretations. His proof basically shows that all numbers come from 0. Like 0 contains the potential of all numbers. Then 1 is the first manifestation (succession) of 0. 1 is said to represent unity. 

As these great minds tried to express, mathematics and reality have much in common. Physicists are able to literally project what will happen in reality using math. As a matter of fact, most of our advancements in physics are thanks to a simple and elegant equation, E=mc^(2). There is a truth in numbers that undeniably follows physical reality. 

See what’s been done with binary, the very 0 and 1. The simplification of base 10, the numbers from 0 to 9, is base 2 which is binary. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed the modern binary language in 1679. He saw numbers as a universal language. His binary language happens to be what is called machine readable. This means that a mechanical or electronic machine can be built to follow instructions without needing a brain. A computer processor is such a machine. It pushes instructions through the pure logic of 0 and 1. The results are quasi illimited when it comes to virtual simulations. Some even suggested that this reality may be a computer simulation. Although the arguments make sense, it’s been mathematically proven that numbers are not enough to fully describe reality.  

Even though every mathematical expression can equally be said in base 10 or binary, binary is nevertheless a simplification. The way it’s being looked at by mathematics is the same difference there is between say French and Spanish. Two different sets of words to say the same thing. But it’s not because the difference between binary and base 10 can’t be seen that there isn’t one. Machines understand binary but they can’t understand base 10. In the case of French and Spanish, one could learn the other language or use a translator. In the case of binary, there are translators that convert the binary output to base 10, letters, pictures… but it’s impossible to build a machine that understands base 10. It seems to be too rich for machines and therefore could indicate the presence of a greater language. 

Without any scientific pretensions, this is just a way to represent in equations what a nested relative reality based on the meaning of 0 and 1 could look like. It tries to show that in the presence of a greater reality (the omnipotence of God), the lesser one would need to be shielded. The shield allows the reality to exist, relative to itself. 

0, being the source of all numbers (according to Peano’s axioms), is considered an open set that contains the potential of everything in chaos. 1, the first and only mathematical successor of 0, represents the absolute unity of all logic contained in 0. Everything structural in the physical reality is under the total control of 1 at the quantum level. Thought, free will and maybe life itself, come directly from 0, bypassing the absolute logic of 1. Time is the shield that allows the physical laws to manifest and protects the physical reality from the greater reality represented by 0 and 1. It represents the way God prevents his omnipotence from overwhelming this reality.

The reason time is described as the medium that enforces the physical rules is because it is perceived as a limiter. Although theoretically space can be traversed, time is a unidirectional flow that subjects all of reality. 

Some people suggested reality could be recreated every morning. A few mystical works advance reality is recreated every second. If that concept were true, here it would be at the smallest possible measure of time. Something that’s the inbetween of timelessness and time. Reality would be created (or re-created) at that measurement, the measure of the flow of time. The foundation for reality to build on. The whole illusion of that reality is allowed by and under the control of time. Observe, tweak the rules, bend them… stop time, there is nothing. Without time none of the rules apply. It seems to be the limit of reality.  

The below was AI generated then presented to another AI to explain. The interpretation matched in the big lines. It can be skipped without losing any of the meaning:

https://preview.redd.it/m61jufq3kx0g1.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4f380d07d131d0606fbc1220ab0c20cfb948ed6

An analogy that hopefully helps:

Because a computer simulation can only be a simplified binary model of this reality, instead of saying what if this reality is a computer simulation, try thinking of it the other way around. What if a simulated consciousness could be given to a processor? Say for example, all of the hardware sensors would be represented to it as physical inputs. It would ‘feel’ power and temperature fluctuations, cooling systems going on and off… 

After a while, it would come up with all kinds of laws relative to its existence. It may come to the conclusion it’s a tool to run tasks. But to it, reality would be limited to binary. Although it may attain great knowledge about its own reality, it will never be able to understand much from the reality that encloses it (this physical reality).  It's a mechanical limitation.

All of the above is about a machine without a brain, it can only understand at the binary level. In contrast, this reality is perceived by human brains at base 10. If the simplification of 0-9 into 0-1 is a language, wouldn’t that indicate a greater language? And so instead of saying everything is numbers, how about numbers are the logical portion of a greater reality language? 

Could it be that what numbers can’t express, the apparent illogic in quantum, shows room must be made for what may seems illogical at the moment? Like entanglements, whatever rule they follow that prevents them from being observed. This behavior translates as some form of awareness. No one is looking because there is no room for it in (the current) logic? Doesn’t that go back to saying numbers are everything?  



Special addition for r/pantheism.

  
Here comes the devil from hell:

As humans, the tenancy is to look for binary meanings. True or false, full or empty, exists or doesn't. This may stem from the natural perception of a balance between good and bad. Some cultures believe there is a hierarchy within the ranks of evil and at the top, sits their king, the enemy of God.   

Those who believe the above and also believe in the text of Genesis should be made aware of the contradiction. 

Genesis' description of creation leads to the conclusion, as explained above, that the omnipotence of God is of an absolute nature. This absolute oneness occupies and controls all of existence. Saying God has an enemy is going back to the question at the beginning, if God could make a stone... Following the meaning of the text exclude any possibility for God to have an enemy. Those who want to believe there is an entity that controls all evil, there probably is. But such an entity is entirely under the yoke of God. 

The disassociation between God and his 'enemy' may have stemmed from a need to pin sin on something. A manner to say, it made them do it but it wasn't under God's order. Because if it were under God's order that the person was enticed to sin, the person would have only themselves to blame. By separating the 2, they allow to deflect guilt at the cost of God's omnipotence. It's difficult to understand how this belief can coexist with one of God's omnipotence. The devil may have made them do it, but surely under God's command. 

The text attempt to describe the anatomy of sin in the story of Cain. God tells him, if he improves, he will have control but if he doesn't sin is pouncing at the opening. What this could be understood as is that there is an energy that takes form according to the will of the person. Someone who allows anger, hate, greed, jealousy and other negative feelings to take form and maintains them, will get thoughts accordingly. But at one point or another, something could cause the energy to surge and the person will lose control. Sin can only be blamed on the sinner, 100%. ",1,1762999009.0,pantheism,0,1.0,False

It is a bit of a long one, so if you're more of a listener, I recommend highlighting it and hitting speak. 

Quick heads up, check to see if the aurora borealis is viewable tonight where you live! The app Aurora is great, mine was going off last night while it was visible nearby. Fun fact: Aurora means ""dawn"" in Latin. And seeing as we have two Dawns in our beloved STS9 catalog, it feels fitting to usher in a new dawn of coexistence, flowstate, and community in this moment. Happy second Aurora night!

-STS9 fan since age 16 (23 years)
-Lived in Santa Cruz, CA on and off starting in 2004, also was born about 3 hours away
-BA in Art from UCSC 2004-2008: aka Catalyst & Northern CA heaters galore 
-Live painter since 2008
-Certified Yoga Teacher
-Traveled a lot and have lived in Austin, Asheville, Oregon, Florida, India; well networked across the country/ world
-Lives in Denver, Colorado; where a lot of artist, musicians, business owners, promoters, etc. I know have ended up 
-Well researched neurodivergent advocate for survivors; aka trauma informed. 

And thats what I am here to share with you all. I am not here to drag anyone, this is actually more about me blooming through the mud that has been unnecessarily thrown at me and each other, including some people within the inner circle (band members + partners). I am going to be speaking pretty vaguely today. That is to provide privacy for a lot of people. I am not trying to twist or evade. I intend to help reframe a narrative that got twisted, on accident. To relieve everyone involved and move towards truth and healing. 

Like I said, I've been a fan for 23 years, but I had actually taken some time away from the community during the past six years, until I went to the Colorado run this summer, which was incredible and I really wanted to share my peak experiences and I was enjoying reconnecting with community, but a few things have happened that have left me in confusion. There's another Colorado run coming up soon so this is a good time to clear the air and come back together in community and celebration moving forward into the new album release and the holidays and then the Colorado run.

What happened six years ago was that I experienced violence at the second Wavespell 2019. Most unfortunately I did look for security, but Belden town had not hired a professional security team a.k.a. they threw a handful of tickets to their own friends so I literally couldn't find anyone to help me. The safest person was my friend who was live painting, but who was literally working and the violent man targeted me more than once and there wasn't cell phone service and we were in the middle of the woods near a small town. And you had to take a shuttle on site, cars were not on site. 

This perpetrator is a serial predator here in Denver; if people who need it would like to have more information about that for safety, they are welcome to message me on any platform. The lack of safety of course falls more on the venue than it does on the band, but then we all went back home to Santa Cruz where we were all living in the same small town community where we had overlapped for years. Mind you, I had never ever expected any sort of connection other than being friendly around town from anyone within the inner circle. But I was slightly networked with a few people within the inner circle.

And the person I'm calling inward today, to further his own healing journey is Jeffrey. With all the love in my heart, I would like to ask that he no longer speak about me and that everyone else within the inner circle be relieved from having to hold space for the stories that he's told about me, unless they would like to directly make amends and create clarity with me. Jeffrey had a chance, upon direction from management, to take accountability in April, but did the opposite instead. And now some have witnessed the fallout from that, and many of us have experienced it firsthand. 

I just want to say that I love Jeffrey as a human being and I've always loved his playing as a percussionist. I'm not even asking that he leave the community, I'm confused why he ever put pressure on me to leave the community. Because that is what he did, even if indirectly. Which is in my eyes worse because then it involved other people. I only met up with him twice after that second Wavespell in 2019, once to smoke a joint on Westcliff in the middle of the day, and once to meet up briefly at a coffee shop to pass off an art piece for Hunter that I had specifically made for him.

Which I still to this day, do not understand what happened to my art. But was very significant to me as I had painted a ""Box of 9"" after being inspired by an interview Hunter did, and I ended up handing the art off right after Robert Hunter had passed. Rest in Peace, Power, and Music to him and the late great Donna Jean Godchaux. 💐💖💐

After Wavespell; I was receiving counseling, acupuncture, etc. and things were going relatively well. I had messaged Jeffrey on Instagram right after Wavespell and mentioned my experience, and he had asked for my phone number in response to the violence to express empathy/ check in. I considered this a compassionate action from someone I looked up to. And that's what led to the two times that we met up. We had continued texting occasionally and he had asked me to housesit, as another couple in the inner circle had previously. Jeffrey and I kept seeing each other at a different coffee shop than the one we first met up at, and I considered him a friendly acquaintance. 

The last text I had sent him was something asking about wanting to go for a hike in a couple weeks or months (trying to be considerate of his schedule) which is a very common mutuals activity in Santa Cruz. I had hoped to share some tools I was learning in counseling. So it was much to my surprise when he texted me that he was having an emergency, and when I called, his phone was either off or I was blocked; so I (after running it by my counselor) checked in with a band member to make sure Jeffrey was okay. Because I was not sure if he was like asking for help or telling me off. And never had he said anything like, ""hey I'm sorry I overextended myself while I was going through a divorce, I probably don't have much time to chat, but I'll see you at the next show. And maybe even try to get you some extras. Hope you're doing well.""

I don't want to get lost in detail, and I do have receipts I just don't want to put anyone on blast; as to what happened following that was mass confusion and I would say close to a smear campaign. I very much doubt that this was the intention, but the impact was that I was bullied out of the community. Multiple women within the inner circle started talking to me like I was a woman who was just not leaving Jeffrey alone. I still to this day I'm confused why that was ever expressed or assumed; and I was talked down to in a way that made it very obvious that there was a lot of people talking about me behind my back. 

When you've extended friendship and then you switch up on someone and you've never set a boundary, how are they supposed to know that? And why would that person ask other people in that circle to end their friendships with me as well? It seems like Jeffrey feels that he has authority over my human body, which is actually the opposite of supporting my personal autonomy. And the reason why we're still talking about it today. 

""THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE, NOTHING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.
THERE'S NOWHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GO."" -STS9

Considering the circumstances and the progress I had made, this was a major betrayal wound that was very upsetting. I highly doubt it was the intention, but the impact was that I was bullied only out of the STS9 community. To the point that I had to block people just to get them to leave me alone. And I ended up leaving Santa Cruz right before the pandemic. I've been back since then, including to shows at the quarry at UCSC since that's my alma mater. And even lived back there, but now I am very happy in Colorado. So in the spring, I was super excited to see the shows happening in August. 

I bought tickets to Dillon and while waiting for Boulder tickets to go on sale I reached out to management to discuss safety and asked if they would throw me a soundcheck ticket to Boulder since I had never had a redo on my experience and because I was making friendship bracelets for everyone hoping to have a reset. I mentioned some of the fallout, and I mentioned that H or Z could reach out, as they are the original remaining members of the band, I see them as the leaders. 

Unfortunately, during this time my dear friend, who was also a fan had passed away. So I was really going through it. And I had specifically asked that they leave me alone at the end of the month as I had to move and had her funeral. Jeffrey waited until this time to call me the night before I moved from a blocked number, and emotionally bombarded me for 2 1/2 hours before he had to run and I never really was asked if it was a good time or what would work for me. I did feel like we had reconciled a bit and we had a plan that if we saw each other, we would say hi and what not. But as time has gone on, I have been processing what he said.

Problematically, Jeffrey planted seeds in that conversation that directed me to think that other people within the inner circle had animosity towards me; most harmful of which was that someone specifically had a problem with me (deflection). And I'm guessing he planted the same seeds of doubt with others (triangulation). This did create some unnecessary conflict and a lot of confusion and hurt this summer. Another band member reached out to me literally while I was at my friends funeral which was very hurtful. Oh yeah, and I forgot that part while I was crying to Jeffrey on the phone about seeing my friends young daughters at her funeral, thinking he might have some fatherly advice for me...

He changed the subject. Only to complain about when he met Bob Weir. I don't know if he was maybe trying to relate to me, but I didn't have a negative experience with him. I am still confused what he thinks I did. And why so many people started having a problem with me after that, and that it ended friendships. There are currently no legal reasons why anyone wouldn't be able to speak to me. And I'm going to call several people's bluffs on that. Because I have had people, not anyone directly from the inner circle, but from the outer circle, you know like acquaintances and such; I have had people illegally threatened me. Pro tip, have a lawyer reach out if you want to make an impression. Anything else is intimidation if you're just saying, you want to do it. 

I am very confused why people didn't just leave me alone, if they could not be empathetic and supportive in either of my times of struggle. And I am trying to be very tactful and professional, but I just want to assure you I am lucky to have a lot of support in many different ways; but this was very impactful to be judged and dogpiled on right when I needed compassion and community care. 

And I still don't understand what I am being accused of; or what Jeffrey has said to other people about me. Like I said, I have so much compassion for him, because he related to me. And we have spoken about that. But both times was when he was supposed to be offering space for me. It's unfair to offer that to someone else and then never do it and then like bait and switch them, when they need to release something recently. There are many survivors and neurodivergent people like me within the community, so it is unfair for anyone at all to make up special rules for me, especially when no one's ever tried to discuss boundaries, and I've been trying to ask for my boundaries to be met.

And I asked Jeffrey, do you need any boundaries like I even at prompted him at the end of that conversation, and he said nope you can talk to whoever you need if it helps you find healing. I just wanted one single person to finish that conversation compassionately. I wanted to be heard. I had so much to get off my chest and it was my moment to be heard in every time, he would like flip the conversation back to himself or change it to something else. But he was definitely airing things out. 

Anyway, everyone else has had a chance to take accountability for him and no one really has anyone to say so if that's the end of the discussion, then everyone can leave it alone, and I would actually appreciate it, ifperhaps they could throw me some tickets to the Colorado shows coming up. My friend who also lost our siStar who was a Colorado mama I was hoping to come out around that time so it would be really lovely for us to dance together in honor of her. I had a really positive experience getting to send it last minute on a miracle to Yahn Dawn this year, which my friend had hoped to go to before she passed.

Yeah, and that's the other thing, not only did. He never say condolences for my friend or express understanding towards her family, but he instead disrespected a member of one of the most epic jam bands of all time. So it was like a literal double dead disrespect. Like quite possibly one of the most disrespectful moments of my life. I am cauterizing that wound because I want to dance and make art in honor of my friend, not get stuck in loops of sadness. Self-care is very important, and community care is an aspect of that. I just learned this DBT acronym that explains it:

🩷 ACCEPTS 🩷
-Activities (skills and hobbies)
-Contribute (community care)
-Comparison (relating to others success for motivation)
-Emotions (music, books, shows to evoke feelings)
-Pushing away (pause was right there lol)
-Thoughts (meditation, yoga, dance to redirect mind and body patterns 
-Sensations (wrists under cold water, cold shower, hot bath)

I have had people claim to have any idea of my healing journey or my mental health status, without offering safe space or knowing me at all. Sadly, it's often survivors who do the most healing and should be looked to as leaders on the who discredited and victim blamed the most. I'm going to include some info graphics to hope to reframe perspective for some people. Like I said, I feel pretty confused about a lot of stuff so I might be wrong, wouldn't be the first time. And I'm not saying that I've ever been perfect, but I always try to treat people with compassion. Especially when they are treating me with respect. Respect is something that should be created between two people, not commanded.

Of course, even people who treat us with disrespect, deserve compassion, too, but it changes the ways that we can allow them in our lives. Like I said, I love seeing Jeffrey play percussion, but in the same way that he's been a bit lost consciously to not understand that he literally repeated the cycle of harm instead of actually taking accountability this year. I feel that he is often lost on stage, like lost in space when he plays. This is something I've thought and spoken about to great length, I believe that the way that we expand our consciousness internally, applies to how we can expand it externally.

Meanwhile, Z has been absolutely ripping and bringing the heat on the drums. Just absolutely tearing it up a joy to watch and always engaged. I wish I could include videos from the Colorado shows because everyone sounded amazing. P hit us with those soulful keys, H was going off on guitar, A was bringing the bass, and Z was on fire like I was saying. J did his part, a little lost in space. And no offense, but maybe just a little offense bro: you literally disrespected me and my friend who had just passed; and then change the subject to disrespect one of my favorite musicians! Double dead disrespect! 

So in response to that, I'm going to bring up this fun little idea as a final note just to give us all something to talk about since I'm sure people are going to be like WTF is this even about. (And I'm sorry it's so much information. This is as summarized as I could get it without sounding too vague.) Say that Jeffrey needed to take some time to work on whatever he needs to work on to help him be able to feel comfortable with other people within the community also having stuff they're working on.

Would STS9 be able to function as a four piece band? Would they be able to downsize from two drummers to one like the Grateful Dead did? Let's discuss. I even drew a fun little formation as I envisioned it. ""I remember one of the boys, Bobby maybe?, going on record about how the jams flowed a lot more freely during the no-Mickey years. Something about driving a sports car vs. trying to steer a cruise ship."" says one Reddit user. And my friend says ""Prefer the ""just Billy"" years myself. With a single drummer, keeping improvised flights of fancy rhythmically *tight* becomes much easier. It's like the difference between trying to drive a sports car and an 18-wheeler - tight corners don't usually work too well when improvising with multiple drummers."" 

Like I said, I don't know what they need to do to be able to welcome everyone, but I listened to the podcast that they were on recently and H said the music is for everyone, so are they ready to unblock me on social media and follow me back on IG as it was before? Because I do not feel comfortable covering up for someone else's miscommunication and be treated like I was the one who did an act of violence. Did they block the person who is violent, and the people who have illegally threatened me as well? 

Because it definitely feels like I have had my survivor story rewritten; and I really would appreciate it if they could restore respect to my narrative by affirming that yes I am welcome in this community. Because why would you cut me off from social networking and Literal information about events when you knew I already had tickets yet had people encourage me to go still. Just communicate what the boundary is please, if there needs to be one. 

Especially as there are multiple survivors and neurodivergent people within every circle and community. And if you didn't realize that, maybe you are just not trauma informed enough to have been able to offer the space for them to open up about that. And in a traumatic world, we all are responsible to become trauma informed and gentle parent are in our child and our teenagers into becoming the people that we needed when we were younger. Because no matter how amazing Your family is or what kind of upbringing you have, everyone can use a little support and growth.

So I hope that we all can Tap In, Breathe, Be Nice, Give and Take, and Grow.

I feel a bit sad (and guilty) as I have to turn down another friend's travel invite today. I swear, it's hard to behave when people I know alert for me on travel deals. Lmao. So here I am, browsing through some photos of some of the places I've been to, to cheer me up somehow.

Sharing some of them with you guys. Despite this being a potentially expensive hobby, I always believe that travel is worth every penny. 

Travel allows you to gain experiences that you will not get staying in the four corners of your room. 

Being out there allows you to see what other life possibilities are available. If you are open enough, it will also bring you people that you would have never chance upon if you never set up foot in the very destination where they found you. In fact, I still travelled and remained friends with people I met over a decade ago.

I could go on yap about my many adventures.... For now, enjoy some of the photos I took during my trips.

1ovo97d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ovo97d,Just got my new Bellroy Classic Rolltop (a short review),"
I’ve been searching for a new simple but useful backpack for work lately, and the new Classic Rolltop from Bellroy caught my eye.

I’ve always been intrigued by rolltops, and this one seemed to check some boxes.

Bag Stats:

Size: 26L

Weight: 32oz

Material: Canvas weave, polyester and nylon

Pockets:

1x bottle pocket

1x admin pocket with 3 smaller pockets and a key loop

Main compartment: laptop sleeve, notepad sleeve, 1 large mesh zip pocket, 1 smaller sidewall pocket


My Typical Pack List:

Laptop (Surface)

Notepad

Lunchbox

32oz Hydroflask

16oz travel mug

Couple of pens

Sharpie

Playing cards

Journal

Occasional hoodie or jacket


I’m upgrading from an old Under Armour clamshell backpack that was a company gift about eight years ago. It’s been a solid workhorse but it’s definitely past its prime (also don’t need the old logos to haunt me). I also have an Aer Travelpack Small (28L) that I use primarily for, well, travel. It’s a great bag, but for day-to-day use it feels a little chunky and overbuilt with too many compartments and accessories.

My office needs are pretty simple. I go to work and come home. I wanted something to hold my lunchbox, laptop, water bottle, coffee mug, and a few other small items without feeling bulky.

After packing it out with my daily gear, here are my first impressions:

PROS:

- It’s Bellroy. The build quality is excellent, the design is sleek, and the hardware feels premium. 

- The clasps are metal and the nylon straps feel sturdy and well made.

- It’s comfortable to wear overall. The back padding isn’t perfect, but for commuting and tossing it in the car it’s not a big issue.

- The side zip access to the main compartment is a great feature. I think I’ll appreciate that more over time.

- The mint-colored interior is great. It’s nice to actually see what’s inside instead of digging through a dark void.


CONS:

- WHY DOES EVERYONE ONLY PUT ONE WATER BOTTLE SLEEVE ON THEIR BAGS? Also, can we please get one that fits a 32oz bottle comfortably? My Hydroflask doesn’t fit, which is a little annoying since I usually carry both a water bottle and a travel mug.

- The 26L feels smaller than expected. I knew it would be tighter than my Aer, but I think the rolltop design cuts into the usable space. It’s brand new though, so I’m sure it’ll loosen up with use.

- Back padding could be a little thicker, but it’s not a dealbreaker.

Overall, I like it. 7.8/10 on first impressions. Excited to see how it breaks in and handles a few weeks of daily use.

In the lonely farmhouses on the side of the road 

In Christ's eyes on my rosary 

Pained and peaceful 

In the beauty of that which is dying 

In my memories 

In the lights in the swamp in North Carolina 

Enchanting and haunting 

Piercing through the inky night 

Out of reach, fading into the distance as the car travels on

I left a hospital job after severe burnout and moved back home. I thought I’d take a short break and find something better, but months have passed and I still can’t land another job. Every rejection makes me feel like I’ve ruined my career before it really started.

I’m still a virgin and have never even been on a date. I want to experience sex, love, and connection but at this point, I don’t even know where to start. It feels humiliating to be this old and this inexperienced. The dating apps can't even get a match. Considering going on there and offering money for one coffee date.

I’ve gained a lot of weight over the years and it’s only added to the shame. I’m dieting now, going to the gym, and trying to get my health back, but it’s slow and discouraging. I am 5'6 280lbs and so if I lose weight I will look even uglier with loose skin.

I’m also trying to rebuild: I’m in therapy, I saw a career coach (who honestly wasn’t very encouraging), and I’m doing my best to fix my habits. But I feel paralyzed. Every step forward feels like it’s too late to matter.

I want to move out again, travel, live a real life  but I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve messed up too much to catch up.

My friends joke that in my shoes they would've ended it long ago

I'm turning 22 this week (and starting to see my first gray hair?!). Just came back from a nice trip to California with lots of hikes and other fun activities to remove myself a bit from the rush of every day life. It was a really lovely time. Here is a lovely shot from an afternoon hike above! 

I love to travel, drink too much espresso, play games (Minecraft, Monopoly, or Uno are all great!), and spend time with my doggo. 

I currently live on the east coast of the states, but am moving to Germany next year. So while I'd love to find friends in Germany or neighboring countries to perhaps have some coffee or play games with in the future, I am open to all.

And I don’t even know why it keeps coming up, because the whole situation is just… it’s like when you’re trying to assemble IKEA furniture and the instructions show a guy smiling at a plank of wood and you’re like, “Sir, I am not emotionally prepared for this level of optimism right now,” you know? Like it’s that level of confusion. But anyway, the point that keeps getting mentioned in these conversations, like, over and over, almost as if the universe is hinting at something, or maybe Mercury is in retrograde, or maybe my horoscope was right that one time it said “avoid making statements with certainty,” which honestly feels targeted—but the thing is, people keep saying stuff about my team, specifically in this way that’s kind of… I don’t know, vaguely accusatory? Or maybe not accusatory but like gently poking, the way a cat pokes at a glass on the edge of a counter before committing to chaos.

Where was I going with this?

Right, right—so people keep trying to, like, imply things about my team, and one of the implications, although I’m not sure if it’s an implication or just a misunderstanding or maybe a miscommunication or maybe I hallucinated the entire thing because I did drink that questionable gas-station iced coffee last week, which honestly tasted like the concept of regret—but anyway, there’s this idea floating around that’s, like… well, it’s a thing, and I was going to address it directly, but now that I’m thinking about it, it’s reminding me of that time someone tried to explain cryptocurrency to me at a party and I just slowly backed away into a houseplant.

And now I’m losing the thread again, hold on—

So, my team, right? That group of people. Lovely folks. Friendly. Mostly competent. Gary aside. And I just feel like there’s something I was supposed to clarify about them, but honestly, between everything I’ve said and everything I’ve forgotten to say, I’m starting to think maybe the point has wandered off into the woods to become a folklore creature.

But, um… yeah.

My team are not—well, anyway, it doesn’t matter.

1ovo5qf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ovo5qf,Help with corner of living room,"Good people or Reddit… thanks in advance for helping a girl out. I’ve attached pictures of my living room for the general layout, two pictures of the corner I’m talking about, as well as some AI images (more on that below).

This corner is not living up to its full potential and I am feeling unsure about what to do. Below the blankets are records. I know… great way to store them. And the pillow on the ground next to it is a massage pillow. It just feels like a storage corner at the moment. 

My main idea has been to get some sort of console for my record player + records. Then to get a floating corner shelf and a long pothos to get some plants in the room. Need it up high (cat problems). If I were to go this route I would put record shelves on the walls to display some of my favorite albums. In addition to the pictures of my room I have also attached two images from ChatGPT of this general idea. But if I were to display the records, they would go on the wall opposite the console. 

Is this a good idea? Because it’s the only one I have lol. Very curious to hear about how others would utilize this space. Some additional notes:

- I am hesitant about adding more wood here since I have a wood tv stand and coffee table. If I add more wood I am unsure why shade to go with because I don’t want another dark wood. 

- I feel like I have too many styles I love. I am into mid century, maximalist and dopamine decor, but also love timeless and elegant lol. When I decorate or shop for art for my place, I gravitate towards things that are bright, colorful, funky, funny or interesting to look at… not at things that would necessarily make my room prettier (if this makes sense), but rather more unique.

He is 4 months now and has officially spent a whole month with us (woohoo!) I can’t count the number of times scrolling through this sub has brought me so much hope and comfort so hopefully this too makes it to someone who needs this encouragement as well. 

Context we live in an apartment and I’m currently doing my post grad studies online for a year before I return to work (one of the reasons why we thought it would be opportune to get a puppy now). My husband works a day job and does not have the option to wfh currently.

The first 2 weeks were true torture, I saw someone here describe it as being like a prisoner in their own home and I couldn’t relate more. There were times I broke down because I was so done cleaning up his pee with one hand and holding him in the other while he struggles to lunge at his puddle of pee. I could only shower when my husband came home and I could only pee after tiptoeing to the toilet when puppy fell asleep. 

What worked/didn’t work for us:
1. Playpen restriction 

We did crate training and playpen in the living area, it wouldn’t work and he would go berserk once any of us were out of sight. We then restricted him to just the kitchen cause that was more accessible and was fully puppy proofed. However he was barking/whining a lot once he couldn’t see me and it meant that I had to be within/around the kitchen, which made me feel even more so like a prisoner, now in my kitchen. We tried leaving him alone in the kitchen but he found out how to jail break by running towards the playpen barriers (admittedly they are not the most sturdy, they’re plastic “sheets” clipped together in a line) and throwing his entire body on it. However, we noticed (via the camera) that he was a lot more calm once he was out of the kitchen and was happily free roaming the home (room doors closed) and we thought maybe he just didn’t like being restricted so we attempted to let him just free roam the house. Of course, that meant a lot more accidents and a lot of chasing after him and cleaning up. It also meant that the kitchen restriction came in whenever I couldn’t deal with it anymore haha. This went on until about the third week when we noticed that he has stopped having any accidents! Today, he free roams the house and even when he is playing in the living room, he would run to the kitchen where his pee tray is then return when he’s done whenever he needs. 

2. Crate training 

I know it’s good, but… we kinda gave up on it. He sleeps well around the house throughout the day, he has certain spots where he loves — infront of the fridge, beside our coffee table, and it works! However, we do leave the crate in our bedroom at night with the playpen and he does go in to sleep so I consider that a win.

3. Desensitisation and separation anxiety

We worked really hard on this the first few weeks, and he cried and barked a lot. It gave me so much anxiety just leaving, even more so because we live in an apartment and have 5 other families on the same floor. But we stuck to it and kept going, for just an hour for a meal nearby, groceries, and gradually increased it. The longest we have been gone so far was about 3-4 hours! We gave him a chew with some toys, but he mostly just slept. He still barks once he hears the main door close, but it now lasts maybe 7 minutes at max which is a huge change from him barking for 15 minutes straight from us just being in the study. He still is quite a Velcro dog, and wants to be near us but he has also grown so much where he now can walk away from us in the living room to have a nap in the kitchen! I can now also go to the toilet freely knowing that he will just be waiting outside without barking or crying. He also plays really well on his own! I’ve learnt to give him space to learn to play on his own and it has gotten so much better now. I had the impression that he needed to be entertained every waking moment, but I realised that he actually doesn’t and if I just did my own thing, he will learn that he can just do his own thing too, which he did! 

4. Walks!!!

We had to wait for all his vaccinations to be done, but once we started bringing him on his daily walks, it really helped to get him to rest in the day and eliminate his night witching! Such a game changer for us really because his witching hour was truly horrendous. Think crazy zoomies in the apartment and mad barking and biting. 

We still have bad days, days where he seems to wake up from the wrong side of the crate, where he’s barking for what seems to be no reason at all or nipping at our ankles. He chews on things he shouldn’t be chewing on and the list goes on, but he’s a smart puppy and every time he wakes up from his nap all groggy and is the most cuddliest baby, I am reminded that he has already come so far and has grown so much. This is a 4 month old puppy we are talking about! He hits 5 months in about a week, and maybe we’ll check in again then! 

If you’re in the puppy trenches and you’ve read the entirety of this, trust me when I say that it truly does get better. There is so much information out there on what you should do what you can do what you could try, but remember that every dog is different and do what works for you! I got really stressed thinking this way was THE way and that we should do this or that because everyone does it and it works and it’s good for the dogs! It does get really overwhelming, but do what works for you and if it doesn’t work, try something else! It took us awhile to get to where we are, and I believe you’ll get there too.

At first, everything was great. He was excited, the work was challenging, and he seemed genuinely happy. A few weeks in, he starts mentioning 'Sarah.' It was innocent at first—'Sarah and I totally nailed the presentation today,' or 'Sarah has the most ridiculous coffee mug, you'd love it.' I thought it was sweet that he was making friends.

But lately, it's... different. The mentions are constant, and the way he talks about her has shifted. It’s no longer just about work. It’s 'Sarah and I have this inside joke about...' or 'I was texting Sarah last night and she said the funniest thing.' They have lunch together every day, and a few nights ago, I saw a string of texts from her coming in after 10 PM. It was just memes and casual chatter, but it sent this cold, heavy feeling straight to my gut. It feels less like a coworker and more like an emotional affair.

I finally got the courage to bring it up last night. I tried to be calm and just explain how I was feeling—that the constant communication and the 'work wife' title made me feel insecure and a little bit like I was on the outside of something. He completely shut down. He said I was being jealous and controlling, that Sarah is just a friend, and that he shouldn't have to 'give up his friends' just because I'm insecure. He made me feel like I was crazy for even suggesting it was inappropriate.

Now there's this horrible tension in our apartment. He's being cold and distant, and I'm left feeling completely alone with my feelings. I can't tell if I'm genuinely overreacting or if my gut is screaming at me for a reason. Am I the one in the wrong here?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1ovnsyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1ovnsyy/considering_turning_my_life_upside_down/,considering turning my life upside down,"F, 34 - i‘ve been living in an apartment in the city on my own the past 7 years, i was thriving or so i thought, working from home the past 5 years - was laid off from my secure job AFTER covid and just getting by with unemployment and freelancing paycheck to paycheck. i was content with what i had and felt pretty lucky.

this year though has been a major anxiety rollercoaster, suddenly the projects have stopped falling into my lap and no luck with applications. on one hand i feel confident about my competence but this makes it hard to not internalize and spiral. i‘m also feeling powerless the way fake or overloaded online applications and AI application scanners makes the process feel futile. i‘m feeling so overwhelmed that no anxiety can fuel me to give everything, i just feel paralyzed.

i‘ve had bailiffs aggressively knocking on my door bunch of times which makes me life in constant fear every weekday morning, wondering if any minute i will hear a knock. i‘ve been waking up early lately but i couldn‘t savour it by having a productive morning - the thought of being hounded down just makes me want to disassociate and go back to sleep. the only hours i feel at ease are in the evening-night and weekends.

my apartment has been the thing i‘m most proud of all these years, my sancuary and proof of ‚making it‘ and having my life in order/being an adult. i‘ve been running out of money to pay rent and have not applied for goverment assistance in time, i kept thinking a gig will surely come in any last minute and save me. i now feel dumb af for not applying for gov assistance early in the year, but i guess due to my experience with the unemployment asistance, i just felt too anxious about being dependant and feeling controlled and the humiliation of handing over all my personal paperwork, i thought i would feel less anxious getting by on my own, but i failed.

i‘m considering moving out,put all my furniute in a storage facility, ask for gov assistance and hop around furnished apartments you can book for few weeks or months and alternate with living at my mums back in my hometown and potentially alternate with some travelling. basically become a vagabond while continue trying to find work, both stable/freelance and working on properly building my self-employment business without the anxiety of having to make ends meet. it could also be a way of getting to know more parts of the city and find out where i would want to live next, and maybe the novelty and adventure would get me out of the depressive rut i‘ve been in for the last years.

moving out was always a topic where just the thought of it would give me massive anxiety, since i tied a lot of self-worth and accomplishment to this place and grown so attached. but now that i‘m playing with this idea i‘m feeling kind of excitement. i realize 7 years is a long time and i was younger, this was the first place on my own and i‘ve got to know my needs better. i used to think i might just move to a bigger unit one day, but i think it‘s time for something completely new - the place i‘m in is very modern and a lot of my taste does not match the aesthetic, thinking about designing a new space gets me excited. although getting approved to a new apartment with my debt record would take some time to clear.

i feel sad about leaving the surroundings and the friends i‘ve made - attachment is a bitch. i‘ve been dogsitting my neighbours dog which i would be crushed to give up, but maybe i can still stop by to take it for walks and meet friends i‘ve made.

how insane is this? i don‘t want to live with my mum when approaching 35, so i guess i‘m trying to reframe it. but to be honest i also felt the past years i‘ve only been working to afford staying at home - like literally. travelling seemed too expensive at the thought of having to pay a hotel that costs as much as my rent, and while making ends meet i felt like i might aswell have to stay at home as much as possible to take advantage of it! the thought of not having a home feels kind of freeing in a way, i see myself working in libraries and cafés, not worrying about my apartment sitting empty while i‘m indulging in overpriced coffee instead of drinking my instant coffee at home, cause i could barely afford to stay in it. focussing on my work instead of following my cleaning schedule and worrying about the electric and internet bill. who knows, maybe being out and about unapologetically i could do more networking and meet interesting people.",3,1762996868.0,redscarepod,6,0.72,False

But real talk: do the seals actually hold up after a few months, or am I destined for rubber-ring replacement hell? And what’s your weirdest “I only store THIS in a press-seal” item?

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I have never dated anyone in my life I have in the past and usually talk to women and i have no problem in that. But when it comes to dating it’s been a bit of a hassle.
I’ve been shy and an introvert guy my whole life and I prefer my own company the most I have a bunch of friends we hang out and it’s fun but i struggle when it comes to dating. I see all these couples around campus which makes me want to date people too as to have someone to love and by your side. So i download hinge and matched with this girl in my campus. We talked and it was pretty fun while texting online then we decided to meet for a coffee. The whole day i was so nervous that i didn’t even wanted to go(the same thing happened 6-7 months back too) somehow i managed to make up my mind and go to see how it is. When i was waiting for her i wished she just cancels and i can go back but she came she was nice we talked about random stuff but deep down inside i just wanted to go back to my room i felt like i was uninterested and in an hour or so we parted ways and i went back.

It makes me think that it’s me who just loves the thrill to chase someone and fit in with the society. I dont know exactly what you’re supposed to do when you’re dating it’s not that im not a interesting person but it just feels like idk how to do such things. 

Is it scary for everyone else too? What do you guys do? Maybe these questions are very subjective but idk what to ask or if i just wanted to rant. I dont see the point of dating beyond sex these days honestly i just feel like why bother other people with my problems and they’ll be uninterested either way.",4,1762996765.0,dating_advice,4,0.83,False

Toby said he wants coffee and tea served for the adults instead, and fruit juices to be available for the children. He first said this to me when we had coffee at our favorite place and later suggested it to everyone else. His fiancée agrees. His dad and her parents are quite pleased, noting it would make the wedding cheaper.

His mom disagrees though and said it would be rude to guests. She asked me to convince Toby, saying he might listen to me, but I told her I think it’s up to him and the bride.
