I started following him on Twitter and met him  in person at the coffee on Fridays.  I'm so sad for his family, his wife, his piano playing son, his friends, his colleagues. What a terrible loss. Condolences to all who loved him.

I am not a follower of Islam, but I do come to ask this question in good faith. I was gifted a copy of the Qu’ran by a lovely woman who is a regular customer at my coffee shop, and I gifted her a copy of the Tanakh and Talmud in return. All that to say, I am unsure if I it would be disrespectful to write in/on the physical copy itself? I admit I’m rather uninformed about the guidelines surrounding handling the Qu’ran, so I wanted to double check, to ensure I’m being respectful.

1nnbc91,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1nnbc91/when_making_a_serious_effort_doesnt_change/,When making a serious effort doesn't change anything.,"I have 3 separate Reddit accounts. Thousands of karma. Lots of interaction discussing hobbies, desiring friendship and trying to relate to different communities. I'm a housewife, I'm Black, I'm a gamer, I love fashion, my wife is a professor, I love animals and anime and art and music.. I've made an effort to share who I am and connect with people in so many ways virtually and it doesn't work. 

There's this plague of small talk that can never be purged. Hesitancy to have real conversation - like they'd rather be doing something else than getting to know me. I *get* that if you're in your mid 20s like me you also struggled to learn how to socialize because our adulthood started in the pandemic. We got used to seclusion. Then the world began to further fall apart when the mandate was lifted. Now everyone is wary of each other.. when I just want to sit with coffee or a show amd yap about small fun things. Future plans. A restaurant you want to try. Happiness and politics. Family and life.

Why is it so hard? I'm a nice person.. I dont think I'm such a nuisance or eyesore that I'm unlikable. I try my best to be selfless and not always talk about myself. Or burden others with my baggage. I try so fucking hard to hope that one day I'll meet people who care enough to actually talk to me. I'm 26... I'm terrified of hitting 30 and being just as alone as I am now. It's **not enough that I'm married.** The codependency is overwhelming when your spouse is the only true human interaction you get for months at a time. I'm so tired of trying. Of being ignored.

I'm just so fucking tired.",2,1758509899.0,lonely,0,1.0,False
1nnbc16,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nnbc16/i_25f_feel_stuck_and_confused_by_my_28m/,I [25F] feel stuck and confused by my [28M] boyfriend’s behaviour. Am I overthinking and focusing too much on the negatives or are my feelings valid and I’m being gaslight into thinking it’s okay?,"[tl;dr] - relationship of 2.5 years started going downhill after moving in together 1 year ago. Boyfriend is never around, never does his share for our household and chores, doesn’t ask me about myself or day or week. Always on his phone. I tell him it’s bothering me and I feel alone and want him to participate in this relationship more and he tells me that it’s all because of me and being negative and only focusing on the problems and what he doesn’t do. That he doesn’t want to talk to me because there isn’t anything to talk about. Am I actually overreacting and only focusing on negatives and asking too much of him or am I valid in feeling alone in this relationship? 




I [25F] have been in a relationship with my boyfriend [28M] for 2.5 years. At first it seemed really great and like I found my person. He put effort in and always made me feel heard and seen and loved. 
But since moving in with him 1 year ago, it feels like the relationship has taken a turn for the worse. I’ve been living with one foot in and one foot out for months now unsure about how I’m feeling and if I’m being delusional or too hung up on the negatives or not. Which is why I’m having a hard time deciding if I should keep trying to make it work and solve the issues with him or leave and save myself the trouble. 


I’ll try to make this long list/story somewhat short and to the point. 

Before I moved in I made it very clear that I will not become the housekeeper/maid/cook/personal shopper etc and that if I’m moving in I want it to be a true partnership within the home and relationship. I grew up in a home like that and vowed to never put myself in that position because that’s not what i want for my life or relationship 

It was okay for the first month or so but then it turned into feeling like I’m a)the only person even living here and b)the only person even in the relationship.

I would come home from work and cook dinner and clean up the house a bit. Every-time it would be trash or dishes that he would leave wherever he sat. It started becoming my responsibility to do the general laundry (towels, bedding, blankets etc) because he just wouldn’t do it. Then it turned into me being the only one doing the grocery run and getting the household supplies (toilet paper, paper towel, soap, dishwasher pods) and given yes he pays for half of the bill but will never actually go do it for us himself if I’m busy with work. He won’t clean unless I tell him and even then he’ll only clean his stuff and his area and do a few swipes of the vacuum and that’s his clean. He won’t take the trash out or empty the recycling, he won’t put the laundry in the bin or pull out stuff for dinner even if I ask him to. He won’t cook dinner cause he “doesn’t know what to make or how” even though he was capable of this before I moved in….

So I addressed it with him, I said I felt really alone in the relationship because I work the same amount he was and yet was still the only one keeping up with the household share of duties plus some since he just wouldn’t do it. I also said it sucks when I’m literally at work come home to an empty messy home go to bed alone and do that consistently because he’s always “doing stuff”. 
He told me that he does do it and I’m being dramatic in saying he doesn’t help with anything. He said he cleans and he doesn’t cook because I just do it and doesn’t do the dishes because I just do it and etc etc same response to every task …. Because I just do it and don’t give him enough time to do it. 

At first I was like okay well then I will leave it for you to do…… I’m sure you can guess where this is going. 

I would ask him to unload the dishwasher on his day off when I’m working. But he wouldn’t do it because he forgot or “I was going to do it” even though he had all day to and it’s now 8pm and it’s still not done.

This grew into the reasoning for everything that I just didn’t give him enough time or he forgot or he was going to do it. 

Anytime he had a day off he would wake up leave the house and not come back till 9-10-11pm and the tasks that he said he would do never get done. He goes golfing, he goes skateboarding, he drives around on his e-bike with friends he smokes a bunch of weed and fucks around idek but it always comes first before doing anything for our home. And this is an every night thing. The only time he’s ever actually at home is when none of his friends can hang out with him and he has nothing else to do. But then he still doesn’t do anything for us  or the household. 

I ask him how his day is and what he did, how golf was where he went etc etc I take him coffee to work sometimes when I’m able to as a surprise I make dinner, I plan dates I do a lot. He doesn’t reciprocate and can barely even hold a conversation. All his responses are close ended and one word, he doesn’t return the question of how was your day or how was work. He told me that this isn’t something he feels like he should have to do because we already live together and it doesn’t matter much.  It’s literally like pulling teeth out with pliers trying to get any resemblance of a conversation going with him that’s not about him. He literally does not ask me a single thing about myself. 

So I brought it up again and I got the exact same response. The cycle continued for another month so I brought it up again this addressing that I’m also sick of him only wanting to hang out with me when there is literally no other options for him that day/evening. He also picked up the great habit of coming home in the evening and just going on his phone till he falls asleep. Completely ignorant to me talking to him or sitting next to him he’s that absorbed into his phone. So when I told him all of this He continued saying I’m being dramatic and always focused on the negative and never am positive and uplifting and supporting him. 
He also said that he “likes to be busy” and that if I can’t accept him for that then I should leave. And him going on his phone helps him unwind and that he thinks it’s important to be able to be in each others presence without always having to talk. 

I told him I understand but being busy doesn’t equate to neglecting the relationship, me his partner, and anything to do with the household and chores. 

This continued through this summer and now it’s September and i recently got back into school for my medical program that is an incredibly demanding and busy program. It comes with a lot for studying and being at classes.

Starting off September He went away on a trip with his friends and when he got back he didn’t ask me a single thing about my week didn’t ask me how my first day of classes was or if I’m excited. If I met any new friends, what I did over the week while he was gone literally not a single thing. I literally picked him up from the airport and once I got out the few one word responses to me asking him about his trip it was silent. He couldn’t come up with a single thing to say and then once we got home he just went on his phone and went to bed. 

So I decided to pull back on a lot of what I’ve been doing around the house and decided to wait and see if he would pick up the slack or offer to help or literally anything to show he actually wanted to be a participating partner in our home and relationship. I stopped initiating conversations stopped asking him about his day literally everything to see if he even noticed or cared or decided to start initiating it.

Literally radio silence. The other day he knew I was home all day doing the online classes and that they are from 8am-5 pm and that I don’t have a break between any of them to even make food. He came home after work at 5 picked himself up some supper didn’t text me to see if I wanted anything or if I was hungry or if I’d want to go out for dinner after my classes literally nothing. Came home said hi went on his phone while he ate his dinner he got only for himself then got up went to bed and continued watching his phone. The next night same thing happened only this time he broke a glass and then got mad at me because I stacked the dishes in the drying rack badly and that’s why it broke. Even though it was sat there all day and night with no prior issue. And somehow that was mine to clean up he literally didn’t even bother to try to help pick up all the glass. Just stared at me like a toddler and then went to the bedroom to go on his phone. 

This has been the exact same pattern. I asked him one morning if he could grab me a coffee on his way back from getting an oil change since I was at home studying and he told me “maybe but only if it’s a convenient stop” I said okay but we literally live down the road from 15 coffee shops so like??? And what did he do not get me anything instead came home with his own then grabbed his golf stuff and left again. Texted me after golf asking what I was making for dinner and if I wasn’t making anything to let him know so he could stop for himself. 

Then I accidentally had socks mixed in with his laundry and after he finished doing his laundry instead of setting my stuff on my dresser so I could put it away he just threw it all on the ground on my side of our bed.

And there is so so much more but this will become wayyyy to long if I keep going. The general consensus of it though is although this sounds pretty cut and dry I’m very confused.

He keeps telling me that I’m overreacting and being negative and unhappy and making problems out of no where and always telling him how bad of a job he’s doing and that I’m approaching these things wrong when I have an issue - literally like he wants me to gentle parent him. He says that I’m calling him the worst boyfriend ever etc etc and then he ends up pouting until I apologize for getting upset with him and we return to the same cycle. 

I just feel like I’m in a gas lit room with honestly what I am starting to feel like is a narcissist that refuses to do anything unless it benefits him. The relationship is good enough to him because he’s happy because he has zero responsibilities and does whatever he wants in every second of free time while I am picking up the slack of everything he just will not do. 

So I guess my reason for posting…. Is are all these things truly just negatives and overreactions or are they valid feelings and frustrations that are being blatantly ignored by my partner?

Aria's POV



I stood in front of the chapel.



Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner. My favorite flowers.



The guests were already seated. Soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.



Everything was perfect.



Except I wasn't the bride.



“I really need to see Jace today.”



I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet. Everything I owned in the world.



""No you don’t. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.



I saw disgust in his eyes. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.



But I have my reason to be here.



""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.



Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.



Because today, he was marrying Delilah Hart.



She is the sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.



All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would totally change their lives, including Jace.



So he made the easy call—marrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.



He didn’t want any guests to see me here. Because I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glittering new world.



Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.



“Let me in or I’m starting to yell.” I choked.



The bodyguard frowned. ""Wait here.""



He finally called somebody. A few minutes later, he waved me in.



I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.



Instantly, I felt out of place.



Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more.



And me?



I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.



""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.



No it couldn’t be. I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut.



But poverty had a scent, apparently.



""Mr. Carter is inside."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned, “Make it quick.”



“Thank you.”



The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. White carpet. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment.



And there he was.



The man I used to love.



Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.



Jace was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him.



When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.



""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly.



And immediately, I wanted to punch myself.



Hey, Jace?!



That’s the best I could do?



His face was ice cold.



""You shouldn't come, Aria.” he said with a frown. “Your ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""



Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that’s how it’s done.



""Don’t you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.



He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I’m wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want?""



Wow.



I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard.



I just didn’t realize how deep it ran.



""Maybe chasing Alpha’s sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how shallow and cold you are. You’ll lose it all.""



Anger flared across his face.



""I know how to love someone! I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.” he said freezingly, “Are we done here?""



“No.”



I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.



""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""



Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.



From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor.



Our office romance was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married with Apex CEO’s sister. And I was out of a job thanks to him.



""Right, your job.” The jerk shrugged, “You got your job all thanks to me. Now that I’m not around, maybe they finally saw how incompetent and stupid you are. Problem?""



Was he fucking kidding me?!



""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I snapped.



“Come on, Aria. You really gonna be so naïve?”



He walked closer, smirking.



""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I contacted those customers for you. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""



He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.



""Give me my job back,” I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. “My dad’s debt. My grandma’s medical bills…I need the money. You of all people should know what it’s like to be poor. Don’t. Make. Me. Beg.""



I was throwing my pride at his feet.



But he just laughed.



""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he’d been waiting for this moment.



He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.



""You and I. We never fuck. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I’ll write you very handsome check. How does that sound?""



I widened my eyes in shock.



Then I slapped him. HARD.



“FUCKING HELL…What the hell are you doing?! I’m getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!” He roared covering his swollen face.



""Fuck you, Jace!” I yelled, “You're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey—congrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""



Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.



Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.



God this couldn’t be any worse.



I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life. Because I needed the job and money.



But I still let him get to me.



Now what do I do?



My salary barely covered my rent, my father’s debt and grandma’s bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.



So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I’d rather die than that…



""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.



Too late.



I slammed right into the man in front of me.



He was tall. So tall I felt like I’d just walked into a brick wall.



His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade. When we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.



In one second, the front of my shirt was torn open, exposing my white lace bra.



“Ah!” I gasped and looked up.



This was the most handsome man I’d ever seen. His face was like a statue carved by a master artist. And his expression was so cold and distant.



When he looked down at me, I swear I was about to drown in those stormy gray eyes of his.



Suddenly, I recognized who he was.



This was Alpha of Redstone Pack. CEO of Apex Corporation.



Jace’s brother-in-law.



THE legendary. Grayson Hart.



“Aria Collins?”



His voice was sexy and velvety.



He lowered his head and his eyes dropped to the exposed part of my bra. Maybe it was just my imagination, but the color of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared.



Wherever his gaze landed, my skin started burning up.



But wait.



How did he know my name?



Chapter 2 With Ex's Brother-in-law

Aria’s POV



Of course I recognized him. God, who didn’t?



I’d met him at the Apex gala. His face was on every finance magazine cover, and any time you turned on a TV, there he was—linked to the latest scandal with some actress or model.



But there was no way he’d know who I was.



“I-I…Hello, Alpha Grayson,” I stammered.



He turned his eyes away and said to a nearby guard, “Escort Ms. Collins out.”



“Yes, Alpha.”



The guards stepped in immediately, stretching out their arms like I was some kind of contaminant that might taint Grayson’s perfectly tailored suit.



“Wait a minute. You’re not going to say something about my shirt?” It’s torn beyond repair and was showing my breasts.



He paused. Just for a brief second. Then flicked something down at my feet.



I looked down. A blank check.



“I need a shirt that can cover my front. Not your hush money.” I gritted with humiliation.



But he didn’t even glance back and just walked away.



“God,” I muttered under my breath.



Can you believe these rich bastards?



They think they can buy everything with money.



People nearby were all staring, snickering under their breath. I tried to cover my chest and grab my things to escape, but it was hard to do all that with just two hands.



“Oh my god…Aria Collins?”



Three girls emerged from the whispering crowd. I took one look at them and sighed internally.



Great. Just when I thought today couldn’t get any worse.



“Hello. Layla. Sabrina. Brielle.” I said dryly.



I used to work in the same team with these girls back at Apex. We were all under Jace.



These girls adored Jace. They spent more time flirting with him by the coffee machine than actually working. Which left me doing most of their work.



After I got fired, and when news of my secret relationship with Jace got out, they decided I was public enemy number one.



“What are you even doing here, Aria? Trying to win back your ex at his wedding? That’s a new low even for you,” Layla snickered.



“I’m not here to win anyone back.” I tried to push past them.



But they blocked me.



“What happened to your shirt?” Brielle snickered. “Did you seriously walk in here with your bra out? Is this like some low-budget fashion statement?”



They burst into laughter together.



“You could be completely naked and Jace still wouldn’t give a damn,” Sabrina squeaked. “Because he’s marrying Lady Delilah. THE Delilah Hart! Redstone Pack’s sweetheart. And you…well you’re just a poor-ass small-town girl.”



I stopped in my track and gave them a cold glare, “Oh yeah? Well at least this smalltown girl actually dated Jace. And you all got nothing. Do you know how many times I had to listen to him complained about your screechy voices and cheesy perfume after we got home? Apparently he rather be with me than any of you.”



Their jaws dropped.



“Jace would never say that!” Brielle cried.



“And my perfume isn’t cheesy!” Sabrina screamed.



“Word for word,” I rolled my eyes. “Now move. Or I’m rolling this suitcase over your pretty little skirts.”



They looked like ruffled chickens, but they parted. I quickly shoved my dingy luggage ahead like a weapon and stormed out of the church.



Rich people were assholes.



Grayson, Jace, and their whole damn minions.



I struggled to get my suitcase down the steps, and once I hit the street, cold wind slapped me in the face.



It’s almost night. But I had no idea where to go.



I could crash in the hospital with my grandma, but she’d ask too many questions. Like why I hadn’t brought Jace around recently, or why I wasn’t staying at my apartment. I didn’t want her to know how bad things had gotten.



I thought about the park. Sleeping on a bench. But in a ripped T-shirt that exposed my whole front? Horrible idea.



So I texted my best friend, May, asking to stay at her place for a few days. She was my rock. If the whole world turned against me, at least I still had her.



She texted back right away inviting me to come over.



Dragging my suitcase across the street toward the bus stop, I told myself it was going to be okay. This horrible day was going to end.



Then I heard them.



“Hey, nice shirt!”



A group of street wolves were loitering near the stop.



I hugged myself tighter and curled into the bench, hoping they’d get bored and leave.



“C’mon baby, drop your hands. Let us see what you’re working with.”



Go away. Go away. Go away.



“You rip that shirt yourself? Damn that’s wild. I like that in a girl.” One of them moved closer, reaching for my shoulder.



“Fuck off!” I snapped, my voice shaking.



But it only fired them up.



“Oh, feisty. Shake those tits for me!”

Dylan didn’t put the suit on until Sunday. Well, that’s a bit of a lie I guess—he put it on as soon as we got home with it Thursday, but only to see how it fit and how it looked, and took it right back off again.

He said it really was pretty clean and well-kept, and it just smelled like leather on the inside, and a little musty. Like an old cowboy hat. He said it fit like a glove. I have to say he looked pretty damn cool in it. The mouth is sewn shut so his voice is kinda muffled, but other than that it’s badass. That Eric guy’s family really did take good care of it. 

Saturday we went to OxFurred. Dylan left the bear suit at home that day because he said he wanted to do Saturday in his street clothes and Sunday in the suit.

The con was fun. I had a good time. I commissioned a piece of artwork of my fursona Codex. I mean, it’s not like the big deals—AnthroCon, Furry Weekend Atlanta, that kind of stuff—but the conference rooms at the Oxford Marriott are plenty big enough for our little event.

When I was a kid I used to go to local gun shows with my dad, and it was a lot like that, just tables and tables of merch and people walking around in costumes. Like DragonCon or ComicCon, I guess, just on a smaller scale, and it’s mostly furry stuff. I’ve never been to those other cons, but that’s what I figure they’re like from the pictures I’ve seen of them.

Both me and Dylan had to work Sunday morning but we got off early so we could go to the con. He went straight home and put on the fursuit, and we picked him up in Jacob’s 4-Runner.

He was quiet the whole way there. Dylan’s kinda shy, so I think he was embarrassed about wearing it, but he shouldn’t have been—he looked fucking badass, and it turned out to be a hit at the con. Everybody wanted to pet him and he won second place in the costume contest. The longer he walked around in the costume, the more relaxed he got, until he was dancing and joking around like everybody else.

I think part of that was because he could hide behind the mask and be someone—*something* else. Myself, that’s why I love situations where I can wear a mask, especially Halloween. I like stepping out of my own skin for a little while.

Around suppertime, I asked him if I could wear it. He said no, but he seemed unsure. We were in the Marriott parking lot then, me, Dylan, and Steven, walking to the Mellow Mushroom across the street. Dylan looked goofy walking out in the open air with his big bear feet flopping like clown shoes every time he took a step. 

“Hey, Yogi, do you mind I try the suit on for a little while?” I asked him. “After we eat?”

“I don’t know, Boo-Boo.”

“Why not?”

“It’s kinda sweaty in here. Probably stinks.”

“Maybe just the head, then. You have to take it off to eat anyway, right?”

He nodded, which looked hilarious. “Okay.”

It’s finally cold here, so we ate inside. It was quiet and there were only two other tables with customers because most everybody else was still at the con and it was probably kind of late for supper. The waitress gave Dylan a crazy look when she came to our table to take our drink orders, then cracked up. “What are you doing later?” she asked him. “I’ve never been with a bear before!”

“Once you’ve gone grizzly,” he said, muffled inside the bear head, “you never…go…shizzly?”

After the waitress left, Dylan planted his thumbs under the bear’s jaw. His posture made him look like his brain was about to explode. “All right, I think it’s time to come out of this thing.”

“Get out of my head, Charles!” I joked.

“It’s not funny, man.” Dylan strained, pushing at the bear’s jaw. “I think my head’s stuck. Like, my ears are hung. It’s catching under my ears.”

“At least *something* about you is hung,” said Steven.

The bear turned and deadpanned at him. Dylan got up out of the booth and continued pushing at the bear-head. “Here,” said Steven. He hooked his fingers under the bear’s jaw and hauled backwards on it several times.

“That hurts! Feels like it’s ripping my fuckin ears off!”

I grinned. “It’s just a little smaller than you thought.”

“That’s what she said.” Dylan braced himself against the table and the back of the booth. “Okay, let’s try again.”

Steven clutched the head and pulled. This time it came off with a rough slurp of leather.

“Ah! God *damn!”* Dylan came out wincing, holding his earlobes. His face was red and his eyes were glassy like he was trying not to cry. “Felt like you almost tore my ears off.”

The bear-suit was one whole piece like a bear-skin rug, so the head lay on his back like a jacket hood. He rubbed the top of his skull. His blonde hair was plastered to his forehead with sweat.

When we got done eating, we headed back to the con. It was getting late, so a lot of the people had thinned out and some of the tables were bare. Probably headed upstairs to sleep. Jacob and Ashleigh were sitting on the stage in a drum circle with three other people, playing a card game.

“You about ready to head home?” Steven asked Jacob.

“Yeah, just lemme finish this hand and we can go.”

Dylan had put the costume’s head back on, and he climbed up onto the stage (more of a platform, really, made out of nine interlocking pieces with a ramp on one side) where he lay on his back staring up at the ceiling and looking really introspective for a bear.

I sat next to him. “You okay?”

“Yeah. I guess. I just don’t feel good.”

“Maybe you should take the fursuit off. Are you getting too hot?”

“No,” he said, the bear’s head shaking back and forth. “It feels pretty good in here now that it’s dark and getting cold outside. Besides, I don’t have a shirt on. Just a pair of jogging pants, socks, and my underwear.”

About a half hour later, their game ended and we headed home. We all lived a town over to the north, in a neighborhood called Lenlock, except for Dylan and Steven. Dylan lived in an apartment complex a few minutes farther out, across from the gate to Fort McClellan, and Steven lived in Jacksonville, which was another ten minutes. We were just getting to the far side of Oxford when Dylan let out a massive fart in the front passenger seat.

“Jesus Christ!” said Jacob, turning down the radio. He was listening to The Weeknd at top volume. “That sounded like somebody jammed a leaf blower into a roast turkey’s ass. I heard it over the music.”

“I am *so* sorry.” Dylan sounded legitimately embarrassed.

Ashleigh leaned forward, talking over Jacob’s shoulder. “You should be! Did you shit yourself?”

“No. But I don’t feel good.”

“You all right?” asked Jacob. “I can pull over if you want.”

By this time we were on the main road, Quintard Avenue, a busy four-lane highway through the middle of Anniston, the town between Oxford and Lenlock. “No, it’s okay.”

“You sure?”

Dylan paused, the bear’s big mitts on the console and doorhandle. “Actually, yeah. I think I might…yeah, you wouldn’t mind pulling over, would you? I think I might puke.” The 4-Runner eased off the highway into a strip mall parking lot and Dylan got out. He stood next to the car with his paws on his shaggy brown knees, staring at the pavement as cars breezed past. I opened the door and got out.

“You probably want to take that head off,” I said, putting my hand on his back. “You don’t want to puke in it.”

“Okay.”

I grabbed the sides of the bear’s head and pulled.

Dylan’s whole body rocked forward. “Ow.” He braced himself against the inside of the 4-Runner’s open doorframe. I put my foot on the running board and pulled the costume’s head again. *“OWW! Quit pulling so fucking hard! My ears!”*

“Well, you gotta take it off,” said Steven.

“I guess.” Dylan sounded exasperated.

“What do you mean, you guess?” I asked, my palms still on the bear’s cheeks. “You got to get this off before you puke in it.”

“It’s warm in here. The suede is nice.”

I pulled again. This time he straight-up shouted, and then he let out another blatty tuba fart. He pushed my hands away and stood up, then paced back and forth next to the car. Must have been psyching himself up or something, because he went back to the 4-Runner, braced himself, and said, “Okay, try it again. The chest on this thing is getting tight. It feels like a girdle or something.”

As I grabbed the head, Dylan murmured, “Don’t worry about my ears. Just get this thing off of me, please.”

“All right,” I said, and pulled as hard as I could.

Dylan screamed like he’d been Tasered and came up out of the 4-Runner. He pushed my hands away again and pried at the bear’s jaw with the heels of his hands, hollering out loud. ”Fuck! It won’t come off!”

“Is it tied down or something?” I asked, and combed the fur around his neck with my fingers, looking for leather lacing.

“No, it just slips on and off! Or at least, it did.”

“Did your head swell?” asked Ashleigh, visibly trying not to laugh.

The bear looked back at her and started breathing really fast. I think he might have been having a panic attack or something.

“Are you claustrophobic?” I asked.

“No?”

“Let’s take Ashleigh home,” said Jacob. “Her mom’s been calling. After that we’ll take you to your house and we’ll figure out how to get you out of that suit, even if we have to cut the laces.”

Dylan got back in the 4-Runner and we took Ashleigh home. When we got to his house on the other side of Lenlock, he unlocked the front door and went straight to his cramped little apartment kitchen, where he opened a drawer and rifled through a bunch of junk. His claws clattered uselessly across things like marbles, a light switch plate, a ruler, an empty Glade plug-in.

“Damn, I can’t see,” he said, bending over, almost with his snout buried in the junk drawer. He stepped back. “Get me the scissors out of there.”

Steven got them out and spread the fur on Dylan’s chest with his fingers, looking for the laces. “There we are.” He slipped one of the scissor blades through the leather cord and cut it free, then the one under that. There were four knots in all, from the base of his neck down to just under his navel. He pulled the leather cords out as he went, leaving the little squiggles on the kitchen counter.

“Didn’t loosen it up any,” said Dylan.

The bear’s claws fumbled around on his chest as if he were searching his shirt pockets. I stepped in and pulled the fur on Dylan’s chest, hair tangled in both fists. Dylan himself lurched forward. I picked through the hair, trying to find the gap in the middle where I thought the opening should be, but there was just a tight seam like the stitch running down the side of a shirt.

“Is there a zipper?” I asked, running my fingers up and down the seam. “I don’t remember seeing—”

“No,” said Dylan. “No zipper. Just the ties.”

I pulled the bear’s chest hair again.

“Ow,” he complained.

“It feels like it’s either really tight, or like it’s glued to your skin.”

“What?” He massaged his chest again, and I realized he was trying to get his fingers into the gap in the middle of his chest. “Damn, I can’t grab anything with these claws.”

Steven pressed the tip of the scissors against the seam running up Dylan’s chest and tried to wiggle it through the gap and under the fabric so he could cut it. That didn’t work, so he pinched off a handful of the suit and closed the scissor-blades on it, trying to cut into it.

The bear-skin just slipped bluntly between them, turning the scissors sideways and almost breaking them apart.

“I don’t understand what the fuck is going on,” he said, annoyed.

Jacob came in as Steven started rifling through the other drawers in Dylan’s tiny, messy kitchen. “What are you guys doing in here?”

“The suit won’t open,” I told him. “We cut off the ties and it’s still, like, sealed or something.”

Steven found the silverware drawer, crashed around in it, opened another drawer.

Dylan’s claws clattered against the sink as he leaned on it. “You don’t think that Eric guy put some kind of glue on the inside of this thing, do you? Maybe it was some kind of prank. Man, I don’t have insurance. I can’t afford to go to the hospital.”

“We won’t need to go to the hospital,” said Steven. He had a kitchen knife in his hand. “We’re going to get this thing off you right now.”

“No,” Dylan said gravely. “You’re going to stab me. On accident.”

“He’s not going to stab you,” said Jacob, following us out of the kitchen.

Dylan sat on his couch, a shitty thrift store thing that looked (and smelled) like it was put together out of a dozen professors’ tweed jackets. “What about the glue, though?”

“We’ll find something that can dissolve it.”

His laptop was on the coffee table. I turned it around and brought it out of sleep mode as Steven and Jacob sat down on either side of Dylan. The living room was dark, but the kitchen knife reflected a flash of light from the kitchen. Jacob turned on the lamp sitting on the end table so they could see.

I opened a browser and hesitated. “I don’t know what kind of glue it was.”

“I never smelled nothing,” said Dylan.

“No chemicals, nothing?”

“Nothing but leather and dust. Just smelled old, I dunno. The inside of the fursuit was dry when I put it on, too.” He sat back and sighed. “Is there a glue that activates when it gets wet? Like, with sweat?”

“I wouldn’t know.” I didn’t, but I Googled it. “There’s something called Wet-n-Stick water-activated adhesive tape.”

Jacob shook his head. “I don’t think it was tape.”

“Water vapor activates Krazy Glue. Maybe he coated the inside of the suit with it, let it dry, and maybe his sweat re-activated it.”

Steven grabbed a handful of the bear’s chest hair. “Whatever it is,” he said, placing the knife against Dylan’s chest as if he were about to scalp his right pectoral, “I’m sure acetone will break it down. Acetone breaks down all kinds of glue…Krazy Glue, anyway.” He looked up. “My uncle owned a shoe shop when I was a kid.”

Dylan pushed the knife away. “Not there, not near my neck. Or my chest. I don’t want you slippin and stabbin me in the jugular.” He offered his arm, palm down. “If you can get through that, you can cut up toward my shoulder. Saw through the fabric.”

“What’s acetone?” asked Jacob.

“Nail polish remover.”

Dylan shook his head. “Yeah, I don’t have any of that here.”

Pinching off a bit of the suit again, Steven gingerly ran the knife back and forth across the top of Dylan’s forearm.

All he got was a handful of shaved hair.

“Keep trying.”

Steven cut a little harder. Cut some more hair off. By now the bald spot was about the size of a playing card, and the edge of the knife was scuffing back and forth across the surface of the leathery bear skin. He wasn’t even holding the skin with his other hand anymore, he was just sawing at his friend’s arm like he was cutting into a tree. “Man, this stuff is tough.”

“That’s enough,” said Dylan. “I’m afraid you’re going to cut through it and cut me.”

“I’m not going to cut you.”

“But what if you do? I don’t have a first aid kit here.”

“I won’t.” Steven took his wrist and started sawing at it like he was playing a violin, the blade making a *shicka shicka shicka* sound.

“I said no!” Dylan slapped at his chest.

Two of the talons on the bear suit caught in Steven’s shirt and ripped a hole in it. He leaned back and shot up off the couch, inspecting his chest. “Woah, okay, I’ll stop. Jesus.”

“Sorry.” Dylan put his big mitts in his lap.

After a minute, he got up off the couch. “It’s getting late and I’m sleepy as fuck. I’m about to pass out. We’ll keep trying to cut this thing off in the morning but right now I just don’t feel like dealing with it. If we can’t do anything with it then, I guess we’ll go to the hospital.”

“I’ll go somewhere as soon as the stores open and get some nail polish,” said Steven. “This is pretty much my fault…I’m the one that bought the fursuit.”

==============

#4

Dylan woke up really early Monday morning because he pissed on himself—no flyhole—and he had like, a panic attack.

He was pacing around the house talking to himself and trying to get out of the fursuit. I could hear him crying inside the bear-head, and for some reason he was holding the remote control to the TV. He was twisting it as he walked, the plastic creaking inside his thick paws.

“We’ll get you out of there,” I tried to tell him.

Steven was already up, putting towels down on Dylan’s mattress to try to soak up some of the piss. He had already stripped the bed and put the sheets in the hamper; I got them and put them in the washer. A shirt and a pair of blue jeans were hanging from a clothesline strung across the inside of the utility closet, because there was no dryer.

When I came back, Steven was rummaging around in Dylan’s kitchen. I asked him what he was doing and he said he was looking for something better to cut the bear skin. I sat back down in the living room and finally talked Dylan into sitting down too. I almost wish I hadn’t, because he smelled like popcorn butter.

A few minutes later, Steven came into the living room carrying something that looked like a Geiger counter.

“No,” said Dylan.

I was still rubbing sleep goop out of my eyes. “What is that?”

Steven held up a six-inch serrated blade and pushed it into the end of the Geiger counter until it clicked. “It’s an electric turkey carver.”

Dylan got up and left. “No.” He went into the bathroom.

“It’s got to work,” said Steven, following him. I went too. Dylan tried to shut the door in our faces, but Steven stuck his foot in the way. “We’ve got to get you out of that suit. I can hear your stomach growling.”

There was a brief pause as Dylan considered it, and in that space I did indeed hear it rumble.

“…Okay.”

Dylan let go of the door and put the toilet seat down with a clatter, then the disheveled-looking bear sat on the edge of the bathtub.

“While I do this,” Steven said, sitting on the toilet, “I want you to call that asshole Eric and ask him what the fuck is going on with this costume.” He handed me his cellphone and unlocked the thumbprint lock. “It’s the last number I called.”

“You don’t need the power cord,” said Dylan, one handful of claws pointing at the cord in Steven’s other hand. “It’s battery-operated.”

Steven put the bundled-up cord on the sink and started the turkey carver. It was an antique-looking Ostermeier or Osterman, something like that, I think his mom probably gave it to him. As soon as it kicked on, the bathroom reverberated with a raspy roar that sounded like firefighters were cutting someone out of a car with a reciprocating saw.

“Oh, fuck me,” said Dylan. He held out his arm. “Come at it at an angle so you don’t saw straight down into my arm if you get through—”

*“When* I get through.”

“—When you get through the suit.”

Steven took hold of the bear’s wrist and eased the blade down onto the back of Dylan’s forearm. I didn’t say anything about how the tilted angle made it look like Steven was cutting off a slice of Thanksgiving turkey.

Grateful for the excuse to leave, I went into the living room and called Eric.

The phone rang seven times before he picked it up. When he answered, he sounded pissed, like I’d interrupted something. “Yeah? What do you want? You want your money back?”

“I just want to know what’s up with this fucking suit. It won’t come off.”

“What?”

“It won’t come off. Did you put something on the inside of the suit? It’s like it’s glued to his skin. We can’t get it off of him and scissors won’t go through it.”

“Bear skin’s tough.”

“I get that. Listen, did you say it was some kind of Creek shaman costume or something?” I could still hear the turkey carver humming in the other room, and every time Steven bore down on it the noise would deepen and chug like a lawn mower hitting wet grass.

“Coosa. And shaman ain’t a word. Well, it is, but it ain’t a Indian word. It’s a racist word, is what it is—”

“I don’t care. I just want to know more about the medicine man part. Does that have something to do with why it won’t come off? The head won’t even pull off. We got it to come off once yesterday, but it took forever, and then for some reason he put the fucking thing back on and now it’s really stuck.”

“Kid,” Eric seemed to relax. I could hear him moving around, like he was walking somewhere, and he inhaled sharply, as if he was taking a drag off a cigarette. Then his voice became a little clearer, and he spoke a little slower. “That whole thing about the Coosa medicine man? That was bullshit. I just made all that up to get y’all interested in it. It’s really just something my daddy made back in…oh-three, I reckon. He used to make taxidermy stuff, oh he makes all kinds of snakeskin belts and boots.”

“What? You lied?”

“Yeah. It ain’t no Indian costume, it’s just some crap my daddy made. He died last year and I been keepin his shit around the house ever since…but here lately I just really needed the money and I thought—well, I figured I needed the money more’n I did the suit.”

“Why the lie? We were already interested. You were only asking forty bucks for it.”

“I had it up on the innernet for like six weeks, y’all kids are the first ones to actually show up to come look at it. I figured it would sweeten the pot if I told you it was an antique Cherokee medicine man suit.”

“I thought you said it was Coosa.”

“Yeah, Coosa,” said Eric, taking another hit off of what I imagine was a joint.

“You can’t even get your own lie straight.”

“I ain’t no damn book-writer.” His voice sounded strained, as if he were holding in the toke, and then he let it out with a luxuriant sigh. “Listen, boy, if you’re callin to ask about gettin your money back, I can’t do nothin for you. I ain’t got it no more.”

“That’s not why I called. I don’t care about the money. I just want to know how to get the suit off and why it got stuck in the first place.”

“I don’t know nothin about that.”

The turkey carver groaned in the bathroom. I could smell the raunchy chemical stink of burning hair. “Are you sure?” I asked Eric, heading back down the little hallway. “Because I think you’re full of shit.”

Dial tone. He’d hung up on me.

“You son of a bitch,” I said into the deaf iPhone as I stepped into the bathroom. The air was smoky and the room stank like a combination of a barbershop fire and a wet dog. Jacob was up. I guess the noise from the turkey carver had woke him up.

“How is—” he started to ask me, but as soon as I walked in the turkey carver broke through the bear-skin and cut into Dylan’s arm with a horrible bogged-down *ZZZZHANK!* noise.

The blade stopped vibrating. Inside the carver, the motor just hummed like a live wire. Blood sprayed once up the wall and Steven pitched the turkey carver into the sink. He jumped up off the toilet and stood there, speechless, his hands shaking. He’d managed to cut through the suit fabric, all right—and straight down into the top of Dylan’s forearm. The only reason the carver had stopped was because the blade had hit bone.

Through the narrow gap in the fur, I could see the dark red pulp of bisected muscle, like the inside of a pomegranate, shot through with what looked like thin scrambled eggs, yellow and curdy.

Blood pattered on the white tile floor in big rainy watercolor drops. Dylan banshee-howled. “JESUS FUCKING CHRIST I SAID YOU WERE GONNA CUT ME YOU ASSHOLE!”

All three of us stood there in shock, watching him bleed on the floor.

“DO SOMETHING!” shrieked Dylan from inside the bear-head.

I put down the phone and snatched up the carver’s charging cord, winding it around Dylan’s arm just above the elbow. Then I scanned the bathroom for a stick, which turned out to be the toilet plunger. I unscrewed the stick out of it, then slid it through the charging cord and twisted it like a crank until it was as tight as I could get it, creating a tourniquet.

Steven was still standing there in the bathroom doorway, his eyes unfocused, his hands clenched into half-open fists at his sides. “911.” He seemed to snap out of a trance and he picked up the phone.

“We don’t have time for that—”

Dylan was bleeding all over me and the floor. “And I don’t have money for an ambulance,” said his muffled voice from inside the bear-head.

“—So come on,” I said, turning Steven around and pushing him into the hallway with Jacob, “we’ll drive him there.”

* * *

We went straight to the emergency room and admitted Dylan. The nurse that took him and the receptionist at the front desk told us we couldn’t go into the back because we’d just be in the way, but about a half hour after we set up camp in the waiting room, a cop showed up and started asking us screwed-up questions about whether Dylan had tried to commit suicide and why he was wearing the bear suit.

I tried to tell him that he wasn’t trying to commit suicide and that he was stuck in the suit, but he didn’t seem to believe either one of those factoids. Then he told us we weren’t allowed to see him or take him home until somebody could determine that he wasn’t going to be a danger to himself or anybody else.

We kept talking at the cop until I think we convinced him that it wasn’t suicide—but then he got it into his head that Dylan was on some kind of drugs. Once he got that in his head, he started paying real close attention to us, and he even shined his flashlight in our eyes to look at our pupils.

God I hate cops.

After he decided we weren’t on PCP and took a hike, I borrowed Steven’s phone to type my previous post; I had a lot of downtime sitting in the hospital waiting area.

Steven went to see if the nurses had changed their minds about letting us see him, but Dylan was gone. Apparently he’d gotten up in the middle of the night and went to get something out of the vending machine by the elevators, but he never came back.

I still don’t know how Dylan got out of the hospital without us or the cop seeing him, though at that point I don’t know if the cop was still here. He said he went up to keep an eye on him, but I think he was just faking us out so he could leave.

That was Monday night. I worked Tuesday and went to bed as soon as I got home.

About 2 in the morning I woke up because someone was unlocking the front door of my apartment. I sat up and listened and wished I’d had the forethought to keep a ball bat by the bed. I used to, but that was when I was living over closer to Oxford, in the “bad part of town.”

You’d be surprised with it being Alabama: prostitutes, drug-dealing, Bloods, dudes shooting squirrels out of trees for food.

Guess I’ve been out here long enough to kick the ball bat habit. “Who is that?” I asked my dark apartment.

A drawer opened in my kitchen. Somebody was rummaging through my silverware. Rattle, clash, bang, the drawer slammed shut. Another one opened. More rattling, more crashing.

“Dylan?” I asked.

I picked up the lamp on my nightstand and got ready to throw it.

Whoever it was came up the hallway, and the shadow coming off the streetlight in the living room window was huge.

My heart was already pounding but when that damn bear suit came lurching through the bedroom door, there was a sharp pain like a needle deep in my left armpit. Dylan’s silhouette stood in the door, holding a kitchen knife. Apparently the nurses had been able to remove the bear-paw on the side we’d—Steven, I mean—had cut him on, and that was the hand he was holding the knife with.

Shit you not, he looked six inches taller. The tips of the bear’s ears were brushing the top of the door.

He was just standing there with the knife.

“What are you doing?” I asked him. My voice cracked on the *doing.* “Why did you leave the hospital?”

He came toward the bed.

I threw the lamp at him, but it hit the end of the power cord and dropped on the floor with a *thud.* Dylan stepped on it and stood over my bed with the knife.

That theater-popcorn smell of piss rolled over me in a wave. I was already scrambling off the other side and into the crack between the window and the bed. “What are you doing?” I said, my hands planted on my duvet like a bulldog.

Dylan raised the knife to his face and started brushing the bear’s teeth with it, making a plinky sound like when you rake your fingernails up and down a hair comb.

“I’m so thirsty, Cody,” croaked Dylan, and I realized he was cutting the stitches hemming the bear’s mouth shut. “And hungry.”

I took him into the living room and finished cutting the stitches out of his—I mean, *the bear’s* mouth. Swear on my mother’s grave, he must have gained thirty pounds since Monday night.

Was he always this big? Sitting on my futon, he looked like a giant. I felt like a little boy sitting in front of an adult. Did he play football in high school? I couldn’t remember.

As I worked, my eye traveled down to his bare arm. The hospital had stitched up the gash from the turkey carver. Betadine highlighted the skin around it in orange. His hand was covered in ugly road rashes like someone had been at it with a belt sander.

“Thank you for taking me to the hospital.” Dylan’s breath was labored, like he had pneumonia or something. “I told that asshole Steven he was gonna cut me.”

“Why did you leave?” I pulled the loose stitches out of the bear’s mouth after I cut them. The jaw didn’t swing freely, but I could pry it open with my hands, the yellow teeth long enough to jut up between my fingers. Packed into the bear’s mouth was what looked like a handful of dried moss.

“I was thirsty and I couldn’t get anything out of the vending machine.”

I dug the moss out with my finger and left it on my coffee table, where it looked like a clump of marijuana. “How did you get into my apartment?” I asked, as I took the knife back into the kitchen.

“You showed me your magnetic key-hide. Under the bottom step of the stairs going up to the apartments over yours.”

Instead of putting it back where he got it, I put the knife in the crock pot my ex-girlfriend and me got for our one-year anniversary. It was still in the box; I hadn’t used it since she left, but it would make a good hiding spot in case Dylan decided he wanted to rifle through my kitchen again. The rest of my knives went into the crock pot too: six butter knives, two steak knives, a rusty carving knife I accidentally left outside for a week last summer, and a paring knife.

For good measure I put all the forks in there too. I put the lid on the crock pot, closed up the box, and shoved it into the back of the cabinet. Maybe the pizza cutter wouldn’t be too dangerous, but the cheese grater went into the freezer.

Back in the living room, I pried the bear’s mouth open again. There was no bear-tongue, just a dry funnel of leather rimmed in teeth, but the back of its throat was walled off by what felt like a piece of cardboard or heavy paper.

Exploring it with my fingers, I found a hole in the corner behind the molar teeth where we’d stuck the straw to feed him Ensure. I hooked my finger in it and ripped the cardboard out, going back twice to get it all.

Dylan gasped, and hot breath washed over my fingers as I cleaned out the scraps of cardboard. Deep in the pit of the bear’s throat, I could see his mouth working. “Fresh air!”

I sat back to give him some space. “Now what am I going to feed you?”

“I don’t know,” Dylan’s voice said from the back of the bear’s throat. “I don’t give a shit. I don’t care. Something. Anything.”

A bunch of leftovers in the fridge, but not really anything I could push down the bear’s throat without making a mess—spaghetti, China Buffet, a jar of relish. Finally, I settled on a steak. I would have to cook it, but I could cut it up and flick it down his throat without too much of a mess.

“A steak?” he asked.

“Yeah. It won’t take too long. Just bear with me.”

“Jesus fucking Christ.” It sounded like he was about to burst into tears. “Are you messing with me?”

I caught my accidental pun and winced.

“Could you turn on the TV for me before you go?”

“Yeah.” I touched his hand with the remote control and he took it, started awkwardly flipping through channels with the bear-claws. I took out my Foreman and started the steak.

When I came back he was watching some late-night show. I debated putting steak sauce on the steak, but decided I didn’t want to get A-1 all over the inside of the bear’s head and just cut it up dry. He didn’t say anything as I worked, scraping and clinking, and didn’t say anything as I finished and sat on the table so I could see his face.

“You ready?” I asked him.

He was still silent, but he was breathing. His chest was rising and falling. I guess he fell asleep waiting on me. “I’m gonna feed you, buddy. I got steak here.” I forked a piece of meat and presented it in front of the bear’s eyes. God he was so fat. I feel bad about saying it now, but really I don’t remember him being that fat. Or broad-shouldered. “You awake?” I put down the fork and poked him in the ribs.

Deep inside the bear’s mouth, Dylan muttered something.

“What?” I put down the plate and leaned closer. He repeated himself. It sounded like *oh, sweejuh.* Maybe *oh sweet Jesus.* “What are you t—”

The bear’s jaws lunged at me. Hot breath hit my face.

As soon as his nose touched my forehead I recoiled, falling backwards off the coffee table, and scrambled up onto my knees. Somehow I still had the fork with the piece of steak on it, and some impractical instinct had me holding it up as a weapon. *“Oú suis-je?”* Dylan repeated, sitting up, and it hit me that he was speaking what sounded like French.

I didn’t know what to say, so I just knelt there in the floor, pointing the fork at him.

“I’m sorry, man.” He sat back again. “I musta fell asleep. Is that steak?”

Over the next hour or so, everything seemed to return to normal. I fed him the steak as we sat and watched Conan O’Brien, as well as a couple of microwaved bratwursts. About four in the morning I decided it was time to head back to bed. Before I went, I told Dylan that he was welcome to crash on my couch.

“You sure?”

“Of course.” I started to leave, but turned and told him, “When you dozed off earlier, you started speaking French.”

“French?” Dylan was dumbfounded. “I don’t know any French.”

Me and the bear stared at each other in confusion. I felt like I might be going crazy.

“I think I’m going to take a shower,” he said, getting up off the couch. “If I can’t get my dick out of this thing, I might as well take a shower. I stink.”

I didn’t ask him how he was going to take a shower with the bear suit on. To be honest I simply didn’t have the energy for that kind of logistical conversation.

This morning when I got up to get ready for work, Dylan was gone. I went to his place to see if he went home, but the door was locked and I beat on it for like twenty minutes.

I tried calling that Eric guy again from the landline in my apartment before I left—I wrote down his number while I had Steven’s phone at the hospital—but he’s not answering. So after work I’m going back to Roanoke, and back to that crazy-ass giant church to find his ass and make him tell me what’s up with this bear suit.

1nnb6o7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nnb6o7,AITAH for telling my friends first before confronting the other friend?,"One of my friends (19 M), we can call him Jay, and I (23 F) have been arguing about a situation that has two sides. This one’s going to be a doozy and I apologize for how long this might be. Jay and I became friends exactly 31 days ago. I haven’t known Jay for very long. Over the past couple weeks hanging out I have brought him around my close friend group. Let’s name them Sam (26 M), Tom (23 M) and Kris (22 M). I had some incidents with Kris before, making me think that he really does not like woman and he takes it out on me since I’m the only girl in the group. He always tried to throw insults at me but I would always shut them down. I’ve always been honest and there for him from day one. 

When me and Jay had our first interaction in person, we talked about our past relationships. He mentioned leaving his ex because she cheated on him multiple times, he became controlling, and didn’t like who he was becoming. I didn’t ask for many details and Jay never said anything further about what he meant. Jay said that he needs focus on growing as a person after all that trauma. So who is this girl? Jay told me that June(19 F) is his ex. Which to mine and his surprise, is my cousin. He said he didn’t know that we were related. My close friends always had a weird feeling about Jay from the start. Over time I started to see things in Jays behavior that made me uncomfortable. I did some more digging to find out if I’m the only one who feels this way. 

I’m typically someone who doesn’t keep things behind people’s backs and like to talk things out. People who know me, know this about me as I do it often. After thinking and talking to my close friends about it. I wrote a letter to Jay expressing how me and the others feel. 
To sum up my letter that I wrote to jay I said:
 “I need to be honest about how I’ve been feeling. Some of your comments come across as disrespectful or hypocritical, and they’ve started making people uncomfortable—we can’t tell if you’re joking or serious. You often dismiss others, instead of listening, and it makes me not want to open up anymore. At times, you act differently than what you preach, and it feels like you’re creating an image that isn’t real. Others in the group have also noticed this behavior and it’s caused tension. I don’t think it’s a good idea to keep bringing you around.” 

I then sent it to him. He nick-picked the paragraph without reading it all. Jay wanted to know who exactly have been saying these things about him. I told Jay “All of that and you’re more interested in who said what instead of how I and others felt? Someone’s who’s more interested about who’s saying things is someone who’s not willing to work on themselves.” Jay then said he’s too busy to craft a response and he will talk to me later. We left it at that and the day goes on without me hearing anything from Jay. 

Later that night, I was hanging out with my close friends. We decided to stop at a gas station and saw that Jay was there. We hung out there for some time away from Jay, then quickly headed out after our coffee. I see Jay is talking to two others that I’m not fairly close with. I got home and still havnt heard anything from Jay. 

As I’m getting ready for bed, my mom comes into my room and warned me about Jay. I’ve only spoken about Jay once to my mom. Then never again afterwards. My mom came home from hanging out with Junes family. Mom then asked me if I hang out with Jay. I said sometimes. She told me it’s probably best to not bring Jay around. That June was in an abusive relationship with him. He tried to control her about what she wears upon other things. Jay once pushed her into a wall while arguing. That Jay has done a lot of bad things, with June and her mom calling him a psychopath and a stalker. June and her family moved away because Junes mother didn’t want Jay finding out where they live and have a restraining order against Jay. Also Jay knew the entire time that I am Junes cousin. 

I was shocked. I then quickly went to the gc with my close friends being in the chat. No jay. I told them what just happened, I started ranting on about every detail about my experience. Tom then stated that he knew something was off about Jay from the beginning. With Sam backing him up. Tom then proceeded to say Jay was acting creepy recently and asking what Im gunna do now. I saw Kris popping in and out of the gc but saying nothing. I told them, I’m not sure but there’s always two sides of the story. Sam then said “Abuse and stalking is all i need to hear to be weary of him” I told Sam, “only if this is all true. We don’t know that for sure.” 

Seconds later while still in talking in the gc, Tom and I receive a text from Jay asking who’s talking bad about him. The only person who was in the gc that would tell Jay what’s going on, is I assumed Kris. I confronted Kris and he admitted to telling Jay the conversation we were having. Telling me that I’m talking bad about Jay. I told him I simply was not talking bad intentionally, I was talking about what happened. I wanted to get some advice from my close friends. I didn’t think Kris would immediately turn his back on me. I was going to confront Jay once I get more of a clear response crafted but Kris ran to Jay before we finished the conversation in the gc. I didn’t have the opportunity to talk to Jay yet. At this point the rest of the group are upset at Kris and Jay. I then got a call from Kris with Jay connected to the call. Accusing me of spreading lies, that “running my mouth to the group before talking to Jay was a shitty thing to do.” I told them I don’t see anything wrong with wanting to talk to them about it first before I say anything to Jay. I was looking for support. 
They then continued to tell me that I’m being fake, that I’m spreading false info, that June and her mother don’t like me and they are really bad people. 

Jay was tracking everybody that “might be involved in the gc” that night we ran into him at the gas station. Confronting people if they ever talked bad about him. Not knowing the gc is only just me and my close friends. Which I reminded him who was in the chat. I told Kris again I thought I could trust him. That I was going to talk to Jay but Kris beat me to it. I never said any of this was 100% true. They continued to talk over me to a point where I couldn’t get a word in at all. After hearing them belittle me, disrespect me and my family, I snapped. 

This is where I might have been the a hole. I told them “please shut the f*ck up and listen to me! You’re not letting me talk at all, where was I?” Kris then said “okay I’m done” then ended the call. I told both of them “do not expect me to respect you after disrespecting me.” 

It sounds like Jay is trying his best to cover up some things. With Kris being oblivious. Jay never said he didn’t abuse, stalk or did any of these bad things to June. Jay blew up at the fact that there was false info of a restraining order and that “nothings true”. I had enough, I messaged Junes mom myself. She said “everything is true but no restraining order at the moment but I said I will put a restraining order on him if he continues to act the way he was since the reasonings will be justified in court. He honestly is a bad guy, I wouldn’t let him get in your group”. 
So my mom misheard Junes mom. Thinking they already had it against him. I want to apologize to Jay and tell him that the restraining order is a misunderstanding but I don’t know if I should. Kris and Jay think I’m the ahole for telling, what I thought were my close friends, about the whole incident with what my mom said before talking to Jay first.

I vacationed here as a kid and it’s always stuck with me, so now that I’m retired it feels like the right time to come back.

My biggest non-negotiable is reliable high-speed internet. Cable at the very least, but ideally fiber. I know broadband coverage can vary by exact address, and I’d really like to hear which towns or neighborhoods have internet that actually stays up when a winter storm rolls through. Close behind that on my worry list is healthcare. I saw a post here from someone who languished trying to get help for their knee and finally went to MA to get diagnosed. I’m used to Boston-area access, where you can see a specialist or get diagnostics in days, not months. I don’t have big health needs right now, but I know that will matter more as I get older. For context, I currently pay about $1,400 a year for a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO plan in Massachusetts and I’d love to know what kind of experience people in Vermont have with availability and insurance options.

I’m leaning toward southern Vermont so I can stay within easy reach of my Massachusetts family.  Manchester or Dover have caught my eye but I’m open to anywhere that fits the bill. 

I’d like to be close enough to at least a supermarket and a handful of restaurants or shops. I’m not expecting the walkable convenience I have now in suburban Massachusetts, where I can stroll to coffee shops and grocery stores, but I’d rather not drive an hour just to pick up groceries.

One thing that surprised me as I’ve been reading posts here is the talk of traffic issues. Coming from Massachusetts that almost sounds funny, but I get that ski season, leaf-peeper weekends, and harsher winters can create their own headaches on the roads. And of course I’m curious about the other realities of living here year-round: how people handle snow removal and heating costs, what property taxes are like from town to town, and any of those little day-to-day details that only locals really know.

Like on the snow removal front I assume I can pay someone to plow the driveway. Though I’ve noticed paved driveways are not the norm, can those be plowed?

I currently live in a condo so I haven’t had to deal with snow removal….. ever, well with the exception of digging out. 

If you’ve made a similar move, or if you just have some lived-in Vermont wisdom I’d really appreciate your perspective.

and then everything is fake right? Also I'm on my parents insurance so I can't actually do anything and i'd rather not have a diagnosis of ANYTHING. I already technically have one with a therapist but if its not on insurance, nobody will ever know or care and if i want to immigrate it won't be an issue(yeah i get that having mental health issues from stress somehow even stress studying is a roadblock along the fact that i can't really move out right now but if my familly were to ever decide to move countries this would be a major. problem). Idk why i care cause they aren't going to move out unless the US decides to implode or something(likely wont but hey i saw this 1 doomer comment).

Anyone else? I mean I can theoretically walk in tomorrow and get the ball rolling but everything in me is also wary about it and it would be so much easier just to not do that. (but then thats just saying its easier not to do something that could potentially be beneficial?)

\*Jane\*

I didn't expect to spend my thirtieth birthday like this… at a party my Alpha mate had thrown ‘for me', watching him make a fool of himself with another woman on stage.

I clutched a glass of champagne tightly in my hand and my wolf growled to rip that bitch apart. Xander's shirt was half unbuttoned now, his tie long gone, and his cheeks were flushed from drinking too much whiskey. While his Beta Mia shamelessly wrapped her arm around his waist, her slender fingers dancing across his back. They sang together even if their voice was terrible.

She was younger than me, she wore a tight, low-cut dress. The red fabric clung to every curve of her body, the neckline plunging dangerously low. Her blonde hair flowed down her back, teasing my husband's skin every time they made physical contact.

Since three years ago, Mia replace her dead father as Xander's current beta and personal assistant,I watched their professional relationship gradually evolve into something. Little touches escalated into literal groping, small laughs escalated into inside jokes, and late nights at the office discussing ‘pack business' for some reason now required expensive champagne and takeout.

I looked around at the ‘Happy Birthday to My Luna' balloons decorating the room, how ironic.

Mia leaned against Xander, whispering something in his ear that made he threw his head back in laughter. He looked at her as if she was the funniest person.

I hadn't seen him this happy for a long time.

The last time was seven years ago at our mating ceremony, at that time, the light in his eyes only shining for me.

People around were all laughing but I knew they were actually mocking me. The pack Luna, sitting here while her Alpha pratically groped his Beta in front of everyone.

""Five bucks says Alpha Xander and Beta Mia will kiss before midnight,"" I heard a female voice said.

""Please,"" another one responded. ""They'll do more than just kiss. Have you seen the way he's looking at her?""

I turned around slowly to look at the people speaking, making sure to calm my features. It was two young members who had just joined our pack – a blonde and a brunette, both looking barely old enough to drink. I wasn't surprised, as only someone completely ignorant of the company hierarchy would say something like that in front of the Alpha's Luna.

When they finally noticed me staring, instead of showing appropriate respect, she tilted her head and arrogantly asked, ""Do you also work at Blackwood Group?""

I didn't respond. I just stared at them coldly.

Before I was about to retort words that would make them regret someone called out to me.

""Luna Jane! There you are, birthday girl!""

I knew who it was even before I turned. Gamma's daughter Giana. With a champagne flute in hand, her red lips stretched into what most would believe to be a friendly smile. But I knew better.

We all worked for the Blackwood Group, the world leading luxury jewelry company. It was part of being in the pack. Xander was of course as CEO and Alpha, Mia was his devoted beta and ‘indispensable' executive assistance, and Giana was the sales director. Her post was right below me, so she was one of the few people who called me by my name like a friend, even though we weren't friends.

""Giana,"" I nodded at her, as she stopped in front of me.

She air-kissed both of my cheeks, her expensive perfume practically choking me. ""Happy birthday! You have to tell me how it feels to be thirty.""

Don't worry, you'll find out soon, I wanted to say. But instead, I offered a fake smile.

""You know,"" she continued, ""Everyone has been asking about you all night. ‘Where's Luna?' ‘When do we get to speak with our Luna?'""

""Is that so?""

""Yes,"" she nodded, ""But it's so difficult for you to get any time with them. No opportunity to chat.""

Her eyes drifted to the stage, and Xander and Mia swayed together, sharing microphones and laughing like they were on a private date rather than a work event.

""By the way,"" Giana began. She dropped her head as if she were telling me a secret. ""What did you think about their performance? The Alpha and Beta have such… chemistry on stage, don't they?""

Damn bitch. She was mocking me.

Still, I managed a forced smile at Giana. ""That's great. I'm very happy with the surprise my husband prepared for me.""

Before she spit another vicious words, the guests erupted into applause around us for the performance of their Alpha and Beta. I guessed they were done with their nonsense.

But Xander brought the damn microphone back to his lips. ""Thank you, everyone. We're having such a great time that we're going to sing one more song. In honor of my Luna"" He said the last part and points at me.

More applause. More cheers. But I smiled stiffly. All I wanted to go home, and forget about this damn birthday.

Giana looked at me with pity. ""Well, ""she said. ""I'll catch up with you later."" She hurried off.

""Oh shit, she's Luna Jane? No way""

The two blond girls whisper again from behind me.

I turn again and glare at them the last time. They both awkwardly avert their gaze and quietly walk away.

Good.

I turned back to the stage, my heart pounding. The chords of Taylor Swift's ‘Love Story' began to play.

Mia's eyes locked with Xander's, and her hand was touching his arm, making my stomach twist. She was completely shameless, and he was too drunk to notice—or worse, he didn't care. I watched Mia's fingers leave my husband's arm, trailing lower and lower, and lower.

I finally snapped.

I let the empty champagne flute crash to the floor as I walked toward the stage. I could sense all eyes on me, the whispers dying down as they realized what's happening. They were waiting to see if I would break down, if the nominal Luna would finally drop the mask and accept Mia's humiliation.

But I didn't care. I was done playing the perfect Luna.

Xander didn't even look up when I stopped in front of them. Mia locked gazes with me, but instead of moving away from my husband, she simply straightened up, one hand still resting possessively on his thigh.

""Xander,"" I hissed. ""It's getting late. We should leave.""

He finally looked up, blinking in confusion.

""Leave?"" he slurred the words and gestured with his free hand. ""Come on, Jane. It's your birthday!""

Fuck the birthday.

""We. Are. Leaving,"" I said again. ""Now."" I repeated.

He mumbled like a baby and tries to pull me down to the floor ""Noo, Stay, Have fun with me, don't be such a wet blanket""

The annoyance was obvious in his voice. He looked at me like I was ruining the party.

I didn't say anything., walking backstage, my eyes landing on the event manager who'd been hovering near the sound booth.

""End it,"" I commanded immediately. ""Shut everything down. Now.""

He blinked at me. ""Luna Jane, the party is scheduled until…""

""I don't care when it's scheduled for,"" I cut him off, making him flinch. ""This is my birthday party, and I want it over. Cut the lights, stop the music. All of it.""

He nodded quickly and turned to the technicians, relaying my orders. Within seconds, the light dimmed, the music cut off mid-note and everywhere was silent.

When I walked back to center stage, all that was left was the sound of my high heels. I grabbed my husband's arm and pulled him firmly toward the edge of the stage. ""We're leaving,"" I said, loud enough for those nearby to hear.

Mia started saying something, but one look from me had her sinking back to the bench and shutting her mouth.

""Jane…"" Xander stuttered as he stumbled behind me. He was shocked by my sudden assertiveness, but I wouldn't engage. He was too drunk for me to argue with him.

As if he understood that I was in a sour mood, he became quiet. For once, I was the one in control.

I walked with Xander till we get to our car parked outside. Mike, our driver sees us coming and quickly rushes to open the back seat door. Then he helped me set Xander inside. I entered the passenger seat before slaming the door shut. I sighed, ""Take us home.""

Chapter 2: The Aftermath.

\*Jane\*

I couldn't sleep.

Xander was fast asleep beside me. He'd had no trouble nodding off, obviously not very concerned with the fact that he'd singlehandedly ruined my night.

I traced the sharp line of his jaw with my eyes, trying to search for evidence of his betrayal.

Just say a word, a name. That was all I want.

But there was nothing. Not even a twitch.

Of course not. Xander was extremely calculated, even in sleep. He always wanted to control everything, me included.

My eyes drifted to the dresser, where his phone kept lighting up. I looked back at Xander. Before I could convince myself not to, I reached for his cell.

It felt like I was committing a serious crime as I tapped my finger against the screen. It lit up, but Xander had taken the extra precaution by setting his notifications to private.

The only thing I could see was the sender, and all twenty-something texts… and counting were coming from the same person. I peered down at the profile picture. It was a tiny, blurry picture even though it looked like Mia.

I spent the entire night spiraling, replaying that horrible birthday party in my head, wondering what was really going on between Mia and Xander.

I eventually gave up on sleep, and dragged myself to the kitchen. By 6 a.m., I'd consumed three cups of coffee.

I looked up when the smell of mints came to my nose. Xander appeared in the kitchen doorway, dark hair disheveled, rubbing his temples.

""Morning,"" he mumbled, shuffling toward the coffee pot. ""Last night was great. You good?""

Was it? I wanted to ask, but instead, I answered, ""Just tired."" I'd tried to keep my voice steady, but the bitterness still managed to slip out.

Xander paused mid-sip, his gray eyes narrowing slightly over the rim of his mug. The kitchen suddenly felt too small, and the tiny peace I'd felt here has vanished completely.

""What's wrong, Jane?"" He dropped his voice, sounding more concerned than he really was.

What's wrong? I almost laughed. I gripped my mug tighter. ""I'm. Fine.""

He frowned again and set his coffee down. ""You don't sound fine."" He reached for the coffee pot, refilled his mug and slid into the chair beside me. ""Talk to me Jane.""

I turned to look at him. My husband. He was devastatingly handsome. Xander was almost a whole foot taller than me, towering over most of the pack. His dark hair fell in tousled waves, still messy from sleep. A lifetime ago, I would have buried my fingers in the silky strands and planted a sweet kiss on his full lips.

Now when I looked into his gray eyes, it felt like I was looking at a stranger. Even the strong line of his jaw, his usual early morning stubble that used to make my knees weak did nothing to me anymore.

As he gazed at me innocently, I found myself transported back to how we'd met at the Werewolf Academy. Eighteen-year-old Xander had been leaning against the brick wall right outside the dining hall. I'd barely even noticed him as I walked past, but he'd spotted me immediately and declared, ""You're mine.""

And like every typical sixteen year old would, I laughed in his face. I'd believed he was feeding me some elaborate line, toying with my feelings. I didn't even sense any sort of partner relationship between us.

""You're lying,"" I'd told him flatly. ""You don't even know me.""

But that didn't deter him. He spent months pursuing me relentlessly. He would slip notes into my textbooks, get me coffee, escort me to and from class. He was attentive, caring… just perfect.

I finally cracked and agreed to be his girlfriend. But with a condition. ""If I find my destined partner when I turn eighteen, I'm breaking up with you,"" I'd said to him. Xander grinned with so much confidence I almost took the words back. ""Agreed. But you won't want to.""

He was right. On my eighteenth birthday, when my wolf finally roared to summon her mate, I'd felt that unique sensation directed at none other than Xander. It made me the happiest person in the world.

Now, that memory tasted bitter in my mouth. It was tainted by his involvement with his Beta and how that had turned me into a laughing stock.

""You embarrassed me last night,"" I finally blurted. I set my mug down hard enough that coffee spilled over the rim. ""And what was that karaoke performance with Mia? Everyone was watching.""

His jaw tightened at the mention of her name. ""God, jane. You always do this… make trouble out of nothing.""

""Nothing? You think it's nothing?""

""Do you know how many women would kill for your life?"" He gestured around our large kitchen with its marble countertops and advanced appliances. ""I've given you everything. Luna title. This house. The cars. The vacations.""

What was he even talking about?

""And it's never enough."" He ran his hands through his hair in frustration. ""It's always Mia this, Mia that. She’s my Beta. I'm tired of it Jane. So damn tired.""

This was my fault now? After everything he'd put me through?.

I glared at him for a moment. But I also knew that if I pushed further, he'd reach for his phone and call my mother. She never took my side, and thought it was my luck to marry Xander. After all, she couldn’t live without Xander’s money.

“So how would you like me to show my gratitude, my lord?”

He sighed. ""I don't want to argue with you, Jane. Actually…"" he paused, straightening his shoulders. ""There's something I need to discuss with you. I've been thinking it's time.""

My stomach dropped. This was it. Xander was about to ask for a divorce. Mom was going to kill me. She already planned a vacation in Paris next month.

But when Xander opened his mouth, he said, ""I think we should consider an open marriage.""

I sat still, waiting for the punchline, because it had to be a joke. But his expression remained serious. It finally dawned on me. Xander was not joking.

""Absolutely not,"" I yelled. ""Are you out of your mind?""

""I'm not asking for your opinion, Jane. I'm telling you what's going to happen.""

I couldn't believe what was happening. A divorce would have been much better than this. But I just had to know… ""Why?""

He looked away before answering. ""I want a pup. It's been seven years. Blackwood couldn't be without an heir.""

My mouth flew open. Did he wake up with the sole purpose of hurting me? I knew what that statement meant. My inability to conceive had made me a failure. Eight rounds of IVF, eight times I'd put my body through hell, and eight times we'd failed.

""How dare you say that to me?"" I hissed. ""That's not my fault!""

""Jane… you need to calm down.""

""The doctor always says we're both healthy."" My voice broke. ""Just the embryos are… unusual.""

“It’s not my fault either. Maybe it’s just us together.”

I couldn’t believe he said that.

I reached for the buttons of my blouse, let it fall to the floor, stripping down until I was standing naked in front of him. ""I can try again."" I leaned into him, grabbed his hand and placed it over my chest. ""Does this not move you anymore?""

Xander's face hardened into something I didn't recognize.

“Jane” He snatched his hand away from me and rose to his feet. ""Put your clothes on, Jane. This isn't about sex."" He turned away from me as if the sight was distasteful and grabbed his keys from the counter.

I fumbled with my clothes. ""Where are you going?""

He didn't look back. ""Out!"" He walked away, toward the stairs.

""Wait,"" I shouted, my voice shaking.

Xander turned around, impatient. ""What?""

""Let’s do it. The open marriage.""

""Good"" He said before left.

\--

I spent the next couple of hours pacing in the kitchen, drowning myself in coffee while wild thoughts ran through my head. When the door finally opened again, I was sitting at the kitchen table, coffee mug in hand. Xander walked in first.

""Hey,"" I began. ""We should…"" I turned my attention back to the door at the sound of heels. Mia walked in, wearing her signature low-cut dress, wheeling a large suitcase behind her.

No.

""Jane,"" Xander said casually as if this was completely normal. ""Mia's moving in. She's my girlfriend now.""

I had always prided myself on my ability to remain calm regardless of what was going on. But for the first time in my life, I understood what it meant to want someone dead.

Chapter 3: Cast Aside.

\*Jane\*

When Mia stepped through the kitchen door, I was shocked and confused. The sight of her, grinning like this was her home. My wolf howled in outrage inside me. I couldn't believe he actually went through with this. I'd technically agreed to it, but I never truly thought he would bring her here. ""You can't be serious. Xander.""

""I'm very serious,"" he replied, taking Mia's suitcase and setting it down with a thud as if to say she was here to stay.

But she can't. I won't accept it. I moved to block the staircase. ""I'm the Luna of this pack and I won't allow it.""

They exchanged glances and simply walked around me like I was nothing more than furniture.

""I am your Alpha."" His alpha tone made me winch. ""It's my house. I provide you with a place to stay. If you don't like the arrangement, you're free to leave.""

I stood there, paralyzed to the spot. I replayed the entire morning in my head. How did things escalate so quickly?

As if they hadn't hurt me enough already, Mia turned to face me, her smile reeking of triumph. ""You'll need to move to the guest room, Jane. I'm not sharing a bed with you and Xander.""

I couldn't breathe. And what was even worse? Xander was right. I couldn't do anything about it.

I could only stand there, frozen and hollow as they disappeared into our bedroom. The door closed with a soft click that somehow felt worse than if it had slammed. I could hear them whispering and laughing, and that finally pulled me out of whatever kept me rooted in place.

I rushed through the hallway and out of the pack house, not bothering to close the door behind me. I stumbled into the garage, barely even standing on my feet.

Vitto, Xander's bodyguard, stood by the cars. His head snapped up as I walked in, eyes widening as he took in my disheveled appearance.

“Luna, you-”

I extended my trembling hand. ""The keys. I need the Rolls-Royce.""

His brows knitted together. ""Alpha Xander didn't mention…""

""The keys, Vitto,"" I commanded, adding more force to my voice. ""Now.""

He hesitated for a bit before retrieving them from the lockbox and handing it to me. I pulled it from his grasp and jumped into the car. Vitto's worried expression in my rearview mirror was the last thing I saw before reversing out of the garage.

I drove without destination for over an hour, mind spinning. All I could see was Xander and that bitch.

I'd planned to get a manicure today. I could firmly say that I was no longer in the mood. I couldn't help but wonder how long he'd been planning this. He'd mentioned open marriage just a couple of hours ago and now he'd actually brought his lover home.

What disturbed me the most was how empty I felt inside. I couldn't cry. Couldn't scream. I was numb. My previous pack psychologist had called it a ‘defense mechanism.' ""You're denying your true feelings,"" she'd insisted during our sessions. ""Cry it out, Jane""

She might have been right, but right now, I didn't want to pay attention to anyone's opinion.

I just wanted a drink.

Without overthinking it, I pulled the car into the hidden lot behind Moonfall. I'd discovered the bar three years ago after a particularly vicious fight with Xander. This place has become my favorite bar since then. It was located on the very outskirts of werewolf city, hidden down an unmarked road. Particularly, there were no paparazzi lurking around, meaning no headlines like, ""Blackwood Pack's Luna Spotted Drinking Alone, Rumored Marriage Trouble with Alpha Xander.""

The moment I pushed the door open, the scent of shape-shifters from various clans hit me. Here, pack hierarchies and politics didn't matter, we were just ourselves. Unlike the pretentious establishments in the city where werewolves flaunted their status and treated other shapeshifters with disdain, Moonfall welcomed all.

I slid onto the leather barstool and caught the bartender's eye. ""Whiskey. Neat. And keep it coming.""

The bear shifter bartender, a huge man with a thick beard nodded and placed a heavy crystal tumbler in front of me. He poured my drink and leaned forward. ""Rough day?""

I took a long sip, sighing as the liquor burned the back of my throat. ""Not interested in talking.""

He shrugged. ""Fair enough. Name's Bob if you change your mind.""

I nodded at him and went back to my drink. I understood bartender's liked to listen to customer's, but now, I just wanted to lick my wounds alone.

I'd just finished my second drink when strong arms suddenly wrapped around me from behind. I stiffened instantly.

""Kate! There you are, sweetheart!"" A foreign deep voice said almost too loudly, as if he wanted someone to hear him.

The tall, handsome stranger slid onto the stool beside me. He smelled of pine forests after rain, a scent that made my wolf stir with unexpected interest. He was a werewolf too. I looked up at him, and almost did a double take. He was handsome, painfully so.

He had raven black hair, dreamy blue eyes, full kissable lips, set into what looked like a permanent smile. He was looking at me in such a way that almost made me weak in the knees. Almost.

The man suddenly leaned in close, grabbing my hands. ""Play along. I'll explain later.""

Before I could respond, a furious looking woman stormed across the bar toward us. ""Aaron!"" she snapped. ""So this is why you've been ignoring my calls?""

The stranger, Aaron, tightened his grip on me. ""You shouldn't be doing this in front of my wife.""

I didn't think her voice could get louder, but it did. ""Your wife?!""

He lifted my left hand where Xander's wedding ring was. ""Yes, Hazel. My wife.""

Her face suddenly twisted in disgust as she turned to face me. ""Seriously? You married this scumbag?""

""Hey!"" Aaron yelled. ""You can't talk to my wife like that.""

But her attention didn't shift from me. ""You can't see what your jerk of a husband did?"" I stared blankly at her, waiting for her to explain. ""He disappeared after we slept together. Not even a text! Just vanished like it meant nothing!""

Aaron looked deep into my eyes and brought my hands to his chest. He was trying real hard to sell this apologetic husband story. Xander needed to learn a thing or two from him. ""Because it didn't mean anything,"" Aaron replied, his eyes still on mine. ""It was a one-night stand. Just one night.""

""You absolute jerk! You made me believe…""

He held up a hand. ""I never promised you anything.""

""Go to hell,"" she spat at him. And then she turned to face me, eyes filled with pity and contempt. ""Good luck with your marriage to this piece of trash."" She stormed toward the exit, shouldering past a group of fox shifters.

Everything happened so fast that I sat frozen, my whiskey completely forgotten.

Aaron released my hand and exhaled dramatically. ""Thank the moon goddess that's over."" He ran his fingers through his dark hair. ""Sorry about dragging you into that. She's been following me for weeks. Showed up at my workplace yesterday.""

I blinked at him, still trying to process what had just happened. The confrontation had pulled me out of my misery for a moment, but I could feel it returning slowly.

He turned toward the bar, lifting his hand to signal Bruno. ""Let me buy you a drink. You definitely earned it, playing along like that.""

I stared at him, then glanced toward the door where Hazel had disappeared. The whole encounter had lasted maybe two minutes, but I was still dumbfounded.

My glass was empty. My marriage was in shambles. What could I possibly lose by having a drink with a handsome stranger? ""Let's get two glasses.""

Aaron grinned at me then turned to Bob. ""Two glasses it is.""

Chapter 4: A Crazy Plan.

\*Aaron\*

I could sit here and say that recruiting the help of this woman in avoiding Hazel was all a crazy coincidence, but that would be a lie.

I spotted her the moment I walked into the bar. She wasn’t just the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen, she was unique. Her scent hit me suddenly, almost knocking off the fragile bar stool. My wolf howled inside me, clawing at my chest in a way I hadn’t felt in years. I shifted uncomfortably, surprised by my reaction.

The platinum band had been a disappointing surprise. Whoever her husband was, he better thank the moon goddess. He’s a damn lucky bastard.

The last time my wolf had been this restless was the night I met my mate Yve.

“I don’t think we’ve been introduced. I’m Aaron.”

“I gathered.”

Right. Hazel had been yelling my name with so much rage. “Great. It’s only fair if you tell me yours… even the playing field a little.”

She finally turned to face me, assessing me quietly. She said nothing, her eyes meeting mine for a second, maybe two. But it was enough.

Her lips parted slightly and I caught myself staring, mesmerized by the subtle curve of her mouth.

Shit. She probably thinks I was trying to flirt with her. I raised my hands in mock surrender, leaning away from her. “Just to be clear, I’m not trying to flirt. Women are…” I chuckled, shaking my head, “frankly, troublesome.”

She arched an eyebrow, letting me know I’d said the wrong thing. “Right,” she said flatly. “You just happened to use a complete stranger as a shield against some innocent ex. Because all men are the same, aren’t they?”

Before I could defend myself, she turned away, reached for her glass of whiskey sitting on the bar and downed it in one gulp. My eyes widened, but I decided it was smart not to comment on it.

It had been exactly three weeks since I’d moved out of Claudia’s apartment and into this crumbling, half-condemned corner of Los Angeles. The kind of neighborhood people warned you about on online forums and true crime podcasts. Stray dogs howled at night. Power flickered if you dared to microwave something. The streets had more cracks than pavement, and the buildings leaned like they were whispering secrets to each other.

But no matter how hostile or decayed this place felt, it was still safer than where I came from.

We were supposed to start a new life here. Me and Claudia. A life in California, under big skies and second chances.

It’s not something I talk about because who would believe a 5’10 man over a 5’1 woman?

She didn’t hurt me with fists. It was all with words—meticulously cruel ones. She had a gift for it. A scalpel for a tongue. She called it “just being honest,” but honesty doesn’t leave you crying in parking lots, questioning your entire worth.

Claudia humiliated me every chance she got. She weaponized my vulnerabilities, the ones I gave her willingly, lovingly. She called me pathetic in front of her friends. She laughed at me in text threads she forgot to hide. And when I tried to leave, she got worse. Spiteful. Vindictive. She emptied my bank account under the excuse of needing money for her singing career, which never took off. Because let’s face it, the woman has about as much discipline as a wet sock.

Now I am here. Three weeks in. Barely surviving.

The only thing holding me together was the tiny gym in the basement of my crumbling apartment complex. The weights were rusty, the air was stale, and the mirrors warped. Strangely, there was a considerable number of weights. And there was enough weights here to complete my circuits. Since I couldn’t afford BJJ classes, lifting plates and doing reps was all I could do against the creeping madness of being twenty-four, broke, and completely alone.

I had nothing to show for anything but an associates degree and an academic dismissal record from UCLA, another one of Claudia’s many legacies. I had done well in community college back home in Florida, getting high marks. But all of that was over now.

As I finished my final overhead press, a deep tremor shook the building. The plates on the rack rattled like teeth. It was the third one that week. They had to be earthquakes. This city was after all sitting on the San Andreas fault.

The scientists on the news speculated it was subsidence. That they were “shifting fault lines,” they and “underground instability due to water tables.” But these tremors felt too light, too sporadic, and too deliberate to be natural.

Squishy, writhing sounds were reported to have been heard along with the tremors by utility workers both on the surface and below ground. There were whispers of shadows moving in sinkholes, of screeching that didn’t sound human. But nothing was verified.

Before I could contemplate any of this further, I heard the door open.

I looked over and saw tanned skin, twin braids, black yoga shorts and a burgundy sports bra that framed her like she was carved from marble. Her eyes were soft but alert, deer-like. Her body was chiseled and toned, like that of a CrossFit instructor. Abs were slightly visible on her midriff.

She didn’t notice me as she walked past with her air pods in, stretching absently. As I moved through my circuit, I caught her reflection in the warped mirrors and caught her glancing at me too.

Thirty minutes later, I was done. As I made for the door, I passed one last mirror.

Our eyes locked. I then caught a ghost of a smile as I glanced into the mirror. Was that directed at me? I didn’t see anyone else besides the two of us in that tiny gym.

I didn’t think too much of it as I hauled myself back up the stairs and let myself into my apartment, muscles sore from all the weightlifting. The next morning, I was up early. Not that I could sleep very well, let alone need an alarm clock. The nightmares did a better job waking me up.

The tremors continued, still not showing patterns typical to earthquakes. They came in pulses, like breathing. Like something under us was stretching, waking up.

A baby’s cry jolted me upright. The sound came from outside my apartment.

I stepped out onto the narrow balcony. And there she was. The CrossFit lady from last night.

She sat on the porch next to mine, holding a softly crying baby close to her chest. No makeup now. Just sweatpants, a faded tank top, and those same braids trailing down her shoulders. Her tattoos were more visible now: a winding snake disappearing under the waistband of her pants, a mandala design on her shoulder, and just beneath her collarbone, a compass inked in black.

We locked eyes.

I braced for the usual gestures I get from girls. The eyerolls, turn aways, maybe a muttered “what are you looking at?” as they glared at me.

But I was stunned when she smiled at me. Her expression was warm and welcoming. Her nose piercing glistened in the dawning light. She raised her tiny hand in a gentle wave.

“Hi,” she chirped with a slight pink hue washing over her cheeks.

I blinked, returning a crooked smile while waving back awkwardly. “H-hey.”

“You new around here?” she asked, voice low, almost lyrical. She sounded American, but something in her tone hinted at roots further south.

“S-somewhat.”

She held my gaze, and her smirk. “Me too. Moved in two days ago.”

Her phone slipped from her pocket. “Ugh.” She leaned over to grab it, and I caught another tattoo along her spine. It was some kind of text. Foreign. Faded. Like a scar she made beautiful.

The ground trembled again—more forcefully this time. A soft *crack* echoed nearby. Somewhere close, maybe beneath us, something shifted.

She flinched. Just slightly.

“You feel that?” I asked.

She nodded slowly. “Yeah. I have.” She said slightly rocking her baby.

We stood there in silence; the air was tight with a hint of unease.

I rubbed the back of my neck and adjusted my tie. “Please excuse me. But I must get going.”

Her mouth curved into a wider smile, teeth glistening in the light. “Have a good day, Papi.”

I nervously glanced back and peeped a silent thanks as I walked away. I felt my cheeks flush a dark shade of red. If she called me Papi one more time, I swear I was going to melt into a gooey puddle on the floor. I walked to work like I always did. Four miles through a city that seemed to sag more with every step. The sidewalks had new cracks. Light poles leaned slightly further. Somewhere in the distance, I saw a patch of sidewalk that seemingly dipped into the ground.

A city utility truck was parked next to it, but no one was working. The cones had just been haphazardly placed there seemingly without thought. The caution tape attached nearby was fluttering like poorly poled flags.

I didn’t stop. I never did. When your life is unraveling, the best you can do is keep moving forward and pretend you’re still part of the world.

My job was at a massive, two-story building on the edge of the industrial district. It was a plain, mostly windowless two-story building located at the middle of assfuck metropolitan nowhere. The building is made of faded stucco and industrial concrete. It was designed more like a prison than a place where people worked eight hours a day.

From the outside, it looked like a cheaply built, square-shaped building with brutalist architecture. But inside, it was a labyrinth of cubicles stretching into fluorescent infinity. Dozens upon dozens of people sat in their little gray pens, their voices rising and falling like radio static as they answered calls, took complaints, and tried not to scream.

Thank God I didn’t work on the phones. I had my associate’s degree, which meant I was just qualified enough to be buried under spreadsheets instead of voicemails.

The front doors slid open, doors screeching slightly against the floor. I was immediately hit with the scent of burnt coffee and printer toner. The hum of bad lighting and worse ventilation in this makeshift warehouse-like building settled into my bones like it always did. This place didn’t just feel like a prison—it *was* one. A beige coffin they paid us to climb into for eight hours a day.

I remembered what one of the phone reps had once joked that working at a call center is like being in a prison they pay you to be at.

“Bout time you dragged your sorry behind in here, Martin,” chuckled a voice from behind the receptionist's desk.

It was Angela.

The office secretary—and unofficial queen of sarcasm. A short, sharp-tongued African American woman in her twenties with perfect eyeliner, impossibly long nails, and a voice that could cut through drywall. She had a gold tooth that glinted every time she smiled.

“You tryna set a record for ‘most zombies avoided during a morning commute’ or what?” she said, raising one painted brow.

“Maybe.” I muttered, cracking a smile despite myself.

She nodded once. “Mhm. You look like you fought off three sinkholes and a bad haircut on the way here.”

She wasn’t wrong. I nevertheless gave her a mock salute and headed toward the accounting corner. My cubicle was in the back left corner of the building, away from the worst of the call center noise but close enough to hear it leak through the thin walls. The overhead fluorescents buzzed like dying flies.

I sat down at my desk, logged in, and opened my first spreadsheet of the day. Line after line of vendor totals, expenses, revenues, balance reconciliations, and overdue reimbursements. The kind of mindless repetition that blurred the hours and dulled your soul in equal measure. $16.50 an hour. No benefits. No 401(k). Just the soft promise that if I stayed long enough, I might get a .50 cent raise.

My boss, Martha, made her appearance around 9:30 AM. I heard her before I saw her—heels clicking down the linoleum like gunshots. Martha was Jamaican, in her early fifties, with close-cropped hair, brilliant earrings, and a laugh that came out like a punchline to a joke you weren’t sure you wanted to hear. She had a gold tooth like Angela, but hers caught the light like a warning. She had a wicked, dark sense of humor that made some people uncomfortable—but I liked it.

“Martin,” she said, peeking over my cubicle wall like a cat scoping prey. “You still alive?”

“For now,” I muttered, fingers tapping numbly at my keyboard.

“Good. Keep it that way. Dead men don’t process expense reports.”

She laughed to herself and sauntered off, leaving the faint scent of her cocoa butter lotion.

The day dragged on like it always did. Coffee. Data entry. Boring emails. Then more spreadsheets. But sometime around noon, the power flickered. The monitors blinked. The lights overhead dimmed for a heartbeat.

No one said anything. Everyone just froze for a moment. A few of us glanced around the low ceiling and suffocated claustrophobic walls around us, eyes darting around. After a minute or two of eerie stillness, the murmurs and mutterings between friends and coworkers continued as people resumed their calls and activities.

Eight hours later, my shift ended, and I went over to my locker in the common area where you had to surrender your belongings before being let into the facility. I took out my bag and changed out of my work clothes into athletic wear. I immediately hit the streets and began my two-mile walk; I wanted to get home before sunset.

As I proceeded down the street, I walked up a rather steep ramp that had a view of both the overpass, along with the beach and the green hills just below the horizon. As I passed by one intersection, my eyes twitched slightly at the sight of what I was seeing as my eyes scanned the horizon below. The homeless camps looked as if they were bunched further together, as if they were somehow being pushed together.

It was subtle. The kind of change you'd only notice if you saw the place every day like I did. Tents that once stood apart now pressed shoulder to shoulder, like frightened animals. And where there had once been trash fires and voices, there was now silence and smoke that curled in tight spirals.

I stopped walking. Something about it gnawed at the back of my brain. Then the ground beneath me *twitched*.

Not a quake. Not the full-body shake of tectonic plates rubbing together. This was sharper. Quicker. Like something huge had just *moved* underneath the concrete—shifted its weight and went still again.

I looked around. A few cars passed by on the overpass above, indifferent. A cyclist swerved wide to avoid a pothole and didn’t even flinch. I rubbed my eyes. Maybe I was tired. Maybe my brain was trying to make sense of the caffeine crash and the flickering lights from earlier.

As I kept walking, the sky was melted into a deep orange, then red, the kind of sunset that looked like the world had been dipped in fire. Shadows stretched out in strange ways—longer than they should’ve, curling and jagged, bending against the grain of the buildings.

I treaded up the sidewalk, the soles of my sneakers tapping softly against the cracked concrete. The sun had nearly dipped behind the hills, bleeding amber and violet across the sky like bruises. The air smelled faintly of salt, sweat, and ozone.

And once more—I saw her. The Hispanic woman from the gym.

She was coming down the slope toward the apartment complex, her hands lightly gripping the handles of a black stroller. Her infant daughter was bundled inside, tiny fists rising and falling as she dozed.

She wore yoga shorts and a fitted sports bra, her figure lean and powerful, like someone who worked hard for her peace. Her long dark hair was braided into two tight plaits, and her skin glowed golden in the dying light.

She tilted her head just a little, and her mouth curved into a warm, quiet smile. A genuine one. The kind that felt like it didn’t get used enough but hadn’t forgotten how.

“Hey,” she said softly, her smile brightening.

“H-Hey,” I stammered, nearly tripping on a raised section of sidewalk.

“Just getting back from work?” she asked.

I nodded. Too hard. “Yeah.”

She didn’t flinch at my awkwardness. Didn’t look away.

“How was your day?”

I forced a smile. Tried to hold myself together like I hadn’t been unraveling all day.

“It was… predictable, I guess.”

She let out a small laugh. It was light and real and made something flicker in my chest I didn’t want to name.

“Predictable means stable,” she said with a ghost of a smile tugging at her lips.

“I-I-I…” I rubbed the back of my neck, heat crawling into my cheeks. Jesus. Me and my neurodivergent slow brain. Hesitating, flailing, stammering like a car with octagon wheels,

She tilted her head again, studying me. Not with judgment, but curiosity. Like she was waiting for me to catch up to myself.

“I should get going,” I said. I didn’t mean it, not really. I just didn’t know how to handle standing in front of a woman who looked like she walked off the cover of Vogue and spoke to me like I was worth her time. But instead of brushing it off or saying goodnight, she looked at me and asked looking up at me with a pouty lip and puppy eyes: “Do you want to walk with me?”

I blinked. The baby stirred slightly in the stroller.

My brain tripped over itself, repeating old advice: *Don’t date single moms. It’s complicated. You’re not ready. She’s out of your league.*

Then, the voice that had been whispering in my ear for months—*You’re broken, no one wants you, you’re not enough*—suddenly fell silent.

“...S-sure,” I said.

Her smile returned, cheekbones pressed higher on her face. She turned, and I fell in beside her.

The sidewalk curved gently toward the complex, and as we walked, I noticed how quiet the evening was. No dogs barking. No traffic. No laughter from the playground up the block. Just the crunch of gravel beneath our feet, and the low creak of the stroller wheels.

“So… what do you do?” she asked.

“I’m in accounting,” I said. “At a call center. Not glamorous. What about you?”

“I work full time at a warehouse. I’m a supervisor.” she said.

I nodded. “You seem like you’re… good at it.”

“I try.” She looked down at her daughter with a quiet affection. “She’s my ‘why.’”

There was a silence after that, but not a bad one. A soft one.

Then, just as we reached the gate of the complex, the ground beneath us gave a sudden, short *jolt*. The stroller’s wheels bounced slightly. I reached out instinctively, steadying it before it could tip.

Her eyes darted to me. “Another one?”

“Yeah…” I said slowly. “Felt that one under my feet.”

“That’s the third time this week.”

“It’s weird. Doesn’t feel like earthquakes. More like… movement.”

We both turned and looked back toward the hill, toward the horizon where the last sliver of sun dipped beneath the horizon.

And for just a second, I thought I saw something *shift* in the asphalt far up the road. Like the street itself had *breathed*. Her hand tightened slightly on the stroller.

We sat on an old wooden bench near the entrance to the apartment courtyard, just beyond the iron gate that never quite latched right. The stroller was parked beside us, the baby asleep and swaddled in a soft yellow blanket, her breathing slow and even.

The air had cooled just enough to raise goosebumps, the pavement still radiating the day's heat in long, tired exhales. Above us, the sky had gone a shade darker, stars struggling to break through the haze of city light. She leaned back on the bench, braids falling over her shoulders. She then tilted her face to the sky like someone trying to remember what peace felt like.

“My name’s Rosa,”

“Martin.”

She let off a light toothy smile.

I tilted my head and asked. “Where are you from?”

“I’m from El Salvador,” she began. “My family… they weren’t safe.”

I sat still, letting her speak, Tilting my head slightly.

“My cousin was murdered when I was seventeen. Shot in front of our house by some gang guys. I think it was a message. Something about turf. No one ever explained it, not really.”

My eyes widened slightly.

“A man offered to get me out. Said he would sponsor me. That I could send money home. He made it sound like salvation.”

“But when I got here,” Her lips pursed, and her voice got heavy. “It wasn’t long before they started shuttling me around to various hotels around California. They drugged me, tattooed me, beat me.” I could see the tears coming down her cheeks.

I tilted my head as a breeze moved through the park. The leaves rustled just slightly.

“His name was Diego. He’s MS-13. A shot-caller, I think. Women were like currency to him.” She then looked down at her stroller. “I got pregnant, and he got worse. Possessive. Violent. I left when I was seven months in. Hid in a homeless shelter for weeks.”

I held a hand to my mouth. “God.”

She took a breath, steadied herself. “They helped me file for something called a T visa. For survivors of trafficking. I had to tell them everything. About Diego. About the others. I still get calls from law enforcement sometimes, asking for more names.”

I just stared at her. I didn’t say a word. I didn’t know much about immigration laws. I just knew that many of the workers at the call center spoke broken English and I’m highly confident many were not here legally.

“Those let you stay for four years. After three, you can apply for permanent residency if you’ve cooperated and stayed clean?” I asked.

She nodded. “That, and my daughter was born here.”

Another silence passed, this one thicker. Then she turned her gaze to me. “What about you?”

I shifted on the bench. “What about me?”

“What are *you* running from?”

I frowned and furrowed my eyebrows. “Her name was Claudia. She… she said a lot of things. Most of them stuck.”

I stared down at my hands. The words came slowly in a tone that was laced with both sorrow and grief. “She’d call me names. Said I was broken. That I wasn’t enough. That no one would ever want me. Said I was too weird. Too robotic. That my voice made her want to scream. She used to make fun of the way I stim. Or the way I go quiet when there’s too much noise.”

Rosa’s jaw dropped slightly.

“She said I was on the spectrum and that no one would love someone like that. Like me.”

Rosa tilted her head, raising an eyebrow. “L-like you? On the spectrum?”

I let off a deep sigh. “I’m … on the spectrum.”

“That explains a few things. So let me guess, she weaponized it?” Rosa said, her voice a blade.

“Yeah. But I thought it was love, so I stayed. I kept trying to be better. Quieter. Less… me.”

Rosa reached out and touched my hand. Her fingers were rough with calluses but gentle. I looked over to her and we locked eyes. She wore no makeup, eyeliner, or blush, not that she needed it. God, this woman was gorgeous. I just stared at her, feeling her hand on mine. I then placed my hand on hers. Rosa’s smile grew wide and glistening.

The ground beneath us tremored slightly. We both looked around frantically. Rosa held onto the stroller a little more tightly.

I shook my head. “I'm no geologist, but that didn’t feel like an earthquake.”

She took her hand off mine and held it to her head. “I-I have a lot of laundry to do. I need to get going. Ill see you later!”

“Hey wait!”

She looked back at me, grip maintained on the stroller.

“I actually have laundry to do to. Would it be okay if…” I struggled to get the words out.

Her frown quickly turned into a smirk. “Join me? While doing laundry?” she then laughed.

I felt my cheeks flush. “Forget it. It was a dumb ques-”

“No, it’s okay. It can get pretty lonely at the laundromat. I could use the company.” She said with a glistening grin.

Later that evening, we both went to the laundromat. We both had a large stack of clothes we needed to take care of. The TV in the complex laundromat window glowed blue through the entire room. We were both loading up laundry into the machine.

Just then, a breaking news banner crawled across the bottom of the screen.

**""Violence in South L.A. linked to suspected MS-13 resurgence—multiple stabbings, one missing person, bodies found near riverbed.""**

Rosa turned her attention away from the thong, and me. Her eyes locked onto the screen, her lips pressed into a thin line.

Her voice was quiet. Controlled. “They’re moving again.”

I looked at her. “You think it’s Diego?”

She didn’t answer right away. “It could be him. Or someone he knows. If he knows where I am...”

I saw it. Just for a second. The crack in her armor.

We stood there under the flickering laundromat light, the hum of bad wiring vibrating faintly in the silence. Then she turned to me, her expression different now. Measured, careful.

“Would you... feel comfortable staying with me tonight?”

My brain stuttered. “Wh-what?”

She rubbed her arm. “If you, you wouldn’t mind. Its just… so I can feel safe.”

I stood there and stared at her for what felt like hours. The memories crept inside my head like a parasitic amoeba.

“Martin?” she tilted her head. “Are you alright?”

I shook my head. “Y-yeah I’m fine. Are you sure you’re okay with that? I-I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable.”

She giggled. “I’ll be fine. I don’t bite.”

She gave a small nod and motioned toward the stairwell. We moved quietly, the creaking of the old stairs somehow louder in the dark. When we reached her apartment, she unlocked the door, nudged it open, and stepped aside for me. It was small but clean. The baby was still asleep in her stroller. Rosa gently lifted her into a small bassinet tucked in the corner of the bedroom.

“You can set your stuff down anywhere,” she said, slipping off her sandals.

I hovered awkwardly just inside the doorway, my eyes flicking to the bed. It was modest, with a thick comforter and a small lamp on the nightstand.

“Do you...” Rosa said slowly, turning toward me, “feel okay sharing the bed?”

I hesitated. “I—I’ve never done that before.”

She blinked. “You’ve never shared a bed with a girl?”

I shook my head. “I mean... I’ve dated. But I was always guilted into sleeping on the couch. She said I breathed too loud.""

Rosa stared at me for a long moment, her face unreadable.

“She made me feel like a parasite,” I added quietly. “Even when I wasn’t doing anything wrong.”

She looked like she wanted to say something but didn’t. Instead, she came from the other room after setting Sofia in her crib. She climbed into her side of the bed. “There’s space,” she said, patting the spot next to her.

I stood frozen for a second longer, then moved slowly, sitting on the edge of the mattress like it might give out under me. I kicked off my shoes and lay back stiffly, arms crossed over my chest like a mummy. Rosa wrapped her arm around me, snuggling up to me closely, burying her face in my neck.

The ceiling was dim. My breath was too loud in my ears. I could feel Rosa, however, soundlessly giggling and smiling into my neck.

Then, the flashbacks came.

*“You’re just... so needy all the time, Martin. It’s exhausting.”*

*“Do you even know how to be normal? Like, just for a day?”*

*“You should be grateful someone like me even talks to you.”*

My jaw clenched. I felt like I was underwater again, drowning in the echoes.

I blinked and saw Claudia’s face in my mind, twisted with scorn. The smell of wine on her breath. The way she used to smile *after* the cruelty.

“Martin?”

Rosa’s voice pulled me back, but I didn’t answer right away.

I was still there—on that couch, arms wrapped around my knees, hoping silence would make the yelling stop.

“Martin,” she said again, softer this time. Her hand gently touched my arm. I flinched.

“Sorry.” I breathed, moving to the edge of the bed, back facing her.

“Sorry? For what?” she asked, lying towards me.

I pressed my fingers to my temples. “I-I-I-” I couldn’t get the words out.

“It’s okay. It will be okay.” She said tightening herself to me like a koala bear. “Just hold me please.”

I sighed and turned around to face her. Slowly. We lay there for a while in silence, both of us lying there, eyes closed, lights off. A distant siren echoed, and underneath it...A *low* rumble. Deep. Faint. Like something was dragging itself slowly beneath the city’s skin. Neither of us spoke. But we both heard it.

She gently pushed me onto the bed. I swallowed hard and adjusted myself accordingly. She slid next to me and clambered onto me like a koala bear, burying her face in my neck. I could feel her breathing into me as she giggled.

The next morning, the sky was chalky, bruised yellow. I gingerly let myself out the door, glancing over my shoulder at a sleeping Rosa, and then over to the nursery where baby Isabella was. I carefully walked down the uneven stairs of the apartment complex, trying not to wake the baby.

“Please come home.” I faintly heard her mutter under her breath as I left the room.

But upon traversing onto the street, my eyes set upon the streets before me, and a creeping dread settled into my gut.

The roads, tarmac and pavement before me warped like old skin, looking a lot more disjointed than they did yesterday. Cracks widened overnight, becoming jagged, dark, and *wet*. The asphalt peeled back in long, curling strips like snakeskin. Trash cans, mailboxes and other utilities lay toppled over. Their contents spilled over onto the streets or otherwise half-swallowed by shallow depressions and potholes in the ground. Pigeons, crows and other birds picked at food wrappers, then flew back into the sky. As the familiarity of my surroundings settled into my senses, a cold dread settled into my gut as the realization about my usual route fell upon me like a ten-ton anvil.

**There were sinkholes, everywhere. A lot more than yesterday.**

But three of them had appeared near the bus stop I normally passed, gaping like open mouths.  
One was filled with murky water while the other two were just dark. But the most unsettling thing about the area was that there were no signs, no cones, or indeed, the presence of very many utility workers. There was just spray paint on the concrete in orange that read “TEMP CLOSED” in a rush-job scrawl. I nevertheless resumed my walk to the call center, treading carefully along the pavement.

I arrived at the call center a half hour later.

Security gates didn’t buzz open anymore; they were just left ajar. I just walked on by. I immediately noticed the parking lot only had a fifth of the automobiles that were normally there. When I entered, the fluorescents inside flickered like the pulse of something sick. It was hot, scorching hot, like the air conditioning stopped working. It was like walking into an oversized oven.

It also felt eerie. Namely because there was no good reason to miss work or school today. There were no incoming natural disasters or orders from the state government to evacuate. Yet people were seemingly bolting without permission from anyone. I didn’t even need to swipe my badge to get in. The call center’s main lobby, normally buzzing with noise, energy and life, today was empty.

There was no receptionist. No coffee machine hum. No quiet morning chatter. Just silence.

I made my way to the second floor where most of the windows were. The overhead lights buzzed faintly. Only a few desks were occupied, scattered like survivors. Of the forty or so people who normally made up the floor, I counted **less than ten.** And close to all of them were not their usual selves. Even the loud, cheerful ones looked haunted.

I noticed one woman with pale, sunken eyes. Another woman was visibly shaking, hands wrapped around a Styrofoam cup that had long since stopped steaming as she stared mindlessly at her screen.

I passed by Mitch from sales. Normally boisterous and rowdy what being he was in sales. Always showing off sports stats. Today, he stared at his screen like it was the edge of a cliff.

“Mitch?” I asked.

He glanced up at me, then his attention went back to the screen.

“You hear about Greta?”

I shook my head.

“She saw the ground swallow a whole house. Right near her condo. She said she could hear people screaming, but there was nothing she could do. The road looked like soup. She quit. Took off last night without even a notice. She didn’t even pack her stuff.”

He turned to me, slowly. His eyes were *red*. Not just tired—bloodshot and threaded like something had broken in him.

“This place… it’s not safe anymore. Not this city. Not this building. You feel it?”

I nodded. It was becoming painfully obvious.

Later that morning, I passed by the security desk again. The guard—Camilla, a usually chipper girl—was slumped forward in her chair, watching grainy camera feeds twitch with static.

I asked her about the missing people. About the roadblocks, and the sinkholes. She didn’t answer at first. Just kept watching the feed.

Then, without looking at me, she said: “We can’t stay here.”

I blinked. “What?”

She finally looked at me. Her eyes were *too dry.* Like she hadn’t blinked in hours. She turned back to the monitors.

“Get out while you can.” She said in a low, yet unassuming voice. “Tomorrow. Preferably tonight.”

I shook my head. “The paychecks get processed tomorrow.”

She glanced over at me, expression hardened as he slowly shook his head. “Another hundred dollars doesn’t mean shit when you’re dead. I know what I’m doing. Mama lives in Nevada.”

I didn’t pay too much heed. I just went over to my desk and resumed my duties as usual. I was busy as usual. But I noticed that new work was not coming down the pipeline and into my inbox. My boss wasn’t looking over my shoulder or sending me emails like she normally did. Indeed, I haven’t run into her at all since I came in this morning.

Before I knew it, it was five. I clocked out and headed out the door. The security guard I passed earlier wasn’t there, and the building felt even more empty than this morning. It was so quiet I could hear my own voice bounce off the walls. I felt the ground below me lightly shake, but it was followed by a slithering, writhing sound. The rumbling intensified.

The lights then went out. It took me about a half a second to register that the power just went out.

I then heard loud crashing sounds coming from outside.

The automatic door was jammed, and I had to force it open. As I stepped outside into the midday sun, I came into a parking lot that was now completely empty. This was when I got the emergency alert on my phone:

UNUSUAL SEISMIC ACTIVITY DETECTED! TAKE SHELTER! EVACUATE IF POSSIBLE!

My heart fell in my chest as I witnessed the two-story building next to ours collapse into the ground, falling into a massive sinkhole. Cement crumbled inward like paper. A cloud of **dust and screams** billowed into the air. And through it – I heard it.

**The writhing, and the wet slapping. The friction of something unnatural squeezing through bedrock, coming from directly below. It had to be massive.**

I didn’t need a second invitation. I quickly made my way out of the plaza and onto the main road. I normally took an hour to get home, but I was determined to reach Rosa, so I decided to move as fast as I could.

I got another buzz on my phone. Another emergency alert? Maybe it was Rosa?! I took it out of my pocket to check for any possible updates. But I was surprised to see who it was.

“Hey! Martin? It’s Claudia. I heard the reports and wanted to know if you were doing alright! Are you still in Los Angeles? Are you alright? Are you safe? Please let me know! I worry so much about you.”

Unbelievable. It was Claudia. Now of all times she decides to reach out to me? After three months of total silence? I sighed deeply, looking down at the text, completely dumbfounded. I regardless ignored it and phoned Rosa.

She picked up—*thank God*—but she was already mid-sentence, voice frantic.

“Martin—it’s a madhouse here. I don’t know what’s happening. People are—”

*“What? Rosa, slow down—”*

“A car just sank outside. *It was just parked*, and the whole street opened like a zipper, and-”

**I then heard a scream from her end of the line.** It was a raw, **soul-ripping sound** that made my blood run cold.

“SOMETHINGS DOWN HERE! IT’S-”

The call cut off. And what followed was an eerie, unsettling silence. I shook my head and made my way onto the tarmac.

Then it burst through the road before me. Chunks of asphalt flew like thrown bricks and debris. And from the earth rose **what I could only describe as a grotesque splice of giant earthworm, tapeworm and leech.** **It was a massive, fleshy, annelid. The best image that comes to mind is that of the sandworms from Dune, the graboids from Tremors and the carnictus from King Kong**

**It was covered in slime and glistening mucus. It was as long as a charter bus. Its maw was lined with spiraling, grinding teeth. It had no eyes, just a large, gaping, open mouth aligned with razor-sharp teeth, wide enough to look like it could swallow a car whole.**

**It was writhing slowly through the air.** It reared up from the street with a screech like tearing metal, flailing about like a baby bird clamoring for food. The creature then **slid back down** into the road, tunneling **just below the next building.** The sidewalk connected to it cracked like glass.

**Then it hit me. There were little to no sinkholes at the foot of the buildings laden on solid cement. I deduced the giant worms couldn’t break through the concrete foundation.** But the **tarmac**?

The **roads**? The **sidewalks**? Or even the tarmac? **They were risky.**

I moved around the building to the side exit, across the narrow strip of cement walkway.  
**Not the road.** At that point, I wasn’t walking anymore, I was running or otherwise jogging towards the apartment, being extra careful to avoid the more brittle and fragile parts of the road.

I was exhausted by the time I finally reached the apartment half an hour later, careful to avoid the roads and tarmac, practically sprinting from building to building.

The door was ajar, and a chill ran down my spine. Knowing what I knew about Rosa, it wasn’t like her leaving the door open like that. It was too quiet. I heard nothing coming from the apartment. No baby cries. I heard no humming either. The light was on but barely. I couldn’t see anything through the closed blinds.

The door creaked faintly as I nudged it open with my foot. Inside, the lights were dim—barely flickering from a loose ceiling fixture, casting everything in sickly yellow hues. Something wasn’t right. Of the handful of times, I’ve been here, it’s never been this eerily quiet. The fact that the door wasn’t even closed furthered my unease.

“Rosa?” I called softly.

“Martin?” Came her voice. But she didn’t sound like her sprightly self.  It was flat. Measured. Like someone reading from a script. **Her tone was off**. No trembling, no relief, no panic. The tone was far too calm considering the circumstances.

I stepped inside cautiously, trying not to make a sound on the creaking laminate floor.

She was kneeling in the living room. Rigid. Shoulders high. Her eyes met mine, wide and glassy, like a trapped animal. Her lips mouthed “you came,” but her eyes were pleading with me not to take another step forward.

That’s when I heard a gun cocking and something cold being pressed to the back of my head.

“Hands up, güero.”

Chapter 1 CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW 001

Three years. One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary.



""Sign here. And here."" Stefan's voice was distant, businesslike. 



He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. ""The highlighted sections need initials.""



My hands wouldn't stop shaking. ""You're doing this today? On our anniversary?""



I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that st\*\*id handmade card on his desk. 



The one I'd spent hours making, like a f\*\*l who still believed in fairy tales. The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. 



Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, writing words I thought mattered.



My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart.



""Camille."" He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before. ""There's no point dragging this out.""



The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger. Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. 



""Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear,"" she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine.



""Is there someone else?""



The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie, Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas. ""Yes.""



One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect.



""How long?""



""Two months."" He wouldn't meet my eyes. ""She came back to town and...""



""Two months,"" I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped ki\*\*ing me goodbye in the mornings.



""Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?""



""I didn't want to hurt you.""



A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. ""That's thoughtful of you.""



My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor. 



Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout I'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit.



""Let me get that..."" Stefan reached for the paper towels.



""Don't."" My voice cracked. ""Just... don't pretend to care now.""



I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee.



The world stopped.



I knew that smile. Those eyes. That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve.



""Rose?"" My sister's name tasted like poison. ""Your first love was Rose?""



Stefan's silence said everything.



Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving to\*\*ts at our engagement party. 



Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy.



My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.



""She never left town, did she?"" The pieces were falling into place. ""She's been here the whole time, waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at st\*\*id, naive Camille.""



""It wasn't like that."" Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture I used to find endearing. ""We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to...""



""If you say 'meant to be' I swear I'll throw this mug at your head."" My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic. ""How long were you together before? Before me?""



He shifted uncomfortably. ""Four years. Until she got the job offer in London.""



Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan. The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him.



""She set this up,"" I whispered. ""All of it. And I fell for every piece.""



""Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you.""



""Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend I was damaged goods? Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?"" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. 



""She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, right?""



Bl\*\*d dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away.



""Don't touch me."" I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. ""Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce? Planning your next wedding?""



""She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better...""



""Better?"" I laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. ""Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people.""



I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose.



""Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly.""



I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady. Let them see I wasn't breaking. Let them think they'd won.



""I'm done talking."" I gathered my purse, the signed papers, Rose's photo. ""Done pretending. Done being the good sister, the perfect wife, the daughter who never complains.""



""Where are you going?""



""Away from you. Away from her. Away from everyone who thinks Camille Lewis is someone they can use and discard.""



My phone buzzed, Rose's smiling face lit up the screen. Right on cue, coming to play her part.



I declined the call and walked to the door. Behind me, Stefan called out, ""You can't just leave. We need to discuss arrangements, the house, the accounts...""



""You can have it all."" I turned to face him one last time. ""The house, the cars, the life you built on lies. I don't want anything that reminds me of either of you.""



""Camille, please...""



""Goodbye, Stefan."" I smiled, and something in my expression made him step back. ""Give Rose my love. Tell her thank you, actually.""



""For what?""



""For finally showing me the truth. About her, about you, about who I need to become.""



I walked out of that house, out of that life, leaving bl\*\*dy fingerprints on the door handle. Let them try to erase those as easily as they'd erased me.



Three years of pretending to be someone I wasn't. Three years of swallowing pain and making excuses for people who never deserved my loyalty.



My phone buzzed again. Rose. Then my mother. Then Stefan. One by one, I blocked them all.



Every connection to the life I thought I had to live.



In my rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Tears streaked my makeup, bl\*\*d stained my dress, my hair had come loose from its perfect twist.



I looked nothing like the polished, proper wife Stefan Rodriguez had married.





Chapter 2 CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW 002

The house was quiet, too quiet. I slipped in through the side door, locking it softly behind me. 



The air smelled like lemon polish and roses, just like it always did. It felt strange to be back, like stepping into someone else's life.



The kitchen was dark except for the faint glow of the fridge light. I crept up the stairs, careful to skip the third step that creaked. Every sound I made felt loud, like the house itself was listening.



When I reached my bedroom door, I stopped. It was open a crack, just like I'd left it all those years ago. Taking a deep breath, I stepped inside and shut the door.



My childhood bedroom hadn't changed in three years. Same pale pink walls, same white furniture, same collection of second-place trophies. Rose's first-place ones used to shine in the room next door.



I stared at my reflection in the vanity mirror, the same one where I'd practiced my wedding makeup three years ago, Rose standing behind me with that perfect smile. 



Now my mascara was smeared, hair wild, designer dress wrinkled. Mom would have a fit if she saw me like this.



The clock on my nightstand read 10:47 PM. I'd been sitting here for hours, packing what little of my old life I wanted to keep. Amazing how seventeen years in this house fit into one duffel bag.



My phone buzzed again, the twentieth time in an hour. This time it was Mom.



""Camille, this is ridiculous. Come home so we can discuss this like adults. Rose is worried sick...""



I hung up. Of course Rose was worried. Her carefully laid plans were unraveling.



The front door clicked open downstairs. I froze, listening to familiar footsteps on hardwood. The slight tap of heels, the whisper of expensive fabric.



""Camille?"" Mom's voice floated up the stairs. ""Darling, I know you're here. The housekeeper saw your car.""



I should have parked around the block. Should have been smarter, faster, better at disappearing. But I'd never been the clever one, had I? That was Rose's role.



More footsteps. A deeper voice, Dad, probably called home from work to deal with his hysterical younger daughter. Again.



""Princess?"" His voice carried that same gentle tone he'd used when I was twelve, crying about Rose getting my spot in the school play. ""Let's talk about this.""



A third set of footsteps made my bl\*\*d freeze. Lighter, more graceful. Perfect, like everything else about her.



""Camille?"" Rose's voice dripped concern. ""Sweetie, please. Don't shut us out.""



I looked at the family photo on my dresser, taken the day Rose's adoption was finalized. 



Mom and Dad beaming, Rose radiant in her new dress, thirteen-year-old me trying to smile through braces and acne. One big happy family.



What a joke.



The memory hit me like a punch to the gut:



\---



""But I've been practicing for months!"" I clutched my script, tears blurring the words. ""Mrs. Bennett said the lead was mine!""



Rose touched my shoulder, gentle as always. ""Oh, sweetie. I didn't mean to take your part. I just... the words came so naturally in the audition. Mrs. Bennett said I had a gift.""



Of course she did. Everyone said Rose had a gift. For music, for acting, for making people love her.



""Maybe..."" Rose's eyes lit up with that special gleam that always meant trouble. ""Maybe you could help me practice? Be my supporting actress? We could make it our sister thing!



I'd agreed. Because that's what good sisters did. Because saying no to Rose meant disappointed looks from Mom, lectures from Dad about family loyalty.



Opening night, I watched from the wings as Rose brought the audience to tears. Afterward, Mom bought her roses. Dad took us all to dinner.



No one mentioned that I'd written Rose's best lines during our ""practice sessions."" Or that her dramatic monologue had been word-for-word what I'd performed in my original audition.



Rose just had a gift for memorization, that's all.



\---



""Camille Elizabeth Lewis!"" Mom's voice sharpened. ""This behavior is completely unacceptable.""



I opened my bedroom door.



They stood in the hallway like a perfect family portrait, Mom in her designer suit, Dad looking distinguished in his work clothes, Rose wearing concern like the latest fashion trend.



""Hello, sister."" My voice came out steady. ""Shouldn't you be comforting your fiancé?""



Rose's eyes widened. Always the performer. ""Camille, please. Let me explain...""



""Explain what? How you've been sl\*\*ping with my husband? Or how you set this whole thing up from the beginning?""



""What is she talking about?"" Dad turned to Rose, who already had tears forming. Perfect, delicate tears that never smeared her makeup.



""She's upset,"" Rose whispered. ""Lashing out. You know how she gets, Daddy.""



""Don't."" My laugh sounded strange, even to me. 



""Don't you dare play that card again. Show them the ring, Rose. The one Stefan gave you two months ago while I was supposedly too sick to attend the charity gala.""



Mom gasped. Dad's face darkened. But Rose, Rose's mask slipped for just a second. I saw it this time, that flash of cold calculation behind the concern.



""It wasn't like that,"" she started.



""Really? Then how was it? Explain to everyone how you've been calling me every week, giving me marriage advice while sl\*\*ping with my husband. Tell them about all the times you helped me pick out li\*\*erie for anniversaries when Stefan was really working late with you.""



""That's enough!"" Mom stepped forward. ""Rose would never...""



""Never what, Mom? Never lie? Never manipulate? Never steal something that belonged to her sister?"" I pulled out my phone, playing the last voicemail from Stefan.



His voice filled the hallway: ""Rose is my soulmate, Camille. We tried to fight it, but some people are just meant to be together. You have to understand...""



The silence that followed was deafening.



Rose recovered first. ""I never meant to hurt you. We can't help who we love...""



The sound of my palm connecting with her cheek echoed like a g\*\*shot.



""Camille!"" Mom grabbed my arm. ""Have you lost your mind?""



""No,"" I said quietly, watching a red mark bloom on Rose's perfect face. ""For the first time in fourteen years, I'm seeing clearly.""



I walked past them, duffel bag in hand. Behind me, Rose's sobs started, the same performance she'd perfected over years of turning everyone against me.



""Where are you going?"" Dad called after me. ""You can't just walk away from family!""



I paused at the top of the stairs, looking back at my so-called family. Mom comforting Rose, Dad looking torn, and my sister watching me through her tears with eyes that held no warmth at all.



""Family?"" I smiled, and something in my expression made them all step back. ""No, this isn't family. This is a game. And for fourteen years, I've been playing by Rose's rules.""



""Camille, please,"" Rose reached for me, ever the caring sister. ""Let me make this right.""



I caught her wrist before she could touch me. ""You taught me well, big sister. About manipulation. About patience. About waiting for the perfect moment to strike.""



Her eyes widened, real fear this time, not performed.



""Thank you for the lessons,"" I whispered, letting her go. ""Now watch how well I learned them.""



I walked down the stairs, ignoring their calls. In the foyer mirror, I caught one last glimpse of myself, mascara-stained, wild-eyed, finally unchained.





Chapter 3 ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW 003

I swirled the ch\*\*pagne in my crystal flute, watching the bubbles dance. Victory tasted sweet, just like I'd imagined all these years.



The living room of my penthouse apartment overlooked the city where I'd spent twenty years pretending to be the perfect adopted daughter, the loving sister, the supportive friend.



What a joke.



""To freedom,"" I whispered to my reflection in the window. The woman staring back at me smiled, perfect teeth, perfect hair, perfect lies. Just like always.



My phone buzzed again. Another missed call from Stefan. He'd been calling non-stop since Camille walked out, probably worried I'd change my mind now that everything was in the open. 



Poor, predictable Stefan. Still thinking he was in control of any of this.



I kicked off my Louboutins and sank into the leather couch, letting memories wash over me like warm w\*\*e.



\---



The first time I saw Camille Lewis, I hated her.



I was thirteen, fresh out of foster care, desperate to please my new parents. 



They'd brought me to this massive house with its manicured lawn and marble floors, promising me a fresh start. A real family.



Then this skinny thing with braces and messy hair came bouncing down the stairs, all eager smiles and innocent eyes.



""Hi! I'm Camille. I've always wanted a sister!""



She hugged me right there in the foyer, not caring that my clothes were secondhand or that I smelled like the group home's industrial detergent. Just pure, genuine joy at having a sister.



I wanted to vomit.



Because there she was, this awkward, imperfect girl who had everything I'd spent thirteen years dreaming about. 



Parents who actually wanted her. A home she belonged in. A future secured by the Lewis family name.



And she didn't even appreciate it properly.



I watched her over dinner that first night, watched how she slouched in her chair and talked with her mouth full. How she didn't know which fork to use for salad.



How she laughed too loud and asked too many questions.



""Rose has such lovely manners,"" Mrs. Lewis... Mom... had said, smiling at me. ""Perhaps you could learn from your new sister, Camille.""



That's when I saw it. The first crack in Camille's perfect world. The slight dimming of her smile, the way she sat up straighter, tried harder.



It was beautiful.



\---



My phone buzzed again, pulling me back to the present. Stefan's face lit up my screen, his fifth call in an hour. With a sigh, I answered.



""Darling, you're being needy.""



""Rose."" His voice was rough. Had he been drinking? ""She's gone. Really gone. Blocked my number, cleaned out her closet...""



""Isn't that what we wanted?"" I kept my voice gentle, soothing. The same tone I'd used all those times I'd counseled Camille through her marital problems. Problems I'd carefully orchestrated.""



""I just... the way she looked at me...""



""Stefan, sweetheart."" I let steel edge into my sweetness. ""Are you having second thoughts? After everything we've been through?""



""No! No, of course not. I love you. I've always loved you.""



""Then stop calling me about your ex-wife. It's pathetic.""



I hung up, tossing the phone aside. Men were so predictably weak.



Even Stefan, who I'd spent four years grooming before pushing him toward Camille, still needed constant management.



But he'd served his purpose. Just like everyone else in my carefully constructed game.



The family photo on my mantel caught my eye, my adoption day. I stood in the center, of course. Always the center. 



Camille pushed to the edge of the frame, trying so hard to smile through her insecurities.



God, it had been easy. Almost too easy.



A little whisper here about how Camille was unstable. A few concerned conversations with Mom about how worried I was about my dear sister's emotional state. 



Casual mentions to Dad about how Camille seemed to be struggling with basic adult responsibilities.



Fourteen years of careful groundwork, positioning myself as the responsible daughter, the achievable dream, while slowly crushing Camille's confidence, her relationships, her sense of self.



The college rejection was particularly inspired, if I do say so myself. All it took was one tearful conversation with Mom about finding Camille's ""secret"" diary, filled with dark thoughts and destructive plans. 



Plans I'd written myself, of course, in Camille's childish handwriting that I'd spent months practicing to forge.



Suddenly, their precious younger daughter wasn't ready for college. Needed time to ""find herself."" Needed to stay close to home where they could watch her.



Where I could watch her.



I took another sip of ch\*\*pagne, savoring the moment. Because this, this was what I'd really wanted all along. 



Not Stefan, he was just a useful pawn. Not the Lewis fortune, though that would come in time.



No, what I wanted was to watch perfect, precious Camille finally break. To see her realize that everything she thought she had family, love, security, had been built on my lies.



My phone buzzed with a text from Mom: ""Rose, darling, please come over. Your father and I need to talk about what happened.""



I smiled, already planning my performance. The tearful confusion, the reluctant confession about Stefan's pursuit, the gentle concern about Camille's mental state.



By the time I was done, they'd be thanking me for protecting them from their unstable daughter all these years.



Standing up, I walked to my closet, selecting the perfect outfit for my next scene. Something subtle but expensive. Grieving sister, not celebrating victor.



The massive walk-in closet had been Camille's wedding gift to me. ""So you'll always have space for your amazing fashion sense,"" she'd said, hugging me tight.



Even then, even after years of watching me steal every spotlight, every opportunity, every scrap of parental approval, she'd still loved me. Still trusted me.



Id\*\*t.



I pulled out a cream cashmere sweater, remembering how Camille used to borrow my clothes in high school. 



How I'd wait until she had something important, a date, a presentation, an interview, then suddenly remember I needed that exact outfit.



She'd always given them back without argument. Always apologized for the inconvenience.



Always tried so hard to be the perfect sister.



My reflection caught my eye, and for a moment, just a moment, I saw something ugly there. 



Something that looked like the scared, angry foster kid who'd walked into the Lewis house all those years ago.



But then I blinked, and I was perfect Rose again. Flawless Rose. Rose who could do no wrong.



Slipping on my Cartier bracelet, another gift from my dear sister, I prepared for my next performance. 



The concerned family meeting would need just the right touch of reluctant honesty, devastated betrayal.



""Oh, Camille,"" I whispered to my reflection, practicing my worried frown. ""What have you done to yourself?""



But as I turned to leave, something made me pause. That look in Camille's eyes before she'd walked out, I'd never seen it before. 



Not in twenty years of pushing her, testing her, breaking her.



It had looked almost like... understanding.



Like she'd finally seen through my mask to the truth underneath.



I shook off the uneasy feeling. Camille was weak, just like I'd made her. She'd run away, lick her wounds, maybe try to start over somewhere new.



But she'd never be free of me. I'd made sure of that years ago.





Chapter 4 STEFAN'S POINT OF VIEW 004

The sc\*\*ch burned going down, but I poured another anyway. 



My third? Fourth? I'd lost count somewhere between signing those divorce papers and watching Camille walk away.



Our wedding photo still sat on my desk, mocking me. Camille's genuine smile, my distracted eyes,  already looking past her, always looking for Rose.



Rose.



Even her name felt like betrayal now.



My phone lit up with another message from her: ""Darling, stop drinking and come over. We should celebrate.""



Celebrate. Like we hadn't just destroyed someone who loved us. Someone who'd given me three years of devotion I never deserved.



The memory hit me like a punch to the gut.



\---



""Stefan?"" Camille's voice was small, uncertain. ""Did I do something wrong?""



I looked up from my laptop, irritated at the interruption. She stood in the doorway of my home office, holding a plate of something that smelled amazing.

1nnatel,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nnatel/i_just_terminated_a_relationship_via_whatsapp/,I just terminated a relationship via Whatsapp message,"AITA? I was dating this girl for a few months, went exclusive a couple months back.

The problem here is we each have some grievances against each other:

On her side, she felt like I wasn't a very caring person. First up, I didn't greet her in the morning via whatsapp, which she mentioned to me, after which I did greet her, but only said good morning and nothing else, which she felt was rather uncaring too. In truth in the morning before my coffee kicks in I really don't feel like chatting with anyone, but for her sake I did it.

Another issue is that she felt I was a very poor talker; few examples:

1. She was asking me about liking other girls' insta posts / stories, and how come I didn't like hers, to which I said well if you had new ones of course I'd like or comment on them, but going back to like all your old ones is kinda stalker-ish right? She wasn't too happy on that - felt like I should have said more sweet stuff to her.

2. She took a double dose of medicine at night and told me, I just said to take care and hope she felt better in the morning. She felt I should have told her to be more careful next time etc etc etc

3. Final straw - she told me she had some insta stories so I checked it out and told her she did some beautiful effects on the last story. She went ""how about the other stories"" and I went ""well this is the nicest one"". She was like okok you win and I send a tongue out emoji, upon which she lost it.

Basically she feels I'm an uncaring person and she's doing all the emotional labor in the relationship.

On my end I feel like I did take care of her, apart from driving over to fetch her when we go out and covering the bills, I also send food when she hasn't got enough to eat at home and fruit for her (she earns less and has to support parents). My primary complaint is that she only makes time for me a couple times a month, her reason being that she is tired from work and only comes out on Saturdays, so if she meets friends then we can't meet that week. 

I also don't like to be constantly dumped on for being a poor sweet-talker. As per her own admission she was actually looking for something to pick on me so that I would say stuff to comfort her and make her happy.

Also basically after we got together, she kinda felt like I pushed her into the relationship because I asked once and then a month later, she said alright as she liked me but she would really have preferred that I wait longer (6 months or more dated from us getting to know each other). This made her feel some pressure (her words). Imo she could have said no, I would just have re-evaluated the whole thing then.

Recently I went for a work trip for a week and a couple days in she started sounding cold via text. So I asked her if anything was wrong and she said we would discuss when I got back. I got back and asked her on Sunday, she said she wanted to talk face to face. I said I've been waiting a long time and I'm stressed out, please tell me now what this is all about. She refused and saying I was being pushy again, and said we could discuss on the next Saturday. By this time I was sick of everything and just messaged her that I don't think we are a good fit, I think she treats me poorly and let's call an end to it. Then I went to sleep.

I do know that breaking up via Whatsapp isn't the standard for dating etiquette, but I was very fed up about having to sit around another week to find out what she was angry about again. So AITA?

It started like any other day.

I work a typical 9 to 5 in a gray-walled office wedged between a refinery and a cold storage depot. It was nothing glamorous. Just payroll, inventory, and data entry. The warehouse out back hums with forklifts and pallets and smells like oil, steel, and stale coffee. It’s industrial purgatory. My job is to make sure the numbers line up and nobody’s skimming off the top.

I usually clock out around dusk, when the sodium lights flicker on and the sky turns bruised and yellow. That night, I lingered a little longer—triple-checking a shipment invoice that didn’t sit right. A truckload of supplies had gone unlogged. No signature, no weight data, no product line. Just a blank space where there should have been something. Or someone.

From my second-floor office window, I had a clear view of the backloading dock.

That’s when I saw the truck.

A large, white freight hauler—unmarked, the kind that smells like bleach and cold sweat—backed into the far bay with its lights off. It rolled in slow, deliberate, like it didn’t want to be seen. A man in a reflective vest emerged from the cab, then opened the rear doors.

And then… they stepped out one by one.

Four women. At first glance, they looked like human girls, but they had unusual features. I couldn’t quite make them out as they each wore oversized coats they pulled tight around their bodies, as if they were trying to disappear into the fabric. Their eyes were wide searching the shadows, like prey searching for their predators. One stumbled slightly as she hit the concrete, catching herself with trembling fingers.

I should’ve called someone.

But something stopped me. Something about their faces.

They were beautiful. Almost too beautiful. The kind of beauty that feels more *designed* than born. I squinted against the glass, trying to parse what I was seeing.

For example, one woman’s skin had a faint reddish hue, not from blush or windburn, but something deeper. She had undertones that shimmered when the light caught her cheek just right. Small, curling horns poked through the top of her head, as her dark black hair was cropped short just below her neck.

They looked too connected to her forehead to be prosthetic.

I told myself they were costumes. Makeup. Some kind of elaborate viral stunt. A haunted house promo maybe, or one of those weird immersive theater things rich people pay thousands for.

But what kind of show leaves its actors looking like they’re terrified out of their minds? What kind of role demands fear that raw?

One of the girls looked right at me.

I caught the longing in her eyes, the fear, and the desperation. And in that moment, I knew she wasn’t playing a part.

None of them were.

A few men emerged from the yawning darkness of the warehouse. Their movements were slow, casual, like this was routine. No shouting, no barking of orders. Just calm, practiced movements. They didn’t have uniforms, but they wore dark jackets and work gloves. One of them held a clipboard, as if this was just another delivery to log.

The girls hesitated at the edge of the truck’s shadow, but a sharp gesture from one of the men sent them filing inside in a single, obedient line. No protest. No resistance. Just the slow, hollow shuffle of sandaled feet on concrete as they filed one by one single file into the warehouse.

Something about their silence made the hair rise on my arms.

Without thinking, I grabbed my keys and left the building. My heart jackhammered in my chest as I went to the back of the building, out of sight, where my vehicle was parked. I slid into my car and pulled away from my usual spot, circling around the far end of the lot, just past a rusted chain-link fence, where many unused vehicles remained in an unpaved lot. I tucked in beside a few of them, out of view, and killed the engine.

From there, I had a clear line of sight to the warehouse’s open bay.

The men were stripping the girls.

They peeled away the oversized coats like they were shedding packaging. The garments hit the floor in limp piles, revealing the girls' barely clothed bodies. Just jean shorts and bikini tops were covering them. The warehouse lights glared down on their skin, sterile and unflinching.

Each girl stood stiff as a statue. Eyes shut tight, arms locked at their sides like it might protect them, or maybe because they’d been told not to move. Their bodies trembled slightly in the chill, but they didn’t make a sound.

And then I saw them.

Really saw them.

The green-skinned girl was the first to break my sense of disbelief. Her hair was writhing, coiling. At first, I thought it was some kind of clever prop, but my blood chilled when I now got a better look. Each strand of her hair was alive, wriggling independently like it had its own mind.

Snakes! Her hair was made of snakes!

They hissed and coiled, agitated, though she stood perfectly still. Her skin wasn’t painted. It was smooth, lime-colored, patterned faintly with scales that shimmered under the fluorescent lights. Her pupils were vertical slits, and I swear—when she opened her eyes for a flicker of a second—she looked directly at me.

The red-skinned girl beside her was slightly taller, her horns curling back over her head like ram's horns, polished and dark. Her skin was a muted crimson, not firetruck red but more like old blood. There was something subtly wrong with the air around her, like heat shimmered off her body even though it was cold. Her expression was blank, distant, but her lips parted slightly, showing two elongated canines.

She had to be a succubus.

The aquatic girl, blue as sea glass, stood next to her. Her skin had a faint iridescence, and her collarbones bore subtle ridges where her gills fluttered, as if testing the air. Her eyes were wide and silver-flecked, and her feet, fully webbed, shifted on the concrete like she didn’t know how to stand upright for long. She had long, elaborate dark blue hair that cascaded down her back. She looked... newer. Less hardened. Her arms were mostly human, but around her elbows the scales thickened, hinting at something underneath that didn’t belong on land.

She looked a lot like a mermaid, only with legs.

And then there was the third woman, the fairy.

God, she looked fragile. And she was so small. She had to be no taller than five feet. The kind of thin that suggested she hadn’t eaten in weeks. Her skin was a cold shade of ivory with almost runic veins etched all over her body in elaborate patterns. Her mouth was clamped shut, but when she turned slightly, I caught a glimpse of her wings. They were long, slender, not the cartoonish kind, but real, elaborate and elegant. Her normally happy expression was absent, replaced by a cold, gaunt look.

One of the men walked up behind them and began fastening black zip ties around their wrists; tight, unforgiving. He moved mechanically, as though binding exotic animals for transport. He looped their ankles with chains, thin enough to walk in, thick enough to control. The girls flinched at the contact but said nothing. The succubus winced as the plastic bit into her wrists. The mermaid’s eyes welled slightly, but the tears didn’t fall.

Then the man did something that made my blood run cold.

He slapped the gorgon across the ass, hard. The sound echoed through the empty lot like a gunshot. She didn’t react. She didn’t cry out or turn her head. But I saw the snakes recoil violently, hissing, writhing with fury she couldn’t show.

The men herded them deeper into the warehouse like livestock.

I just sat there, trying to process what the fark I was seeing.

Because in that moment, one horrifying thought lodged deep in my skull:

These girls weren’t just being trafficked.

They weren’t even human.

My fingers were frozen on the steering wheel, heart pounding so hard it made my vision pulse. My brain was screaming at me to call someone. Anyone! But who the hell would believe me? Hey, officer, I just watched four mythological monster girls get taken into a warehouse at the center of the city.

Yeah, because 911 wouldn’t tell me not to tie up the line.

As they were led further inside, the light grew dimmer. The warehouse swallowed them, but not entirely. A single floodlight buzzed overhead, casting a broad yellow cone over a low, makeshift couch positioned just beyond the bay entrance—cobbled together from old cushions and tarp-covered padding. It looked like something torn from a brothel or holding cell. Stained. Improvised. *Used*.

The girls were sat there in a silent row, facing the lot. Facing *me*.

I sank lower in my seat, heart pounding again. From the shadows of the junked patrol cars, wedged between a rusted pickup and a hollowed-out school bus, I prayed they couldn’t see me.

But something told me they could.

The men who brought them in moved to the back of the warehouse. One flipped a switch. The bay doors began to roll shut with a slow metallic groan, but they stopped just shy of closing completely. Maybe five or six feet off the ground. Enough to let in air. Or maybe to let something else out.

Then they left the girls alone.

And in the silence that followed, the girls sat motionless—like artifacts on display, too exhausted to cry and too hopeless to run. Their heads drooped, and their limbs, still bound, trembled subtly. Some stared at nothing. Others scanned the warehouse’s rusted walls with the expression of someone already dreaming of escape.

Then, all at once, their eyes locked with mine.

It was almost imperceptible. No sudden movement. No gasp. Just a shift subtle, mechanical, instinctive—as their eyes aligned with mine. As if they’d known I was there. It wase the whole time. As if they’d been *waiting*.

Their gazes didn’t move from me. They didn’t dare turn their heads, didn’t twitch or gesture or alert their handlers. They stayed perfectly still, communicating only through their eyes. A look passed between them, brief, but barely perceptible. Then back to me.

And what I saw in their expressions wasn’t malice or hunger.

It was *grief*. Unfiltered, soul-flattening *grief*. The kind you don’t fake.

The gorgon girl sat with her knees pressed tightly together, her wrists zip-tied behind her back, shoulders curled forward like she was trying to hide her form. Her snakes no longer moved—they hung limp, defeated, as if they, too, had been broken. Her green skin was mottled now, blotched along her arms and thighs, and there were bruises and deep purple welts just below her bikini line. Her eyes locked on mine. And behind them, desperation.

The succubus looked older. Not by years, but by mileage. Her light red skin shimmered faintly under the light, not glittery but *raw*, like an open wound healing over. Her horns curved back like polished obsidian, beautiful but scarred—one chipped at the base, like it had been cracked with a blunt instrument. Her chest was bound by a fraying bikini top that looked too tight, clearly not designed for comfort. Her lips moved slightly, whispering something I couldn’t hear.

The mermaid girl sat with her legs drawn up, feet tucked beneath her. Her blue-scaled skin looked drier than before, as though the air was hurting her. The edges of her gills twitched, struggling to take in oxygen, and her chest rose and fell rapidly. Her bikini top was damp in places, stained with something that didn’t look like water. There were red rings around her wrists, deeper than the others, like she'd struggled the most. Her silver eyes welled with tears that never fell.

And the fairy girl…

She sat straight-backed, as if posture was all she had left. Her legs were crossed at the ankles, but the chain dug into her skin, leaving little bloody half-moons. Her skin was paler than the others, almost translucent now, the veins beneath glowing faintly blue in the dark. Her eyes, glimmering like diamonds, glinted as they found mine. She looked at me the longest.

It wasn’t hunger. It was *recognition*. Like she knew who I was. Or had known someone like me once. And still, I didn’t move. A part of me *wanted* to. To leap from the car and scream at the men, alert law enforcement, rush in there with a tire iron like some kind of bargain-bin savior. But another part, deeper, colder, hesitated.

Because I *knew* things. I’d read the stories. The reports. The conspiracy threads.

Succubi don’t need consent. They drain you while you sleep. Medusas turn men to stone—sometimes only from the waist down. And mermaids? The old kind, the *real* kind? Much of mythology says they pulled sailors into the deep just to watch them drown. And lastly, not all fairies were benevolent.

These women could have lured dozens to their deaths. Maybe more. Could I really afford to take my chances? But if that was true, if these weren’t victims but predators..

Then who were *those men*?

I glanced back at the warehouse. No insignias. No badges. No containment gear. Just gloves and zip ties. Who do they work for anyway?

If they were from the SCP Foundation, or the Global Occult Coalition, or whatever black-budget monster-hunting agency the internet whispered about, why were they *here* of all places? Why a rotting warehouse off I-95 in the industrial epicenter of North Miami? Why not a deep-sea lab or some forest bunker where no one could see? It didn’t make sense. But it was more reason to believe that this wasn’t containment. It was commerce.

And I had a suspicion as to precisely what kind.

My hands moved before my conscience could catch up. I pulled out my phone, my heart was still pounding, and didn’t even bother opening Google. This wasn’t something I’d find on Yelp.

So, I downloaded Tor. Because whatever those girls were, they weren’t the only ones being sold. And I guarantee you I wouldn’t have found them anywhere else.

Within minutes, I was browsing the dark web and it wasn’t long before I discovered the classifieds. I wont go into detail of what else I came across, just know I found what I was looking for.

It surprisingly did not take too long. Within minutes I was browsing escorts on an exclusive dark web form. And I found women of various ‘exotic’ subspecies on a website not normally accessible on google. They had fairies, pixies, succubae, harpies, and even the bird-like sirens all available for ‘rent’ on their site. They have clients of all kinds, ranging from human to non-human.

Confirmed.

My only question was, if they were being trafficked from other dimensions or worlds, then it would stand to reason that some kind of government agency would be watching stuff like this. Getting curious, I decided to look up the instructions needed to ‘book’ a session.

But before I could type a single letter, something happened.

A low mechanical whine filled the air outside my vehicle, coming from across the lot. I looked up from the phone to turn my gaze immediately upon the warehouse. I saw the door yawning open. Thick shadows peeled away as halogen lights spilled out from within. And there they were.

The girls. All four of them. Led out in single file, like livestock.

The two men from before—heavyset, pale-skinned, wearing nondescript utility jackets—ushered them forward with quick, mechanical hand gestures. I could hear faint commands muffled through the air: “Keep your eyes down.” “Move.” “No noise.”

They didn’t need to threaten. The girls were already broken in.

Each of them was bound now. Not just zip ties around their wrists like before, but full restraints—ankles shackled together with thick, black iron cuffs, arms trussed behind their backs with heavy leather belts. And this time… each one had a **ball gag** strapped into their mouths, tightly enough that their cheeks bulged and their breathing rasped through their nostrils.

Their outfits—if you could even call them that—were degraded even further. Small bikini tops stretched taut across their chests, barely covering anything. Short shorts clung to their hips like afterthoughts, riding high between their thighs. They weren’t costumes anymore. They were *uniforms*. Assigned. Dehumanizing.

The **gorgon woman** walked at the front. Her green skin shimmered slightly under the fluorescent light, and her snake-hair writhed weakly, like it had been sedated. Her eyes scanned the area as she walked, darting left and right in brief jerks. She looked for an escape route, maybe. I watched her gaze pass over the lot. And then, it hit my car. Her pupils sharpened. Locked. Our eyes met.

Behind her, the **succubus** shuffled forward, her crimson skin marked with bruises along her ribs. Her horns had been shaved down since I last saw her. Roughly. Unevenly. A punishment, maybe. Her tail twitched behind her like it was trying to hide.

The **mermaid girl** walked in stiff, halting steps, her webbed toes curled in shame. Her gills flared weakly with each shallow breath, irritated from the dry air. She winced with every step, like the asphalt burned her feet.

The fairy, or nymph-like girl was the last to be loaded. She was tiny—no taller than 4’11, but the way she moved, the way her body trembled with each step, she looked even smaller. Fragile. Breakable. Her translucent wings had been cruelly pinned—folded tight against her back beneath a leather harness that pressed down hard, the wing joints visibly strained and twitching under the weight. Every few seconds, they fluttered instinctively, as if trying to open, only to be jerked back down by the restraint.

They were loaded into a large white truck again—same model as before, only now without the subtlety. The rear doors were wide open, revealing a padded interior with low red lights, a bench lining either side, and steel rings bolted to the walls—anchor points

One by one, the girls were pushed up the small ramp and chained inside. The doors slammed shut with the finality of a tomb.

I made a decision.

I threw my phone into the passenger seat and turned the key in the ignition. I didn’t care about the form anymore. I needed to *know* where they were going. I pulled out slowly, keeping three car lengths behind the truck as it rolled out of the warehouse lot and onto the main road. I killed my headlights.

The city was quiet at this hour, nothing but low neon glows and the occasional flicker of a crosswalk sign. The truck didn’t move fast. Like it had no fear of being followed.

It took me less than ten minutes to realize where they were going.

**The Strip is just outside the Miami International Airport.**

A ring of sleazy motels, gas stations, hourly-rate rooms, and concrete towers baking under yellow-orange streetlamps. I passed a billboard advertising “Fantasy Island Spa” and another offering discounted “companionship services.” Every building seemed to lean sideways with mildew and regret.

The truck pulled into the back lot of a one-story motel that didn’t even bother hiding its purpose. No signs. No lights. Just faded brick and boarded-up windows. The kind of place where you checked in through a thick glass slot and never asked for towels.

I parked again, this time behind a shuttered laundromat across the street. I watched the men open the back doors to the truck.

First came the **gorgon woman** again. Still at the front. Her feet dragged as they pulled her out by the arm. She tried to resist, but her shackled legs gave her no leverage. One of the men *shoved* her forward, and she fell hard onto the gravel, the gag making a wet, choking thud against her lips. She whimpered. A sound I could barely hear but *felt* in my teeth.

The snakes on her head twitched frantically, like they were trying to fight back. Two men got out of the vehicle and hoisted her up. She walked gingerly on two feet barely covered with sandals, the two men guiding her up the paved sidewalk.

The motel itself met every definition of ‘seedy’ you could think of. It was only one story, and the building itself couldn’t have had more than a dozen rooms carved into it. The overhead sign was gone, and the neon-lit vacancy light was only half lit. A single row of doors lit by flickering amber bulbs that hummed with bugs

The faded green paint peeling like sunburned skin and security bars warped from age or misuse. The overhead sign was gone, torn off or collapsed long ago. Only a skeletal frame remained, rusted through and straining against the wind. Beneath it, a busted neon *VACANCY* light glowed half-lit and stuttering, casting the letters *V-A-C-C-Y* across the parking lot like a joke no one was in on. The place looked like it was functional, but barely.

I saw them take the gorgon woman to one of the doors, I faintly made out the number 12 just above as the door opened and she was escorted inside. I looked back down at my phone, and reopened the Tor browser. My eyes went to the unnamed website where I found the escort services. I adjusted my location accordingly to Miami.

I waited a few minutes.

And then, I found her. It was the gorgon woman. I texted the number below. I waited a few more minutes before I got a response. The reply came in a green text bubble. Simple. Too simple.

**Room 12. Come alone. 100 per hour. Cash only.**

That was it. There was no name or greeting. Just a blunt set of instructions. It felt less like an invitation and more of a transaction.

I stared at the message for a while. My thumb hovered over the screen. A part of me kept waiting for a second reply. Or a clarification. Or maybe even a joke, but that was wishful thinking at this point. I wanted a reason not to go in there, and there were too many to list. I wanted to believe that the gorgon lady wanted to eat me, or turn me into stone. But I just couldn’t.

I glanced back across the street.

Room 12 was dark again, the window light had been clicked off. The only thing marking it from the other rooms was the faint, uneven scrawl of the number above the door, its paint chipping off.

The parking lot was still empty. No cars, pedestrians or other signs of life, except for a single curtain twitching in one of the rooms further down the row. I didn’t like that. Someone was watching. Or something was. I sat back in the seat and tried to breathe, but my lungs were tight.

This wasn’t curiosity anymore. Not really. It was something colder, heavier. Like I’d seen too much already, and now I wasn’t *allowed* to look away. No. I *couldn’t* look away.

I stared at the message again.

**Room 12. Come alone. 100 per hour. Cash only.**

I took a deep breath and exited my vehicle, making my way across the street and to the motel. I walked up to door number 12. I knocked twice. I technically was a brown belt in BJJ and had light striking skills with taekwondo, so in that department I had some kind of plan should someone want to get physical with me.

After a few minutes, the door slowly opened, and the gorgon woman looked up at me. I saw that she was covered in a silky smooth, see-through bathrobe. She tucked a few snakes behind her ear as she let off a meek, yet nervous smile.

“Please come in.”

I nodded as she took my hand and guided me into the room. Her hand was cold.

Her 5’2 frame he gently guided my 5’10 self to the bed. The snakes coiled behind her ear twitched once more as if whispering something I wasn’t meant to hear.

The door shut behind me with a soft click that sounded louder than it should have in the silence. The room was dimly lit, only by a bedside lamp with a cracked shade. The air was thick with a strange mix of scents: cheap rosewater, stale sweat, and perfume that had a rosy, yet pungent odor. It was inviting, yet it stung my nostrils.

There was no music, or TV. Only the sounds of her and my breathing filled the room.

She gently sat me down on the bed an stood over me. She then very slowly undid the sash, dropping it to the floor, letting the robe fall open. She was wearing a tight-fitting thong and a bra. It wasn’t long before I noticed the cuts, bruises and welts along her body. Her eyes were heavy.

“Are you okay?”

She forced a smile and nodded, then straddling me on the bed. She begun to ravish my neck, purring like a kitten.

“So strong. So handsome.” She giggled.

“I don’t want to have sex.”

She then looked at me like I killed ten people. I then picked her up and gently laid her on the bed. She sat up to look at me as I sat down next to her.

“Can we… talk?”

She tilted her head. “Talk?”

I nodded.

Her eyes went wide as she pressed her fingers to her temple. “T-talk? You w-want to-you want to talk?”

I nodded. “To get to know you better.”

Her eyes widened as she just stared at me like I was the president of the United States.

“Nobody has …I don’t….” she stammered, and then shook her head. “Im not allowed to answer questions.”

I then heard a pounding on the door.

“Alina! You better not be telling anyone anything about us!” she heard someone scream.

“Oh no. He sounds drunk.” She raved, and then turned to me. “You need to-”

The door slammed open and a tall man about my height came out.

“You! Outside! Me and the lady need to have a little talk.”

I glanced at the gorgon woman. Now the fresh tears were streaming down her face as she clutched the blanket from the bed to her chest.

I got up from the bed, frozen and I just stared at the man, my stupid neurodivergence not knowing what to do.

“Are you deaf?! Leave now!” he then stormed over to me.

His breath hit my face, sour and hot, as he grabbed a fistful of my collar. My brain lagged for a split second, choking on the sudden pressure, the shouting, the chaos.

And then everything snapped into place. I didn’t think—I *reacted*. I went for a straight body lock, my hips turning, and I drove him backwards off his balance, tackling him hard onto the dirty motel floor with a hollow *THUMP* that shook the lampshade.

The moment he went to the ground, I immediately got into position wrapping my legs around one of his. He tried to scramble, but I was already repositioning.

I grabbed his leg, controlled the heel, dropped my weight sideways, and twisted. Fast. Brutal. A perfect heel hook. There was a pop. Then a scream. High-pitched, animal, involuntary.

He flailed, slamming his fists on the floor, howling in raw, guttural pain as his knee exploded under the torque. I moved over to his head and executed an anaconda choke around his neck. He was out cold in seconds.

I stood, chest heaving.

The gorgon woman was still on the bed, shaking, her snakes hissing low and defensive around her face like a living halo. But she was staring at me differently now, with widened eyes filled with awe and admiration.

“You-” she stuttered. “-You fought for me.”

I shrugged. “I guess I did what anyone would do.”

She let off a slight smirk, looking up at me like a lost child who just found her mother. She let out a breath that was almost a laugh, and a small, trembling smile curled at her lips.

I turned to her, helping her off the floor. “Alina, we don’t have much time.”

She took my hand slowly, like she was afraid she’d wake up if she moved too fast. Her fingers were cold and delicate, but they gripped mine like she didn’t want to let go, a light smirk playing on her lips.

I peaked out the door. I didn’t see anyone. Then I turned back to Alina.

“Can you walk?” I asked.

“I think so.” She then winced. Her balance swayed as she stood, her hand slapping against the wall to steady herself.

“Then we’re leaving. Right now.”

We stepped out into the heavy, damp night air. The parking lot was still empty—no headlights, no engines, no sign of the other traffickers. We both emerged from the room. But she was still wobbly, holding onto the doorframe for support. I turned back to her.

“Ugh. My head.” She said holding a hand to her head.

Without thinking, I moved back to her, and swept her up into my arms. She was lighter than I expected—like she was made of silk and bone and smoke. Her arms instinctively wrapped around my neck, her face resting just under my chin. I felt her breath on my collarbone. Soft, yet Shaky. The snakes on her head curled quietly, docile now, like they too had calmed.

After a few steps, I felt her shift slightly in my arms.

“You smell like… laundry detergent,” she murmured, voice barely audible.

I tilted my head. “Is… that a bad thing?”

“It’s… warm,” she said, slightly giggling. “You’re warm.”

I glanced down. Her cheeks had gone faintly pink, and she was staring up at me, eyelids heavy. That little smile returned, slightly drowsy, but undeniably real. Something soft bloomed between us, buried beneath the fear and bruises and neon motel lights.

As we walked over to the car, she reached up with her hand to trace my jawline, her touch featherlight—like she wasn’t sure I was solid. Her smile brightened, a flicker of something radiant breaking through the haze of everything she'd endured.

I opened the passenger door for her. She hesitated only a moment before slipping in, curling up against the seat like it was the first real rest she’d had in days. Maybe weeks. As I pulled away from the laundromat, the silence in the car felt different. Not empty. Just… full of things we couldn’t say yet.

The cite rolled past in blurred halos of orange and blue. Traffic lights blinked on empty corners. Planes cut across the sky far overhead, heading to places that still felt like fiction to people like us. Every now and then, I could feel her eyes on me. Watching. Studying. Not in fear, but in curiosity. Like she was trying to memorize me. Each time I glanced over, she’d quickly look away, but not before I caught the edge of a smile playing on her lips.

Outside, the streets of Miami drifted by, quiet and gleaming with midnight sheen. But inside that car, something had changed. This wasn’t a rescue anymore. It wasn’t survival.

It was the start of something else.

Something far more nefarious than a local escort ring.

I pulled into the quiet suburban street just after 2:00 a.m. The neighborhood was still, with only the hum of distant sprinklers and the occasional wind chime from a neighbor’s porch disturbed the silence. The house sat near the end of the cul-de-sac. I always found some comfort in its symmetry allowing me a clear view of the whole circle.

I parked in the driveway, shut off the engine, and turned to Alina. She was asleep the whole ride, her head resting against the passenger window.

“We’re here.” I said flatly.

She got up and opened her eyes. Her snakes twitched softly under the dome light.

I got out and opened the passenger side door for her, offering my hand. She looked up at me tenderly, her snakes hissing quietly, sniffing my hand with their forked tongues. She reached up and took it with a smirk, fluttering her eyes up at me as she stumbled out of the vehicle and onto her feet.

She winced once when her bare foot touched the concrete, but she said nothing. Her arms clung to mine as they moved, probably still getting over the effects of the drugs. She gradually, however, regained her footing.

Inside, the house smelled faintly of lavender fragrances and books. The kind of place that held warmth in the walls and memories in the carpet. It was a typical suburban home.

“My dads in New York with his fiancée,” I explained, leading her down the hall. “And my mom’s in Texas visiting my aunt. I’m house-sitting. Keeping things in shape. Paying rent. It’s not much, but it’s safe.”

She didn’t say a word as her eyes went all around the house, quietly taking in the framed photos, the soft lighting, the reality of it all. She looked like she didn’t know whether to cry or collapse. I stopped at the guest room door and opened it for her.

There was a clean queen-sized bed with folded gray blankets, a small desk, a reading lamp, and a single dresser. But compared to where she'd come from, it might as well have been heaven. She walked in slowly, running her fingers along the blanket, like she was scared it would disappear. Then she turned to me.

""Martin?"" she said softly.

I tilted my head from the doorway. “Yeah?”

“Can you… stay with me?” Her voice cracked just slightly. “Just for tonight. I don’t… I don’t want to be alone.”

I hesitated for a beat. Not because I didn’t want to—but because of the way she looked up at me. From her 5'2 height, tilted her chin, her golden-green eyes wide and shimmering under the soft hallway light. Her snakes curled slightly inward, almost bashful, like they were reflecting her nervousness

I rubbed the back of my neck. “Oh-Ok.”

She smiled, an actual, genuine smile, gleaming pearly whites. The tension in her shoulders dropped. She climbed onto the bed slowly, curling up near the pillows but leaving space beside her.

I slowly sauntered over and sat down at the edge of the bed, unsure of what to do. I felt awkward, towering beside her, my 5'11 frame making the bed dip slightly. But she didn’t seem to mind. If anything, she scooted closer.

“Are you gonna lie down?” she pouted, looking up at me with longing eyes.

I nodded, then slowly rested next to her. She immediately snuggled up next to me and buried her face in my neck, wrapping her arm around my torso. She curled gently into my side. I could feel her smiling and giggling

“You’re warm.” she purred.

I looked down at her, and then really noticed how delicate, yet beautiful she looked under the lamplight. Bruised, but strong. Shaken, but resilient. And… Jesus Christ she was gorgeous.

I just reached over and pulled the blanket up around us both and killed the light. Her breathing slowed. Her snakes finally went still.

I laid back with her, letting the silence wrap around us like another layer of warmth.

And just before sleep pulled her under, she murmured, almost inaudibly:

“Thank you.”

“Don’t mention it.” I half smiled.

And in the dark, with her hand on my chest and her cheek against his shoulder, she finally closed her eyes. I did too.

We broke up earlier this year. I’m avoidant, she’s anxious. Two months before the breakup she almost ended things, but we worked through it. Two months later she ended it for real. Her reason: she felt emotionally dependent on me, couldn’t go more than a few days without seeing me, and needed space to figure herself out.

It was a respectful breakup no drama, just love and best wishes. I gave her the space she wanted, cut contact, and focused on myself. Since then I’ve been to therapy, learned about our attachment styles, crushed it at work, and traveled a lot. I’ve grown a ton.

Four months after the breakup she reached out to return a few of my things. I kept it short: just grabbed my stuff, no small talk. Recently, I’ve noticed little signals that make me wonder if she still feels something.

Now I’m debating asking her for coffee. My goal isn’t to rehash the past but to get clarity: does she see a future, or is it 100% done? Living with the uncertainty has been draining.

A survival guide for founders and skeptics","Remember when AI was a research paper and a slightly smug keynote? Cute. Now it shows up at your mom's wrist, at the makeup counter, and in the procurement deck for your largest enterprise client. Apple surfaces blood-pressure alerts on a Watch like a guilty relative pointing out your shortcomings. Mary Kay offers AI-powered makeup styling like a kindly robot with a better concealer algorithm. Dell rolls out an “AI Factory” so enterprises can scale models the way they scale coffee orders. Mustek buys a stake in Business AI; Afreximbank promises trade compliance via models. And somewhere a VC says, ""product-market fit,"" and laughs maniacally.

If you build things—apps, devices, dashboards—this matters. For founders and indie hackers: the market isn't waiting for perfect models. It's waiting for productized value. That means narrow models that solve narrow, repeatable decisions — not the general intelligence fantasy. A watch that flags a blood-pressure anomaly and routes you to a human clinician is defensible. A lipstick recommender that increases online conversion for a particular shade palette is monetizable.

For consultants and enterprise sellers: don’t sell the model, sell the pipeline and the trust. Enterprises want predictable integration, repeatable data hygiene, and an escape hatch when the model hallucinates. Build observability, allow human override, and price for the ongoing data work — not theoretical accuracy percentages.

For skeptics: your paranoia is a feature. Regulation, privacy backlash, and model brittleness are real. Use them as product constraints. Compliance is not an obstacle — it’s a moat if you can bake it into onboarding.

Opportunities? Many. Small verticalized tools, data-first consultancies that ship MLops playbooks, UX patterns that make model uncertainty legible, and horizontal platforms that handle identity, consent, and audit logs for regulated industries.

The punchline: AI is no longer a lab trick. It’s a distribution channel. Treat it like a product: small, testable, instrumented, and built for humans who will inevitably try to break it.

1nnapic,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1nnapic/dream_job_might_be_out_of_reach_for_autistic/,Dream job might be out of reach for autistic adult. Advice please,"Hello y'all. This is a long one. Tldr below. 

I 25(F) have run into something of a realization regarding how I am treated at work places and I need some advice. For relevance I was diagnosed with Asperger's at the age of 8 but I wasn't told until I was 17. Additionally I am one of 6 children and half of us have autism and I am considered high functioning. But I struggle daily with social interactions.

So, ever since I was in third grade I wanted to become a teacher. My teacher was particularly kind to me and I adored her. I grew up never considering another career. As I got older I slowly realized I was a bit different from other kids. I didn't make friends easily but I Velcroed myself to those who stuck around. Again I didn't know I was diagnosed with anything and I suspect that affected how I saw myself growing up.

Some background.

I have worked at multiple childcare types of jobs. My favorite was a boy scout merit badge director. I also had an internship at a planetarium where I did ""star talks"" essentially I got free range on the sky dome and got to teach the audience about anything I wanted for 15 minutes before a show. I also worked at a very popular coffee shop for nearly 4 years before leaving for this current job opportunity.

This new job stretched me unlike any experience I have ever had before. And it has been extremely difficult to not just up and quit. 
I may have met my breaking point. This job started out confusing. I applied for an assistant position and they offered me the full lead teacher position for their summer camp at a private school. I accepted since it sounded similar to the boy scout position. I was ecstatic. 

I started my first day and had the lead preschool person come to me asking what I had planned for preschool. I panicked for a second because I was in charge of watching and teaching the 5 year olds and older. I was told not to teach preschool but apparently I missed where they wanted me to PLAN preschool.

By some grace of God I panicked for about 5 minutes and came up with some lesson plan right out of my butt and handed it to her with the materials out of the supply room and all was well.

I came to realize I had expectations I wasn't told about before hand OR it was something I didn't understand fully when they described it to me originally. Sometimes I need absolute ""Explain it to me like I'm 5 years old"" instructions when I enter something new. I was cooked.

After the initial misunderstanding I started doing all the things people came to me for but I had a few parent interactions that were very hard. Eventually the summer was ending and I was excited to start a new, less demanding, position at the school.
They offered me an assistant nursery position so I took it and we had a meeting about what to expect a week before it started. 
They asked about my experience and I said I had more experience with children 2-4 than 0-1. So I was placed in the toddler room. 
I asked for a detailed job description this time to avoid the misunderstandings from the last position. I never received it. I had a week to plan for the new room but I didn't know what they wanted me to plan for. I emailed about what criteria I needed to match for preschool readiness and asked why I hadn't received the day schedule for the children.
I got a rather blunt and almost short tempered email back that basically said they don't have the information yet. I wasn't sure what to do. So I had to completely make up a day schedule and made a weeks of lesson plans in just two days. I ended up using chat gpt for a few things since I had literally no idea what to do.

Why would it be up to a brand new associate graduate to be responsible for the actual CREATION of an entire program in less than a week? I got an email back around this time about how the preschool teachers would visit me in the end of our second week to discuss what I should teach? Two weeks late?
So they come and it's just.. week one ""all about me"" week 2 ""my name"" and literally no other information.
I thankfully remembered a lot of the stuff from school being expected of this age group like teaching how to hold a pencil, name, color, shape and size recognition. Fine and gross motor play. Potty training, etc.
But I felt strange that none of these things were even brought up in this discussion. 

Now, this is the part where I need advice. Now that I have been in the position for about a month I have wanted to quit since week 2. I feel like the main boss stopped liking me since I have ""failed"" to meet their outrageous criteria for what was originally supposed to be an assistant position. But I am all by myself in a separate room from the other nursery staff with seven 2 year olds. For 9 hours. mon-fri. I've had a parent who also works at the school complain about me for not changing her daughter on time. I've heard other things but she's the only one who has ever said anything to me. She was upset her daughter hadn't been changed yet even though it wasn't time on my daily schedule to change the children and she came 20 minutes early. I felt it was unfair. She has since complained about me to my boss and honestly I'm over working here.
I had a talk with my boss where I wanted to bring up all the miscommunications I've experienced working there and all she said was that I need to do better. That I am not socializing well enough with the children. 

That hit me hard. I realized my ability to socialize was actually the reason my boss was distancing herself from me. I also saw online a few weeks ago my position at the school was posted to hire. Which I thought was weird but this place was slow for everything so I didn't think much of it. But then I was told at this meeting that they were already conducting interviews for ""another person for the toddler room"". They didn't say assistant. The posting was for my position.
With all this I am good and done with this place. But I feel I may not be cut out for being a teacher. I have learned it has incredibly long hours, a ton of social challenges and without a strong support system I'm incapable of keeping up.

I never thought my social skills wouldn't be enough for the one thing I wanted to do in life. And this isn't the first place to have mentioned having trouble with my.. lack of abilities.
Granted I know I have grown a lot since having multiple jobs but maybe I should try another career path? Perhaps one with clearer expectations and more balanced responsibilities.
I want to leave as soon as possible without burning this bridge. How can I salvage this?

T.L.D.R. I want to leave my dream job because my social skills may not live up to workplace expectations. And it has been horrible with communication and has blamed me for what I believe is their short coming. Also I want to leave this job without burning any bridges but I'm at my wits end.",3,1758507995.0,autism,2,1.0,False

I haven't played many immersive sims (OG Deus Ex, Cruelty Squad, Dishonored 1 - Cruelty Squad's the only one I outright enjoyed through and through) and based off of that video, I was expecting the game to end up easily turning into a fun power fantasy with unique, cool powers and weapons like turning into objects, blasting enemies with psychic attacks, and grenades that recycle objects and enemies into materials to gain resources to make more upgrades and gain even more powers easily. Unfortunately, Prey 2017 was in fact *not* that, and was in reality a survival much more survival horror-oriented, with resources always being scarce and choices being deliberately hamstrung by said scarcity as to force decision making and problem solving. [I made a post on another subreddit with more details on my thoughts,] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmersiveSim/comments/1n5ehb1/i_didnt_like_prey_2017_what_are_some_immersive/?ref=share&ref_source=link) and also got some immersive sim/imsim-adjacent recs, though based on the responses I got in that thread, I feel immersive sims aren't for me and/or what I was looking for, yet I still feel very unsatisfied since my experience with Prey 2017.

What are games that ACTUALLY fulfill what I wanted from Prey 2017: a game that doesn't restrict your resource usage, lets you use a bunch of cool, unique powers that are fun to use, and can be broken very easily? I love the idea of turning into a coffee mug and vaporizing an enemy who looks and breathes in your direction with an explosive mind blast, but as far as I know, Prey is the only game that lets you do something like that, albeit by consuming a heavy amount of psi that can't be replenished easily, and I haaaaaate that. If failing even that, something that just lets me destroy enemies with brute force or style. Also, the recommendations don't have to be limited to immersive sims or even FPSes, though action-oriented games are preferred.

1nnapfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nnapfw/am_i_overreacting_roommate_not_as_clean_as_i_had/,Am I Overreacting? Roommate not as clean as I had thought was “normal.”,"For some background, I am married and live with my husband and his sister/my sister-in-law in a two bedroom apartment. For the sake of clarity, I will simply refer to her as a roommate.

I grew up in a very Asian household. Cleanliness was everything. I was put to clean a lot of things when I had free time. I learned at a very early age how to tolerate the harshness of bleach safely. I carried everything I learned about cleaning into adulthood and I pride myself in staying clean and organized.

I married a man who I knew does not have the same knack for cleanliness that I do. We’ve had many arguments about it, but now he’s at the point where I don’t have to police him about leaving a mess. Things have been harmonious since then. I learned he is not the only one guilty of being less conscious of cleanliness when I started living with him and his sister.

To anyone curious, no, I did not consent to living all together in the same apartment. I found out that this would be the arrangement a bit too late before we signed the lease, and I haven’t had the heart to throw her out because she’s actually a good person (though I have made it final we will be getting our own place when our lease ends).

So unfortunately, his sister is not great at cleaning up unless there is company coming over. Any time she uses the kitchen to make coffee or food, I will always find residue of sauces, powders, and liquids on the counter. I have seen the fridge with her old expired food in the back with visible mold and sticky remnants of drinks slightly spilled. Shit, I’ve seen a nearly empty bag of potato chips on the floor near the door to her room that started attracting ANTS.

She has sent me into her room once to retrieve something for her, and it is…a mess. Bear in mind we are all past our mid-20s.

In general, with our shared living spaces, she has the habit of leaving out dishes (sometimes for days on end) and leaving crumbs/small trash pieces on the floor to just be.

This is all very striking to me because my mother would have sent me straight to hell had I left my dishes on the table after a meal. I get most of my cleaning is out of trauma, but at least I’m not messy.

I acknowledge I’m not perfect either. I walk with shoes on in our apartment sometimes, and take my bike in and out without a worry, but all because I know I have every other Sunday to look forward to mopping the floor…which she has never offered to do. Or any deep cleaning of the kitchen or patio for that matter.

So, AIO? I have no idea what cleanliness is supposed to be to the average person.",1,1758507988.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False
1nnapdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1nnapdc/in_biglaw_its_not_just_the_billable_hours_that/,"In Biglaw, it's not just the billable hours that give you nightmares. PART I","I don’t know if writing this down will make any difference, but I need to get this out. Somewhere. Anywhere. I just finished my first month at Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern, a well known prestigious white shoe firm in downtown Brickell. I remember the interview like it was yesterday. It happened in a upscale resort in downtown Miami. They offered me a gargantuan salary, unbelievable benefits, and even a luxury vehicle. It was too good to be true.

But before everything went to hell, it started the way all good fairy tales do.

In a penthouse suite. A perk for working at Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern.

I was standing in front of a full-length mirror in our bedroom fit for royalty, adjusting the lapels of my brand-new suit. Navy blue, crisp, tailored exactly to my short frame. The jacket still smelled faintly like plastic and starch from the department store. My hair—short, black, parted neatly at the side—framed my face in a way I hoped made me look like someone who deserved to be walking into a place like Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern.

I tugged on the cuff of my blouse and tried to picture the week ahead: billable hours, conference rooms, and late nights hunched over documents. All the things I’d fought for in law school. All the things that were supposed to prove that everything from the volleyball scholarships to the law review, and endless nights of outlines and coffee were worth it.

Behind me, leaning in the bedroom doorway, was my tall, handsome fiancée, Derek.

God, Derek. 6’3, broad shoulders still carrying traces of his college football days. A crisp gray suit that looked like it belonged in GQ. He had the same smile he wore at our wedding just a few months ago. It was confident, easy, the kind of smile that convinced anyone they were exactly where they belonged just by being next to him.

“You look like trouble,” he said, smirking.

I rolled my eyes, but I couldn’t help but smile. “Trouble? I’m starting my first week at one of the most prestigious white shoe firms in Brickell. That’s not trouble, that’s destiny.”

“Mm,” he said, pushing off the doorframe and crossing the room toward me. “Destiny, trouble. Same thing when you’re five-foot-one and have fire in your veins.” He kissed the top of my head, then leaned down so our eyes met in the mirror. “Is my tiny tornado ready to conquer the world?”

My cheeks burned instantly. He always did that, slipping in that pet name that made me sound both ridiculous and invincible. “Don’t call me that,” I muttered.

“Why not?” His reflection grinned back at me. “You’re five-one, Jackie. You whirl into people’s lives, knock them off their feet, and spin right out before they know what hit them. You’re my little tornado. And today? You’re about to tear through Brickell.”

I swatted him in the chest, laughing despite myself. “You’re so cheesy.”

“Cheesy gets results.” he said, and bent to kiss me.

On the dresser behind us sat our engagement photo album, spread open to a photo of us under an arch of white roses. It was a public proposal at a private gala. My parents were beaming, and my baby cousin was throwing petals. Derek held me like the world was his to keep. For that moment, I let myself breathe it in. My life was so perfect back then.

Had I known about the secrets that Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern were keeping?

I would have walked out of that penthouse and taken the first plane to Antarctica.

“Come on,” Derek said, slipping his watch onto his wrist. “Train leaves in fifteen. Don’t want Miami to think their star recruit is late her first day.”

I playfully hit him as we walked out that door.

And that was probably the last time I saw him, or my life, in such a positive light.

We left our penthouse at seven sharp, the morning sun bouncing off Biscayne Bay, glittering like someone had scattered diamonds across the water. Derek’s hand found mine as we walked to the metro station, our steps in sync, the city already humming with movement.

On the platform, he squeezed my hand. “So,” he said, tilting his head down at me, “big bad law firm ready for you?”

I smirked. “The question is…am I ready for them?”

He chuckled. “That’s my girl.”

The cart was crowded, but we found a spot near the doors. Business suits, briefcases, the faint buzz of people reciting presentations under their breath. Miami mornings smelled like cologne, coffee, and ambition. It was a small car that alternated between stations. The rail system in downtown Brickell was not at all like it was in New York.

The cart glided into Brickell. There were crowds of people below us as we exited the cart and stepped out into the flow of commuters, the heat already thick in the air.

After a few blocks of walking, we reached two tall skyscrapers that were adjacent to each other.

Derek leaned down, kissed me quick, and nodded toward his building right next to ours. “Go on, Tiny Tornado. Time to make partner before lunch.”

I grinned, swatting his shoulder softly as we kissed one more time before we both went to different buildings.

Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern loomed ahead of me. A forty-story tower of black glass, the letters *SSS* gleaming in silver near the top. My chest tightened as I walked through the revolving doors into the marble lobby. Everything was polished to a mirror shine, including the floors, pillars, and even the elevator doors.

I caught a glimpse of myself again on the smooth surface of the elevator door. Small frame, neat suit, determined eyes. The elevator ride was silent, the kind where everyone stares at the floor numbers because looking at each other feels like trespassing.

When the doors slid open on the associates’ floor, she was already waiting. Her voice was smooth, clipped, practiced. A woman in her mid-forties stood there, hair hanging loosely past her shoulders, pearl necklace, and a navy suit that probably cost more than my car.

“Jackie Delgado?”

She was Marsha Dawes, one of the firm’s partners. I’d read about her. Ruthless litigator. Built her reputation eating opposing counsel alive in depositions.

“Yes, that’s me.” I said, forcing a smile and extending my hand.

She shook it briefly, her grip cool and precise as a light smile tugged at her lips. “Welcome to Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern. We’ve been expecting you.”

Her eyes lingered on me, like she was sizing me up for something far more than my résumé.

And in that moment, standing in the polished hall of one of the most prestigious white shoe firms in Miami, I swear something shifted. The way she smiled—it wasn’t warm, it wasn’t welcoming.

It was knowing.

Like she already had plans for me.

“Come this way,” Ms. Dawes said, pivoting on her heels with military precision. Jackie fell into step beside her, heels clicking against the immaculate marble floor.

We moved through a maze of hushed hallways lined with closed office doors. The carpet swallowed sound, the kind of luxury flooring meant to make clients feel as though their secrets were safe here, trapped inside a impenetrable vault, or a marble polished coffin.

Every wall was adorned with carefully chosen artwork, ranging from abstract canvases to impressionist pieces that seemed both meaningless yet expensive. The silence was dense, broken only by the occasional muted phone call or the faint shuffle of papers behind closed doors.

“We’ll get you set up with your office and introduce you to some of the team.” Ms. Dawes said, her voice calm, clipped, yet slightly chipper. She walked with her hands clasped lightly in front of her, posture flawless.

I nodded, trying to keep my own steps steady. The sheer scale of the place was daunting, but there was something exhilarating about it too. This was *it*—everything I worked toward all my life.

As they walked, Ms. Dawes added, “Just listen, learn, and don’t be afraid to ask questions. Everyone here was once in your shoes.” She glanced sideways at me with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “And remember, Ms. Delgado, the letter you received from Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern was the only one we sent out this year. We wanted you.”

I blinked. The only one? She opened her mouth to respond, but before she could, Ms. Dawes continued, her voice a notch lower.

“Have you selected the vehicle yet? It’s all part of the onboarding package.”

I tilted my head. “The… vehicle?”

“Yes.” Ms. Dawes said matter-of-factly, as if she were asking whether Jackie had picked out her desk chair. “Most associates choose the firm’s standard issue—this year we’ve partnered with Mercedes. The EQE sedan, electric, top of the line.” Her lips split into a wide, toothy smile. “The Mercedes is just one of the many perks you’ll have. You’ll want to look into the options by the end of the week.”

I was lightheaded. A car? Just handed to me like another piece of office equipment? It seemed surreal. That should have been a glaring red flag. But I was blinded by the casual nonchalant tone inn Marsha’s voice as the rational part of my brain dulled the reptilian side. It was a white shoe firm, so it wasn’t too uncommon.

Right?

“Of course. Thank you. I’ll look into it.”

“Good,” Ms. Dawes replied, her heels clicking a beat faster.

We stopped in front of a door with a gleaming silver plaque. My heart stuttered when she read the engraving:

**Jackie Delgado, Associate**

My name. On an office door. This felt so unreal. Between the Mercedes, my own office, and the starting salary of two hundred and fifty grand, this had to be a fever dream.

Oh how I wish it WAS a fever dream.

Ms. Dawes opened it with a small flourish, stepping aside to let Jackie in. The room was bright, modern, and absurdly spacious compared to the cramped student lounges and libraries she’d lived in for years. Floor-to-ceiling windows stretched across one wall, revealing a stunning view of the Brickell skyline. The sunlight poured in, bouncing off glass towers, the Miami River below glinting like a ribbon of light.

“Welcome to your new domain,” Ms. Dawes said, allowing the faintest curl of a smile to appear on her lips. “I’ll leave you to get settled. My door is always open if you need anything.”

I nodded, unable to find my voice, but Ms. Dawes was already striding down the hallway, her figure disappearing around the corner.

My first real office. Not a borrowed cubicle. Not a library desk. *My office.* A tangible symbol of years of sweat, sacrifice, and relentless drive.

I set my bag on the sleek white desk and walked to the window. From here I had a scenic view of the docks and the Biscayne Bay, our condo standing proudly against the horizon. I walked over to the glass, taking in the view. It was incredible.

The hushed atmosphere of the firm. The expensive artwork in the hallways. The quiet efficiency of the staff. The air smelled faintly of citrus polish and money. Everything here spoke of power, prestige, permanence.

I lowered myself into the plush leather chair behind the desk, the seat enveloping her as though it had been waiting for her all along. My gaze swept the room—the empty shelves, the spotless desk, the waiting phone.

Why, WHY didn’t I notice the red flags? Why didn’t I take my grandfather’s advice?

I remembered my graduation from the University of Miami, the day I received my JD. Her family in the stands, faces glowing with pride. My father crying happy tears. My sister waving furiously, snapping photo after photo.

And her grandfather.

He had clapped politely, even smiled for the pictures, but his eyes had been… skeptical. Distant. As if he knew something the rest of them didn’t.

“You’re too good for places like that,” he’d whispered when they hugged. “You think they want you, Jackie. They don’t want you. They want what you’ll give up for them. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.”

I had brushed it off at the time. Old man nerves. Overprotective worry.

But now, sitting in her pristine office with her name on the door, the memory tugged at my chest like a loose thread.

For the rest of that month, my life felt like a dream.

Work was steady, even exciting. Derek and I slipped into a routine: waking together, coffee on the balcony, splitting off into the Brickell crowds, meeting again on the train home. At night, we cooked together or went out with friends, laughing too loud in bars that overlooked the water.

At the firm, I was fed the kind of work every first-year associate gets: client memos, research assignments, and document review. None of it glamorous, but none of it sinister either.

At least, not at first.

“Okay, ladies, which one of you is ordering the second bottle?” Daniela asked, twirling her wine glass in the Brickell café where we always met for lunch.

“I’ve got depositions this afternoon.” Sophie groaned, shoving her salad aside. “If I show up tipsy, Dawes will have my head.”

Alexa smirked. “Please. Dawes probably downs two martinis before breakfast.”

I chuckled, shaking my head. “Don’t let her hear you say that. I swear the walls in that place have ears.”

“She that bad?” Daniela asked.

“No,” I admitted. “Honestly, she’s been… helpful. I think she likes me.” I said managing a light smile.

“Of course she does.” Sophie said, raising her glass in a mock toast. “Top of your class, volleyball star, law review golden girl. What’s not to like?”

Alexa leaned in. “I bet it’s Derek. Six-three, investment banker, looks like he walked out of a cologne ad. She probably thinks if she treats you right, you’ll bring him to the Christmas party.”

I rolled my eyes, laughing. “You’re terrible.”

“That’s why you love me, Jackie girl!” Alexa grinned.

The four of us talked about everything from weddings, to work, and Netflix shows. It was all so normal I almost forgot I was still the new girl at the most intimidating firm in Miami. Or that i felt something festering below the surface of my senses.

Almost.

That night, back in my office, I opened another file from Ms. Dawes. It was a standard-looking client binder: trust documents, contracts, corporate registrations, financial statements, and even tax returns.

But the tax ID number had an extra digit. thirteen numbers where there should have been nine.

At first I thought it was a typo. But when I keyed it into the firm’s system, the entry resolved into a real profile: a hedge fund registered out of…

… *nowhere*. *Yet somewhere.*

The jurisdiction zip code did not match anything I’d seen. Not offshore havens like the Caymans or Luxembourg. Nothing I could trace. It was just a string of symbols that looked almost mathematical.

No. Mathematical is an understatement. It looked… **mythical.**

I looked up from my screen and closed the file, forcing myself to breathe. It was probably some internal coding system.

The next morning, I found another file. This one looked like a normal investment portfolio. Except the timestamps on the trades were wrong. Yet, they weren’t. I checked the client bank records and deposition notes.

***They were all recorded. And they confirmed everything I read.***

An account had invested in a defense contractor ***the day before*** they announced a massive government contract. They bought options in a tech company ***hours before*** the CEO’s scandal tanked the stock.

I stared at the dates, the hours, the precision of it. It wasn’t luck. It wasn’t even insider trading. It was impossible.

“Everything okay in there?” Daniela’s voice came through the door, startling me.

I snapped the folder shut. “Yeah! Just buried in paper.”

“Welcome to the rest of your life!” she called back, and I could hear her laughing as she walked down the hall.

Later that week, Dawes dropped another file onto my desk herself.

“Preliminary review,” she said crisply. “Flag anything unusual.”

“Of course.” I smiled weakly, pretending that I DIDN’T read what I read or saw what I saw on those hearing and deposition notes.

She started to walk away, then paused. “Don’t overthink anything. Half the work we do is making the impossible look routine.”

I forced a smile. “Understood.”

When I opened the file, I nearly laughed. It was an account ledger for a small religious foundation. But the foundation’s charter dated back further than any I’d seen—so far back it couldn’t be real.

And this was when my instincts stopped whispering and ***began to scream.***

Clay tablets, Babylonian cuneiform, scanned into the file. The entity had supposedly “merged” with three different cults over the centuries. They each had their own god, each absorbed seamlessly into the “modern foundation.”

The current directors had names I didn’t recognize, except one. A professor I’d read about in undergrad anthropology. Only he’d been declared missing in 1997.

But the signature on the audit line looked fresh.

I checked the deposition and hearing letters once more. And my heart fell in my chest upon seeing that said clients ***existed.***  

I sat back in my chair, pressing my fingers to my temples.

“What the hell?” I whispered silently to myself. “Is this supposed to be a prank?”

I wanted to ask Marsha about it. But she was out that evening. She had to meet a client.

At lunch that Friday, Sophie was venting about a partner’s demands.

“I swear, they think we’re robots,” she said. “Do you know what it’s like to proof three hundred pages of contracts in six hours?”

“Sounds like Tuesday.” Alexa muttered.

I sipped my iced tea, smiling faintly, though my mind wasn’t in the conversation. I was increasingly unsettled by the files I kept working on. I kept thinking about the numbers in those files, the way they didn’t add up but still somehow… resolved.

Or about the zip codes to locations that seemingly didn’t exist in any physical space. Or about the hearing logs and litigation reports filed with the clerk of courts that proved the existence of clients that were shadowy organizations.

“You’re quiet,” Daniela said suddenly.

I blinked. “Just tired. Long week.”

Derek texted me later: *Dinner at eight. Wear that red dress I like.*

I smiled, typing back, *Always.*

I didn’t tell him about the file with the trades, or the cult, or the tax IDs that mapped to places I couldn’t find. I wanted to believe it was a prank. A mean, cruel hazing ritual my sorority liked to pull with the freshmen.

But that cold feeling settled into my gut. A feeling of mounting dread that raised the pitch in the voice of my instincts higher and higher as I did more legal work.

Each file felt like a pebble dropped into water, ripples spreading quietly, invisibly, until you realized the whole surface had shifted. And by the end of that first month, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was no longer looking at my work.

It was looking at me.

Hey you, moved back here over a couple of years ago. Wouldn't say I'm tied down here. Currently a corporate slave, business girly. Basically sold half my soul 🥹 Looks like you too are venturing this hellish landscape. Gotta say, the apps suck here, so that 1% chance the universe does its thing here on Reddit of all places lol. 

Ahhh outside of that, I like to make art and music, cooking, reading, self care, museums, games, chilling with my dog and friends. Rainy days, snow, matcha, anime, nature, sunrises, speak a couple of languages, 21 countries and counting. I like to appreciate the nice moments, leaves changing color, laying on my bed after a billion hours of work, sound of rain on my window, first sip of coffee and moreee.

Looking for my person. A genuine connection with a good guy. My nail tech says I need a sweetie pie, yknow to match my Libra vibes. Not into hook up culture, big drinkers, smokers or sharing hehe.

*Lies a box that's always ringing*

*Where the angels keep on winning*

*And the singers keep on singing*

  
""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" 

To say that phrase took a weight off my shoulders would be the understatement of the century. I'd been working on this mission for well over a year, going over every minute detail with a fine-tooth comb. All those sleepless nights, the mountains of paperwork, the carpal tunnel syndrome from the chalkboard, it was all finally complete. I cried, I won't lie to you. A lot of us did. But we still had work to do. Landing on the moon was only step one, we still had to get Buzz and Neil home after all. After Neil took his famous steps and the boys began their duties, all of us in Houston settled down a bit. The cameras were set up, Walter Cronkite got on air, and it was go time.

  
""How's it looking out there Buzz?"" a voice from behind me said. I turned to see Charles Duke take a long drag of a cigarette from a shaky hand. Duke was one of our CAPCOM guys, and had direct communications with Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins.

""Boy, it is something else up here I'll tell you. It is something else"" Aldrin replied. 

""Now keep a hold on yourself Buzz"" Duke said, ""You've only got a few hundred million eyes watching!""

  
A laugh filled the room. Joking was good, especially after how tense the pre-landing atmosphere was. Working on a project like this, you get really attached to its success. Now that Buzz and Niel were out of the landing module, it was time for me to get down to business. I was on the geology team. Doesn't sound groundbreaking, but it was at the time. We only had theories on what we'd find up there. Scientific hypotheses and assumptions are great and all, but they only get you so far. The first step of the surface mission was to collect some lunar dust samples. Once these got back to earth, I was one of the lucky few who got to handle it. With all the excitement over the successful landing, I was a little worried the guys would forget to bring me back any souvenirs. I glanced over at Duke, he was much calmer now. He saw my gaze and nodded.

  
""Alright Niel enough fooling around, make sure you get us that sample"" Duke said

""Roger that"" Armstrong replied. He pulled out his sample bag and collected a chunk of lunar dust. He placed it into his space suit compartment and moved on to his next task. Before I could see Armstrong's next task, the room erupted into applause. I looked up to see that Buzz Aldrin had planted the American Flag on the moon. Boy, that made me patriotic. I wondered what my dad would think. I didn't remember much of him, I was only six when he died. Cut down at Luzon only four days before the war ended. I hadn't thought about my old man in a while, but once I saw that flag flying on the lunar surface, he was all I could think about. After a phone call with President Nixon and a bit of kangaroo hopping on around the moon's craters, the tv cameras cut. Lucky for us in the command center, our cameras kept rolling.

  
""Sorry you missed this dad"" I thought

  
Once the cheers died down, the astronauts went back to finishing their mission objectives.

  
""Hey Buzz, don't forget the Dutch want one of those moon rocks"" Duke relayed. The Dutch ambassador had visited the launch site to give the astronauts messages of good luck from the people of the Netherlands, and one from the Queen herself. All he asked for in return, was a moon rock.

  
""Good call, let me go find a good one for the ambassador"" Aldrin replied.

  
At this point I got up from my desk and made my way to the back of the command center. After so many weeks of high stress, I felt more peace than I had in a long time. I was grabbing another cup of coffee when Duke came up and put his arm around me.

  
""Hell of a thing, isn't it?"" he said

  
""Yeah"" I replied ""Doesn't feel real quite yet""

  
""I'll say"" Duke said, taking another drag of his cigarette, ""The greatest achievement in history. That's what they're saying""

  
""At least they're modest"" I joked. Duke gave a hearty laugh, giving me a pat on the back. He turned around to check in on the astronauts.

  
""Hey Buzz, give me an update will you?"" Duke asked, but he was met with silence. I didn't notice, communication ran into hiccups all the time.

  
""Buzz?"" Duke said again ""Come in Bu-"" he stopped. At this point, I realized the whole room had stopped. You could hear a pin drop. I turned around to see what was going on. I looked up to the screens, and my coffee dropped from my hand. I was so transfixed, I barely even noticed the scalding hot liquid splash my shins.

  
Buzz had picked up a rock for the Dutch ambassador, the largest one around that was still small enough to take back in the lunar module. But the rock had a message. It was written plain as day on its underside:

  
""WE HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE

WE WILL BE HERE AGAIN

6812 6812 6812 6812

SATURN LISTENS

BREAK THE LOOP""

  
It felt like an eternity until anyone moved or spoke. It felt like my brain was on fire, I couldn't think. How do you comprehend the uncomprehensible? What did this mean? My mind was moving at a million miles per hour, when someone spoke.

  
""Is the cable feed off?"" Duke asked, clearly shaken

  
Buzz was silent.

  
""Aldrin, do you copy? Is the cable feed off?"" Duke asked again, agitated

  
""Y-yes sir."" Buzz replied. I could sense the fear in his voice.

  
""Good. Take that specimen back with you but do not say a word about it. Copy? Not a fucking word."" Duke said

  
""Copy"" Buzz replied.

  
Duke took off his headset and put his head in his hands. The room was silent as a crypt. After collecting himself, Duke stood on his desk and addressed the room.

  
""There are only 62 people in this room"" Duke said, a somber tone in his voice, ""Nobody outside of this very room has seen that footage. None of you will say a word of what you saw, understand?""

  
""No!"" a voice shouted. One of the mathematicians protested. ""We can't just keep this quiet!"" she exclaimed.

  
Duke pleaded with her to calm down, but she couldn't. One of the directors ushered the sobbing woman into the hallway. I didn't realize at the time, but looking back on it now, she was never seen again.

  
The room remained silent, but we understood. This was far above all of us. I sat back down at my desk, still unable to grasp what had occurred. I wanted to speak. To Duke, to Buzz, to anyone. But I didn't. I followed my orders to the letter.

  
The astronauts followed their orders to secrecy too. Ever wonder why they look so sullen in their first interviews back on earth? If you held an incomprehensible inscription in your hand, you would too. I was never allowed to see the specimen. None of us were. Rumor was that the CIA confiscated it right out of the module when it splashed down. I left my job at NASA a few months later. I began teaching at my local university, but I could never get that message out of my head.

  
What was it? A warning? A riddle? What did Saturn mean? What about the numbers? Who left this for us? I saw the message in my dreams for weeks. I obsessed over it. I wrote and rewrote the message looking for any hidden meaning but I found nothing. Every night I would look at Saturn through my telescope, staring at the celestial body as if it were a painting. One day, I noticed. On Saturn's north pole, there was a storm. This storm was a hexagon, or closer to a cube. A cube. I fell to my knees. Saturn's cube.

  
A cube.

PART I","I don’t know if writing this down will make any difference, but I need to get this out. Somewhere. Anywhere. I just finished my first month at Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern, a well known prestigious white shoe firm in downtown Brickell. I remember the interview like it was yesterday. It happened in a upscale resort in downtown Miami. They offered me a gargantuan salary, unbelievable benefits, and even a luxury vehicle. It was too good to be true.

But before everything went to hell, it started the way all good fairy tales do.

In a penthouse suite. A perk for working at Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern.

I was standing in front of a full-length mirror in our bedroom fit for royalty, adjusting the lapels of my brand-new suit. Navy blue, crisp, tailored exactly to my short frame. The jacket still smelled faintly like plastic and starch from the department store. My hair—short, black, parted neatly at the side—framed my face in a way I hoped made me look like someone who deserved to be walking into a place like Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern.

I tugged on the cuff of my blouse and tried to picture the week ahead: billable hours, conference rooms, and late nights hunched over documents. All the things I’d fought for in law school. All the things that were supposed to prove that everything from the volleyball scholarships to the law review, and endless nights of outlines and coffee were worth it.

Behind me, leaning in the bedroom doorway, was my tall, handsome fiancée, Derek.

God, Derek. 6’3, broad shoulders still carrying traces of his college football days. A crisp gray suit that looked like it belonged in GQ. He had the same smile he wore at our wedding just a few months ago. It was confident, easy, the kind of smile that convinced anyone they were exactly where they belonged just by being next to him.

“You look like trouble,” he said, smirking.

I rolled my eyes, but I couldn’t help but smile. “Trouble? I’m starting my first week at one of the most prestigious white shoe firms in Brickell. That’s not trouble, that’s destiny.”

“Mm,” he said, pushing off the doorframe and crossing the room toward me. “Destiny, trouble. Same thing when you’re five-foot-one and have fire in your veins.” He kissed the top of my head, then leaned down so our eyes met in the mirror. “Is my tiny tornado ready to conquer the world?”

My cheeks burned instantly. He always did that, slipping in that pet name that made me sound both ridiculous and invincible. “Don’t call me that,” I muttered.

“Why not?” His reflection grinned back at me. “You’re five-one, Jackie. You whirl into people’s lives, knock them off their feet, and spin right out before they know what hit them. You’re my little tornado. And today? You’re about to tear through Brickell.”

I swatted him in the chest, laughing despite myself. “You’re so cheesy.”

“Cheesy gets results.” he said, and bent to kiss me.

On the dresser behind us sat our engagement photo album, spread open to a photo of us under an arch of white roses. It was a public proposal at a private gala. My parents were beaming, and my baby cousin was throwing petals. Derek held me like the world was his to keep. For that moment, I let myself breathe it in. My life was so perfect back then.

Had I known about the secrets that Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern were keeping?

I would have walked out of that penthouse and taken the first plane to Antarctica.

“Come on,” Derek said, slipping his watch onto his wrist. “Train leaves in fifteen. Don’t want Miami to think their star recruit is late her first day.”

I playfully hit him as we walked out that door.

And that was probably the last time I saw him, or my life, in such a positive light.

We left our penthouse at seven sharp, the morning sun bouncing off Biscayne Bay, glittering like someone had scattered diamonds across the water. Derek’s hand found mine as we walked to the metro station, our steps in sync, the city already humming with movement.

On the platform, he squeezed my hand. “So,” he said, tilting his head down at me, “big bad law firm ready for you?”

I smirked. “The question is…am I ready for them?”

He chuckled. “That’s my girl.”

The cart was crowded, but we found a spot near the doors. Business suits, briefcases, the faint buzz of people reciting presentations under their breath. Miami mornings smelled like cologne, coffee, and ambition. It was a small car that alternated between stations. The rail system in downtown Brickell was not at all like it was in New York.

The cart glided into Brickell. There were crowds of people below us as we exited the cart and stepped out into the flow of commuters, the heat already thick in the air.

After a few blocks of walking, we reached two tall skyscrapers that were adjacent to each other.

Derek leaned down, kissed me quick, and nodded toward his building right next to ours. “Go on, Tiny Tornado. Time to make partner before lunch.”

I grinned, swatting his shoulder softly as we kissed one more time before we both went to different buildings.

Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern loomed ahead of me. A forty-story tower of black glass, the letters *SSS* gleaming in silver near the top. My chest tightened as I walked through the revolving doors into the marble lobby. Everything was polished to a mirror shine, including the floors, pillars, and even the elevator doors.

I caught a glimpse of myself again on the smooth surface of the elevator door. Small frame, neat suit, determined eyes. The elevator ride was silent, the kind where everyone stares at the floor numbers because looking at each other feels like trespassing.

When the doors slid open on the associates’ floor, she was already waiting. Her voice was smooth, clipped, practiced. A woman in her mid-forties stood there, hair hanging loosely past her shoulders, pearl necklace, and a navy suit that probably cost more than my car.

“Jackie Delgado?”

She was Marsha Dawes, one of the firm’s partners. I’d read about her. Ruthless litigator. Built her reputation eating opposing counsel alive in depositions.

“Yes, that’s me.” I said, forcing a smile and extending my hand.

She shook it briefly, her grip cool and precise as a light smile tugged at her lips. “Welcome to Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern. We’ve been expecting you.”

Her eyes lingered on me, like she was sizing me up for something far more than my résumé.

And in that moment, standing in the polished hall of one of the most prestigious white shoe firms in Miami, I swear something shifted. The way she smiled—it wasn’t warm, it wasn’t welcoming.

It was knowing.

Like she already had plans for me.

“Come this way,” Ms. Dawes said, pivoting on her heels with military precision. Jackie fell into step beside her, heels clicking against the immaculate marble floor.

We moved through a maze of hushed hallways lined with closed office doors. The carpet swallowed sound, the kind of luxury flooring meant to make clients feel as though their secrets were safe here, trapped inside a impenetrable vault, or a marble polished coffin.

Every wall was adorned with carefully chosen artwork, ranging from abstract canvases to impressionist pieces that seemed both meaningless yet expensive. The silence was dense, broken only by the occasional muted phone call or the faint shuffle of papers behind closed doors.

“We’ll get you set up with your office and introduce you to some of the team.” Ms. Dawes said, her voice calm, clipped, yet slightly chipper. She walked with her hands clasped lightly in front of her, posture flawless.

I nodded, trying to keep my own steps steady. The sheer scale of the place was daunting, but there was something exhilarating about it too. This was *it*—everything I worked toward all my life.

As they walked, Ms. Dawes added, “Just listen, learn, and don’t be afraid to ask questions. Everyone here was once in your shoes.” She glanced sideways at me with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “And remember, Ms. Delgado, the letter you received from Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern was the only one we sent out this year. We wanted you.”

I blinked. The only one? She opened her mouth to respond, but before she could, Ms. Dawes continued, her voice a notch lower.

“Have you selected the vehicle yet? It’s all part of the onboarding package.”

I tilted my head. “The… vehicle?”

“Yes.” Ms. Dawes said matter-of-factly, as if she were asking whether Jackie had picked out her desk chair. “Most associates choose the firm’s standard issue—this year we’ve partnered with Mercedes. The EQE sedan, electric, top of the line.” Her lips split into a wide, toothy smile. “The Mercedes is just one of the many perks you’ll have. You’ll want to look into the options by the end of the week.”

I was lightheaded. A car? Just handed to me like another piece of office equipment? It seemed surreal. That should have been a glaring red flag. But I was blinded by the casual nonchalant tone inn Marsha’s voice as the rational part of my brain dulled the reptilian side. It was a white shoe firm, so it wasn’t too uncommon.

Right?

“Of course. Thank you. I’ll look into it.”

“Good,” Ms. Dawes replied, her heels clicking a beat faster.

We stopped in front of a door with a gleaming silver plaque. My heart stuttered when she read the engraving:

**Jackie Delgado, Associate**

My name. On an office door. This felt so unreal. Between the Mercedes, my own office, and the starting salary of two hundred and fifty grand, this had to be a fever dream.

Oh how I wish it WAS a fever dream.

Ms. Dawes opened it with a small flourish, stepping aside to let Jackie in. The room was bright, modern, and absurdly spacious compared to the cramped student lounges and libraries she’d lived in for years. Floor-to-ceiling windows stretched across one wall, revealing a stunning view of the Brickell skyline. The sunlight poured in, bouncing off glass towers, the Miami River below glinting like a ribbon of light.

“Welcome to your new domain,” Ms. Dawes said, allowing the faintest curl of a smile to appear on her lips. “I’ll leave you to get settled. My door is always open if you need anything.”

I nodded, unable to find my voice, but Ms. Dawes was already striding down the hallway, her figure disappearing around the corner.

My first real office. Not a borrowed cubicle. Not a library desk. *My office.* A tangible symbol of years of sweat, sacrifice, and relentless drive.

I set my bag on the sleek white desk and walked to the window. From here I had a scenic view of the docks and the Biscayne Bay, our condo standing proudly against the horizon. I walked over to the glass, taking in the view. It was incredible.

The hushed atmosphere of the firm. The expensive artwork in the hallways. The quiet efficiency of the staff. The air smelled faintly of citrus polish and money. Everything here spoke of power, prestige, permanence.

I lowered myself into the plush leather chair behind the desk, the seat enveloping her as though it had been waiting for her all along. My gaze swept the room—the empty shelves, the spotless desk, the waiting phone.

Why, WHY didn’t I notice the red flags? Why didn’t I take my grandfather’s advice?

I remembered my graduation from the University of Miami, the day I received my JD. Her family in the stands, faces glowing with pride. My father crying happy tears. My sister waving furiously, snapping photo after photo.

And her grandfather.

He had clapped politely, even smiled for the pictures, but his eyes had been… skeptical. Distant. As if he knew something the rest of them didn’t.

“You’re too good for places like that,” he’d whispered when they hugged. “You think they want you, Jackie. They don’t want you. They want what you’ll give up for them. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.”

I had brushed it off at the time. Old man nerves. Overprotective worry.

But now, sitting in her pristine office with her name on the door, the memory tugged at my chest like a loose thread.

For the rest of that month, my life felt like a dream.

Work was steady, even exciting. Derek and I slipped into a routine: waking together, coffee on the balcony, splitting off into the Brickell crowds, meeting again on the train home. At night, we cooked together or went out with friends, laughing too loud in bars that overlooked the water.

At the firm, I was fed the kind of work every first-year associate gets: client memos, research assignments, and document review. None of it glamorous, but none of it sinister either.

At least, not at first.

“Okay, ladies, which one of you is ordering the second bottle?” Daniela asked, twirling her wine glass in the Brickell café where we always met for lunch.

“I’ve got depositions this afternoon.” Sophie groaned, shoving her salad aside. “If I show up tipsy, Dawes will have my head.”

Alexa smirked. “Please. Dawes probably downs two martinis before breakfast.”

I chuckled, shaking my head. “Don’t let her hear you say that. I swear the walls in that place have ears.”

“She that bad?” Daniela asked.

“No,” I admitted. “Honestly, she’s been… helpful. I think she likes me.” I said managing a light smile.

“Of course she does.” Sophie said, raising her glass in a mock toast. “Top of your class, volleyball star, law review golden girl. What’s not to like?”

Alexa leaned in. “I bet it’s Derek. Six-three, investment banker, looks like he walked out of a cologne ad. She probably thinks if she treats you right, you’ll bring him to the Christmas party.”

I rolled my eyes, laughing. “You’re terrible.”

“That’s why you love me, Jackie girl!” Alexa grinned.

The four of us talked about everything from weddings, to work, and Netflix shows. It was all so normal I almost forgot I was still the new girl at the most intimidating firm in Miami. Or that i felt something festering below the surface of my senses.

Almost.

That night, back in my office, I opened another file from Ms. Dawes. It was a standard-looking client binder: trust documents, contracts, corporate registrations, financial statements, and even tax returns.

But the tax ID number had an extra digit. thirteen numbers where there should have been nine.

At first I thought it was a typo. But when I keyed it into the firm’s system, the entry resolved into a real profile: a hedge fund registered out of…

… *nowhere*. *Yet somewhere.*

The jurisdiction zip code did not match anything I’d seen. Not offshore havens like the Caymans or Luxembourg. Nothing I could trace. It was just a string of symbols that looked almost mathematical.

No. Mathematical is an understatement. It looked… **mythical.**

I looked up from my screen and closed the file, forcing myself to breathe. It was probably some internal coding system.

The next morning, I found another file. This one looked like a normal investment portfolio. Except the timestamps on the trades were wrong. Yet, they weren’t. I checked the client bank records and deposition notes.

***They were all recorded. And they confirmed everything I read.***

An account had invested in a defense contractor ***the day before*** they announced a massive government contract. They bought options in a tech company ***hours before*** the CEO’s scandal tanked the stock.

I stared at the dates, the hours, the precision of it. It wasn’t luck. It wasn’t even insider trading. It was impossible.

“Everything okay in there?” Daniela’s voice came through the door, startling me.

I snapped the folder shut. “Yeah! Just buried in paper.”

“Welcome to the rest of your life!” she called back, and I could hear her laughing as she walked down the hall.

Later that week, Dawes dropped another file onto my desk herself.

“Preliminary review,” she said crisply. “Flag anything unusual.”

“Of course.” I smiled weakly, pretending that I DIDN’T read what I read or saw what I saw on those hearing and deposition notes.

She started to walk away, then paused. “Don’t overthink anything. Half the work we do is making the impossible look routine.”

I forced a smile. “Understood.”

When I opened the file, I nearly laughed. It was an account ledger for a small religious foundation. But the foundation’s charter dated back further than any I’d seen—so far back it couldn’t be real.

And this was when my instincts stopped whispering and ***began to scream.***

Clay tablets, Babylonian cuneiform, scanned into the file. The entity had supposedly “merged” with three different cults over the centuries. They each had their own god, each absorbed seamlessly into the “modern foundation.”

The current directors had names I didn’t recognize, except one. A professor I’d read about in undergrad anthropology. Only he’d been declared missing in 1997.

But the signature on the audit line looked fresh.

I checked the deposition and hearing letters once more. And my heart fell in my chest upon seeing that said clients ***existed.***  

I sat back in my chair, pressing my fingers to my temples.

“What the hell?” I whispered silently to myself. “Is this supposed to be a prank?”

I wanted to ask Marsha about it. But she was out that evening. She had to meet a client.

At lunch that Friday, Sophie was venting about a partner’s demands.

“I swear, they think we’re robots,” she said. “Do you know what it’s like to proof three hundred pages of contracts in six hours?”

“Sounds like Tuesday.” Alexa muttered.

I sipped my iced tea, smiling faintly, though my mind wasn’t in the conversation. I was increasingly unsettled by the files I kept working on. I kept thinking about the numbers in those files, the way they didn’t add up but still somehow… resolved.

Or about the zip codes to locations that seemingly didn’t exist in any physical space. Or about the hearing logs and litigation reports filed with the clerk of courts that proved the existence of clients that were shadowy organizations.

“You’re quiet,” Daniela said suddenly.

I blinked. “Just tired. Long week.”

Derek texted me later: *Dinner at eight. Wear that red dress I like.*

I smiled, typing back, *Always.*

I didn’t tell him about the file with the trades, or the cult, or the tax IDs that mapped to places I couldn’t find. I wanted to believe it was a prank. A mean, cruel hazing ritual my sorority liked to pull with the freshmen.

But that cold feeling settled into my gut. A feeling of mounting dread that raised the pitch in the voice of my instincts higher and higher as I did more legal work.

Each file felt like a pebble dropped into water, ripples spreading quietly, invisibly, until you realized the whole surface had shifted. And by the end of that first month, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was no longer looking at my work.

My cheeks burned instantly. He always did that, slipping in that pet name that made me sound both ridiculous and invincible. “Don’t call me that,” I muttered.

“Why not?” His reflection grinned back at me. “You’re five-one, Jackie. You whirl into people’s lives, knock them off their feet, and spin right out before they know what hit them. You’re my little tornado. And today? You’re about to tear through Brickell.”

I swatted him in the chest, laughing despite myself. “You’re so cheesy.”

“Cheesy gets results.” he said, and bent to kiss me.

On the dresser behind us sat our engagement photo album, spread open to a photo of us under an arch of white roses. It was a public proposal at a private gala. My parents were beaming, and my baby cousin was throwing petals. Derek held me like the world was his to keep. For that moment, I let myself breathe it in. My life was so perfect back then.

Had I known about the secrets that Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern were keeping?

I would have walked out of that penthouse and taken the first plane to Antarctica.

“Come on,” Derek said, slipping his watch onto his wrist. “Train leaves in fifteen. Don’t want Miami to think their star recruit is late her first day.”

I playfully hit him as we walked out that door.

And that was probably the last time I saw him, or my life, in such a positive light.

We left our penthouse at seven sharp, the morning sun bouncing off Biscayne Bay, glittering like someone had scattered diamonds across the water. Derek’s hand found mine as we walked to the metro station, our steps in sync, the city already humming with movement.

On the platform, he squeezed my hand. “So,” he said, tilting his head down at me, “big bad law firm ready for you?”

I smirked. “The question is…am I ready for them?”

He chuckled. “That’s my girl.”

The cart was crowded, but we found a spot near the doors. Business suits, briefcases, the faint buzz of people reciting presentations under their breath. Miami mornings smelled like cologne, coffee, and ambition. It was a small car that alternated between stations. The rail system in downtown Brickell was not at all like it was in New York.

The cart glided into Brickell. There were crowds of people below us as we exited the cart and stepped out into the flow of commuters, the heat already thick in the air.

After a few blocks of walking, we reached two tall skyscrapers that were adjacent to each other.

Derek leaned down, kissed me quick, and nodded toward his building right next to ours. “Go on, Tiny Tornado. Time to make partner before lunch.”

I grinned, swatting his shoulder softly as we kissed one more time before we both went to different buildings.

Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern loomed ahead of me. A forty-story tower of black glass, the letters *SSS* gleaming in silver near the top. My chest tightened as I walked through the revolving doors into the marble lobby. Everything was polished to a mirror shine, including the floors, pillars, and even the elevator doors.

I caught a glimpse of myself again on the smooth surface of the elevator door. Small frame, neat suit, determined eyes. The elevator ride was silent, the kind where everyone stares at the floor numbers because looking at each other feels like trespassing.

When the doors slid open on the associates’ floor, she was already waiting. Her voice was smooth, clipped, practiced. A woman in her mid-forties stood there, hair hanging loosely past her shoulders, pearl necklace, and a navy suit that probably cost more than my car.

“Jackie Delgado?”

She was Marsha Dawes, one of the firm’s partners. I’d read about her. Ruthless litigator. Built her reputation eating opposing counsel alive in depositions.

“Yes, that’s me.” I said, forcing a smile and extending my hand.

She shook it briefly, her grip cool and precise as a light smile tugged at her lips. “Welcome to Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern. We’ve been expecting you.”

Her eyes lingered on me, like she was sizing me up for something far more than my résumé.

And in that moment, standing in the polished hall of one of the most prestigious white shoe firms in Miami, I swear something shifted. The way she smiled—it wasn’t warm, it wasn’t welcoming.

It was knowing.

Like she already had plans for me.

“Come this way,” Ms. Dawes said, pivoting on her heels with military precision. Jackie fell into step beside her, heels clicking against the immaculate marble floor.

We moved through a maze of hushed hallways lined with closed office doors. The carpet swallowed sound, the kind of luxury flooring meant to make clients feel as though their secrets were safe here, trapped inside a impenetrable vault, or a marble polished coffin.

Every wall was adorned with carefully chosen artwork, ranging from abstract canvases to impressionist pieces that seemed both meaningless yet expensive. The silence was dense, broken only by the occasional muted phone call or the faint shuffle of papers behind closed doors.

“We’ll get you set up with your office and introduce you to some of the team.” Ms. Dawes said, her voice calm, clipped, yet slightly chipper. She walked with her hands clasped lightly in front of her, posture flawless.

I nodded, trying to keep my own steps steady. The sheer scale of the place was daunting, but there was something exhilarating about it too. This was *it*—everything I worked toward all my life.

As they walked, Ms. Dawes added, “Just listen, learn, and don’t be afraid to ask questions. Everyone here was once in your shoes.” She glanced sideways at me with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “And remember, Ms. Delgado, the letter you received from Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern was the only one we sent out this year. We wanted you.”

I blinked. The only one? She opened her mouth to respond, but before she could, Ms. Dawes continued, her voice a notch lower.

“Have you selected the vehicle yet? It’s all part of the onboarding package.”

I tilted my head. “The… vehicle?”

“Yes.” Ms. Dawes said matter-of-factly, as if she were asking whether Jackie had picked out her desk chair. “Most associates choose the firm’s standard issue—this year we’ve partnered with Mercedes. The EQE sedan, electric, top of the line.” Her lips split into a wide, toothy smile. “The Mercedes is just one of the many perks you’ll have. You’ll want to look into the options by the end of the week.”

I was lightheaded. A car? Just handed to me like another piece of office equipment? It seemed surreal. That should have been a glaring red flag. But I was blinded by the casual nonchalant tone inn Marsha’s voice as the rational part of my brain dulled the reptilian side. It was a white shoe firm, so it wasn’t too uncommon.

Right?

“Of course. Thank you. I’ll look into it.”

“Good,” Ms. Dawes replied, her heels clicking a beat faster.

We stopped in front of a door with a gleaming silver plaque. My heart stuttered when she read the engraving:

**Jackie Delgado, Associate**

My name. On an office door. This felt so unreal. Between the Mercedes, my own office, and the starting salary of two hundred and fifty grand, this had to be a fever dream.

Oh how I wish it WAS a fever dream.

Ms. Dawes opened it with a small flourish, stepping aside to let Jackie in. The room was bright, modern, and absurdly spacious compared to the cramped student lounges and libraries she’d lived in for years. Floor-to-ceiling windows stretched across one wall, revealing a stunning view of the Brickell skyline. The sunlight poured in, bouncing off glass towers, the Miami River below glinting like a ribbon of light.

“Welcome to your new domain,” Ms. Dawes said, allowing the faintest curl of a smile to appear on her lips. “I’ll leave you to get settled. My door is always open if you need anything.”

I nodded, unable to find my voice, but Ms. Dawes was already striding down the hallway, her figure disappearing around the corner.

My first real office. Not a borrowed cubicle. Not a library desk. *My office.* A tangible symbol of years of sweat, sacrifice, and relentless drive.

I set my bag on the sleek white desk and walked to the window. From here I had a scenic view of the docks and the Biscayne Bay, our condo standing proudly against the horizon. I walked over to the glass, taking in the view. It was incredible.

The hushed atmosphere of the firm. The expensive artwork in the hallways. The quiet efficiency of the staff. The air smelled faintly of citrus polish and money. Everything here spoke of power, prestige, permanence.

I lowered myself into the plush leather chair behind the desk, the seat enveloping her as though it had been waiting for her all along. My gaze swept the room—the empty shelves, the spotless desk, the waiting phone.

Why, WHY didn’t I notice the red flags? Why didn’t I take my grandfather’s advice?

I remembered my graduation from the University of Miami, the day I received my JD. Her family in the stands, faces glowing with pride. My father crying happy tears. My sister waving furiously, snapping photo after photo.

And her grandfather.

He had clapped politely, even smiled for the pictures, but his eyes had been… skeptical. Distant. As if he knew something the rest of them didn’t.

“You’re too good for places like that,” he’d whispered when they hugged. “You think they want you, Jackie. They don’t want you. They want what you’ll give up for them. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.”

I had brushed it off at the time. Old man nerves. Overprotective worry.

But now, sitting in her pristine office with her name on the door, the memory tugged at my chest like a loose thread.

For the rest of that month, my life felt like a dream.

Work was steady, even exciting. Derek and I slipped into a routine: waking together, coffee on the balcony, splitting off into the Brickell crowds, meeting again on the train home. At night, we cooked together or went out with friends, laughing too loud in bars that overlooked the water.

At the firm, I was fed the kind of work every first-year associate gets: client memos, research assignments, and document review. None of it glamorous, but none of it sinister either.

At least, not at first.

“Okay, ladies, which one of you is ordering the second bottle?” Daniela asked, twirling her wine glass in the Brickell café where we always met for lunch.

“I’ve got depositions this afternoon.” Sophie groaned, shoving her salad aside. “If I show up tipsy, Dawes will have my head.”

Alexa smirked. “Please. Dawes probably downs two martinis before breakfast.”

I chuckled, shaking my head. “Don’t let her hear you say that. I swear the walls in that place have ears.”

“She that bad?” Daniela asked.

“No,” I admitted. “Honestly, she’s been… helpful. I think she likes me.” I said managing a light smile.

“Of course she does.” Sophie said, raising her glass in a mock toast. “Top of your class, volleyball star, law review golden girl. What’s not to like?”

Alexa leaned in. “I bet it’s Derek. Six-three, investment banker, looks like he walked out of a cologne ad. She probably thinks if she treats you right, you’ll bring him to the Christmas party.”

I rolled my eyes, laughing. “You’re terrible.”

“That’s why you love me, Jackie girl!” Alexa grinned.

The four of us talked about everything from weddings, to work, and Netflix shows. It was all so normal I almost forgot I was still the new girl at the most intimidating firm in Miami. Or that i felt something festering below the surface of my senses.

Almost.

That night, back in my office, I opened another file from Ms. Dawes. It was a standard-looking client binder: trust documents, contracts, corporate registrations, financial statements, and even tax returns.

But the tax ID number had an extra digit. thirteen numbers where there should have been nine.

At first I thought it was a typo. But when I keyed it into the firm’s system, the entry resolved into a real profile: a hedge fund registered out of…

… *nowhere*. *Yet somewhere.*

The jurisdiction zip code did not match anything I’d seen. Not offshore havens like the Caymans or Luxembourg. Nothing I could trace. It was just a string of symbols that looked almost mathematical.

No. Mathematical is an understatement. It looked… **mythical.**

I looked up from my screen and closed the file, forcing myself to breathe. It was probably some internal coding system.

The next morning, I found another file. This one looked like a normal investment portfolio. Except the timestamps on the trades were wrong. Yet, they weren’t. I checked the client bank records and deposition notes.

***They were all recorded. And they confirmed everything I read.***

An account had invested in a defense contractor ***the day before*** they announced a massive government contract. They bought options in a tech company ***hours before*** the CEO’s scandal tanked the stock.

I stared at the dates, the hours, the precision of it. It wasn’t luck. It wasn’t even insider trading. It was impossible.

“Everything okay in there?” Daniela’s voice came through the door, startling me.

I snapped the folder shut. “Yeah! Just buried in paper.”

“Welcome to the rest of your life!” she called back, and I could hear her laughing as she walked down the hall.

Later that week, Dawes dropped another file onto my desk herself.

“Preliminary review,” she said crisply. “Flag anything unusual.”

“Of course.” I smiled weakly, pretending that I DIDN’T read what I read or saw what I saw on those hearing and deposition notes.

She started to walk away, then paused. “Don’t overthink anything. Half the work we do is making the impossible look routine.”

I forced a smile. “Understood.”

When I opened the file, I nearly laughed. It was an account ledger for a small religious foundation. But the foundation’s charter dated back further than any I’d seen—so far back it couldn’t be real.

And this was when my instincts stopped whispering and ***began to scream.***

Clay tablets, Babylonian cuneiform, scanned into the file. The entity had supposedly “merged” with three different cults over the centuries. They each had their own god, each absorbed seamlessly into the “modern foundation.”

The current directors had names I didn’t recognize, except one. A professor I’d read about in undergrad anthropology. Only he’d been declared missing in 1997.

But the signature on the audit line looked fresh.

I checked the deposition and hearing letters once more. And my heart fell in my chest upon seeing that said clients ***existed.***  

I sat back in my chair, pressing my fingers to my temples.

“What the hell?” I whispered silently to myself. “Is this supposed to be a prank?”

I wanted to ask Marsha about it. But she was out that evening. She had to meet a client.

At lunch that Friday, Sophie was venting about a partner’s demands.

“I swear, they think we’re robots,” she said. “Do you know what it’s like to proof three hundred pages of contracts in six hours?”

“Sounds like Tuesday.” Alexa muttered.

I sipped my iced tea, smiling faintly, though my mind wasn’t in the conversation. I was increasingly unsettled by the files I kept working on. I kept thinking about the numbers in those files, the way they didn’t add up but still somehow… resolved.

Or about the zip codes to locations that seemingly didn’t exist in any physical space. Or about the hearing logs and litigation reports filed with the clerk of courts that proved the existence of clients that were shadowy organizations.

“You’re quiet,” Daniela said suddenly.

I blinked. “Just tired. Long week.”

Derek texted me later: *Dinner at eight. Wear that red dress I like.*

I smiled, typing back, *Always.*

I didn’t tell him about the file with the trades, or the cult, or the tax IDs that mapped to places I couldn’t find. I wanted to believe it was a prank. A mean, cruel hazing ritual my sorority liked to pull with the freshmen.

But that cold feeling settled into my gut. A feeling of mounting dread that raised the pitch in the voice of my instincts higher and higher as I did more legal work.

Each file felt like a pebble dropped into water, ripples spreading quietly, invisibly, until you realized the whole surface had shifted. And by the end of that first month, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was no longer looking at my work.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I'm grateful that I don't have to work full time and I get more time with my kids. Every single week day I help my daughter get ready for school.make sure everything is ready and good to go. I make sure my husband's lunch is packed and his coffee is made. I take both kids to her sports so he has some alone time after a long days of work. I do all I house chores plus I'll burn papers when I can so he doesn't have to. My daughter gets home from school we sit down and we work on her weekly vocabulary, spelling etc. Anything she needs to work on, I help her. I make every dinner. Every lunch for the kids and breakfast on the days that I'm off. I do all the cleaning, the laundry, grocery shopping,birthday parties, Christmas, 
 all appointments etc. I play with our son all day too. When he does get home our son is all over him.he doesnt mind however My husband you can tell is annoyed that he's not getting any alone time. Which i understand. He doesn't really get much at all.  I don't complain when he doesn't pick after himself. I don't complain when I come home to a messy house and he was at home all day without the kids and didn't lift a finger. I don't care because of him I can be home more often. I appreciate everything about him but idk if he appreciates me? 

All I expect of him is to go to work and out door labor, which he thoroughly enjoys and wants to do. Now he will occasionally clean up or do some chores that I'm grateful for. 

So into it here, I feel like my husband thinks I do nothing right. Least that's how I feel. I put our son to bed. He fought me brushing his teeth. He wanted to just get into bed. I finally lifted him up and put him in the crib. He was smacking and screaming bloody murder. I just put him in the crib told him I love him and good night. My husband immediately went, ""He's going to be doing that forever don't you think? I told him ""no, he was smacking me in the face (just because he was very tired and a toddler). He just went on how I just gave up and put him down. He fell asleep withing 2 minutes. 

He states everything I don't do right but it's very rare for him to tell me what I do, do. Not just that,  but with everything it's always what I did wrong. I don't think he'd being malicious,  but it sucks. It hurts. Anyone else go through this?",1,1758507479.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Everyone else finishes showers, changes, and other tasks by 2:50, sometimes way earlier. I am still scrambling until 3:30 or even 3:40. By around 2, most of the other CNAs are already in the dining room on their phones waiting to clock out instead of dealing with their residents’ call lights. The strange thing is that I do not think I am working slower than anyone else. I am still taking care of my residents.

The difference is that I do more than just my assignment. I answer call lights even if they are not my patients since nobody else does. When I first started, I noticed call lights could stay on for hours with no one checking, so I began helping random patients to the bathroom. I also take extra time to clean and prep my residents properly, and I will grab little things like coffee if someone asks, or get them a new brief. On top of that, I help other CNAs when they ask me for assistance. Because of this, all the residents on my floor really like and respect me.

Sometimes the nurse throws extra work at me, like when I had to do 1 on 1 with one of the patient, she told me to feed them instead of the person who had her, or had me deal with dining instead of the person who is listed, etc.

Management is frustrated because my assigned tasks are not wrapped up “on time.” It feels like I am being punished for going the extra mile. They even assumed I needed extra help or did not know what I was doing, so they put me on a second orientation with another CNA for the week. That honestly felt disrespectful.

i believe that i (20F) am being stalked/harassed by my ex-coworker/hookup (who i’ll call matt) who is 27M. i am also in texas if that helps.

i met matt in december 2024 when i was 19 and started working at my current coffee giant barista job. this is not the first time i have worked for this company so i am familiar with their policies. when i first started at my store, i was in an incredibly abusive relationship, and matt, who was my shift supervisor at the time and i became fast friends outside of work. matt was also in a relationship at the time. i eventually opened up to matt and a couple other coworkers about my situation. matt then became extremely close to me and was my strongest support system when i left my ex and i was his, as his relationship had ended in january of this year.

matt and i eventually started hooking up when i moved out of my ex’s place and in with my coworker temporarily. i made it very clear to him that i did not want nor was i even close to being ready to date. he claimed that he understood.

eventually, i moved into my current apartment with my roommate anna (fake name) who was also friends with matt. we messed around from april-late july of this year before i eventually ended things due to some concerns, like irrational jealousy on his end and him trying to pressure me into a relationship (he told me that he loved me two weeks into us hooking up). when i ended things, he admitted to me that he had been gunning for me since before him and his ex broke up in january. after this, i made it clear to him that i only wanted him to contact me if it was work related and that i wanted everything to be civil. i blocked him on social media and left his number unblocked. i also let my store manager know about the situation, just to cover my own ass.

then came the texts. i have over 45 screenshots of him texting me either begging for me back or being extremely angry at me. he then started messaging every single person he knew i was close with at work, asking for information about me, all of which i have screenshots of. matt then started showing up at the store when he knew i was working under the premise of getting drinks. he would go into the back and talk to our coworkers for up to half an hour, which made me extremely uncomfortable. going into the back of house when you are not scheduled is also against our company’s policy. he then asked me for my work schedule, which i refused to give to him. one of my other coworkers eventually reported him to our store manager for doing this, and him and three other employees had to write statements on the matter.

matt ended up transferring stores and i eventually had to block his number. i thought everything would be over. 
he is still showing up at my store when i am there, despite knowing what my car looks like and seeing it in the parking lot. he is still questioning mutual friends about me. it has gotten so bad that he has found my roommate’s boyfriend and the person i am seeing now’s instagrams. he is actively watching the person i am seeing now’s instagram story every time he posts.

matt also told a different coworker that me and my roommate had to report for sexual harassment that we were the ones who reported him. this could jeopardize my safety, as that coworker has just received a final written warning and he knows it is my fault.

there’s a lot more detail i left out and this is a novel. i have evidence of practically everything i mentioned above. i just want to know if filing a police report is necessary or will even accomplish anything. thank y’all so much.

TLDR: my old coworker/hookup is lowkey stalking me and i want to know if i should go to the police",2,1758507163.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1nnab10,https://i.redd.it/t5bmh6sfjmqf1.png,"Echoes of a Silent Love | Three years ago, my uncle Benson Gambrell lured me into giving him my first time.","Chapter 1

Three years ago, my uncle Benson Gambrell lured me into giving him my first time.

He spoiled me, making me the most envied girl of New York—the darling everyone whispered about.

I truly believed he would announce our relationship at the Gambrells' New Year's banquet.

Instead, he poured me drink after drink until my head spun... and handed me off like a party favor to a notorious playboy.

I ran away in tears to confront him, only to overhear him talking with his buddy.

""You're really willing to let her go?""

He had his arm around his beloved crush, a careless smile playing on his lips.

""She's just a disobedient mute, always clinging to me like a leech. She needs to be taught a lesson.""

But when I walked down the aisle in a wedding dress to marry Mr. Devlin of Boston, Benson completely lost his mind.

\*\*\*

When I stumbled home, clutching the remnants of my torn dress, Benson was at the grand piano with Gianna Rodney.

Sunlight spilled through the windows, painting a picture of elegance and grace—him, handsome and refined; her, poised and beautiful.

Anyone would have called them a perfect match.

My entrance shattered the romantic scene.

Gianna glanced at me, lips curling in a smile that never reached her eyes.

""Cici, why are you just getting home now? And whose jacket is that over your shoulders?""

She walked over slowly and yanked the suit jacket off my shoulders. My dress underneath was shredded, barely covering what it needed to.

She feigned surprise, her voice sweet with false concern. ""What happened to your dress? Did something happen?""

Her words sounded caring, but I couldn't miss the mockery and contempt in her gaze.

The humiliation from last night surged back, raw and painful. Despair and fear seeped into my very bones.

If not for Alexis Devlin, I might not have survived.

I pushed Gianna aside and turned to go upstairs.

I hadn't used much strength, but she stumbled dramatically, collapsing to the floor as if I'd shoved her hard.

She bit her lip, her eyes reddening, playing the victim as though I'd truly hurt her.

I moved to help her up, but in the next instant, someone seized my wrist in a brutal grip.

""What did you do to Gianna? Where are your manners? Didn't I teach you better than this?""

""Apologize!""

Benson glared at me, his voice full of reproach.

His grip on my wrist was so tight it hurt. I looked at him, my heart breaking.

At last night's Gambrell Group New Year's gala, he held Gianna's hand, laughing and chatting as they announced their engagement.

Everyone wished them a lifetime of happiness.

But just before he went on stage, he'd pulled me into a corner, kissed me breathless, and promised to stay by my side forever.

How did everything change so suddenly?

I accidentally knocked over a wine glass, losing my composure for the first time. Hot tears streamed down my face, unstoppable.

I ran off, not caring about anything else.

Benson remained the perfect gentleman, telling everyone I was just drunk.

But I saw it in his eyes—coldness, and a thinly veiled disgust toward me.

Backstage, he had someone hand me a drink and called me up to the hotel's penthouse suite.

I thought he would explain everything, but instead, I found Matthew Rodney waiting for me, his eyes clouded with lust.

Matthew was a major shareholder in the Gambrell Group, Gianna's brother, and infamous for his debauchery.

He seemed possessed, ripping at my clothes no matter how loudly I screamed.

I struggled to get free, but my body felt feverish and weak.

He had drugged the drink.

With the last of my strength, I kicked Matthew away and fled the room, desperate to find Benson and demand an explanation.

I stumbled to Benson's room, only to hear voices through the half-open door.

""You really don't care about your little niece?""

It was Benson's best friend speaking.

Then Benson laughed, low and careless.

""She's just a disobedient mute, always clinging to me like a leech. I raised her this long—she needs to be put in her place.""

""You're ruthless.""

Laughter erupted inside the room.

I jerked my hand back, tears spilling down my cheeks.

I didn't understand.

The uncle I trusted most, the one who swore to protect me for life, had handed me over to someone else.

A sharp ache burned in my nose.

I tore myself free from Benson's grip, my hands shaking as I signed, ""I'm sorry, Gianna.""

Then I bowed deeply to her and went upstairs without looking back.

Chapter 2

I returned to my room, closed the door, and collapsed onto the floor as if all my strength had drained away.

Silently, I flipped through the photo album.

After my parents died in a car accident, the trauma left me mute. None of my relatives wanted to take in a burden like me.

So Benson brought me to the Gambrell family.

I tried my best to please everyone in the Gambrell household, always smiling even when I was wronged.

Late at night, when the house was quiet, I curled up under my blanket and cried in secret.

When Benson found out, he canceled all his work just to stay with me.

Every photo in the album was of Benson and me.

There were pictures of us at amusement parks, him wearing a silly hat just to make me laugh.

There was a shot of us holding hands, facing the ocean, as he shouted, ""I'll protect Cecilia Monroe for the rest of my life!""

When I was sick, he stayed by my side all night, never leaving me alone.

Over time, my feelings for him began to change.

Three years ago, on his 26th birthday, he kissed me while he was drunk. I didn't push him away.

That silent romance lasted three years.

I thought we'd be together forever. But reality hit me hard.

The day he gave me to Matthew as a New Year's gift, I finally woke up.

Tears fell, one after another.

Soon, I'd be leaving this place. After that, the Gambrell family would have nothing to do with me anymore.

I took out a pair of scissors and began cutting up our photos, one by one. Just as I was almost finished, Benson burst through the door.

He saw the scraps scattered across the floor and snatched the scissors from my hand.

""Throwing a tantrum again? Cecilia, you're too old for this.""

I lowered my eyes, refusing to look at him.

Seeing me ignore him, he sighed softly, wrapping his arm around my waist as if he had no other choice.

""Gia said you got hurt. Let me see—where is it?""

As he spoke, he started to lift my shirt with practiced ease.

When he saw the bruises on my waist, a flicker of pain crossed his eyes. He reached out and gently touched the wound.

""Does it still hurt?""

If I hadn't heard what he said last night with my own ears, I might have melted into his tenderness.

How could he give me to someone else, allow them to hurt me, and then act as if he cared?

I shoved his hand away and sighed, ""Benson, my injury is nothing. You don't need to worry.""

I was polite, as if speaking to a stranger.

Benson paused, then let out a short laugh.

""Cecilia, stop pretending. It was just a little punishment—do you have to make such a scene?""

A scene? Being handed over to someone else as a gift was just a little punishment?

I stared at Benson, dazed, as if seeing him clearly for the first time. Something inside me shattered without a sound.

""Mr. Gambrell, Ms. Rodney's headaches are acting up again. She needs you right away!"" A housekeeper knocked gently on the door, reminding him.

Benson sprang to his feet and headed out, not sparing me a single glance.

Just before leaving, he turned and fixed me with a cold stare.

""Gia's not well. Don't go bothering her for no reason. If I find out you do...""

He paused.

""You can forget about staying in the Gambrell's residence.""

With that, he slammed the door behind him.

I let out a bitter laugh.

Not anymore, Benson.

I don't want to stay with the Gambrell family—not at all.

Chapter 3

Maybe it was meant as a warning, but Benson insisted I go with him and Gianna to the bridal boutique to pick out a wedding dress.

When we arrived, Benson and Gianna walked in arm-in-arm, their closeness unmistakable.

Gianna whispered something I couldn't hear, and the two of them exchanged a smile—just like a couple deeply in love.

I trailed behind them, my head bowed, feeling like an unwanted third wheel.

Gianna tried on dress after dress, twirling around happily as Benson watched her with indulgent eyes and a gentle smile.

He used to look at me like that.

Once, during a college gym class, I fell and gashed my forehead. I didn't cry while getting stitches at the hospital, but the moment I saw Benson, the tears wouldn't stop.

He patted my back and said, ""Cici, even with a scraped forehead, you'd still make the most beautiful bride.""

Back then, I thought it was his way of confessing his feelings. Now I see it was nothing but wishful thinking on my part.

I let out a bitter laugh and stepped out of the boutique.

Suddenly, I remembered my own wedding with Alexis was fast approaching. I decided to pick out a pair of cufflinks as a gift for him.

If Alexis hadn't come to my rescue that night, Matthew would have ruined me.

After I finished shopping, I quietly returned to the car, only to find Gianna sitting there alone.

She admired her freshly done nails, glancing at me with casual indifference.

""So, Ms. Monroe, how did you enjoy your night with my brother?

""I made sure to warn him not to break you—otherwise your dear uncle would be upset.""

""My brother can be pretty rough, so I hope you can handle it.""

She flashed a cold, mocking smile, her eyes sharp and merciless.

I stared at her, fury and humiliation surging through me, my body trembling uncontrollably.

It was her!

She wanted to destroy me!

I couldn't hold back any longer. I raised my hand and swung at her face.

She shrieked, clutching her cheek, then glanced out the window as tears began to fall.

""Cici, please, I'm begging you—just let me go. I really do love Ben...""

She looked so pitiful, like a delicate white flower.

I froze, my hand suspended in midair.

""Cecilia, what are you doing!?"" Benson's voice thundered with rage.

Before I could react, Benson grabbed my wrist and yanked me out of the car with brutal force.

My knees slammed against the pavement, blood streaming down my legs. Agonizing pain shot through every nerve, and tears flooded my eyes.

""I warned you—don't you dare lay a finger on Gia!""

Benson's face was cold as steel.

I knew he was truly angry now.

Gianna clung to his arm, sweetly pleading on my behalf.

""Cici's still just a kid. It's okay if she hit me...""

""She's just acting out! Gia, you don't need to defend her!""

I desperately signed, trying to tell him Gianna was faking it—but Benson only gazed at her with concern, never sparing me a single glance.

I tried to speak, but my throat felt strangled, and all that came out was a broken, raspy sob.

Finally, Benson turned to me, but his eyes were filled with nothing but disgust.

""What right do you have to cry? Maybe you really do need a lesson to remember.""

His words cut like a dull knife, leaving my heart aching.

Without hesitation, Benson slammed the car door and floored the accelerator, disappearing into the thick darkness of the night.

Winter in New York was bone-chillingly cold.

The wind howled past my ears, leaving nothing but a biting chill and a sense of utter loneliness.

I pulled my coat tighter around me, but I couldn't stop shivering.

Bang! Bang!

With a few sharp bursts, fireworks shot into the silent night sky. The dazzling explosions lit up the darkness, painting the city in brilliant color.

Suddenly, several WhatsApp messages popped up on my phone.

Gianna had sent a handful of photos—shots of her and Benson together. They stood beneath the grand display of fireworks, Benson gently cradling her head as he kissed her.

""Ben set off all the fireworks in the city just for me.""

Not long after, she quickly deleted the messages.

""Sorry, sent those to the wrong person.""

I watched her little performance, just for her own satisfaction.

I placed a hand over my heart. Once, seeing things like this would've hurt. But now, my heart felt numb, quiet—almost peaceful.

""It's fine. Wishing you both a happy marriage.""

Chapter 4

I turned off my phone and was about to keep walking when someone yanked me back by my hair.

""Bitch, you got away last time, but I won't let you get away again!"" Matthew's voice snarled in my ear, like some demon straight out of hell.

In an instant, I was back on that night. The terror clung to me, making my whole body tremble uncontrollably.

He dragged me into a nearby alley. I beat at his hands, but he grew impatient and slapped me hard, over and over.

My cheeks swelled instantly, burning with pain.

""Mr. Gambrell handed you to me—wasn't that so I could have my fun with you?""

Despair widened my eyes.

Benson again?

Did he really hate me this much?

Just before I lost consciousness, I vaguely saw headlights shining up ahead.

And someone was shouting my name.

When I didn't come home for days, word finally reached Benson.

He paused only for a moment before sneering, ""Let her be. If she wants to make trouble, let her. I'm sick of it!""

He didn't care at all—my disappearance meant nothing to him.

Instead, he threw himself into preparing for his wedding with Gianna.

Soon, the day of their signing ceremony arrived.

In the lounge, Gianna—dressed to the nines—was anxiously dialing Matthew's number.

No answer.

""That's impossible...""

She couldn't understand it.

With the Rodney family's influence, backed by the Gambrell Group, getting rid of a mute girl like me should have been effortless.

""Could something have gone wrong?"" she wondered, beads of sweat breaking out along her hairline, her makeup starting to slip.

""What's impossible?"" Benson asked, frowning.

The Gambrell Group, as New York's real estate giant, wielded enormous influence. The city's elite were all in attendance.

As Benson's only adopted niece, I should have been there.

He'd privately asked his assistant to check for any word from me, but there was nothing.

A faint sense of unease crept into him.

Gianna quickly forced a smile, taking Benson's hand.

""It's nothing, Ben. Isn't it time for Cici to come back?""

""She's just a kid at heart, never meant any harm. I forgave her long ago.""

Benson's face darkened.

""No harm? She slapped you, didn't she? That's pure arrogance and malice!

""I must have spoiled her all these years, turned her into someone completely out of control!

""Well, now it's time she learns a hard lesson!""

Gianna wrapped her arms around him, resting her cheek against his chest.

In a soft voice, she said, ""But I kind of miss her, Ben. Why don't you bring her back?""

A flicker of delight crossed Benson's heart, though he kept his expression resigned.

""You're just too kind-hearted.""

He frowned, instructing the butler to fetch me.

With only five minutes left before the ceremony, the butler finally rushed in, sweating and bowing deeply to Benson.

""Mr. Gambrell, Ms. Monroe... she... she..."" He stammered, unable to finish.

Seeing him arrive alone, Benson's frown deepened.

""Why didn't Cecilia come with you? Is she still throwing a tantrum, refusing to apologize?""

Gianna hurried to comfort him. ""Don't be upset, Ben. After everything Cici's been through, it's normal for her to be angry.""

Benson let out a cold laugh, his voice icy. ""She hit you, and she's still in the right?

""Go tell Cecilia that if she doesn't want to come, then she should never come back! Let her die out there for all I care!""

The butler bowed even lower.

""That's not it, Mr. Gambrell. I haven't seen Ms. Monroe at all...""

Benson's face turned black as thunder. He grabbed a teacup from the coffee table and smashed it down with a crash.

""She still refuses to see me? She's really gone too far! What the hell does she want?

""This time, I'll make sure she learns her lesson!""

He started to get up, but the butler hurried to block his way.

Gritting his teeth, the butler finally blurted out, ""Mr. Gambrell... M-Ms. Monroe disappeared five days ago!""

Like, yes, there are ppl who find it sexually appealing ( which is ok, i don’t get why they do. But its still ok )

But sometimes it feels like ppl oversexualized it so much ( and i mean SO MUCH ) to the point that if they see someone who has a bigger chest, they become targeted BADLY

Sir….WHAT????

Like, they dont Even do anything. They would talking abt how they are eating pineapples or just talking about CHEESE. But ppl would go insane abt their chest ( im talking abt social media. I have noticed ppl doing this. Even with other ppls OCs. They would hate on them bc of the characters having a larger chest and then accuse them of fetishizing. The OCs was just drinking coffee btw )

I don’t get why everything is so sexualized.

Feets are sexualized, armpits…SEXUALIZED, and boobs…SEXUALIZED TO THE CORE.

And again, i am not talking abt ppl who find it sexually appealing.

I am talking abt ppl only thinking that boobs are just sexual and sexual ONLY and then shame on others for having a bigger chest bc to them its ‘’ fetishizing ‘’ even though the person was not showing any behaviour of fetishizing bigger chest.

( someone even sexualized a woman BREASTFEEDING THEIR CHILD……ARE YOU KIDDING ME )

Like, dont get me wrong, i do think boobs have an aesthetic appeal. Like in clothes and would fit their shape and all. Or like a renaissance painting.

Heck it could Even be used as pillows! And you can also hear someones heartbeat when lying on them so i don’t mind them.

I just hate how its so oversexualized to the point that ppl don’t see it differently

It makes me go insane bc most ppl are just oversexualizing it so much. Idk if its Even just me tbh

Does anyone relate?

I Hope this post isnt too insensitive. Bc i don’t want it to be. Its just that i have noticed this pattern everywhere and its getting tiring bc of how its so….yk.sexualized.

So yeah, i am very sorry if this post sounded insensitive. Pls let me know if it is so i wont do the same mistake again.

One of my friends (19 M),we can call him Jay, and I (23 F)have been arguing about a situation that has two sides. This one’s going to be a doozy and I apologize for how long this might be. Jay and I became friends exactly 31 days ago. I havnt known Jay for very long. Over the past couple weeks hanging out I have brought him around my close friend group. Let’s name them Sam(26 M), Tom(23 M) and Kris(22 M). I had some incidents with Kris before, making me think that he really does not like woman and he takes it out on me since I’m the only girl in the group. He always tried to throw insults at me but I would always shut them down. I’ve always been honest and there for him from day one. When me and Jay had our first interaction in person, we talked about our past relationships. He mentioned leaving his ex because she cheated on him multiple times, he became controlling, and didn’t like who he was becoming. I didn’t ask for many details and Jay never said anything further about what he meant. Jay said that he needs focus on growing as a person after all that trauma. So who is this girl? Jay told me that June(19 F) is his ex. Which to mine and his surprise, is my cousin. He said he didn’t know that we were related. My close friends always had a weird feeling about Jay from the start. Over time I started to see things in Jays behavior that made me uncomfortable. I did some more digging to find out if I’m the only one who feels this way. After thinking and talking to my close friends about it. I wrote a letter to Jay expressing how me and the others feel. To sum up my letter that I wrote to jay “I need to be honest about how I’ve been feeling. Some of your comments come across as disrespectful or hypocritical, and they’ve started making people uncomfortable—we can’t tell if you’re joking or serious. You often dismiss others, instead of listening, and it makes me not want to open up anymore. At times, you act differently than what you preach, and it feels like you’re creating an image that isn’t real. Others in the group have also noticed this behavior and it’s caused tension. I don’t think it’s a good idea to keep bringing you around.” I then sent it to him. He nick-picked the paragraph without reading it all. Jay wanted to know who exactly have been saying these things about him. I told Jay “All of that and you’re more interested in who said what instead of how I and others felt? Someone’s who’s more interested about who’s saying things is someone who’s not willing to work on themselves.” Jay then said he’s too busy to craft a response and he will talk to me later. We left it at that and the day goes on without me hearing anything from Jay. Later that night, I was hanging out with my close friends. We decided to stop at a gas station and saw that Jay was there. We hung out there for some time away from Jay, then quickly headed out after our coffee. I see Jay is talking to two others that I’m not fairly close with. I got home and still havnt heard anything from Jay. As I’m getting ready for bed, my mom comes into my room and warned me about Jay. I’ve only spoken about Jay once to my mom. Then never again afterwards. My mom came home from hanging out with Junes family. Mom then asked me if I hang out with Jay. I said sometimes. She told me it’s probably best to not bring Jay around. That June was in an abusive relationship with him. He tried to control her about what she wears upon other things. Jay once pushed her into a wall while arguing. That Jay has done a lot of bad things, with June and her mom calling him a psychopath and a stalker. June and her family moved away because Junes mother didn’t want Jay finding out where they live and have a restraining order against Jay. Also Jay knew the entire time that I am Junes cousin. I was shocked. I then quickly went to the gc with my close friends being in the chat. No jay. I told them what just happened, I started ranting on about every detail about my experience. Tom then stated that he knew something was off about Jay from the beginning. With Sam backing him up. Tom then proceeded to say Jay was acting creepy recently and asking what Im gunna do now. I saw Kris popping in and out of the gc but saying nothing. I told them, I’m not sure but there’s always two sides of the story. Sam then said “Abuse and stalking is all i need to hear to be weary of him” I told Sam, “only if this is all true. We don’t know that for sure.” Seconds later while still in talking in the gc, Tom and I receive a text from Jay asking who’s talking bad about him. The only person who was in the gc that would tell Jay what’s going on, is I assumed Kris. I confronted Kris and he admitted to telling Jay the conversation we were having. Telling me that I’m talking bad about Jay. I told him I simply was not talking bad intentionally, I was talking about what happened. I wanted to get some advice from my close friends. I didn’t think Kris would immediately turn his back on me. I was going to confront Jay once I get more of a clear response crafted but Kris ran to Jay before we finished the conversation in the gc. I didn’t have the opportunity to talk to Jay yet. At this point the rest of the group are upset at Kris and Jay. I then got a call from Kris with Jay connected to the call. Accusing me of spreading lies, that “running my mouth to the group before talking to Jay was a shitty thing to do.” I told them I don’t see anything wrong with wanting to talk to them about it first before I say anything to Jay. I was looking for support. They then continued to tell me that I’m being fake, that I’m spreading false info, that June and her mother don’t like me and they are really bad people. Jay was tracking everybody that “might be involved in the gc” that night we ran into him at the gas station. Confronting people if they ever talked bad about him. Not knowing the gc is only just me and my close friends. Which I reminded him who was in the chat. I told Kris again I thought I could trust him. That I was going to talk to Jay but Kris beat me to it. I never said any of this was 100% true. They continued to talk over me to a point where I couldn’t get a word in at all. After hearing them belittle me, disrespect me and my family, I snapped. This is where I might have been the a hole. I told them “please shut the f*ck up and listen to me! You’re not letting me talk at all, where was I?” Kris then said “okay I’m done” then ended the call. I told both of them “do not expect me to respect you after disrespecting me.” It sounds like Jay is trying his best to cover up some things. With Kris being oblivious. Jay never said he didn’t abuse, stalk or did any of these bad things to June. Jay blew up at the fact that there was false info of a restraining order and that “nothings true”. I had enough, I messaged Junes mom myself. She said “everything is true but no restraining order at the moment but I said I will put a restraining order on him if he continues to act the way he was since the reasonings will be justified in court. He honestly is a bad guy, I wouldn’t let him get in your group”. So my mom misheard Junes mom. Thinking they already had it against him. I want to apologize to Jay and tell him that the restraining order is a misunderstanding but I don’t know if I should. Kris and Jay think I’m the ahole for telling, what I thought were my close friends, about the whole incident with what my mom said before talking to Jay first.

The Subtle Art of Letting Go

Have you ever been close to someone, only for them to suddenly ghost you or walk away without giving a reason? Deep down, there’s usually a reason—but they don’t say it. And that silence hurts more than words ever could.

It feels like standing alone in the dark. You reach out, searching for answers, but nothing comes back. The heaviness stays. The truth is, once someone decides to move on, there’s nothing you can do to make them stay.

So, what should be done? Try again? Give them space? Wait? The reality is simple: sometimes, they won’t come back.

There’s a saying: “If you truly love someone, let them go. If they are yours, they will return. If not, they never were.”

You cannot force someone to stay. It’s like gripping sand—the tighter the hold, the faster it slips away.

So let them go. Let the feelings go. Let the darkness, the pain, the heaviness flow away.

This isn’t about giving up or erasing memories. It’s about acceptance. Because holding on is like clutching an anchor. At first, it feels safe—waiting, hoping, believing they might return. But in truth, the anchor only keeps you stuck, while life, like the ocean, keeps flowing.

Yes, it’s hard. At the start, it feels unbearable. But slowly, it gets easier. The weight lightens.

In every story, one stays and one moves on. Waiting forever for someone who will never return isn’t hope—it’s a blind chain. Every wait has an end, and clinging to false hope only leads to more disappointment.

So, let me ask you—yes, you reading this. Maybe you’ve faced this before, maybe you’re facing it now, or maybe not yet. Do you still want them back in your life? Do you still miss them? Actually, I miss them sometimes.

And here’s the harder question: what will you do if they come back? Because truth is, most of the time… they don’t. But even if they did—would it feel the same as before, or would it feel different now? Think about it—the way you remember them then, and the way you see them now.

What would you do if you saw them again?
Would you ask for the reason once more?
Would you simply ignore them?
Or maybe… would you say thank you and sorry?

Why “thank you” and “sorry”?

Thank them for coming into your life. For the good moments. For the memories. For showing you a version of yourself you may not have seen otherwise. In some way, they helped shape who you are now.

Sorry—because maybe, knowingly or unknowingly, you hurt them. Maybe you were part of the reason they left.


Thank them for coming into your life, because maybe they were part of shaping who you are today. Say sorry if you ever hurt them, even unintentionally. And if life gives you that rare second chance to see them again, don’t carry the past like baggage. Carry a smile. Share a coffee. Say thanks, say sorry, and then let life take its course. Closure isn’t always found in answers—it’s found in peace.

So, if you ever cross paths with them again, don’t complicate it. Smile. Maybe share a coffee. Say thanks, say sorry. Simple. If you ask me what I’d do? Exactly that. What about you?”

Finally, I let out a long sigh—only to see his text pop up:



""Sophia's having a rough time. I gave her your ticket.""



""See if you can grab a bus ticket or something. It’s only seven or eight hours anyway.""



I stared at my screen as my confirmed seat flipped to ""CANCELED.""



After a beat of silence, I dialed:



""Hey Dad? Can our private jet just land at my campus entrance?""





Chapter 1





Right before Thanksgiving, I pulled three all-nighters to snag train tickets home with my boyfriend, Aaron Ruthven.





Finally, I let out a long sigh—only to see his text pop up:





""Sophia's having a rough time. I gave her your ticket.""





""See if you can grab a bus ticket or something. It’s only seven or eight hours anyway.""





I stared at my screen as my confirmed seat flipped to ""CANCELED.""





After a beat of silence, I dialed:





""Hey Dad? Can our private jet just land at my campus entrance?""





There was a two-second pause on the other end.





Dad was obviously thrown by my sudden and very over-the-top request.





But he knows me. I'm not the type to throw tantrums over nothing.





""Of course,"" he said without asking any questions.





""Thanks, Dad.""





""Of course, honey. We'll talk when you get home.""





The second I hung up, Aaron was calling.





""Rachel! What the hell? Why are you ignoring my texts?""





His voice was loaded with irritation and accusation.





""It's just a stupid ticket. Are you seriously gonna be this dramatic? Sophia's having a rough time - can't you show some compassion?""





I gripped my phone so tight my knuckles went white.





""MY ticket. You just canceled it without even asking me?""





""It was an emergency!""





Aaron's tone got even more self-righteous.





""Sophia failed her exam and has been feeling really down. The first-class seat you booked is quiet and spacious - perfect for her to relax on the ride home.""





""Plus, why didn't you book three tickets anyway? Now we're stuck dealing with this whole mess!""





His logic was so twisted I almost laughed.





""Aaron, I spent three sleepless nights staring at the screen, my fingers sore, just to snag us those two tickets.""





""I thought this was going to be our first trip home together - something special to remember. And you didn't even give my seat to that bitch without even asking me?!""





""What's that supposed to mean?""





His voice got louder, more aggressive.





""Rachel, when did you become so cold and petty?""





""Sophia's your friend too! She's all alone at school, thousands of miles from home. Shouldn't we be looking out for her? Why are you being so selfish about one ticket?""





""Alone?""

I repeated the word softly, feeling something cold settle in my chest.

""She's struggling, but I'm not? You want me to stand for eight hours and you don't give a damn how I feel?""

""Standing room, so what? It's a little uncomfortable - big deal. Since when are you such a princess?""

Aaron's voice dripped with disappointment

""I thought you were kind and understanding. Turns out you're just shallow as hell! Getting this worked up just because it's not first-class seat anymore? Making everyone miserable over your bruised ego?""

Listening to him talk, all I could feel was the bitter irony.

Shallow? Me? Over a train ticket

He had no clue that I didn't give a damn about the ticket itself. I just wanted to go home together, to have that journey side by side.

If I wanted, forget one ticket - Dad could buy the entire train with a single phone call.

But I was done explaining.

I just wanted to see what other pathetic little drama he and his precious princess could put on.

My silence stretched for a few seconds, which Aaron clearly took as guilt and surrender.

His tone softened slightly, but still carried that patronizing edge.

""Okay, okay, quit being dramatic. I get it - you're upset. I'll take you to a movie when we get back to make up for it, alright?""

""Just see if you can snag a coach ticket or something. Sophia and I will meet you at the station when you get in.""

I could practically picture his face right now - that smug look like he thought he was being so generous and understanding.

""Don't bother,"" I said flatly.

""Don't bother with what? What do you mean?"" Aaron sounded confused.

""I mean keep your tickets. I'll figure out my own way home. Don't worry about it.""

My voice was completely calm, emotionless.

""Rachel! Are you serious?""

Aaron's irritation flared up again.

""Can you stop acting like a bratty kid? How are you gonna 'figure it out'? You can't get tickets anywhere, so what - you gonna fly home or something?""

Chapter 2

Fly? I almost smiled coldly.

Yeah, actually. That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

I took a deep breath to keep my voice steady:

""I mean I'll handle it myself. Just take care of your Sophia.""

Hearing that I seemed to give in, Aaron's tone finally shifted - now he sounded satisfied, almost smug.

""There's my good girl. Stop being silly.""

""So get on finding that ticket, yeah? Standing room isn't gonna kill you - quit being such a drama queen.""

""I gotta go get Sophia some food. She cried all night, her eyes are totally swollen.""

""Okay.""

I didn't want to say another word.

""Alright then, I'm hanging up. Talk later.""

He rushed through the goodbye and ended the call.

I calmly started packing my stuff for the Thanksgiving break.

I'd just zipped up my small suitcase when my phone started buzzing again.

Aaron. Again.

I raised an eyebrow and answered without saying anything.

""Rachel.""

His voice sounded way more relaxed than before.

""Whatcha doing? Any luck with tickets yet?""

""Haven't checked,"" I said curtly.

He paused - clearly my coldness caught him off guard.

But he bounced back quickly and kept talking: ""Oh... no big deal, plenty of time. So, um... Sophia woke up for a bit and when she heard about your ticket getting canceled, she felt really terrible about it. She wants to bring you some gift from home to say thanks...""

I stayed silent, waiting for the real agenda.

There was no way Sophia was being that thoughtful.

Sure enough, Aaron switched gears.

""Actually, um, Rachel, there's one more thing...""

""You know how crazy the library gets after breaks - all the good study spots get taken immediately. And since you'll probably... you know, get home and not have much going on...""

He was stumbling over his words: ""Maybe... could you come back a couple days early and save some seats for Sophia and me? We're planning to study together when we get back...""

I couldn't help but laugh bitterly.

Beginning of freshman year, I'd shown up at Aaron's dorm with a fresh notebook and his favorite coffee.

""I heard the window seats on the library's top floor have this amazing view of campus - especially pretty in fall.""

I'd looked up at him with bright, hopeful eyes: ""Want to go claim a spot tomorrow and study together?""

Aaron had frowned and pushed away the coffee I'd brought him: ""Come on, Rachel. The library's so far - it's like a twenty-minute walk. I'd rather just study in my dorm.""

And now he wanted me - the person whose ticket they'd stolen, who might have to stand for eight hours on a crowded train - to come back to campus early and save library seats for him and Sophia?

My silence seemed to make Aaron think I was hesitating or maybe agreeing.

""See, this way you won't be bored sitting at home doing nothing, and you're helping us out - total win-win, right?""

""Sophia's gonna be so grateful when she finds out. If she's in a better headspace, she'll totally ace her next exams.""

I swallowed down the wave of nausea rising in my throat.

If I blew up at him now, I'd miss out on whatever amazing performance they had lined up next.

I deliberately lowered my voice: ""...Fine. Got it. You guys... have fun.""

Hearing me cave again, Aaron's tone turned completely cheerful, like he'd just solved some major inconvenience.

""Now that's more like it! Rachel, you're seriously the best - so understanding.""

""Alright, so we're all set! I'm counting on you for those seats. Try to get the ones by the windows with good airflow - Sophia likes those.""

""When I get back, I'll take you to that restaurant you've been wanting to try.""

He even had the nerve to give me specific seating requirements.

""Mm."" I made a noncommittal sound.

""Sweet, gotta go - Sophia's calling me over for something.""

He couldn't hang up fast enough.

Chapter 3

The dial tone buzzed and I finally dropped the fake act.

The next two days were dead quiet.

Aaron didn't call again, just shot me a couple reminder texts about those library seats - like he was terrified I'd somehow mess up and ruin Sophia's precious study plans.

Meanwhile, Sophia posted on Instagram - a picture from that trendy downtown café I'd been telling Aaron I wanted to try.

Her caption: ""Feels like all my hard work goes nowhere... totally hitting rock bottom rn ? thankful for someone who's been there through it all, hoping we can get away together over break ✨""

Aaron's comment was right there for everyone to see: ""gonna spoil you with all the best food over break ?""

A neat little row of likes and sympathy comments from mutual friends.





I scrolled right past without even tapping to see the full photo.





The day before break started, someone knocked on my dorm door.





I opened it to find Aaron and Sophia standing there.





Sophia immediately flashed me this apologetic smile: ""Rachel! Hope we're not bothering you?""





Aaron was already looking past me into my room, his eyes zeroing in on my carry-on sitting next to my bed. His brow furrowed slightly.





""What's up?"" I stayed in the doorway, clearly not inviting them in.





""Oh, nothing major,"" Aaron said casually. ""Sophia wants to get to the station early tomorrow, so I'm helping her pack. Figured we'd swing by and check on you.""





His gaze drifted back to my suitcase with this scrutinizing look: ""You... manage to get a ticket? Standing room? Same train as us?""





Sophia blinked at me with fake concern: ""It would be so great if you're on our train! That way we can look out for each other, help with bags and stuff...""





Looking at her phony expression, I said slowly: ""I didn't buy a ticket.""





They both froze.





Sophia recovered first, her voice carrying the smugness: ""Oh no! No ticket? Rachel, how are you getting home? Are even the standing room is gone? Oh my gosh, what are you gonna do?""





Aaron's face darkened.





""Rachel, what the hell have you been doing these past two days? I told you to get on booking something. Now you're telling me you have nothing? What, you planning to walk home?""

Watching them play good cop, bad cop, I had to fight back a smirk.

""I have my way to get home,"" I said flatly.

""How exactly?""

Aaron's voice was getting sharp and impatient.

""Still acting tough when you're completely screwed! I knew you were unreliable - can't handle anything properly. And now you're probably gonna blame me again, make it all about how I...""

""Aaron, don't be so hard on Rachel.""

Sophia gently tugged on Aaron's sleeve, then turned to me: ""Rachel, if you're really stuck, my roommate has this apartment off-campus. I could get you the keys...""

She pulled out her phone, tapped around, then held the screen toward me.

The photo showed some dingy studio apartment - water stains on the ceiling, pizza boxes and energy drink cans everywhere, this wobbly IKEA desk covered in moldy coffee mugs and textbooks.

I stared at that disaster of an apartment photo.



""No thanks.""



I turned them down again, glancing between the two of them with the tiniest smile.

""My ride's actually gonna be way faster than your train.""

My crew never made it home.","Look, I'm not gonna give you any real names because we did some pretty sketchy shit out there in the desert. But you can call me Jay, and that's close enough for government work, you know what I mean?

First thing you gotta understand about me is I hate the heat. I mean, I *hate* it. Can't stand the sun beating down on you like some angry god trying to melt your brain into soup. And I'm never, ever going back to the Southwest. Not for all the green chile in Hatch, not for all the silver in the Sandias, not for nothing.

See, I still get these nightmares, man. They come when the sun's getting low and turning all orange and nasty, when those clouds light up like cotton candy at some twisted carnival. In these dreams, I'm back out there sweating bullets, and there's these... things. Dark things, deep underground in the desert, and the heat's like molten lead pouring over everything. I wake up drenched in sweat even when it's snowing outside my apartment here in Portland.

But back in 2005, when I was nineteen and thought I was hot shit? Dude, I thought nothing bad could ever happen to me. Had that bravado that comes with being young and stupid, you know? Thought I was invincible, thought the world owed me something just for showing up.

I was living in a town in New Mexico - not gonna say which one, it's safer that way - and I was couch surfing, staying with some shady people, and doing whatever odd jobs I could find to keep myself in ramen and weed money.

See, I'd been on the outs with my parents since I came out to them the year before. Told them straight up, ""Look, I'm not super picky. Sometimes I like hot dudes, sometimes I like hot chicks."" Real diplomatic like that. My folks like completely flipped out, started going on about sin and hell and how I was gonna burn for eternity. Hijole! You'd think I had told them I was gonna become a serial killer or something.

So they kicked me out when I turned eighteen, and there I was, just being young and dumb in the high desert. Hanging with my friends, getting blazed, thinking I had all the time in the world to get my life together. The heat was always there, pressing down on you like a weight, making everything shimmer and dance in the distance. But I figured I'd adapt, you know? Figured I'd grow into it like a lizard or something.

I was zonked most of the time anyway, so the heat just felt like part of the haze. Plus, I was nineteen and immortal, right? What could go wrong?

Holy shit, man, if I could go back in time and slap some sense into that kid... But everybody thinks that, you know?

So I'm living this hand-to-mouth existence, right? Doing landscaping one day, helping someone move the next, whatever kept me in gas money and munchies. But the work was drying up faster than spit on a sidewalk in July, and I was getting desperate. That's when my dealer - let's call him Miguel - told me he knew a guy who knew a guy who had some work. Under-the-table stuff, good money, no questions asked.

""It's like manual labor, vato,"" Miguel said, passing me this gnarly joint that tasted like it was rolled in old socks. ""But it pays cash, and it pays good.""

I was blazed enough to think this sounded legit, so I said, ""Sure, hook me up.""

The meeting was at this run-down diner on the outskirts of town, the kind of place where the coffee tastes like it was filtered through dirty gym socks and the pie looks older than the waitress. I headed in around two in the afternoon, sweating through my shirt after walking across town.

The guy was sitting in a back booth, and dude, he was off. Like, seriously off. Skin pale as a fish belly, which was trippy as hell because everyone out here gets burnt to leather just walking to their mailbox. His eyes were this pale blue, so light they were almost white, like looking into winter ice. But his hair was jet black, slicked back with so much pomade it looked like an oil spill.

""You must be the young man Miguel recommended,"" he said in a voice that sounded like it came from the bottom of a well. No accent I could place, just... flat. ""He tells me you work well, keep your mouth shut, and don't make waves.""

""Yeah, that's me,"" I said, sliding into the booth across from him. The vinyl was cracked and sticky, and I could feel my thighs already starting to sweat against it. ""What kind of work are we talking about?""

He leaned forward, and I swear the temperature dropped ten degrees. ""Desert work. Manual labor. You and a small crew will drive out to a remote location, spend one night camping, complete a job, and return. The pay is ten thousand dollars.""

My brain practically short-circuited. Ten grand? For one night of work? I was making maybe three hundred a week when I was lucky. This job had more red flags than a Chinese parade, but for ten grand? I was in.

""What's the catch?"" I asked because I wasn't totally stupid.

""No catch. Just hard work in difficult conditions. You'll need to be prepared for the heat."" His pale eyes fixed on mine, and I felt like a bug under a microscope. ""Can you handle the heat?""

The way he said it made my skin crawl, but for ten thousand dollars? Man, that was like hitting the lottery.

""Yeah, I can handle anything,"" I lied.

He slid a business card across the table. It was blank except for an address. ""Tomorrow morning, seven AM sharp. Don't be late.""

And just like that, he stood up and walked out, leaving me sitting there wondering what the hell I'd just signed up for.

The next morning, I walked up to this warehouse on the industrial side of town, the kind of place that looks abandoned but has too many fresh tire tracks in the dirt to actually be empty. The sun was already making the asphalt shimmer, and it wasn't even eight o'clock yet.

There was a white box truck parked outside, and three other guys standing around looking about as confused as I felt.

""Orale. This is some serious hardware,"" said this stocky Hispanic dude with tattoos covering his forearms. He stuck out his hand. ""Pedro.""

""Jay,"" I said, shaking it. His grip was solid, calloused from real work.

The other Hispanic guy introduced himself as Xavier, a quiet type with intelligent eyes that seemed to take in everything. Then there was Red, who had that weathered look of someone who'd spent his whole life under the desert sun. Native features, but I had no idea which tribe. And finally Kate, who I could tell right away was the jefa - the boss lady. Short, built like a fire hydrant, with arms that looked like she could bench press a Honda.

""Alright, listen up,"" Kate said, ticking off items on a clipboard, ""It's a three-hour drive to the site. We're packing food, water, and camping gear because we're staying overnight. This is serious business, not some weekend camping trip. Anyone who can't handle that needs to walk away now.""

Nobody walked.

""Good. Now load up.""

She started directing us to load the equipment into the back. Winch, sledge, coils of rope thick as my wrist, pulleys, camping gear, enough water jugs to fill a swimming pool.

""We riding in the back of the truck to?"" I asked.

""No, in the stretch limo we're renting... of course, in the truck, this isn't a pleasure cruise,"" she replied curtly.

The drive was brutal, man. Kate drove while the rest of us sweated in the back like sardines in a can. No AC, just the tiny hatch from the front propped open, hot air blowing through like a hair dryer set to hell. I kept chugging water and watching the landscape get more and more alien as we headed further from civilization.

Every so often, Kate would pick up the CB radio and say something in code. ""Blue jay to eagle's nest, checking in,"" or ""Cactus flower is clear."" Always got a response in the same cryptic bullshit. Made my paranoid stoner brain start spinning all kinds of theories about what we were really doing out here.

""Where exactly are we going?"" I asked Pedro, who was sitting across from me, mopping sweat off his forehead with a bandana.

""Way out near the lava fields,"" he said. ""Near the Malpais. You know, there are dead volcanoes out there on the border? I didn't know that shit either until today.""

Xavier looked up from where he'd been staring at the equipment, ""Volcanic activity stopped maybe three thousand years ago. Left behind all these lava tubes and formations. Perfect place to hide things.""

""Hide what?"" I asked, but he just shrugged.

Red spoke up for the first time, his voice quiet and gravelly. ""People get killed on digs like this, but money talks louder than common sense.""

That should have been my first real warning, but I was nineteen and stupid and already counting my ten grand in my head. The heat was making me dizzy, and I just wanted to get wherever we were going so I could get out of that rolling oven and into some shade.

We pulled up to the site around ten in the morning, and I have to say, it was like landing on Mars. Nothing but black volcanic rock stretching to the horizon, twisted into weird shapes by ancient fires. The heat hit us like a physical thing when we opened the truck doors, and I immediately started sweating harder than I ever had in my life.

""Set up camp in the shade of that outcropping,"" Kate ordered, pointing to some rocks that cast maybe six feet of shadow. ""And drink water constantly. I don't want anybody dropping from heat stroke.""

I started joking around with Pedro and Xavier, trying to lighten the mood, but Kate shut that down fast.

""Stow that shit and stay focused,"" she snapped. ""This is serious business. People have died out here for being careless.""

Something in her tone made my blood run cold despite the heat. This wasn't just about moving some rocks or digging holes. This was something else entirely.

And I was about to find out what.

After we set up camp - and I use that term loosely because it was basically just throwing our sleeping bags in the only patch of shade we could find - Kate gathered us around and started handing out gear. Heavy work gloves, headlamps, and more water bottles.

""We're going about two hundred yards that way,"" she said, pointing toward what looked like absolutely nothing. Just more twisted black rock under the merciless sun. ""There's a hidden canyon in the lava fields. You'd walk right past it and never see it if you didn't know it was there.""

She was right. We trudged through the heat for a few minutes, sweat pouring off us like we were melting, and I was starting to think she was leading us to our deaths when suddenly the ground just... opened up. One second, we're walking on solid volcanic rock, the next there's this crack in the earth, maybe six feet wide, with boulders and overhangs creating natural cover.

""Whoa,"" Pedro muttered, peering down into the darkness. ""How the hell did anyone find this place?""

Kate went down first, then called up for us to follow. The canyon was maybe thirty feet deep, and the second I hit bottom, the temperature dropped at least fifteen degrees. It was still hot as blazes, but compared to the surface, it felt like walking into air conditioning.

""This way,"" Kate said, leading us toward what looked like a crack in the canyon wall. As we got closer, I realized it was actually the mouth of a cave. A lava tube, probably formed when molten rock flowed through here thousands of years ago.

Xavier was running his hands along the entrance. ""This isn't natural,"" he said quietly. ""Someone carved this wider. Look at the tool marks.""

He was right. The edges of the opening had been chiseled and smoothed, widened from whatever natural formation had been there originally.

""Spanish colonists,"" Kate said, switching on her headlamp. ""We're here to dig up some artifacts they left behind.""

And that's when it hit me what we were really doing out here.

""Oh shit,"" I said, the reality sinking in through my heat-addled brain. ""We're grave robbers, aren't we?""

Kate shrugged. ""Call it archaeological recovery. But yeah, basically. You got a problem with that?""

I thought about the ten grand waiting for me and shook my head. ""Nah, man. Dead Spanish dudes don't need their stuff anymore, right?""

""I've worked a couple of sites where people got hurt doing exactly this kind of off-books digging"", Red said, looking at me with a serious gaze. ""We need to be careful.""

We headed into the lava tube, our headlamps cutting through absolute darkness. The cave opened up into a section that was wider than I expected - maybe forty feet across - with a sandy floor and a massive stone ceiling that disappeared into black above our lights. The walls were rough volcanic rock, but they'd been carved out in places, smoothed and shaped by human hands.

""Start digging here,"" Kate said, pointing to a spot in the center of the cave floor where the sand looked different. Darker, more compacted.

We dug for two hours in that sweltering underground oven, taking turns with the shovels and chugging water like our lives depended on it. Which, looking back, they probably did. Pedro was the first to hit something solid.

""Got something,"" he called out, scraping sand away with his hands. ""Big something.""

What we uncovered made my blood run cold despite the heat.

It was a sarcophagus. Stone, about six feet long, two feet wide, a foot or so deep. But it wasn't like any Spanish artifact I'd ever seen in museums or textbooks. This thing was... weird. The stone was some kind of dark volcanic rock, almost black, covered in carvings that hurt to look at. Not Spanish writing or crosses or anything Christian. These were symbols that seemed to twist and writhe in the light of our headlamps, geometric patterns that made your eyes water if you stared too long.

""That don't look Spanish to me,"" Xavier said, echoing my thoughts.

""Spanish colonists found a lot of indigenous artifacts,"" Kate said, but even she sounded uncertain. ""Probably Anasazi or Pueblo. Pre-Columbian.""

Red was standing at the edge of our excavation, staring down at the sarcophagus with a curious expression. ""That's not Anasazi,"" he said quietly. ""That's not Pueblo. That's not anything from any tribe I know.""

The thing felt wrong in every possible way. Despite being buried in sand in a cave where the temperature had to be pushing ninety degrees, the stone was cold to the touch.  As if it had been sitting in a freezer. And heavy. We'd barely uncovered half of it, and already I could tell this thing weighed a ton.

""How are we supposed to move this?"" I asked, wiping sweat out of my eyes. ""It's gotta weigh like two thousand pounds.""

""That's what the winch is for,"" Kate said. ""We rig pulleys to the ceiling, use the truck as an anchor point outside. It's gonna take all five of us and most of the afternoon, but we can do it.""

Pedro was running his hands over the carved symbols, frowning. ""These markings... they're not worn down like you'd expect from something that old. It's like they were carved yesterday.""

""Maybe because it's so dry?"" Xavier said, but he didn't sound convinced.

I was about to say something else when Red spoke up again, his voice barely above a whisper.

""We shouldn't be doing this. This is federal jurisdiction - BLM, FBI level shit. My brother-in-law got two years for it.""

""Too late for second thoughts,"" Kate said firmly. ""We've got a job to do.""

But as we rigged the pulleys and prepared for the long haul of dragging that cursed thing out of its resting place, I couldn't shake the feeling that Red was right. The sarcophagus seemed to radiate a strange sense of dread, like it was sucking the life out of the air around it.

And the symbols... God, those symbols. Even now, twenty years later, I can still see them when I close my eyes. They seemed to move in my peripheral vision, shifting and changing when I wasn't looking directly at them.

We should have listened to Red. We should have filled that hole back in and walked away.

But we didn't. And what happened next... well, that's when things really went to hell.

It took us until sunset to get that cursed thing out of the cave and drag it to our campsite. Even with the truck and the winch, even with the pulleys and the sledge, even with all five of us working in shifts, it was absolutely brutal work. The sarcophagus fought us every inch of the way, like it wanted to stay buried. The ropes kept slipping, the pulleys jammed, and twice we had to re-rig the whole system when anchor points failed.

By the time we had it pulled to the camp and covered with a heavy canvas tarp, we were all dead on our feet. The sun was setting behind the volcanic peaks, painting the sky the color of dried blood, and the temperature was finally starting to drop from ""surface of Mercury"" to just ""inside an oven.""

""Tomorrow we drag this thing up the ramps into the truck and get the hell out of here,"" Kate said, cracking open a warm beer from the cooler. Even she looked wiped out, her usual fire-hydrant intensity dimmed by exhaustion and heat.

Pedro was already working on getting a fire started, stacking mesquite branches in a ring of volcanic rocks. ""Man, I can't wait to get back to civilization,"" he said, striking a match. ""First thing I'm gonna do is find the biggest, coldest swimming pool and just live in it for a week.""

""What you gonna do with your cut, Jay?"" Xavier asked, settling down on his sleeping bag and pulling off his work boots. His feet were pale and wrinkled with sweat.

I was chugging my dozenth bottle of water of the day, trying to replace what felt like half my body weight in lost fluids. ""Dude, I'm gonna get an apartment with an air conditioner the size of a Buick and never leave. Maybe get a little refrigerator just for beer. Live like a king in climate-controlled comfort.""

""Ten grand goes fast,"" Red said quietly. He'd been even more withdrawn since we'd uncovered the sarcophagus, sitting apart from the group and staring at that tarp-covered shape like it might sprout legs and walk away. ""Hope it's worth pissing off the feds.""

""Come on, hermano,"" Pedro said, getting the fire going properly. The flames cast dancing shadows across the black volcanic rock. ""This is easy money.""

Kate was digging through the food supplies, pulling out cans of beans and packages of hot dogs. ""Red, what're you going to use the money for?""

""I'm behind on my truck payments and need it to keep working"", he said, ""plus my kid's meds..."", but he didn't continue. Just sat there watching the fire.

""You know what I'm gonna do?"" Xavier said, accepting a beer from Kate, ""I'm gonna take my girl Maria to Vegas. Get a nice hotel room with a view, eat at those fancy buffets, and maybe try my luck at the tables. She's been wanting to go forever.""

""Vegas in summer?"" Pedro laughed, stabbing hot dogs with a stick to roast them over the fire. ""That's like trading one oven for another, vato.""

""Yeah, but Vegas has casinos with AC you could hang meat in. And pools. And room service."" Xavier grinned. ""Besides, Maria looks good in a bikini.""

Even Kate cracked a smile at that. The mood was lighter as the sun went down and the oppressive heat finally started to ease up. The beans were bubbling in a pot over the fire, mixing with the smell of roasting hot dogs and mesquite smoke. After the brutal day we'd had, it felt almost normal. Like we were just a bunch of friends camping in the desert instead of grave robbers who'd just dug up something that made my skin crawl.

""What about you, jefa?"" I asked Kate. ""What's the boss lady gonna do with her cut?""

She was quiet for a moment, stirring the beans with a long-handled spoon. ""Pay off some debts. Maybe take a real vacation somewhere with trees and actual grass. Haven't seen green in so long I'm starting to forget what it looks like.""

""Where'd you grow up?"" Pedro asked, handing around the roasted hot dogs.

""Michigan. Near the lakes. Used to swim in water so clear and cold it'd shock your system."" She got a distant look in her eyes. ""Sometimes I dream about diving into that water, feeling it close over my head, washing all this desert dust away.""

""So why'd you come out here to hell's front porch?"" I asked, biting into my hot dog. Even camp food tasted good when you were this tired and hungry.

""Same reason we all did, probably. Running from something, looking for something else. Desert's a good place to disappear if you need to."" She said.

Red joined the conversation, accepting a plate of beans and hot dogs. ""I need this money. Things are tight. I have a family. They're all waiting.""

""Waiting for what?"" Xavier asked.

""Waiting for me to get my shit together,"" He chuckled, the first bit of warmth I'd heard in his voice.

The food was warm, the fire was crackling, and the temperature had dropped to something almost comfortable. The stars were coming out in the clear desert sky, more stars than you ever see in town, stretching from horizon to horizon.

""You know what?"" Kate said, leaning back against her pack and looking more relaxed than I'd seen her all day. ""Maybe Red's right to be cautious, but we did good work today. That thing's been sitting down there for who knows how long, and we got it out clean. No cave-ins, no injuries, no major problems. Tomorrow we load it up and drive back to civilization, and we all walk away ten grand richer.""

""I'll drink to that,"" Pedro said, raising his beer.

We all clinked bottles and cans, even Red, though he still kept glancing at the tarp. The fire popped and crackled, sending sparks up into the desert night, and for a while there, it felt like maybe everything was going to be okay.

Maybe we'd actually pulled this off.

Maybe Red was just being paranoid.

Maybe those symbols on the sarcophagus were just some old indigenous art that meant nothing more than ""here lies so-and-so, may he rest in peace.""

Man, we were so wrong it wasn't even funny.

I woke up around three in the morning, and the first thing I noticed was the smell. Not a normal desert smell like smoke or dust or mesquite. This was different. Unnatural. Like chemicals mixed with vomit.

The second thing I noticed was the light.

There was this glow coming from under the tarp covering the sarcophagus. Not bright, just a dim pulse like a dying flashlight, but the color... man, I can't even describe it properly. It wasn't red or blue or green or any color that has a name. It was the color of fever dreams and bad acid trips, the color of things that couldn't... *shouldn't* exist.

I sat up in my sleeping bag, rubbing my eyes, thinking maybe I was still dreaming. But it was real, the smell sharp enough to make me wince. The fire had died down to glowing embers, and everyone else was still asleep around the camp.

Everyone except Pedro.

""Pedro?"" I whispered. His sleeping bag was empty.

That's when I heard it. A grinding sound, like stone scraping against stone, coming from under the tarp. Slow, deliberate, like something heavy being moved by something that didn't care about making noise.

The glow under the tarp pulsed brighter, and the grinding got louder.

I should have woken the others. Should have grabbed Kate and shaken her awake, should have started yelling. Instead, I just sat there like an idiot, watching that impossible light seep through the canvas.

Then the grinding stopped.

The quiet that followed was worse than the noise. It was the kind of silence that presses against your eardrums, thick and heavy and full of waiting.

Something moved in the darkness beyond our camp. Something big.

""Pedro?"" I called out, louder this time. My voice cracked like I was twelve years old again.

A scream answered me from somewhere out in the lava fields. High, terrified, and human. It started as Pedro's voice - I'd know that voice anywhere after spending all day working next to the guy - but it changed as it went on. Got higher, more animalistic, like he was being torn apart while he made the sound.

Then it cut off.

The silence came back, and that awful smell, and that pulsing light under the tarp that hurt to look at.

""What the hell..."" Kate was sitting up now, reaching for the flashlight beside her sleeping bag.

""Don't,"" I whispered, but she was already switching it on, sweeping the beam across our campsite.

The tarp had shifted. The sarcophagus was partially uncovered, and even in the dim light, I could see that the lid was open. Not just cracked open - wide open, like the jaws of some stone predator. The symbols carved into the sides were glowing with that nameless color, pulsing in rhythm like a heartbeat.

""Where's Pedro?"" Xavier was awake now, too, his voice tight with fear.

Another scream echoed from the darkness, further away this time. Definitely human at first, then dissolving into something else. Something wet and broken.

Red was on his feet, grabbing his boots. ""We need to go. Right now.""

""Go where?"" Kate demanded, but she was already moving, stuffing her sleeping bag into her pack. ""What the hell is happening?""

A shadow moved at the edge of our firelight. Not the shadow of a person - too tall, too wide, moving in ways that were hard to follow.

""The truck,"" Red said urgently. ""Get to the truck.""

But I couldn't move. I was staring at that open sarcophagus, at those glowing symbols, at the absolute darkness inside where something had been lying for God knows how long. The smell was getting worse, seeping into my pores, making my eyes burn, and I realized I was shaking uncontrollably.

That's when I heard Xavier's scream.

He was trying to run toward the truck when something massive erupted from the shadows. One second, he was there, the next he was airborne, thrashing and yelling as something huge dragged him into the dark. His screams echoed in the night, raw and getting fainter and more desperate until they turned into that same wet, animalistic bleating I'd heard from Pedro.

""Run!"" Kate yelled. ""Everyone run!""

Red was already moving, sprinting toward the truck. I tried to follow, but my legs felt like jelly, and the oppressive darkness was making it hard to think, hard to breathe. Behind me, I could hear something large moving through the camp, displacing rocks, getting closer.

I stumbled after Red, tripping over volcanic debris. He had maybe a twenty-foot head start when the shadow caught him.

I saw it happen in my peripheral vision - this massive dark shape flowing over the ground like a liquid nightmare. Red didn't even have time to scream before it wrapped around him and yanked him sideways into the darkness. There was a wet, tearing sound, like shredding meat, then nothing.

That got me moving faster than I'd ever moved in my life.

I reached the truck just as Kate came running up from the other direction, her face a mask of terror in the starlight. She had the keys.

""Get it started!"" I gasped, throwing myself into the passenger seat.

Her hands were shaking so badly that she dropped the keys twice before getting them in the ignition. The engine turned over on the third try, headlights cutting through the darkness.

""Where are they?"" she whispered. ""Where is everybody?""

I didn't answer. Couldn't answer. Because I could see shapes moving in our headlight beams, strange shapes that shouldn't exist, and I knew exactly where everybody was.

""Just go!"" I hissed.

Kate put the truck in gear and started to drive, but we only made it about fifty yards before something slammed into the driver's side with enough force to tip us over.

Then the truck slid, metal screaming against volcanic rock, before coming to rest on its side. My head cracked against the passenger window, and for a few seconds, everything went sparkly and dark.

When my vision cleared, Kate was hanging in her seatbelt, blood streaming from a gash on her forehead. The windshield was spider-webbed with cracks, and something was moving outside.

""Jay,"" she whispered. ""Jay, help me get out of this belt.""

I tried to reach up, but my left arm wasn't working right. Probably broken. Through the cracked windshield, I could see massive shadows circling the truck, patient and deliberate.

That's when the driver's side window exploded inward.

Something dark and impossibly strong reached in from above through the broken glass and grabbed Kate by the shoulders. Her seatbelt snapped like tissue paper, and she started screaming as whatever had her began dragging her through the window frame, folding her like a lawn chair.

""Jay!"" she screamed, her face appearing in the truck's lights for just a second. Blood covered her features like a crimson mask, her eyes wide with absolute terror. ""Help!""

Then something jerked her back into the darkness, and the screaming started in earnest. High and desperate at first, then dissolving into those same inhuman sounds of abject terror and pain I'd heard from the others. The sounds of being torn apart by something that took its time.

I lay there in the overturned truck, listening to Kate die, too broken and terrified to move. The headlights were still on, pointed at crazy angles, illuminating patches of volcanic rock and shadow. And in those shadows, something moved. Something big. Something hungry.

Something that had been waiting in the dark for thousands of years.

The screaming stopped.

Everything went quiet except for the tick of cooling metal and my own panicked breathing.

I waited there for what felt like hours, sure that any second something was going to reach through the broken windows and drag me out to join the others. But nothing happened. The shadows moved and shifted, but they kept their distance from the truck.

Maybe it'd had enough for one night. Or maybe it was just savoring the fear, letting me marinate in terror before the final course. I don't know why it didn't take me.

But as the hours passed and the sky started to lighten, the shadows began to fade. By the time the sun came up, painting the desert in shades of gold and red that reminded me too much of that impossible light under the tarp, I was alone.

Completely, utterly alone.

It took what felt like forever to crawl out of the truck. My left arm was definitely broken, and I was pretty sure I had a concussion, but I could walk. Sort of. I grabbed a half-empty bottle of water and stood up.

I must have been in shock when I started walking toward the road, leaving behind the overturned truck, the empty campsite, and that cursed sarcophagus with its lid hanging open like a stone mouth that had finally finished feeding.

I walked for two hours in the desert heat before a state trooper found me, half-dead from dehydration and babbling about monsters in the dark. They took me to the hospital, and for the better part of a day, a pair of grim-faced detectives asked me the same questions over and over, making it clear they thought I was either high, crazy, or a murderer.

I told them we'd had an accident. Vehicle rollover. The others had wandered off in the dark, looking for help, and never came back. Search and rescue found the truck, but never found any bodies. They never found the box either, or at least they didn't say.

Then, just as they were getting ready to haul me to a county jail cell, *he* showed up. The pale man from the diner. He walked into my hospital room wearing a crisp black suit in defiance of the desert heat. He didn't say a word to me, instead pulling the lead detective into the hallway. I saw him quietly show the detective some kind of identification in a leather wallet. The cop, who had been ready to charge me with four homicides, just went pale himself and nodded.

A minute later, the detective came back in, told me I was free to go, and that my story of a ""tragic camping accident"" had been corroborated. He couldn't get out of the room fast enough.

The pale man stepped in as the cops left, his icy blue eyes fixing on me. He tossed a roll of cash on the bed.

""Five hundred for your time,"" he said, voice like gravel scraped from the bottom of a well. ""The job wasn’t completed.""

""Completed?""I croaked, trying to sit up.""They’re dead. They’re *all* dead. What the hell was in that box?""

He didn’t blink. ""Risk was part of the deal. You thought ten grand was for a camping trip?""

My mouth was dry, throat raw.""What was it? Who are you? What *is* this?""

His expression darkened. ""Too many questions.""

He took a step toward the door.

""I’ve got a mess to clean up,"" he said, quieter now, almost to himself. ""And you don’t want any of it landing on you.""

I stared at him. I was broken, confused, terrified. He paused, hand on the knob, and for the briefest second, something like pity flickered across his face.

""Take the money. Leave town. Don’t look back. Find somewhere to go, kid. Don’t *think* too much.""

Then he was gone, leaving nothing but the antiseptic stink of the hospital and the weight of everything he didn’t say.

I used the money to buy a Greyhound ticket to Portland, as far from the desert as I could afford to get. I never got my ten grand, but I got something else - the knowledge that there are things in the dark places of this world that make death look like a mercy.

And sometimes, when the sun is setting low and orange and those clouds are lit up like cotton candy, I still have the dreams. Dreams about symbols that glow with colors that don't exist, about blood-covered faces in the dark, and about the sounds people made when something ancient and hungry takes them.

Survivor's guilt is a bitch.

I never went back to New Mexico. Never will.

It's a hard lesson to learn, but some jobs don't pay enough, no matter what the money looks like up front.

And some things should definitely stay buried.

My husband's name is James Morgan.

Without hesitation, I drove straight to that school.

The teacher smiled: ""Alex's parents just picked him up.""

I quietly followed and caught them red-handed - my husband holding a little boy's hand, his other arm around some strange woman, laughing softly.

My grip tightened on my phone as I called him. I kept my voice perfectly steady.

""Hey babe, when are you coming home?""

""Business trip's running long. Probably three more days.""

I hung up.

Raised my phone and captured the perfect shot of all three of them together.

""Well, James Morgan,"" I whispered to myself. ""What a lovely surprise.""

""Message received, loud and clear.""





Chapter 1





Everyone's been obsessed with that viral mess -





Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and his HR chief Kristin Cabot getting caught on Coldplay's kiss cam, then scrambling to hide from the jumbotron like guilty teenagers.





I was scrolling through all the affair speculation thinking:





Pttttttf. At least my husband isn't that obvious.





Then BOOM.





I found a parent-teacher notice in James's suit pocket while doing laundry.





It wasn't from our daughter's school.





Student name: Alex Morgan. Parent: James Morgan.





My husband's name is James Morgan.





Without hesitation, I drove straight to that school.





The teacher smiled: ""Alex's parents just picked him up.""





I quietly followed and caught them red-handed - my husband holding a little boy's hand, his other arm around some strange woman, laughing softly.





My grip tightened on my phone as I called him. I kept my voice perfectly steady.





""Hey babe, when are you coming home?""





""Business trip's running long. Probably three more days.""





I hung up.





Raised my phone and captured the perfect shot of all three of them together.





""Well, James Morgan,"" I whispered to myself. ""What a lovely surprise.""





""Message received, loud and clear.""





...





The next day, I attended the school's parent-family networking event as a shareholder representative.





It didn't take long to spot Michelle in the crowd.





White sundress, natural makeup, the picture of wholesome elegance.





I walked straight over and positioned myself right beside her.





""Miss Michelle, isn't it? I've heard so much about you."" I smiled warmly. ""That dress is absolutely stunning on you.""





She turned at the sound of my voice.





The moment she saw my face, all color drained from hers.





Bingo.





So our little angel wasn't as innocent as she pretended to be.





Her voice came out tight and strained. She instinctively took half a step back. ""Oh... hello.""





Just a simple greeting, and she was already falling apart.





How pathetically fragile.





""My husband is one of the school's shareholders,"" I continued pleasantly. ""I'm here representing him today. I heard you're on the parent committee?""





Her voice steadied, but her eyes kept darting around. ""Just trying to do my part.""





""It's nice to stay involved, you know? Otherwise being a stay-at-home mom gets pretty boring. Just revolving around your husband and kids all day.""





Perfect.





Not only was she playing up her own contributions, but she was taking a little dig at my current ""unemployed"" status too.





I noticed her unconsciously fidgeting with the ring on her left hand.





That style looked awfully familiar.





Exactly like the one sitting in my jewelry box at home.





I kept my tone casual, conversational. ""Beautiful ring, by the way. Looks expensive. Is that your wedding band?""





She immediately covered the ring with her other hand. Her expression turned even more panicked.





She opened her mouth but only managed a strangled sound.





I didn't expect an answer anyway.





""Your son goes to school here too, right? What grade?""





She answered very carefully. ""Second... second grade. He'll be eight in August.""





Eight in August.





I did the math quickly in my head.





How convenient.





Nine years ago, James had started taking those frequent ""business trips"" to ""expand into new markets.""





Gone for months at a time, home for maybe two weeks total over six months.





Suddenly everything clicked into place.





Back then, our daughter Zoe had just been born. James was either ""networking"" or ""on his way to network.""





When we did talk, it was always rushed. ""Thanks for holding down the fort, babe. I'm swamped here, can't get away... You're doing great... Maybe hire a better nanny...""





I didn't want to interfere with his work. No matter how exhausted or overwhelmed I got, I handled everything myself.





I only ever told him ""everything's fine.""





Turns out his ""networking"" and ""can't get away"" meant he was playing full-time daddy to Michelle during her pregnancy.





I took a sip of my coffee to hide the ice in my eyes. When I looked up again, my smile was perfectly pleasant.





""What a coincidence. My daughter's about the same age.""





She managed a weak smile but didn't respond.





I acted like something had just occurred to me. Pulled out some papers from my purse.





""Oh, this is funny. My husband came home with this school newsletter last week. The handwritten suggestions in the back are yours, aren't they? Such lovely penmanship.""





I watched all remaining color drain from her face.





Her voice came out like sandpaper. ""No... that wasn't me.""





She's denying it.





Pathetic.





Looking at her crumbling facade, I suddenly felt bored.





""Oh, my mistake then."" I tucked the papers away. ""Well, see you around. Hope you stay this... composed.""





I turned and walked straight out of the venue.





Outside, I pulled out my phone and called my best friend. She's a founding partner at one of the top law firms in the city.





""Jenna, I need a favor.""





Sunlight streamed down as I opened my car door.





The engine purred to life like the opening note of a symphony.





My voice was calm as still water.





""Remember that thing you were helping me navigate? Don't worry about it anymore.""





""I need you to draw up divorce papers instead.""





""That's right. James is cheating. And I'm about to give him the surprise of his life.""





Chapter 2





Jenna worked fast.





In less than half a day, my inbox had a new encrypted file. The message was short and sweet: ""Brace yourself. Call me ASAP.""





I locked myself in my home office to get reacquainted with my husband.





The first video file opened.

I made a post the other day ranting about how hard quitting is, so I felt I should make a post about how great it has been as well.

Honestly, two weeks in and the cravings have decreased immensely. the urge pops in my head probably 3 times a day now, not too bad.

Positives so far-
1. More energy. I’m no longer waking up at 5am and thinking ehhh might as well get up super early so I can enjoy some vape time before my day starts lol. Sad but true. Anyways I’m sleeping better, less interrupted and longer.
2. Tmi but I’ve dealt with constipation for a while and for some reason I have had regular great bowel movements over the last week, haven’t changed anything else soo must be related??
3. I used to get so anxious I felt like I couldn’t take a deep breath. Have not felt that since quitting, my body actually feels calm.
4. I’m more present in the moment. Which was my main motivation for quitting. I have a two year old, and I know these years go so fast. I’ve been able to just be with her instead of thinking how can I sneak away for a hit. Sad, I know. All I can do is look forward. 
5. Typically on a Sunday I’d lay in bed with coffee and my vape (my morning to sleep in), but today I woke up and got ready for the gym. I’m really craving the rush of an intense workout ! I’m hoping that’s my dopamine getting back to normal.


My main motivation to quit was that I looked forward to waking up so I could vape. How fucking sad is that. I have an amazing husband, a daughter I love and enjoy, a job I’m passionate about, I’m healthy and functioning welll, but THAT is what keeps me going? No. I’m done letting an addiction take over my reward centers and stop me from fully experiencing and enjoying live. I will not go back. ",4,1758505449.0,QuitVaping,3,1.0,False

Not a full-blown gym rat, but I’m flirting with a six-pack. Give me a month or two and it’ll be official. 😂

By trade I'm a pilot. Many ratings and thousands of hours in dozens of planes. Most recently I was in management and trained pilots. I've recently decided to go back to flying. I also have a white collar professional side-gig that I do. (Not uber eats or uber lol!!!)

I’m a divorced dad with a 12-year-old daughter, and we do the 50/50 custody thing. My ex and I actually get along (I know, shocking), and people compliment us on how drama-free it is. Honestly, you could grab a coffee with her and she’d probably give me a decent Yelp review. Joking lol (we are divorced for reason haha)

After the divorce (my idea), I did the whole “personal growth” thing. No baggage, no “crazy ex” stories—just came out the other side in a solid spot.

I’m looking for a relationship where 1+1 = 3. A partnership that’s fun, a little banter, some random adventures, and actual teamwork when it comes to building a great life. I’m easygoing, kind, adaptable, and rely way more on common sense than textbooks (though I did get the degree).

I’ve traveled a lot (military brat perks), five continents and counting. Would love someone who’s adventurous, funny, honest, and can handle both a Bolivian mountain hike at 13,000 feet and a Netflix marathon without complaint.

I’m an extroverted introvert; social, but I also appreciate my recharge time. Not materialistic, but thankfully not broke either. I’ve got my own place, my own car, and a solid job. My dad raised me old school: build a guitar? Done. Fix a car? Done. Random home repair? Done (eventually).

I’m not in a rush, but I’d love to find someone fun, grounded, and ready to build something strong. And yeah, long-distance isn’t my jam; so Texas ladies, you’ve got home-field advantage.

I'm the real deal. I don't have any ""gotchas"" or weird crap where I misrepresent myself and you figure it out later and go ""why did I fall for this!"" So are you ready to have a good relationship that is rarely boring, honest, has good communication, and is laughs?

My (32M) partner (28F) and I have been having a pretty rocky year in our 2 year long relationship. Recently in the last month, I called the cops on her as she threw coffee on my MacBook and hit me over the head with a mug. The whole calling the cops situation was pretty traumatic and we decided after we would still try make it work to the disapproval of my family. I told my dad about the situation and he evidently told the rest of my family and aren’t very happy about it which is making me feel more isolated. Her mum also blames me for all the trouble and cost of this for calling the cops as my life wasn’t in danger and my gf says I am to blame as much as her as I am not able to validate her in the way she wants, leading to the escalation. I will admit in conflict when it goes on too long or when things are constantly brought up that I thought we resolved I do get really tired and lose patience with it after an hour or so and can start to get quite snappy and blunt. But there is a lot of tension between us and it’s difficult with our families opinions involved and I seem to be taking most of the blame which I find unfair.

1nn9eom,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nn9eom/rf_grandpas_pipe/,[RF] Grandpa's Pipe,"The bell above the door of The Briar & Ash chimed a melody as old and dusty as the shop itself. Arthur stepped inside, carrying a small, worn leather valise, and the scent hit him instantly—a complex perfume of cured leaves, sweet cherry, and a hint of old leather. It was the scent of his grandfather's study, a place of quiet contemplation he had never fully understood.
​He felt out of place among the mahogany display cases and shelves packed with curious tools. To Arthur, the pipes his grandfather had left behind were simply a collection of odd wooden objects. He hadn't come here to appreciate them; he had come to sell them.

​Behind the counter, a man with a beard the color of pipe smoke looked up from a half-finished bowl. His face was a testament to a life lived without haste, and his eyes, a gentle grey, held a quiet warmth. ""Lost, son?"" he asked, his voice a low rumble.

​""No, sir,"" Arthur said, placing the valise on the counter. ""I, uh, I have a few things here. My grandfather's pipes. I'm looking to sell them.""
​The man's gaze softened as he carefully unlatched the valise. He didn't rummage through them; he lifted each one with a reverence Arthur had never seen. There was the gnarled briar with a silver band, the elegant meerschaum carved into a ship, and the stout, rustic churchwarden.
​""These aren't just things to be sold, son,"" the man said, holding a smooth, well-loved bent pipe. ""These are stories. Your grandfather’s memories, his quiet moments, his very breath—it's all soaked into the wood. The value isn't in the bowl; it's in the journey."" He looked at Arthur, his gaze direct but not unkind. ""Do you even know how to smoke one?""

​Arthur felt a knot of frustration loosen into a flicker of curiosity. ""No. I never got the point.""
​A soft, knowing smile spread across the old man's face. ""Then let's find out."" He reached for a small tin of tobacco and a handful of strange tools, his eyes twinkling with a sense of purpose. ""This isn't about the smoke, boy. It's about the ritual. The time it gives you to just be.""
​Silas slid a small tin of tobacco across the counter. ""This is called 'Quiet Evening.' It's a blend for thinkers.""

​Arthur opened it, revealing fine strands of dark, fragrant tobacco. Silas demonstrated the proper way to fill the pipe. ""The three-layer pack,"" he explained. ""Bottom is light and airy, for an easy start. The middle is a bit tighter for flavor. And the top, just a gentle press, to keep the cherry lit."" Arthur's first attempt was a tight, solid wad that refused to draw. His second was too loose, and the tobacco fell out. Silas chuckled patiently. ""It's a dance, not a chore. The pipe tells you what it wants.""

​On the third try, Arthur found the right pressure. He felt a soft give, a springiness that felt just right. He took a long, slow draw as Silas lit the bowl, and the warm, earthy smoke filled his mouth. It was nothing like a cigarette. There was no harshness, only a complex, rich flavor that unfolded on his tongue. He was focused entirely on the feel of the stem, the temperature of the bowl, and the slow, rhythmic puffing that kept the ember glowing.

​As he smoked, a strange peace settled over him. His anxieties about the shop and his grandfather's legacy began to fade, replaced by a quiet, focused attention. He ran his thumb over the smooth, worn surface of the briar, feeling the tiny nicks and dents that spoke of a thousand forgotten conversations.

​Then, his thumb snagged on something. He rotated the pipe in the light. Near the base of the bowl, tucked away almost invisibly under the silver band, was a tiny, intricate carving. It was so faint it was barely visible—a small anchor, and beneath it, the initials H.W. and a date: 1924. He had handled this pipe a dozen times, yet had never noticed it.

​""Silas, look at this,"" Arthur said, his voice a low whisper.
​Silas peered over his spectacles, his eyes widening slightly. ""Well, I'll be,"" he murmured, taking the pipe from Arthur's hand. He ran a calloused finger over the mark. ""I’ve seen a lot of pipes, but this… an artisan’s mark, perhaps? Or a secret signature?"" He looked at Arthur, his gaze direct but not unkind. ""That pipe wasn't just your grandfather's, boy. It belonged to someone else before him, and it seems they left a piece of their story in the wood.""

​""The initials H.W. and an anchor from 1924,"" Silas murmured, his eyes thoughtful. ""That's no coincidence. An anchor is a common symbol for sailors, of course, but combined with that date… it’s a specific mark, a personal one. We need to look for a man, a hero perhaps, with those initials, who was in the Navy around that time.""

​They spent the next few hours in a small, quiet library just a few blocks from the shop. Arthur, who had come to the city to get away from his grandfather's past, now found himself poring over it, fueled by a newfound curiosity. He and Silas consulted old naval yearbooks and microfiche records. The musty scent of ancient paper replaced the aroma of tobacco.

​Finally, Silas let out a quiet exclamation, pointing to an article from a 1925 naval magazine. ""Look here,"" he said, his finger tracing a line on the yellowed page. ""A commendation for service awarded to Lieutenant Commander Harrison Wells.""

​The article described a daring act of seamanship in the Pacific Ocean in the winter of 1924. Wells, a young officer, had led his crew in a courageous rescue of a vessel caught in a rogue storm, a feat considered nearly impossible. A small, blurry photograph showed a stern-faced, handsome man standing on the deck of a ship, a small pipe tucked into his uniform pocket.

​Arthur stared at the picture, then at the pipe in his hand. The briar felt different now, no longer a relic, but a tangible link to a heroic story. It had belonged to a man who had faced down a storm at sea. It was a witness to courage.
​But the most perplexing question remained. The article mentioned Harrison Wells' family and his long career, but made no mention of any connection to Arthur's grandfather. How had this pipe, a testament to a naval hero, found its way into a collection of quiet memories in a landlocked city? The journey of the pipe was far more than a simple transaction; it was a mystery spanning generations.

​Arthur and Silas sat back in the library's heavy wooden chairs, the image of Lieutenant Commander Harrison Wells still vivid in their minds. The pipe, now a silent artifact of heroism, lay between them.
​""Your grandfather, God rest his soul, was a man of quiet habits,"" Silas mused, stroking his beard. ""But even the quietest men have their pasts. And 1924… that was a time of many transitions. The world was still settling after the Great War, and even for those who hadn't seen direct combat, its echoes lingered.""

​Arthur remembered fragmented stories, hints his grandmother had occasionally dropped. His grandfather, Thomas, had been a young man during that era, but he’d rarely spoken of his early adulthood. There was a gap, a hazy period before he settled down, bought his first small shop, and started his family.
​Then, a memory surfaced, a faint whisper from a long-forgotten family anecdote. ""My grandmother once mentioned... before he opened his haberdashery, my grandfather spent some time working on the docks. In San Francisco. She said he’d always loved the smell of the sea, even though he never went far from land.""
​Silas's eyes lit up. ""San Francisco! The primary port for the Pacific Fleet in 1924. Harrison Wells's ship, the USS Reliant, was often stationed there. It makes sense. Dockworkers and sailors, their paths crossed constantly.""

​The pieces began to click into place. It wasn't hard to imagine Thomas, a young man finding his way in the bustling port city, perhaps even working on the very docks where the Reliant was repaired after its heroic rescue.
​Silas continued, ""Imagine, Arthur. Your grandfather, a civilian, but likely privy to the stories, the camaraderie, the danger that these sailors faced. And Wells, a celebrated officer, but perhaps also just a man who enjoyed a quiet smoke after a harrowing experience.""

​They pictured it: a bustling San Francisco pier, the salty air thick with the scent of tar and brine. Harrison Wells, perhaps nursing a mug of coffee after a long watch or a demanding rescue, finds a moment of respite. And Thomas, perhaps a young dockworker with a keen eye for craftsmanship, notices the distinct pipe, the symbol of resilience in the face of the sea.
​Perhaps Thomas, captivated by the story of courage, had simply admired the pipe, expressing his respect for Wells’s bravery. And Wells, recognizing a kindred spirit, a man who understood the value of a quiet moment and a well-packed bowl, gifted it to him as a token of shared humanity. A silent passing of a tangible memory from one man who understood the weight of life's experiences to another.

​""So, the pipe wasn't just given to my grandfather,"" Arthur murmured, looking at the briar anew. ""It was a hand-off. A story passed on, person to person, without a single word needed to be said about it."" The pipe was not merely a collection of wood and silver; it was a bridge across decades, connecting two men through a shared, unwritten understanding of respect and survival.

​Back in the quiet warmth of The Briar & Ash, the valise lay open between Arthur and Silas. But the pipes inside no longer looked like relics destined for a buyer's shelf. Each one, from the common briars to the hero's pipe, was now imbued with a story—a memory of Thomas and his quiet life, and a shadow of Harrison Wells’s courageous one.

​""He never told us,"" Arthur said, tracing the faint outline of the anchor with a gentle finger. ""He had this amazing story inside his collection, and he never once mentioned it.""
​Silas nodded, his gaze thoughtful. ""Some of the most important stories aren't told with words, son. They're held in objects. They're carried in traditions. Your grandfather wasn't just a man who smoked pipes; he was a custodian of stories, of quiet moments and profound connections.""
​Arthur looked down at the collection, no longer seeing a monetary value, but a priceless link to a history he hadn't known existed. The very act of researching the pipe had not only revealed the story of Harrison Wells, but had also unlocked a new understanding of his own grandfather. The man he'd thought of as merely a gentle, unassuming shop owner was, in his own way, a keeper of bravery.

​He took the valiant briar pipe and placed it carefully back in its felt slot. Then, with a newfound reverence, he closed the lid of the valise, a final click that sealed his decision.
​""I'm not selling them,"" he said, the words feeling natural and true. ""Not now. Not ever."" He looked at Silas, a genuine smile on his face. ""My grandfather didn't just leave me a collection; he left me a legacy. And a way to understand it.""
​Silas returned the smile, his eyes twinkling. ""Then you'll need something to continue that legacy with."" He reached for a tin of aromatic tobacco. ""A blend that tastes of new beginnings, perhaps. It will be a fitting start to your own story.""
​Arthur stepped out of the shop and onto the sunlit sidewalk, the chime of the bell a gentle farewell. The valise felt lighter in his hand, no longer a burden of things to be sold, but a treasured inheritance. The mystery of the pipes was solved, but a new chapter had just begun. He wasn't just a man with a pipe now; he was a man connected to the past, and ready to embrace a quiet, thoughtful future, one peaceful smoke at a time",2,1758504230.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

This isn't me getting nervous before a job interview - this is my nervous system treating a trip to the grocery store like I'm about to fight a bear.

What people don't get is that anxiety rewires your entire existence. I've become a detective of my own body, constantly checking: Is my heart racing? Are my shoulders up to my ears again? Why does my stomach feel like I swallowed rocks?

I've had to become an expert in things I never wanted to know about. I know exactly which foods will send me spiraling (goodbye forever, beloved coffee). I know that fluorescent lights can trigger me. I know that certain smells or sounds can launch me into full panic mode.

The physical stuff is brutal. My body is literally falling apart - jaw constantly clenched, back full of knots, immune system destroyed. The isolation hurts more: canceling plans until friends stop inviting you, sitting in parking lots for 20 minutes to work up courage to enter a store, leaving work because normal sounds feel like torture.

**BUT** (and this is a huge but)...

I've also learned that I'm stronger than I thought. Every time I manage to do something my anxiety says is ""impossible,"" even if it's tiny, I'm building evidence that I CAN do this.

I've discovered tools that actually work for ME - not the typical ""just breathe deeply"" advice everyone gives, but my own strategies. I've learned to negotiate with my anxious brain instead of fighting against it.

That’s what I love exploring in Paradise — how food, culture, and style are not just about what we consume or wear, but about the moments we create. Rituals remind us that beauty isn’t only found in big events, but also in the ordinary patterns that shape our lives. ✨

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I have a case I would like to share for analysis:

I have a female colleague at work who seems kind on the surface, but her behavior can be annoying and uncomfortable at times. For example, she often knocks on the bathroom door in front of everyone and yells at whoever is inside to hurry up, which puts her in an awkward position in front of colleagues.

Her personality also carries many “masculine” traits, both in her walk and mannerisms. She speaks loudly, which can be irritating. She is extremely observant; for instance, she noticed I was wearing new shoes even though my pants fully covered them. She also makes strange comments like, “This outfit is great because it doesn’t show your curves inappropriately and covers them well,” which made me question and worry whether my attire was inappropriate for work, even though my mother confirmed it was perfectly fine.

She tends to share personal details unusually openly, even with the manager. I was recently surprised to find out that my manager knows I am planning to buy a car, even though I had only told her, which made me question

Additionally, she frequently visits the manager’s office, sometimes bringing him food or sweets that we, the female colleagues, have prepared, and she regularly brings him coffee once or twice a week, sometimes more. The manager’s interactions with her are also unusual; he teases her in ways that can feel like disguised insults, commenting on her face, nails, or clothing, yet she responds in kind and jokes back. He also asks her to do odd tasks, such as going to another building to fetch an employee or distributing sweets to the team despite having someone else assigned for that.

From my perspective, their relationship seems unhealthy or at least unbalanced. What intrigues me most is her personality. She is married with children and should be more mature and composed, yet her behavior resembles that of a 13-year-old teenager.

I want to know how to deal with her because I don’t feel comfortable around her. I try to be polite and engage in conversation, but I can’t—I feel she is odd. She is kind at times; for example, she brings me coffee and asks why I didn’t come to our private break room, but she often gathers the other female colleagues there and talks with them. In fact, about 80% of her time at work is spent talking and walking around chatting with people.

I have set boundaries with her; when she comes to talk to me, I show that I’m busy because she doesn’t stop talking. This has made her dislike that I no longer converse much with her.

She also acts as a leader or guide for the female colleagues in the department, directing them and telling them what to do. I sometimes do not accept her guidance and refuse, which makes her upset. For example, she once told us to give someone at work a gift for a trivial reason. I chose not to participate, and she avoided speaking to me for two days. The atmosphere among the other female colleagues became tense toward me, and they looked at me strangely, but I ignored it completely, smiling and greeting them as if nothing had happened, which was true.

Since I am interested in studying personalities and behavioral patterns, I like to analyze people I encounter. I would like an analysis of her personality and her relationship with the manager, along with any scientific references or sources that could help me understand this type of workplace behavior.",0,1758503801.0,careerguidance,5,0.5,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1nn98oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nn98oq/people_dont_understand_what_anxiety_is/,People don't understand what anxiety is,"I'm so damn tired of people treating anxiety like it's just being ""a little worried"" sometimes. This isn't me getting nervous before a job interview - this is my nervous system treating a trip to the grocery store like I'm about to fight a bear.

What people don't get is that anxiety rewires your entire existence. I've become a detective of my own body, constantly checking: Is my heart racing? Are my shoulders up to my ears again? Why does my stomach feel like I swallowed rocks?

I've had to become an expert in things I never wanted to know about. I know exactly which foods will send me spiraling (goodbye forever, beloved coffee). I know that fluorescent lights can trigger me. I know that certain smells or sounds can launch me into full panic mode.

The physical stuff is brutal. My body is literally falling apart - jaw constantly clenched, back full of knots, immune system destroyed. The isolation hurts more: canceling plans until friends stop inviting you, sitting in parking lots for 20 minutes to work up courage to enter a store, leaving work because normal sounds feel like torture.

**BUT** (and this is a huge but)...

I've also learned that I'm stronger than I thought. Every time I manage to do something my anxiety says is ""impossible,"" even if it's tiny, I'm building evidence that I CAN do this.

I've discovered tools that actually work for ME - not the typical ""just breathe deeply"" advice everyone gives, but my own strategies. I've learned to negotiate with my anxious brain instead of fighting against it.

Most importantly: I've realized that recovery doesn't mean ""never feeling anxious again."" It means developing confidence that I can handle whatever comes. Some days still suck, but other days I surprise myself with what I can accomplish.

To whoever's reading this and relating: you're not broken. Your brain is trying to protect you in an over-the-top way, but you can train it. It's going to take time, you'll have setbacks, but every small step counts.

1nn97zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TightPossibility5450/comments/1nn97zz/i_found_out_my_boyfriend_hates_me_by_accident/,I found out my boyfriend hates me by accident,"
A few weeks ago, my then-boyfriend and I went to visit my friends because I wanted him to meet them. It went very well; he was funny and charming, and everything was good. I was happy that he liked them and that they liked him.

One night, he and I were having some wine. I decided to go upstairs to call it a night. I went up, started reading my book, and then got a little chilly, so I went back downstairs to get my cardigan. Before I opened the door, I heard him speaking loudly (he was drunk at that point) about how he **hated** my friends, how they were so f***ing weird and disgusting, and how he thought that they were horrible people. He said that it says a lot about me because they are my best friends.

Then he said he feels trapped and that he can't be himself around me. Then he begs his friend to come visit over the weekend he goes please I need some semblance of normalcy.

Mind you, this shattered me. I mean you don’t have to like my friends that’s okay maybe you didn’t want to tell me because you didn’t want to hurt my feelings but then going and saying oh I’m trapping him WTF!!!!!!

The next day comes I say hey do you feel like you can’t talk to me? Do you feel like you can’t be yourself around me? He says NO to both he goes what’s with the weird line of questioning I said I just wanted to make sure you are comfortable enough to tell me when you're upset about something he was like I’m not upset about anything. I stay quiet cut to Friday his friend shows up I welcome him we have a great night Friday there are some laughs I think to myself okay he has his friend over we are having a good time maybe what he said was while he was drunk in a moment of I don’t f***ing know drunkness.

Anyway I wake up the next morning I go to my boyfriend's room and I ask him do you want breakfast he says yes then I said wanna come get it with me he says no. I ask okay what do you want me to get he goes sausages bacon and a sandwich I said so you want them together in the sandwich or separate he goes are you f***ing with me? Are you trying to make me angry? I got uhhh no I’m just confused on what you want he goes I want butter then I go what then he’s like omg then I was like okay you know what text me what you want I go downstairs ask his friend he doesn't want anything so I leave get the food go to the kitchen put the kettle on so when he comes downstairs there is already hot water so he can make what he wants coffee or tea I text saying breakfast is downstairs he comes downstairs says you are the worst f***ing girlfriend ever I’m like ??????? His friend was in the f***ing kitchen as well! He goes how many times have I bought you food to your room mind you I didn’t know that’s what he wanted. I would have done it if he’d asked!!! Then before he leaves he goes suck my a** his friend laughs and goes that’s a power move.

Anyway I am shocked and I’m like WTF then he proceeds to stonewall me for two days tonight he is drunk with his friend and he has been talking shit mind you my room is right above the kitchen so if I listen in I could make out what they are saying and this two face a**hole did not hold back he talked about how much he finds me boring how everyone I make a joke he forces himself to laugh then his friend goes you should record a laugh track and play it back when she makes a joke. He laughs then he goes oh my god and her breath is so atrocious it smells like someone died in there. His friend laughs then his friend says oh but like 4 times a week is still a win tho. Then he says oh I’m gonna try to fix things tomorrow with her. I’ve already blocked him and called my friends told them then I cried then I was like f*** him then I cried again and now I’m raging online because I don’t know what the f*** to do tomorrow I feel hurt betrayed and like a piece of s**t.

Hoping to meet someone who'd also like to develop chemistry over a cuddle and a conversation. It's been a long few weeks and I've been having some trouble sleeping over work, recent events, and life all together. Being lonely is nothing new so I'm challenging myself to connect with other lovely folk and talk about anything that comes up. There's something deeply fulfilling about prospering from one another's presence and dialogue. I've also found to connect deeply with others through the means of massaging. It's a very profound experience to have and I found myself opening up more to the idea of relieving others of their stress to be satisfying for both parties!

About me: 28, 5'6"", latino, i thoroughly enjoy exercising, watching and identifying birds, jazz clubs, museum visitations, and movie watching. I'm in Brooklyn (can't host, unfortunately), but can easily make my way to you or a place to meetup. I'd love to talk over a sip or a coffee/tea. Feel free to ask any questions.

I'd be willing to travel after we talk a bit and you can host. :)

**During the night, a stranger approaches my door. I peep through the door and speak with the person on the other side. After having no reasonable suspicion of them I decide to...**

Let them in? Without any sort of check? This is a bit silly as the current state of the game doesn't allow you to reasonably determine someone is or is not a visitor at the door. Simple fix - add one check per night through the door per Visit. This point is inarguably one of the most critical things this game is lacking. The game itself acknowledges this is possible >!as the Maniac with the rifle checks us for one symptom twice in the game. More about this in the No, I'm Not a Visitor section. !<

This is the primary message of this post and should be what you decide your vote on - Upvote if you agree with this idea, Downvote if you disagree with this idea. Everything else, take it or leave it - discuss it below in the comments and I will discuss it with you as well.

# No, I'm Not in your System

**ForRest - a Once per day Delivery of Yummy Goodies, whatever you need!**

Change the system to work to once per night order as stated, or just change the dialogue to once every two days so players don't waste their time calling once a day to realize supposedly they already made an order today. I lean towards the latter as it is clear the developers balanced around the deliveries only being available every few days. A slight description of what each item does to the order menu would be appreciated, again to help the new player experience and overall clarify things.

# No, I'm Not a Visitor

**My hands tremble as I lean over the sink, I couldn't be a visitor - right? The only way to know... I look in the mirror at my eyes.**

As it stands, I am perfectly fine >!with the player NOT being a Visitor!< and using the mirror to check ourselves for symptoms of Visitor status. I don't think checking any of these symptoms on ourselves should cost Energy. Going from the demo to the main release of the game energy has been reduced quite a lot, the expectation being to use Coffee and other such items from ForRest to compensate. New players that are curious will waste energy early checking themselves and be punished for simple curiosity. Experienced players will know how to avoid >!appearing to be a visitor to the Maniac.!< 

# No, I'm Not a Dementia Patient

**I speak to the Visitor at my door, I don't trust him so I tell him to go away but he offered me something to stay. Wait, what did he offer me to stay?**

When someone attempts to bribe you at the door and you are clicking fast to skip through dialogues, you don't see what the item you would receive is on the same screen as the decision. Just a simple addition of ""Accept Bribe: (Item Name)"" would be a major improvement without much effort. I understand wanting to dissuade speedrunning through dialogue but the very nature of replayable games is knowing what dialogue is skippable and the dialogue as you dismiss a visitor is exactly that. You've already chosen to not let this person in, why would you be reading what they say every time?

# No, I'm Not Replacing my People

**A couple came to my door, the man was suspicious but I felt fear for his wife who was unable to bring herself to speak. I tried to let them in, but he says his wife ""Can't stand kids"" and they won't come in if she stays.**

I'm aware this is a slot issue, as characters have a spot they are identified as ""taking up"" but when you have people inside your building that have been confirmed or at least checked in some way as opposed to the person at the door - why would you EVER allow the person at the door inside. Stochastically speaking, this only improves the chance that you allow a Visitor into your home and are punished - especially in this provided scenario >!as the Neighbors Daughter is always a human!< A social deduction game where there is no deduction to be had is a failure - when this dialogue is triggered, allow a second check at the door as described in the No, I'm Not an Idiot section. This means you will have checked this person twice and have a much better grasp of whether you should swap out someone currently inside your home.

# No, I'm Not a Game Developer

**Python? C++? Java? What on earth are you yapping about. Just get to the point lil bro.**

I understand changes take time to implement and corrections will likely be made to the game but as it is, the game just isn't enjoyable to play. Sorry. Hate to say it. I love deduction games like Gnosia, Town of Salem, so on so forth. These other games just do it better currently BUT with the changes (especially No, I'm Not an Idiot - the main section of this discussion, if you judge this post judge it on the merit of that segment. Critical discussion in the comments is greatly encouraged and questions may be answered by me if you have them depending on if I know.) The vision is entirely here, the concept is practically FLAWLESS. The world is on fire, its the literal end of the world. Now, the developers just need to execute a few more things to make it truly perfect.

God, lets talk about it... Randomization... A true blessing of technology but also the curse and bane of this games concept. Not knowing who and who is not a Visitor is very good, I like it but right now we have zero information on whether someone at our door is a bad Visitor or a regular human. During the demo, characters were preset to certain ""roles"" which allowed you to pick and choose who you wanted inside with 100% consistency to get certain endings. While I think randomization has a higher ceiling for potential in making a replayable game, the current systems don't allow us as the players to make educated decisions during gameplay. 

Anyway, thats all I can think of for this post. Love the game, love the devs, keep up the great work and lets make the game as good as it can be!",2,1758503579.0,ImNotAHuman,1,1.0,False

1nn94c7,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1nn94c7/finding_out_he_hates_me_by_accident/,Finding out he hates me by accident,"I NEED ADVICE!
A few weeks ago, my then-boyfriend and I went to visit my friends because I wanted him to meet them. It went very well; he was funny and charming, and everything was good. I was happy that he liked them and that they liked him.

One night, he and I were having some wine. I decided to go upstairs to call it a night. I went up, started reading my book, and then got a little chilly, so I went back downstairs to get my cardigan. Before I opened the door, I heard him speaking loudly (he was drunk at that point) about how he **hated** my friends, how they were ""so fucking weird and disgusting,"" and how he thought they were horrible people. He said that it says a lot about me because they are my best friends.

Then he said he feels trapped and that he can't be himself around me. He begged his friend to come visit that weekend, saying, ""Please, I need some semblance of normalcy.""

Mind you, this shattered me. You don't have to like my friends—that's okay. Maybe you didn't want to tell me because you didn't want to hurt my feelings. But then to go and say I'm *trapping* him? WTF!

The next day, I asked him, ""Do you feel like you can't talk to me? Do you feel like you can't be yourself around me?"" He said **no** to both. He asked, ""What's with the weird line of questioning?"" I said, ""I just wanted to make sure you are comfortable enough to tell me when you're upset about something."" He replied, ""I'm not upset about anything."" I stayed quiet.

Cut to Friday: his friend shows up. I welcome him, and we have a great night. There are some laughs. I think to myself, ""Okay, he has his friend over, we are having a good time. Maybe what he said was just because he was drunk in a moment of... I don't fucking know... drunkenness.""

I wake up the next morning and go to my boyfriend's room. I ask him, ""Do you want breakfast?"" He says, ""Yes."" I ask, ""Wanna come get it with me?"" He says, ""No."" I ask, ""Okay, what do you want me to get?"" He says, ""Sausages, bacon, and a sandwich."" I ask, ""So do you want them together in the sandwich or separate?"" He goes, ""Are you fucking with me? Are you trying to make me angry?"" I said, ""Uhhh, no, I'm just confused on what you want."" He says, ""I want butter."" I said, ""What?"" and he replied, ""OMG."" I said, ""Okay, you know what? Text me what you want.""

I go downstairs and ask his friend if he wants anything; he doesn't. So I leave, get the food, go to the kitchen, and put the kettle on so that when he comes down, there is already hot water for him to make coffee or tea. I text him, ""Breakfast is downstairs."" He comes down and says, **""You are the worst fucking girlfriend ever.""** (His friend was in the kitchen, too!). He continued, ""How many times have I bought you food to your room?"" Mind you, I didn't know that's what he wanted. I would have done it if he'd asked!!!

Then, before he leaves, he says, ""Suck my ass."" His friend laughs and says, ""That's a power move.""

Anyway, I am shocked and I'm like, WTF? He then proceeded to stonewall me for two days.

Tonight, he is drunk with his friend. Since my room is right above the kitchen, I could make out what they were saying if I listened in. This two-faced asshole did not hold back. He talked about how much he finds me boring, how he forces himself to laugh at every joke I make. His friend said, ""You should record a laugh track and play it back when she makes a joke."" He laughed and then said, ""Oh my god, and her breath is so atrocious; it smells like someone died in there."" His friend laughed and said, ""Oh, but like, four times a week is still a win, though."" Then he said, ""Oh, I'm gonna try to fix things tomorrow with her.""

I've already blocked him and called my friends and told them everything. Then I cried. Then I was like, ""Fuck him!"" Then I cried again. And now I'm raging online because I don't know what the fuck to do tomorrow.

I feel hurt, betrayed, and like a piece of shit.

Oh, I can't believe I didn't say this: he also said, **""I told her I loved her; I wish I could take it back.""**

Absolutely LOVED this game and beat it at around 120 hours of playtime. I had a blast playing but I won’t lie that towards the end I was itching to finish. Now that I’m actually done a part of me wants to play again but another part of me wants to take a break. I’ve been playing every single day/night for a while now. 
That being said, I feel like this game really benefits from a second playthrough that I’m excited to give it eventually after a break. Has Coffee Stain mentioned anything about giving the game new features? Would love to come back and play after another major update but I know 1.0 & 1.1 were pretty big already.

My dad lives 20 mins east of me, and my sister lives 30 mins west of me. I am in the middle. I see them about once/month, we’re not that close but my sister has a baby the same age as mine so I try to make it work. 

The plan was lunch at 12pm at a coffee shop near my house. This worked for me because I’d be able to get home for my baby’s nap and not worry about him falling asleep in the car since it’s only 10 mins west of me. I also know the coffee shop, it’s pretty quick and my baby does well there. 

I’m 5 mins from the coffee shop in bumper to bumper traffic from a bad traffic light, and my sister texts saying the coffee shop is closed. There’s a diner across the street from it so I text back saying let’s meet at the diner instead, I’m almost there. My dad texts back saying let’s meet at Panera 20 minutes west of where we were all already at. I say why not the diner? It’s right here. My sister says yes Panera sounds great see you soon. It’s on her way home so it’s fine for her. The light turns green and I have to make a snap decision of whether to drive to Panera and make it into a 30 min trip, definitely ruining my baby’s next nap, or just say sorry I can’t do that and go to the diner by myself or go home.

And I knew I was going out for a pound of chicken wings and beer for the football games and I budgeted that in. Non breaded, low cal sauce with a couple pints. 

Then, I got in a fight with my boyfriend, I went to a pub alone where I then ordered 2 more pints and they had half price food so I then ordered fucking chicken quesdillas.
