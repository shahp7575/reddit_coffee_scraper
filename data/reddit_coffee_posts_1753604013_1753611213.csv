***Chapter 1:*** **Strawberry Cake and Bad Ideas**

Alice always said she wanted a quiet, ordinary life.

Not a *boring* life—just one with warm blankets, decent grades, and maybe a strawberry cake on Sundays. But life, as it turns out, didn’t care much for her wishlist. Because right now, Alice was standing on a bridge in her school uniform, wondering if she could sell a kidney and survive on crackers for the rest of her existence.

“Do you even *need* both kidneys?” she mumbled, chewing the end of a pencil she definitely wasn’t supposed to be chewing. Her suitcase sat beside her like a silent, disappointed companion.

Everything had happened so fast. Debt collectors. Her father’s pitiful text (“Sorry, kiddo, I messed up again.”). The landlord yelling. And now, here she was. Officially homeless.

“I could live under a bench,” she muttered. “Me and pigeons. Pigeons are cool.”

She kicked a pebble off the bridge and pulled her phone out, only to find it had gone dark. Battery dead. Of course.

Just as she flopped dramatically against the rail, something slipped out of her pocket. A folded, yellowing piece of paper she hadn’t remembered packing. It fluttered in the breeze before she snatched it.

“Huh?” She unfolded it slowly.

It was a letter.

In neat, cursive handwriting:

*To my sweet Alice,*

*If you’re reading this, it means the world’s given you a bit of trouble. I left something behind for you—a little odd, a little old, but it might just save you. The key is in the glovebox. Go to the address below.*

*Love, Grandpa.*

Alice stared.

Her grandfather had passed away two years ago. He’d been a kind man with too many tools and a fascination for making blueberry scones without measuring anything. She blinked at the paper, heart pounding with a mix of disbelief and something like hope.

“…This is either going to be magical or super sketchy,” she muttered, stuffing the letter into her bag. “But it’s better than selling my organs.”

It turned out the address was a half-abandoned lot at the edge of town.

Weeds sprouted from cracked pavement. An old trailer sat in the corner, but beside it—glinting faintly in the sunset—was a… food truck?

It was white and mint green with faded stickers shaped like macarons and a flickering sign that read:

**Sweet Stop! (Now Accepting Multi-Currency!)**

“…Multi-currency?” Alice echoed. “What does that even mean?”

“Wha—oof!” She face-planted onto a floor that smelled like vanilla and old lemon polish.

Alice had once sat at her grandfather’s feet as a kid, wide-eyed and convinced magic was real.

“Back when I was your age,” Grandpa Noah used to say, “I crossed a sea made of stardust and traded cookies with a cyclops for cinnamon.”

As a child, Alice believed every word. As a teen? Not so much.

She used to laugh them off. “Sure, Grandpa,” she’d say, rolling her eyes, “and next you’re going to tell me the moon has a bakery.”

But now, standing in front of a truck that smelled like sugar and rainbows, she wasn’t sure if he’d been joking after all.

And then… the door creaked open.

She stepped inside carefully. The interior was warm, dimly lit by a cozy amber glow. Cupcake-shaped knobs. A chalkboard menu covered in smudged writing. Strange ingredients she couldn’t pronounce sat in jars behind the counter.

“Okay. Weird, but not scary,” Alice muttered.

Then the lights flickered.

And a voice growled:

**“INTRUDER. UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY. VACATE THE VEHICLE IMMEDIATELY.”**

Alice froze.

“Wha—Hello??” she said, spinning around.

No one.

Another gust of wind slammed the door shut behind her.

**“YOU HAVE TEN SECONDS TO COMPLY.”**

“Is this place haunted?!” Alice squeaked.

Utensils rattled. The blender turned on by itself.

Screaming, she bolted out of the food truck like a squirrel escaping a vacuum cleaner.

“NOPE! NOPE! NOPE!” she cried, running straight back to the street.

She didn’t stop until she was back under a streetlamp, panting and soaked.

And just as the universe loved comedic timing—it started to rain.

“Of course it does,” Alice muttered, shivering.

Her uniform clung to her, and her suitcase was now half-soaked. A man across the street leered at her a little too long. Another passed by and muttered something she didn’t catch but didn’t like.

Her stomach growled. Her knees hurt.

She had no money.

No place to go.

No backup plan.

Alice stared at the sidewalk, then up at the stormy sky.

“…I am not going to die because of a talking blender,” she whispered.

She gasped in a deep breath and spun around.

“Okay, ghost truck. Round two.”

She marched back through the lot. The rain slicked her hair to her face, but she didn’t care.

The truck door opened again, slowly, ominously.

**“WARNING. YOU ARE TRESPASSING—”**

“SHUT IT!” Alice shouted. “I *own* you!”

She stormed inside, grabbed a salt shaker off the counter, and began flinging it around.

“YOU HEAR ME?! GRANDPA NOAH LEFT YOU TO ME! I CLAIM YOU IN THE NAME OF—OF—I DUNNO, FAMILY LEGACY!”

The air whooshed and something invisible zoomed past her ear.

Alice threw more salt.

“GET SALTED, POLTERGEIST!” she yelled.

A faint cough. A sputter.

And then—hovering up from behind the counter—came the ghost.

Small. Round. Slightly translucent. Wearing an apron.

“…You’re Alice?” he asked, blinking behind his tiny spectacles.

Alice froze mid-salt toss.

“Duh?” she said, hair dripping.

The ghost gave a tired sigh.

“Well, that explains the dramatics.”

Alice stared at him.

“I can see you. You’re a ghost,” she said, her voice inching up an octave. “Like, you’re *floating*. You just threw a spoon at me. This is not normal.”

“Technically I nudged it with energy,” Nico replied flatly.

Alice looked ready to bolt again.

“Breathe,” he said, and before she could panic further—he shoved a hard candy into her mouth.

She choked.

“Wha—*HACKK*—what was that?!” she coughed, doubling over.

“Chamomile sugar drop. Calms the nerves,” Nico said, folding his tiny arms.

“You almost *killed* me with candy!” she wheezed.

“You’re welcome.”

Alice slumped onto one of the diner-style stools, glaring at him between coughs.

“Okay. Ghost. Who are you, and why are you haunting this weirdly adorable sugar truck?”

“My name is Nico,” he said simply. “And I am *not* haunting the truck. I’m guarding it—from thieves, looters, squatters…” His eyes narrowed at her. “…and random teens with no boundaries.”

Alice’s jaw dropped.

“Excuse me?! Do I *look* like a criminal to you?”

“Well, statistically speaking, you broke in, yelled at me, and threw condiments everywhere.”

“I was defending myself from *poltergeist terrorism!*”

Nico sighed again and floated down behind the counter.

“For what it’s worth… I used to run this truck with your grandfather, Noah. He and I were business partners. For centuries.”

“…Centuries?” Alice asked, blinking. “Like, plural?”

“Yes,” Nico said. “We traveled across dimensions, sold food to all kinds of travelers, hunted monsters for rare ingredients. It was a good life. Until one fateful day… he met someone here. A normal human. Fell in love. Decided to stay.”

Alice went quiet, hands resting on the counter.

“…That sounds like him,” she said softly.

“He gave up the truck. Settled down. Grew old. It happens.” Nico floated up again, his expression unreadable.

“And now it seems… he’s passed it on to you.”

Alice blinked at him. “This whole truck traveled through dimensions… and sold cupcakes?”

“Well, cupcakes, ice cream, stardust pudding, phoenix flan, soul-flavored éclairs—variety is important,” Nico replied with a matter-of-fact nod.

Alice rubbed her temples. “You’re telling me my grandpa was some kind of sugar-slinging dimensional merchant ninja?”

“Yes,” Nico said. “With a tendency to leave flour in places flour should not be.”

Alice stood up and began walking slowly through the truck. The back was lined with small drawers, mysterious ingredients in vacuum jars, a tiny freezer that smelled faintly like mint and ozone. Everything looked half-magical and half-messy, like a wizard’s coffee shop.

She pulled a heavy old book off the shelf behind the register.

**“The Infinite Ingredient: A Guide to Sweets Across the Stars”**

She flipped through it.

There were diagrams of desserts she’d never seen before: floating jelly spheres that glowed like fireflies, cookies with tiny meteor cores, cakes shaped like pocket dimensions. One recipe was titled *“Molten Mischief Macarons (Handle With Tongs).”* Another simply said *“Don’t Bake This. Ever.”*

“Grandpa really *was* nuts,” she murmured, eyes wide.

Nico floated closer. “The moment Noah passed… the magic left the truck.” He gestured to the rusting counter, the cracked vinyl seat. “It aged, just like he did.”

Alice closed the cookbook gently. Her hand left a faint warm print on the cover.

Nico tilted his head. “…But you’re his blood. That means—you might be able to bring it back.”

Alice stared at him. “What, me? No. Nooo. That’s not—”

She waved her arms. “I don’t *have* magic! I mean, one time I tried to talk to a chicken because I thought I was a druid? It pecked me on the nose and pooped on my shoes.”

She started pacing. “Another time I stood in front of a mirror for five hours waiting for my magical reflection twin to show up. Nothing.”

She held up a finger. “AND I once swallowed glitter because I thought maybe sparkles would give me fairy powers.”

Nico stared. “…Did it?”

“No! I glitter-sneezed for a week.”

He floated a little higher, watching her.

“But you’re here now. You found the letter. The truck let you in.”

Alice frowned, uncertain.

“Maybe the magic’s been waiting,” Nico said, a little quieter now. “And maybe… so have we.”

He hovered in thoughtful silence for a moment before turning around. “Come with me.”

Alice followed him to the front of the truck.

“This,” Nico said, pointing at the dusty, cracked steering wheel, “is your trial. Simple. Turn the key.”

Alice raised a brow. “That’s it?”

“If you can’t start the truck,” Nico explained, “then maybe the magic’s not there. If you can… then it’s yours.”

She eyed the ignition like it might bite her. “And if it explodes?”

“Then we’ll both go out in style.”

Alice sighed and slid into the driver’s seat. It felt weirdly heavy—like the cushions were full of ancient marshmallows.

She grabbed the key.

Twisted.

The truck let out a cough. A whir. A faint glow sparkled across the dashboard—and then silence.

“…Well,” she mumbled, letting go. “Guess I’m just a glitter-sneezer, not a mage.”

But Nico zipped in front of her. “No! Try again. It moved. That’s more than anyone’s done in years.”

She hesitated, eyes narrowing at the key. “Fine,” she muttered, gripping it tighter.

This time she gritted her teeth and turned it with all her strength.

The engine gave a sharp chime—*DING!*—and lights blinked to life. The walls hummed. The pastel paint of the food truck looked just a bit less faded. The scent of strawberries filled the air.

Alice blinked in awe.

“…Whoa.”

Nico twirled in midair. “Welcome back, Sweet Stop.”

Alice remained frozen in the seat, still gripping the key.

“Did I just… do magic?”

“Technically, yes,” Nico said, floating beside her with a proud puff of his ghostly chest. “Basic ignition magic tied to spiritual compatibility. Nothing too flashy, but still impressive for a beginner.”

As Alice leaned back, trying to process everything, a soft chime echoed through the air—like a bell crossed with a sparkle—and suddenly, a glowing HUD shimmered into view above the dashboard.

“Wha—okay what is *that*?!” Alice pointed at the floating screen.

It was semi-transparent and softly glowing with pastel colors. In cursive font, it read:

**Sweet Stop: Magical Mobile Unit** **Current Owner: Alice** **Bright**

**Truck Level: 1** 

**Power Source: 3%** 

**Kitchen Functions: Limited** **World Access (Locked**)

**Customer Rating: N/A**

“Hey! That’s me!” she said, pointing to her name.

Nico squinted at it. “Ah, yes. With the designation of a new keyholder, the Sweet Stop resets to Level 1. Functional, but limited. No dimension-hopping until we get it back in shape.”

“Level 1?!” Alice gasped. “You mean there’s grinding in ghost food trucks too?”

Nico nodded. “You’ll need to level it up by gaining experience—serving customers, collecting ingredients, repairing equipment… and possibly fending off hungry gremlins.”

Alice slumped back in her seat, muttering, “I just wanted strawberry cake and a nap.”

Me and my partner have a coffee shop business po. The problem is, the landlord didn’t disclose that there are leaks in almost every corner of the place, coming from upstairs. Walang waterproofing. She promised us na ipapaayos niya ito before the rainy season, so we agreed. Ang sabi lang niya noon, sa CR lang may leak.

But now, our lights aren’t working anymore because of the leaks. Sumabog na rin yung ilaw sa CR. May mga leaks sa circuit. We haven’t been able to operate for several weeks dahil sobrang delikado, kahit anong punas namin, madulas pa rin ang tiles. When we came back, sobrang dami ring molds.

We signed a contract, pero hindi niya kami binigyan ng copy. We’ve been trying to reach out to her through text pero hindi siya nagre-reply. Pinuntahan na rin namin siya sa bahay pero palagi siyang wala. Her approach before was kinda rude rin.

We’re planning to request for the return of the 2-month advance (₱16,000) since naapektuhan talaga ang operations namin and there were a lot of damages. Ang dami naming pinaayos sa shop, only to find out ganito pala kalala yung situation. We’re not expecting na ibabalik niya since advance payment na nga yun, but the place is no longer habitable and safe to stay in.

May laban po ba kami if we bring this to the barangay? Hoping to seek advice po. :(",1,1753610861.0,Renters,0,1.0,False

1maim7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1maim7w/my_gerd_is_getting_better/,My GERD is getting better,"My GERD is getting better. I have been off PPI meds for about four weeks now. Little to no rebound reflux. I believe I'm well and truly past rebound reflux based on the time I was on PPIs.

Some things I've done, which is what my doctor has told me forever.

- got my bowels moving more often than ever, and focused on healthy looking BM over regularity. 

- Seeing a counsellor about some mental health issues.  

- Doing something just for me. I'm learning to drive and starting online school.

- eating mostly whole, unprocessed food. Treats are small portions. 

- warm chamomile tea when i want a nice hot drink, and coffee sparingly.  

- listening to my body. Sometimes I'll wait until I'm hungry to eat. Sometimes I'll eat something small to calm ""gastritis prangs""

- walking at least 6km a week or more (I do this at the gym 2x half hour sessions) I find excersise helps me calm my reflux without needing OTC antacids on a bad flare day too. 

- early dinner and dessert and waiting at least 3 hours before going to bed.

 This has been a game changer. The damage from the night reflux was setting me up for an angry GI system the following day. I can't stress that enough. 

Finally, removing as much gluten from my diet as possible. I eat corn crackers instead of Sandwiches, and GF alternatives now. If I have to eat bread it's Sourdough. It really is alot more gentle on my tum. Cutting gluten settled my chest GERD symptoms within a few days. I find the overall bloating is reduced and I feel lighter, keeping acid out of my esophagus. 

 It's taken me two years to change my lifestyle consistently enough to see a difference. The small changes were helping me, even if they didn't feel like it in the moment. 

I hope this helps someone. ",2,1753610711.0,GERD,0,1.0,False
1maim5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1maim5j/beauty_and_the_beta/,Beauty And The Beta,"# Chapter 1 Bailey

I looked at the clock on my bedroom wall. I think I have delayed the inevitable for as long as I physically can. I should go to the packhouse to go and wish our pack's upcoming Alpha a happy birthday. The bane of my life. My brother’s best friend. One day to be Alpha Miles. Today he will turn 17, and meet his Alpha wolf. In all honesty, he was egotistical enough, thinking the world revolved around him, without him adding to that by finally gaining his wolf. Not your run-of-the-mill werewolf either. Oh no, Miles Davenport was destined to be an Alpha, so he would have a strong and powerful Alpha wolf, only adding to his arrogance and strength.

The crazy thing is, Miles had once upon a time been one of my closet friends too. In my younger childhood... Friends, that kind of thing comes when your father is the Beta to the Alpha. The children spend a lot of time together, and become friends. My older brother, Jordan, became the wing-man to Miles. His closest friend and ally, who as his Beta when the time came, was only right. But as the years went on, the friendship between Miles and I changed.

Friendship faded as he grew into a more popular sports star of our school. At the end of the day, he was always going to be popular, he was the upcoming Alpha after all, but as one of the top sports stars too, he was idolized. As was my brother. All the girls in school flocked around them like they were pop stars or something, and it was bizarre. I was nothing more to him now but a source of amusement for him and his sports buddies. A geek. Not one of the beauty queens who followed him around. Simply someone to make fun of.

I had gone from enjoying time with my one-day Alpha, to hating him, in the space of a school year. He thought he was god’s gift, and in all honesty, if he was, he is a gift I would return…

“Bailey!” I heard my Mum call from downstairs, telling me I was definitely running it close now for time. I know Jordan had already headed over to the packhouse a while ago with my Dad to meet his friend and our Alpha.

“I know.” I yelled back, looking at the books on my desk, desperate to continue with the assignment I was working on. I would so much rather continue working on the assignment and gain the additional credit available, work toward going to the college I want to go to instead of going to a party for the big-headed bully, I got to consider almost family, considering he was the son of my Dad’s best friend.

I stood from my seat, and walked to my mirror, adjusting my black skater dress I had chosen to wear today. Something plain and simple, easy to blend into the background, but a dress all the same if anyone asked why I hadn’t made an effort. Along with my chunky black sandals, I looked presentable, not that anyone would be looking at me. Today, all eyes would be on the birthday boy, as they always were. He would make sure of that. I flicked back my curly brown hair, before I walked out of the door, already dreading the hours that lay ahead…

My Mum pulled the car into the parking spaces outside the packhouse, while my younger sister Morgan was flicking at the curls around my head, simply trying to irritate me. She knew I would rather be anywhere but here right now, and was loving every last moment of it. “Aww, you want to go home Bailey-boo?” she teased.

“Stop you two, come on, your Dad is waiting inside. Let us go and find the birthday boy.” Mum says, sounding cheerful, completely oblivious to the fact how horrendous this party had the potential to be. She, too, worshiped Miles. Having seen him grow up alongside my brother, she seemed to think the sun shone out of his rear-end. It had always driven me insane.

“He won’t even notice us there.” I muttered under my breath as I followed her up the steps of the back house, shaking my head at my sister and how overdressed she looked. She definitely looked like she was out to impress someone today. A small part of me wondered if she hoped she might be the fated mate of Miles. After all, he was meeting his Alpha wolf today. He will have shifted for the first time today, and today could potentially be the day he can sense his fated mate out there waiting for him! There had been so much buzz around school about this, so many of the girls were excited about the potential possibility they could be his fated mate. The one chosen for him by the moon goddess. The one destined to be with him. So many of them are desperate for it to be them. While there I was desperate for anything but. I could think of nothing worse! Yet, looking at the amount of effort my younger sister had made today, I am beginning to think she was one of the many she-wolves that was holding out that hope…

We walked through the corridors of the packhouse, and it was filled with various pack members. Today was a day of celebration within pack, the birthday of the upcoming Alpha. And not just any birthday, the day he came of age. The day he met his Alpha wolf. The walls of the packhouse were adorned with decorations, music was blaring from various speakers dotted around the multiple rooms.

“Ooff, sorry!” a giggling she-wolf said to me as she nearly knocked me off my feet as she knocked into me. I would rather be anywhere but here right now. This was far too hectic and far too loud for me. I simply glare at the back of the girl as she moves away from me, not a care in the world.

I followed my Mum and my sister, who was almost skipping as she walked, toward the main lounge area. I can only assume my Mum had mindlinked my Dad to let him know we had arrived, and he said they were there, or else we could spend all day looking around for them! It appeared almost every member of the pack had turned up to celebrate the birthday of Miles fucking Davenport.

The lounge area was laden with people, music truly blasting, and everyone seeming to have a good time. Everyone but me. I caught the eye of my brother, leaning against the wall of the lounge, the furthest away from the door we had just walked into. He nodded in my direction before simply turning away.

‘Could have made an effort, Bailey.’ he mindlinked. ‘It is a birthday, not a funeral, you know?’

I felt my heart sink at his words. Great, the insults were starting already, which meant it would only be a matter of time until Miles started too. The two of them seemed to like working together like that. Finding great enjoyment in harassing me. I was only a year younger than both of them, and had desperately hoped the name-calling and insulting would ease off as they got a little older, but if anything, they seemed to get worse. All because I wasn’t like the girls they were interested in, I was sure of it. I wasn’t like the other girls. Made myself an easy target, my Mum told me, all because I enjoyed studying. Liked reading and learning. Said, I only made it harder for myself. The plan was to make it easier for myself by finding a way out…

“Jordan says your dress looks like you are going to a funeral, Bailey.” Morgan teased, fluffing up my curls again. My long brown hair fell in thick, unruly curls down my back. They drove me mad at times. Especially when my brother and sister decide to mess with them.

“Oh well, I wore a dress, like you asked.” I snapped, moving away from them, feeling angry already, so tempted just to turn around and walk home, only to be pulled back by my Mum.

“We are going to wish Miles a happy birthday. You will stay for a while at least. I do not need to be explaining to your Aunt and Uncle yet again why you have walked out on a social event, Bailey.” Mum warned me, her tone sounding grumpy, I swear she had to have read my thoughts on leaving the party already. I am sure she hated having me as a daughter, likely wishing for one that was more sociable, and one that enjoyed being a part of everything, instead of one that would rather have her head in a book.

“Awww, Happy Birthday, Miles!” I heard my sister squeal from by my side. I swear she spoke at a pitch so high only dogs could hear. Goddess knows why she is so excited. It is only his birthday. He likely doesn’t even care, he never normally does…

As I looked up, his blue eyes were locked on me, I raised my gaze to meet his, and could see his eyes shift to a darker blue… was that his wolf? I see a snarl across his face as he suddenly storms from the room. What the hell was that about?

‘Get out here.’ Miles is suddenly mindlinking me, and I have to say he sounded far from impressed. That, combined with the angry expression on his face, told me something was off. Would he have rather I had not come? Well, he was not the only one…

‘What?’ I questioned, completely confused. Was he annoyed over how I had dressed too? Jeez, it was just a dress. Does it really matter? I would go home if it was.

‘Outside now.’ He demanded once more, sounding even more irritated this time, making me realize I had little choice but to follow his orders, so I snuck away from the ongoing party back to the doors of the packhouse.

Only to find Miles pacing along the bottom of the steps, looking a mixture of confused and angry. So why did he need me here? Someone to take his anger out on? I was not willing to be that, I was sure about that… Just as I was about to walk away, he looked up.

“Fucking took you long enough.” He snapped.

I frowned, unsure what this was all about, but it was making no sense to me as I looked down toward him from where I stood at the top of the packhouse steps. His blue eyes shifted to the dark blue once more, like they had inside, taking me by surprise. His wolf is clearly lingering…

“What is wrong, Miles? Do you want me to get Jordan?” I asked.

“No I do not! I do not want anyone knowing this.” He snarls, a growl slipping from his lips, though whether that was aimed at me or whether his wolf was angry at him, I do not know…

“I don’t think I understand…” I began.

“You soon will.” He sneers, and I simply look to him in confusion. Nothing he says makes sense to me. Until he continues. “Only today did I realize. The thought makes me sick. Why our own moon goddess would play a trick like this on me, I don’t know. I am an Alpha. A fucking Alpha. I deserve a strong mate. A beautiful mate to be proud of. Not some feeble pathetic wallflower.”

My body trembles at his words. No. I had yet to gain my wolf. I did not know this yet. Why… Why him of all people? “I am your fated mate?” I question with a shaky voice. “Are you sure?”

“Are you fucking doubting me?” he yells. “And you won’t be. The moment you have your wolf, I will decide when the time is right to reject you.”

My heart twists and contorts at the thought. Rejection was meant to be the most painful thing possible. Why would he want to reject the mate chosen for him by our own moon goddess? Am I truly so repulsive?

# Chapter 2 Bailey

A Year Later

Yet another birthday party for our beloved upcoming Alpha. Ha. Not my beloved upcoming Alpha. I hated the fucker. Breaking my heart without a second thought. What I had done to deserve that I had never got a proper explanation from him. Other than the frequent insults, of why would he want to be with someone like me? Did I look like Luna material to him? I had no clue. What the hell did Luna material look like in his eyes? Some blond bimbo, no doubt. They were the she-wolves he tended to spend his time with within our pack. The ones who worshiped the ground he walked on. That would do anything he asked of them. Ones that I highly doubted read much more than the work set of them at school.

“Bailey!” my Mum yelled at me from the stairway of our family home. “Will you hurry up?!”

“Do I really need to come to the party?” I responded. “I am telling you, Miles will not be bothered if I am not there!”

“Your Aunt and Uncle will be though. And I am not explaining to them again why you are missing.” My Mum continues yelling. “Do you not realize just how many events you have missed this year, all because you have your head in a book?”

“Yeah Bai-Bai. Such a geek. No wonder you have no friends.” My sister Morgan giggles from outside my bedroom door.

“Piss off.” I hissed. “I have friends.”

I stormed from my room, and down the stairs toward my waiting family. I planned to greet the birthday boy, not that he would care in the slightest. I know that he would rather not see me at all. And then I would sneak home.

“Ew, are you wearing that?” Morgan asked.

I looked down at the skinny black trousers I had on and the white tank top. Great. I can’t win. Nothing I wear is approved of by my sister, evidently named the fashion queen without my knowledge. Oh well, I am dressed and wearing it. I think it looked good with my chunky black sandals I had on…

I scowled at my sister and walked out of the door. “Are we going or not?” I snapped at them all, truly not able to wait for the following month when I leave to go to university. Get away from them, and this pack!

The party was well underway when we arrived, music pounding from the speakers as couples made out in every available space, so I averted my eyes as we walked through the corridors of the packhouse to the lounge where we would no doubt find Miles reigning over his people. Being all important, like he was partial to considering himself.

‘Why are you here?’ Miles’s voice filled my mindlink, before I had even fully entered the room behind my parents.

Great. ‘I didn’t get a choice. Trust me, I would rather not be.’ I snapped back.

I was getting more than a little tired of the way he would treat me. Yes, he planned on rejecting me. Decided I was not for him, but he could have left it at that. I didn’t need treating like I was some sort of social pariah because of the fact he decided I was not right for him. I do not think I deserved that. I had endured enough bullying through my time in high school, for the fact I enjoyed my education.

‘Oh. Excuse me? Are you implying you were not going to come to the party of your next Alpha?’ Miles links with some serious attitude.

‘Miles, you just asked why I had bothered coming. Now you are asking if I was not going to come? Make your mind up.’ I argued.

‘Remember who I am Bailey. You are not above me. Never will be. Could have been equal to me at most had I seen you as suitable to be my mate, but no. You were beneath that honor.’ He sneers.

I felt anger racing through me. ‘And you think I would not have rejected you?’ I snapped, moving back toward the exit, not wanting to be here anymore. Until I felt a hand grabbing the back of my tank top, yanking me back.

My eyes darted upward to see the dark eyes of Miles. Sneering down at me. Our Pack’s upcoming Alpha. The most arrogant man I think I have ever met. One, thankfully, I did not have to be mates with any longer as the stupid fucker had chosen to reject his own fated mate before even giving her a chance. “Going somewhere Bailey?” he asked, his voice full of spite.

“Well, I do believe you asked me why I was here, so I assumed you wanted me to leave.” I told him.

Miles bows his head down so it is level with mine, he inhales deeply, like he still enjoys the scent of me. He has done this numerous times of late, which I find quite bizarre. But, I ignore him as he tilts his head to look at me, “Hmm, I think my Mum and Dad may have something to say if you leave. Their clever little Bailey. Heaven forbid.” He presses his forehead against mine. “Just stay away from me, and do not spoil my fun.”

I shake my head in disbelief at him, as he stalks away. Did he even think for a moment I would be going near him if I could avoid it? I would rather be anywhere but near him!

“Bailey, why are you harassing my friend for?” I heard my brother, Jordan demand, as he suddenly approached, causing many people to turn around and look at me. Wonderful. Nothing like starting pack gossip is there. I am sure Miles would appreciate that!

“I wasn’t harassing him, he came to speak to me. Asking why I had come.” I told him, and my brother laughed. He is as much an idiot as Miles. Any of my friends who have big brothers hate how protective they are. Me? No, my big brother is the one leading all the bullying and being a total dick to me. He finds great embarrassment in the fact his younger sister is far from being one of the popular group, and is, in his words, ‘far too into her books’. I think, in all honesty, my entire family found me, in one way or another, a huge embarrassment.

“Well, he has a point. Not like you will be joining in with the celebrations. You will probably be sitting in a quiet corner somewhere reading.” He teases.

“Well, it is certainly more intellectually pleasing than any of you would be.” I smirked at him as I walked away from my brother who was standing looking confused. I am sure he had no clue what I meant. The scary thing is he will be the next, pack Beta. Heaven help our pack. Between him and Miles they only had one brain cell between them, and that was one that they shared, I am sure of it! And even then, I think it was rechargeable and started losing power and knowledge at a rapid rate! They only graduated high school because they paid people to do their work for them.

As I snuck away, out of the busy lounge to the top of the stairway, where I hoped to hide out for as long as possible, I heard footsteps behind me. I quickly turned, hoping it was simply someone on their way to their bedroom or even to one of the spare bathrooms on this floor. But, sadly, luck was not on my side tonight. No. Miles was following me. Eyebrows raised and looking quite irritated.

“Oi. I want to talk to you.” he demanded.

“You asked me to go away a minute ago, didn’t you?” I asked him.

“Don’t think so, think it was more a case of why you were here.” Miles says with a smirk. Sitting on the top step with me.

“Miles, you have the whole pack here for your birthday, I am sure whatever you need to speak to me about can wait.” I shrugged, desperately craving peace, which, considering the pounding beat of the music playing, would be difficult.

“No. Why didn’t you tell me you were leaving?” he questions, like he is irate at the fact I had not let him know. Why would I let him know?

“Why would I? We aren’t friends, Miles. You also are not my Alpha yet. It was arranged with my parents, me and your Dad, as Alpha.” I explained to him, unsure why this would even bother him. If anything, I would think he would be glad to get rid of me.

“You are going away though.” he murmurs.

“That is generally what happens when you go to college or university. Yeah.” I said with another shrug.

“There wasn’t one closer to home?” he hisses. “Because it seems to me you picked the one furthest away.”

“What does it matter to you? You hate me. I won't be here, You get your wish of being rid of me.” I snapped, truly sick of him trying to dictate to me what I should and shouldn’t be doing. I had worked hard in school, so I could do this. My parents had spoken to my Aunt and Uncle, the Luna and Alpha of our pack to allow me special permission to go to a university out of state to study, saying it was what I had dreamed of. I had nothing holding me back. And, with the fact Miles did not want me for his mate, or his Luna, I truly did not. Not that any of them knew of that. That was our own secret.

Even despite the pull to him as my mate since my wolf had arrived, I still found him truly repulsive. He sickened me. Though, the pains when he slept with the many she-wolves that visited his bed, made it even easier to detest the man that he had become. I still had no clue what I had done to deserve this treatment from this man, other than not being one of the popular group. But, I knew I deserved better than him.

Miles glanced at me, momentarily a thoughtful look passed over his face, almost caring, before a hardness replaced it. “That much is true. No more having to see the disappointing failure the moon goddess made of mating me to you. At least not for a few years. Who knows, perhaps you will meet someone while there. I suggest you do. That way you won’t have to come back, because, I, as Alpha, will be looking for my Luna.”

“Miles, I honestly do not care if you find someone else.” I told him, going to stand and head home, not wishing to spend another moment in the same place as him.

As I went to move away, he grabbed my hand, pulling me to him, so I was once more sitting level with him on the top step of the first floor landing of our packhouse. “Always so righteous aren’t you Bailey? You say you don’t care? We will see. Well, this will be on my terms. I, Miles Davenport, reject you, Bailey West, as my fated mate…” he began, and my head began to whirl as his words sunk in. The realization and excruciating pain of what was happening becoming too much for me…

# Chapter 3 Bailey

Three Years Later

I drove the long road down to pack. I hated this drive. It was like returning to hell for me. Lotus Shadow Pack. My very own version of hell. Though, three years away, studying had been truly amazing. Transforming myself into the woman I should always have been. Confident. Self-assured. Brave. Just me. And now a fully qualified teacher.

As a she-wolf, you spend so many years of your life being told your focus is finding your fated mate. Settling down with them and creating a strong matebond. A love. A family. Well, once I had come to accept that my naïve, teenage dreams would never surface, thanks to the moon goddess pairing me with a mate so incapable of loving anyone other than himself, I decided that my focus would be my career. My education had always been something I took great pride in. I loved to learn, and I had decided that I wanted to pass that gift along. I no longer cared what others thought of me. And, while at university, it felt so wonderful to be surrounded by others who felt the same way. I finally felt like I fit in somewhere.

And, I believe that is what allowed me to become the person I was meant to be. However, now, I had to return to my pack, at their orders. The agreement was, once I had completed my degree, I would return home. Unless, of course, I had found my fated mate. But, I knew within my heart, that was never to happen. For, my fated mate sat at home. Lording it over our pack. Acting like he was the best thing since sliced bread. Sleeping with any she-wolf that came near him, from what I heard, having rejected me.

I pulled up at our guarded pack gates. Harley, one of our pack warriors, currently on guard duty, stepped forward to my car window. “ID” he ordered.

I frowned at him. I do not think I have been asked for ID before when returning home, even in all the times I have visited home, though in all fairness, those visits have been few and far between. My visits were only when they were required of me. I had grown to loathe this place, and coming back had become less of a priority for me over the time I was away...

“Harley, it is me. Bailey.” I explained, trying not to smile at his mistake.

Harley looked at me closer. “Shit. Sorry Bailey, didn’t really recognize you there. You changed your hair. And you aren’t wearing your glasses. You look good.” He says with a shrug, quickly looking away, clearly embarrassed by his faux-pas.

I smirk at his response. Yes, my hair is somewhat tamer than it used to be. The curls straightened out, and my hair now neat and sleek down my back. My glasses I had worn for reading had been long gone. Having got my eyes fixed with laser eye surgery whilst away. Plus, I now wore a little simple make-up to accentuate my features. Nice to know somebody has noticed a difference…

“No problem. You still need ID?” I asked him.

He grins at me. “I think I know who you are. Nice to see you.” he nods at me in acknowledgment as the gate opens for me. “Maybe catch you around while you are back.” He adds as I begin to drive away.

I smiled in response, I guess there would be nothing to stop me catching up with any guy I wanted to now. Not that I was really bothered right now... but it was not like I had a fated mate to wait for any longer. And it wasn’t like Miles was making a point of staying single. Every time I had returned home, he had had a different she-wolf on his arm. Parading them through pack like a prized possession, only to have traded her in by the time I returned on my next visit. He was turning into quite the lothario. And quite a joke in my eyes.

I set off along the quiet, familiar roads of our sweet old pack. The evening sun was settling in the sky as I moved my car down the route to my family home. No doubt my Mum would be there waiting for me, perhaps my Dad, if he was in from work by now. My brother and sister, I was unsure. They still both lived at home with my parents, but were back and forth to friends' homes and my brother was looking to move into the Beta suite in the packhouse soon enough, in preparation for taking on the role from my father when the time came. Either way, they rarely bothered to rush home to see me when they knew I was returning. I don’t think seeing me was at the top of their priority list…

I pulled my car up on the street in front of my familiar family home. I could not believe I was home. Stuck back here. The dread within my stomach churned heavily at the prospect of many years stuck here. Miserable and unhappy, with no way out, now my fated mate had rejected me. Not that anyone other than Miles and I knew of that. No. He had decided he would be considered weak if others knew an Alpha had gone against the powerful Moon Goddess’s choice. So, this was our secret. Or he would make me pay in ways I did not want to imagine, apparently.

And, in all honesty, I did not want to think of it. He had allowed me to go away to do my degree. Doing the final bit of convincing when my Uncle, the current Alpha, and Miles’s father, along with my parents were on the fence. Or, so he said. How true that was, I would never likely know the truth, but it had been for that reason, and that alone I had chosen to do as he had asked.

If he had done the things he said, then he had allowed me to fulfill my dream of gaining my degree of teaching away from pack. To allow me to be just me, not the daughter of the pack Beta. And I have thrived because of it. But, now, I had to return. Back to where I belonged. And, while I may have gained my degree, I had no real future prospects. I was likely stuck here.

I stepped from the car, determined more than ever to find work, as I heard my Mum’s voice. “Bailey!” she greeted me from the porch steps, a big smile upon her face. “You look beautiful sweetheart.”

I smiled back at her, as I moved toward the front door. Only to see Miles leaving the house next door to ours. The Alpha home. Could I have timed my arrival home any worse?

His eyes met mine, giving me a dark stare before looking at my Mum. “Hi Aunt Brianna. You didn’t say she was home today.”

Mum smiled at Miles like she thought the world of him, though most of the time she generally did. “Ah, I think it slipped my mind. Bailey is home for good now, Miles. How wonderful is that?”

Once more, Miles gave me a dark stare. “Hmmm. Truly wonderful.” he said with some serious contempt in his voice.

‘You stay out of my way unless I say otherwise, you understand?’ Miles mindlinks me, as he moves toward his car.

“Are you not going to speak to him Bai?” Mum tries. “He will be Alpha this time next year, you know?”

“Oh it doesn’t matter, Aunt Brianna. Bailey will be excused this time. I am sure she is tired from her drive back home. But no doubt I will be seeing her around. And yes, she will have to get used to me as her senior. Her Alpha.” He says with a sneer, and at his words my stomach twists into knots. I don’t think I can stay here… I not only need to find work, I need to find work away from my pack, so I can move away to get away from my psychotic Alpha and ex-mate!

# Chapter 4 Bailey

I sit out in the garden drinking my morning coffee, with my laptop open scrolling desperately through the job vacancies, when I hear a deep growl to my left, causing me to swirl my head to look. Miles was resting his head on the garden fence from next door, overlooking our back garden, to where I was sitting. Watching me intently, the look upon his face was one of sheer disgust...

I had no clue how long he had been standing there, or what had angered him to the point of growling, but he had made me jump. “Fucking hell, Miles.” I snapped, giving him a dark scowl. I had done well the past week since arriving and stayed out of his way. Managing to ensure I avoided all pack events, and ensuring I dodged any places he was likely to be. Yes, it meant I spent an awful lot of time in my bedroom at home, but I would rather do that than have to deal with him.

Today, the sun was glorious, and I thought it would be nice to take my breakfast outside while I looked for jobs online. Sitting on the patio furniture we have in the back garden, under the warmth of the morning sunshine, my coffee was enjoyable, all until this stupid fucker disturbed me. I shook my head in his direction, wondering why he had snuck up on me. He had so many more places he could be...

“Who do you think you are cursing at?” Miles snarled.

“The creep who did exactly that. Crept up on me out of the blue for no good reason.” I rolled my eyes at him in disgust, only to see this seemed to anger him further. Though, I think anything I did would anger Miles. He seemed to hold some serious resentment towards me at the moment, but should I really expect anything less?

“I will come over there and deal with you, Bailey.” He hissed.

“Deal with me?” I questioned his choice of words. “Deal with me how? You asked me to stay out of your way. That is what I am doing.”

“What are you doing?” he chose to ignore my words, and looks to my laptop screen instead, so I slowly shut the screen down, so he would be unable to see. I do not want him knowing I am applying for work outside the area. I would not put it past him to stop it from happening. He seems to be being deliberately nasty of late, so I truly do not know what he would sink to, in order to be nasty towards me…

“Nothing of your concern.”

“I am your Alpha. So, all that goes on in my pack is my business.” He tells me with a smirk.

I shook my head with a smirk back, “Hmm, not quite Miles, you are not. Your Dad is still Alpha, so don’t be getting ahead of yourself.”

An angry look flared across his face once more. His handsome features contorted in fury. He did not like having people disagree with him. But I was not about to have him dictating to me...

“Just because you were my mate once upon a time does not give you the right to talk to me however you please, you know.” Miles snarls.

“She is your mate?” a voice questions, causing us both to whip our heads round, only to see the unexpected face of Miles’s younger brother Ellis.

I look at Miles with despair now, my heart pounding within my chest and my palms becoming sweaty. Wondering what the hell he planned to do now the secret we had kept between us for so long was out now… how had neither of us heard him coming?

“No she is not. She rejected me.” Miles said coldly, looking at me as if daring me to disagree with him.

Wait... he was making it out like I had rejected him? I looked at Miles in shock, but the look within his eyes was like he dared me to argue.

“You rejected your Alpha? What kind of fool are you?” Ellis asked as his eyes looked me up and down like a piece of dirt. Sadly, a look I am more than used to. “Do Mum and Dad know?”

Miles shakes his head. “No. I don’t want them to either. It would worry them too much, Els, please do not say anything. Bailey and I were never a good match, so perhaps she made the right choice. Please for me?” Miles is pleading with his brother, and part of me wonders if he is worried what his family would do if they learned of his decision to go against the Moon Goddess. As an Alpha, this was almost unheard of. Blaming me was gutless. But, if that is what he wants to do, then let him.

‘Do not even think of saying anything different.’ Miles’s voice reverberates through my mind via the link. ‘Or you will learn to regret it. That degree you love so much could easily be destroyed.’

I took in the words Miles had said, and the sad thing is, I do not doubt them. I would not put it past him finding a way to have my degree removed. Having me stuck within our pack. He would be Alpha soon enough, and he would be the one able to dictate what I did... I had little choice but to do as he asked. Yet i felt anger racing through my veins...

I lifted my laptop and stood from my seat. “I will talk to you however I like Miles. When you seem to think you can treat me however you like.” and with that I walked away from the two brothers, both looking at me, walking away in shock. I know I would come to regret what I had just said, but I truly no longer cared…

# Chapter 5 Asher

I pace the corridor of the packhouse for yet another night. Sleepless nights are becoming the most repetitive thing for me now. Almost tiresome… or they would be if I could actually fucking sleep! Nightmares plaguing my dreams were the thing stopping my sleep… making me fear sleep… visions of that night… reoccurring time and time again… the rogues invading our pack lands… us losing control… and them hurting my precious Isla. My beautiful Isla.

Fate had barely brought us together before snatching us apart… life could be cruel… and it made me relive that night, time and time again through my dreams… the pain as her life ebbed away… the inability to be able to save her… the pain in her eyes… the fear… it made me hate life… hate fate. And now, now it makes me fear sleep. Which is what found me pacing these godforsaken corridors every night…

“Alright Beta!” Marc, one of our young warriors, greeted me enthusiastically, telling me he had likely been out spending time with friends. Especially returning to his room at this early hour of the morning.

“Hey Marc.” I smiled, raising my eyebrows questioningly at him as he stumbled toward the stairs. He was barely able to walk in a straight line.

“I not been dinking, honest boss.” He mutters with a chuckle. These guys make me smile. How could they not? Barely past shifting age, and newly trained warriors. They clearly decided to drink themselves to the point of stupor. Which, considering we are werewolves and alcohol has little to no effect on us in small doses, they had to have been drinking excessive amounts! Likely coming up with new and different drinking challenges to see who could drink the most, that was what they so often did.

But, I can’t say I had not done the same when I first shifted and on many a younger night with friends. It was all part of growing up for many, wasn’t it? Especially for our warriors, I knew that, having helped many a drunken warrior home in the past. And I am sure they had had a good night and many good memories to look back on… if they could actually remember any of them, of course!

“I never said a word Marc.” I gave him a nod as he fell up the stairs.

I continued my pacing of the corridor only to hear a few more drunken voices approaching, I assume likely Marc’s drunk friends. And, I, not in the right frame of mind to have to deal with anyone else tonight, ducked into the short corridor off the main hallway of the packhouse. Leading to my office. I could sit in here until they passed and then make my way back to my room, and hopefully, I could attempt to gain at least a few hours’ sleep tonight, so I would be at least partially functionable tomorrow…

“What are you doing down here?!” a voice made me jump awake from my sleep, making me stir, and realize just how uncomfortable I was. My whole body ached. The crick in my neck felt like it had been locked in a vice... Though, as I moved, it was only then I realized I had fallen asleep sitting at my office desk. I had been asleep collapsed over my office desk since the early hours of the morning when I came in here to hide from the drunken warriors…

I sleepily raised my eyes upward, only to see my best friend, and the pack Alpha, standing next to my desk looking more than a little concerned, looking down over me. “Asher?” he questioned. “Why are you sleeping down here? This has to be the third or fourth time in a matter of weeks. And don't get me started on all the time prior to that.”

I sighed. Just what I need, him on my case. The third degree once again. Am I ok? Do I need some help? Support? That is likely what Caleb was about to start with… like always. He couldn’t help it. Though, I didn’t want to sound ungrateful. He was my closest friend after all, and he did just care. But, sometimes, some people just needed their space! It wasn’t like he could help… he couldn’t stop my suffering… this has been going on too long now…

“Was struggling to sleep, so I came down to work. I am guessing I must have crashed.” I told him. Not quite the truth, but it would do…

Caleb didn’t need to know that my sleep was so badly disturbed that I struggled to sleep every night. That my nights were so messed up I hadn’t slept properly since Isla had left…

“Is everything okay, Asher?” Caleb asked, and I could hear the concern dripping from his voice, like it so often does of late. “Eden said she has been worrying about you… that you just haven’t seemed yourself since the rogue attacks began. She said you seem so distant. So withdrawn.”

I shook my head with a disgusted roll of my eyes. So, they had been discussing me? Do they think that is acceptable? Yes, Eden may be his mate, and the Luna of the pack, as well as my friend, but I do not need to be some sort of sympathy case that needs to be sat and discussed between them over their evening meal! I am fine! I am the pack Beta for fuck’s sake. I focused my eyes upon my friend, a dark glare hopefully saying all I needed to.

“Caleb, you may be a friend, but please, for the love of god, fuck off. I am fine. Tired, yes. Stressed, yes. We have been dealing with rogue attacks regularly until lately. We need to work on improving the pack, which is what we are working on doing. It doesn’t come easily. It takes time. It takes energy and effort. So yeah, I am stressed and tired. Is that not my fucking job?” I snap, knowing I am already overstepping the mark talking to my Alpha in that way. He knew I had lost my mate because of these rogue attacks too, so you would think he would have shown at least a little understanding… but I wanted to continue going… needed to keep functioning or else I had nothing…

Caleb looks to me with a shake of his head. “Fine. Go get showered. You look like a fucking state. We have a meeting in half an hour.”

# Chapter 6 Asher

A shower later and a couple of coffees down, and I felt slightly more human, or as human as a werewolf can feel on next to no sleep…

I'm making a coffee table, and I'm making angles legs. The top right part will be screwed into the table top, and the angles section extending to the right will be the leg.

The question is: is this the best way to make this cut, it should I rotate it to align with the wood in some other way?

At first I wasn’t interested in him but with time i started liking him. Our mutuals told me that he’s interested cause we’ve been talking for 2 months now and he usually doesn’t talk to girls. He replies within a day and sometimes after few days. He told me hes been burnt out lately so hes not much in talking but randomly we had a talk on the call for 6 hours and then chatted till morning 10am.

(Idk i had a long crush on this guy but one incident made me hate him cause once i asked him if I could take a picture of him for some project, we hit it off nicely and the next day i tried greeting him and he ignored me, so i hated him) when i entered university and now i finally get to talk to him and mostly him replying to my stories. I feel uneasy, unsure about his feelings obviously i cant ask since i feel like he called me talked about his friends and shared his stories that he considers me as a good friend but he’s invested too much. Because he started approaching me, talking to me every time he saw me in university altho i was clearly uninterested).

lol. Moving forward to next few days, I dropped him a message to contact me asap cause i wanted some info, He called. It turned into a 2 hour call. I was bout to drop the call but he kept the convo going. Sounded more comfortable, shared his first love story and talked about his family. He then asked me if i wanna go watch a movie with him.

We went to watch the movie but sadly the cinema was full and no seats were available so we decided to go and grab coffee cause he was craving for it. He offered me a bike ride but i wasn’t comfortable so we booked an uber and grabbed coffees. He asked me if he could smoke and i was ok with it, we drank coffee, (i even tried his with his own straw which i don’t usually do and i told him that). I even told him that i usually dont wear lipgloss but I wore it today and he said he knows???? Why does he know that. later we walked and just talked about families our lore random here and there talks.

More to that when i got home, he called me and asked if i got home and he asked to bare him until he gets himself some ice cream.

Me and my partner have a coffee shop business po. The problem is, the landlord didn’t disclose that there are leaks in almost every corner of the place, coming from upstairs. Walang waterproofing. She promised us na ipapaayos niya ito before the rainy season, so we agreed. Ang sabi lang niya noon, sa CR lang may leak.

But now, our lights aren’t working anymore because of the leaks. Sumabog na rin yung ilaw sa CR. May mga leaks sa circuit. We haven’t been able to operate for several weeks dahil sobrang delikado, kahit anong punas namin, madulas pa rin ang tiles. When we came back, sobrang dami ring molds.

We signed a contract, pero hindi niya kami binigyan ng copy. We’ve been trying to reach out to her through text pero hindi siya nagre-reply. Pinuntahan na rin namin siya sa bahay pero palagi siyang wala. Her approach before was kinda rude rin.

We’re planning to request for the return of the 2-month advance (₱16,000) since naapektuhan talaga ang operations namin and there were a lot of damages. Ang dami naming pinaayos sa shop, only to find out ganito pala kalala yung situation. We’re not expecting na ibabalik niya since advance payment na nga yun, but the place is no longer habitable and safe to stay in.

May laban po ba kami if we bring this to the barangay? Hoping to seek advice po. :(

At first I wasn’t interested in him but with time i started liking him. Our mutuals told me that he’s interested cause we’ve been talking for 2 months now and he usually doesn’t talk to girls. He replies within a day and sometimes after few days. He told me hes been burnt out lately so hes not much in talking but randomly we had a talk on the call for 6 hours and then chatted till morning 10am.

(Idk i had a long crush on this guy but one incident made me hate him cause once i asked him if I could take a picture of him for some project, we hit it off nicely and the next day i tried greeting him and he ignored me, so i hated him) when i entered university and now i finally get to talk to him and mostly him replying to my stories. I feel uneasy, unsure about his feelings obviously i cant ask since i feel like he called me talked about his friends and shared his stories that he considers me as a good friend but he’s invested too much. Because he started approaching me, talking to me every time he saw me in university altho i was clearly uninterested).

lol. Moving forward to next few days, I dropped him a message to contact me asap cause i wanted some info, He called. It turned into a 2 hour call. I was bout to drop the call but he kept the convo going. Sounded more comfortable, shared his first love story and talked about his family. He then asked me if i wanna go watch a movie with him.

We went to watch the movie but sadly the cinema was full and no seats were available so we decided to go and grab coffee cause he was craving for it. He offered me a bike ride but i wasn’t comfortable so we booked an uber and grabbed coffees. He asked me if he could smoke and i was ok with it, we drank coffee, (i even tried his with his own straw which i don’t usually do and i told him that). I even told him that i usually dont wear lipgloss but I wore it today and he said he knows???? Why does he know that. later we walked and just talked about families our lore random here and there talks.

More to that when i got home, he called me and asked if i got home and he asked to bare him until he gets himself some ice cream. He kept yapping about the place he usually hangs out with his friends. He said that he kept his phone inside his helmet and he’s talking to me.

She was wrong. Now, she’s been handed over as a breeder to the strongest Alpha in the North, Alpha Lucien, who is as grumpy as he is handsome.



Lucien didn’t want a bride, especially not a weak omega forced on him by a desperate alliance. But here she is: Auren, innocent, and annoyingly hopeful. He’s furious, she’s confused, and neither of them knows how to handle this mess of a marriage.



Lucien makes it clear—this is a deal, not a love story. No emotions, no strings, and definitely no wandering into the north wing of the pack house. She’ll bear his heir, stay out of his way, and keep her nose out of his business.



So what happens when Lucien’s sharp words and colder-than-ice attitude keeps clashing with her innocent questions and big, dove-like eyes?



Can this unlikely pair turn their cold arrangement into something more, or will the curse claim another victim?



# Chapter 1



The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Thorne.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I’d felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.

Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‘No, he is our mate.’ She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.

For years, I’d dreamed of this moment—the day I’d find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn’t even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.

I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?

I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn’t stop bleeding. I didn’t know what to do or who to go to for comfort.

Alpha Bram’s cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn’t even want to acknowledge me.

Suddenly, the door opened.

# Chapter 2

Auren POV

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram’s father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack’s servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.

I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.

“Well, well,” she said, stepping closer. “If it isn’t our little orphan, sniveling like a child.”

I didn’t respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.

“I know what happened,” she said, her voice dripping with venom. “You think you’re special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.” She crouched down, her face close to mine. “We knew it long back. But you’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing. Bram doesn’t want you. He’ll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this pack.”

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.

“If you tell anyone—anyone—about this,” she continued, her voice low and dangerous, “I’ll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?”

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.

“Good. Now clean yourself up. You’re pathetic. I don’t want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you’ll regret it if they come to know the reason.” Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn’t end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. “You are reassigned to work in the toilets!” she barked at me. “Stay there until you get a new duty. Don’t you come out of that place!”

I balked as I stared at her. “What?” Toilets were the worst place to work.

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. “Did you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!”

Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris’s order.

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn’t done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone’s scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.

Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. “Reya, don’t let her get away with that,” she said, her tone filled with anger. “She’s nothing but trouble.”

It didn’t take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.

“You’ve caused enough problems,” Reya sneered immediately. “It’s time you learn a lesson.” And then came the blows. “No,” I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.

“What’s going on?” A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?

“Alpha Bram,” Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. “Auren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.” She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.

“No, it’s not–”

“How dare you?” Alpha Bram cut me off and roared in anger. “Throw her in the dungeons!” he ordered.

I was stunned. It was me, his mate, who was bleeding, and he didn’t even have a heart to respond to that. How naive of me to think of his coming to save me. This was just a perfect plan for them to get rid of me. And just like that, Maris and Reya dragged me to the dungeons—a dark, damp hole beneath the pack house where air was thick and musty, and the only light was coming from a single flickering torch.

“You’ll stay here until we decide you’ve learned your place,” Maris said, her voice laced with poison. She gave me one last triumphant smile before slamming the door shut. “Fucking bitch.”

Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine.

But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.

“Get up,” she said sharply. “Alpha Bram has called for you.”

I staggered to my feet, weak and disoriented. Surprise flickered through me. Did he finally want me? But her next words were like some had splashed icy cold water on me.

“He’s going to offer you to Alpha Lucien. You know what that means, don’t you? His bride will never last. You’ll be dead within a year.” She gave me a sly smile.

My heart dropped to my stomach. “What?” I said in a weak voice. “He can't do that. I— I—” It was worse than being in the dungeons. Everyone knew about Alpha Lucien. He was cursed, just like every Alpha in his family, and so ruthless that he killed first and talked later.

“Shut up!” Reya shouted. When I scrambled back, she came over, pulled me roughly and dragged me out of the dungeon. “You dimwit,” she retorted. “Did you really think you could ever compete with Lady Maris? Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You’ll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it’s a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully.”

# Chapter 3

Auren POV

As Reya dragged me out of the dungeons, my heart drummed against my ribcage out of pure fear. I couldn’t even think of marrying Alpha Lucien, not just because he was cursed, but also because Alpha Bram was my mate. The idea was abhorrent. It was better to die than to marry Alpha Lucien.

Summoning up whatever little energy I had left in me, I pulled my hand out of Reya’s and thought of running towards the forest that surrounded our pack. Once I got away from here, I was sure I would find help.

But the truth was cruel. I stood up, and the next second, my legs felt weak and my body collapsed. With a loud “bump”, I fell to the ground, so did my hope. The dust stung my lungs, my tears welling up in an instant. “No–” I struggled.

“Ha, you think you can escape?” Reya caught my neck with great force, turning my face to her. I couldn’t see her face clearly, but I assumed an evil smile there. “Get her.” She ordered before throwing me to the ground.

Two warriors jumped right in front of me. My eyes widened in horror. “Please leave me alone!” I begged them. “Let me live.”

As if my words irritated her, Reya came into my line of vision again. She directly charged at me and tackled me to the ground. She punched my side and I heard a crack. It meant that one of my ribs had fractured. A scream ripped out of my throat as my body turned numb in pain. “Live? You are so pathetic. Pick her up!” she ordered the warriors. One of them hauled me over his shoulder with no mercy to my fractured rib. As I screamed and cried and begged them to leave me, they carried me all the way to a little room in the omegas’ quarters and slammed the door shut behind them.

I pounded on the door, shouting, coughing blood. “Please leave me. Please.” But no one listened. Eventually, I slipped down on the floor with blood-stained clothes.

I don’t know how many hours went by when I heard the door creak open. I lifted my head only to see the pack's healer. “Luna Maris has sent me to you. Drink this draft,” he ordered. “It will reduce your pain.”

“C—can I talk to her?” I asked.

He clenched his jaw and without replying to me, forced me to have the draft and left, locking the door behind him.

I felt so weak and helpless that I sat against the wall as fresh tears sprang from my eyes. “This is not justified, goddess,” I said aloud. “It is not my fault that you bestowed Alpha Bram as my mate.” Alpha Lucien was the most ruthless Alpha in the north. “What have you written for me in this life?”

The door opened again and this time Alpha Bram walked in. He narrowed his eyes at me and scrunched his face. Shaking his head, he said, “How could the moon goddess bestow you as my mate? There must have been some mistake. You are so pathetic!”

With my eyes wide open, I stared at him with rage simmering in my chest. Feeling horrible under his gaze, I retorted, “I am not pathetic. You are pathetic! You are rejecting your moon-mate.”

He let out a growl and in a flash of a second, he grabbed my throat with his large hands. “Auren!” he shouted. “How dare you say that to your Alpha? You had the guts to run away and defy my orders.”

I started sputtering and coughing as he squeezed my airway.

“Bram!” Maris entered the room and shouted at him. “Don’t do that. Tomorrow she is going forever!”

Alpha Bram shoved me away and got up, still growling. And then came out the poisoned words,

“I, Alpha Bram Reed of the Crimson Howl Pack, reject you, Auren Cressida as my mate.”

“Noooo!” I shrieked as sharp pain stabbed my stomach and heart. My vision blurred and I doubled over, unable to move. Through my blurry vision, I saw Alpha Bram and Maris glaring at me coldly. Maris smirked and holding his hand, she walked out of the room, locking the door behind me.

“I will send Reya to dress her up tomorrow,” I heard her voice before I fainted.

When I woke up next, I felt numbness in my body. Seina had howled and whimpered all night and eventually rolled up in a ball and tucked away somewhere, where I couldn’t reach her. She was more hurt than I was.

Morning light was filtering in my room. It was a morning of doom. I didn’t have the strength to get up and do anything. I had lost my appetite. When the door opened again, I saw Reya entering with a box in her hand, followed by a maid.

She chuckled. “What a wretched bitch!” She pulled me up roughly. “Luna Maris has sent me to dress you up. But first you need a bath. You stink like a rotten critter.”

She dragged me to the bathroom where she opened a cold water shower. I shivered under it uncontrollably, but she was least bothered. When I came out, she threw a dress at me. “Wear this. Alpha Lucien will be here in an hour.”

I gaped at her with horror. Alpha Lucien was coming so fast?

The dress loosely hung over my shoulders. From the smell of it, I knew it was Maris’s old one.

Reya’s face lit up with a shrewd grin. “Congratulations, Auren. You are getting married to the most unwanted Alpha in the north. Consider yourself lucky that you will live another year while serving as his breeder.”

Chills ran down my body at the way she said it to me, and my knees felt wobbly. I walked shakily behind her until I reached the main hall.

The place was buzzing with activity. All the omegas were preparing for Alpha Lucien’s arrival. Maris was giving orders to them and as soon as she saw me, she sniggered. She jerked her chin to Reya who nodded and took me to a corner of the room. My eyes went to Alpha Bram who was talking to some people. Why was it that the rejection affected me and not him? Did his wolf not feel the pain? Tears came into my eyes again, but this time I refused to let them out because I didn’t want to give them the satisfaction of seeing me broken and shattered.

A few minutes later, he went out and when he returned, he was with Alpha Lucien. The most terrifyingly beautiful wolf I’d ever seen.

Towering at over six feet, his broad shoulders and chiseled physique radiated raw power. Midnight-black hair framed a cold, sharp, angular face, with dark eyes that seemed to pierce your soul. There were tattoos of vines and thorns on his muscular arms. His presence was magnetic yet menacing, like that of a silent, dangerous predator cloaked in charm.

When our gazes locked, I gasped and my cheeks heated.

# Chapter 4

Lucien POV

The council chamber of the Shadowfang Pack was stifling, filled with the heavy presence of my pack’s Elders. They had serious expression, their faces weathered with age and experience and their eyes carrying the weight of centuries of tradition. I stood before them, my arms crossed, my jaw tight as they droned on about duty and heirs.

“You cannot keep delaying this, Lucien,” Elder Orlan said in a sharp voice. “The pack needs an heir. Without one, we risk losing everything we’ve built.”

I clenched my fists, the sharp points of my claws pressing into my palms. “And what happens to the woman you force me to marry?” My voice was cold, laced with a simmering anger I couldn’t contain. “She will die, just like the others who died marrying my ancestors.” I really wanted to put an end to this.

Elder Ryna, the oldest among them, leaned forward, her pale gray eyes penetrating. “We know the cost of the curse. But the survival of the Shadowfang pack must come first. Your power keeps us strong, but strength alone will not secure our future.”

Their words were like iron chains around me, dragging me back to the nightmare I lived every day. The curse—a cruel legacy of my bloodline—had claimed every bride my forefathers had taken. On the night of the full moon after our bond was sealed, death would come for them, slowly, silent and final. Within a year they all died. How many women will die just to carry my bloodline?

It was said that centuries ago, the moon goddess cursed our Alpha bloodline for betraying love or breaking a sacred bond. Rejections happened all the time, but I don’t know why did the goddess curse my forefather? What was special about that mate bond?

I turned away, pacing to the window. The moon hung low in the sky, veiled by storm clouds. “You think an heir will fix this?” I said bitterly. “The curse will take them too. It doesn’t just stop with my bride.”

Orlan sighed heavily. “We don’t know that. There is a chance...”

“There is no chance!” I snapped, spinning to face them. “This curse is absolute. It doesn’t matter how strong I am or how much the Alphas of the North grovel for my alliance. They want my strength, not my curse.”

Ryna’s gaze didn’t waver. “Strength is what keeps us alive, Lucien. That’s why they seek you, despite the curse. It’s why we must ensure your bloodline continues. Without you, the North falls.”

Their words were upsetting, not because I disagreed, but because I knew they were right. The Shadowfang pack thrived because of me—because of the power I wielded. Alphas from all corners sought my favor. Their alliances were a testament to my strength. Yet beneath it all, I was hollow, bound by a curse that tainted everything it touched.

Elder Orlan said, “There is an offer from Alpha Bram. An alliance in exchange for one of his omegas as your bride. She’s expendable to him, but this alliance will secure his loyalty. It is a solution that benefits us all. He has been seeking your alliance from a long time.”

An omega. My stomach churned at the thought. I had no use for alliances built on the backs of weak and innocent. As such I disliked Bram. He was a slimy bastard.

I closed my eyes, the weight of their stares pressing on me. “If I agree, this alliance must serve the pack above all else.”

“Of course,” Ryna said, leaning back in her chair with satisfaction.

The decision settled like a stone in my chest. I would take another bride, knowing her fate, because I had no other choice. I was twenty-seven already and hadn't found my mate. And I knew that I couldn’t love my forced bride. Ever.

\---

The journey to Crimson Howl was uneventful, but my thoughts roiled with every mile. When we arrived, I noticed the pack house was bustling. Bram greeted me with a wide smile. “It’s a pleasure to have you here, Alpha Lucien.” I grunted in response.

He guided me to the main hall of his packhouse. “The omega I promised,” he said, gesturing toward the far corner. “Auren.”

My gaze followed his hand, landing on her. My breath hitched. Auren had golden hair that caught the light. She was small, barely reaching my shoulder, and she was trembling like a deer in headlight. Her face was soft like that of an elf, her presence fragile. She looked pale and thin as if she hadn’t had food for days. Her head was slightly bowed, but not out of submission—it felt like she was trying to disappear.

As she stepped forward, her scent hit me—a sweet, warm fragrance of apples that stirred my wolf. For a moment, she lifted her eyes to mine. They were gray, like that of a pale moon veiled in mist.

“Alpha Lucien,” Alpha Bram said, snapping me out of my thoughts. “I hope she will serve the purpose,” he added like she was a commodity. He stood beside me exuding false camaraderie. His grin was tight and it wasn't difficult to see through him. This was not a gesture of goodwill—it was a business transaction, plain and simple. I didn’t like the way his gaze lingered on her.

As for Auren, I didn’t care for her fragility or her fear. What roiled my insides was the blatant manipulation behind this so-called alliance. I had no intention of entertaining this charade. Yet I had no choice.

“Prepare the treaty,” I said flatly, not sparing her another glance.

Bram's face flickered with excitement. “Of course, Alpha Lucien. I’ll have it drawn up immediately.”

I turned to leave, but a commotion stopped me in my tracks.

“Worthless girl!” Maris’s voice rang out, dripping with venom. I knew who Maris was. Bram’s future Luna. A gold digger. Her father had approached me to marry her, but I had refused not because I had come to know of her plans of divorcing me and taking away half my money in less than a month, but because she was a repulsive creature. And now she found Bram. They fitted well.

I pivoted, my sharp gaze locking onto the scene. Auren was being yanked by her arm by Maris’s rough grip. The poor girl winced, her free hand attempting to shield herself.

Maris’s lips twisted into a sneer. “You should be grateful for this opportunity. You don’t deserve to breathe the same air as us, let alone be offered as a bride to Alpha Lucien. And now you’re making us look bad?”

“That’s enough.” My voice cut through the air like a blade.

Maris froze, her grip slackening on Auren’s arm. She turned to face me, her expression quickly shifting to one of false innocence. “Alpha Lucien, I was just—”

“I don’t care for your justifications,” I said coldly. “Behave yourself.”

Maris’s face reddened, but she protested, “She’s just an omega. She should know her place that she is nothing but a breeder.”

I took a step forward, my presence towering over hers. “Her place is no concern of yours. Do not test me.”

Surprised, Maris swallowed hard as she left her. “I—I’m sorry,” she muttered.

1maifyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1maifyt/fated_to_not_just_one_but_three/,"Fated To Not Just One, But Three","""Wake up, Olivia,"" Mom's voice echoed in my sleep.



I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. ""Five more minutes, Mom.""



""We don't have any more minutes,"" she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. ""Get up now, or we'll be late.""



""Mom,"" I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.



""Don't tell me you still want to sleep,"" she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. ""Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?"" Mother snapped angrily at me.



I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. ""I'm up, I'm up,"" I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.



""Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,"" Mother announced, and my frown deepened. ""Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?""



""Don't start,"" Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. ""Get moving. There's no time for complaining.""



I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.



The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.



Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We'd grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

That was before everything fell apart.



My father was one of the pack's strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.



But everything changed the night of the setup.



I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.



Anita was there that night. She hadn't comforted me, hadn't spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.



Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta's daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.



What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha's sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.



I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid's uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.



""Olivia,"" my mother called, ""I know this isn't easy, but… we've already lost so much. Don't give them a reason to take more.""



I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn't understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.



""Here,"" my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. ""She asked for this.""

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.



""I'll find my mate, and all this will be over,"" I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn't ending.



Reaching Anita's room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I'd fallen, and how far she'd risen.

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.



""Come in,"" Anita's voice called.



I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. ""Your coffee,"" I said quietly, stepping inside the room.



The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man's voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.



There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.



I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.



""Wait,"" Anita said sharply.



I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.



She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.



My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.



She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.



She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. ""What is this?"" she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.



""It's the coffee you requested,"" I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.



""This?"" she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. ""You call this coffee?""



My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""It was made in the way you like it,"" I said.



Anita's eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.



""Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I'll dump it on your face.""



Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.



I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?



""I'm sorry if the coffee wasn't to your liking,"" I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. ""I'll remake it.""



Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. ""Don't bother,"" she said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Just try to be less useless next time.""



Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn't even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.



""You're dismissed,"" he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.



I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.



As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.



Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox's personal guard. ""There you are. Lennox calls for you,""



I frowned. ""Did he say why?"" I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.



Bala shrugged. ""Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.""



A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox's room.



When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.



...

Olivia's POV



Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.



The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.



But that was before.



Before everything fell apart.



Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.



""Who cleaned my room yesterday?"" Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.



I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. ""I did.""



Lennox's expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.



""Then tell me, Omega,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, ""where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?""



I froze, my heart racing as Lennox's words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.



""I… I didn't see any necklace,"" I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.



Lennox's eyes narrowed. ""Don't lie to me, Omega,"" he growled, his tone laced with anger. ""The necklace didn't just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.""



""I'm not lying!"" I protested, panic creeping into my voice. ""I cleaned the room, but I didn't take anything. I swear!""



He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. ""You expect me to believe that?"" he snapped. ""You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.""



His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.



""I didn't take it,"" I repeated, my voice steadier this time. ""You can search me if you don't believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.""



Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.



I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers' pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.



Minutes later Lennox stopped searching, his breathing heavy as he stood amidst the chaos he had created. The necklace was nowhere to be found. He turned to me, his eyes blazing with frustration.



""I can't find it, Olivia. It's gone. That was a gift I got for Anita, a gift I wanted to give her on her eighteenth birthday. Do you know how much that cost me?"" he asked in anger.



I swallowed hard in fear but stood my ground. ""I did not take it…""



""Lies!"" he angrily cut me off.





Lennox exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. ""This doesn't make sense,"" he muttered. ""You cleaned my room. You were the last one here."" His gaze hardened. ""Don't lie to me, Olivia. Where is it?""



When I remained silent, his eyes blazed.



""You are a thief, just like your father! A thief!"" he cursed, and I pressed my lips together, holding myself back from answering him.



Lennox's words hit me like a blow to the chest. A thief. Just like my father. It didn't matter how hard I worked, how much I tried to keep my head down and stay out of trouble, this pack would always see me as the daughter of a disgraced warrior.



""Only two people came into this room yesterday,"" Lennox continued, his voice low and sharp, like the growl of his wolf ready to pounce. ""You and Anita. So, tell me, Olivia, who else could have taken it?""



I stiffened at his words, the pieces clicking together in my mind. Anita. Of course. She had been in his room yesterday. I remembered seeing her standing by his dresser, pretending to admire a framed photograph.



I knew Anita better than anyone else. She was cunning, always looking for ways to get what she wanted. I remembered the time she stole a pack warrior's silver bracelet, only to cry her way out of trouble. Or the time she framed a servant for breaking the Alpha's Favorite vase, earning the poor girl a week in the dungeons.

And now, she had done it again. But this time, I was her scapegoat.



Who would dare enter Lennox's room and steal something so valuable?



No one.



No one except Anita.



But the words were heavy on my tongue. I couldn't say it. Not to Lennox. If I accused Anita, I'd only make things worse for myself. No one would believe me. Lennox would defend her, just like everyone else did.



""I didn't take it,"" I said again.



Lennox let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. ""You think I'm stupid, don't you?""



I bit back a retort, my wolf growling in frustration. I wanted to scream the truth at him, to tell him that Anita was far from the innocent, perfect girl he thought she was. But I couldn't. Not without proof. And even if I had proof, it wouldn't matter. Anita had the triplets wrapped around her finger.



""You know what, Olivia?"" Lennox sneered, taking another step toward me. ""I'm done wasting my time with you. If that necklace doesn't turn up by the end of the day, I'll make sure you and your mother are punished. Severely.""



His words sent a chill down my spine, but I stood my ground, meeting his gaze. ""I didn't take it,"" I repeated one last time, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me.



Lennox glared at me for a moment longer before turning away, his shoulders tense with rage. ""I give you until the end of today to return that necklace. Get out,"" he growled.



I didn't need to be told twice. I turned and left the room, my heart pounding as I walked down the hallway. Once I was far enough away, I leaned against the wall, my legs trembling beneath me.



Anita. She had to be the one who took the necklace. I knew it in my gut. But how could I prove it without putting myself in even more danger? The triplets wouldn't believe me, and Anita would just deny it, twisting the situation to make me look like the villain.



""Here you are, Olivia,"" a guard said as he walked over to me. ""Levi is looking for you, and he doesn't seem happy.""



The guard's announcement made my heart sink in fear.



""Why? What happened?"" I asked, terrified.



Joshua, the guard, shook his head. ""I don't know, Olivia, but he is really furious and demanding for you.""



Shit! What could it be this time?



...

Olivia's POV



""Start talking, Olivia… before I lose my patience,"" Levi demanded, his voice laced with anger.



I stood frozen, unable to form words as I struggled to process the accusation. Again. I was being accused of stealing—again.



""Olivia!"" His voice thundered through the room. ""Don't make me lose my patience! Where is the bundle of dollar notes I kept in my drawer? Speak, you thief!""



My eyes widened in shock. But Before I could respond, the door to Levi's room burst open, and Louis stormed in, seething with rage.



""Olivia, where is the money I kept in my drawer?"" Louis demanded.



I took a step back, my breath hitching as both Levi and Louis glared at me with fiery rage. My heart pounded in my chest—not out of guilt, but out of sheer disbelief. This wasn't happening. Not again.



""I didn't take anything,"" I managed to say, my voice trembling.



Levi scoffed, running a frustrated hand through his hair. ""Really? Then tell us who else could have taken it. Who else enters our room if not you?""



Louis folded his arms, his frown deepening. ""Don't play innocent, Olivia. Just return the money and save us all the drama.""



Tears gathered in my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. At least not now.



Swallowing the lump in my throat, I forced myself to speak. ""I didn't take your money,"" I repeated, louder this time, my voice shaking with suppressed emotion. ""I would never steal from any of you.""



""Liar!""



I flinched at the new voice and turned to see Lennox standing at the doorway. His eyes, filled with cold hatred, locked onto mine.



""The necklace I bought for Anita is missing too,"" he announced, turning to his brothers.



All three of them—Levi, Louis, and Lennox—looked at me as if I were the worst kind of filth.



Levi was the first to walk toward me, and out of panic, I tried to run away, but it was useless. I was surrounded by the triplets.



Levi pinned me against the wall, lifting my hands above my head while his burning glare was staring right into my eyes.



""This is your last chance to confess and return what you stole, or you'll be dealt with accordingly,"" he threatened.



A tear slid down my cheek as I met his angry gaze. I knew, regardless of what I said, they would never believe that I didn't steal from them. They would never believe that their precious Anita was the one stealing from them.



""One… two…"" Levi began counting, and all I could do was shed more tears.



I sobbed silently, knowing the punishment for stealing in this household was brutal. Some thieves were thrown into the dungeons, like my father. Others had their hands chopped off. Some faced even worse fates.



As Levi counted, my mind raced. Would I end up like my father, rotting in a dungeon? Or worse?



""Ten.""



He released my wrists and took a step back.



""She's just like her father—a stubborn thief,"" Lennox sneered. More tears slipped down my cheeks.



""Guards! Bring some maids!"" Louis ordered sharply.



As we waited for the arrival of the maids, my heart raced in my chest. What were these men going to do to me? Why were they sending for maids?



My gaze met Lennox's, and he glared at me with so much hate, which made me wonder—did he really hate me just because my father was accused of stealing? Was this all about it, or was there something else involved? How could a man who once cherished me now look at me with such disgust?



Three maids walked in and bowed their heads to the triplets.



Levi was the one to usher the punishment. ""Take her to the mansion rooftop. Strip her and apply pepper to her naked body. Make sure she kneels under the sun.""



A tear slid down my cheek, but I didn't say a word. Compared to what was done to anyone accused of stealing, this was a lesser punishment for me.



""Take her away,"" Lennox demanded coldly.



The maids took hold of my arms and led me out of the room. I didn't struggle. There was no point. As we walked through the mansion, I saw my mother. She was sobbing, her entire body trembling, but she didn't dare approach me. If she did, she'd share my punishment.



When we reached the rooftop, the maids let go of me.



""Please undress,"" one of them urged softly.



I hesitated, my entire body trembling, but there was no escape. Swallowing hard, I began removing my clothes, my tears falling freely.



One of the maids picked up a bowl of ground pepper and moved closer. My body tensed.



The moment the first handful of pepper touched my skin, an agonized scream tore from my lips. My body convulsed as the fiery sting spread across my skin. They rubbed it everywhere—every inch of my exposed flesh except for my face. The burning sensation was unbearable. My knees buckled, but I forced myself to stay upright.



""You have to kneel,"" one of the maids said.



I hesitated, but my body was already giving in. Slowly, I sank to my knees, my sobs wracking my entire being. The scorching sun hit down on me, intensifying the torment. My entire body felt like it was on fire.



How could anyone be so cruel?



I wanted to scream, to beg for the pain to stop, but I knew it would only make things worse.



It was as if the sun was against me because it began to heat even more. My whole body was burning with pain, and it felt like I would pass out soon. The pain was unbearable. I had never imagined I would go through such torture.



With tear-filled eyes, I looked at the maids who stood in a corner, staring at me with pity. Painful tears trickled down my cheeks while my entire body burned. As the excruciating pain enveloped me, my vision blurred, and my head spun.



Painful memories flashed through my mind. The triplets used to adore me. They used to fight over who got to spend more time with me. They used to playfully argue about which one of them would marry me when we grew up.



How did everything change so drastically?



How did men who once cherished me suddenly hate me so much?



I wished my father hadn't been framed. I wished he had been proven innocent. Then, maybe… maybe, the triplets wouldn't hate me this much.



The fiery sting of the pepper intensified, searing every inch of my exposed skin. I struggled to remain upright, my knees weakening beneath me. With each agonizing breath, the world seemed to tilt and sway until, finally, I could no longer fight the overwhelming sensation of nausea and torment.



My body gave way, and I crumpled to the ground. Distant voices called my name, but I was already slipping into darkness, into the past. Into the days when the triplets swore they'd protect me. Back when they fought over who would marry me, not who would break me. But those boys were gone. And so was I.



...

Lennox's POV



An uncomfortable silence hung in the air as neither my brothers nor I spoke. The tension was thick, almost suffocating. An uneasy feeling settled in my chest as my thoughts drifted to Olivia—to the pain she might be going through. A part of me wanted to stop the punishment, to let it go. But if I did, it would show weakness, a soft spot for her. And I didn't want that. I couldn't afford that. Not after what she did to me.



""I wonder what she plans to do with all the things she stole,"" Levi spat, his voice sharp with anger, breaking the silence.



I turned to look at him, noticing the anger in his eyes. He was just as pissed as I was.



""Maybe she has a boyfriend she plans to give them to,"" Louis grunted.



The mere thought of that sent a sharp, uncomfortable pain through my chest, but I shoved it down and stood abruptly. ""Tell the guards to search her things. Perhaps they're still in her room.""



Without waiting for a response, I left the room, heading back to mine.



The mess I had created in my earlier frustration still littered in my room—broken glass, overturned furniture, scattered papers. I ignored it and walked straight to the minibar, grabbing a bottle of whiskey. Uncorking it, I took a long swig, feeling the burn slide down my throat.



With a sigh, I sank onto the bed, but no matter how hard I tried, my thoughts kept drifting back to Olivia. The punishment she was enduring on the rooftop. I glanced at the window—the sun was scorching.



""If you're so worried about her, then stop the punishment."" My wolf's voice rumbled in my head.



I clenched my jaw. ""Why should I? Did she think about how I felt years ago when she hurt me? When she said those things?""



The door to my room pushed open, and Anita stepped inside. Her brows furrowed as she took in the mess in my room before her gaze landed on the whiskey bottle in my hand.



""Lennox, are you drinking because of the missing necklace?"" she asked, concern lacing her voice.



I swallowed hard. No. The necklace wasn't why I was drowning myself in whiskey. It was Olivia. But I couldn't say that to Anita.



""Yes. It was a gift for you,"" I murmured instead.



Anita sighed and walked closer, kneeling before me. Gently, she took the bottle from my hand and placed it aside before looking directly into my eyes.



""You don't have to do this to yourself over a necklace. You can always get me another one, right?"" she said, her voice soft, comforting.



And she was right. Money wasn't the issue. My brothers and I were the sons of the richest Alpha in the world and soon to be Alphas. A stolen diamond necklace shouldn't be enough to put me in this mood.



""Or…"" Anita tilted her head, her gaze searching mine. ""Is there something else bothering you?"" Anita asked, raising a suspicious brow.



I quickly shook my head.



She studied me for a moment before a slow smirk curled her lips. ""I know exactly what you need.""



Before I could ask what she meant, she reached for the hem of her dress and pulled it over her head, letting the fabric fall to the floor. My gaze traveled over her exposed skin, the smooth curves of her body.



""Come on,"" she whispered, her voice sultry. ""Let me help you take out your frustration.""



I said nothing as she unclasped her bra, letting it slide off her shoulders. Then, she moved closer, pressing her body against mine. Her hands traced down my chest, her fingers slowly unbuttoning my shirt before pushing it off.



""Use me, Lennox,"" she breathed, tilting her head up to meet my gaze. ""Pour all your anger into me. Take what you need.""



A dark hunger stirred inside me—the need to lose myself, to forget everything—even if just for a moment. I grabbed the back of her neck, pulling her into a bruising kiss. She gasped against my lips, but I didn't slow down. I pushed her back onto the bed, climbing over her, my body pressing her into the mattress. I ran hungry and angry kisses all over her body before pulling away and standing before her.



Anita lay back on the bed, her legs spread, her body on full display for me. Her smirk was teasing, her eyes dark with anticipation. She knew what I wanted—what I needed—and she was more than willing to give it to me.



I didn't waste time. My belt hit the floor with a sharp clink, and I shoved my pants down, my cock already hard and aching. I crawled onto the bed, grabbing Anita's ankles and yanking her closer, making her gasp in surprise.



""So rough, so dominant,"" she purred, but I wasn't in the mood for her teasing.



I wrapped my fingers around her throat, squeezing just enough to make her gasp. ""Shut up,"" I growled, watching her eyes widen with excitement.



Her lips parted, her breath hitching as I tightened my grip just a little more. ""Yes, Master,"" she whispered.



That sent a dark thrill through me. I released her throat and grabbed her hips, flipping her onto her stomach in one swift motion. She barely had time to brace herself before I yanked her up onto her knees, positioning her exactly how I wanted.



I ran a hand down her spine, feeling her shiver under my touch. ""You're wet already,"" I noted darkly, dragging my fingers through her slick folds.



She whimpered, pressing back against me, silently begging for more.



But I wasn't feeling generous tonight.



I grabbed a fistful of her hair, yanking her head back as I aligned myself with her entrance. ""Beg for it,"" I commanded.



She moaned, her fingers gripping the sheets. ""Please, Master,"" she gasped. ""I need you.""



That was all I needed.



With one hard thrust, I slammed into her, making her cry out. I didn't give her time to adjust—I didn't want to. I set a brutal pace from the start, pounding into her relentlessly. The bed frame creaked beneath us, the sound of skin slapping against skin filling the room.



Anita moaned loudly, her body rocking forward with every thrust, but I pulled her back against me, keeping her exactly where I wanted. My grip on her hips was bruising, my nails digging into her flesh as I took her hard and rough, just the way I needed.



""Who do you belong to?"" I growled, yanking her head back again.



""You, Lennox,"" she panted, her voice breaking with pleasure. ""Only you.""



I smirked darkly. ""Damn right.""



I released her hair and pressed her chest down onto the mattress, driving deeper into her. My control was slipping, my wolf growling as I fucked her like an animal.



She was screaming now, her body shuddering beneath me, but I didn't stop. I couldn't stop. Not until I had taken everything I wanted from her.



And I wasn't done yet.



Anita's body trembled beneath me, her moans filling the room as I drove into her relentlessly. But no matter how hard I took her, no matter how much she screamed my name, it wasn't enough.



Because it wasn't her.



I clenched my jaw, trying to push the thought away, but it was useless. My mind betrayed me, painting a different picture. It wasn't Anita's dark hair spilling over her shoulders—it was Olivia's. It wasn't Anita's moans filling my ears—it was Olivia's breathless whimpers, the way I knew she'd sound if I ever had her like this.



""Lennox…"" Anita gasped, her voice breaking with pleasure as she arched her back, pressing against me. But for a moment, I didn't hear Anita. I heard Olivia.



A violent need surged through me. I pulled out of her suddenly, making her whimper at the loss. Before she could protest, I flipped onto my back and grabbed her by the waist, pulling her over me.



""Ride me,"" I ordered, my voice rough with need.



Anita grinned, straddling me eagerly. She reached down, positioning herself before sinking onto my cock with a moan. Her head fell back, her nails digging into my chest as she took me deep.



I gritted my teeth, my hands gripping her hips tightly as she began to move. But I wasn't watching Anita anymore.



I was watching Olivia.



In my mind, it was her above me, her red lips parted in breathless pleasure. It was her soft skin beneath my hands, her tight pussy wrapped around me.



""Fuck,"" I growled, my grip tightening. I drove my hips up hard, making Anita cry out. But all I saw was Olivia.



How would she look like this? Would she be shy? Would she try to fight the pleasure, or would she surrender to it completely?



I imagined her whimpering my name, her nails dragging down my chest as she came apart for me.



A low, possessive growl rumbled from my chest. Olivia wasn't supposed to be in my head like this. She wasn't supposed to be the one I craved. I hated her. She had hurt me, but I couldn't stop thinking about her.



And no matter how hard I tried, no matter how many times I fucked Anita or anyone else, no one could take her place.



Anita's pace quickened, her nails scraping against my chest as she rode me harder, chasing her release. My grip on her hips was firm, guiding her movements, but my mind was elsewhere.



Not here. Not with her.



With Olivia.



I could almost see her—imagine the way her body would tremble above me, the way her lips would part in a gasp as she took me deep. My control slipped at the thought, my grip tightening as I thrust up into Anita with brutal force.



""Lennox—"" Anita gasped, her body tensing. She was close.



I was too.



With one last punishing thrust, I sent her over the edge. Her body clenched around me as she cried out, shuddering in pleasure. The sensation pushed me past my limit, and with a low growl, I let go.



Pleasure ripped through me, my release spilling into the condom as I buried myself deep inside her. My breathing was heavy, my chest rising and falling as I rode out the aftershocks.



For a brief moment, silence filled the room, broken only by Anita's soft panting.



Then, without a word, I reached down and pulled out of her. My body was still humming with satisfaction, but the moment was already fading.



Because it wasn't Olivia.



It never was.



Anita stretched beside me, her fingers lazily trailing down my chest. ""Damn, that was hot,"" she breathed.



I didn't respond. Instead, I reached over and pulled her into my arms. For a moment, we didn't say a word until the door opened and Levi and Louis walked in.



""So you two were having fun without us,"" Louis said, and Anita, loving the attention, giggled softly.



""Move away, Lennox,"" Levi grumbled.



I sighed and rolled out of bed as Levi and Louis positioned themselves beside Anita, wasting no time before devouring her like hungry animals.



I moved away from the bed, walking into the bathroom and turning on the shower. As I stood under the cold water, I could still hear the muffled moans coming from my room.



My brothers and I did practically everything together. We shared everything—so sharing Anita, or any other woman, was nothing new. But we also competed against each other.



Who was the best fighter.

The strongest wolf.

The fastest shifter.



Sometimes, it even came down to who fucked better. Who Anita enjoyed more.



And most importantly—who would end up being her mate.



We all knew that on her eighteenth birthday, she would be mated to one of us. And if fate was cruel enough, to all three of us.



And whoever she was mated to would be Dad's favorite. The pack's favored Alpha.



So, in a way, we were all competing for her.



But that didn't mean we didn't love each other.



Sighing heavily, I thought of Olivia, of the good memories I had of her. Of how I fell in love with her even as just a little boy of twelve. How I competed with my brothers, assuming they liked her too.



As we grew older, I thought she liked me too.



But I was wrong. So damn wrong.



Turning off the shower, I tied a towel around my waist and walked back into the room.



Back in my room, I found Levi and Louis fucking Anita dominantly. She was on her knees, Levi's cock in her mouth while Louis fucked her from behind.



Their moans filled the air, but I ignored them, walking over to grab a pair of simple track pants. I needed a run. I needed to clear my head.



I pulled them on and left the room without another word.



But just as I stepped into the hallway, a female servant rushed up to me, looking panicked.



""Young master, Olivia just fainted on the rooftop,"" she announced, her voice trembling.



My breath caught. Panic surged through me, but I forced myself to stay composed.



""Then wake her up and send her back in,"" I said, sounding nonchalant as I hid my worry.



""That's the problem,"" the servant insisted.

""We've tried waking her, but she's not responding.""



I furrowed my brow, my frown deepening. ""What do you mean?""



She swallowed hard, her eyes wide with fear. ""She's not breathing.""

1maie40,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1maie40/triplet_alphas_omega_mate/,Triplet Alpha's Omega Mate,"""Wake up, Olivia,"" Mom's voice echoed in my sleep.



I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. ""Five more minutes, Mom.""



""We don't have any more minutes,"" she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. ""Get up now, or we'll be late.""



""Mom,"" I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.



""Don't tell me you still want to sleep,"" she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. ""Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?"" Mother snapped angrily at me.



I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. ""I'm up, I'm up,"" I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.



""Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,"" Mother announced, and my frown deepened. ""Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?""



""Don't start,"" Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. ""Get moving. There's no time for complaining.""



I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.



The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.



Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We'd grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

That was before everything fell apart.



My father was one of the pack's strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.



But everything changed the night of the setup.



I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.



Anita was there that night. She hadn't comforted me, hadn't spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.



Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta's daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.



What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha's sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.



I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid's uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.



""Olivia,"" my mother called, ""I know this isn't easy, but… we've already lost so much. Don't give them a reason to take more.""



I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn't understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.



""Here,"" my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. ""She asked for this.""

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.



""I'll find my mate, and all this will be over,"" I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn't ending.



Reaching Anita's room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I'd fallen, and how far she'd risen.

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.



""Come in,"" Anita's voice called.



I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. ""Your coffee,"" I said quietly, stepping inside the room.



The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man's voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.



There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.



I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.



""Wait,"" Anita said sharply.



I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.



She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.



My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.



She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.



She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. ""What is this?"" she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.



""It's the coffee you requested,"" I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.



""This?"" she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. ""You call this coffee?""



My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""It was made in the way you like it,"" I said.



Anita's eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.



""Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I'll dump it on your face.""



Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.



I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?



""I'm sorry if the coffee wasn't to your liking,"" I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. ""I'll remake it.""



Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. ""Don't bother,"" she said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Just try to be less useless next time.""



Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn't even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.



""You're dismissed,"" he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.



I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.



As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.



Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox's personal guard. ""There you are. Lennox calls for you,""



I frowned. ""Did he say why?"" I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.



Bala shrugged. ""Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.""



A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox's room.



When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.



...

Olivia's POV



Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.



The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.



But that was before.



Before everything fell apart.



Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.



""Who cleaned my room yesterday?"" Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.



I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. ""I did.""



Lennox's expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.



""Then tell me, Omega,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, ""where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?""



I froze, my heart racing as Lennox's words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.



""I… I didn't see any necklace,"" I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.



Lennox's eyes narrowed. ""Don't lie to me, Omega,"" he growled, his tone laced with anger. ""The necklace didn't just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.""



""I'm not lying!"" I protested, panic creeping into my voice. ""I cleaned the room, but I didn't take anything. I swear!""



He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. ""You expect me to believe that?"" he snapped. ""You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.""



His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.



""I didn't take it,"" I repeated, my voice steadier this time. ""You can search me if you don't believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.""



Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.



I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers' pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.



Minutes later Lennox stopped searching, his breathing heavy as he stood amidst the chaos he had created. The necklace was nowhere to be found. He turned to me, his eyes blazing with frustration.



""I can't find it, Olivia. It's gone. That was a gift I got for Anita, a gift I wanted to give her on her eighteenth birthday. Do you know how much that cost me?"" he asked in anger.



I swallowed hard in fear but stood my ground. ""I did not take it…""



""Lies!"" he angrily cut me off.





Lennox exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. ""This doesn't make sense,"" he muttered. ""You cleaned my room. You were the last one here."" His gaze hardened. ""Don't lie to me, Olivia. Where is it?""



When I remained silent, his eyes blazed.



""You are a thief, just like your father! A thief!"" he cursed, and I pressed my lips together, holding myself back from answering him.



Lennox's words hit me like a blow to the chest. A thief. Just like my father. It didn't matter how hard I worked, how much I tried to keep my head down and stay out of trouble, this pack would always see me as the daughter of a disgraced warrior.



""Only two people came into this room yesterday,"" Lennox continued, his voice low and sharp, like the growl of his wolf ready to pounce. ""You and Anita. So, tell me, Olivia, who else could have taken it?""



I stiffened at his words, the pieces clicking together in my mind. Anita. Of course. She had been in his room yesterday. I remembered seeing her standing by his dresser, pretending to admire a framed photograph.



I knew Anita better than anyone else. She was cunning, always looking for ways to get what she wanted. I remembered the time she stole a pack warrior's silver bracelet, only to cry her way out of trouble. Or the time she framed a servant for breaking the Alpha's Favorite vase, earning the poor girl a week in the dungeons.

And now, she had done it again. But this time, I was her scapegoat.



Who would dare enter Lennox's room and steal something so valuable?



No one.



No one except Anita.



But the words were heavy on my tongue. I couldn't say it. Not to Lennox. If I accused Anita, I'd only make things worse for myself. No one would believe me. Lennox would defend her, just like everyone else did.



""I didn't take it,"" I said again.



Lennox let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. ""You think I'm stupid, don't you?""



I bit back a retort, my wolf growling in frustration. I wanted to scream the truth at him, to tell him that Anita was far from the innocent, perfect girl he thought she was. But I couldn't. Not without proof. And even if I had proof, it wouldn't matter. Anita had the triplets wrapped around her finger.



""You know what, Olivia?"" Lennox sneered, taking another step toward me. ""I'm done wasting my time with you. If that necklace doesn't turn up by the end of the day, I'll make sure you and your mother are punished. Severely.""



His words sent a chill down my spine, but I stood my ground, meeting his gaze. ""I didn't take it,"" I repeated one last time, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me.



Lennox glared at me for a moment longer before turning away, his shoulders tense with rage. ""I give you until the end of today to return that necklace. Get out,"" he growled.



I didn't need to be told twice. I turned and left the room, my heart pounding as I walked down the hallway. Once I was far enough away, I leaned against the wall, my legs trembling beneath me.



Anita. She had to be the one who took the necklace. I knew it in my gut. But how could I prove it without putting myself in even more danger? The triplets wouldn't believe me, and Anita would just deny it, twisting the situation to make me look like the villain.



""Here you are, Olivia,"" a guard said as he walked over to me. ""Levi is looking for you, and he doesn't seem happy.""



The guard's announcement made my heart sink in fear.



""Why? What happened?"" I asked, terrified.



Joshua, the guard, shook his head. ""I don't know, Olivia, but he is really furious and demanding for you.""



Shit! What could it be this time?



...

Olivia's POV



""Start talking, Olivia… before I lose my patience,"" Levi demanded, his voice laced with anger.



I stood frozen, unable to form words as I struggled to process the accusation. Again. I was being accused of stealing—again.



""Olivia!"" His voice thundered through the room. ""Don't make me lose my patience! Where is the bundle of dollar notes I kept in my drawer? Speak, you thief!""



My eyes widened in shock. But Before I could respond, the door to Levi's room burst open, and Louis stormed in, seething with rage.



""Olivia, where is the money I kept in my drawer?"" Louis demanded.



I took a step back, my breath hitching as both Levi and Louis glared at me with fiery rage. My heart pounded in my chest—not out of guilt, but out of sheer disbelief. This wasn't happening. Not again.



""I didn't take anything,"" I managed to say, my voice trembling.



Levi scoffed, running a frustrated hand through his hair. ""Really? Then tell us who else could have taken it. Who else enters our room if not you?""



Louis folded his arms, his frown deepening. ""Don't play innocent, Olivia. Just return the money and save us all the drama.""



Tears gathered in my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. At least not now.



Swallowing the lump in my throat, I forced myself to speak. ""I didn't take your money,"" I repeated, louder this time, my voice shaking with suppressed emotion. ""I would never steal from any of you.""



""Liar!""



I flinched at the new voice and turned to see Lennox standing at the doorway. His eyes, filled with cold hatred, locked onto mine.



""The necklace I bought for Anita is missing too,"" he announced, turning to his brothers.



All three of them—Levi, Louis, and Lennox—looked at me as if I were the worst kind of filth.



Levi was the first to walk toward me, and out of panic, I tried to run away, but it was useless. I was surrounded by the triplets.



Levi pinned me against the wall, lifting my hands above my head while his burning glare was staring right into my eyes.



""This is your last chance to confess and return what you stole, or you'll be dealt with accordingly,"" he threatened.



A tear slid down my cheek as I met his angry gaze. I knew, regardless of what I said, they would never believe that I didn't steal from them. They would never believe that their precious Anita was the one stealing from them.



""One… two…"" Levi began counting, and all I could do was shed more tears.



I sobbed silently, knowing the punishment for stealing in this household was brutal. Some thieves were thrown into the dungeons, like my father. Others had their hands chopped off. Some faced even worse fates.



As Levi counted, my mind raced. Would I end up like my father, rotting in a dungeon? Or worse?



""Ten.""



He released my wrists and took a step back.



""She's just like her father—a stubborn thief,"" Lennox sneered. More tears slipped down my cheeks.



""Guards! Bring some maids!"" Louis ordered sharply.



As we waited for the arrival of the maids, my heart raced in my chest. What were these men going to do to me? Why were they sending for maids?



My gaze met Lennox's, and he glared at me with so much hate, which made me wonder—did he really hate me just because my father was accused of stealing? Was this all about it, or was there something else involved? How could a man who once cherished me now look at me with such disgust?



Three maids walked in and bowed their heads to the triplets.



Levi was the one to usher the punishment. ""Take her to the mansion rooftop. Strip her and apply pepper to her naked body. Make sure she kneels under the sun.""



A tear slid down my cheek, but I didn't say a word. Compared to what was done to anyone accused of stealing, this was a lesser punishment for me.



""Take her away,"" Lennox demanded coldly.



The maids took hold of my arms and led me out of the room. I didn't struggle. There was no point. As we walked through the mansion, I saw my mother. She was sobbing, her entire body trembling, but she didn't dare approach me. If she did, she'd share my punishment.



When we reached the rooftop, the maids let go of me.



""Please undress,"" one of them urged softly.



I hesitated, my entire body trembling, but there was no escape. Swallowing hard, I began removing my clothes, my tears falling freely.



One of the maids picked up a bowl of ground pepper and moved closer. My body tensed.



The moment the first handful of pepper touched my skin, an agonized scream tore from my lips. My body convulsed as the fiery sting spread across my skin. They rubbed it everywhere—every inch of my exposed flesh except for my face. The burning sensation was unbearable. My knees buckled, but I forced myself to stay upright.



""You have to kneel,"" one of the maids said.



I hesitated, but my body was already giving in. Slowly, I sank to my knees, my sobs wracking my entire being. The scorching sun hit down on me, intensifying the torment. My entire body felt like it was on fire.



How could anyone be so cruel?



I wanted to scream, to beg for the pain to stop, but I knew it would only make things worse.



It was as if the sun was against me because it began to heat even more. My whole body was burning with pain, and it felt like I would pass out soon. The pain was unbearable. I had never imagined I would go through such torture.



With tear-filled eyes, I looked at the maids who stood in a corner, staring at me with pity. Painful tears trickled down my cheeks while my entire body burned. As the excruciating pain enveloped me, my vision blurred, and my head spun.



Painful memories flashed through my mind. The triplets used to adore me. They used to fight over who got to spend more time with me. They used to playfully argue about which one of them would marry me when we grew up.



How did everything change so drastically?



How did men who once cherished me suddenly hate me so much?



I wished my father hadn't been framed. I wished he had been proven innocent. Then, maybe… maybe, the triplets wouldn't hate me this much.



The fiery sting of the pepper intensified, searing every inch of my exposed skin. I struggled to remain upright, my knees weakening beneath me. With each agonizing breath, the world seemed to tilt and sway until, finally, I could no longer fight the overwhelming sensation of nausea and torment.



My body gave way, and I crumpled to the ground. Distant voices called my name, but I was already slipping into darkness, into the past. Into the days when the triplets swore they'd protect me. Back when they fought over who would marry me, not who would break me. But those boys were gone. And so was I.



...

Lennox's POV



An uncomfortable silence hung in the air as neither my brothers nor I spoke. The tension was thick, almost suffocating. An uneasy feeling settled in my chest as my thoughts drifted to Olivia—to the pain she might be going through. A part of me wanted to stop the punishment, to let it go. But if I did, it would show weakness, a soft spot for her. And I didn't want that. I couldn't afford that. Not after what she did to me.



""I wonder what she plans to do with all the things she stole,"" Levi spat, his voice sharp with anger, breaking the silence.



I turned to look at him, noticing the anger in his eyes. He was just as pissed as I was.



""Maybe she has a boyfriend she plans to give them to,"" Louis grunted.



The mere thought of that sent a sharp, uncomfortable pain through my chest, but I shoved it down and stood abruptly. ""Tell the guards to search her things. Perhaps they're still in her room.""



Without waiting for a response, I left the room, heading back to mine.



The mess I had created in my earlier frustration still littered in my room—broken glass, overturned furniture, scattered papers. I ignored it and walked straight to the minibar, grabbing a bottle of whiskey. Uncorking it, I took a long swig, feeling the burn slide down my throat.



With a sigh, I sank onto the bed, but no matter how hard I tried, my thoughts kept drifting back to Olivia. The punishment she was enduring on the rooftop. I glanced at the window—the sun was scorching.



""If you're so worried about her, then stop the punishment."" My wolf's voice rumbled in my head.



I clenched my jaw. ""Why should I? Did she think about how I felt years ago when she hurt me? When she said those things?""



The door to my room pushed open, and Anita stepped inside. Her brows furrowed as she took in the mess in my room before her gaze landed on the whiskey bottle in my hand.



""Lennox, are you drinking because of the missing necklace?"" she asked, concern lacing her voice.



I swallowed hard. No. The necklace wasn't why I was drowning myself in whiskey. It was Olivia. But I couldn't say that to Anita.



""Yes. It was a gift for you,"" I murmured instead.



Anita sighed and walked closer, kneeling before me. Gently, she took the bottle from my hand and placed it aside before looking directly into my eyes.



""You don't have to do this to yourself over a necklace. You can always get me another one, right?"" she said, her voice soft, comforting.



And she was right. Money wasn't the issue. My brothers and I were the sons of the richest Alpha in the world and soon to be Alphas. A stolen diamond necklace shouldn't be enough to put me in this mood.



""Or…"" Anita tilted her head, her gaze searching mine. ""Is there something else bothering you?"" Anita asked, raising a suspicious brow.



I quickly shook my head.



She studied me for a moment before a slow smirk curled her lips. ""I know exactly what you need.""



Before I could ask what she meant, she reached for the hem of her dress and pulled it over her head, letting the fabric fall to the floor. My gaze traveled over her exposed skin, the smooth curves of her body.



""Come on,"" she whispered, her voice sultry. ""Let me help you take out your frustration.""



I said nothing as she unclasped her bra, letting it slide off her shoulders. Then, she moved closer, pressing her body against mine. Her hands traced down my chest, her fingers slowly unbuttoning my shirt before pushing it off.



""Use me, Lennox,"" she breathed, tilting her head up to meet my gaze. ""Pour all your anger into me. Take what you need.""



A dark hunger stirred inside me—the need to lose myself, to forget everything—even if just for a moment. I grabbed the back of her neck, pulling her into a bruising kiss. She gasped against my lips, but I didn't slow down. I pushed her back onto the bed, climbing over her, my body pressing her into the mattress. I ran hungry and angry kisses all over her body before pulling away and standing before her.



Anita lay back on the bed, her legs spread, her body on full display for me. Her smirk was teasing, her eyes dark with anticipation. She knew what I wanted—what I needed—and she was more than willing to give it to me.



I didn't waste time. My belt hit the floor with a sharp clink, and I shoved my pants down, my cock already hard and aching. I crawled onto the bed, grabbing Anita's ankles and yanking her closer, making her gasp in surprise.



""So rough, so dominant,"" she purred, but I wasn't in the mood for her teasing.



I wrapped my fingers around her throat, squeezing just enough to make her gasp. ""Shut up,"" I growled, watching her eyes widen with excitement.



Her lips parted, her breath hitching as I tightened my grip just a little more. ""Yes, Master,"" she whispered.



That sent a dark thrill through me. I released her throat and grabbed her hips, flipping her onto her stomach in one swift motion. She barely had time to brace herself before I yanked her up onto her knees, positioning her exactly how I wanted.



I ran a hand down her spine, feeling her shiver under my touch. ""You're wet already,"" I noted darkly, dragging my fingers through her slick folds.



She whimpered, pressing back against me, silently begging for more.



But I wasn't feeling generous tonight.



I grabbed a fistful of her hair, yanking her head back as I aligned myself with her entrance. ""Beg for it,"" I commanded.

But just as I was about to tell him I was pr\*\*nant with our child, he dropped a bombshell.  
  
He needed me to take the fall for his childhood sweetheart, Everleigh. She'd been in a hit-and-run, and her career couldn't handle the scandal.  
  
When I refused and told him about our baby, his face went cold. He told me to terminate the pr\*\*nancy immediately.  
  
""Everleigh is the woman I love,"" he said. ""Finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her.""  
  
He had his assistant schedule the appointment and sent me to the clinic alone. There, the nurse told me the procedure carried a high risk of permanent infertility.  
  
He knew. And he still sent me.  
  
I walked out of that clinic, choosing to keep my child. At that exact moment, a news alert lit up my phone. It was a glowing article announcing that Ignatz and Everleigh were expecting their first child, complete with a photo of his hand resting protectively on her stomach.  
  
My world shattered. Wiping away a tear, I found the number I hadn't called in five years.  
  
""Dad,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I'm ready to come home.""  
  
  
Chapter 1  
""What did you just say?""  
  
The question hung in the air of our minimalist apartment, the one I had designed. My voice was barely a wh\*\*per.  
  
Ignatz Turner, my boyfriend of five years, didn't even look up from his phone. He just repeated it, calm and matter-of-fact.  
  
""I said Everleigh needs you to take the blame. It was a hit-and-run, Gen. A minor one, nobody was seriously hurt, but her career can't handle a scandal right now.""  
  
I stared at him, at the handsome face I had loved for so long. Now, it looked like a stranger's.  
  
""You want me to say I was driving her car? That I hit someone and fled the scene?""  
  
""It makes sense,"" he said, finally lifting his eyes. They were cool, rational. ""You're a private person, an architect. You don't have a public image to protect. You can handle the heat. Everleigh... she's fragile.""  
  
My hands started to shake. ""Fragile? Ignatz, she broke the law. What about my record? My career?""  
  
""It won't affect your career,"" he said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Our lawyers will handle it. A fine, maybe some community service. It's nothing.""  
  
I felt a cold anger rise in my ch\*\*t. ""Nothing? Ignatz, do you have any idea what you're asking? I left my family for you. I gave up my name, my inheritance, everything, so we could have a normal life away from their influence. I did that for you.""  
  
""And I appreciate that, Gen, I really do,"" he said, his voice softening. He stood up and came toward me, trying to take my hands. ""That's why I know you're strong enough to do this one more thing for us. For me.""  
  
He was close now, his familiar scent filling my senses. It used to comfort me. Now it made me sick.  
  
""There's something else,"" I said, my voice trembling as I backed away from his touch.  
  
He stopped, a flicker of annoyance crossing his face. ""What now?""  
  
""I'm pr\*\*nant.""  
  
The words came out, quiet but heavy. I had just found out this morning. I had been planning a romantic dinner to tell him, to celebrate.  
  
Ignatz froze. His charming expression vanished, replaced by a look I had never seen before-a cold, hard panic.  
  
""No,"" he said.  
  
""Yes. I took a test. I'm six weeks along.""  
  
He ran a hand through his perfectly styled hair, pacing the room. ""This is a disaster. An absolute disaster.""  
  
I laughed, a broken, hollow sound. Tears I didn't know were there started streaming down my face. ""A disaster? It's your baby, Ignatz.""  
  
""Everleigh can't handle this right now!"" he snapped, turning on me. ""The stress of the accident, her anxiety... finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her. She's not strong like you, Gen. She needs my full support.""  
  
""So I'm the one who gets sacrificed? Again?"" The words were squeezed out from between my teeth. ""My life, my reputation, and now... our baby?""  
  
He stopped pacing and looked at me, his eyes now holding a chilling sort of pity. ""We can't have this baby. Not now.""  
  
My world tilted. The floor felt like it was dropping out from under me. ""What are you saying?""  
  
""I'm saying you need to terminate it,"" he said, his voice dropping to a low, persuasive tone. ""It's for the best. For everyone. Once this all blows over with Everleigh, we can try again. It's just... bad timing.""  
  
The air left my lungs. He was talking about our child like it was an inconvenient appointment to be rescheduled.  
  
""It's your child, Ignatz,"" I whispered, my voice hoarse. ""Your bl\*\*d.""  
  
""And Everleigh is the woman I love!"" he yelled, his composure finally cracking. ""She's sensitive! This would break her! Can't you understand that?""  
  
I just stared at him, my mind a blank wall of pain. After a long, silent moment, a sad, twisted smile formed on my lips.  
  
""Okay,"" I said. ""Okay, Ignatz.""  
  
Relief washed over his face. He didn't see the emptiness behind my eyes.  
  
Just then, his phone rang, a cheerful pop song I recognized as one of Everleigh's hits. He answered it immediately.  
  
""Leigh? Hey, baby, what's wrong? Don't cry, I'm on my way. I'm coming right now.""  
  
His voice was a gentle, loving ca\*\*ss. A voice he hadn't used with me in years.  
  
He hung up and grabbed his keys, not even glancing at me as he rushed to the door.  
  
""I'll have my assistant schedule the appointment for you,"" he said over his shoulder. ""Just do it quickly.""  
  
Then he was gone. The door clicked shut, leaving me in a silence that was louder than his shouting.  
  
The next day, I was at the clinic. The air smelled of antiseptic and quiet despair. The nurse who took my information looked at me with pity in her eyes. It made my skin crawl.  
  
She handed me a clipboard with a consent form. His signature was already there at the bottom: Ignatz Turner. He had signed it this morning, before he even knew if I'd agree. He was so sure of me.  
  
""The doctor wants you to know,"" the nurse said softly, avoiding my gaze, ""that due to a minor complication, this procedure carries a high risk of future infertility. There's a chance you might not be able to conceive again.""  
  
The clipboard slipped from my numb fingers and clattered to the floor.  
  
He knew. He must have known. The doctor would have told his assistant, and his assistant would have told him. He knew this could leave me barren, and he still signed the form. He still sent me here to erase our child and my future.  
  
I bit down on my lip, hard. The coppery taste of bl\*\*d filled my mouth, but I felt nothing. Just a vast, cold emptiness.  
  
I was ready to go through with it. To just get it over with, to cut out the last piece of him inside me. I stood up to follow the nurse.  
  
And then I felt it.  
  
A tiny, unmistakable flutter deep in my womb. It was too early for a real kick, the doctor had said. But I felt it. A flicker of life, a silent protest.  
  
Don't let me go.  
  
""No,"" I said, my voice loud and clear in the quiet room.  
  
The nurse turned, surprised.  
  
""I'm not doing it,"" I said, pulling my arm away. ""I'm keeping my baby.""  
  
I walked out of that clinic, leaving the consent form on the floor. The afternoon sun was blindingly bright, and for a moment, I felt a surge of strength. I had my baby. That's all that mattered.  
  
Then I pulled out my phone. The screen lit up with a breaking news alert from a celebrity gossip site.  
  
The headline was a punch to the gut: ""Everleigh Hooper and Boyfriend Ignatz Turner Expecting First Child! Sources say Hooper is overjoyed after a recent health scare.""  
  
The article was filled with pictures of them from last night, leaving a fancy restaurant. Ignatz was holding her, his hand placed protectively on her flat stomach. They were both smiling, glowing for the cameras.  
  
Below the article, the comments section was a sewer.  
  
""Who is that Genevieve Ball person? The one who did the hit-and-run in Everleigh's car? Probably some obsessed fan Ignatz felt sorry for.""  
  
""I heard she's been stalking him for years. Good thing he's finally with someone on his level.""  
  
""She looks so plain. Of course he chose a star like Everleigh. And now they're starting a family! So happy for them!""  
  
I bit my lip again, harder this time. I felt the skin break, the warm trickle of bl\*\*d down my chin. But I still couldn't feel the pain. I was completely numb.  
  
I looked down at my own stomach, and a single tear rolled down my cheek and fell onto my hand.  
  
""It's okay,"" I whispered to the tiny life inside me. ""I'll protect you. I promise.""  
  
I wiped my face, my expression hardening. I opened my contacts and found my lawyer's number.  
  
""I need you to draw up divorce papers,"" I said, my voice steady and cold. ""And I want everything I'm entitled to.""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
When I got back to the apartment, the front door was slightly ajar. A knot of dread tightened in my stomach. I pushed it open slowly.  
  
The sound of soft laughter drifted from the living room.  
  
There, on the custom-made sofa I had picked out, sat Everleigh Hooper. Ignatz was sitting on the coffee table in front of her, feeding her a strawberry. She giggled and leaned forward to k\*\*s him.  
  
It was a perfectly staged, in\*\*mate moment. And I had just walked in on it.  
  
Ignatz saw me first. His smile faltered for a second, his eyes hardening. ""Gen.""  
  
Everleigh looked over, her big, innocent eyes widening. She immediately shrank back against the cushions, making herself look small and scared.  
  
""Gen, can you give us a minute?"" Ignatz said, keeping his voice low, as if I were an intruder. ""Everleigh isn't feeling well. I'll come to the guest room later.""  
  
I let out a short, sharp laugh. ""The guest room? Ignatz, this is my apartment. My name is on the lease. If anyone should leave, it's her.""  
  
He stood up, his expression turning pleading. ""Please, just for tonight. You know how she is. We grew up together, I've always taken care of her. She needs me right now.""  
  
He was trying to appeal to the part of me that had always made excuses for him, for their ""special"" bond.  
  
""I'll get her a hotel tomorrow, I promise,"" he said, his voice a low murmur. ""We'll sort this out.""  
  
I didn't say another word. I just turned and walked to the spare bedroom, closing the door behind me.  
  
I couldn't block out the sounds. A few minutes later, I heard their laughter again, louder this time, mixed with the sound of the TV. They were settling in for the night. In my home.  
  
I curled up on the bed, not bothering to change. The tears I had held back all day finally came, soaking the pillow in the dark.  
  
Much later, I heard the bedroom door creak open. A shadow fell across the bed.  
  
""Gen? Are you awake?"" It was Ignatz, his voice a guilty wh\*\*per.  
  
He sat on the edge of the bed, his weight making the mattress dip. He reached out and touched my hair.  
  
""I'm sorry about today,"" he said, his voice thick. ""It's just a lot to deal with. The baby... we'll have another one, Gen. When the time is right, I swear.""  
  
I lay perfectly still, my body rigid. He didn't know. He thought I had gone through with it. He was apologizing for the inconvenience, not the monstrous thing he had asked of me. The irony was a bitter pill in my throat.  
  
Suddenly, a sharp scream came from the living room. ""Iggy! Iggy, where are you?""  
  
Ignatz shot up from the bed as if he'd been electrocuted. ""Leigh?""  
  
""I had a nightmare!"" she wailed. ""Come back!""  
  
Without a second thought, without another glance at me, he bolted from the room. ""I'm coming, Leigh! I'm here!""  
  
For the rest of the night, the sound of his low, soothing voice drifted down the hallway as he comforted her, leaving me alone in the dark.  
  
The next morning, I dragged my exhausted body out of bed. The smell of coffee and bacon filled the air. For a delusional second, it felt like any other morning.  
  
Then I walked into the kitchen.  
  
Ignatz was at the stove, flipping pancakes. Everleigh was perched on a stool, wearing one of his expensive silk shirts, her bare legs dangling. She was laughing as he playfully dabbed a bit of whipped cream on her nose.  
  
They looked like a happy couple in a coffee commercial. I was the ghost haunting the set.  
  
Everleigh saw me and her bright smile vanished. She instantly adopted her frightened-doe look, clutching Ignatz's arm. ""Oh. Genevieve. You're up.""  
  
""Iggy,"" she whispered, loud enough for me to hear. ""I want orange juice. Freshly squeezed.""  
  
""Of course, Leigh. Anything you want,"" Ignatz said, turning to the fridge without a single glance in my direction.  
  
The moment he was busy with the juicer, Everleigh's entire demeanor changed. The fear melted away, replaced by a smug, triumphant smirk. She looked directly at me.  
  
""He was so disappointed when he thought you were pr\*\*nant,"" she said, her voice a syrupy poison. ""He told me he never wanted kids with you. He said the thought of it made his skin crawl.""  
  
I froze, my hand on the counter. My head snapped up to look at her. My fingers trembled.  
  
""You think you can win?"" she continued, her voice dripping with contempt. ""I'm Everleigh Hooper. My uncle is one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood. Who are you? A no-name architect he picked up out of pity.""  
  
My bl\*\*d ran cold. I knew her uncle was influential. I hadn't realized how much. That's why Ignatz was so desperate to protect her. It wasn't just love; it was ambition. She was his ticket to a world he craved.  
  
Suddenly, Everleigh let out a sharp cry and slid off the stool, collapsing onto the floor. ""Ahh! My ankle!"" she shrieked, clutching it. ""Genevieve, why did you push me?""  
  
Ignatz spun around, his face a mask of fury. He saw me standing near her, saw her on the floor, and didn't hesitate. He lunged forward and shoved me, hard.  
  
""What the h\*\*l is wrong with you?"" he roared.  
  
I stumbled backward, my hip slamming into the corner of the kitchen island. A sharp, searing pain shot through my side. I gasped, clutching the spot.  
  
He didn't even notice. He was already on the floor, cradling Everleigh in his arms. ""Are you okay, Leigh? Did she hurt you?""  
  
He looked up at me, his eyes filled with a cold, terrifying hatred. ""She's fragile, you id\*\*t! I told you that!""  
  
""I... I didn't touch her,"" I stammered, the pain making my voice shake.  
  
""Get out of my sight,"" he snarled, his voice low and dangerous. ""Don't you ever touch her again. I'm warning you, Genevieve.""  
  
He scooped Everleigh up into his arms and carried her out of the kitchen, leaving me standing there, trembling with pain and shock.  
  
My hand went instinctively to my stomach, a silent prayer that the baby was okay.  
  
This was my home. And I had just been declared the enemy.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
Ignatz didn't come back for two days. I spent the time in a daze, moving through the silent apartment like a zombie. I took down our pictures, packing his clothes into boxes. I even took off my wedding ring. It slid off my finger with no resistance. I had lost so much weight, I hadn't even noticed.  
  
I dropped it into the tr\*\*h can. It made a dull, final thud.  
  
Then, a text message from him lit up my phone.  
  
Can you do me a favor? There's a blue velvet box in my top drawer. A courier is coming to pick it up in an hour. Have it ready for him.  
  
I went to his drawer. Inside was a small, elegant box from a famous jewelry designer. I opened it. Nestled on the black velvet was a diamond necklace, the kind of ostentatious piece I would never wear. I remembered him showing it to me online months ago.  
  
""Isn't it beautiful?"" he'd said. ""I'm going to buy it for the most important person in my life.""  
  
I had thought he meant me.  
  
Staring at the necklace, a bitter laugh escaped my lips. I closed the box.  
  
When the courier arrived, a young man in a crisp uniform, I handed him the package without a word.  
  
""Ma'am, the destination is the St. Regis Hotel,"" he said, confirming the details.  
  
""I know,"" I said, pulling my purse from the hook by the door. I took out the folded divorce agreement. ""I'm going with you.""  
  
The car ride was silent. The St. Regis was hosting a massive press conference for Everleigh's new movie. As we pulled up, I could hear the roar of the crowd and the frantic clicking of cameras.  
  
I walked into the ballroom. The noise died down instantly. Every head turned. Every camera swiveled to face me. I was wearing a simple dress and no makeup. My hair was pulled back in a messy bun.  
  
Whispers erupted around me.  
  
""Is that her? The stalker?""  
  
""What is she doing here? Look at how she's dressed. No class.""",2,1753609225.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

I've always been the one to be fatigued all the time, i remember before my diagnosis i told my coworkers don't ask me how i am, you know im always tired. But back then i thought i was just tired, lack of sleep , too much sleep, lack of exercise , lack of vitamins. 

I could deal with my fatigue better when i didn't know that i had MS compared to after i knew. Because now internally I've given myself a reason , and I've given up. Even if i don't feel that i have, but it's true.

Im noticing it so much more, im absolutely exhausted. I just woke up after a 10 hr sleep , and getting up to the bathroom and to the kitchen to make coffee was more tiring that it should be.

What's the solution ? Something that actually works, what can i do??
Caffeine? Healthy food? Do i pump vitamin pills by the mouthful? Decrease my screen time (cz im glued to my phone) ?? Exercising? I try going on walks but i can't think of anything other than how i cant wait till i find somewhere to rest. Im almost 26, i can't be wasting my 20s resting and lazing around and sleeping all the time! But im always so damn tired 

I hope someone has a trick that decreases the fatigue , give me all you've got I'll try them all

Dad and I went for brunch this morning, it was such a pretty countryside drive. I had poached eggs on grilled sourdough with a couple bits of halloumi and spinach and it was *delightful*. My coffee was quite bitter but still fine enough to drink. And then I took pup for a little wander through the town and park for 30 minutes while dad read the paper and waited. I saw some beautiful monarch butterflies just fluttering about the grass and flowers in the park and I loved it. I tried to take a nice photo but it’s hard when you have a psycho dog yanking on the lead.

I think I will go home tomorrow. Probably. I don’t know. Maybe not. I don’t know. 

I want a Mulberry Alexa. I want a burgundy coloured one with gold hardware and I want it BADLY. I love how slouchy it is. I think it looks extra nice when it’s not done up.

1mai4e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ellykatstans/comments/1mai4e7/paul_blart_hive_and_let_die/,Paul Blart: Hive and Let Die,"For two blissful days, the mall buzzed only with credit card swipes and the smell of Cinnabon. The Wasp Queen was down, the swarm scattered, and Blart had earned his breakroom donut of honor (glazed, with sprinkles).

But evil never dies quietly.

It started with the alarms.

Motion detectors in the sub-basement where nobody goes except rats, rumors, and the guy who restocks the massage chairs started blinking red. Gary’s mop water boiled. A child claimed to have seen “a bee with arms” in the escalator reflection.

Then came the hum. Deeper now. Mechanical. Unified.

The swarm was back.

But this wasn’t chaos.

This was organized.

At 3:00 a.m., the mall lights blacked out. The security cameras flickered with static and glitchy text: **“THE HIVE RISES.”**

Blart dropped his coffee.

“Gary,” he said grimly. “They learned.”

He was right.

The wasps had evolved. Foam had failed. They wore armor now—plastic bits from drone kits, mannequin limbs for exoskeletons. The Wasp Queen? Still alive. Reinforced. Rewired. And angrier than ever.

But Paul Blart had changed, too.

He hadn’t told anyone not even Gary about the sting he’d gotten during the first war. The one that didn’t swell, but shimmered. That night he’d heard buzzing—not from outside, but *within*. His dreams were made of honeycomb. His sense of smell sharpened. He tasted the mall air and knew someone at Sunglass Hut had opened a grape soda.

By day two, Paul Blart was no longer *just* human.

He was part bee.

He kept it quiet. He didn’t want to freak anyone out. He trimmed his new antennae. Hid the wings under his jacket. He still wore the badge. But now… he *felt* the hive.

And he knew the Queen wasn’t done.

**Phase 1: The Trap.** He rerouted the HVAC system to blast peppermint oil and vinegar through the ducts Wasp Kryptonite.

**Phase 2: The Lure.** He stacked honey buns from the food court in the atrium, surrounded by mannequins dressed like Blart and hidden speakers blasting “Flight of the Bumblebee.”

**Phase 3: The Finale.** He called in every debt, every friend mall goths, pretzel twisters, even the Buzz & Bubble lady who returned with bath bombs laced with menthol and glitter.

The mall was a fortress.

But even so… the wasps came.

Thousands of them.

The Queen rose, wings made of tinsel and recycled gift card plastic, her voice now a metallic screech from every speaker in the mall:

**“YOU DARED STING THE HIVE. NOW FEEL THE STING… OF EVOLUTION.”**

Paul cracked his knuckles. His jacket fluttered slightly buzzing beneath.

“You talk too much.”

She dove.

He leapt.

But instead of dodging, **Paul flew.**

Wings unfurled sleek, golden-black, shimmering under the skylight. The Segway lifted with him, rigged now with ducted fans and honey-powered turbines. His eyes glowed faintly hexagonal.

Gary nearly dropped his mop.

“Dude’s a bee.”

Blart spiraled upward and dove, faster than a drone, unleashing glitter bombs and peppermint bursts mid-flight. He dipped and weaved like a hornet on espresso, stinger darts clipped to his belt.

The mall erupted into war.

Nerf guns fired anti-venom packets. Teens rode scooters into wasp legions. Mopzilla whirled like a sudsy storm. A Build-A-Bear bear detonated next to a vending machine, screaming, “FOR THE FOOD COURT!”

And in the chaos Paul Blart, buzzing at the speed of justice, collided with the Wasp Queen midair in front of Macy’s.

They spun, tangled in glitter and static.

She hissed: “You’re not human anymore.”

He grinned. “Better. I’m mall cop *and* drone.”

He flipped the karaoke system on. One final track: **“I Will Survive.”**

It blared through the atrium.

But Blart wasn't just playing music. He was transmitting *vibrating on the hive’s frequency*. He danced, ancient bee moves pulsing through the tile floor. Wild bees stirred from behind gumball machines. They joined him.

The Queen screeched. Her swarm staggered.

Then Blart did the unthinkable.

He buzzed forward, midair, and unleashed his final weapon: a custom canister of peppermint cooking foam… delivered *directly into the Queen’s face*.

She shrieked.

She sparked.

And she exploded into tinsel, glitter, and pure, buzzing rage.

**Silence.**

Then… cheers. Applause. Someone yelled, “Buzz Blart saves the mall!”

Paul landed softly, folding his wings back into his shirt.

Gary approached slowly. “You good, man?”

Blart nodded. “Just… pollen-sensitive now.”

Later, as the sun rose, he planted something new on the rooftop flagpole:

A golden wasp sculpture pierced by a candy cane.

Below it, a plaque read:

“STUNG ONCE. NEVER AGAIN.”

And the scary part is: most people there seem completely fine with it.

From banning cash payments over €1000 in France, to EU-wide digital regulations that demand proactive censorship and speech policing, to the expanding web of hate speech laws that can punish not just public speech but also memes, jokes, or satire. Europe is becoming a sanitized surveillance state with nice buildings and good coffee. Everything is framed as “protecting people,” but no one stops to ask: who protects us from the protectors? Once you hand that power to the state, you don’t get it back.

In many European countries, self-defense is practically illegal. Firearms for personal protection are nearly impossible to acquire. Even pepper spray is banned or heavily restricted. And yet, Europeans often laugh at Americans for wanting gun rights as if carrying a firearm for protection is more absurd than walking around with car keys between your fingers. But hey, at least you won’t get arrested for owning a butter knife in your bag.

The cost of this “safety-first” culture? Stagnation. Brain drain. Irrelevance. Europe has some of the highest taxes, most inflexible labor markets, and slowest bureaucracies in the developed world. You can feel it. Ambitious young people leave. Startups die before they begin. Creativity is boxed in by red tape, speech codes, and centralized controls.

proof? Out of the top 50 global tech companies, only four are European. That’s not a coincidence. Meanwhile, the U.S. is home to Apple, Google, Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta, and more because despite its flaws, it still allows people to take risks and say what they believe.

And what do most Europeans focus on? Soccer. That’s the national obsession. Not free speech, not innovation, not sovereignty. They make fun of Americans for “guns and burgers,” but they’re fine with living under a digital nanny state as long as the national team qualifies for the Euros.

Europe is peaceful and relatively stable, for now. But it’s also sterile, culturally risk-averse, and increasingly allergic to real freedom. You don’t build the future by making everyone “safe.” You build it by being free and that means tolerating risk, discomfort, and even offense. Europe forgot that.

1mahwpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1mahwpd/long_time/,Long time,"10 years ago I was living with a beautiful girl I loved. I was shopping rings to ask her to marry me when she found out and broke up with me. Married someone else just a few short months later. I’ve been single ever since. I’ve only had 1 date in that entire time which went terribly. 10 fucking years. I have been desperately trying to date again for the last few months but I can’t get any women to even look at me. I’ve tried every dating app under the sun, been to countless meet ups, being out and about more, going into random stores and food spots, being all smiley and upbeat looking so I seem approachable, book stores, coffee shops, museums, parks, AA meetings, Al-Anon meetings, various classes, and way more. Fucking everything. It’s literally what all of my spare time has gone to for several months. None of it matters. I used to think I was at least somewhat easy on the eyes, but definitely not anymore. I know I’m ugly now. I’ve accepted I’m never going to get a girl again. I didn’t want some bombshell type either. Just a nice sweet cute girl that likes me for me. I can’t remember the last time one looked at me and didn’t instantly look away. This is soul crushing loneliness, and I’m simply unwilling to do this. After over 10 years, enough is enough. I’m almost 40, my parents are gone now,and I don’t talk to my siblings. I only have one friend, but he doesn’t live in my city so we only talk via text. I’m completely alone all of the time. If it wasn’t for my cats I’d have left this bitch already, but that’s just not enough anymore. So this week I found someone willing to adopt them. I also cashed out the meager investments I had. I live in a major city, and I have taken to crossing the street without looking hoping to get hit. I really didn’t know I was so undesirable before I started trying to date again, but the ladies have shown me the error in my judgement very clearly. They can smell the loser on me 10 blocks away. It sincerely feels like since I’m not some 6’4” wealthy adonis none of them are willing to acknowledge I exist. Almost made it to 40, but ended up being a dumb ugly unsuccessful loser instead.

But Persona (3Reload and 5Royal) have enthralled me. 

Firstly, they are great travel p*rn. I adore Tokyo and wandering around the backstreets,  staring out from the Shibuya crossway is my jam.

More important, I'm impressed with how it deals with very serious problems (the gym teacher abuses are really strong stuff) despite the cheerful, sometimes cute, animation.

The general themes - abuse of the powerless by the powerful, particularly of the young by the old, is incredibly resonant.

The social link mechanic is inspired. There's great variety: battle in  Tartarus/palaces, then back to daily life.

They are not just battle after battle after battle.

They revere coffee.

They are not perfect. There are a few storylines or incidents which had me rolling my eyes, but its always interesting and - this is praise - it can be really weird. Demons on toilets, and animated genitals? OK. Why not?

Finally, I was genuinely moved by parts, especially the ending of P3R (which I reached a couple of days back).

A top Indonesian official said South-east Asia’s largest economy is seeking zero per cent tariff from trade deals with the European Union, which has 27 member countries.

It is also seeking a separate agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union, said Mr Susiwijono Moegiarso, the most senior bureaucrat at Indonesia’s Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs. The members of the Eurasian grouping are Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia.

Indonesia is, additionally, accelerating to ratify a December 2024 comprehensive economic partnership agreement (Cepa) with Canada, he told a panel discussion in Jakarta on July 22, organised by Bank UOB Indonesia.

“In the past two weeks, we have been travelling to a number of countries... and we have achieved concrete results,” he had said at the session.

The US has set a 19 per cent tariff on most goods from Indonesia under a new agreement. Certain goods, including processed nickel, coffee beans and others that are not produced by the US, may get a lower rate.

I'm a 27 years old female. A few weeks ago, I had a really intense and scary episode that seemed to kick all of this off. Out of nowhere, I suddenly felt extremely nervous, I felt pressure in the back of my head, ears and chest and I felt like I was about to die. My body felt hot and heavy, I had to lie down for over 1h because every time I wanted to stand up or sit down I felt I'd faint. Since then, things haven’t gone back to normal — and I’m now dealing with daily symptoms that are hard to explain and manage.

Here’s what I’ve been experiencing:

I suddenly start sweating, feel a pressure deep in my ears, sometimes also in my chest or throat.

My appetite disappears, I feel nauseous, and my body gets heavy, like I’m about to faint.

I often feel the urge to poop after these episodes start — but I’m not sure if that’s a trigger or just another symptom.

Sexual arousal also triggers strange symptoms (ear and chest/throat pressure and heat, ringing in ears), and I’ve been avoiding climax out of fear it could trigger a more severe episode.

Things get much worse after drinking coffee — especially pressure in the ears, top of the head, and a strong sense of internal agitation or heat.

Before this, I drank coffee regularly with no issues, I felt bad after climax though, especially if it happened while standing. I always had to lie down because I felt I would pass out. I do have a history of migraines and I regularly notice undigested food in my stool, but I’m not sure that’s connected.

Since that first intense episode, I’ve been feeling like my body overreacts to normal things — like my nervous system is stuck in some kind of overdrive or shutdown loop.

Could this be a form of dysautonomia, vagus nerve hypersensitivity, or something else related to the autonomic nervous system? I’ve read a bit about vasovagal responses, but this feels more widespread and persistent.

I’ve now completely cut out caffeine to see if that helps, and I’m trying to stay as calm and grounded as I can, but I still feel like something is deeply off.

I’d really appreciate any insights, similar stories, or advice on what I should ask a doctor. This has been very distressing and I just want to understand what’s going on with my body.

1mahodm,https://i.redd.it/9e2ppj5utdff1.jpeg,"First wild camping with my son, looking for recommendations on best camping spot for us. TIA.","Hi folks,

Looking for a bit of advice from anyone who knows southern Scotland. Me and my son (just the two of us) are planning a little wild camping trip in mid-August, somewhere around Galloway or nearby. We’re based in Manchester so we don’t want to drive more than 3 to 3.5 hours really, and he picked Galloway from a little map we made together, so that’s the rough area we’re aiming for.

A bit of background: over the past 7-8 years we’ve done quite a few camping trips, mainly at campsites, sometimes really basic ones without electric, so we’re not total strangers to roughing it. We both love the outdoors, going on big walks, picnics, being out in nature all day. But this time my son wants to try proper wild camping. He’s been talking about it for ages.

He’s got autism and ADHD, and honestly when he’s outside he’s at his absolute best. Calm, happy, regulated and he loves it. He recently got really into games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, and he’s been obsessed with the idea of wild camping (thanks to the scenery of these games), campfires, mountains, Highlands, Vikings, all of it.

So, that’s what we’re trying to do. Just two nights somewhere we can:
	•	Wild camp without bothering anyone (that’s why we are looking at anywhere in Scotland first) 
	•	Sit around a small campfire (we’ll keep it tiny and safe, and of course leave no trace)
	•	Go on good long walks nearby and rough rigid landscape
	•	And most importantly, avoid the midges as much as possible (I know he won’t be able to cope with them very well and it might ruin the whole thing)

I know it’s August so midges are expected, and we will be bringing Smidge, citronella sticks and candles, head nets, Avon skin so soft, all that. But I’ve been reading loads of stuff and everyone says something different (there are comments from people who lived in the area for 7 years and not seen a Midge once to people who had to abandon camping due to the swarms)... I get that it depends on the weather and the location, but we’d love to find a spot where they’re not too bad, ideally near the coast or up high where there’s a breeze.

We’re happy to walk/hike 2-3 hours after parking, and fine with climbing a bit. we’re both pretty mobile and up for the adventure. I’ve just really struggled to find clear, specific info on where you can actually go and camp like this. Everything online is a bit vague or contradicts something else. I asked GPT and it doesn’t have a clue… it’s just making up places. 

So if anyone knows of a good spot in or near Galloway (or anywhere else really)  that would suit a quiet wild camp, I’d be massively grateful. Doesn’t need to be anything fancy, just somewhere we can have our little fire, do our marshmallows and read cowboy tales by the fire, camp out, walk around, and make a memory or two.

Happy to buy you a thank you coffee or two if you point us in the right direction. Cheers in advance!",5,1753606966.0,wildcampingintheuk,8,0.63,False

My appetite disappears, I feel nauseous, and my body gets heavy, like I’m about to faint.

I often feel the urge to poop after these episodes start — but I’m not sure if that’s a trigger or just another symptom.

Sexual arousal also triggers strange symptoms (ear and chest/throat pressure and heat, ringing in ears), and I’ve been avoiding climax out of fear it could trigger a more severe episode.

Things get much worse after drinking coffee — especially pressure in the ears, top of the head, and a strong sense of internal agitation or heat.


Before this, I drank coffee regularly with no issues, I felt bad after climax though, especially if it happened while standing. I always had to lie down because I felt I would pass out. I do have a history of migraines and I regularly notice undigested food in my stool, but I’m not sure that’s connected.

Since that first intense episode, I’ve been feeling like my body overreacts to normal things — like my nervous system is stuck in some kind of overdrive or shutdown loop.

Could this be a form of dysautonomia, vagus nerve hypersensitivity, or something else related to the autonomic nervous system? I’ve read a bit about vasovagal responses, but this feels more widespread and persistent.

I’ve now completely cut out caffeine to see if that helps, and I’m trying to stay as calm and grounded as I can, but I still feel like something is deeply off.

I’d really appreciate any insights, similar stories, or advice on what I should ask a doctor. This has been very distressing and I just want to understand what’s going on with my body. I visited a general practice doctor and she prescribed some lab tests. Turned out my ferritin was very low and vitamin d a little low.

1mahmfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/RimWorld/comments/1mahmfz/medieval_overhaul_patches_problem/,Medieval Overhaul Patches Problem,"So, I've used the Medieval Overhaul mod for awhile and it's patches. It worked just fine for me before Odyssey and the only thing that has changed since that came out are the mods AAAAAAA Safe Zones and Faction Control, neither of which should be causing the problem I am having... currently, when I slot Medieval Overhaul Patches into my modlist, my worlds generate with NO plants of any kind. Nothing. Just soil and tears, yo.  I tried moving MOP down to the bottom of the list, and that still didn't fix it and for the life of me I can't figure out what it would be conflicting with so if anyone would be willing to take a look at my modlist, I'd be really grateful.  Currently I have MOP off of the modlist until I can figure out exactly why it's borking the way it is.  Thanks in advance for any help!

Txt msgs to share the day and the fact the little things do matter. I’ve got a quirky sense of humor and a penchant for puns and dad jokes, a keen wit, minimal filter and speak fluent sarcasm. According to a few trusted sources, (my circle of friends) I’m worth the effort, but I’ll let you be the judge. 👩‍⚖️

You? Emotionally available, honest, transparent AF and not into playing games. Age isn’t a dealbreaker, but I tend to connect best with women younger than me. Physically, I’m 6’0 and around 195-200 lb so, height/weight proportionate and hope you are too.

I should mention that I am left and liberal, not sure if that is a red flag or green one but wanted to mention it.. I am not overly political but do care about my environment and also how other human beings are being treated in today’s times, if you voted maga or admire DJT please don’t respond. Thx. 

Some other things about me, (you can decide the flag colors) 🤣 not a sportsball fan, I enjoy watching a random game but that’s about it. My main interests are movies and tech, travel, photography, cooking, music, writing and deep conversation, I like to do for others and am big on animal rights too. I am more introverted vs extroverted, not a big fan of drinking or recreational drugs but do enjoy a good scotch occasionally or an edible or gummy (I don’t smoke).  

Love cheese, not a fan of spicy foods and love a good cup of coffee and especially the whole roasting and brewing process itself. (fun fact even took a part time job in a small roaster to learn all the background) Im a taurus fwiw.. Beach over mountains, dogs over cats, naps, nocturnal, sleeping in, singing in the car, there is a high possibility of my taking your hand and dancing with you randomly for no reason other than the pleasure of your company. Oh and if you haven’t picked up on it yet, I tend to ramble 😉

Looking for a woman who genuinely cares about people, knows how to communicate, and both values and exercises honesty. If that sounds like you, let’s talk and see where things go.

I am looking to start here then move to discord or something for voice chat once we have chatted here for a bit first, Your DM should tell me about you with age and geo location and your interests, your picture gets mine in response.  

Im not open to crypto, and I will not send you itunes or target gift cards for your neighbors grandmother’s surgery or what ever garbage scam is the latest trend so no thank you, don’t waste energy on me if you are not real, thanks!  If you are real, what are ya waiting for? Get that chat invite going, and let me hear about you! :)  Looking forward to hearing from you!

Hey there!!! 🥰 I wanted to share something super special I’ve been dreaming up—this magical, heart-melting place called  the Cuddle Wing cafe a cozy little fairy café that’s all about love, comfort and  cuteness! 😭🧚‍♀️
This isn’t your average coffee shop.
This is where you go when your soul needs a soft blanket and a cookie the size of your face. 🍪💞
In this café, you don’t just order hot cocoa or pastries… you also get to cuddle with CHUBBY FAIRIES. YES. Soft, round, beautifully pampered fairies that wear pajamas, robes, and crop tops to show off their adorable bellies 🥺✨
You can: 🍫 Feed them brownie bites and watch their cheeks puff up in bliss
🧸 Let them nap on your chest while it rains outside
💋 Kiss their cheeks and hear tiny “mrrrhh~” squeaks
🎶 Sing them lullabies while they squish into your lap
🤲 Gently rub their tummies and give them warm back massages
💤 And just hold them. Hold them close. Because they love you. 😭💖
These fairies are treated like royalty. They’re spoiled with desserts, pampered daily, brushed and groomed, and surrounded by love. Some were rescued from harsh places… and this cafe became their safe haven. And when you visit? You become a part of that gentle magic too.
The whole café smells like warm vanilla There’s lofi music playing. The lights are soft. And the moment you walk in, you feel like you’re wrapped in a cinnamon-scented hug. 🍯☁️
You'll  meet Fairies like: 
🌙 Snuggleplum – Sleepy, round, and hums lullabies while curled on your shoulder
🌸 Koemi – A sweet, shy Asian fairy in cherry blossom pajamas, full of quiet warmth
🍓 Thimblekiss – Over-the-top affectionate and loves belly rubs more than life
🍫 Velvette – A gentle, cocoa-skinned cuddle queen who speaks in whispers and melts into your hands
And more are waiting to meet you 😭💕
This café is a safe space for softness. For healing. For just being warm and loved with a fairy cuddled against your cheek and a brownie in your mouth.

✨ Would you visit this place?✨

Doctor diagnosed me with PCOS and prescribed me with hormonal treatment. I'm happy that I finally get some answers and the help I need because I was feeling anemic and wasn't able to work or live properly. I need to lose weight but I got overwhelmed and now and then, I have a bad mindset about diet and losing weight. Sometimes I feel bad after eating and broke down. Lately, I admit that I use food to comfort myself from stress. On another hand, eating healthy can be expensive and need a lot of effort to plan one. I'm a bit loss on how to restructure my diet and sleep schedule.

I have difficulty with my sleeping and eating schedule. Sometimes I can't sleep, and relued on coffee to be awake for work. My eating is sporadic as well. I miss breakfast or have brunch or have late lunch and late dinner. It took a toll on my body sometimes.

Financially, I don't have much savings. After I got this new job, I've been helping my family. My brother's tuition fees, my mom's utilities, my dad's moving out fees. I kinda envy my colleagues that they don't have much commitments and are able to save a lot monthly.

Family wise, I've been closer to my mom. I've been helping her financially and sometimes help her with chores. Her love language is to cook and gosh her cooking is amazing. I found myself overeat ate her place. I haven't been close to my dad. I feel like we've been getting distant over time. I just don't know what to talk to him. I don't trust my parents with my issues or thoughts because I don't really agree with their way of solving things. Sometimes I'd get even more stress talking to my mom about my issues most probably from her anxiety disorder. Sometimes I don't feel heard when I talk to my dad about my issues most probably because he struggles with emotional stuff. As for my brother, we don't really talk much but we understand that we both wants our own independence and space. All of us has different lifestyle, different principles of life, different approach to problems. It gets overwhelming now and then without family supports. My brother attempted suicide few days ago. Again. I tried to offer to pay for a counselling session online for him but he doesn't want it. I guess he doesn't want my help. But my mom is having a breakdown because she thought that his attempt is because of her. 

I'm behind work and my masters work. I have been occupied with work and life that I haven't been able to work on my research paper or my dissertation. I've been slowly catching up with house chores tho.

What pushed me to make this post is two acne-like bumps on my arm I noticed today, (I will attach pictures). I've never had anything like that on anywhere other than my face before.

I also read that people who are deficient in vitamin c don't tend to show symptoms for a few months. Maybe these are the beginning of my symptoms as I have been doing the diet for 2 months?

For more info, my diet has exclusively been fatty mince beef, eggs, wild salmon, chicken and occasionally some cheese. Also for the last few weeks I have been drinking coffee again.

I'm really not sure, some help from people who have experienced a similar thing or you guys who have been doing the diet for years who are more knowledgeable would really help me out, thanks.",2,1753605481.0,carnivorediet,14,0.75,False

1mah8qd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mah8qd,"Fuck the leaks sub, im gonna tell yall why i think these latest rounds of Death Star rumors are fake and why you should still believe that the model will be a spherical design.","EXHIBIT 1:  comparing the rumoured model to the table and the UCS Gunship

first of all, why am i including the UCS Gunship on this round coffee table, well actually this round table the model is sitting on is 70cm in diameter EXACTLY. So realistically speaking with the rumoured diameter of the death star being 70cm, this shows a comparison on how big the model will be. A 3000 piece set can achieve the dimensions of a 9000 piece set, difference: height (get into exhibit 3)

EXHIBIT2: diagram analysis

Now this drawing i made on onenote showcases on how the currently rumoured model will roughly look. The stand will have to be centred in a weird spot which will give an ugly look to the bottom of the model. Since this hypothetical model is not a complete half sphere, there will be some dead space within the model to hold the whole structure up and not to forget the stand that will most likely be built into the model using up valuable interior space, however i didnt show that in the diagram.
While the design for the set could work, it almost certainly does not warrant 9000 pieces just for the sheer volume of stuff your getting for your money even in this economy. What rules this out is again the fact that if LEGO would attempt something like this, they would go for a complete half sphere to make the sides of the model more sturdy and make it more clean instead of being about 40% there.

Believe it or not but if this is true, you are actually gonna get exactly what the same volume of stuff as 75159. Again, 9000 pieces does not warrant 40% a sphere.



EXHIBIT 3: a real chance for error

First of all we can rule out Brick News and Itavix Bricks since they repost leaks and not actual leakers so they have no relevance in this scenario.

All the reliable LEGO leakers have not seen pics of the Death Star with Brick Clicker doing a speculative post on his instagram story, Get Cooped is straight up confused about this and Max Baut outright saying he hasnt seen the model on his latest youtube video. The rumoured model dimensions are 79cmx70cmx27cm with Get Cooped thinking that the model itself is 79cm wide and 70cm long with the height of 27cm prompting them to think it’s a literal coffee table diorama. Others such as Max Baut and Childish Landino say the model could be 79cm tall, 70cm diameter and 27cm deep. These dimensions are all over the place and the only info they all possess at the current moment is the model dimensions and thats it. Since pretty much the half sphere model is ruled out and the possibility for a UCS Death Star being a rectangular diorama is incredibly low unless its labelled as MBS (if that was the case, we would have known that months ago) 


so what is the error you may ask, well if you swap 27cm to 72cm it becomes clear. Typos like these are quite common in the LEGO leak community last example from star wars was the sailbarge piece count (3249 pieces instead of 3942) and im sure there have been others from other sets in other themes across the years. 
Back to the leakers saying its 27cm deep, their source is likely the culprit for the potential typo which inadvertently tricked them and everyone by a simple mistake. (I dont know exactly what goes on behind those closed doors but im sure that scenario is like a game of Chinese Whispers with that source likely getting the info via another source  and so on until it leads to LEGO).

So in the end it is a strong possibility that this was indeed a typo and we could be looking at a true $1000 beast that measures 79cm tall x 70cm wide and 72cm deep.

Going back to the gunship, the model measures 32cm high so for some reason it just seems off that a 9000 piece model would be shorter in one dimension than the gunship. As i said thats a weird comparison, but a valid one which us why i further think thats the most possible answer.


EXHIBIT 4: the business standpoint.

For a $1000 lego star wars UCS set, people are gonna expect the best of the best when it comes to the Death Star build. I bet if asked you in person “What makes a $1000 Death Star?” 90+% of people would answer the same thing. A giant complete spherical model with a full interior and panelling and room for a shit tonne of minifigs. 
If the model is in the vein of what Get Cooped is speculating, this model will sell like shit just cause it does nkt resemble a Death Star UCS model let alone Max Baut’s idea with 40% a death star with a goofy design. It works for sets like the Pyramid, like Disney Castle, like Barad Dur because the front of the model does a good job hiding the facade of the back being completely open. If the half death star model is true, it would immediately lose its presence as a centrepiece display model since again the model is not a complete half sphere and would look silly and would therefore sell like shit.



So this is my breakdown, comparing the hypothetical model to sets of similar size/volume, analysing the potential for the 27cm measurement being an actual typo and just looking at it from a business standpoint sometimes helps.

I have done 2 posts about this on the legostarwarsleaks sub and somehow it got taken down due to “being a similar post to someone else's”. Have i convinced you yet, if not well we will just have to wait and see at this point. 

If i’m wrong, then you can jerk on me all you want but if i’m somehow right, this would be the funniest shit of the century! Hope yall have a great week and happy jerking!

1mah8aq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mah8aq,How to take self portraits?,"Let's start with the important stuff: 
Pentax K1000 ✔️
35mm and 50mm lens ✔️ 
Self-release cable ✔️ 
Tripod ❌ (but on the list)
Autoknips self timer ❌ (one day)

I'd appreciate some tips on how to take self-portraits while in front of the camera, not behind it. I'm very much a beginner, and I mostly shoot buildings (love the lines and geometry). I've experimented somewhat with self-portraits in front of the camera but they've been mostly miss. I generally prefer close-ups of shoulders/neck, waist etc. The artsy fartsy stuff. Also because of the self-release cable... In lieu of a tripod I've managed a great setup with coffee tables and books. Works surprisingly well haha. 

The few I've taken I actually quite like, except they're not in focus. I set up the camera at the preferred height, identified a focus point, got the camera to focus, then posed in front of, and behind the focus spot. I've had one photo where the focus was kinda in the spot I aimed for (see attached photo, I posed just behind the focus spot), but the next one was not, despite posing the same way again. 

I can only post the one photo where it's kinda in focus, the failed ones show a little more skin than I'm comfortable sharing here.

Am I missing something incredibly simple? Am I an idiot? I'm not seeking composition advice, just some tips on where to position myself to have the highest chance of the photo being in focus. 

I don't mind the failed ones btw, it's a learning process, and they're composed in ways I'd like to recreate successfully.

Thank you!!

I'm also attaching one other photo that as a beginner I'm super proud of. Taken during early evening on Fuji 200 - but forgot my camera was still set to ISO 400. I always slightly overexpose anyway. Not looking for comments on it btw :)",3,1753605192.0,AnalogCommunity,6,1.0,False

It’s not just about pouring drinks I’ve been trained in roasting, latte art, inventory, managing shifts, all of it. I actually really love it, and I’m planning to eventually open a little shop of my own.

My aunt, though, is constantly putting me down. Every time we see each other, she makes comments like “When are you going to get a real job?” or “Still doing the coffee thing?” I usually just laugh it off or change the subject, but at a family lunch last weekend, she said in front of everyone: “You’re too smart to waste your life frothing milk. I thought you’d grow out of that phase.”

I was already annoyed, but that one hit a nerve. I looked her straight in the eye and said, “It’s not a phase. I make more than enough to live, I enjoy what I do, and not everyone has to sit behind a desk to be successful.”

She got all huffy and left the table, and now some relatives are saying I embarrassed her and should’ve just let it go. I don’t think I was rude, just honest. But now the vibe is weird.

Quick backstory: I have an assistant manager at my store who is extremely rude to everyone. If you don't do what she says, she punishes you by being rude or cutting your hours. For example, someone called in sick one day because they hurt their hand, but decided to pick up a shift the next day. The manager said Don't bother comming in tomorrow.

She shows strange favoritism towards certain employees, by which I mean she flirts with them in the middle of the store, where everyone can hear. And then, a couple of months later, those same employees get promoted. While I do think one of those employees deserved to be promoted because they worked hard, it still seemed suspicious. She gets mad at employees for not working fast enough and doesn't offer to help. She had been angry with several people, but they just kept quiet because they were afraid of her. When I showed up and started calling her out, she got mad at me. For example, I trained an individual and asked her several times not to schedule me during the busiest time, but she kept putting me in during the busiest hours, made sure there weren't enough people working on the floor. It all came to a head when I was training two people during a busy shift. Coffee had spilled, and I still had one hour left to train them on how to make all the drinks - I couldn't do it during our last shift because we didn't have enough people, and they needed me most of the time.

Anyway, when coffee spilled, she asked me to clean it up. I asked her to give me a second because I was teaching the new crew something. She insisted and said Clean it now, make one of your trainees. I told her they don't know how it was a big spill, and I didn't want them dragging coffee everywhere (plus you know how some people are genuinely clueless when it comes to cleaning spills and make more of a mess) I asked her one more time to please give me a second, she said Watch your tone.

All I could think was me? Watch my tone? The person who\`s been rude to so many people in the store? The person whose behavior caused others to quit or think about quitting? The person whom other managers dislike because of their attitude, and who has had several verbal arguments with people? Me?

So I reported her. She's so mean that I`ve seen people crash out from the stress of her attitude. I also made sure I wasn`t the only on who felt this, as at least 10 crew members feel the same way

Remember when we used to just... drink coffee? Yeah, me neither. So I built **Coffee Shot Timer** - because why have one obsession when you can have TWO? 

**What it does (so far):**
- ⏱️ Timer with color-coded feedback (red = panic, green = zen master)
- ⚖️ Weight tracking with auto brew ratio calc (because math is hard at 6am)
- 📊 Shot analytics (yes, I chart my caffeine intake like a stock portfolio)
- ☕ Bean management with freshness tracking (RIP to all my stale beans)
- 📝 Tasting notes (90% of mine just say ""needs more coffee"")

**Coming soon™ (aka my weekend coding adventures):**
- 📱 Smart scale integration (because manual input is SO 2024)
- 🤝 Bean sharing with friends (spread those Single Origin recommendations!)
- ☁️ Cloud sync service (your coffee data, everywhere you caffeinate)
- 🔬 Intelligent extraction suggestions (🤖 telling you your shots suck, but politely)

**The ask:** I'm in closed testing and need fellow coffee nerds to break my app! 🔨 Looking for feedback, bug reports, and general ""this is dumb because..."" comments. Fair warning: I respond to feedback with the enthusiasm of a golden retriever who just heard the word ""walk.""

DM me if you want to help a dad turn his caffeine addiction into a slightly more organized caffeine addiction! 

**Disclaimer:** App may cause increased coffee snobbery, spontaneous grinder upgrades, and the uncontrollable urge to lecture people about extraction theory. Side effects include better espresso and emptier wallets. 💸

*P.S. - Yes, I know there are other timer apps. But did THEY let me procrastinate on real work for 2 weeks straight? I think not!* 😤
