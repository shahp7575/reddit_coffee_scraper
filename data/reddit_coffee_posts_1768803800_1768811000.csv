The sex just isn’t what I want and they aren’t into the same things I want to try. I’ve always watched porn and subs here but never tried to post to find someone local until maybe few years back but it was very on and off. 

Now that we are closer to the age for marriage, I’m thinking if this is the right person still. I think they are great in many ways but there are things sexually just not nearly enough for what I want. For example, no nudes and no desire to capture and share our sex life anonymously but I’m not sure if I can easily find someone that’s ok with that either. The sex is also very vanilla and they won’t wear lingerie for me and they just aren’t horny enough. I had hooked up with girls before that would use toys and ask for sex but she’s just nothing like that. 

I guess we are mostly comfortable with each other and somehow managed to be together still for so long. It is scary to move in either direction so I’m at a loss. For context we don’t live together which is why the sex isn’t as available as I wanted but even if we were I’m not sure if I’d be satisfied. 

I’ve accepted the fact that it’s basically impossible for me to find another girl that wants to fuck me as an average guy and even less so if I tell them I’m cheating. Plus I just have too much to lose if they find out so nothing really happened there other than 1-2 coffee chats with ppl I met online. 

I know this is bad and it’s on and off. I want to stop but once I’m horny I would make a post and it became a habit where I’m posting daily just to get messages very rarely. I’m sure I’m an asshole and I never understood why ppl cheat until now. It feels like a dead bedroom yet it’s not. I’ve talked to them and they are trying and improving but maybe it isn’t what I’m looking for still so I’m not sure if I should break up based on that. It’s just really sad for what we have built and been through and I’m most likely cooked af going back on the market these days. 

Feel free to yell at me and tell me how of a person I am. 

Tl;dr: 6 year relationship where for the last 2 years I was constantly looking to cheat online but with no success. Is it too late to turn back or should I just find someone new. ",1,1768810836.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

I’ve been wanting to build a consistent weekend running habit and thought it might be easier (and more fun) with a small group.

Not a “serious” run club—just a few people meeting once a week, easy pace, beginner-friendly (run/walk totally fine).

Plan (tentative):

• Weekend mornings

• 3–5 km, chill pace

• No pressure, no competition

• Chai/coffee after if people are up for it

Starting super small—even 2–3 people is enough.

1qgyiv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qgyiv1/i_work_at_a_dinner_in_the_middle_of_nowhere_part4/,I work at a dinner in the middle of nowhere (part4),"Sorry its been so long, my internet has been on the fritz for the last week and a half, and Mrs. Marlene had me working night shift. “You need to be ready for anything.” Anyway, to make up for it heres two stories to catch you up with everything fun that's been going on at the diner. 

It was a night shift, slow enough that time felt padded. Rain had been coming down for hours, steady but quiet, soaking into the parking lot instead of flooding the pavement. The A is still flickering, and it reflected off the wet asphalt in broken pieces.

Around nine, a woman came in.

She didn’t look lost. That’s what stood out first. Most people who stop here have that tight, irritated look; she didn’t have that. She looked relieved. Not happy. Just relieved.

She picked a booth near the window and sat down.

I brought her a menu, and she thanked me by name.

I hadn’t introduced myself.

And for context, I don’t wear a name tag. I used to, but one of the gnomes had it one morning, and I decided he needed it more than I did.

I opened my mouth to correct her for some reason, then closed it. There are moments at the diner where pushing back feels like leaning into a strong wind. You can do it, but something always happens.

I went to fetch her some water, but when I returned, she hadn't touched the menu, instead she was talking to herself… well, her reflection, and I swear I could almost hear it answer.



She lifted her hand slowly, like she was testing the air. Her reflection copied her, but not perfectly. The timing was off, just a fraction of a second too slow.

She frowned.

“Do you ever notice,” she asked, “that they don’t always keep up when it’s dark out?”

I asked her who she meant.

She laughed like that was a silly question; it sounded like the tinkling of glass windchimes. “Reflections,” she said.

I set the water down with a smile. The surface rippled, and for a second, the reflection in the glass looked clearer than the woman herself.

“I think they get tired,” she said. “All that copying.”

She finally glanced at the menu, then laughed softly. “Oh. Right. I should order something.”

After a moment, she declared, “I simply must have the pie.”

When I brought the plate over, the woman’s reflection was already eating. It had a bit of apple filling on its cheek.

The woman herself hadn’t touched the pie yet.

She noticed me staring and gently slid the plate closer to herself. When she picked up the fork, the reflection paused, then mirrored her again, a little sloppier this time.

Halfway through the slice, she stopped.

“That’s better,” she said. “You mustn't be impatient, it's not ladylike.”

Unfortunately, nothing more eventful happened, but I have noticed that sometimes when it's late, out of the corner of my eye i swear I can see my reflection following just a fraction behind. Ive taken to setting a cup of coffee next to the mirror in the break room when I know it's going to be a long shift.

\---------

I don’t usually run into anyone from work on my days off. The diner’s too far out for that. If you’re not headed there on purpose, you’re probably not headed there at all, and Mrs. Marlene makes sure someone is always there to take care of customers.

I was at the grocery store in town, the small one with the bad carts and the handwritten sale signs that never seem to come down. I’d already done one lap and was standing in front of the cereal, trying to decide between Fruit Zeros or Admiral Crisp, when I saw a guy at the end of the aisle doing something strange.

He was reading the back of a cereal box.

That part wasn’t strange.

What was strange was how long he’d been doing it. And how still he was. He wasn’t leaning or shifting or scratching his head like people do when they read labels. He held the box at chest height and craned his neck down toward it, like moving his arms was off the table for some reason.

After a while, he turned the box upside down.

Then sideways.

Then he nodded.

Not a little nod, either. A full, satisfied one.

He put it back and took a different box. Same process.

I tried not to stare. I mean, I didn’t try that hard, but he caught me looking anyway. His eyes snapped right to mine, and his face lit up with this intense, relieved expression, like he’d been worried no one would notice him and now everything was okay.

“Hello,” he said.

He waved. Not a normal wave. He was shaking his whole arm at me.

“Hi,” I said.

He took a half step closer, then stopped i was just starting to notice how big his eyes were when he spoke.

“This is a good place to acquire sustenance, correct?”

I glanced around the aisle. Cereal. A crooked shelf. A kid a few aisles over crashing carts into things. “I mean… yeah. It’s fine.”

He nodded. Again with the nodding. “This adheres to what I was told.”

There was a pause. A long one. He didn’t seem bothered by it at all. I was very aware that I was still holding a box of cereal, the same kind that he was now holding.

“I am off of the work today,” he added. “I was instructed to,” he held the cereal box out toward me. It was upside down. “obtain sustenance.”

“Okay,” I said. “Good luck with that.”

He frowned, just slightly, like his face was buffering, then smiled again. “Yes. The thanking you.”

I left him there and finished my shopping, but I kept running into him. Produce. Frozen foods. The bread aisle. Every time, he was standing too straight, staring at something, like is it really the first time you have seen a strawberry?

His basket filled up with a strange combination. Five cans of lima beans, one lime, three loaves of bread, and a single open can of cat food. Everything was arranged carefully, labels facing up.

At one point, I heard him quietly saying something under his breath. I couldn’t make out words. It sounded more like counting, but not numbers I recognized.

At the register, he placed each item on the belt one at a time, spacing them out like he didn’t want them to touch. When it was time to pay, he hesitated.

“Is it acceptable,” he asked the cashier, “to exchange this for nourishment?”

He held out what I can only describe as an old tube sock filled with coins.

The cashier blinked. Just once.

I physically saw the light leave their eyes.

They took the sock and started counting. It took a while. Nobody complained. Nobody said anything. We all just waited like this was a thing that happened sometimes.

When he was done, he turned to me again.

“I believe I am doing well,” he said.

“Sure,” I said. “You’re doing great.”

That seemed to make him very happy. He stood a little straighter.

The next day, Marlene pulled me aside at the start of my shift.

“We’re getting help,” she said. “Try not to scare him off.”

Before I could ask anything, the door opened.

Same jacket. Same careful posture. This time, though, he was smiling a little too hard, like he’d practiced it somewhere. That’s when I noticed his teeth were too small, like he’d never lost his baby teeth.

“This is where I work now,” he announced.

Marlene nodded. “This is Eli.”

He looked at me, eyes bright.

“We’ve met,” he said. “Inside of the sustenance acquisition building.”

I watched him walk into the kitchen. He stopped just inside. When he picked up the spatula, he turned it in his hands, inspecting both sides.

Marlene leaned close to me.

“He’s new,” she said. “Be patient.”

“Does he know the rules?” I asked.

Marlene smiled, thin and tired.

“He’ll learn,” she said. “Besides, you’re going to be looking after him.”

Eli turned toward us.

“I am doing the cooking,” he said, lifting the spatula like it was a prize he’d won.

The grill hissed.

The ice machine spat out a few cubes onto the ground.

So if I’m slow getting these next few posts out, blame Eli.

These next few weeks are going to be very long. Wish me luck.

I wanted to share a quick story and see if any other founders here are feeling the same pain.

While scaling my previous projects, I found myself stuck in a ""Hiring Hell."" I’d post a remote job, get 300+ applicants, and spend the entire week doing 15-minute ""quick intro calls.""

**The reality?** 80% of those candidates weren't a fit within the first 2 minutes of the call (lack of communication skills, wrong vibe, or just didn't match the resume). I was wasting 40 hours a month just to find 5 people worth a real interview.

I looked for tools to automate this, but most Enterprise ATS systems were too clunky and expensive for a lean startup.

So, I built [**https://askruit.com**](https://askruit.com)

**The concept is simple:** Instead of a live call, I send candidates a link to 3-4 specific questions. They record their video answers in their own time. I review them at 2x speed while having my morning coffee.

**What I’ve noticed since using it:**

1. **Time saved:** I’ve cut my initial screening time by about 75%.
2. **Quality:** You see the ""real"" candidate immediately. No more being surprised by bad communication skills in the final round.
3. **Candidate experience:** Surprisingly, high-quality remote candidates actually prefer this. They don't have to quit their current job's meetings to hop on a 15-minute call that might lead nowhere.

I'm currently looking for some honest feedback from this community. If you’re hiring remote talent (Devs, Sales, Ops) and want to stop wasting time on screening calls, I’d love for you to try it out.

**Is anyone else using asynchronous video for hiring?** Or do you still prefer the traditional ""intro call""? I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether this is the future of remote recruitment or if I'm missing something.",1,1768810579.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

1qgyfgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/1qgyfgo/stop_wasting_time_on_these_things_if_you_want/,Stop wasting time on these things if you want views,"If I could go back four months to when I first started making videos, I'd tell myself not to post anything yet. I've been creating content for four months now and I'm finally getting around 16,000 views consistently. But I wasted the first two months doing everything completely wrong. I posted three times a week, bought courses on growth strategies, followed every piece of advice I found online. My views stayed stuck at 450.



I thought maybe my niche was too saturated or I wasn't entertaining enough. That successful people have something I'm missing. I almost deleted my account around month two.



Then I stopped guessing and found what was actually broken. If I could start over today with what I know, I'd hit 16,000 views in three weeks instead of four months. Not because I'd be funnier or more creative. Just because I wouldn't spend two months fixing things that weren't problems.



Here's what I'd tell myself to stop doing.



**Stop rewriting your first sentence**. I changed my opening constantly thinking that's where people were leaving. My first sentence was fine. People stuck around through the first four seconds. They left around second ten when I was still building context instead of giving them the actual content. I wasted five weeks on openings that were already good enough.



**Stop upgrading your recording setup**. I bought a ring light and started using a real camera because I thought my phone videos looked cheap. Spent 165 dollars. My retention dropped hard. The videos that got views were messy ones filmed on my phone with zero planning. My video with 31,000 views was recorded on my phone in a coffee shop with people talking in the background. The upgrades killed my numbers.



**Stop posting at recommended times**. I read that you have to post between 5pm and 8pm for engagement. Posted at 6pm every day for six weeks. Views didn't budge. My best performing video went up at 11am on a Thursday because I couldn't wait and just posted it. Six weeks wasted on timing that meant nothing.



**Stop studying creators with big followings.** I analyzed people with hundreds of thousands of followers and tried to copy their style and transitions. It never worked because they're playing a different game. What keeps loyal fans watching doesn't attract new viewers. I spent two weeks trying to replicate their approach before giving up.



**Stop switching topics constantly**. I thought testing different subjects would reveal what my audience wanted. Made productivity content one week, then lifestyle, then tips, then opinion pieces. Views were identical across all topics. The subject wasn't my issue. I was making the same fundamental mistake in every video and changing topics just masked it.



What I'd actually tell myself is find the moment they leave and only fix that moment. Not the hook, not the camera quality, not the posting schedule. Just locate when they're gone and fix what happens there.



It helped a lot to use an app that shows why videos fail. I use one called Tik–Alyzer and it shows the exact second people drop off and tells you what caused it. Standard analytics just show 41 percent retention which doesn't tell you anything useful. This shows people left at second nine because you had a 1.5 second pause or your visual stayed the same for eight seconds. I could have saved two months if I'd used this from the beginning.



Once I stopped working on hooks and production and started fixing where people actually dropped off, my channel took off. Went from 450 views to 16,000 in less than a month. Same content style, same filming location. I just stopped spending energy on things that didn't move the needle.



If you're new you're probably stuck where I was. Nothing else matters until you know where people leave and what makes them leave there. Fix that before touching anything else. The rest doesn't matter.",2,1768810294.0,SocialMediaMarketing,1,1.0,False

Please help!","I first saw this while checking out channels on my Nana's TV. It's been a few years (happened around 2019-2021), and I've been looking ever since, but found nothing similar.

I'm pretty sure it aired on Circle (https://www.circlecountry.com/), though it'd be very odd for them to air something like that.

Alot of it I can't remember, since I switched to another channel out of fear, thought the main parts I remember are these:

\- In a stop-motion Rankin-Bass-esque style an elderly black male is sitting in a chair, drinking coffee, tea, or possibly hot-chocolate, a few seconds later, a 2D Disney-esque animated mouse runs by, and enters a mouse-hole.

\- A slideshow is several family photos are shown, but everyones faces are disturbingly edited and warped. Everything is in black-and-white.

1qgycxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1qgycxz/personalised_impact_of_alcohol_and_caffeine_on/,Personalised impact of alcohol and caffeine on sleep,"I'm curious - has anyone here calculated their own personal tolerance for alcohol and caffeine and the impact it has on your sleep? 

I know in theory alcohol and caffeine are both bad for sleep and there are rules of thumb like ""no caffeine after 2pm"", but in the real world - where you might want a cup of tea at 4pm, or to have a drink in the evening - it might be useful to know to what extent each has on your sleep. 

If it turned out that you could tolerate 1.5mg/litre blood concentration of caffeine without disrupting your sleep, it would mean your ""last coffee"" might be much later than someone more sensitive. If you knew you sleep well as long as your blood alcohol is below 150mg/100ml then you can decide when your last drink should be.

So - has anyone tried this? You'd need to track your alcohol and caffeine consumption, calculate/estimate your blood concentration level at bedtime and then analyse the relationship of these variables with your sleep. 

Is it something you're interested in? Or have you just worked out your tolerance through trial and error and are happy with the knowledge you have?",1,1768810028.0,whoop,0,1.0,False

​(You’re standing in the middle of the shop floor, leaning against a stack of filter boxes. You’ve got that Jack Burton smirk—the look of a man who’s seen things no one would believe, but who still has to get his truck back by midnight. You take a slow sip of coffee, look at the crew, and start talking.)
​""I’m gonna tell you the same thing I told the last guy who asked me about my 'Conversion Rate.' Like I always say, I never drive faster than I can see. Besides that, it’s all in the reflexes.
​Now, listen up, because I’m only gonna say this once. We’re living in a world that’s gone a little soft in the head. We’ve got the 'Nexstar' gurus telling us how to 'orchestrate the customer experience' and the Joe Caccara 'Pure Motive' disciples trying to 'unlock our inner champions.' They want us to walk into a house and treat a broken furnace like a 'Strategic Revenue Event.'
​But I look around this room and I don’t see 'Top Producers.' I see guys who know what a burnt contactor smells like at three in the morning. And that’s where the Mental Divergence comes in.
​In 12 Monkeys, they’d tell you that if you aren't following the script, you’re 'divergent.' You’re 'maladjusted.' Well, I say, let’s get a little maladjusted. Let’s get real weird with it.
​Across this great country, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, there are techs who are so 'sane' they’ve forgotten how to use a multimeter. They’re so busy 'Building Value' and 'Managing Objections' that they couldn't find a grounded compressor if it bit 'em on the seat of their pants. They follow the 'System' until they’re just robots in cargo pants.
​But us? We’ve got that divergence. When we’re in a crawlspace, we aren't 'Leveraging Synergies.' We’re in the trenches. We see the stuff the 'sane' world isn't ready for—the hacked-in ductwork, the ghosts in the low voltage, the ancient boilers that look like something Lo Pan would use to sacrifice a green-eyed girl.
​The corporate suits want you to think your 'Average Ticket' is your soul. That’s just 'Pillar of Growth' talk for 'give us your money.' I say, to hell with that.
​Being 'divergent' means you’ve got the diagnostic integrity to see the machine for what it is. You don't see a 'Sales Lead.' You see a problem that needs a man with a wrench and a brain that doesn't fit in a corporate box. You’re the 'glitch' that actually makes the air cold.
​So, when the 'Sell, Sell, Sell' pressure starts coming down like a 100-year storm, just remember what old Jack Burton does when the earth quakes and the poison arrows fall from the sky. You look that 'Pure Motivational System' right in the eye and you say, 'Give me your best shot, pal. I can take it.'
​We’re the divergent ones. We’re the ones who keep the lights on and the blowers spinning in America. Now, let’s go out there, shake the pillars of heaven, and maybe—just maybe—actually fix a damn TXV.""",0,1768810022.0,HVAC,0,0.4,False

I've ""leveled up"" & started somewhat mirroring his style of texting. By that, logistic heavy...a ton of ""indeeds"", some calendar invites...

I'm also encouraging his workaholism in a way that makes him feel like his ""sacrifices are being seen"" but framing it from a perspective of how I know better now.

Example:

He'd been working from a coffee shop & promised he'd soon be done, ready to join child and I. 

Me: "" Oh love, you are too thoughtful, but don't worry about us. You have so much on your plate. Please don't feel any pressure to rush."" (something like that)

He agreed with a ""heart"" and the infamous ""Indeed"" followed by ""Love you."" I took this ""in"" re affection to state how from here onwards it is *imperative* I ""ensure"" he does what it takes to power through, even if it means burning the midnight oil.

That I support him. Unequivocally.

Then I mentioned whether his back was still sore or if I imagined him saying that (he never said it).

He said that it actually did feel sore due to x,y, z so I insisted he go for a massage. ""Self care matters. You take care of everyone but yourself. I support your working hard, but you MUST also make time for yourself. Your health is vital to us.""

He agreed.

One hour later, I got a text stating he ""loved this new me""

Loved me so much that I barely had to see him till much later & even then minimal interaction... So we both won in a way?

I continue to remain cautiously optimistic.

Julia pinched the bridge of her nose with her fingers and sighed. “Ok, fine. Dad was right. I was hoping I could do better, appeal to your love of challenge or sense of duty or whatever. I knew I couldn’t appeal with money; I know you purchased that game system out of what you consider petty cash. 

“So, I will play dirty.” Jake gave her some hard side eye and grimaced, but didn’t interrupt. “They found video games. One of the societies that found their Cache early was from the section of the galaxy that uploads to our cache. They basically put their entire internet onto quantum bit storage that no one has figured out how to access very well yet, but there is enough information there that the entire League could never decode it all. A lot of it is mundanities, things only historians and archeologists are going to care about, but some of it is… video games. 

“I know you have been getting into alien video games a lot, imagine…” 

He flashed her a look of fury, turned away from her, shook his head, then turned back. “Ok, you are right, you are playing dirty. I suppose that they have no intention of pulling the games out if I’m not there?” 

She handed him a data crystal. “This is what they pulled in the way of games before they decoded them and figured out what they were. Katja said it looked like the earliest video games Humanity ever made, just the sort of thing you seem to like so much. 

“The thing is, they are having a terrible time pulling data out of the thing. No, that isn’t right. They are having a terrible time *controlling* what comes out of the thing. They – so far – have only been able to essentially turn it on and let it spew forth data as fast as they can record it, then they translate and ship it off.” 

“So, they want me to come in and figure out how the thing actually ticks and…” He sighed again, shook his head, and popped the crystal into a slot. She sat as he rushed through some windows and a bunch of blobs began to move on the screen. A small smile formed on Jake’s face as he played the game a few minutes, then he turned it off and moved to face her again. 

“Yes, Julia, playing dirty indeed, and totally unfair; you get my back up trying to push me, then dangle the perfect challenge in front of me along with a promise of…” He shook his head again. “Unfair, completely and utterly unfair. I'm proud of you, well done. I guess I was being unreasonable. Tell Katja I will…” 

She stood, still feeling a little annoyed at the side of him she’d just seen. “Tell her yourself, Uncle Jake. I’m sure you have plenty you need to wrap up here and it isn’t like the computers are going anywhere. So, let her know when you get the chance. Just make sure you come by and say farewell before you go.” 

He nodded to her, a somewhat apologetic look on his face. *I knew who he was, and who he is and isn’t. Not all of us are motivated the same way, and he is still a good man. I’ll get over it, he knows it, but he also knows any apology now would feel hollow.*

*Still, he is going. I probably could have gotten him out there in time anyway, but at least this way it was fairly easy.* 

\*\*\* 

Julia stifled a yawn as she walked into Uncle Kaz’s living room at, well, far too early in the morning. She took the offered cup of coffee – her third already – from Aunt Golna with a grateful nod and noted that at her Aunts and Uncle Kaz didn’t look any more chipper than she did. *We all had functions to go to last night, and Katja knows this.* 

Uncle Kaz spoke almost as if reading her mind. “Whatever Katja has for us had better be good. So help me if she is rousting us out of bed to just to let us know that Jake arrived, I’m going to give her some choice words. No, scratch that. I’m going to call Jake and have *him* give her some choice words.” 

Aunt Yoro smacked him on the shoulder. “That is vicious, even for you, dear. I am sure Katja has a good reason for this.” Her eyes narrowed a bit. “She better.” 

Aunt Golna, who looked less haggard than the rest of them, but she seemed to have that knack, just shook her head and spoke. “In the mean time, I heard something about a bit of excitement about what one of the Bitha groups deciphered yesterday from some Cache data. I know they insisted on sending it to The Confederation first, which means it isn’t weapons information…” She trailed off and raised a single eyebrow at Julia 

*Well, at least it is good news I get to impart this time. Or, well, at least interesting and not bad news.* Julia smiled, savored a pull from her mug, and nodded. “Interestingly, the data didn’t come from The Cache this time; it came from The Archive. Jake has already been at The Cache for a few days, and one of the first things he did – after roundly cussing at or about every technical person who has ever set foot on The Cache, is to compare the meta-data analysis from The Cache to that of The Archive.” She gave them a devilsh smile and took another drink. “You see…” She couldn’t tell where the piece of paper came from, but she took it on the forehead with good grace and a small laugh. “Suffice it to say he didn’t like what he found. We already knew that a lot of data gets carried – unexamined – from Cache to Archive by each cycle. What we suspected, but didn’t have proof of until Jake finished his wizardry, was that not all cycles are as diligent about carrying everything as we are. Many just don’t have the time. Others will prioritize information about the Old Machines that they decoded and everything they couldn’t, but won’t transfer anything they feel is unimportant to future war efforts. 

“So, he had The Archive start pulling data that we don’t have and spreading it around. A lot of what they are finding is information from our little sliver of the Galaxy from the last time that this sector had sapient life, and the one two before that. Well, we think that is where the data is from. It gets a little hard to tell sometimes. Anyway, what they found is that Earth had a sapient species two galactic cycles ago. The species seems to have evolved from a horse-like creature, if you can believe that. Still walked upright, didn’t have hooves or anything, but had apparently kept their penchant for running. 

“There is a little detail on Earth from that time, too. It seems that cycle found their Cache with over sixty years to spare, and put a lot of history into The Archive. Best we can tell, Earth was only about a class 7 world then. Oceans may have been brackish, rather than Saltwater. Pretty fascinating stuff, if I do say so myself. They already have the translators fully loaded, and some of their shorter entertainment recordings.” 

The room’s secure comms channel beeped. Her audience gave her clear indications that they wanted to hear more, then they all turned to the holo display as Kaz hit a button and Katja seemed to float over the coffee table. 

She gave them all a wide smile, but Julia could see the dark circles under her eyes. *It is early morning there too, isn’t it? She keeps them on Council Standard time. By the looks of her, she isn’t just tired, she is missing a fair bit of sleep and doesn’t care if we know it.*

Katja’s smile softened, then turned into something of a wry grin. “I see that none of you are doing much better with the early morning than I am, but that you got more sleep than I did,  at least. Still, it is good to see all of you, and I wish we had time for some social niceties, but I’m afraid we don’t.”

Uncle Kaz nodded, but Golna spoke. “You now have me quite concerned, my friend. I already wondered, and feared, what you could have possibly have found in a thousands of years old pile of data which could be time-sensitive enough to roust us from bed so early. Now, seeing that whatever it is must have had you up at least half the night makes me positively alarmed.”

Katja nodded. “I’m afraid your feelings may be justified, though I don’t think we are really at cause for alarm, at least not yet.” Julia caught herself shifting impatiently, and noticed the same from others. Kaja sighed and shook her head in apology. “I am tired, and my mind is running rabbit trails. 

“We have a problem. It starts with those researchers who went rogue, stole a ship, and set off to parts unknown a little while ago. They are back.” 

She let her words hang in the air, and her eyes unfocused a bit. Just before Julia felt the need to try and give her a gentle prod, her focus snapped back. “Sorry, we had just run into a particularly difficult technical issue and I was already short of sleep when they showed up on the sensors. I’m… not in top form. 

“So, no, the problem that I am hauling you all out of bed for so early is not just that they are back, it is that they were right in that we would have stopped them if we’d found out their plan, and probably would have sent a small armada. Or, just as likely, buried their information and refused to let anyone go at all. We also…”

Silence held for a moment as Katja’s eyebrows drew down, and she turned to look at Julia. *I don’t like something in that gaze.* “There is a reason that I asked you to hold this meeting in Kaz’s private quarters. This is not an official call.” Julia considered getting up and walking out of the meeting, but Aunt Yoro gently moved a foot to cover hers as Katja continued. “I know, Julia, you are very adamant about the ‘Government Under The Sun’ principles, and this time there is a reason. Just hear me out, I promise to let you go before you hear anything that would *require* reporting if you don’t agree.”

*I don’t like this, but… Katja wouldn’t ask something like this without good reason.* She gave a small nod, but set her mouth in a hard line. 

Katja gave a curt nod in response and continued. “The reason that this needs to be unofficial is because those men brought back a serious problem, and it is one that needs to be handled by The League – by which I mean mostly the lot of you and people you can trust – and must be kept secret. Secret to the point that I considered coming there personally to report, but it is too time sensitive; hence the early-morning call. This is something that could blow this entire war wide open, maybe even cause it to start early.” 

Julia sat bolt upright in her chair. Yoro did the same. Golna and Uncle Kaz looked at them with some concern, Katja just gave them a grim look. 

A look of realization dawned on Aunt Yoro's face and she blurted it out. “They brought back isolated Old Machine nanites!”

1qgy7r2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creative_advertising/comments/1qgy7r2/is_this_a_viable_offline_advertising_channel_for/,Is this a viable offline advertising channel for larger brands?,"Hey everyone - I’m doing some early-stage market research on a new offline advertising concept and I’d love honest, critical feedback from people who work in marketing, brand, growth, or media buying.

**The idea:**

Instead of just billboards, posters, or bus ads, brands can sponsor **to-go coffee cups**.  
A company buys blocks of branded cups, and those cups get distributed for free to consumers in the area selected by the brand.

So if a brand wants to target commuters in Manchester, London, Leeds, etc., their branding and message/CTA appears on thousands of takeaway cups in those areas.

The thinking is that this channel is:  
• Offline and real-world (like billboards, OOH, transit ads)  
• Hyper-targeted by location  
• High frequency (people carry the cup around)  
• High goodwill (people associate it with something positive - coffee)

**I’m** ***not*** **selling anything here** \- just genuinely trying to understand if this is:  
A) A serious marketing channel  
B) A gimmick  
C) Something brands would only test at a small scale

My questions:

👉 If you work with brands or in marketing:  
• Would this be something you’d consider testing?  
• What would make it feel legit vs gimmicky?  
• How would you measure success?  
• What kind of brand or campaign do you think this fits best?

👉 If you’ve bought offline ads before:  
• Would this sit alongside billboards / transit / posters - or not really?  
• What budget range would make sense for something like this to try?

I’m especially interested in hearing from:  
• Media buyers  
• Brand managers  
• Growth marketers  
• Anyone who’s run OOH / offline campaigns

Brutal honesty is welcome. If it’s bad, tell me why. If it’s interesting, tell me what would need to be true for it to actually work.

1qgy34b,https://scitechdaily.com/you-dont-have-just-five-senses-new-research-suggests-humans-may-have-up-to-33/,You Don’t Have Just Five Senses🌀 – New Research Suggests Humans May Have up to 33 (6 min read) | SciTechDaily: Science [Jan 2026],"*> We often think of perception as limited to the five traditional senses, yet modern neuroscience suggests the human body may rely on dozens of interconnected sensory systems. These senses work together continuously, shaping how we experience texture, flavor, balance, and even our sense of self.*

**Human perception is multisensory, with dozens of interacting senses shaping how we experience taste, movement, balance, and the world around us.**

*Neuroscientists increasingly treat perception as a distributed system, where multiple sensory channels continuously negotiate a single, coherent reality. Because those channels interact, changing one input, sound, smell, motion, can quietly reshape what you think you’re feeling or tasting.*

Spending hours focused on screens can make us forget about senses beyond sight and sound, even though they never switch off. When we pay attention, we notice the contrast between rough and smooth surfaces, tension building in our shoulders, or the softness of a piece of bread in our hands.

Daily routines are filled with these quiet signals. In the morning, there is the sharp tingle of toothpaste, the sound and pressure of water in the shower, the scent of shampoo, and later the familiar smell of freshly brewed coffee.

Aristotle famously described [five senses](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2184311), but he also believed the world was made [of five elements](https://www.cabinet.ox.ac.uk/fifth-element-and-medieval-cosmology-2), an idea we no longer accept. In the same way, modern science now suggests that human perception relies on far more than just five senses.

# Our experience is deeply multisensory

Much of what we experience [is deeply multisensory](https://theconversation.com/topics/senses-1914). Seeing, hearing, smelling, and touching do not happen in isolation. Instead, they unfold together, blending into a single, continuous awareness of both the world around us and our own bodies.

What we feel affects [what we see](https://doi.org/10.1163/22134808-bja10003), and what we see affects [what we hear](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00725). Different odors in shampoo [can affect how you](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950329309000202) perceive the texture of hair. The fragrance of roses makes hair seem silkier, for instance.

Odors in low-fat yogurts can make them feel richer and thicker on the palate without adding more emulsifiers. Perception of odors [in the mouth](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394006010020), rising to the nasal passage, are modified by the viscosity of the liquids we consume.

# Humans have many more senses than assumed

My long-term collaborator, professor Charles Spence from the Crossmodal Laboratory in Oxford, told me his neuroscience colleagues [believe there are](https://www.sciculture.ac.uk/files/2014/07/AHRC-Rethinking-the-Senses-Case-Study.pdf)anywhere between 22 and [33 senses](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/cspe/projects/rethinking-the-senses/).

These include [proprioception](https://www.britannica.com/science/proprioception), which enables us to know where our limbs are without looking at them. Our sense of balance draws on the [vestibular system](https://www.britannica.com/science/ear/The-physiology-of-balance-vestibular-function)of ear canals as well as sight and proprioception.

Another example is interoception, by which we sense changes in our own bodies such as a slight increase in our heart rate and hunger. We also have a sense of agency when moving our limbs: a feeling that can go missing [in stroke patients](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2017.14)who sometimes even believe someone else is moving their arm.

There is the [sense of ownership](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/147/2/390/7319594). Stroke patients sometimes feel their, for instance, arm is not their own even though they may still feel sensations in it.

# Taste, smell, touch, and balance intertwine

Some of the traditional senses are combinations of several senses. Touch, for instance involves pain, temperature, itch, and tactile sensations. When [we taste something](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7403_supp/full/486S6a.html), we are actually experiencing a combination of three senses: touch, smell, and taste – or gustation – which combine to produce the flavors we perceive in food and drinks.

Gustation, covers sensations produced by receptors on the tongue that enable us to detect salt, sweet, sour, bitter and umami (savory). What about mint, mango, melon, strawberry, and raspberry?

We don’t have raspberry receptors on the tongue, nor is raspberry flavor some combination of sweet, sour, and bitter. There is no taste arithmetic for fruit flavors.

We perceive them through the [combined workings](https://theconversation.com/smell-triggers-the-same-brain-response-as-taste-does-even-if-you-havent-eaten-anything-264922) of the tongue and the nose. [It is smell](https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11121686) that contributes the lion’s share to what we call tasting.

This is not inhaling odors from the environment, though. Odor compounds are released as we chew or sip, traveling from the mouth to the nose through the nasal pharynx at the back of throat.

[Touch plays its part too](https://scholar.archive.org/work/sn5ora556nerbd2gwndzdut5t4), binding tastes and smells together and fixing our preferences for runny or firm eggs, and the velvety, luxuriousness gooeyness of chocolate.

Sight is influenced by our vestibular system. When you are on board an aircraft on the ground, look down the cabin. Look again when you are on the climb.

It will “look” to you as though the front of the cabin is higher than you are, although optically, everything is in the same relation to you as it was on the ground. What you “see” is the combined effect of sight and your ear canals telling you that you are tilting backwards.

# Research reveals how senses shape behavior

The senses offer a rich seam of research and philosophers, neuroscientists and psychologists work together at the Centre for the Study of the Senses at the University of London’s School of Advanced Study.

In 2013, the center launched its Rethinking the Senses project, directed by my colleague, the late Professor Sir Colin Blakemore. We discovered how modifying the sound of your own footsteps can make your body feel lighter or heavier.

We learned how audioguides in Tate Britain art museum that address the listener as if the model in a portrait was speaking enable visitors to remember more visual details of the painting. We discovered how aircraft noise interferes with our perception of taste and why you should always drink tomato juice on a plane.

While our perception of salt, sweet, and sour is reduced in the presence of white noise, umami is not, and tomatoes, and tomato juice is [rich in umami](https://doi.org/10.1186/2044-7248-3-2). This means the aircraft’s noise will taste enhance the savory flavor.

# Everyday illusions expose sensory complexity

At our latest interactive exhibition, [Senses Unwrapped](https://www.kingscross.co.uk/event/club-curling) at Coal Drops Yard in London’s King’s Cross, people can discover for themselves how their senses work and why they don’t work as we think they do.

For example, the size-weight illusion is illustrated by a set of small, medium and large curling stones. People can lift each one and decide which is heaviest. The smallest one feels heaviest, but people can them place them on balancing scales and discover that they are all the same weight.

But there are always plenty of things around you to show how intricate your senses are, if you only pause for a moment to take it all in. So next time you walk outside or savor a meal, take a moment to appreciate how your senses are working together to help you feel all the sensations involved.

1. The quality of the coffee beans accounts for 40%;

2. The uniformity of the grind accounts for 30%;

3. The stability of the coffee machine accounts for 20%;

4. The skill of the person making the coffee accounts for 10%.

So，when you have a limited budget, such as $500-$700, my suggestion is not to spend most of the money on the coffee machine.  You should allocate at least half of your budget to a good coffee grinder, and then buy higher-quality coffee beans for everyday use.",4,1768809014.0,espresso,8,0.83,False

I actually have dreams αbout my past life α lot! The living room was somewhat nautical themed. there was blue carpet throughout the house, and α circular coffee table in front of the couch that sticks out to me because it was really pretty. XD

I also remember my old bedroom, this one i remember in the most detail. it was on the top floor of the house and had α sloped roof, α circular window, and all of the walls/ceiling were white painted wood panels. I had α metal daybed, α tall bookshelf and α foldable dollhouse. i also has α circular rug that was shades of muted pink and green. I had αnother window across from my bed with α bench in front of it. the bench had α velvety pink cushion on it and α round pillow. i had heavy looking velvety curtains that matched, and paintings on the walls. I'm pretty sure I had brothers but I unfortunately don't remember them at all. 

I remember an older lady that was α relative of mine but i don't remember anyone else. the house was in the middle of nowhere and I remember there was α big porch that went all the way around. it seemed to be α lot older than the 80s, my guess is it had to be at least α hundred years old. the backyard was big- there was α pond, α bunch of land, α swingset, and we had dogs. the way I know it was the 80s is because of the toys and tv shows. 

When I was younger (the present day me, not my past life) my mother was showing me toy videos from her childhood and I recognized α bunch of them. I had α cabbage patch doll and i recognized it in the video, and that's when i told my mom what i remembered and realized that's probably not normal lol. I also know I died young, not sure what the cause was but I know I was younger than 10. I have α lot of very vivid dreams about that time as well.

okay real talk. i used to rehearse basic sentences in my head before speaking. ordering coffee felt like a performance review. saying ""you too"" when the waiter said ""enjoy your meal"" would ruin my entire week.



here's what nobody tells you: that voice in your head screaming ""everyone thinks you're an idiot"" isn't actually YOU. it's evolutionary biology doing its thing. our ancestors needed social acceptance to literally survive. getting kicked out of the tribe = death. so our brains developed this hypervigilant system that treated every social interaction like a life or death situation.



modern society doesn't work that way anymore, but your amygdala didn't get the memo.



the good news? this is completely manageable once you understand what's actually happening in your brain. these are the strategies that genuinely moved the needle for me after reading way too many books and research papers on social psychology.



1. understand the spotlight effect is lying to you



cornell researchers did this study where they had students wear embarrassing tshirts, then asked them to estimate how many people noticed. students guessed around 50%. actual number? less than 25%.



your brain massively overestimates how much attention people pay to you. everyone's too busy worrying about their own shit. that ""awkward thing"" you said three days ago that keeps you up at night? the other person forgot it 30 seconds later.



i started testing this deliberately. said something weird in a meeting, then asked a colleague about it a week later. they had literally zero memory of it.



2. reframe judgment as data collection, not rejection



this mindset shift from the book ""the confidence gap"" by russ harris (acceptance and commitment therapy expert, translated into 30+ languages) completely changed how i process social feedback. 



the core idea: judgment isn't about YOU, it's about the other person's values, experiences, insecurities. when someone judges your opinion harshly, you're actually learning about THEIR worldview, not getting objective feedback about your worth.



started viewing conversations as experiments. ""what happens if i share this opinion?"" not ""will they think i'm stupid for saying this?"" removes the emotional charge entirely.



3. practice strategic vulnerability



counterintuitive but backed by brené brown's research (her ted talk has 60million+ views for a reason). sharing imperfections actually makes people like you MORE, not less. 



the psychology term is ""pratfall effect"". competent people who make small mistakes are rated as more likeable than those who appear perfect.



i started deliberately sharing small ""failures"" in conversations. ""totally botched that presentation yesterday"" or ""i have no idea what i'm doing with this project honestly"". the response? people opened up back. conversations got way more real.



4. separate self worth from communication performance



this was the hardest one. i used to think every sentence i spoke was a referendum on my intelligence and value as a human.



here's the reality check from cognitive behavioral therapy principles: you are not your thoughts. you are not your words. you are not any single moment of social interaction.



started using this mental separation technique. when i'd say something awkward, instead of ""i'm so stupid,"" i'd think ""that sentence didn't land well, let me try a different approach."" treating communication as a SKILL you're developing, not a measurement of your inherent worth.



5. exposure therapy but make it systematic



every therapist will tell you this, but the execution matters. you can't just ""put yourself out there"" randomly and hope for the best.



i used the app finch to track daily social exposures. started absurdly small. week 1: make eye contact with cashier. week 2: add one sentence of small talk. week 4: share an opinion in a group chat.



BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns expert knowledge into personalized audio podcasts tailored to your goals. Built by Columbia University alumni and AI experts from Google, it pulls from high-quality sources like research papers, books, and expert interviews to create content that fits your schedule and learning style.



What makes it useful for social anxiety is the hyper-personalized learning plan. You can tell the app about your specific struggles with social situations, and it builds an adaptive roadmap based on your needs. The content goes beyond surface-level advice, offering everything from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and practical strategies. You can also customize the voice, choosing between energetic tones when you need motivation or calming ones for evening learning. Worth checking out if you want structured guidance that evolves with your progress.



the progress was so gradual my anxiety didn't have time to spiral. six months later i was volunteering to present at team meetings.



the key is consistency over intensity. one small uncomfortable social interaction daily beats one massive panic inducing situation monthly.



6. learn to sit with discomfort without reacting



insight timer has this meditation series on ""being with difficult emotions"" that honestly taught me more than therapy did about managing social anxiety.



the instinct when you feel judged is to either fight back defensively, retreat completely, or ruminate for days. none of these help.



instead: notice the feeling. name it. ""i'm feeling shame right now."" ""my chest is tight, that's anxiety."" don't try to make it go away. just observe it like you're a scientist studying an interesting phenomenon.



sounds like hippie nonsense but there's solid neuroscience behind this. the act of labeling emotions reduces amygdala activation. you're literally calming your threat response system.



7. recognize that some judgment is actually useful



not all feedback is invalid just because it makes you uncomfortable. this distinction matters.



constructive criticism from someone invested in your growth? worth considering. random person on the internet saying you're annoying? ignore completely.



the book ""thanks for the feedback"" by douglas stone breaks down how to separate signal from noise. best framework i've found for processing social feedback without spiraling.



8. build competence in what you're speaking about



real confidence comes from genuine knowledge. when you actually know your shit, the fear of judgment decreases naturally because you're not secretly worried they'll expose you as a fraud.



i spent six months deeply learning my field. read the foundational papers, listened to expert podcasts, took courses. eventually realized i DID have valuable insights worth sharing.



this isn't about becoming perfect before you speak. it's about building enough foundation that your internal critic has less ammunition.



9. find your people



some environments are genuinely toxic and will judge you no matter what you say. that's not your problem to fix.



i left a friend group where every conversation felt like navigating a minefield. found people who actually appreciated my communication style, weird tangents and all.



you're not going to vibe with everyone. that's fine. spend time with the people who make speaking feel easy.



10. remember that everyone feels this way sometimes



even the most confident seeming people have moments of social anxiety. i interviewed several ""naturally charismatic"" colleagues and literally all of them admitted to rehearsing conversations or worrying about judgment.



the difference isn't that they don't feel fear. they've just learned not to let it stop them from speaking.



look, changing deep social anxiety patterns takes time. your brain's been practicing this fear response for years, you're not going to rewire it in a week. but every single conversation where you speak despite the fear, you're building new neural pathways.



the goal isn't to never feel judgment. it's to feel it and speak anyway. because your thoughts, perspectives, and voice deserve to exist in the world, regardless of how your nervous system feels about it in the moment.",1,1768808432.0,rSocialskillsAscend,0,1.0,False

First off: this isn’t meant to be a partisan critique, and it’s not a demand to “pick a side.” It’s a critique of method as implemented. In theory I ofc see where Coffeezilla is coming from even though as a Canadian, you can probably imagine where my own biases would lead me on the issue

In the latest [Epstein video](https://youtu.be/wxszxvwOhtY?si=HCuSHz7UGL-xznPx), the breakdown leans toward the idea that “the government” is protecting a class of powerful people. Maybe the idea that enforcement has simply collapsed into elite self-protection. That explanation *feels* neutral, but it also makes the outcome seem arbitrary and unknowable, as if no further analysis is possible beyond cynicism.

In other contexts, especially fraud, coffee's analysis is always sharper. When behaviour repeats under pressure, it’s treated as a signal. Delays matter. Half-compliance matters. Redefined rules matter. The question isn’t “why is said scammer responding now?,” but “what behaviour does this system reliably produce once the costs and risks are clear?” That’s how predictable outcomes stop looking shocking.

That same logic applies here.

The DOJ missing deadlines, redefining compliance, and testing enforcement boundaries isn’t mysterious if you look at the structure around enforcement. Oversight, subpoenas, and contempt don’t execute themselves. They depend on sustained political will. As Congress becomes more polarized, enforcing transparency against politically sensitive targets becomes riskier, not easier. Under those conditions, delay and reinterpretation aren’t aberrations; they’re the rational response.

This is why apolitical framing underperforms. By treating institutions as timeless actors ('08 DOJ ≠ '16 DOJ ≠ '26 DOJ) and collapsing all incentives into “elite protection,” it removes the variables that explain *why* obstruction happens now, *how* it happens, and *why it keeps repeating*. The result is an analysis that describes frustration accurately but explains outcomes poorly.

You can see the contrast clearly when looking at corruption elsewhere. When incentives, signals, and repeat behaviour are centered, outcomes stop looking random. In fact, in Coffee's latest upload when he says ""it feels like crime is legal for the right person'. Because it is, and in some ways its technically always been. But the reason it feels differnet is because it is different. In the same way that not all scams are the same (or else coffeezilla would've never had to make more than a couple vids covering scams), neither are all the incentives that produce different potentially corrupt outcomes 

So the prescription isn’t to adopt a partisan stance. It’s to stop treating symmetry as a goal in itself, and instead investigate how current partisan incentives shape enforcement, disclosure, and non-compliance even when that analysis produces asymmetric conclusions about who benefits, who stalls, and why.

Though if coffeezilla is uninterested about making the emphasis that the Epstein congress votes are done on a partisan basis, or really any other visually partisan aspects related to the epstein stuff. That's fine too, as an anti trump non american partisan. The coverage itself makes this fat wanna be conqueror look bad & judging from the last two video endings, it seems coffeezilla is actually on the exact same arc I was on when i used to view these two sides as the mostly the same (which in different ways, in less political contexts is still true)",13,1768808313.0,Coffeezilla_gg,1,0.88,False

(My secret for starting vacation early),"Alfonso here. I’m a fellow resident (I live right here in Yorba Linda), and like most of us, I love our ""bubble."" We have the Town Center, the horse trails, and the library... honestly, there’s rarely a reason to leave.

Except when it’s time for that big family vacation.
I was chatting with a neighbor at Bristol Farms the other day who was stressing out about a family cruise to the Mediterranean. They were dreading the drive to LAX, the parking fees, and the chaos of coordinating 10 people.
Here is the local ""hack"" I told them (and why you need a neighbor in the business):

1. The ""SNA"" Slide

Stop defaulting to LAX! As an agent, I see flight routings that online engines bury. There are incredible connections out of John Wayne (SNA) or even Ontario (ONT) which is practically in our backyard against traffic that can get you to London or Rome with just one easy layover. You can be at the airport in 20 minutes from Yorba Linda Blvd instead of fighting the 91 for two hours.

2. The ""Door-to-Door"" Service

When you book online, you’re on your own from your driveway to the ship. When you work with my agency (Expedia Cruises in Norwalk), we can arrange private transfers that pick you up right at your curb in Yorba Linda. No circling for parking, no shuttle buses. Just vacation mode starting the second you lock your front door.

3. I’m Right Down the Road

I own the Expedia Cruises center just down the freeway in Norwalk, but I’m usually working from home here in Yorba Linda or grabbing coffee locally. If you want to talk through a complex itinerary (like a luxury river cruise or a multi gen Disney trip), you don't need to call an 800 number. You’re talking to a guy who deals with the same HOA letters you do. 😂

The Bottom Line:

We live in the ""Land of Gracious Living"" your travel planning should feel gracious, too, not stressful.
If you’re planning something big for 2026, 2027 or as far out as 2028, shoot me a message or wave if you see me around town. Let’s make sure your trip is perfect before you even leave the 92886.",1,1768808302.0,ExpediaCruises,0,1.0,False

I’m struggling so much right now, and none of the ‘tricks’ I see online seem to work for me. I think part of the issue is that I am a stay at home mom and even though my husband does his fair share (if not more, which makes me feel even worse), just the day with my kids is so exhausting. I think I do a pretty good job with them, and I enjoy my time with them, but it’s also so much talking and doing things and multitasking and planning and anxiety about everything every day. 

I don’t want to be judged because ‘I chose to have kids’, I know that’s true and I love my kids and my family more than anything, and I love being a SAHM. But I don’t feel like there is ever an opportunity to relax or de-stress without the looming dread of failure and things that need to be done hanging over my head. My husband gives me lots of opportunities to have alone time but nothing seems to help. I started on an SSRI for OCD recently and it helped a bit so maybe I’m depressed as well as anxious, but the side effects have been tough to deal with so I’m going to come off of it soon. I’m also on vyvanse which helps me at least function during the day. 

A lot of the tips I see for dealing with burnout involve spending money on things - coffee, vacations, nails, etc and those do help me a bit but with only one income they can’t be a go-to for me, and I also think they don’t actually fix anything substantively… So, please share any tips you have to crawl out from this burnout?

Most mornings come with a list.  
This one came with nothing.

This morning, my body asked nothing of me.  
I took that as a chance to write.

I'm awake in my bedroom, still half asleep.  
Everyone else is quiet.  
The house is holding its breath.  
It feels good, like something gentle is about to happen.

The night hasn’t fully let go yet.  
There’s a soft hum in the air, a calm so complete it almost feels planned.

My body is still.  
Not waiting.  
Not bracing.  
Just still.

Nothing is required.  
Nothing needs fixing, doing, or managing.

I let myself pause for a moment.  


**Three Birds, Early**

Outside, the world begins to wake.  
Then I hear it.

Three birds singing.

So early.  
So clear.

I actually stop moving when I hear them.  
The sound lands like good news.

I smile right away.  
Not politely.  
Not cautiously.  
A real smile, the kind that surprises me by showing up on its own.

For a moment, I forget about the day entirely.

I’m not listening for problems.  
I’m not preparing for the day.  
I’m just listening.

A car passes in the distance, heading somewhere important to someone else.  
Above me, something scurries in the attic.  
Squirrels, maybe.  
The ordinary humour of it makes me chuckle softly.

Nothing special is happening.  
I don’t want it to end.

This is how joy sneaks in.  
Through normal things behaving beautifully.

**Where the Mind Wanders**

My hearing drifts, and suddenly I’m somewhere else.

Mornings I’ve known before.  
Open roads.  
Quiet starts.

I close my eyes and let my mind finish the picture.

Rolling Scottish hills.  
Rivers bending slowly through the land.  
Stone chimneys breathing out smoke.  
Sheep scattered like punctuation across the fields.

I don’t expect the feeling, which is why it lingers.

The happiness that comes with it feels immediate and physical.  
Warm.  
Settling right in my chest.

No explanation needed.

**Being Here, Entirely**

I notice my breathing.  
It rises and falls easily, confidently, like it knows what it’s doing.

I take one full breath.  
Then another.

I stay there longer than I usually would.  
I feel fully present.

The warmth of skin on a cold winter morning.  
Hair brushing my cheek.  
The weight of my body resting into the bed.  
The cool sheet against my foot.

Every sensation feels friendly.  
Like my body is on my side.  
Like the moment itself is on my side.

It’s amazing how much goodness is already there, waiting to be noticed.

**Nothing More Than This**

I smell toast.  
Or maybe it’s burnt, so now I imagine eggs and beans and coffee.  
Honestly, that feels just as satisfying.

Imagination counts.  
Joy doesn’t ask how it arrived.

I don’t think about later.  
Later can wait.

The town was small. One main street, a few houses, a couple of shops. Not much to see. I got out of my car and stretched.

At the station, I gave my badge to the cops. They all looked nervous. I grabbed their files and flipped through them fast. Names, dates, notes. She had been missing for seven days now. Didn’t matter much. I stacked them on the counter. I’d deal with them later. Maybe.

I walked around town a bit. Asked a few obvious questions. “Seen her?” “When last?” People gave short answers. Most of them didn’t really look at me. I didn’t care. I didn’t need details right now.

I passed the square. Some kids stared. Some adults, too. I nodded and moved on. Didn’t really think about what they meant. They assumed I would notice things. I didn’t. Not yet.

The files got shuffled around. Misplaced one here, left another in my car. Couldn’t be bothered to fix it. The cops tried to point stuff out. I nodded. Said, “Right, right.” Didn’t follow up. Not really. Too much fuss for little gain.

I stopped at the school. Asked a teacher if anyone saw her. Got a shrug. A “no idea.” I wrote it down fast. Didn’t ask more. I didn’t feel like it. Too much trouble.

I saw small things—door open, footprints in dirt—but I didn’t chase them. Not worth it. Maybe later.

I walked some more. Listened to some. Nodded when people talked. Asked obvious questions. Didn’t follow leads. Didn’t care much. The town could figure itself out. I had my coffee. That was enough.

I went back to the teacher’s house. The door was shut this time. I looked around the yard for a minute, but didn’t bother checking the ground too closely. A few footprints, some disturbed dirt, maybe they were important, maybe not. Didn’t really matter. I walked on.

The student kept trying to talk to me. Kept saying he saw something, that the man was dangerous, that the teacher wasn’t gone by accident. I nodded a lot. “Sure, sure,” I said. “We’ll see.” I didn’t take notes. I didn’t ask questions. He fidgeted, got frustrated, but I didn’t care. Kids get worked up. Always thinking they see things.

At the square, I noticed some things out of place. A window left open. A gate is slightly swinging. Some papers are scattered. I squinted at them for a second, then shrugged. Probably nothing. Probably wind or kids. Not my problem.

I went through the files again. Dates, names, notes scribbled by local cops. Didn’t make much sense to me. I flipped pages fast. Missed the small things. The details didn’t matter. I had enough work just sitting around and pretending I was checking.

The student kept showing me his notebook. Lines, arrows, patterns, he had noticed. He pointed out where the man had been, what time he left his house, and where he followed the teacher. I nodded, said, “Okay, okay.” Didn’t ask for copies. Didn’t check any of it. It was too much work.

I passed by the man’s house again. He was on the porch, sweeping or maybe pretending to. Hard to tell. I looked at him for a few seconds, then moved on. Didn’t follow up. Didn’t peek through the windows. Didn’t check doors. I had better things to do.

The student started getting angry. Kept pacing, muttering under his breath. I ignored it mostly. Kids get excited. Let them talk. Let them fume. Doesn’t change anything.

I went to the square again in the evening. Footprints on the dirt path. I bent over to look, but didn’t take notes. Didn’t measure, didn’t photograph. Probably old. Probably nothing. Didn’t matter. I had my notebook half empty anyway. I scribbled a few words to look busy.

The student kept giving me more info. Times, places, weird things he saw. I nodded, said, “Yeah, yeah.” Didn’t follow up again. Didn’t care. He glared at me like he was going to choke me. But it wasn’t my problem. Not yet.

I knew the kid was worried. Could see it in his face. But I had my methods. My pace. Didn’t need to rush. Didn’t need to chase shadows. Let the town deal with itself. If the teacher didn’t come back, fine. I’d file the report later.

For now, I moved slowly. Talked a little. Pretended I was checking. Ignored patterns, missed footprints, didn’t notice the small things. I was in charge here, technically. But I didn’t need to do much. Someone else could worry.

The student looked more frustrated every time I saw him. Good. Let him worry. He was young. Didn’t know how to relax. Didn’t know how to ignore things that didn’t matter. I did. That was enough.

I walked past the teacher’s house again. The gate squeaked, the wind shifted, and I stopped for a second. Something felt off. Not important. Probably nothing. But I lingered there longer than usual. Just to make sure.

The student was nearby, scribbling in his notebook. He looked up at me. His eyes were sharp, almost accusing. I nodded and said something vague about checking the area. He didn’t look convinced. Didn’t matter. Kids always think adults are hiding something.

I went through the yard, brushing dirt from my shoes. The vegetable patch was neat, some plants bent, some broken. I paused over a section, squatted, and ran my fingers lightly over the soil. Nothing really caught my attention, but I pretended I was inspecting carefully. Maybe I lingered a bit too long. Maybe I glanced too often at spots that didn’t need attention.

The student started muttering under his breath. He looked uneasy. Good. Let him worry. Let him think I knew more than I said. It made my job easier.

Later, I wandered near the square. I lingered near the corner, pretending to read a sign. Checked it, adjusted it, and left. The student was watching, scribbling faster. His eyes kept flicking toward me. I caught him looking, just for a second, and smiled faintly. Didn’t mean anything. But maybe he thought it did.

He kept muttering about the missing teacher, about the man in town, about patterns. I nodded again. Let him talk. Didn’t answer much. But I made small gestures—glances toward her house, a pause by a window he hadn’t noticed. Small, meaningless things, but they made him shift in place. He squinted, tilted his head, looked unsure. Perfect.

I passed by the dirt path near the school. A footprint caught my eye. Bent over, touched it lightly, just to see. Didn’t measure, didn’t note, didn’t care. But the student saw. His eyes widened. He muttered something under his breath, and for a second, I thought he might suspect me. Funny thought. Couldn’t be. I had nothing to do with her disappearance.

I moved slowly, sometimes stopping where I shouldn’t have. Sometimes I touched objects just to see, or leaned on the fence for no reason. It was a habit. It was nothing. But the student kept staring. I caught him glancing behind me, checking if I’d disappear or leave clues.

The tension built in small ways. Small pauses, small glances, small actions that probably meant nothing at all. But the student didn’t know that. He thought I was different. He thought I was connected to something he couldn’t see.

And maybe he was right to wonder. Maybe it looked strange, my timing, my attention to things that didn’t need it. Maybe someone watching could put the pieces together in the wrong way. Maybe the town would start whispering, too.

I shrugged. Didn’t care. I had my coffee. I had my notebook. I had the quiet streets around me. If someone thought I knew more than I did, fine. Let them worry. Let them guess. Let them be afraid of shadows that weren’t mine.

The student’s eyes followed me as I walked away. I smiled faintly again. Nothing to see here. Or maybe everything. Who could tell?

However, in that faint moment, my eyes drifted to the edge of the path, where the neatly lined planters sat undisturbed. Something faint scratched at the back of my mind, drag marks beside it, subtle but out of place. Not enough to make me hurry. I pushed the thought down, told myself it was nothing, but it lingered anyway, just enough to make me think I would circle back later, if only to prove it meant nothing.",1,1768807306.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

It was very rocky, we argued a lot and just never seemed to able to see eye to eye on things. I really wanted things to work out with her, so when she broke up with me after a particularly stressful weekend. I was distraught and tried so hard to get her back. But when I saw nothing was going to pan out, I started focusing on myself. Working out, going out, the likes.

Fast forward a few months later I met my current girlfriend through a mutual friend and we hit the ground running. We’ve been going strong for a little under two years now, I’ve never been happier with someone, we have our ups and downs but for the most part we’re a very compatible and healthy couple in my opinion.

However my gf has always held a lot of disdain for my ex because she believed that she wasn’t over me (when me and her started going out my ex started to become a lot more friendly and shit like that). Now I don’t have any communication with my ex in any capacity. Until the other day I was in a coffee shop when she walked in, she said hi to me and I said hi back. Now I had an AirPod in listening to music so I wasn’t fully paying attention when she said “you smell good” (I was wearing the cologne I often wore when we were together) and I sort of instinctively said thank you, as you do when someone compliments you and that was it.

When I got home I told my gf and she kinda blew up at me, and I was understanding of it so I let her cool down before talking to her about it again. She was still pretty pissed at me for saying thanks to her which I fully understand. But now she’s been bringing her up over and over. She said she was going to address her, and I told her she had my full support if she truly believed it was a problem. Then things will happen like her mom told me I smelt nice. And she went “ugh why is everyone telling you you smell good”. Comments like that. But today I asked her how she slept, and she said she had a dream about my ex, I think this is getting a bit outlandish now, I just wish she’d stop creating a mountain out of a molehill.

1qgxlfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1qgxlfc/coming_to_realize_how_my_upbringing_has/,Coming to realize how my upbringing has permanently affected every aspect of my life.,"I’m 29 years old, and haven’t seen my mother in over 5 years. I’ve had very minimal contact with her as well. 

For awhile I displaced the negative memories and feelings from my upbringing. Lately I’ve been remembering some of the memories & feelings from my youth. I felt bad about not having much contact with her, but the memory recall has been validating for me. 

Her narcissism & cold demeanor has messed me up more than I can even believe. 

One of my first memories is my parents fighting. I was in the backseat of the car in a car seat. My dad got out of the car and walked away on the sidewalk down the street. My mom pulled off. I remember getting home and asking my mom when daddy was coming home. 

After my parents split around 11 years old, I was expected to take on a lot of responsibility. Taking care of the house, tons of chores everyday, being the go to babysitter for my 5 younger siblings whenever her and my stepdad wanted to go somewhere. I always did what was expected of me and never complained. I remember crying a LOT, yearning for the day I’d get the fuck out of there. Feeling guilty for having to eventually leave my brothers behind who also got treated like garbage. Always feeling that I was being a dramatic teenager and my feelings were invalid. This was normal treatment. But it wasn’t. I had three additional siblings whom she had with my stepdad and they were never treated like we were. 

They locked the pantry with a padlock. We weren’t allowed to have food without asking or we’d get in trouble. I was never given a key to any of our houses. I was never allowed it. Neither were my brothers. Over the years I remember having my heart broken because they would adopt a dog or a cat from a shelter or wherever, and then after a couple months rehome them with little to no notice to us. Probably 5 dogs, 4-5 cats. This happened from elementary school through high school. I remember a punishment they used was having us shovel a pile of gravel from the backyard into a wheelbarrow, and move it to the other side of the yard. 

They took my brothers bedroom door off over him reacting to something he was upset about. My stepdad got physical with my brothers. 

My one brother has Asperger’s, and my stepdad was incredibly inpatient, rude, and indifferent toward him and his special needs which disgusted me. 

Her footsteps made my heart race. I’m realizing that I never felt safe in my own home. I never felt truly loved. It was always a manipulation game within my own mind to try and keep her happy and satisfied. Do what she asks. Don’t complain. And that was never enough. I always felt like she was going to be dissatisfied with me and scold me. I remember tiptoeing around my house. Closing cupboards gently. I still do that to this day. There was absolutely no emotional validation or vulnerability. My needs and feelings were never considered. I never felt maternal love and nurturing from her. I’m realizing now, 12 years after being out of her house, how damaging that shit was to me. I’m bad at talking about my feelings. I never felt like I could ask her for anything. My entire childhood. If I wanted to have sleepovers with my friends, their parents would have to pick me up/ drive me home. She’d never drive me to cheerleading practice or go to games or competitions.  

The weekends spent at my Dads were the best. He was so attentive to my brothers and I. I always woke up to breakfast being made and coffee ready for me just the way I liked it. Lunch & dinner the same. He always made sure we were happy. He took us out for hikes & adventures constantly. Took us fishing, kayaking, to movies, always having fun and laughing our asses off the whole weekend. I felt the love. He taught me how to drive, when my mother refused to. Even though she was constantly pestering me about getting my license but never put the effort to help me learn. I remember crying when Sunday came around and we had to leave. I felt safe and relaxed at my Dads. And never felt that at my Moms. 

I got in the habit of staying up all night after she went to bed because that was the only time I could really enjoy my space & relax. I’m artsy so I’d drink coffee all night and draw, listen to music, watch tv. That’s transferred into my adulthood. I realized recently I feel safe after 10/11pm, and that’s when I get the motivation to do the things I want to or like to do. The daytime feels unsafe. 

I feel like I can never rest or relax. Indulge in my hobbies and interests. I feel like there’s always something i have to do that I’m not doing. Mostly cleaning / chores. I can’t stand doing dishes because I’d have to do them twice a day living with her. I’ll put my dishes off for weeks sometimes. I hate that I do that, but i resent them. I’m oversensitive to the energy around me. If I sense my partner is upset I become very small and tiptoe around, trying not to bother him, trying to make my energy as small and unbothered as possible. 

I don’t think I was ever given words of affirmation from her. So I have a VERY hard time accepting compliments from anyone. I have very low self esteem, inside and out. I don’t think I deserve nice gestures from people either. it’s unfamiliar / uncomfortable territory when someone wants to be generous / kind with me. 

 

I’m a huge people pleaser. I’ll do whatever to make someone happy and hopefully be proud / like me better after. I did that a lot with work. Accept extra shifts or tasks when I didn’t want to, with the hope of being accepted / liked / appreciated. 

This has affected my adulthood in irreparable ways. I’ve gotten into many toxic relationships, abusive relationships. Got heavy into drug use as coping mechanisms. My mental health is really bad right now and I feel like I’m stuck. I dont know what to do with my life. I don’t feel good enough. I always feel lesser than around people. My social anxiety / OCD is getting worse. I envy people who have healthy relationships with their parents. Who receive love and support. My Dad who I was close to has moved thousands of miles across the country with his new wife. I want him to be happy. He deserves to travel and start over. But I miss him dearly and wish I could see him. 

I’m extremely codependent in every relationship I have. 

I’m just so tired. 

I’m grateful for these realizations lately, so I can consider therapy to be able to move forward and have a healthy life. Because I’m completely hindered at the moment and I’m unable to have healthy relationships with myself and others. I feel so small and alone. 

I never felt like I could truly be myself around her either, even after moving out. The few years where I’d maintain contact and see her, I always felt like I had a mask on. She’s never gotten to know the real me. I’m not comfortable being 100% myself. Even as an adult I still feel like she’s going to be upset with me and I’m going to be in trouble. This kind of upbringing is so fucked up. 

I’m so sorry for whoever else is dealing with this. Especially currently. All I can say is having no contact has taken some stress away. But it hurts at the same time that she hasn’t initiated any kind of genuine effort to try and repair this.

Could use some advice.,"A couple years ago, my girlfriend and I decided we wanted to keep track of restaurants/coffee shops/bars that we've gone to together. We wanted a list we could both easily access and look at on our phones, so we started off with an iPhone note. We also used it to keep track of places we still wanted to try and for our notes about places we've been. After a while, this got way too unwieldy for an iPhone note, so we realized we needed a new method. 

I really liked the idea of fully tracking our list in either Apple or Google Maps. Both let you write personal notes about places, make custom lists, and Google even lets you collaborate on lists. The problem with both of these apps, though, is that when a restaurant closes, they will sometimes disappear. We don't want the places we've been together on our list to disappear. 

I finally got to a point where I had to admit that the best way to do this would be a spreadsheet. We now have a shared Apple Numbers spreadsheet. It keeps all the info we want, and we know none of our listings will ever vanish. I also maintain an Apple Maps guide for the places we've been and a second guide for places we want to go, just since it's cool to see what's close to us when we travel. 

While that method works, it's kind of a pain in the ass to look at a spreadsheet. Especially on an iPhone. I keep coming back to Beli as an alternative, and it seems so close, but I unless I'm missing something, it seems like there a more a few things that don't work for our idea:

1. Is there not a way to make custom lists? What about shareable lists my girlfriend and I could both look at? I'd even settle for a shared list only one of us can edit but the second person can view. This would be for restaurants we've been to together, but we could each still use the app to rate places we've been individually or with other people.

2. How does this app handle restaurant closures? I'm already seeing a couple that I can't seem to find that only closed recently. This is the biggest issue, because we still went to track restaurants that have closed. 

If those two things aren't going to be possible in this app, is there another you can think of that might work better for us? I hate the idea that the spreadsheet is the best way. ",1,1768806796.0,beliapp,0,1.0,False

I’ve been trying to figure out how to improve my website’s Google visibility lately, and like a lot of people, I typed “[SEO service near me](https://arawebtechnologies.com/seo.php)” hoping for quick results. What I quickly realized is that just finding a nearby agency isn’t enough — there’s a lot more that goes into good SEO than most people think.

A lot of local businesses make the mistake of hiring someone just to “get rankings.” But good SEO is more about long-term strategy than instant results. It includes fixing technical issues on your site, optimizing content, building relevant backlinks, and understanding your audience’s search behavior. A small tweak here or there rarely makes a big difference without a consistent plan.

Another thing I noticed is communication. Some agencies focus on reports full of graphs and jargon, but they don’t explain what’s actually happening or what actions you should take next. The best services guide you through the process, prioritize tasks, and focus on results that matter — like traffic quality, leads, or conversions, not just rankings.

Local SEO also has its own quirks. Search behavior in your city or neighborhood can be very different from national trends, so a service that understands local intent can make a huge difference. For instance, optimizing for “best coffee shop near me” isn’t the same as targeting “coffee shops in India” — small changes can have a big impact.

Some things I’d love to hear from people who’ve tried local SEO:

* How did you choose a service that actually understood your business?
* Did you see real results within 3–6 months, or was it slower than expected?",1,1768806543.0,GoogleMyBusiness,1,1.0,False

The wife and I (both in 40s) are planning to spend a few days in your wonderful city on our way to the Eastern Townships for some skiing.  I'm struggling with what part of Montreal to stay in.  Sorry if this is kind of a dumb or often repeated question, but everything I can find about where to stay in Montreal focuses on summer and the various parks and getting around via bike (we'll be back in the summer for these things!).  We're going to be there in mid-February (14-17), so we have much different needs than the travel bloggers.

My wife has never been to Montreal and it's been about 25 years for me.  Might as well consider it a first visit for us. For what it's worth, we're visiting from Syracuse, NY, so no strangers to cold, snow and slush, but Montreal sounds like another level of cold.   We're going to a show at Centre Bell, want to hit some museums, check out architecture and of course eat lots of great food.  These things all seem to be in different parts of town. We hope to park our car and not drive while in Montreal.   

Right now it seems like a toss up between downtown and Plateu Mont Royal, or maybe Old Montreal.   Are any of these more interesting to walk around?  Especially at night.  Access to the subway seems good for all 3.  How about availability of good food/coffee/cocktails?

I've found an interesting looking hotel near Sherbrooke station and Square St. Louis, but I wonder if it's too far from things we want to see.  It's definitely close to a lot of food I want to check out.  How is that neighborhood?  Is it safe to walk around at night?

currently I **have a 2-cup south indian filter press, a french press, a hand milk frother and a basic automatic drip machine.**

I do **NOT have or plan on getting a coffee grinder or moka pot anytime soon.**

I have tried the below before:

\- **BT Attikan estate, vienna roast, kalledevarapura estate, Birthday blend** 

\- Attikan estate was okay, a bit basic for me - but I really liked the other **two, but couldn't have Birthday blend every other day.**

so I would prefer a medium to medium dark roast...

because I'm trying to cut costs while making use of as much of my equipment as possible Im thinking of getting a medium coarse grind that I can use with both my french press and drip machine. (yes I know it's recommended to use a coarser grind for french presses but I have got excellent results with the Hoffman technique that uses a finer grind - so I can hit two birds with one stone there)

I have a BT outlet near me that I can get freshly ground coffee from so I **want recommendations for which blend to get for an automatic drip machine.**

To earn extra income, I worked part time at an auto parts supplier while working full time in construction. The store owner often gave me extra hours to perform maintenance and repair work at his shop and other properties he owned. A property manager noticed the quality of my work and asked if I would be interested in doing work for him. I saw this as an opportunity to start my own business.

I completed work for them and they were happy with the results. After that, other properties under their management began contacting me for various tasks. At the first location, I built a strong reputation and they were impressed with my work. However, their opinion of me now seems to be changing. They have started accusing me of breaking things that I never touched or worked on.

For example, I was asked to install a receptacle and turned off a circuit to complete the work. After I finished, I began painting a wall. Shortly after, the manager came running over claiming their coffee machine was showing a water filtration error. They blamed me, saying it had worked before I came in, even though I had no knowledge of the issue and never touched the machine.

I guess that I’ll just start at the beginning. I was driving home, listening to music, and trying to decompress after a long and tiring day. The back roads were empty, and the shadows were growing longer as the sunlight faded. I left the clinic in a hurry, wanting to plop down onto my couch and bask in the luxurious silence of an empty apartment. However, that monotonous drive was interrupted when I received a call from Taylor General Hospital. I figured it was another call to schedule one of my grandmother’s appointments. They could never get her to answer her own phone, so it didn’t surprise me.

“Is this Ms. Clifton’s granddaughter, Carrie? You were her emergency contact on file,” said the employee.

It was not the regular chipper girl who called about scheduling. This wasn’t concerning an appointment at all, and I felt a nervous tinge in the back of my head.

“I am,” I replied, feeling a lump forming in my throat.

“My name is Trina. I’m a nurse at Taylor General Hospital. Your grandmother collapsed after leaving her check-up appointment today.”

That conversation changed everything. I drove three hours to Taylor General Hospital in rural Mississippi to discover that my grandmother had suffered a debilitating stroke, and she would need around the clock care. Life can change quickly, and I certainly was unprepared. But I don't think anyone is.

You may be wondering why I was her only emergency contact, but the answer is simple. She raised me, and she is my paternal grandmother. That’s all there is to it. We’ve always had each other since my parents didn’t hang around long enough to see me grow up. My mother found drugs, and my dad… well I know he’s dead. How he died is still a mystery, and no one has seen my mom in twelve years. I suspect that she is dead as well. Through it all, I’ve always had my grandmother. She has always been the one constant in my life, and now, I’m losing her as well. But people don’t live forever, even if we wish they could.

I am now her caregiver. I moved back to my hometown, Juniper, and I’m not so sure that I’m going to stay after she passes. I thought about hiring someone to live with her, but I decided that I could manage on my own. I’m a nurse by trade, so I’m able to do most of the dirty work by myself. I change her, feed her, and bathe her. She’s on hospice now, and the hospice nurse comes by almost everyday to check on us. She’s a sweet woman with perfectly straightened hair and big brown eyes. She always asks me if I’m doing okay, and I always give her the generic “I’m doing fine.” The truth is… watching someone die is draining, and it isn’t like you imagine it. It is quiet, empty, and it has a certain kind of smell. It is a sharp scent, and it doesn’t leave your nose no matter where you go.

My grandmother can’t talk anymore. She mumbles something here and there while she sleeps, and when she wakes up, she stares at the wall. She’s only a feeble shell of who she used to be. The light in her eyes is somewhere else, dulled by her medicine and poisoned by her stroke.

Since I’ve moved back into my childhood home, all I do is clean. I turn on the tv for my grandmother if she is awake, and I get right to it. The house was a wreck when I came back two days before she was supposed to leave the hospital. Apparently, things were not as good as she led me to believe. I had only been away for a year since I finished nursing school and bought my own apartment. Of course, she couldn’t tell me anything now, but from what I can gather… she’d developed some interesting new habits. She’d started hoarding boxes, old cartons, wicker baskets, ill-fitting clothes, and silk flowers. There were bags upon bags of silk flowers, stacked to the ceiling like skyscrapers. I didn’t know that one could purchase so many silk flowers, and I thought I might die after a mountain of them fell on me. I was able to clear a pathway through to the main dining room where her hospice bed was set up, and I’ve been going through room after room and just throwing away and pillaging through her hoard. I bag it up, take it outside, and burn it. None of it is sentimental, and it is all garbage to me. She wasn’t living alone either. She’d picked up some little woodland friends… mice… rats… and from the skeletons I found in one of the bedrooms, I’d a say a family of squirrels was massacred by an avalanche of wicker baskets and boxes.

I just don’t understand. Why did she hide her ailing mental state from me? How could she live like this? She used to be a clean freak. She’d wash a porcelain sink four times until it shined. I should have come back sooner. I’d planned to come this Christmas since I wasn’t scheduled to work. I feel like a failure.

Her house used to be a beautiful bed and breakfast that everyone used to love to stay at. There are six guest bedrooms, and a master suite that always served as our main living space. It takes up the entire top floor of the house. It has its own kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom area. When I was little, I used to sleep with her on the master bed with my favorite stuffed animal. Now, the entire master suite serves as a graveyard for her mounds of trash, decaying woodland friends, and junk. I considered hiring someone to go through this absolute trash heap, but instead, I use it as my therapy. Throwing away the trash, burning it, and taking care of my grandmother gets me through the day. I’m exhausted, but it is better than feeling the horrible ache of grief swelling through my body like a balloon. I’d rather collapse on the couch and pass out than feel a single tinge of bitter sadness creeping up on me. It is easier to push it all away than actually cope. I’m sure that you probably understand… or maybe you don’t, and I’m assuming too much.

The night before my grandmother died she started talking in her sleep very loudly. It was so loud that she woke me up as I laid on the couch beside her bed. Usually she slept soundly, but the last few nights she kept trying to get up. She’d groan and try to lift her body, but that is sometimes a side effect of the morphine, a jarring restlessness. And tonight, it was disturbing pieces and parts of words as she attempted to rise again.

“Gram,” I said, slowly getting up and rubbing my eyes. “Do you need something?”

Her mouth was moving up and down, but no words were coming out. It was just hushed whispers of vowels and consonants. You could hear her tongue and teeth clacking together as she tried to produce audible sounds again. The left side of her face still had a visible droop, and a nasally whistle came through her nose as her poor failing body struggled to speak to me.

I took a deep breath, rubbing through her hair. “Gram, do you want some water?”

She nodded, and I grabbed her cup and her straw. I placed the straw into her mouth, and she swallowed quickly. She smacked her lips together and went back to sleep. I called my friend, Anna, who is a hospice nurse, and she answered, knowing that it was important if I was calling her so late.

“Carrie,” she said quietly. “John is sleeping, so let me leave our bedroom. Are you okay?”

“She keeps talking in her sleep. Is that normal?”

Anna sighed. “Yeah. It is normal with the sleep aids that she is taking. But I asked if you were okay. Are you?”

I sat back down on the couch. “You know that I’m not, but who would be in this situation?”

“Carrie… It is hard. You can call me to talk any time. Do you need help? I can make the drive to you.”

“No,” I replied quickly. “Anna it is such a mess here. I’ve been able to clean out most of the lower level of the house, but the master suite is a nightmare. Besides, I wouldn’t be okay letting you sleep on the other old couch.”

Anna chuckled. “You let me know if you change your mind, okay?”

“I will. Now go on back to bed. You’ve got work tomorrow. Sorry that I woke you up.”

“It’s fine. Goodnight,” she said in a whisper.

“Goodnight.”

I ended the call and sat back into the couch. The room was dark, but moonlight poured in from the windows. I was able to see, so I wasn’t concerned. I titled my head back, and I looked up at the ceiling, watching the shadows of tree branches thumping together as the wind blew outside. A stray branch scraped against the side of the house, and I jumped. I sighed and made a mental note to cut the damn crepe myrtles outside. They had grown wild, sprouting more branches than I had ever seen. They didn’t resemble the perfect pink puff balls along the house that I once remembered. The entire house was no longer the blissful country home that I once remembered. Like my grandmother… it was now only an empty shell of what would have been a once loving home for everyone who needed a warm bed.

I heard a sharp intake of breath, and I turned my gaze back to my grandmother. She began to mumble again. I inched closer to her, smelling the rancid odor of her breath. I knew that smell. It was the smell that only dying people emit. I knew that her time was coming. I leaned my ear closer to her mouth, and I was able to make out three words.

“Feed… the… house.”

“What?” I asked nervously. I held tightly onto the metal rung of her hospice bed. “What do you mean?” My words came out shakily, and I leaned even closer to her.

“The house… needs to be… fed.”

She suddenly grabbed my hand, and her other arm flailed as she tried to grab my hair. Her fingers grazed my cheek, and I tried to pry her hand off of mine. Her fingernails dug into my skin, and her knuckles burned white in the darkness of the room. Her eyes were wide, staring upwards at the ceiling… seeing something that I simply couldn’t. I couldn’t move. I was horrified. I had seen patients die, but none of them looked like this. She looked… scared. Her lips quivered, shaking the little amount of flesh that covered her facial bones. I couldn’t quite decide what she saw, but I was sure that I never wanted to see it either. I was able to rip my hand from her grasp, and I looked down to see purple whelps forming on my skin. She had grabbed me with inhumane strength, and I didn’t understand. Maybe I wouldn’t ever.

One thing was for certain. She wanted her house fed, and I wasn’t sure what that meant.

She died the next day in the early hours. I knew it was coming, and I hated that she left me with such a horrific memory. The funeral was three days later on a Friday. I still had bruises and little red crescent moons from her fingernails on my hand. Everyone in my hometown came. It was the busiest funeral that I had ever witnessed. The mayor came with his wife, and they made what felt like an extreme effort to learn my future plans for my grandmother’s house. The sheriff and his wife came. Old classmates and their parents. It was insane in my opinion. She didn’t know half of these people, and I surely didn’t know them either.

One of my grandmother’s frequent guests at the bed and breakfast came up to me and gave his condolences. He was an older man with greying hair and a thin grey mustache. “You plannin’ to stay here and clean up the place? I think the bed and breakfast deserves a second chance. It has been run by the Clifton family since this town was founded.”

My mouth went dry. “I haven’t really thought that much into it. I’m a nurse, so I figure that I’ll have to sell it.”

His face turned a hot shade of red. “You can’t do that! You don’t know what you are doing. What would your grandmother say?” Spittle shot from his mouth as he continued to fuss. “You simply can’t sell it.”

I stared at him, trying to decide why it bothered him so much. People turned to look at him, hearing his loud voice over the conversations around them. I decided to give him an answer to placate him since I didn’t want him yelling at me during the visitation.

“Mr. Havers… I haven’t made any decisions yet,” I replied lowly. “I’d appreciate it if you’d lower your voice as well. People are staring.”

He looked around, and he smiled. He straightened his suit. “Good… You need to think of Juniper. You are now one of the founding members since your grandmother has passed. It is your responsibility to keep this town thriving. I’m sure that you’ll make the right choice.”

He left quickly, nearly knocking someone over as he hurried away. Everyone stared at him as he left, but they did not seem as shocked as I was. He had always been nice to my grandmother.

I felt my cheeks burn and tears welling up. I forced them down, and I looked around, hoping to spot someone I knew. I needed someone to take my mind off of Mr. Havers. One of the police officers who had come walked to check on me. He looked familiar, but I couldn’t remember how I knew him.

“Are you okay, Carrie?” he asked. He was a younger man with reddish hair and hazel eyes.

“I’m fine. Everyone is acting so crazy today. I just don’t understand,” I whispered.

He shrugged. “Funerals make everyone crazy. My name is Phillip. You might remember me from school. I moved away, but I got a job here when I finished police academy.”

I nodded, remembering the geeky kid who moved away when we were freshman. “Phillip Masterson,” I said, frowning. “Layton Meyers used to pick on you really bad. I remember you. I’m sorry I didn’t intervene to help you.”

“No worries… No one wanted to stand up to him.” Phillip smiled. “Now Layton Meyers is a drunkard and lost his drivers license, so I think I’m safe for now.” He chuckled.

He sat down beside me, drinking a cup of lemonade from the refreshment table. “When did you get back?” he asked.

“About three weeks ago.”

“I started working here about a month ago, so what have you been doing?” he asked, trying to be friendly.

 “I’ve been cleaning out my grandmother’s house and taking care of her. She let it fall into ruin, and truthfully, the whole thing needs to bulldozed.”

I looked out at the crowd of people. They were socializing like this was a family event. “I don’t understand how all of these people are here for the funeral, but no one went over there to check on her. Surely, she had friends who cared enough to drop by. Assholes...” I stopped myself. “I’m sorry. That was mean to say.”

He took a deep breath. “Mean or not… it is the truth. So many people used to go to your grandmother’s bed and breakfast, and the town grew because her incredible gardens brought tourists. I think it’s a shame that none of them bothered to check in on her while you were gone.”

I looked up at him, grateful to have someone who seemed to understand. He stood up, preparing to leave, but I stopped him.

“Phillip, what do you know about the bed and breakfast? My grandmother told me some strange stuff when she was lucid.”

He looked taken aback. “I don't know much,"" he whispered. ""I can grab some records from city hall and bring them by tomorrow. I can also help you clean. I’m off tomorrow if you’d like some help and some company.”

I nodded. “I’d like that very much.”

He smiled. “I’ll bring coffee.” He walked off and headed out the door of the funeral home.

After the funeral ended and she was lowered into her grave, I drove back to my grandmother’s house all alone. I stared out the window, thumbing over the steering wheel. I suddenly noticed how much larger Juniper had grown since I left. Yet the people who had always lived here still remained. I was the only one that seemed to escape. Everywhere around us is farmland and large expanses of thick woods, so Juniper is the only place that many come to for other necessities or entertainment. They finally built a movie theatre, and the old mall closed down. But they were expanding. I could see the shell of new homes and new buildings sprouting up everywhere, and it made me wonder why they were so keen on preserving the now rotting bed and breakfast. I couldn’t help but think about Mr. Havers.

He must know something.

I’m sure of it, and maybe we find out together.

I’m really into light roasts and usually gravitate toward Ethiopian or other African coffees. I’m hoping to find places where I can buy good freshly roasted beans to take home, but also grab a latte once in a while.

So far I’ve tried Revel 77, Brew Peddler, Indaba, Ladder Coffee, and First Avenue Coffee. I’ve liked all of them for different reasons, but I’m sure I’m missing some great spots.

The only problem is that the range of flavors for CarbSmart is still really limited. I've only seen Neopolitan, Mint, Vanilla, and Chocolate so far. I miss coffee, cherry, and other adventures.

1qgwrye,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1qgwrye/the_psychology_of_dating_8_stages_nobody_talks/,The Psychology of Dating: 8 Stages Nobody Talks About (Science-Based Breakdown),"Look, dating isn't some fairy tale where you meet someone and boom, happily ever after. It's messy, confusing, and full of stages that most people stumble through blind. After diving deep into relationship psychology research, podcasts from Esther Perel, and books by attachment theory experts, I realized something: most relationship failures happen because people don't understand what stage they're in or what's supposed to happen next. They think something's wrong when actually, they're just transitioning. So here's the real breakdown of the 8 stages of dating, what actually happens in each one, and how to not fuck it up.

## Stage 1: The Fantasy Phase (Weeks 1-3)

This is where your brain is basically high on drugs. Literally. Your dopamine and oxytocin levels are through the roof. Everything they do is cute. Their weird laugh? Adorable. The way they chew? Charming. You're not seeing a real person yet, you're seeing a projection of what you want them to be.

**What to do:** Enjoy it, but don't make massive life decisions. Don't move in together. Don't tattoo their name on your ass. Just ride the wave and stay present. This phase is fun as hell, but it's not reality yet.

## Stage 2: The Anxiety Creep (Month 2-3)

Reality starts knocking. You notice they leave dishes in the sink. They're not texting back as fast. Your anxious attachment style starts screaming ""THEY'RE LOSING INTEREST"" while your avoidant side whispers ""maybe I should bail first."" This is where most people panic and either cling harder or ghost.

**What to do:** Breathe. This is normal. Your nervous system is adjusting. According to Dr. Sue Johnson in *Hold Me Tight* (a book that will honestly make you understand relationships better than any rom-com ever could), this is when your attachment system gets activated. Instead of freaking out, communicate. Say ""hey, I noticed we're texting less, just checking in."" Simple. Direct. No games.

## Stage 3: The Reality Check (Month 4-6)

The fantasy fog clears. You see their flaws. They're not perfect. Neither are you. Maybe they're terrible with money. Maybe you're annoyingly controlling about plans. This is where compatibility actually gets tested. About 50% of relationships end here because people think ""if it's right, it should be easy."" Wrong. If it's right, you'll both be willing to work through the hard stuff.

**What to do:** Get curious, not critical. Instead of thinking ""they're so irresponsible with money,"" think ""how can we navigate our different financial styles?"" Read *Attached* by Amir Levine if you haven't already. It's the best damn book on understanding attachment styles in relationships. You'll finally get why you do the weird shit you do in relationships.

## Stage 4: The Deep Dive (Month 6-12)

You start sharing the heavy stuff. Childhood wounds. Past relationships. Your fears about the future. This is vulnerable as hell and honestly terrifying. But this is where real intimacy builds. Not the rom-com version, the actual ""I see your darkness and I'm not running"" version.

**What to do:** Be brave enough to share but also respect their pace. Not everyone opens up on your timeline. Try the app Paired, it's basically a daily workout for your relationship. Sends you questions to discuss with your partner that actually matter, not just ""what's your favorite color"" surface level crap.

## Stage 5: The Power Struggle (Year 1-2)

Welcome to the battlefield. This is where you're fighting about whose family to visit for holidays, whose career takes priority, how to split chores. It's not sexy. It's not fun. But it's where you learn if you can actually be a team or if you're just two people who like making out.

**What to do:** Fight fair. Learn about nonviolent communication. The podcast *Where Should We Begin?* with Esther Perel will blow your mind, she records actual couples therapy sessions and you'll hear yourself in every damn episode. Also, stop trying to win arguments. Start trying to understand.

## Stage 6: The Stability Phase (Year 2-3)

Things calm down. You've got routines. You know how they take their coffee. You can predict their mood. This feels safe but also kind of boring. Some people freak out here and think ""is this all there is?"" and start looking for excitement elsewhere.

**What to do:** Maintain mystery and autonomy. Just because you're committed doesn't mean you merge into one boring blob. Keep your hobbies. Have separate friend groups. According to relationship researcher John Gottman, successful couples maintain a balance between intimacy and independence. Read *Eight Dates* by the Gottmans, it'll give you actual conversation starters that reignite curiosity about your partner.

There's also BeFreed, an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni that's worth checking out. It pulls from relationship psychology books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content. If you're trying to navigate attachment styles or communication patterns, you can ask it to build a learning plan around ""becoming a better partner"" or ""understanding anxious attachment in relationships."" It synthesizes insights from sources like the books mentioned above and turns them into podcasts you can listen to during your commute. You can customize the depth too, from quick 15-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The content is science-based and fact-checked, which matters when you're trying to improve something as important as your relationship skills.

## Stage 7: The Recommitment (Year 3+)

You actively choose them again. Not because you're stuck or scared to be alone, but because you genuinely want this person in your life. You've seen them at their worst and you're still here. This is the stage where you decide if you're building a life together or just coasting.

**What to do:** Get intentional. Have the big conversations. Kids or no kids. City or suburbs. Career ambitions. Don't assume you're on the same page just because you've been together a while. Try Ash, an AI relationship coach app that helps you navigate tough conversations without feeling like you need an actual therapist every week.

## Stage 8: The Partnership Evolution (Year 5+)

You're not just lovers anymore, you're partners. Co-creators of a life. You've weathered storms together. You know how to repair after fights. You've probably grown and changed as individuals but figured out how to grow together. This doesn't mean it's always easy, but it means you've built something real.

**What to do:** Keep choosing each other. Keep dating. Don't get lazy just because you're comfortable. Schedule weekly check-ins. Ask each other ""how can I support you this week?"" The moment you stop investing is the moment things start dying.

## The Real Talk

Here's what nobody tells you: every stage has an exit ramp. You can bail at any point. But most people bail at the wrong times, during transitions or growth phases, thinking something's wrong when actually, they're right on track. The key is knowing what's normal discomfort versus actual incompatibility.

Dating isn't linear. You might bounce between stages. You might get stuck in one. But understanding the map helps you navigate without losing your damn mind. These stages aren't about finding the perfect person, they're about becoming the kind of person who can build something lasting with an imperfect human.

Stop expecting dating to be a smooth ride. It's supposed to be challenging. That's how you build something strong enough to last.",1,1768804470.0,Datingat21st,0,1.0,False

1qgwnxt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qgwnxt,Wake up/Human gym routine,"Hi, just seeking some advice. This is my 7month old standard Aussie boy “Iroh”. Been a rough 5 months getting used to each other and a move of house (house purchase) has made settling a bit tricky. But we’re finally getting into a routine. 

The advice I’m seeking is, that I’m an early morning gym rat. I haven’t been able to train since picking him up at 10 weeks old. I would like to get back into my routine of 6-8am gym sessions. 

Currently he wakes up bang on 5:30am, he goes into the garden for first potty break and we chill for 30-1hr before I feed him breakfast. He’s usually asleep at my feet while I have my coffee. 

I then give him breakfast at 6/6:30 and do a force crate nap to teach him that after food we rest for an hr. Trying to prevent bloating. Once he’s up from his post breakfast nap we do a 45-1hr walk, a mixture of obedience training and fetch work. Then he comes in and settles before I start WFH. We do some more obedience training with his lunch, 2nd walk/more training at 4-5 then dinner is at 6:30pm. He’s usually passed out from 7:30/8pm until we put him to bed in his crate at 10pm. Then asleep until 5:30am again. 

This routine has been working but my gym sessions have been none existent and it’s now messing with my mental and physical health. 

Just seeking some advice on when might be best to feed him his first meal, get his first walk in and get my gym sessions in for myself. 

No idea what’s right as he’s my first pup and wanna do everything right by him but I’m losing myself in the process. Any advice would be appreciated.

Also, we are trying to figure out a “job” for him. Currently going through some gun dog training and once he’s old enough would love to do some agility and frisbee work with him.

Any advice would be appreciated and please don’t be too brutal with me if I’m messing up. I’m happy to learn and adapt for his betterment.",7,1768804092.0,AustralianShepherd,0,1.0,False

So one day during church (I’m orthodox) I find out that my church has become very popular with the youth because our priest is younger, and right next to me across the aisle was a girl, and I’m not talking about just some girl, this is the first girl that made me feel something no one else had made me feel, and she was gorgeous, god put 100% into the making of her, and instantly for no reason I felt nervous and found it super hard to breath and when I looked over she was staring into my eyes and smiling, actually making eye contact. She did that throughout the whole sermon.

Then when the sermon finished I walked out with my little sister to go to the playground on the property while my parents got a coffee at the cafe and she was walking around there, then her grandma and dad came and talked to her an she walked away, then as I was about to go home she walked back to me and looked me up and down and smiled. My retarded ass did absolutely nothing about it, nothing can describe the feeling of regret I feel.
