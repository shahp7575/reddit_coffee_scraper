1kauu95,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1kauu95/a_new_relationship_chapter_1/,A new relationship - Chapter 1,"The Christmas market had been Olivia’s idea. After weeks of hesitant online messages, she had finally decided: *this* would be their first meeting. Not a casual coffee, not a hesitant walk in the park—no, something magical. Twinkling lights, the scent of mulled wine, the crunch of snow underfoot. Perfect.

Thomas had agreed immediately, though he’d had plans with friends that evening. *No matter*, he’d told himself. *I’ll make it work.*

When he pulled up to the bus stop where she’d asked him to pick her up, his breath caught. There she stood—tall, blonde, her cheeks pink from the cold, a soft smile playing on her lips. She looked even lovelier than in her pictures. Heart pounding, he rolled down the window.

""Hey, you must be Olivia?""

She tilted her head slightly, studying him for a moment before nodding. But she didn’t move toward the car.

Confused, Thomas hesitated. Was something wrong? Had he misunderstood the meeting spot? He unbuckled his seatbelt and stepped out, the cold air biting at his skin.

""Everything okay?"" he asked, closing the distance between them.

Olivia’s smile remained polite, but there was something deliberate in her gaze. When he leaned in instinctively for a greeting kiss, she turned her head slightly, offering her cheek instead.

""Ah,"" he murmured, brushing a light kiss there before pulling back, slightly flustered.

Then, with a small but firm laugh, she said, ""I was waiting for you to open the door for me.""

*Oh.*

Thomas blinked, then quickly moved to the passenger side, pulling the door open with an awkward chuckle. ""Right. Sorry about that.""

Olivia slid into the seat gracefully, adjusting her coat before looking up at him. ""No need to apologize. Just something to remember for next time.""

There was a beat of silence as he circled back to the driver’s side, his mind racing. *Next time.* She’d already assumed there would be one.

The moment the car started moving, Olivia filled the silence effortlessly.

""You know, I’ve been to this market before, but never with someone else. It’s nicer when you share it, don’t you think?"" She didn’t wait for an answer. ""Oh! And you have to try the food there—the best in the region. My ex never liked them, but I think he just had bad taste in general.""

Thomas chuckled, stealing glances at her as she spoke. Her voice was warm, animated, her hands gesturing as she recounted stories—her job, her family, her love of winter. He barely had to say a word; she carried the conversation like a river, smooth and unstoppable.

Then, a familiar holiday tune played on the radio. Olivia’s eyes lit up.

""Oh, I *love* this one!"" She reached over, turning up the volume, and began singing along, her voice light and surprisingly melodic. Thomas grinned, tapping his fingers on the wheel, content to listen.

When the song ended, she sighed happily, then immediately launched into another story—this time about a childhood memory involving a snowman and a mischievous dog. The drive passed in what felt like seconds, the car filled with her laughter, her voice, her presence.

And despite the slight strangeness of their first moments, Thomas couldn’t help but think: *She’s incredible.*

But he also wondered, just briefly, if he’d ever get a chance to speak.

Thomas parked the car at the edge of the city, where the rates were cheaper. The winter air was crisp, and the distant glow of the Christmas market lights flickered through the bare trees. He turned off the engine, glancing at Olivia with a satisfied smile.

""Here we are. Just a short walk to the market.""

Olivia tilted her head, her gloved hands resting neatly in her lap. ""What do you mean, *a short walk*?""

Thomas blinked. ""Well, the parking here is half the price of the ones closer to—""

She cut him off with a soft laugh, shaking her head. ""Oh, no no no. I know a better spot. Right next to the market.""

Before he could protest, she was already tapping the new location into his phone’s GPS. Thomas hesitated, then followed the directions—only to wince as they pulled into the premium parking area, the fee displayed in bold numbers.

*That’s almost triple what I’d have paid…*

But Olivia was already unbuckling her seatbelt, her eyes bright with anticipation. Swallowing his reluctance, he paid and parked.

As soon as the car stopped, Thomas stepped out, stretching his legs after the drive. Then he paused—Olivia hadn’t moved. She sat perfectly still, her gaze expectant.

A beat passed before it clicked.

*Right. The door.*

He hurried around the car, pulling it open with an apologetic smile. ""Sorry, I’ll… try to remember next time.""

Olivia stepped out, adjusting her scarf before patting his cheek lightly. ""I know you will. You’ll learn quickly, I’m sure.""

And with that, she took the lead, weaving through the snow-dusted streets toward the market, Thomas falling into step beside her. The air smelled of cinnamon and roasted chestnuts, and the sound of carols mingled with laughter. Olivia guided them effortlessly, pointing out stalls she liked, deciding which mulled wine stand had the best spices, which wooden ornaments were ""authentic enough."" Thomas listened, mesmerized by the way her cheeks flushed in the cold, the way her laughter rose like music above the crowd.

Then she stopped abruptly in front of a churros stand, the golden dough spiraling into hot oil.

""Do you like these?"" she asked, though her tone suggested the answer didn’t matter.

Thomas shrugged. ""Eh, not really. A bit too sugary for—""

""One portion, please!"" she called to the vendor, already digging in her purse. Thomas reached for his wallet, but she waved him off—only to hand him the receipt afterward with a sweet smile.

*Ah. So I’m paying.*

He did so without complaint, watching as she took the first bite, powdered sugar dusting her lips.

""Mmm—oh, these are terrible!"" She frowned, holding the churro at arm’s length. ""They’re already cold. Here, try.""

Before he could refuse, she pressed a piece into his mouth. Thomas chewed dutifully.

""Yeah, not great,"" he admitted.

""Exactly!"" Olivia sighed, as if he’d confirmed her deepest suspicions. Then she handed him the rest. ""Here, finish them.""

1kaut6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1kaut6w/i_hurt_someone_and_it_feels_wrong/,I hurt someone and it feels wrong.,"I finished school last year and my father told me to take a gap year to work for his company. I agreed because the real world experience was too good to pass up and honestly I've led a fairly sheltered life. I used to go to the office 3 days a week and took care of basically whatever I was told to do. It was tedious but also fun sometimes.

Now I've always been decently close to the company accountant's daughter (lets call her A) ever since he joined the company (5 years give or take). Not friends but friendly if that makes sense. She's the same age as me and was always an extremely driven and spirited person. I broke up with my then girlfriend towards the end of 12th and it was the kind of relationship that crashed and burned. Not fun. After that I started talking to A more frequently. 

We would text every day, share reels, meet up sometimes, just good fun. We also started flirting back and forth and I never took it seriously. I always thought of it like the fun flirty conversations one has with their friends you know just hypotheticals. It never crossed my mind that she might have feelings for me. I knew I didn't.   
  
Now around October of last year we were messing about and we sort of ended up making plans to hook up. Now I was clear from the start that this is a one off thing, and that I have no feelings involved, and that I don't want it to lead to anything. Part of the reason was that I was out of a really shitty relationship and I didn't want to involve someone else, partly because I didn't really have romantic feelings for her, and partly because if either of our dads found out I would be dead. Mainly because my father is very anal about professionalism and he's also really fond of A. 

Anyway long story short we ended up hooking up, we didn't go all the way, we went for coffee afterwards. Simple. Should be the end of the story. No. She asked me out afterwards and I told her no and she went ballistic. She said that I used her and that I didn't care about her. I really resent the using her allegation because we both consensually did what we did and I didn't use her anymore than she used me. In fact I was the one who wasn't hiding feelings and ulterior motives. We had a fight, she basically called and yelled at me for half an hour and I ended up blocking her. That should've been the end of that. 

Nope. I did feel some residual guilt about hurting her yes, but I rationalized it saying it was not my fault and unintentional. Of course there was also the sadness of losing a friend. Now recently things have been very touchy with my father because of career choices and colleges. Basically him wanting me to go abroad and study pharma so I can join the company full time and me wanting to stay here for my bachelors and study psychology.   
  
He found out about A and me and he absolutely lost it. He chewed me out called me quite a few things, most of them variations of skirt chaser and whore. But later that night I was on the roof chilling and he showed up with beers and we just had a long overdue heart to heart, you know father to son. Now things between me and dad are finally settled and we are back to our old and happy relationship but I can't help but feel a twinge of guilt in my heart regarding A. I know I did nothing wrong but I did hurt her. So yeah that's about it. Pretty long post I know. Just needed to get it out there. ",1,1745950383.0,OffMyChestIndia,1,1.0,False

Or just doesn’t like me?","Context: I’ve known this guy over 2 years. There’s attraction, chemistry, etc. but bad timing. He was in a relationship, but we definitely grew very close emotionally and agreed we’d be great together. 5 months ago, he found out his boyfriend was cheating, so they broke up. He told me it would take time to detangle from his ex as their lives were very intertwined. I would question him periodically and he’d assure me and answer all my questions, but I could tell he was growing less patient over the months.

Eventually he told me he likes me, but that he wanted to be alone for the time being (ie break from dating), and he can’t make any promises as to when he’ll be ready. Which I appreciated and have tried to live my life since then. He doesn’t ever initiate texts at this point, but does respond when I reach out. We see each other at the gym and are friendly. I recently saw him at the gym with another guy but he preemptively told me this guy had a partner and followed up with pics (unprompted). He told me I could always text him for coffee, and we’ve had coffee walks a few times over the last few weeks.

1kaupex,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuickWire/comments/1kaupex/5_simple_hacks_to_boost_your_productivity_how_to/,5 Simple Hacks to Boost Your Productivity: How to Get More Done Without Burning Out,"We’ve all been there—staring at an endless to-do list, feeling like we’re getting nowhere, and wondering how other people seem to accomplish so much with so little time. The truth is, productivity isn’t about working harder or longer—it’s about working smarter. Whether you’re trying to get more done at work, tackle personal projects, or just have a little more free time in your day, these five simple productivity hacks will help you become more efficient, stay focused, and avoid burnout.

# 1. The Power of the Pomodoro Technique: Work in Focused Bursts

One of the most effective ways to boost productivity is to break your work into smaller, manageable chunks. The Pomodoro Technique, developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s, is a time-management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks.

Here’s how it works:

* **Set a Timer for 25 Minutes**: Work on a task without any distractions for that entire time.
* **Take a 5-Minute Break**: Once the timer goes off, take a short break to rest your mind and body. This can be anything from grabbing a cup of coffee to stretching.
* **Repeat the Process**: After four cycles, take a longer break—about 15-30 minutes.

The Pomodoro Technique helps you stay focused, prevents burnout, and makes tasks feel less overwhelming. Plus, those short breaks refresh your brain, improving focus and creativity when you return to your work.

# 2. Prioritize with the Eisenhower Matrix: Tackle What Matters First

Not all tasks are created equal. Some tasks are urgent, some are important, and some are neither. The Eisenhower Matrix, named after President Dwight D. Eisenhower, helps you categorize your tasks to decide what needs your immediate attention and what can wait.

Here’s how it works:

* **Quadrant 1: Urgent and Important**: Tasks that need to be done immediately, such as responding to an urgent email or meeting a tight deadline.
* **Quadrant 2: Not Urgent but Important**: These are tasks that help you achieve long-term goals, like planning, brainstorming, or exercise. Make time for these.
* **Quadrant 3: Urgent but Not Important**: Tasks that need to be done soon, but don’t contribute significantly to your long-term goals. These can often be delegated.
* **Quadrant 4: Not Urgent and Not Important**: Tasks that don’t need your attention right now (e.g., scrolling through social media). Minimize or eliminate these tasks.

By prioritizing your tasks in this way, you can focus on what truly matters and avoid wasting time on things that won’t bring you closer to your goals.

# 3. The Two-Minute Rule: Stop Procrastinating on Small Tasks

Do you have a bunch of small tasks you keep putting off? It’s easy to think they’re not worth the effort, but this procrastination adds up and can slow you down. Enter the Two-Minute Rule—if a task will take two minutes or less to complete, do it right away.

This applies to things like:

* Responding to an email
* Organizing your desk
* Scheduling a meeting
* Paying a bill

Instead of putting these small tasks off, tackle them immediately. It clears mental clutter and prevents them from piling up and becoming overwhelming.

# 4. The 80/20 Rule: Focus on What Brings the Biggest Results

The 80/20 Rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, states that roughly 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. This rule can be applied to almost any area of life—from work projects to personal goals.

For example, at work, you might find that 20% of your clients bring in 80% of your revenue, or that 20% of your tasks contribute to 80% of your productivity. To work smarter, identify the most impactful tasks and focus your energy on those.

Here’s how to apply the 80/20 Rule:

* Identify the 20% of tasks or projects that contribute the most value.
* Spend more time on these high-value activities and less time on the ones that don’t move the needle as much.

By doing this, you’ll ensure that your efforts are aligned with the tasks that matter most, boosting productivity without stretching yourself too thin.

# 5. Declutter Your Workspace: Clear Space, Clear Mind

It’s difficult to be productive when your environment is chaotic. A cluttered workspace can lead to mental clutter, making it hard to focus on the task at hand. Whether you work from home or in an office, take a few minutes each day to organize your workspace. Here’s how:

* **Tidy Up**: Spend 5-10 minutes at the end of each day putting away loose papers, organizing files, and clearing off your desk.
* **Declutter Digitally**: Clear your desktop and organize your digital files. A clean, organized computer will help you stay focused and reduce the time you spend searching for documents.
* **Create a Designated Workspace**: If you work from home, try to set up a specific area dedicated to work. This will help your brain switch into ""work mode"" when you sit down.

A clean workspace reduces distractions and can help improve your focus and mental clarity.

# Bonus Tip: The Power of Saying “No”

One of the biggest productivity killers is over-commitment. Saying “yes” to everything can spread you thin and make it harder to focus on your most important tasks. Practice the art of saying “no” when you’re asked to take on something that doesn’t align with your priorities.

Being selective about what you commit to gives you more time and energy for the tasks that truly matter. And don’t feel guilty—remember, saying “no” is saying “yes” to your time and well-being.

# Wrap-Up: Start Small, See Big Changes

Productivity isn’t about working nonstop—it’s about finding smarter, more efficient ways to use your time. By implementing just one or two of these hacks into your routine, you’ll see a significant difference in how much you get done and how much energy you have left at the end of the day. Remember: Small changes add up, and consistency is key.

I want to pull from the source table above to fill in the verified hours and department (see below). I'm having trouble thinking through the logic of using Xlookup and IF functions. This is assuming I use the ID # as the lookup value.



My criteria is that is that hours worked will be pulled from one department first, and if there are hours left it will be pulled from the second department, and so on. If first two departments have no hours, it will all be pulled from the third.



Criteria (only look for Milk, Coffee, and Soda):  

Pull from Milk dept. first.  

Then pull from Coffee dept.  

Then pull from Soda dept.  

If the source data shows more hours than the hours I want to verify, limit it to hours I'm verifying (see 1/17/25 below).  

If none of the above have any hours, enter 0.



Here's an example of what it should look like (the red are the data I wanted filled in):

Goal? Unsure. Taking it one day at a time at the moment!  
I started Zep in April of 2024 and my life has completely changed! I feel better than ever and I enjoy being in photos now. I lose 1-2 pounds per week, haven't experienced any hair loss, and had a small bout of GI issues when I switched to 7.5 - that lasted about 3 weeks and I realized I was actually eating too much fiber after shot days and I was bloating like crazy then feeling yucky. I prioritize protein, fiber, and whole foods. I have almost completed eliminated processed foods from my diet (I enjoy a diet coke every now and again and I do have a Cafe Late Premier Protein shake each morning, with added cold brew coffee). I engage in exercise that makes me happy (hiking, biking, dancing, and swimming) about 3-5 times per week.  
I did serious tracking when I first started but then life got busy and I really only track my weight at this point. And even then, I sometimes miss my weekly weigh-ins. I hope to have a kiddo in the next 3-5 years, so I'll have to pause at some point. I don't hate the idea of maintenance for life. We'll see where the science goes!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the age-old tale of David versus Goliath, except this time David is wearing a Real Madrid jersey and Goliath is an Olympiacos squad that seems to have Madrid's number on speed dial. Real Madrid, the team that has been as consistent as a cat on a hot tin roof, finds itself in a must-win situation against a team that has already beaten them four times this season. Talk about déjà vu, right?

The odds are slightly in favor of Real Madrid, with DraftKings giving them a price of 1.62 to Olympiacos' 2.36. But let's be real, those odds are about as comforting as a lukewarm cup of coffee on a Monday morning. Real Madrid needs to win, and not just by a hair, but by a margin that would make even their most optimistic fans raise an eyebrow.

Coach Chus Mateo is focusing on defense, which is a bit like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic if the offense doesn't show up. Players like Facundo Campazzo and Walter Tavares need to channel their inner basketball gods if they want to avoid an early vacation. Meanwhile, Olympiacos is probably feeling as relaxed as a cat in a sunbeam, knowing they've got the upper hand.

Now, let's talk bets. The spread is set at -3.5 for Real Madrid, which means they need to win by at least four points. Given their track record against Olympiacos, betting on them to cover the spread is riskier than trying to teach a cat to fetch. Instead, the best bet might be to take Olympiacos with the points. At 1.89 for a +3.5 spread on DraftKings, it seems like a safer bet than trusting Real Madrid to suddenly find their groove.

In conclusion, unless Real Madrid has been hiding some secret weapon or has a motivational speech from a Hollywood movie up their sleeves, Olympiacos looks poised to continue their dominance. So, grab your popcorn and enjoy the show, because this could be a classic case of history repeating itself.

1kaubnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1kaubnv/javy_protein_coffeeis_it_actually_worth_trying/,Javy Protein Coffee—Is It Actually Worth Trying?,"If you're anything like me, you've probably seen **Javy Protein Coffee** pop up in ads, social media, or countless online discussions recently. Honestly, I was skeptical. Protein and coffee combined sounded intriguing, but would it taste decent? Would it genuinely offer benefits, or was this just another fad? After seeing mixed **Javy coffee reviews**, I decided to give it a shot myself, drinking it every day for the past month. Here's my totally transparent take on whether it’s worth trying or not.

**Why I Gave Javy Coffee a Chance**

First off, my usual morning routine consisted of expensive café lattes and snacks—great for taste buds, not so great for my wallet or my energy crashes around 10 am. I wanted something simple, affordable, and nutritious. After checking out the **Javy coffee ingredients**, I found it offered 20 grams of whey protein, natural caffeine from Arabica coffee, and prebiotics. No weird chemicals or tons of sugar. Intrigued enough, I ordered the Original flavor from their site ([**here’s the link if you're curious**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JGN6WHK/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)).

**Taste and Texture: Honest Thoughts**

My biggest fear about **Javy coffee protein** was the dreaded chalkiness or weird aftertaste that typically comes with protein drinks. I braced myself, mixed two scoops into cold almond milk, and was genuinely surprised—it tasted nothing like I expected. It was smooth, pleasant, and mild, with a real coffee flavor. No chalkiness, no gritty residue left behind. If you're expecting rich, barista-quality espresso, you might be slightly disappointed, but honestly, for a protein coffee, the taste exceeded my expectations by a lot.

**How Did it Impact Energy and Hunger?**

The main reason I stuck with it daily was the balanced energy I experienced. Usually, coffee alone leaves me jittery, and I’d crash before lunch. With **Javy Protein Coffee**, though, the protein seemed to balance the caffeine perfectly. My energy stayed consistent, steady, and crash-free all morning. Another benefit was noticeably reduced hunger and sugar cravings throughout the morning. I was skeptical about this at first, but after two weeks, I really saw the difference—less snacking, fewer cravings, and overall healthier choices.

**Unexpected Bonus: Gut Health**

Something I didn't initially pay much attention to was the prebiotics included in **Javy coffee ingredients**. But after a few weeks, my digestion felt noticeably smoother, with far less bloating throughout the day. While subtle, it was a welcomed perk.

I even found a useful online quiz to help choose the right option for my lifestyle ([**you can check out the quiz here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JGN6WHK/?uid=34951&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)).

**Cost and Convenience: Is It Worth the Money?**

Initially, the price—about $30 per bag—felt a bit steep. But doing the math, it averaged out to around $1.50 per serving. Compared to daily $5 café drinks, I realized I actually saved quite a bit. Plus, mixing it at home in less than two minutes saved me time, too. So, financially and convenience-wise, it genuinely made sense.

**A Couple of Downsides**

Nothing’s perfect, so here’s what I found less than ideal: It’s instant coffee, so true coffee aficionados might miss that fresh, robust espresso taste. Additionally, the whey protein means it’s not dairy-free (it has a tiny amount of lactose), something to keep in mind if you're very lactose sensitive.

**Final Verdict: Would I Recommend It?**

After a full month, I can confidently say I enjoyed it. It simplified my mornings, reduced snack cravings, stabilized energy, and honestly tasted pretty good. While not a miracle drink, **Javy Protein Coffee** definitely made my mornings healthier and easier, and I'll keep using it.

Anyone else tried **Javy coffee** lately? I'd love to know your thoughts or answer any questions!",1,1745949213.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

I live in a third-world country and will be in Europe (Portugal) in June. I’m looking to buy a coffee grinder and plan to spend up to €200. Since I’ll only be in Porto for five days, it would be ideal to order from Amazon to ensure on-time delivery.

I brew using a Hario V60 and a Moka pot. I am the only person in the house that drinks coffee, so the quantity that it can grind does not matter.

The ""Ode 2"" seems to be the way to go, but I cost more than I could pay. It can be a manual grinder, no problems about that. Completely open to suggestions.



Thank you!

1kau7hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kau7hs/had_to_send_this_letter_somewhere_not_to_her/,"Had to send this letter somewhere, not to her.","Dear You,

I’ve been trying to figure out how to write this without sounding bitter, broken, or like a character in a sad indie film. But who am I kidding? If you’re reading this—scratch that, I doubt you are—then this is probably already checking all those boxes.

I still don’t know why you did it.
One day we were talking about kids—tiny humans with messy hair and mismatched socks—and the next… silence. No warning. No “We need to talk.” No slow fade. Just—“Let’s take a break.” Four words. No punctuation. Like a gentle push off a cliff.

It’s funny (and by funny, I mean soul-crushing) how quickly everything ended.
You weren’t just my girlfriend. You were my best friend. My partner in crime. The only person who understood why I always checked if the door was locked after locking it.
Ten years.
Gone faster than a cheap paper towel soaks up a spill.

And yes, I would’ve fought for us. I would’ve argued, debated, negotiated, grovelled even—had you given me the chance. But you didn’t. You pulled the parachute and left me in freefall, staring at the same blank screen you probably typed those words on.

I still haven’t found closure.
I waited. For a text. A call. Smoke signals. Anything.
I waited for a year, in case you were testing some twisted theory about distance and time. Turns out, I wasn’t in an experiment. I was just… forgotten.

Now, I’m beginning to forget things too. Not dramatically. Not like in movies where someone burns photos and screams into the void.
Just slowly.
Casually.
The kind of forgetting that sneaks in through repetition—like when I stop mentioning your name out loud because it doesn’t roll off the tongue as easily anymore.

But the scar? Oh, that’s still there.
You left it without even touching me. That takes talent.

I hope this tear stops showing up for you. I really do. It’s become a bit of a drama queen lately—popping up during songs, smells, cities, coffee shops.
I hope I forget the letters I wrote and never sent, the what-ifs I clung to, the late-night arguments I rehearsed alone just in case you came back.

I hope we don’t run into each other. Not because I hate you—because I’d rather keep the version of you I remember, than face the awkward silence between two people who once planned everything and now say nothing.
Because nothing is louder than that silence.
And without closure, it echoes.
Louder still when one person holds on
and the other lets go like it was nothing.

So, here it is. The unsent letter.
No dramatic ending.
Just gratitude for the good parts.
Resentment for the way you left.
And a weird mix of both for everything in between.

Thank you for the memories.
And for the ghosting.
Spectacular job on that, by the way.

Take care. Or don’t.
I’m not really in charge of that anymore.

Isn’t it so interesting how the addict brain works? I’m quite interested just observing it in myself. I am feeling absolutely horrific today and did yesterday as well. Just a black cloud of anger and depression over my mood. Not wanting to talk to anyone at work and just blasting music in my headphones all day. I am usually quite chatty and sociable too, so this is different for me. Even in the way I am writing this, my addict brain is saying “well, you should be in a good mood at work or you may get fired, so just start drinking coffee again”. It’s so interesting to just watch the arguments it comes up with to try and get its drug. 

Sleep has also been pretty bad the past couple nights and I just feel bad and hopeless about everything. Amazing how difficult this drug is to get off of and how society just accepts it. Both of my parents growing up were very “straight edge” in the sense of thinking that drugs were the worst thing on the planet and always telling me how bad they are, yet of course both of my parents drank coffee and somehow didn’t make the connection that that makes them drug addicts. 

Even a month or so ago I was talking to my dad about this amd essentially making this argument and he was like “i’m not addicted, i could quit at any time” to which I told him to try quitting for a week to which he said he would no problem, but of course he still hasn’t tried. I also made the analogy that imagine caffeine was a white powder that people had to snort every morning, and how that would change the perception of caffeine, to which he just said “i just like the process of drinking coffee and wouldn’t do it in that case”. It’s just amazing to me that most of society literally doesn’t see it as a drug and all these “straight edge” anti drug people don’t want to think of themselves as drug addicts, so they tell themselves that coffee is just coffee. 

This turned into a bit of a rant, but I just feel like shit and want to feel better. ",4,1745948896.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1kau5ck,https://i.redd.it/lkbnh9ff9txe1.jpeg,Coffee Grinds in valve? [Kenwood ES020],"I was inspired by Tom's Coffee Corner and started taking apart my espresso machine to really understand its maintenance. I found coffee grinds within this ""valve(?)"" between the vibratory pump and the water reservoir.  My question is multi-part:   

1. what is this part?

2. what does it do? 

3. How do I take it apart to clean it?",1,1745948786.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1kau59f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kau59f/could_the_fellow_aiden_coffee_maker_be_the_best/,Could the Fellow Aiden Coffee Maker Be the Best Precision Maker Review?,"The Fellow EBRMB-NA Aiden Coffee Maker is one of those devices that feel exciting even from the unboxing stage. Its minimalist, modern design in a matte black finish immediately grabbed my attention; It fits into a variety of kitchen aesthetics without screaming for attention. Honestly, I didn’t think a coffee maker could exude this level of sleekness, but here we are. Weighing in at a solid 15.4 pounds, it’s heavier than you'd expect, but that adds to the premium feel. I started thinking, ""if it looks this good, it better brew like a dream."" Spoiler alert: it mostly does.

**Performance and Features**  
Being a daily coffee drinker, I tested the coffee maker's claim of barista-quality brews. The built-in temperature control and precise water-to-coffee ratios did indeed produce coffee better than I’d ever achieved with my previous machines. The bloom cycle, designed to enhance the flavors, delivered a noticeable robustness in the coffee every time. Whether light, medium, or dark roast, it seemed like this machine knew exactly how to draw out the unique qualities of each.

[Ready to buy Fellow EBRMB-NA Aiden Coffee Maker? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d8hvbvs6/)

**Scheduling for Convenience**  
Can I just say: the scheduling feature is life-changing? Setting it to brew a fresh carafe right at 7 AM meant no more groggy coffee-making attempts before work. The app integration played a huge role here, too. I could adjust my brew time via my phone without even stepping into the kitchen. That’s convenience on a whole other level.

**Ease of Use and Customization**  
As someone who likes to experiment, I had an absolute blast with the customizable brew profiles. I could tweak the bloom time, temperature, and pulse rates to suit my taste. It even lets you download profiles created by your favorite coffee roasters! My partner, who’s less enthusiastic about tweaking settings, relied on the presets, which also delivered consistently good brews. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it excels both for single-serve and for brewing larger batches – a big plus for when guests visit or when you just want to prep for the day ahead.

**Strengths**  
- Incredible build quality with thoughtful design elements, such as the silicone seal to protect your cabinets.  
- Companion app enhances the usage experience with remote scheduling and notifications.  
- Supports single-serve and batch brews without sacrificing flavor consistency.  
- Cold brew setting adds even more versatility.  
  
**Areas for Improvement**  
- The 15.4-pound weight makes it less portable, so you’ll want to find its permanent spot in your kitchen.  
- Filter basket design occasionally drips after use, which can be a bit messy.  
- The matte black finish, though stunning, does smudge easily.  

**Comparing to Rival Brands**  
Before I jumped into getting the Aiden Coffee Maker, I had been using a Technivorm Moccamaster. While the Moccamaster is undeniably solid with its no-frills approach to brewing exceptional coffee, it lacked the digital features and app integration that the Aiden brings to the table. The Aiden also offers more versatility with its customizable profiles and cold brew setting, features the Moccamaster doesn’t include. That said, the Moccamaster arguably wins in sheer simplicity – it’s ideal if you prefer a manual brewing experience without frills. While both excel in quality, the Aiden edges ahead in my book due to its innovative features.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Let’s address the elephant in the room—value. Is the Fellow Aiden Coffee Maker worth the investment? Considering it merges advanced brewing guidance, scheduling, and app functionalities with an elegant, user-friendly design, it feels like a complete package for serious coffee enthusiasts. However, if all you care about is pouring hot water over ground coffee, the price could feel steep. For anyone who values control, convenience, and consistently good coffee, though, the investment feels justified.

Smoothie lovers, get ready to revolutionize your blending game! Have you ever stared at a bowl of granola and wondered if it could transform your morning smoothie from ordinary to extraordinary? The good news is that adding granola to your smoothie isn't just possible – it's a game-changing nutritional hack that can elevate your breakfast or post-workout drink. Whether you're looking to add extra texture, boost nutritional value, or simply experiment with new flavor combinations, granola can be the secret ingredient that takes your smoothie from good to absolutely incredible.

Why Consider Adding Granola to Your Smoothie?

Granola isn't just a topping – it's a nutritional powerhouse that can completely transform your smoothie experience. Here are some compelling reasons to blend this crunchy delight into your favorite drink:

1. Nutritional Boost
• Packed with fiber
• Rich in protein
• Provides essential minerals and vitamins
• Offers complex carbohydrates for sustained energy

2. Texture Enhancement
Adding granola introduces a delightful crunch that breaks up the monotony of traditional smooth smoothies. The contrast between the creamy liquid and crispy granola creates a unique sensory experience that can make your drink more satisfying and enjoyable.

How to Incorporate Granola into Your Smoothie

Blending Techniques for Perfect Smoothie Integration

There are multiple ways to incorporate granola into your smoothie, each offering a slightly different experience:

**Blending Method**
For those who love a completely smooth texture, you can blend the granola directly into the smoothie. This method breaks down the granola completely, integrating its flavors and nutrients throughout the drink. Pro tip: Add the granola last and pulse briefly to maintain some texture.

**Topping Method**
If you prefer a more distinct crunch, sprinkle granola on top of your finished smoothie. This method allows you to enjoy the full texture of the granola while still benefiting from its nutritional profile.

Choosing the Right Granola for Your Smoothie

Not all granolas are created equal. Consider these factors when selecting the perfect granola for your smoothie:

Nutritional Content
• Look for granolas with minimal added sugars
• Choose options with whole grain ingredients
• Consider protein-rich granolas for added nutrition

Flavor Profiles
Different granola flavors can complement various smoothie types:
• Honey-based granolas work well with fruit smoothies
• Nut-based granolas pair nicely with chocolate or coffee smoothies
• Seed-based granolas add nutritional depth to green smoothies

Potential Challenges and Solutions

While adding granola to smoothies is generally simple, you might encounter a few challenges:

**Texture Concerns**
Some people worry about granola becoming soggy. Solution: Add granola just before drinking or use it as a topping to maintain crispness.

**Nutritional Balance**
Be mindful of portion sizes. A small handful (about 1/4 cup) is typically sufficient to add flavor and nutrition without overwhelming the smoothie.

Expert Tips for Smoothie Success

Professional smoothie makers recommend these techniques:
1. Freeze granola briefly before adding to maintain crispness
2. Experiment with different granola types
3. Balance granola's dry nature by adjusting liquid content
4. Consider homemade granola for maximum freshness

Health Considerations

While granola can be incredibly nutritious, it's essential to choose wisely:
• Check sugar content
• Look for whole ingredient lists
• Consider your personal dietary needs
• Moderation is key

The Versatility of Granola in Smoothies

From tropical fruit blends to protein-packed post-workout drinks, granola can enhance virtually any smoothie. Its versatility means you're only limited by your imagination and taste preferences.

1kau3fc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvLiterateRP/comments/1kau3fc/f_playing_a4a_dark_romance_thriller_stories/,"[F playing A4A] Dark romance, thriller stories.","Hello everyone! Thanks for reading my post. My name is Vale and I'm a 23 female roleplayer searching for other 18+ roleplayers willing to lose themselves in a journey full of drama, angst, betrayals and controversial themes.  
I must confess, I'm particularly interested in very dark roleplays at the moment, so give me dramatic, gritty and angsty stories please! For this reason, if you're not comfortable with playing/playing against really morally grey characters (to the point of them being assassins, serial killers and so on), I'm probably not the partner for you.  
I have a couple of plots in mind, and they will be listed down below!  


\***About me and my preferences:***

\- I'm 23, so I won't roleplay with minors. Please do not interact if you're one. Said this, your age doesn't matter to me as long as you are 18+. The main characters must be 18+ as well, although I can accept side characters that break the rule (if they make sense to the story and are not involved in anything sexual, of course).
  
\- I write in 3rd person, past tense. No first person, please. It makes me uncomfortable.- I'm female, but play both female and male characters. My favourite pairings are M×M or M×F, and I unfortunately don't play F×F couples. Your gender in real life or your sexual preferences don't matter to me: all members of the LGBTQ+ community are safe and welcome. I will respect your pronouns and your identity if you're willing to share it on the Internet. If not, that's not an issue either. However, for this roleplay, I would prefer for you to play a cis woman or a cis man.  

\- I consider myself to be advanced literate, and, although English is not my first language, I believe I have a good grasp of its grammar, spelling and punctuation. I'm not searching for one-liners or low effort roleplays, but I cannot handle novella roleplays (600+ words) either, at the moment. I did them in the past, and they become a bit of a chore after a while; I typically write 3/4 paragraphs (around 2000/3000 characters, within the Discord limit, but not scared to break it if the situation calls for it) and would like my partner to match my length. Length that could obviously be adjusted, depending on what's happening in the story or our inspiration.  

\- I'm pretty busy at the moment, so I aim to give my partners a reply every week, but it happens that I need a couple of extra days to organise my ideas and write them down. I really don't care about how long it takes for someone to type out a response, and I hope to find someone who's just as understanding.  

\- For me, roleplaying means collaborative writing. I love brainstorming ideas, discussing plot twists or just talking about our characters. About who they are, why they do what they do, who they could become and how. A bit like writing a book, but with another person. If you have a song that reminds you of our story, fanarts, drawings, reels or whatever, send them to me! I enjoy chatting OOC about what we are writing. This isn't in any way required, though: what I care about is having an enthusiastic partner, who doesn't force me to take the lead every time. Bring your ideas to the table, please! I promise I don't bite.  

\- I love stories that are filled with plot twists, drama, fights. I want our characters to shape who they are through the roleplay, make choices and mistakes, learning from them or not learning at all and doing them all over again. I'm not interested in good, perfect characters. Give me the aggressive, indipendent woman who doesn't give a damn about anyone but herself. Or the grumpy middle aged workaholic who's too hurt to love again. Give me a man who never does bad things—unless someone is not watching. A shy, boring woman who's tired to work infinite hours at the police station, until a serial killer tries to get her attention. I'll say no to characters that need to be pushed around all the time.  

\- NSFW content: YES, but not if that's the point of the story. The focus of this roleplay will be the relationship between our characters, and how events have the power and the ability to change it. It's about their feelings, and how those feelings challenge their beliefs or personality. I'm not here to get anyone off: while I enjoy NSFW themes and believe they give further informations on who the character is, that's not the focus of the story. I should also warn everyone that I absolutely love slow burn romance, and I'm a sucker for building tension over and over again, before getting to the point of releasing it. We will discuss boundaries, triggers and limits in DMs, and I will respect every single one my partner might have, asking them to do the same.  

\- Side characters: BIG YES! I love to create a world around our characters, see them interacting with other people, knowing them through them. I think they add so much to the story, if played well. I will play the necessary side characters, and I would like to have a partner who does the same.  

\***Possible plots:***  

\***[M×M o M×F\] ""An innocent's story""***
\Muse A is a detective in love with their work, with a strong sense of justice and admirable morals. Muse B's criminal record, on the other hand, is far from being clean (up to us what they are guilty about: are they a serial killer? Involved in the mafia? A thief?). Their first meeting is not casual; Muse A is asked to investigate on Muse B's most recent whereabouts, and the detective decides to work on the case undercover to reach their goal. It's an easy case, something they are not worried about. And yet, everything falls apart rather quickly; Muse B is way smarter than what Muse A had anticipated, and far more captivating and charming as well. While setting their own trap, Muse A will risk falling into Muse B's spider web as well— and perhaps find out they like it more than what they'd like to admit. 

\***[M×M o M×F\] ""Clues to my heart""***
\A new serial killer is terrorising Muse A's city, targeting a specific type of victim. Muse A is a troubled detective who recently came back to work after a traumatic experience, under the strict condition of attending therapy and getting more rest.   
Muse B is a young, clever therapist who's slowly gaining Muse A's trust during their weekly sessions while dealing with his own traumatic, unsolved past. The relationship between the two steadily develops both professionally and personally, until boundaries and professional detachment become two confusing concepts: somehow, Muse B seems to casually be in the same places Muse A normally frequents, he acts like a friend more than a therapist, often moves the conversation towards prohibited themes.   
But Muse A is too busy thinking about the cases they have to solve to realise what is happening. Despite what his boss reminds them every day, they cannot rest until the serial killer is behind bars: because they left clues, clues that prove he knows something Muse A wants to keep hidden. Because the killer seems to be flirting with Muse A through their crime scenes in a very familiar way, lightly twisting the knife into wounds only Muse B knows about.   

\***[M×M o M×F\] ""Something's wrong with the new neighbour""***
\A man (Muse B) and a cheerful, bubbly five-year-old girl just moved into the house next to the one Muse A shares with their husband. They recently lost the third member of their family, the girl's mother and Muse B's wife, and decided to change their surroundings to heal away from the big city.   
Muse A conquers the little girl's heart immediately, while slowly making their way into Muse B's one as well. But Muse A's husband is not happy with this new ""friendship"" and, in a few weeks, new bruises appear on the body parts Muse A is not able to cover with clothes and makeup.   
Then, the shocking news: Muse A's husband's body is found in the nearest lake, with no clues on who might be responsible for the tragedy.   
While Muse A tries to adjust to the unreal situation, secrets and confusing informations about Muse B's past quickly become the favourite topic of discussion in the small city: his wife went missing months prior, and yet he insists on saying that she is dead. Someone swears to have seen Muse B talking with Muse A just the night of his death. He acts strangely whenever his wife is mentioned.   
(Bonus point if we make this a M/M story, and Muse B has internalised homophobia/isn't comfortable with his attraction for men at first.)  

\***[M×M o M×F\] ""Deadly tachycardia""*** 
\Two strangers decide to sign up on an online dating app to meet the love of their life. Perhaps out of boredom. A friend's advice. Just because it's easier than having to flirt with someone in a bar, even. Truth to be told, one of them has a very specific reason to be on the app. Muse A never talks about his job, but they were paid to make excellent jokes and appear as charming as possible. To find their way into their date's wounds and stab their heart— quite literally. They are eager to meet Muse B, who, on the other hand, finds every excuse to delay the first meeting.   
One night, surrounded by Muse B's bodyguards, Muse A finally gets to understand why the new mission is going to be so much harder than his previous ones: Muse B is far from being a Miss/Mr Nobody (who they are it's up to us!).  
While they try to conquer Muse B's trust and heart, Muse A will have to deal with his own feelings for someone who hides a dark secret of their own (they hired Muse B themselves? They are trying to destroy Muse B's business? Up for discussion!)  
(Bonus point if Muse B has some kind of cronich illness physical disability because I think it could add a layer of complexity to this particular story!)
  
\***[M×M and M×F, requires you to play two characters!\] ""The Royal swap""***
\Muse A is a princess, second in line for the throne after her twin brother, Muse C. The reign is involved in a bloody, terrifying war with the North, and Muse B's father, the kind of the North, is not willing to let go. With the excuse of creating an alliance between the two kingdoms, Muse A's father, the king of the South, decides to arrange a marriage between her and Muse B (first in line for the throne in the North), despite the girl's protests.   
Here comes Muse C. Knowing his sister is interested in sitting on the throne more than what he'll ever be, he decides to make a plan to follow their father's orders without having to sacrifice anyone's happiness. He cuts Muse A's hair, making very difficult for people to tell the two twins apart, then leaves the country to face the upcoming wedding.   
Muse C will have to face a cruel Prince with a hidden soft heart, who's slowly discovering his own sexuality after years of repression. Meanwhile, Muse B has to train like a man, dress like a man, act like a man, while hiding her feelings for the only person who can tell the difference between her and her brother— Muse D.   
What will happen when Muse A will receive the order to kill his spouse? For how long Muse B and D will manage to keep their true identity and relationship secret?   

\***[M×M o M×F\] Sick person/caretaker (heavily inspired by me before you) ""Let me in""***
\Muse A doesn't tolerate any type of help.   
That's the phrase her mother says, whenever she welcomes a new nurse, doctor, or maid in their ridiculously large house. Something happened in Muse A's past, a terrible accident that left them unable to care for themselves properly (the kind of injury can be discussed, as well as Muse A's abilities/disabilities. She might have a chronic illness, she might be paralysed, or whatever else comes to mind).   
Muse B doesn't really know why he accepted the job to begin with. Truth to be told, their financial situation is not the best (to be kind), and the family promised a large amount of money and regular payment. More importantly, a place to stay when Muse B couldn't even afford rent. They are there to keep Muse A company and help them with daily tasks, they are told, but it's not as easy as it seems: Muse A is rude, mostly annoyed by anything Muse B does or say, to the point of insulting them or ignoring them altogether.   
And yet, one night, something changes.   
But nothing is never how it appears.   
Could Muse B be responsible for the accident that destroyed Muse A's life? Or is Muse A not really sick, after all? 

\***Other dynamics i'd like to explore although I don't have anything specific in mind:*** 

- INMATE X COP/INMATE 

- PRIEST X PROSTITUTE/NUN-PRIEST/ANYONE

* **Writing sample:**

Sitting in the underground, waiting for her stop, Rose thinks New York never looked so boring. It's one of those days, she fears: when the rain makes going anywhere, or talk to anyone, an incredibly tedious task. A homeless man is laying on the bench in front of her own, taking three seats instead of one. He's shivering and sweating at the same time, and it's safe to assume he's struggling with one of those harsh virus she exposes herself to whenever she doesn't feel like driving to work. The man is clinging to the paper cup in his right hand, although there are just few dollars in it. Rose can't stop thinking how a few thousands dollars donation could literally change his life, allowing him to buy medicines and perhaps make himself presentable for a decent job. 2000 dollars would be enough, she considers, with no real intention to actually help the person desperately trying to survive. It's a ridiculous sum of money for someone like her - one she could throw away and not miss in the slightest. And yet, she feels no empathy or pity for his tragedy. 

The doors open. 
A well dressed man limps in holding an heavy suitcase in one hand and his IPhone in the other. He sees the homeless man, and taps his pockets in search of money. Rose sees the wedding ring on his finger before anything else. 
He giggles as he puts a fifty in the paper cup: he's speaking with someone he calls *love* and *darling*, and other pet names the woman on the other line certainly doesn't deserve. His voice is deep. Warm. Like hot tea and honey under the duvet. 
And it happens just like that. Rose is on the other side of that phone now, being called *love*, and *darling*, and whatever else. She likes it. She likes *him*. 

Her prey doesn't see the danger until it's too late. Rose's standing behind him, and takes advantage of the train's rough stop to lose her balance and bump into him. The coffee she's holding *accidentally* falls on his blue shirt, and then falls on the ground. 
""Oh, my God! Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."" She says quickly, putting on the best shocked-embarassed face she can master. ""I'm so - God, I'm so clumsy."" 
The gentleman, *her* gentleman, is too nice to appear bothered or angry. ""Hey, hey, don't worry. It happens. It's nothing. I hated this shirt anyway."" There is a hint of humour in his voice, which Rose doesn't miss. 
She replaces her mask with an apologetic, innocent one. ""Well, that's - ugh."" She rubs her face like the whole thing it's just the last straw after a very long week. ""I can get it cleaned. If you give it to me - I mean, not now, but you could give me your number, and send the shirt, and I'll fix it."" 
He smiles. *An incredibly charming smile.* ""There is no need. Really. You're kind, but we're even. Don't worry."" 
""I insist."" Now she sounds too desperate. She sighs. ""Please. It would make me feel better. Like I did something good this week."" Acting like a victim is not her favourite flirting method, but it works too well on Mr. Gentleman. 
She leaves the metro with his number and a new mission. ",1,1745948657.0,AdvLiterateRP,0,1.0,False

My name is Santiago, a 34-year-old graduate student from Córdoba, Argentina. In December 2023, I received the devastating diagnosis of stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma - an aggressive, terminal stomach cancer that has turned my world upside down.

**My Battle:**

* Current treatment: Palliative immunotherapy + chemotherapy (FOLFOX initially, now ramucirumab+paclitaxel)
* While my insurance covers the core treatment, I'm being crushed by peripheral costs
* Unable to work due to constant pain, extreme fatigue, and debilitating chemo side effects

**The Harsh Reality:**

* I'm surviving on **$500 USD/month** (from a soon-to-end scholarship)
* Dependent on family in an economy where **food prices double every few months**

**Where Your Help Would Go:**

1. **Critical Medications** ($120+/month): Pantoprazole, clonazepam, ondansetron, etc
2. **Skin Rescue** ($80/tube): Special creams for chemo-induced skin damage
3. **Life-Sustaining Nutrition** ($200+/month): Ensure, whey protein, vital supplements
4. **Essential Care** ($15/hour): Increasing need for nurse assistance at home

**How to Help (Respecting My Privacy):**

* **Crypto (Preferred)**: USDT (TRC20) or BTC - completely private (*DM me for wallet info* *to ensure secure transfer*)
* **Western Union**: Details via DM (can receive USD cash)
* **MercadoPago (Argentina only)**: ALIAS: [nadaparanosotros.mp](http://nadaparanosotros.mp)

**Verification Available:**  
I recognize the importance of trust in online requests. While I choose to maintain my medical privacy, I'm willing to provide:

* Redacted pathology reports (showing only diagnosis and date)
* Letter from my oncologist (with sensitive details removed)
* Official hospital billing statements (for treatment-related expenses)

My dignity is all I have left - I appreciate your understanding that some boundaries must remain.

**A Personal Note:**  
Asking for help like this goes against every instinct I have. But when the choice is between pride and being able to afford basic pain relief, the decision becomes painfully clear. Even the cost of a cup of coffee could help ease this unbearable burden.

**Playing Surface Dimensions:** The playing surface typically measures around 48 inches in length and 27 inches in width.

This size offers ample space for competitive foosball matches, accommodating up to four players comfortably. The dimensions are designed to mimic the feel of a standard foosball table while maintaining a compact footprint suitable for living rooms or game rooms. The playing field is often crafted from a smooth, durable laminate material for optimal ball control.

The robust build quality is crucial for withstanding the rigors of intense foosball games. The legs are designed for stability and often feature adjustable levelers to ensure a perfectly even playing surface, even on slightly uneven floors. The materials used are resistant to scratches and wear, maintaining the table's aesthetic appeal over time.

**Integrated Foosball Rods and Players:** Eight steel foosball rods are integrated within the table, each equipped with ergonomic handles for comfortable grip and precise control.

Each rod typically features molded plastic players, arranged in the standard configuration of goalies, defenders, midfielders, and forwards. The rods are designed to rotate smoothly, allowing for fast-paced gameplay and accurate shots. The player figures are often painted with team colors or customizable options.

Long post alert,"Thanks to all the kind souls that are taking the time to read this long post and trying to help me out 🙏🏻 

I have been in three relationships in the past and none have lasted more than 2 weeks. The last one was with a bestfriend of 10 years and it literally destroyed me. 

I picked myself up and got back into dating few months back. Couple of weeks back I matched with a girl on bumble and below are the sequence of events. 

Day 1:
Matched on Bumble. She calls me cute, we exchange a few messages.

Day 2:
She says she’s not looking for hookups, wants a connection. We agree and move to Instagram.

Day 3:
We start talking on IG. She invites me to club with her friends on Thursday, but I said can’t make it. I mention working in a different city amd travel back home everything, but she’s fine with it as she travels there often.

Day 4:
We talk all day. She says I’m sweet, and we connect well. She went out with her family but keeps texting. She escalates the convo and starts talking about sexual fantasies and she even describes how we will make put in the car when we mee. We ended up doscussing past relationships, likes, dislikes, etc., for hours. She tells she feels very comfortable and the convo escalated naturally and she appericiates how we spoke a lot things that allowed to get to know each better. She also mentions that she might send me a cute selfie in the morning.

Day 5:
She sends a picture and says she’s comfortable with me. Wants to exchange numbers and calls after work. Invites me for coffee the next day to check if we vibe and I can join her for the club night if we vibed well. I said I can’t due to my schedule. We talk for two hours over phone, and she texts saying  she’s feeling very happy after the call and ask about me. I said i also feel good.

Day 6:
We move to WhatsApp. Cute selfies every morning. We make plans for when she visits my city. She says she’s falling for me. She ask if I am free for a movie Friday, books the tickets before i even respond. I asked if we can do Sunday, she again books the ticket for Sunday. While Friday was an off for me, I wasnt sure about whatever is happening so I was not very interested.

Day 7:
Asks me to pick her club outfit. Keeps texting and calling all night from the club. She says she can’t believe she’s this attached to me without meeting. After she's back we talk over phone the entire night. I also start getting interested. 
She mentions that its the first time she is doing movie as a first date. I tell her that I may be able to meet her tomorrow (Friday) if she is available but i can confirm only last minute. She says she'll make time if i am ok to meet.

Day 8:
Meet for coffee. Had a good time. Idk if its weird she checks out other girls along with me, though she’s straight. After dropping her off, just in 5 mins she calls, says she had a great time and we end up talking for couple of hours. She says she felt the same level of connect even after meeting. She is all hyped up and wants to visit my city soon. We subtly ask about what is that we are having, and she says there’s no label yet, but she likes me and wants it to be something special and not a situationship. We plan to meet next on Sunday for the movie. She also mentions she's caught cold.

Day 9:
She wants a late-night drive. There is a sudden plan for a girls night. I tell her its fine and we can meet directly on Sunday. But she says that she has been thinking of meeting me the entire day and asks me to pick her up directly from her friend's place. 
We meet, have dessert, and a long makeout session in the car.

Day 10:
We go to the movie. She’s sick, so I drop her home, says  bye with a nice long kiss. She call me again over phone in sometime, we talk for a while and she goes to sleep. She also mentions next week is going to be very hectic

Day 11:
She’s calls me in the morning to tell she is off work for two days to rest, hoping to see me before I leave. She opens up about her health issues which she earlier told she wasnt ready to sharing until she is fully comfortable . 

Later in the evening, she says family matters are stressing her out, and she might delay visiting me but still wants to. She then goes on say if i am not on the same page then she can understand. I told her she can take her time and the first thing she has to look after now is her health and family. We didnt talk much after this. Here is where i started understanding something is off.

Day 12:
She doesn’t text until I reach out. Says she’s been busy with work. I texted her to see if we can talk, she says she is sleeping with her parents and cannot talk. Gives a short missed call at 11:30 PM, rants about issues between her parents and how it feels so draining to go back home to it for some 40mins. 

Day 13:
I don’t text first, sensing she’s pulling away. I misdial her, and she texts back, saying she was in a meeting. Later, she asks why I didn’t remind her to eat or drink. I say I thought she was busy. She said she will text once she is free but didnt. 

Day 14:
She texts in the morning, no usual picture. When I asked says she’s sick and didn’t have time or mood. I tell her I’m leaving, and she says she had a great time the three days we met, but can’t meet. I asked her not to stress. I tell her I sense a lack of interest, and she says she is trying to figure out many things. She genuinely want to be there and is trying hard but her mind isn't letting her to. 

Day 15:
No texts all day. I knew where this was going and i also didnt text her. I lose my control and call her at night, she doesnt pick and texts she’s busy with work. I asked her to call when free.

Day 16:
Dumps me with this text :

"" I've been wanting to talk to you about something. I'm dealing with a lot of things right now, one after the other. My parents are talking about unofficial seperation and all, works hectic, and mentally and emotionally I think I'm just not available. I'm sorry if I led you on in any way up until now.
This doesn't mean I don't want to stay in touch with you, if you're okay to be just friends for now, I'd be more than happy to. But for now, I don't think I'm okay to be emotionally available.
If you don't want to continue to stay in touch I understand that as well
Sorry if I've upset you first thing in the morning. But I don't want to keep you in the dark for a second also, we developed a bond and I want to respect that. ""

I replied ""Thanks for letting me know. Stay strong and I hope you'll come out of whatever you are going through. I'm here if you need something""

She replied ""Thank you and I'm really sorry.""  and we didnt talk after that

TL;DR : I matched with a girl on bumble. We hit it off well and she seemed to very interested. Things quickly escalted but just after two she decides to dump me stating jer parents are talking about unofficial seperation and she is emotionally unavailable right now.

I am not able to process what just happened. I have these questions running on mind :
1. Was this genuine or i just got played?
2. If it was genuine, what could have been so bad that suddenly everything changed?
3. Should i reach out to her to understand the actual reason behind it?
4. Am i at the wrong since i have never been in a relationship more than couple of weeks? (Although technically this wasnt a relationship)

Chapter 1  
  
I had just seen those boxers two days ago while packing his suitcase for a business trip.  
  
When Fabian noticed me eyeing the letter, he asked with a casual smile, ""What's up?""  
  
I shook my head. ""Nothing.Just noticed the monogram—pretty unique. Never seen anything like it before.""  
  
Fabian raised an eyebrow, explaining smoothly, ""My skin's sensitive to most fabrics. I get all my underwear custom-made.""  
  
At the time, I didn't think twice about it.  
  
Now, this post was sending my mind into a spiral of doubt.  
  
The poster kept digging herself deeper in the comments  
  
""Everyone needs to chill the hell out.""  
  
""He's still single technically, and we haven't hooked up or anything, so how is this cheating?""  
  
""Someone asked if I mark his new underwear too. Duh! He ships every new pair to me first.""  
  
""Does his girlfriend know? God no.""  
  
""We're super careful. Nobody has a clue.""  
  
""Haha I've been doing this since I was fourteen, FYI.""  
  
""Relax, I'm deleting this post soon anyway.""  
  
The thread was blowing up with strangers calling her out.I didn't join in, but I couldn't shake the creeping suspicion.  
  
Then I caught myself—was I seriously going to question my fiancé because of some random internet stranger? Get a grip!  
  
The poster's location showed London, for crying out loud.  
  
Everyone in our social circle knows Fabian has always been Mr. Perfect—never have a scandal. He's a person who buttons his shirt all the way to the top..  
  
When someone once asked why he was so proper, he just said, ""Quality over quantity.""  
  
After graduating from Wharton, Fabian launch his company.  
  
His leadership team is 50/50 men and women, with female employees making up the majority overall.  
  
The benefits are insane comprehensive healthcare, flexible hours and sick days, six months of parental leave for all genders, and actual vacation time people can take without guilt.  
  
He even created the OWL initiative ""Oracle Women's Leadership"" specifically designed for advancing women.  
  
His executive assistant, Zoe, just had her second baby. When I stopped by his office, she brought me coffee.  
  
""We always wondered what kind of woman would end up with Fabian,"" she said. ""Meeting you, I get it now.""  
  
She got emotional talking about him.  
  
""A man like Fabian has women swooning over him constantly, but I've worked for him for years and never once seen him even flirt back.""  
  
She probably thought I was checking up on him.  
  
Then she opened up about her marriages.  
  
""If Fabian hadn't gotten his legal team to help with my custody battle, my ex would have destroyed me. I never would have met my current husband or had my baby.""  
  
""Fabian's the real deal. You could visit his company if you have time.""  
  
I nodded, sipping my coffee without commenting.  
  
My dad always said there are four ways to judge a man  
  
First, how he handles responsibility—does he step up or make excuses?  
  
Second, how he acts when things go wrong—watch out for the ones who never show frustration.  
  
Third, his friends—sometimes, men hang out with jerks, but they don’t do it often..  
  
Fourth, his family—how his parents treated each other is his blueprint for relationships.

1katxqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1katxqq/how_much_can_you_really_plan/,How much can you really plan?,"So I have a mobile coffee cart at the moment but I'm planning into venturing into something else since I don't really want to scale it since I feel that it's too much work for too little return.

RN I'm thinking about how much you can really plan beforehand and how to approach it.

My first thought is that there are tens of thousands owner owned and operated pizza shops where they work 12hrs/day (A). Then there are tens of thousands which have couple of employees so the owner doesn't have to be there all day long (B). Then there is papa johns (C). Sure not everyone would be able to establish a papa johns but I think that hiring few people is doable for a lot of places. But many seem stuck and I don't think that it's a natural progression from A to B to C, people can get stuck at any level and I think it's their decision at the end of the day (due to lack of knowledge, vision....).

So it's important to have a realistic goal in mind and plan the type of business beforehand (say you want B so you approach it as B). (my coffee cart is at A rn hehe, but I also study so I'm not working fulltime)

My second thought is that there are many many business opportunities which you can't even fathom since they are so much out your scope. For example I've read lately about a DIY beekeeping set for your backyard. Like I wouldn't even think about that since I never had anything to do with bees. But still how much can you try to find something outside of your scope? Do people really do it?

Third for a coffee cart is fairly easy to calculate costs. I tried to find out how much revenue is possible, I sat around for an hour behind my competitor and counted how much cups they sold. So I had a rough estimate. But still extrapolating it for a whole month is kinda impossible since I do events only and don't really know if I can fill all my weekends or none for that month. Sometimes you have a shit day and you don't earn anything and there there are good days,....

But that kind of stuff gets more complicated if your business model is more complicated. Sure for someone like a freelancer or a tradie I'd know how to calculate it but I don't even know how much you can plan beforehand for something like the DIY set. Sure you know the costs beforehand but you never ever will know how much units you'll be able to sell.

Also even more complicated is a company I did an internship with, they do specialized POS systems and cash management systems and I wouldn't even know at all how to approach that, since the revenue seems to be detached from costs (it's not like 10 tradies each 100 billable hrs/month for example).

I neither want to be a fool trying to overthink it and I don't want to be a fool not trying to think through it.

So I don't have an exact question but that's been on my mind lately how much one can really plan beforehand and what are your thoughts on that?",1,1745948268.0,smallbusiness,2,1.0,False

Drop a comment and I’ll share the link**

In the third year of her marriage, her husband Alex Stone died on a mission.  
  
His twin brother, Jude Stone, returned with a bloodstained badge, his voice cracking as he said, ""Charlotte, Alex is... he's not coming back.""  
  
In extreme grief, she fainted on the spot.  
  
In the following months, she tried various suicide methods - taking sleeping pills, cutting her wrist, jumping into the river... but was saved every time.  
  
Everyone around is exclaiming, ""Mr. Stone and his wife were so devoted to each other...""  
  
Yes, they were.  
  
So devoted that it took her three months after his ""death"" to discover the truth—the man who died WASN'T her husband at all.  
  
...  
  
On the night when the third suicide attempt was saved, Charlotte dragged herself to her mother-in-law's house with a face pale as death, hoping to find some of Alex's old belongings to comfort her longing. But the conversation from inside the room chilled her to the bone.  
  
""Alex, how much longer are you going to keep up this charade? Charlotte has tried to kill herself three times for you!""  
  
Her fingers dug painfully into her palms.  
  
Alex? Why was her mother-in-law calling Jude by her husband's name?  
  
""Mom, just... give it time.."" The voice belonged to Jude, but the tender tone was more like Alex's—the gentleness he used when comforting her.  
  
""Jude made me promise with his dying breath to look after Violet. You know how fragile she is—hearing about Jude's death would definitely destroy her. So I had to step into my brother's shoes, to give her a child, something for her to live for.""  
  
Charlotte's blood turned to ice. She could hardly believe what she was hearing.  
  
So it was Alex's twin brother Jude who had died, not Alex.  
  
Her husband was still alive, but he was masquerading as his brother, sleeping in the next room—with his brother's wife!  
  
""But what about Charlotte?"" Her mother-in-law's voice grew more urgent. ""You're sharing Violet's bed without a second thought for your own wife?""  
  
""She's stronger than Violet...""  
  
The words hit like a knife to the ribs. Charlotte stumbled back, knocking over a broom.  
  
The room fell silent.  
  
Charlotte turned and ran as if pursued by demons.  
  
As she fled, she felt a sharp pain in her hand. Opening her palm, she discovered that she'd been clutching Alex's badge so tightly it had cut into her skin, blood trickling down her wrist.  
  
For three months, she'd slept with this badge pressed to her chest, waking up countless times with tears streaming down her face.  
  
Now? It was a goddamn joke.  
  
Her husband wasn't dead at all.  
  
He just chose to let her believe he was—all for the sake of his ""fragile"" sister-in-law!  
  
Five years earlier, Charlotte had met Alex at a military gala.  
  
He was the hard-as-nails Captain; she was a dancer with the Army Entertainment Corps.  
  
They both had their share of admirers, but that night, he stood at the foot of the stage, watching her dance with burning intensity. When she finished, he'd vaulted onto the stage and draped his dress coat over her bare shoulders.  
  
""Charlotte,"" he'd murmured, fingers brushing her collarbone. ""Take care of yourself. You'll catch cold.""  
  
Wrapped in his coat and his attention, she blushed with shyness.  
  
After that, he began pursuing her, always making a detour to see her before each mission.  
  
The day she agreed to be his girlfriend, he got spectacularly drunk and spun her around in circles in the courtyard, proclaiming, ""Charlotte, you're the only one for me. Forever.""  
  
After they married, everyone said Captain Stone adored his wife to the bone.  
  
She had believed he loved her more than life itself.  
  
But now?  
  
Now he was ""taking care"" of his brother's wife by pretending to be Jude, sharing Violet's bed, even planning to get her pregnant.  
  
And her? Like a fool, had cried for him, tried to die for him, suffered unbearable pain for him.  
  
Had he ever considered that she might be hurting too?  
  
When she made it home in a daze, Mrs. Wilson, the local matchmaker, was waiting for her again.  
  
""Charlotte, honey, Commander Hayes is being deployed to the island base in two weeks. This is the seventh time he's asked me to talk to you... He says if you don't agree this time, he's never coming back.""  
  
Ryan Hayes, Alex's fellow officer.  
  
Since the day she'd been declared a ""widow,"" he had repeatedly asked for her hand in marriage.  
  
She had refused him six times.  
  
Because she believed she would only ever love one man: Alex.  
  
But now...  
  
She looked up, her voice eerily calm. ""All right. I'll marry him.""  
  
Mrs. Wilson was stunned. ""You're... serious?""  
  
""Absolutely."" She managed a smile. ""Please tell Ryan that I'll marry him in two weeks and follow him to the island base.""  
  
The door slammed open. Alex—no, Jude now—loomed in the doorway, his face thunderous.   
  
""Charlotte. Who are you marrying?""  
  
Charlotte looked at him, finding the whole situation absurdly ironic.  
  
""Jude,"" she said softly, ""this is my business.""  
  
He gripped Charlotte's wrist with painful force. ""Charlotte has me to look after her. She doesn't need to remarry. Besides, she loved my brother too much to ever consider another man. Mrs. Wilson, please don't come here again. Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless!""  
  
Mrs. Wilson looked bewildered. ""But Charlotte already agreed—""  
  
Before she could finish, Charlotte tugged at her arm. ""Mrs. Wilson, didn't you say you needed to get to the store? You'd better hurry before it closes.""  
  
The distraction worked. Mrs. Wilson nodded and quickly left.  
  
Seeing her go, Alex visibly relaxed. He stepped closer, his Adam's apple bobbing. ""Charlotte, I know Alex is gone, but I promise I'll take care of you. The next time Mrs. Wilson come knocking, just send her away...""  
  
Heard of that, Charlotte only felt ridiculous.  
  
He spent his nights in Violet's bed but couldn't bear the thought of her remarriage? What kind of twisted logic was that?  
  
But she didn't expose him. She simply nodded.  
  
Anyway, in two weeks, she would marry Ryan and leave this place forever. Then Alex wouldn't be able to control her anymore.  
  
That night, as Charlotte was packing her belongings, she heard the unmistakable creaking of a bed from the adjacent room.  
  
Before, when she'd heard such sounds, she had simply assumed Jude and his wife had a healthy relationship.  
  
Now, each moan was like a blunt knife tearing at her flesh.  
  
That was unmistakably Alex's deep groan—the same sound he used to make in her ear when they made love.  
  
""Ahhh!""  
  
A scream pierced the night. Charlotte rushed out to see Alex carrying a half-dressed Violet toward the door, the alarming red stain in Violet's white pajama pants was unmistakable.  
  
The military housing complex instantly erupted with concerned neighbors. Mrs. Lee poked her head out from next door.  
  
""My goodness, what happened?""  
  
""I heard they were too rough during a sex and she even started bleeding...""  
  
""Tsk, tsk, tsk... Jude always seemed so serious, who knew he was so wild on the bed...""  
  
Standing amidst the crowd, Charlotte felt a chill spread through her body.  
  
She turned to leave, but Mrs. Lee grabbed her arm. ""Charlotte, you're family! You should go with them to the hospital!""  
  
To avoid gossip, she had no choice but to throw on a coat and follow them to the emergency room.  
  
In the hospital corridor, the sharp smell of antiseptic made Charlotte's eyes sting.  
  
Alex paced anxiously, clearly startled when he saw her.  
  
""What are you doing here?""  
  
Charlotte forced a smile. ""As your family, I should be here.""  
  
Suddenly, the operating room doors swung open, and the doctor emerged.  
  
""Don't worry, sir. Your wife is fine—she's pregnant. You'll just need to be more careful with intimacy...""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Charlotte stood in the hospital corridor as the doctor's words sent static buzzing through her head.  
  
""She's pregnant."" The news hit her like a sucker punch to the gut.  
  
Instinctively, she glanced at Alex, watching as his initial shock transformed into raw, unbridled joy, his voice dropping to a whisper: ""Thank God... everything's finally going to get back on track.""  
  
She knew exactly what he meant. Violet was pregnant. Now he could finally ditch his ""Jude"" charade and crawl back to her.  
  
But she has already no longer wanted him.  
  
""The patient's pretty anemic, though. She's going to need a blood transfusion,"" the doctor added, cutting through Charlotte's thoughts.  
  
Alex immediately rolled up his sleeve, but the doctor stopped him: ""Sorry, your blood type isn't compatible. We need Type B.""  
  
Charlotte happened to be Type B.  
  
His gaze turned to her, hesitating before he stepped closer. ""Charlotte, Violet's pregnant. This baby... we've been hoping for this.""  
  
He paused. ""Could you donate some blood for her? Once the baby is born, I will definitely make it up to you.""  
  
Make it up? Charlotte laughed bitterly inside.  
  
Was his idea of fixing things just waltzing back into her life like he was doing her some grand favor?  
  
""I'll donate the blood,"" she said evenly. ""But don't worry about make it up to me.""  
  
She turned and followed the nurse to the donation area.  
  
As the needle pierced her vein, she watched her bright red blood flow into the collection bag, suddenly remembering their first year of marriage when she'd come down with a brutal fever. Alex had carried her on his back for kilomiles to reach the hospital.  
  
That day, with a similar needle in her arm, he had gripped her hand tightly. ""Don't be scared, babe. I'm right here.""  
  
Now her blood would flow into another woman's body, nourishing their child.  
  
The weakness after the blood draw forced Charlotte to stay at home and recuperate for the next few days.  
  
Half lying on the bed, through her window, she watched Alex—he wasn't even reporting to base anymore—carrying a thermos back and forth between their house and the hospital every day.  
  
Chicken soup today, some special eggs tomorrow...  
  
Once upon a time, when she was bedridden with the flu, he'd creating different recipes to help her recover as well.  
  
Few days later, Violet was discharged, the entire military housing complex was filled with the sweet scent of caramel candies.  
  
Alex carried a jar of celebratory candy, distributing them door-to-door, his typically stern features softened by an undisguisable smile: ""Violet's pregnant. Let's share the joy. Have some candy.""  
  
""Congrats, man!""  
  
""Finally, the baby you've been waiting for!""  
  
He smiled and nodded, his entire face radiating the joy of impending fatherhood.  
  
Finally, he approached Charlotte, his hand hesitating as he offered her a candy. ""Charlotte...""  
  
""Congratulations,"" she took the candy, her smile perfectly calibrated. ""I wish your little family all the happiness in the world.""  
  
Alex's brow furrowed almost imperceptibly.  
  
Her wishes were too perfect, too composed—composed enough to make his heart race with anxiety.  
  
Since ""Alex's death,"" Charlotte had been either sobbing or raging. When had she ever been this calm?  
  
Before he could dwell on it, Violet came over and linked her arm through his, her voice sugary sweet: ""Jude, didn't you say we'd take Charlotte out for dinner?""  
  
To thank Charlotte for the blood donation, Violet insisted on treating her to a meal.  
  
Despite her repeated refusals, Charlotte finally found herself in their car.  
  
At the restaurant, a waitress greeted them enthusiastically: ""Table for three? Right this way!""  
  
Her gaze moved between Alex and Violet, and she smiled. ""You two make such a cute couple!""  
  
Then she looked at Charlotte: ""Is this your sister? She's gorgeous.""  
  
Alex froze, but before he could respond, Charlotte had already answered pleasantly: ""Yes, I'm his sister.""  
  
Those words stabbed him like a knife to the heart.  
  
But looking at Violet's slightly swollen belly, he couldn't bring himself to correct her.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
When ordering, Alex rattled off a list of dishes with practiced ease: ""No cilantro, light on oil and salt, extra spicy with a touch of sour...""  
  
All Violet's preferences.  
  
It wasn't until the waitress asked, ""And what would your sister like?"" that he seemed to remember Charlotte's presence, turning toward her with a startled expression.  
  
""I'm fine with anything,"" she said, lowering her face to sip her coffee, the steam clouding her features.  
  
After the food arrived, Charlotte mechanically ate the dishes.  
  
Then her throat suddenly tightened. She realized with horror that the pudding contained almond—  
  
She was allergic to almond!  
  
Once upon a time, Alex had memorized all her dietary restrictions. He would even specifically remind the cafeteria staff not to include almond in her meals.  
  
Now he had ordered pudding topped with almond without a second thought.  
  
""Charlotte?"" Violet noticed her changing complexion. ""Are you okay?""  
  
Alex finally looked up, and seeing her reddening face, jumped to his feet: ""Did you eat almond?!""  
  
Breathing became increasingly difficult. Charlotte's vision began to darken.  
  
Through the haze, she saw Alex rushing toward her, only to be stopped midway by Violet's cry of pain: ""Ah... my stomach hurts so much...""  
  
Time seemed to freeze in that moment.  
  
She watched Alex standing paralyzed, his gaze torn between her and Violet.  
  
Finally, he scooped Violet into his arms, hastily instructing the waitress as he left: ""Please get my sister to a hospital!""  
  
""Miss? Miss!"" The waitress's panicked calls grew fainter.  
  
And then Charlotte's consciousness slipped away completely.  
  
The sharp smell of antiseptic stung Charlotte's eyes as she opened them.  
  
She saw a nurse changing her IV bag.  
  
""You're awake!"" The nurse sighed with relief. ""Lucky the restaurant staff got you here in time. Anaphylactic shock can be deadly.""  
  
Charlotte tried to speak but found her throat burning with pain.  
  
The image of Alex unhesitatingly carrying Violet away refused to leave her mind.  
  
She closed her eyes, but tears still escaped, sliding from the corners of her eyes into her hair.  
  
For three days in the hospital, Charlotte lay alone in her bed. The allergic rash made her whole body itch, and her throat was so swollen she could barely swallow water.  
  
At her lowest point, she overheard nurses whispering outside her door:  
  
""That pregnant woman in 308 is just having some extra movement. Her husband's acting like it's the end of the world.""  
  
""Nothing like the patient in 302. Such a severe allergic reaction, and not once has her husband come to check on her. It's like he's already dead...""  
  
Charlotte buried her face in her pillow.  
  
Her husband was indeed already 'dead'.  
  
Dead in that mission, dead three months ago, dead... the moment he chose to become someone else's husband.  
  
On the day of her discharge, the sun was shining brightly.  
  
Charlotte had just reached the hospital entrance when she spotted the familiar olive-green Jeep.  
  
A moment later, Violet emerged from the hospital doors.  
  
The car door flew open with a bang, and Alex rushed over in a few quick strides, carefully supporting Violet's waist: ""Take it easy. The doctor said you need plenty of rest...""  
  
His voice was dripping with tenderness, exactly the same way he used to comfort her.  
  
Charlotte stood frozen in place, watching the Jeep drive away, its exhaust fumes blowing onto her pale face.  
  
He hadn't even spared her a single glance.  
  
Charlotte walked for so long that it was almost dark when she finally got home.

""Charlotte,"" he stepped quickly toward her. ""How's your allergy? Any better?""  
  
How ironic.  
  
Ignoring her completely during the day, then showing up alone to play the caring role.  
  
""Thanks for your concern. I'm much better,"" she said, trying to move past him.  
  
Alex grabbed her wrist: ""Take these to help you recover...""  
  
""No need—""  
  
""Jude! Holy shit—we're screwed!"" Violet suddenly burst into the yard, tears streaking her face. ""I've been reported for selling fake green cards to immigrants!""

1katwny,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1katwny/old_mcdonald_creepypasta/,OLD McDONALD (creepypasta),"I’m sure many of you have been to a newly remodeled McDonald’s. Possibly more notably a Forever Young one,

But have you ever looked up why they started remodeling the restaurants in the first place?

The first Forever Young designed store in the world popped up in Oak Brook, IL near their corporate headquarters back in June of 2005, That one is no longer there or in operation as the corporate headquarters have been relocated to downtown Chicago. That was just the beginning, however

Now over the last 19-20 years, McDonald’s has taken to remodeling or rebuilding almost every single restaurant in America. Most of you might even be asking yourself how long it’s been since you last stepped foot in an old McDonald’s, especially one that was built in the 70's or the 80's

Ask anyone who’s done some market research and you’ll hear something strange. McDonald’s loses money on the process. It’s a fact. The new furniture isn’t pulling new customers and the McCafe’s can’t sell coffee and bakery pastries that cheap, that expensive and turn a profit. Look at pricing of Dunkin, Starbucks and Tim Hortons locations and you’ll see what I mean.

Stakeholders say they wanted a more adult vibe for the restaurant. “A classier look for a classier America.”

Wrong answer. Google it right now: what’s McDonald’s target age group? It’s children and teens. It always has been since Ronald McDonald, their clown mascot, was created.

So then why did they start all these remodels? Why would one of the largest corporations in America spend over 1$ grand on a terrible marketing strategy?  
That’s where things get interesting.

Let’s start with the play places.

If you can remember, almost no two play places at McDonald’s were identical. Some of them were really fun. I know I had a few favorites.

That’s where things get interesting.

Let’s start with the play places.

Advertisements

If you can remember, almost no two play places at McDonald’s were identical. Some of them were really fun. I know I had a few favorites.

Well some of them were also really dangerous. The first gem I could find was a carousel play place in Aina Haina, Hawaii (the first one in Hawaii) back in the early 80’s that got shut down and taken out mere a decade after opening in the mid-90s. Little information was given about why they closed and removed the original play area. That one had been replaced by a more safer play place that has since had been removed with the restaraunt's rebuild in early 2010's.

If you find the right journalists in Hawaii though, you just might be able to read an article that didn’t make it to print.

Children would play on the merry-go-round in ways they weren’t supposed to, you see. They’re kids, so of course they would. Well one day a few kids managed to crawl underneath the thing but then they never made it back out.

The whole incident was so heavily guarded by McDonald’s PR, you’d be troubled to find a single person that was even there that whole afternoon. The only witness anyone could find had this to say:

“When they went under, a few parents started calling for help. Then something happened to the lights. The carousel kept getting brighter and the music was deafening. I ran out of the building when the machine started to smoke, but I looked back through the window to see if the kids were alright and the employees were just standing there behind the registers! They looked like they were still waiting for customers!”

Weirder and weirder stories pick up from there through the years. Reports of children sinking into ball pits that should only be a foot deep. Mothers searching play tubes for their kids, only to find a lonely pair of shoes.

But the play places held a mere fraction of the incidents.

Back in 1994 in Squamish, British Columbia, there was a business man of his 40’s who went into a McDonald’s restroom and remained there for seven hours. Patrons and employees noted that he refused to leave the furthest back stall.

The police were finally called and they managed to break down the door. He was restrained by paramedics as he wouldn’t willingly leave the restroom.

As they pulled him out of the stall he began screaming bloody murder “take me back! I want to go back!” but the moment he exited the restaurant he passed out. He had no memory of ever going to a McDonald’s the day of the incident.

The restaurant was shut down by police temporarily and was cordoned off as a crime scene before anyone could inspect the stall he had shut himself in before re-opening for business. However, anyone who used the restroom that day and following mentioned hearing several voices whispering things like:

“It wasn’t him.”

“We have to go back.”

“Saw you smile.”

Then there was a mysterious fry cook of his late 20's-early 30's at a McDonald's in Lewiston, NY, housed inside the historic Frontier House back in 1996 who mysteriously appeared out of nowhere from and went down the stairs from the 3rd floor where they would get the supplies from and walked onto the front counter and dumped scalding oil on himself without flinching or saying a word. Several of the customers started to laugh and roll around in the burning oil alongside him and all were rushed to the hospital. All but one had not recovered and passed but that survivor refuses to make a statement. Not that she easily could. Her throat melted all the way through and had to be completely restructured.

The manager claimed he didn’t remember ever hiring the fry cook and that he wasn’t in any official paperwork or crewboards. “His name tag didn’t even have a name, just #### written on it.” he said, Eventually, in the later half of the early 2000's, the McDonald’s was closed and vacated for good.

Most of the stories sounded like urban legends to me but it never failed. Wherever I found a story, a McDonald’s had been shut down in its wake.

Near the end of the mid 2000's the number of cover ups had become so frequent that McDonald’s decided to either renovate, rebuild their stores or close them outright and sold to new developers. Every. Single. One.

But of course they’d miss a few.

I needed to see one for myself. I remember going in the old McDonald’s as a kid but that was before the frequency of the incidents. That was when it was still safe.

There was a small town on the way to my parents’ house just off the highway. Zimbabwe (not to be confused with the country) was its name. Maybe a hundred residents. Completely untouched by the outside world, practically forgotten. It was pointless to stop there for any normal reason because there wasn’t a rest stop. Not even a sign to let you know you were close.

Let’s just say I had to sneak my way around some very old building permits to discover that they had one of the few McDonald’s (aside from some treasured landmarks) that has yet to go through a rebuild since the 1960’s and a remodel since the 1970's/1980's. How lucky is that? I was surprised they even had an international fast food place, yet they didn’t have anything else familiar such as a small gas station, supermarket and a post office and a few local chains,.

I had planned a trip to my parents’ place for the weekend before, and now i had planned it with a stop at Zimbabwe on the way. It was already dark out since it was the dead of winter and I didn’t get off work ‘till 5. I was cold and grumpy about driving at night, but mostly determined.

Advertisements

I don’t think I would’ve ever found the place before phone GPS, the turn off from the highway was just a dirt road with no landmarks or anything. As I pulled into town none of the houses had lights on. Most of the street lights were out as well, as though nobody had remembered to change the bulbs in years. This place really was untouched. I’d be surprised if most of the residents hadn’t moved out or simply died off. It definitely had the makings of a ghost town anyway.

I was about to lose hope when I finally saw it. The nauseous yellow light of those golden arches illuminating a vacant parking lot in the distance. It buzzed and flickered like a fly zapper running out of batteries, However something was wrong, below the McDonald's text, it said ""OVER 80 BILLION SERVED"", instead of the standard ""OVER 99 BILLION SERVED"" or the standard ""BILLIONS AND BILLIONS SERVED"" The advertising sign below said “eat new mc-riddle sam-iches. We like to saw you smile.” Which I assumed was just the hand- work of a lazy or stupid teen who worked there. I pulled into the lot and carelessly parked my car in the center (there was nobody else there anyway).

When I stepped out of my car, I felt a squish under my foot. There was a burger covered in mold with a rancid liquid oozing out. The smell was absolutely vomit worthy. I jumped out to scrape the contents of the burger from my shoe when I noticed the whole parking lot was covered in trash. There were half eaten boxes of fries and sun baked children’s toys spilling out of old greased up McDonald’s bags, likely from the late 90's-early 2000's. Everything was mixed in with the dirt and snow like it had been here for months, possibly years.

I hurried across the lot to avoid retching all over the asphalt. As I approached the door I noticed the windows were caked in dust. Somebody had taped a piece of paper to the door with the word “CLOSED” scribbled across it in red marker, yet the sign hung from the inside clearly said open, Strangely enough, another one was there, but it said ""LEAVE NOW! IT'S NOT SAFE HERE AT ALL ANYMORE!, HE WILL TAKE YOU ALIIIIIIVE, SAVE YOURSELVES FROM HIM!"", Which felt bone-chilling, Who were they referring to by ""him""? Cautiously I approached the door and pushed.

An artificial bell hummed an old McDonald’s tune that fizzled out on the last few notes as the door creaked open. I looked around the fluorescent lit room and saw it was void of life. There was nobody sitting at any of the tables and nobody attending the registers. Somebody had left a tray and a few cups including a happy meal one on one of the tables in the back but there was no other sign someone had been here.

The inside was at least a little cleaner. The toys on display by the counter were of characters I’d remembered from my childhood, such as Sonic, Kirby, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and many more, likely from the early 2000's. The whole place's walls was covered in faded coats of white and blue paint and all the tables and chair cushions had that classic McDonald’s color scheme of pink, green and blue with geometric shapes from the 90's, finished with trimming of wood. The wood looked completely rotten, but slathered in coats of polish as a sad attempt to keep it looking new. All of it had a sort of green hue which I contributed to the old lights. The most noticeable element, though, was a terrible burning plastic smell that stung my nose.

I went up to the register. I felt like I shouldn’t order anything but I was hoping maybe I could ask someone a few questions, The counter menu was stripped completely of it's prices, and the drive-thru windows had been severely smashed out, and boarded-over to cover it up.

I waited for a good 15 minutes in silence. I shouted hello with only a muted echo for a response. I had been to a few McDonald’s with bad service in the past but this was insane. With how dirty the whole place was I should’ve expected as much.

Just as I was about to turn around and give up, the cash register popped open. It was practically begging me to take a tip for myself. Besides, didn’t I deserve a slight reward for wasting my time here? I casually walked over to it and saw at least a dozen 20’s stacked high.

Looking around to make sure nobody was watching, I reached in to take a few bills when the thing suddenly snapped closed right on my fingers. The metal dug deep into my flesh leaving a dark trail of blood down the side of the counter. I yelped in pain.

Behind the counter at the other end of the grill was a first aid kit hanging on the wall. The lights were burned out in the kitchen area but I needed a bandage, pronto. I hopped over the table and made my way to the back. The burning smell was getting stronger as I walked. I noticed the grill was covered in a thick layer of grease, completely unsuitable for cooking. I passed by the frying station and the oil was filled to the top with maggots that kept increasing number to the point many and many were spilling out and scattering onto the floor.

I quickened my walk to the first aid hoping to get patched up and out of there as soon as possible. I was starting to realize that this restaurant definitely wasn’t open for business anymore and I probably shouldn’t have entered it in the first place. I opened up the first aid kit and had to swallow some vomit.

A cloud of mold burst out from it in every direction followed by the same bubbling black ooze that was on the burger outside. I started coughing and waving my hands in the air to clear the mold dust floating around.

The same bell I heard playing that McDonald’s tune started up again as I steadied myself. I assumed it was broken like the rest of this dump. I looked back toward the counter and noticed everything seemed farther away. I must have been disoriented from losing blood and that awful smell. I looked down at my hand to see how bad the wound was and my eyes widened. There was no wound on my hand at all.

I rushed back towards the counter in a panic when something under the stove caught my foot and I fell. In the darkness my eyes started to adjust and I saw the outline of a body. Somebody was under there. Maybe they were unconscious and needed help! I yanked at the person’s arm and a half decayed body slid out across the floor.

Advertisements

They were wearing a McDonalds’ employee shirt with a name-tag that read ####. Their mouth was contorted into a sickening grin but their eyes were screaming. I tried to shout but no sound came out like when trying to wake up from a nightmare. As I scrambled to get back up to the counter, the lights had started to dim and the McDonald’s tune was getting louder, the notes fizzling and distorting as they played.

Once I had gotten my grip above the counter, I froze.

Since entering, I never looked at the side of the restaurant opposite the counter. There was a play place.

The glass separating the main restaurant from the play area had hundreds of bloody hand-prints smearing down toward the floor. The tube slide was caved in with chunks of red liquid spurting out from the tiny hole left at the bottom. There was a row of nooses tied to the monkey bars in the corner with deceased employees wearing the same #### name-tags hanging from them. The tables around the perimeter had skeletons with rotting food left on trays, some of the food hanging from the skulls’ mouths, which the skulls had holes in evidencing a mass shooting must have took place here. I looked on in horror, too shocked to move.

While the rest of the restaurant went dark, a bulb in the center of the play place continued to glow like a carnival spotlight. Below it was a massive ball pit, barely able to contain all of its colored plastic balls. It was smoking under the blaring white light, making that awful burning plastic smell.

The balls began to rattle and fall off the edge when something inside started shuffling around. I wanted to run so badly but my body refused. Then suddenly the music went dead and the movement stopped.

A yellow glove slowly crept upward from the pit below, writhing its fingers as it went. A connected red and white sleeve came after it, slowly alternating colors as they appeared from underneath. The arm continued to reach toward the sky, growing more and more, while its joints popped and cracked like breaking branches. By the end that arm had to be at least six feet long.

It finally reached for the lit bulb on the ceiling with its gangly gloved fingers and began to twist it loose.

I broke into a sprint, jumping over the counter and toppling chairs as I went. That last light went out just as I got to the exit. I bashed through the door, breaking the glass in the process. As I rolled into the parking lot I heard a distant scream, and then something whispered right next to my ear in dead silence. It had the same tinny distortion as the McDonald’s tune

“Come back. I want to see you smile.”

I haven’t told anyone about what happened there that night. There was an article online saying Oroska burned to the ground a few days later. I don’t know if it was a cover up or something else, but I’m never going back to find out.

I didn’t share this because I want you to get involved, by the way. I shared it to warn you what happens when you do.

You can go to a new McDonald’s, keep getting your Big Macs, get your McCafe coffee, that’s fine. They did something to the remodels to make them safe, at least for now.  
But don’t ever go into an old McDonald’s. Not even the drive thru.

I’ve got to stop typing now and get some pain meds.

My jaw hurts and the hand I snapped in that register has been getting itchy.

The End. Now leave. Leave this story.

1katvtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver40/comments/1katvtc/my_partner_accused_me_of_lyinghaving_a_pretense/,My partner accused me of lying/having a pretense,"OK so my question is—is this normal?

My partner has now twice (last time was in February) accused me of having a pretense. The first time it was when I offhandedly made a suggestion of where we could live if he got a job in a certain city. He said I was being manipulative. I am having trouble remembering what the pretense was supposed to be around. He really got angry, ended up saying he felt like I was gaslighting him and telling me he was going to start recording all of our conversations. I then broke up with him and hung up on him. 

Well I got back together with him. Today he’s visiting family due to a, not super acute emergency, but like a health situation. So anyway, I asked him for his blue dot (his location) so I could send him a coffee shop suggestion. (I love coffee, he drinks it on long drives, I also did coffee shop suggestions for his drive down Saturday.) He gave me just the city he was leaving from. I saw there are two highways going from it either of which he could be taking depending on where in the city he is so I asked where in the city.

Anyway he told me he’s not stupid, he knows I’m just trying to get his location to make sure he’s where he says he is, and I’m using the pretense of looking for a cafe to get that info.

I am just…I’m shaking with anger and humiliation. I can’t believe he’d think about my motives that way? My ex partner who was VERY abusive once told me I was lying about being thirsty so I could stop for coffee. Is it normal to accuse your partner of lying/being manipulative/having a pretense about something? I haven’t given him a reason not to trust me as far as I know.

I was reminiscing an old job I had and I figured the people on this subreddit would appreciate this. Buckle up everyone, it's a wild ride! All rise for Judge Charlotte!

This happened back in 2018 when I (20F at the time) worked at this truly god awful call center for one of the many phone service providers. All I can say about that place is I'm SO glad I'm out of there.

This was at a time where I was at my lowest. I was depressed, had zero motivation, and the only reason I was ever actually going into work was half because my body was running on auto-pilot, and half because I liked the routine. It gave me something to work with, therefore my brain had enough to be distracted from the torment that built in my mind.

One day, I got a call from a customer who wanted a credit on a late fee. When I would get these calls, I would usually give them a credit regardless of the amount. Times are hard, yk? Why am I gonna make somebody struggle when I can easily help them over $5?

This time, though, holy cheese balls.

I'm sitting at my cubicle, waiting for a call on a slow day, when this piece of work calls.

Me: Thank you for calling [insert place I work], this is doesnotexist9, may I have--

Dude: About DAMNED time, I was on hold for almost two hours! (this was a lie, everyone in this shift had a 10-ish minute break between calls. It was slow.)

Me, obviously wanting to be nice: Oh, I'm so sorry about that! Let me take your name, and your four-digit pin so I can help assist you faster.

Dude: [scoffs] Isn't my information already on the screen? Why do I need to repeat it?

Me: This is purely for verification purposes, sir. I need to verify you so I can access the account.

Dude: I already went through that with the automated voice! Why do I need to do it again!

Me: Sir. I don't know your name. I need to verify you.

This goes on for fifteen minutes, I kid you not. I don't even know how I managed to keep my cool at the time, as I seem to have anger issues now! Eventually, he gives me his information and I see the balance he owes at the top of the screen. $3000. I think, maybe he called to make the payment. So the call proceeds as such.

Me: Okay sir, now that we have your account verified, how can I help you?

Dude: Yeah, I need a credit made to the account.

Me: ...for how much?

Dude: $3000.

I put myself on mute at this point, for a few seconds only. I start bracing myself to get yelled at because I'm about to tell him that even if I was able to give him the credit, I could only give him a credit for $1499.99. I unmute myself, and tell him that I'd be happy to look into his issue and that I would need to look at his previous bills for further investigation. He doesn't sound too pleased with that, but doesn't say much after that.

I'm scrolling through this dude's past bills, and I come to the conclusion that the balance on the account is purely in late fees. $3000 in LATE FEES. I don't remember from when they started or when the call happened, but I do remember thinking, just how in the ever loving heck do you let this happen?? And how does this dude have service up still??

Taking a deep breath, I go back and talk to him.

Me: Okay sir, I looked into things on my end, and I unfortunately can't give you that credit.

Dude: What? Why the heck not?

Me: Because the balance on your account is all due to late fees. Plus, even if I wanted to, this is beyond the amount we're allowed to give.

Then he just starts screaming at me, going on a rant about how I'm incompetent, how I suck at my job, and how I can't do the one thing he called for me to do. I'm ignoring him, sipping at my Irish coffee (this job sucked, I needed it :)) when he drops this absolute banger of a line.

Dude: I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna kashoot you straight in the freaking head.

Keep in mind, he had no idea where he called to. I, on the other hand, had his home address right in front of me. He lived states away, so I had nothing to worry about. I had half a mind to read it out to him so he knew he had no power over me. On the other hand, this was probably the lowest point in my life. I had nothing to live for at that moment. I possibly have gone farther than rock bottom, and I felt nothing anymore.

So without missing a beat, I talk.

Me: Sir, you'd actually be doing me a favor. Now are you gonna pay in credit or in debit?

It's silent for a full minute. I'm simply waiting for a response. I start to think maybe he hung up, when he finally speaks.

Dude: Credit. Let me get my card.

So I take his number, he makes the payment, and I end the call with a cheery ""And thank you so much for calling [place of work] I hope you have a wonderful rest of your night!"" when he hangs up.

My supervisor pulls me into an office the next day and asks if I'm alright. I'm confused for a sec before I remember that people actually listen to our calls. He was notified by the person doing my audit, and I was almost sent to a therapist. I ended up declining, as I didn't have the right insurance for a good one at the time.

I don't regret telling him that. I hope he learned his lesson about talking to call center representatives :) and if anyone cares, I'm 27 now and I'm doing a lot better. Nothing extraordinary is happening in my life at the moment, but I'm okay with that. I'm just glad I'm not that way anymore. Things are looking up, and I'm proud for being in the place I am right now :)

Though, I am thinking about it more these days and I wonder if I was wrong for reacting the way I did. Did I go overboard? Was that unnecessary? Was I the AH? :( ",5,1745948075.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

I (38F) had a colonoscopy yesterday, and a biopsy was taken of my ulcerated terminal ileum, which they said has a narrowing compatible with Chrons (Stricture. They couldn't get the scope through). I'm still trying to get my head around what all this means, but I have a followup to be booked with a GI specialist at a hospital and some bloodwork to do.

I've had my share of weird medical stuff and tummy troubles throughout my life, but Chrons was never suggested as a possibility. At most, I thought I had occasional GERD (maybe I still do?) With some foods like coffee setting off bad acid reflux and nausea. 

I'm not in pain every day. Most things I eat don't give me a lot of trouble, and if I do have pain I always attributed it to gas/acid, or having a slow gut (constipation's always a battle) I figured this was just my normal? It's weird thinking this whole time maybe it was something else.

So...if it is Chrons, and you were starting at the very beginning of your own journey, do you have any advice/apps/websites to check out (or avoid) to start overhauling my diet? I know it's a different journey for everyone, I just feel kind of lost waiting for the biopsy and blood results.

1katnsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Panera/comments/1katnsc/am_i_being_taken_advantage_of_or_being_dramatic/,Am I being taken advantage of or being dramatic?,"(TL;DR: older manager inefficiently plans our closing shifts. everyone’s upset because our time is being wasted.)

alright, so i’ve been working at Panera for about 3 years now, and one of our managers is notorious for being….THAT manager. let’s call her karen, for confidentiality and it’s fitting. of all the employees i’ve worked with, not one person has anything nice to say about karen. many employees, including myself, have complained to our other managers about her countless times, even the managers complain about her, and yet she continues to treat us all like children.

one of the big problems most people have with karen is how much longer it takes to close the restaurant while she’s managing, no matter how fast we’re done cleaning our stations, she will find busy work for us until she’s finished with her own office work. and she won’t let any of us leave if other people are still cleaning up, she will make us stay until everybody is 100% done, so we’re often stuck there past 10 pm (we close at 9:00).

that being said, lately when i’ve had to work closing shifts with karen, she’s been taking a slight advantage of our time. she’ll put herself on dining room for the night, while i work register and close the bakery. for the majority of the night, karen will only take back dishes, refill coffee, and wipe tables, then spend the rest of her time in the office. any other task that needs to be done in the dining room, she will tell someone else to do it. not ask, i mean tell. 

then, by the time we’re closed and my station is clean and i’m expecting to get out at a reasonable time (9:30), karen will tell me at the last minute, “okay, sweeping and mopping needs to be done in the dining room.” meaning, she expects me to do it all on my own. this also includes having to deck scrub the bathrooms, which takes roughly 30 minutes alone to do. 

now, i am above 18 years old, so it’s legal for any manager to keep my past my shift time if they need to, and karen is around 70 years old, so i understand it’s hard for her to complete some tasks. but i feel like there’s a much more efficient way to go about this. i would much rather prefer that she just puts me on dining room when i come in for my shift, because that way i can guarantee everything will be cleaned up in a timely manner. or she could just tell me in advance that she’s going to need my help in the dining room so i know what to expect. it’s really disappointing when i think i’m going to get out of work early just for her to pile more time consuming tasks on my plate at the last minute.

other employees feel the same way. she lacks in helping the line cooks and our dish washer, which results in them taking longer to clean their stations as well. the last time i closed with karen, she did put me on dining room to train a new girl, but then she switched everyone’s positions an hour into my shift with no warning. she put our register person on dishwasher, moved our dishwasher to the line, then put me on register while she “trained” the new girl. i put trained in quotes because really, karen had new girl do 2 hours worth of e-learning, then told her to wipe down the bathrooms before clocking out. new girl actually told me that while she was cleaning the bathrooms, she asked karen, “how long will this take? i’m just wondering because my mom is already here to pick me up and she’s in a hurry, she has somewhere important to be.” and karen responded with, “she’s just gonna have to wait, yknow sometimes you’re going to have to stay later to help the rest of us.” not only was that a rude response, but new girl is under 18, so karen cannot keep any minor past their set shift time. our dish person also complained on that same night, because there were dishes overflowing in the sink from hours ago, and karen did not help her wash any dishes the whole night. and of course, she left me to sweep and mop the dining room, and deck scrub the bathrooms by myself after we closed. 

with the way karen is running things, none of us are able to leave until 10:30 or after, which doesn’t sound very late, but that’s still a whole extra hour everyone has to spend in the restaurant doing karen’s dirty work, when we could all be home already. we all think karen could be more efficient, but she refuses to implement change when the other managers discuss their issues with her.

i feel like it would be much easier on everyone if karen gave us a more thought out plan for the night as soon as we clock in, so we will know what to expect and be aware of what needs to be done in advance.

please let me know what you think.

1katn97,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1katn97/avoidant_or_just_not_interested/,Avoidant or just not interested?,"Context: I’ve known this guy over 2 years. We have great chemistry, attraction, etc. but bad timing. He was in a relationship, but our connection grew unpredictably over the years. There was a period of months we were texting all day, every day, meeting for coffee and hikes, etc. 

His boyfriend cheated and they broke up 5 months ago. He confided in me easily up until that point, then abruptly withdrew. Over recent months, his communication gradually decreased. He would answer all my questions, but grew less patient over time. Eventually told me he likes me, but wanted to be alone for the time being, and didn’t want to lead me on in the meantime.

Since then, he hardly contacts me. He does respond when I reach out. We’ve met for coffee a few times. I see him at the gym and our interactions are friendly. He started working out with a new guy and preemptively explained the other guy had a partner who he was also close to (showed me pictures without me asking). As if he perceived what it looked like to me and wanted to set the record straight. And he said recently “you can text me whenever to get coffee” which I did a few days later and he agreed to it.

So is he avoidant (as he’s recently out of a long term relationship) or has he just lost interested in me? I’m just trying to live my life regardless, but it would be nice to understand.",1,1745947571.0,emotionalintelligence,1,1.0,False

**#7. Sweets are made of dates, seeds, and oranges**

It is best to drink spicy tea with sweets made of nuts and dried fruits.

Then nuts or seeds, which will give the candy texture, and flavorings – orange or lemon juice, spices. The [cooking](https://elenasunshinemagazine.medium.com/how-to-replenish-your-strength-in-winter-with-the-help-of-nutrition-ac708ae8dbf6?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------) time is 40 minutes.

**Ingredients for 20 pieces:**

Dates 10.58oz  
Sunflower seeds 3.53oz  
Juice of 1 orange  
Cocoa powder 2 tablespoons

**Instruction:**

Dates for sweets need large ones – such that the skin is easily separated. Leave them in hot water for 40 minutes, then remove the skin and remove the bones. Fry the seeds in a steel pan.

First, punch the dates with a blender until smooth. Then add two-thirds of the seeds, and orange juice and punch again with a blender. The mass should be equal, and dense, and the crushed seeds give it a texture.

Lubricate your hands with coconut oil and roll small balls. Put it on a plate and put it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Grind one-third of the seeds in a spice mortar. Get the candies out of the refrigerator and roll them – part in cocoa powder, part in crushed seeds. It is better to keep such sweets in the refrigerator, and they are stored for up to five to seven days. Bon Appetit!

Sweets made from[ natural](https://elenasunshinemagazine.medium.com/healthy-recipes-and-ways-of-using-rosehip-in-cooking-c09ab5612213?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------) ingredients will not contain harmful additives or a lot of sugar. Sweets and [cookies](https://elenasunshinemagazine.medium.com/healthy-and-delicious-pumpkin-recipes-70ea829346c7?source=user_profile---------11----------------------------) can be prepared using dried fruits, natural juices, and nuts.

(No real names used)


So these are just who are involved. So my Mom (46f) and my dad (40m) my stepsister (13f) and my stepmom (44f) and I (11f).
So my dad, let’s call him Ralph. Ralph Is a narcissist and a very selfish and very self loving person (in a bad way) and I don’t like my dad, because he treated me badly which In my opinion I don’t think anybody wants to live with. So just for what he has done…he has fx I think I was around 4-6 years old when he has taken him on his lap and pulled down my pants and hit me (I had a mark for a week) my mom has told me he has also done it when I was even younger also but I don’t remember because I was like in kindergarten. Anyways, he doesn’t like when I don’t like my food (I’m s picky eater…) and one time he also gave me some food I didn’t like, and he knew I didn’t like it, so I told him I don’t like that kind of food. I learned from my mom that he had texted her. Dad: “(my name) doesn’t want to eat her food and says she doesn’t like it, what should I do?” So my mom obviously says. Mom: “well if she doesn’t like it she doesn’t have to eat it so just let her not eat it” something near that. Does my dad listen? Nope, he does the dumbest thing that came to mind and legit locked me inside the bathroom, with the plate of food and said that, i can’t get out until I have eaten it all. No I couldn’t like, flush it out because he was standing on the other side of the door waiting for me to be done eating it. I WAS SIX! You don’t treat a six year old like that. So that was long ago and I still saw him every second weekend (my parents are divorced obviously) whatever, he always yelled at me and if I didn’t listen he would grab my by my shirt either at the collar or the back or something like that, and he would lean down with his face close to mine with his teeth gritted and talk down at me and he would be really angry and I would legit cry. Another time, I dont really remember what happened, but I just remember I got sad after they were angry at me (by they I mean my dad and step mom) and I had to go to bed and I would try and hug my dad goodnight. He didn’t hug back but kinda push me away and say “go to bed” in an angry tone and I had to go to bed and cry myself to sleep. I think yall can already tell why I don’t like my dad. Okay so we have reached the most traumatising part now. So my mom drive me 2 hours to my dads house to set me off with my moms now ex-boyfriend but at taht time he was my stepdad, let’s call him John so, they walked with inside ‘for a cup of coffee’ my mom had told me before we came that I could just choose to go back home with them if I didn’t want to stay. So that I actually did…or should I said “tried to” but as you would guess, my dad wasn’t a fan of that. He grabbed me and said I had to stay and held me in a ‘hug’ and said to my mom and John “just go, it’s kind of hard for her right now” my mom didn’t leave (luckily) and said that “she clearly doesn’t want to stay so we will take her with home” my dad refused. I don’t remember what then happened but then, my dad wasn’t holding me with his arm at my ribs tightly to make sure I didn’t go to my mom. (I almost couldn’t breathe. And I was crying) my mom and dad was arguing, and John chose to say something that legit made me question how he’s a living human. He said just to test my dad. John: “let my daughter go!” Like wtf I ain’t your daughter. Whatever my dad just said. Dad: “she’s not your daughter John” and then I don’t remember what then happened, I guess just arguing. And after some time my stepmom just said to my mom and John. “Just leave!” They didn’t, my mom just said to let’s call her, Susan “Susan. Don’t interfere!” And Susan finally shut her mouth (that doesn’t happen very often) so after more yelling and arguing. My dad chose to pull out his phone and call 911 and ask for his working place (he’s a police officer) and said “hey, yeah my ex-wife doesn’t want to leave my house” but he hung up because he realised they could hear me crying begging him to let me go. He finally let me go and I ran to my mom and hugged her and we left. (In the car) so before we left and I had calmed down in the car and stopped crying. I asked John. Me: “why the hell would you say ‘let my daughter go’ when you know my dad would be angry!?!” Guess what he says…John: “I just wanted to test him and try and go over his line” I swear to god…I looked at him and just said “what the (🦆) John! Why would you EVER test him in this moment!?!” I swear I didn’t care that he was autistic I wanted to hit that man with a frying pan. He just said he didn’t know.


So would AITA for not wanting to see or have contact with my dad even tho I’m a minor?",0,1745947368.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,0.5,False

I(19F) live with my mother(48F). My mom has been a single parent my whole life and had the support of my grandmother(who is now 69) in raising me which lead to us not being very close since she was constantly working. My grandmother was basically responsible for everything around the house until I eventually got old enough to start doing chores. My grandmother moved out when I was 16 and everything has been on me. The housework the laundry the groceries. My mom was still working at the time and I was job hunting, it wasn't so bad since she would drop me off at supermarkets and I'd only cook us dinner but over time things have gotten more harder to stay on top of. Ever since she started working from home, I cook her every meal and clean after her, I keep her own room clean and bathroom clean (she makes me clean it up when she goes out.) Any task around the house i do, like when she unexpectedly orders something that's heavy and I have to take it to her room or building furniture for her (I stayed up all night building her huge IKEA cabinets and drawers while she slept in my room💀)

 if I say I'm busy, or I don't want to she makes a whole big deal make me feel bad, saying I don't like her and stuff. Is this normal? One time I said I was tired because I've spent the whole day doing her stuff and she responded 'it's my job to do it' almost like she was shocked that I'd even ask such a thing. I finished 6th form in 2023 so it wasn't as stressful until in 2024 3 people moved into our house, I family members and a family freind. This was one of worst years of my life. I had to take care of 4 people, started to neglect myself because of it. One of them stayed in my room for 8 months due to no space. I never felt more drained to add to this I was threatened by my mom that if I make a problem for them that I would be kicked out. They were all so messy and inconsiderate they never did housework or cooked they would eat most of the food I'd come back from buying. My mom started making comments about how I'm not longer as 'put together' as i used to be. It was true i stopped taking care of myself. I spent that year running around for a job in hopes that my absence would force everyone to take responsibility for themselves but the job market is dogshit. (I've been job hunting since I was 16)

 i settled for doing art commissions online so i could save money up but my mom got a pay cut so I've had to help with paying for stuff with the money I've made. After 8 months 2 of them officially moved out, and one comes and goes from time to time (only staying for a week before travelling abroad) so it me and my mom again which gave me time to start looking after myself more. I still do everything around the house, and it's gotten to a point that she leaves messes in the kitchen and common areas knowing I'll clean up after her. I'm just so tired of having no input from her. At first I would understand because of work but recently she quit her job to start a business with her freind, it hasn't taken off yet and we've been relying on mine and some family freinds money to keep us going, despite this she doesn't do any mundane task for herself as long as I'm here she will make me do it. I don't feel as much sympathy anymore since I'm now the only one making money, I'm the only one doing anything. Even if I'm sick she'll expect me to cook and bring food to her room. Is this normal? Is anyone else's mom like this? She doesn't go down stairs to make herself coffee, as long as I'm here I should do it.

 I want to move out, but I don't have enough to move out and the business isn't making money yet. I told her today that it's ridiculous that I do everything for her and she can't even get herself breakfast since she slept in today, she brushed me off telling me 'don't worry I'll be out all week since I'll going to the office' completely ignoring what i was saying and talking over me (she's like about evey disagreement) . I woke up to clean the kitchen and buy stuff she wanted, made her breakfast and gave her snacks. Is it so bad I want to tell her to do it herself? I don't remember the last time she cooked anything herself. I'm just so over it but if feels like nothing will change. I how do I get her to stop pressuring just at least so I'm not doing everything all the time? I barely have time to go out and do anything teenagers do I'm always tired and never go to bed at a decent time, i just want a little more breathing room.",0,1745947352.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

I'm considering living in Prospect Park South. I currently live in very north park slope, but honestly the cost of living here is going beyond my means. I am a single female and in my late 20s, so the kid friendly neighborhood isn't a requirement for me. 

  
I have a dog so really love the accessibility to the park, plus for the money you can get much more space in that neighborhood. 

  
My main concerns are safety, especially if coming in late from Manhattan other parts of brooklyn. So curious are people who live in that neighborhood if they like the environment, food, coffee shops, bars, etc. ",0,1745947324.0,Brooklyn,4,0.33,False

I once read a very impactful book, but unfortunately, I’ve forgotten its title. I’d really love to find it again.

Here’s what I remember about the content:

- It was a transformational or motivational book with philosophical overtones.
- The main character was involved in track and field or something similar and had a wise mentor.
- There was a scene where the mentor and the protagonist talked about the importance of soft muscles — they were touching a cat’s muscles, which were soft and flexible, and compared them to the main character’s tense muscles.
- There was a moment about disappointment, described as not betrayal, but the loss of one’s own illusions about a person.
- One of the characters owned a coffee shop or something similar, which burned down. He cried but calmly continued to live his life, even though it was all he had.
- The protagonist met a much younger girl (maybe 17 years old), and he really liked her. I think they met again about 10 years later and eventually got together.
- The girl, the coach, and the coffee shop owner were all very spiritually aware, perhaps part of the same philosophy or school of thought.

A faded logo of ""Robarazzi"" flickers on the screen as he sighs heavily, burying his face in his hands.



Robbie (muttering): “Man, I really messed up. I wanted laughs, but all I got was...a disaster. My friends hate me, and I don’t blame them.”  



Tori walks into the lounge, carrying a notebook. She notices Robbie slumped in his chair and approaches him with concern.



Tori (gently): “Hey, Robbie. You okay? You look like someone stole Rex’s wardrobe.”  

Robbie (looking up): “Oh, hey, Tori. Yeah...it’s just...I’ve been thinking about ‘Robarazzi.’ I thought it’d be funny, but I ended up hurting you guys. I feel awful about it.”  

Tori (sits next to him): “I know you didn’t mean to hurt us. You got caught up in the fame, that’s all. But wanting to make things right? That’s a good start. Have you thought about how to fix it?”  

Robbie: “Actually, yeah. What if I made a documentary? About all of you? Like...something that shows what makes each of you amazing. Maybe I can prove how much you mean to me.”  



Tori perks up, her curiosity piqued.  

Tori: “That’s...a surprisingly good idea, Robbie! I love it! You could film André making music, or Jade directing something epic—there’s so much to work with!”  

Robbie (hopeful): “You think they’d go for it? After everything I did?”  

Tori: “It’ll take some convincing, but if you show them how much you care, I think they’ll say yes. Let’s do it!”  

Robbie (smiling): “Thanks, Tori. I owe you one. Or...several.”



Tori laughs, and Robbie closes his laptop, determination flickering in his eyes.



Scene: Robbie approaches André, who is absorbed in tweaking a beat on his keyboard. The room hums with the low vibrations of André’s music.



Robbie: “Hey André, can I talk to you for a sec?”  

André (without looking up): “Hold up—almost nailed this part...and...done! What’s up, Robbie?”  



Robbie fidgets nervously as André turns his chair toward him.  

Robbie: “I know things got...pretty messed up with ‘Robarazzi.’ I wasn’t trying to hurt anyone; I just got carried away. But I want to make things right! I’m making a documentary about all of you—showcasing your talents, your awesomeness. You’d be the music star, obviously.”  

André (leaning back, skeptical): “A documentary, huh? Not, like...more embarrassing footage, right?”  

Robbie (shaking his head vigorously): “No way! This is all about respect, man. I swear.”  

André (pauses, then smirks): “You know what? That actually sounds cool. You’re trying to fix things, and I respect that. Count me in—but no juice spills near my keyboard!”  

Robbie (relieved): “Deal! Thanks, André. You’re a legend.”





Scene: Robbie tiptoes into the Blackbox Theater, where Jade is rehearsing a dramatic scene under dim, moody lighting. She glares as Robbie interrupts.



Robbie: “Uh, Jade? Can I have a minute?”  

Jade (crossing her arms): “What do you want, Shapiro? Make it quick—I’ve got revenge to plot.”  

Robbie (gulping): “I—uh—wanted to apologize for ‘Robarazzi.’ I know I went way too far. But I’m trying to make it up to everyone by making a documentary that shows how awesome you all are. Would you...maybe want to be in it?”  

Jade (eyes narrowing): “Why should I trust you? You lied, humiliated me, and now you want me to smile for your camera?”  

Robbie (earnestly): “Because I really want to fix this. I messed up, but I want to show how incredible you are—and not just your usual terrifying self.”  

Jade (sighs): “Fine. But if you mess this up, you’ll regret it—and trust me, I can get creative.”  

Robbie (nodding quickly): “I won’t! I promise. Thanks, Jade!”  

Jade: “Don’t thank me yet, Shapiro.”





Scene: Robbie spots Cat spinning and giggling as she practices her dance routine. Her sparkly outfit twinkles under the fluorescent lights.



Robbie: “Hey Cat, can I talk to you for a minute?”  

Cat (stopping mid-spin): “Hi Robbie! Sure, what’s up?”  

Robbie: “I feel bad about...everything with ‘Robarazzi.’ I crossed some lines, and I want to make it up to you and everyone else. I’m working on a documentary to show off everyone’s talents. Would you—uh—be part of it?”  

Cat (gasps, bouncing excitedly): “That sounds amazing! I can dance, and sing, and maybe wear glitter—but not too much glitter, because Jade said glitter makes me look like a fairy disco ball.”  

Robbie (laughing nervously): “Just be yourself, Cat. That’s all I need.”  

Cat (spinning again): “Yay! This is going to be so fun! Thanks for picking me, Robbie!”  



Robbie grins, feeling reassured by Cat’s contagious excitement.

  


Scene: Robbie sits in the lounge with Tori, scribbling notes for his documentary. The group’s tentative trust motivates him to give it his all.



Robbie (confidently): “We’ve got this. I’m not giving up until this documentary is something we’re all proud of.”  

Tori (smiling): “That’s the spirit, Robbie. Let’s keep going.”



Scene: The music room is set up for Tori’s performance, with a keyboard in one corner and posters of past performances lining the walls. Robbie adjusts the camera, a slightly oversized film director’s hat perched on his head.



Robbie (peeking out from behind the camera): “Alright, Tori. Ready to show the world what Hollywood Arts’ biggest star can do?”  

Tori (laughing): “Biggest star? Aren’t you worried Trina will hear you and steal that title?”  

Robbie: “Fair point. Let me rephrase: Ready to show the world what Hollywood Arts’ most talented star can do?”  

Tori (grinning): “Much better. Let’s do this.”  



Tori steps up to the mic, closing her eyes as the opening chords play. Her voice fills the room, effortlessly blending emotion and power. Robbie watches through the camera lens, nodding enthusiastically.  



Robbie (muttering to himself): “This is gold. Pure, glittering gold. Spielberg, eat your heart out.”  



As Tori finishes, Robbie lowers the camera and starts clapping dramatically.  



Robbie: “Bravo, Tori! That was incredible. Like...Grammy-level incredible.”  

Tori (pretending to bow): “Why, thank you, Mr. Shapiro. Did I live up to your cinematic vision?”  

Robbie (laughing): “You did. Now I just need to figure out how to make this look even more epic in post-production.”  



They exchange smiles, the excitement of creating something meaningful evident between them.





Scene: The recording studio hums with energy. Shelves of music equipment line the walls, and colorful soundproofing panels give the room a professional but funky vibe. André sits at his keyboard, tapping out the opening notes of a melody while bobbing his head to the beat. Robbie adjusts his camera, balancing on a stool with determination.



Robbie (grinning): “Alright, André, the world’s ready to witness your genius. You ready?”  

André (chuckling): “Man, I’m always ready. Let’s make some magic.”  



André starts playing a soulful melody on the keyboard, filling the room with rich harmonies. As the camera focuses on his hands gliding across the keys, André suddenly switches it up—transitioning into a funky beat and snapping his fingers for rhythm.  



Robbie (from behind the camera): “Oh, now we’re talking! This is why you’re the music legend of Hollywood Arts.”  



With a smooth pivot, André sets down the keyboard, picks up his guitar, and launches into a jaw-dropping solo. He throws in a dramatic flourish, pretending to strum the final chord with his teeth.  



Robbie (laughing): “Okay, that’s unfair. How are the rest of us supposed to compete with you when you do that?”  

André (grinning): “It’s all about the vibe, man. Glad to be part of this masterpiece you’re cooking up.”  

Robbie: “And you just gave me the best scene! This documentary is practically directing itself.”



André chuckles, jamming a few more playful chords on the guitar as Robbie pans the camera for a wide shot of the studio, capturing the artistic chaos of André’s creative world.



Scene: The Blackbox Theater is dimly lit, with a single spotlight illuminating the stage where Jade stands. Props from her short film—including a fake tombstone and a flickering lantern—create an eerie mood. Robbie nervously adjusts his camera, occasionally glancing at Jade, who is reviewing her script.



Robbie: (clearing his throat): “Uh...Jade? Can I just say, you’re...incredible. Your dedication is...terrifyingly inspiring.”  

Jade (without looking up): “Cut the flattery, Shapiro. Just make sure you capture this right. If I see one second of sloppy work, that camera becomes your new pillow.”  



Robbie gulps, adjusting his camera frantically. Jade steps into the spotlight, her presence commanding the room.

Jade (beginning her monologue, intense): “The darkness swallowed me whole, but I refused to let it consume my soul. I will rise—unstoppable, untouchable—like the storm itself!”  



Robbie watches through the camera lens, mesmerized by Jade’s raw emotion. As she transitions to directing her actors, her sharp tone fills the theater.  

Jade (to her cast): “Move the lantern three inches to the left! And stop breathing so loudly! You’re supposed to be dead!”  



Robbie tries to hold back a nervous laugh but fails.  

Robbie (chuckling): “You’re intense, Jade, but it’s kind of amazing.”  

Jade (glaring at him): “You want intense? Keep laughing, and I’ll make you the star of my horror sequel.”  

Robbie (panicking): “Nope! No laughing! Just filming—perfectly filming!”  



Despite her intimidating demeanor, Robbie captures Jade’s performance and direction flawlessly, showcasing her talent and commitment to her craft.



Scene: Robbie enters the dance studio, which is decorated with colorful streamers and glitter-covered props. Cat, dressed in a sparkly red outfit and mismatched shoes, is spinning in circles while holding a stuffed unicorn. Robbie sets up the camera, trying not to get distracted.



Cat (giggling): “Hi Robbie! Ready to see my dance moves? I’ve been practicing for hours!”  

Robbie: (smiling nervously) “Absolutely, Cat. Let’s see what you’ve got. Just...don’t knock over the unicorn.”  



Cat drops the unicorn with dramatic flair and launches into her dance routine. Her moves are a mix of pirouettes, cartwheels, and random jumps that somehow blend into an energetic and captivating performance.



Robbie (behind the camera): “Wow, Cat! You’re amazing! Your energy is...contagious. And slightly terrifying.”  



Cat giggles as she twirls across the studio, accidentally tripping over a glitter ball but recovering with a perfectly timed pose.



Cat (bouncing back up): “Thanks, Robbie! This is SO much fun! Do you think I should add more jumping? Or maybe bubble machines!”  

Robbie (laughing): “Let’s keep it simple for now, Cat. But the bubble machines sound...very you.”  



Cat finishes her routine with a dramatic bow, throwing imaginary confetti into the air as Robbie applauds.



Robbie: “You’re a superstar, Cat. This documentary wouldn’t be complete without you!”  

Cat (hugging the unicorn): “Aww, Robbie! You’re the best director ever!”



Scene: Robbie enters the main theater, where Beck is rehearsing under the glow of stage lights. The stage is set with minimal props—a wooden bench and a backdrop painted to resemble an autumn park. Beck is rehearsing a dramatic monologue, exuding effortless charm as he performs.



Robbie (approaching cautiously): “Hey Beck, got a minute?”  

Beck (looking up and smiling): “Sure, Robbie. What’s up?”  



Robbie fidgets with his camera, momentarily distracted by Beck’s polished delivery.

Robbie: “I just wanted to say...thanks for not throwing tomatoes at me during ‘Robarazzi.’ That was pretty kind of you.”  

Beck (grinning): “Well, I figured Jade would handle that for both of us.”  



Robbie laughs nervously, glancing toward the shadows as if expecting Jade to materialize. He regains his composure and continues.

Robbie: “I’m making a documentary to make up for...you know, everything. It’s about showcasing everyone’s talents and how amazing you all are. Would you be in it?”  

Beck (thoughtful, crossing his arms): “I appreciate that you’re trying to fix things, Robbie. Count me in. What do you need me to do?”  

Robbie (smiling): “Just be yourself and show off your acting skills. Honestly, this scene alone is enough to make people jealous of your coolness.”  

Beck: “No problem, man. Let’s do this.”



Robbie sets up his camera, watching Beck as he transitions effortlessly back into his monologue. Beck’s voice carries emotion and subtle power, his movements commanding the stage without seeming rehearsed. Robbie mutters in awe from behind the lens. 

Robbie (quietly): “This guy could star in every movie ever made...and still not break a sweat.”  



As Beck finishes the scene, he flashes Robbie an easy smile.

Beck: “So, did I live up to Spielberg’s standards?”  

Robbie: (clapping enthusiastically) “You went beyond them. Seriously, Beck, this footage is gold!”  



Beck chuckles and leans casually against the stage prop, clearly unfazed by the praise.  

Beck: “Glad to help, Robbie. Let me know if you need anything else—although I draw the line at singing.”



Scene: Robbie is in the music room, where he’s reviewing footage from earlier shoots. His camera suddenly starts glitching, showing fuzzy images and flickering lights. Robbie groans, running a hand through his hair.



Robbie (frustrated): “Great. Now the camera decides to audition for a horror movie.”  



Tori walks in, carrying a cup of coffee. She notices Robbie’s distressed expression and sets the coffee down on the table next to him. 



Tori: “Robbie, what’s up? You look like Rex just insulted your cooking.”  

Robbie (pointing to the camera): “This stupid thing won’t focus. I’ve adjusted every setting, and nothing works. I’m one malfunction away from turning this into a documentary about my descent into madness.”  

Tori (laughing): “Okay, dramatic much? Let me take a look.”  



Tori kneels down, fiddling with the camera settings. She presses a few buttons and adjusts the lens, and the image sharpens instantly.  



Tori: “See? Sometimes it just needs a gentle touch. Or as I call it—the Tori touch.”  

Robbie (sighing in relief): “You’re a lifesaver, Tori. Seriously. I want this to be perfect, you know? Not just for me—but for everyone.”  

Tori (smiling): “And it will be. You’re doing great, Robbie. Just keep pushing through.”  

Robbie (renewed determination): “You’re right. No camera glitch is going to stop me from finishing this.”  



Scene: Later, in the dance studio, Cat is spinning across the floor, rehearsing a chaotic but charming dance routine. Robbie sets up the camera, ensuring the lighting frames Cat perfectly. Suddenly, the camera screen goes black.



Robbie (panicking): “No! Not now! Why does this camera hate me?”  



Cat halts mid-spin, clutching a prop balloon and looking concerned.



Cat: “Robbie, is the camera...okay? Did it faint? Do cameras faint?”  

Robbie (frantically pressing buttons): “It’s just a minor issue. Totally fixable. Probably.”  



After a tense moment, Robbie checks the power cable and notices it’s slightly loose. He reconnects it, and the screen flickers back to life. Cat squeals excitedly and bounces on her toes.  



Cat: “You fixed it! Yay, Robbie! You’re like a camera doctor!”  

Robbie (laughing): “Thanks, Cat. Let’s finish your scene before the camera changes its mind again.”  



Scene: Back in the lounge, Robbie is sitting at a table, reviewing footage from the day on his laptop. His brow furrows as he notices a blurry clip from André’s segment. He rewinds the video, adjusting the settings on his editing software. Tori walks by and notices Robbie’s intense focus.  



Tori: “Robbie, you okay? You’ve been staring at that screen like it owes you money.”  

Robbie (without looking up): “I’m fine. Just...trying to figure out how to fix André’s blurry footage without making him look like a hologram.”  

Tori: “Well, at least that’d be futuristic. Seriously, take a break! You’re doing amazing, and you deserve a breather.”  

Robbie (leaning back and sighing): “Thanks, Tori. I’ll take a break—after I nail this edit.”  



He closes the laptop, determination flickering in his eyes.  



Robbie (to himself): “We’ve got this. I’m not giving up until this documentary is something we’re all proud of.”







Scene: In the Blackbox Theater, Jade is on stage directing her actors while Robbie sets up his camera at the back of the room. The theater is dimly lit, with eerie shadows cast by the spotlight Jade has positioned over a fake graveyard prop. Robbie adjusts his equipment nervously as Jade barks orders at her cast.



Jade: (snapping at an actor): “No, no, no! You’re supposed to look terrified, not mildly annoyed. Do you even know what terror is?”  

Actor (timidly): “Uh...not really?”  

Jade (glaring): “Then imagine me finding your Instagram from middle school. Terrifying enough?”  



The actor nods quickly, while Robbie chuckles nervously from behind his camera.  



Robbie: “Uh, Jade? Whenever you’re ready, I’m all set to film your brilliance.”  

Jade (turning sharply): “First of all, don’t use the word ‘brilliance’ like you’re sucking up. Second of all, the lighting is all wrong. It looks like we’re shooting a sitcom, not a psychological masterpiece!”  



Robbie glances at his camera, then at the stage lighting, his brow furrowed in confusion.  



Robbie: “I think it looks dramatic...ish?”  

Jade (rolling her eyes): “Dramatic-ish? No. Fix it. The shadows need to be sharper. I want it to feel like we’re summoning ghosts, not hosting a high school talent show.”  



Robbie hesitates but nods, scrambling to adjust the light filters and angles. He accidentally flips the wrong switch, and the stage is suddenly bathed in hot pink light. Jade stares at the stage, unimpressed.



Jade (deadpan): “Perfect. Let’s shoot a romantic comedy about murderous unicorns.”  

Robbie (panicking): “No, no! Wrong button—give me a second!”  



He fiddles with the controls, mumbling to himself, until the lighting finally shifts to an intense, moody crimson. The props now cast eerie shadows, and the stage feels appropriately sinister. Jade tilts her head, scrutinizing the new setup.  



Jade (grudgingly): “Better. You might have a shred of talent after all, Shapiro. Don’t get cocky.”  

Robbie (relieved): “Wouldn’t dream of it. Thanks for...uh...not breaking me.”  



Jade smirks and steps back onto the stage, delivering her directions with precision while Robbie adjusts his camera to follow her movement. The collaboration flows more smoothly as Robbie begins to anticipate Jade’s needs.



Jade (after a perfect shot): “Alright, that’ll do. You didn’t completely ruin my vision, so congrats on surviving.”  

Robbie (smiling): “High praise coming from you. Thanks, Jade. I’ve actually learned a lot from this.”  

Jade (mocking): “Yeah, I’m an excellent teacher. Now pack up your stuff before I change my mind.”



Robbie chuckles and starts packing up, feeling a new sense of confidence in his ability to work with even the toughest collaborator.



Scene: The group gathers in the lounge, sitting around Robbie’s whiteboard filled with messy notes, doodles of glitter explosions, and underlined ideas like “Interviews” and “Bloopers.” Robbie stands in front of the board, marker in hand, looking both nervous and determined.



Robbie (clearing his throat): “Alright, everyone. Thanks for being here. This documentary is about you—all of you. I want it to capture your talents and stories honestly. So…any ideas? Suggestions? Complaints? Please, no complaints about my camera work.”



André leans back in his chair, casually tapping his fingers on the table.  

André: “Behind-the-scenes footage. Show people the creative process—the hard work, the mess-ups, the late-night inspiration. It’ll make it more real.”  

Robbie (scribbling furiously): “Behind-the-scenes…got it! Maybe we show you working on a song late at night, fueled by artistic brilliance and caffeine.”  

André (laughing): “Don’t forget snacks. Snacks are key.”



Tori sits beside André, tapping her chin thoughtfully.  

Tori: “Interviews could be great too. Each of us talking about why we love what we do and what inspires us. It would add a personal touch.”  

Robbie (nodding enthusiastically): “Yes! Personal stories—heartfelt stuff. You guys sharing your passion for the arts…that’ll make it powerful.”  



Beck grins as he leans forward, his elbows resting on his knees.  

Beck: “Throw in bloopers. Everyone loves bloopers. Show people the fun side of Hollywood Arts.”  

Robbie (scribbling “BLOOPERS” in giant letters): “Fun side? Beck, I’ve got footage of you tripping onstage last week. That’s going in for sure.”  

Beck (mocking): “Only if we include Jade laughing at me.”



Cat’s eyes light up as she claps her hands together excitedly.

Cat: “Bloopers are the best! Can we do glitter bloopers? Like glitter everywhere while I’m dancing? Oh, oh—what about glitter explosions?”  

Jade (deadpan): “No glitter. No explosions. But bloopers are fine—as long as they’re not embarrassing me.”  

Robbie (grinning): “Noted. Minimal glitter, moderate explosions, and no Jade bloopers—unless approved.”



The group laughs as Jade rolls her eyes dramatically. 



Robbie (grateful): “Seriously, these ideas are awesome. Behind-the-scenes, interviews, bloopers…you guys are amazing. Thank you for helping make this documentary better than I ever imagined.”



Tori gives Robbie an encouraging smile, while André and Beck exchange playful remarks about their “bloopers moment.” Cat bounces in her seat, excitedly whispering about glitter possibilities. Jade crosses her arms, watching Robbie with a faint hint of approval.



Scene: The editing booth at Hollywood Arts is dimly lit except for the glow of Robbie’s laptop. The desk is cluttered with a chaotic mix of sticky notes, snack wrappers, and empty coffee cups. Robbie has his headphones on, meticulously tweaking the final edits of the documentary. The hum of music transitions between clips on the screen.



Robbie (to himself, focused): “Okay, transitions look good... audio levels are perfect... blooper reel is golden. Just need to double-check the credits.”  



He scrolls to the credit sequence, pausing to type “Executive Producer: Rex Powers” with a small smirk.  



The door creaks open as Tori enters, holding a tray of smoothies. She sets it down on the desk beside Robbie, leaning over to glance at the screen. 



Tori: “How’s it coming, Spielberg? Ready to wow the world?”  

Robbie (leaning back and stretching): “Almost. Just a few final tweaks. This has to be perfect, Tori. No room for glitches, no awkward cuts...and definitely no glitter explosions sneaking in!”  

Tori (laughing): “Don’t worry, Robbie. You’ve got this. The hard part’s over—you’ve already made something amazing.”  



As André, Beck, Cat, and Jade file in, Robbie sits up straighter, his nervousness melting into a smile as he sees his friends gathering.  



André (grinning): “Let me guess—you’re adding a special music section just for me? Maybe call it ‘Behind the Genius.’”  

Robbie (laughing): “Not a bad idea! But no, I think the scene of you jamming like a rockstar already speaks for itself.”  



Beck picks up a sticky note from the desk, squinting at the scribbled doodle of a glitter explosion labeled “Idea?”  



Beck: “You know, this note explains Cat’s entire brainstorming process.”  

Cat (giggling): “Glitter makes \*everything\* better!”  



Jade (rolling her eyes): “Just keep that glitter far away from me. And cut the applause in my segment—I’ll be perfectly intimidating without it.”  

Robbie (mock-seriously): “Of course, Jade. Nothing but hauntingly professional vibes for you.”  



The group laughs as Tori pats Robbie on the shoulder, her expression warm and encouraging.  



Tori: “You’ve done an incredible job, Robbie. Seriously, we’re all proud of you.”  

Robbie (smiling, touched): “Thanks, Tori. And thanks to all of you. I couldn’t have done this without you guys. This isn’t just my documentary—it’s ours.”  



He turns back to his laptop, his fingers flying over the keyboard as the final cut comes together. The group lingers around him, chatting and joking, their excitement palpable. 



Robbie (confidently, to himself): “Alright. Final scene...and export. We’re ready. Hollywood Arts, prepare to be amazed.”  



Scene: The theater at Hollywood Arts is buzzing with quiet anticipation. The seats are arranged in neat rows, and a large screen hangs at the front of the room, surrounded by dark velvet curtains. A small table in the corner is stacked with popcorn bags and drinks—a last-minute addition by Tori to make the premiere feel special. The friends file into the front row, chatting softly, while Robbie stands nervously at the side of the screen, holding a remote control.



Robbie (clearing his throat, stepping forward): “Alright, everyone. Thanks for coming. This documentary—it’s, uh...kind of a big deal for me. I just wanted to show how much I appreciate each of you. You’re all insanely talented, and I hope this does you justice.”  



Robbie fidgets with the remote, glancing nervously at the group. Tori gives him a reassuring smile.  



Tori (warmly): “We’re excited to see it, Robbie. You’ve worked so hard on this—you should be proud.”  



André (grinning): “Yeah, man. Let’s see what you’ve got. I’ve been hyping this up in my head all week!”  



Cat (bouncing in her seat): “I’m so excited! Do we get to see glitter bloopers? Please say there are glitter bloopers!”  



Jade (dryly, arms crossed): “Just play it already, Shapiro. If I hear the word ‘glitter’ one more time, I’m walking out.”  



The group laughs, and Robbie takes a deep breath, smiling nervously as he clicks the remote. The lights dim, and the theater is bathed in a soft glow from the screen. Gentle music plays as the opening credits roll, featuring sweeping shots of Hollywood Arts and the friends’ names written in elegant, bold lettering.  



The group leans forward, captivated by the visuals. A shot of André in the recording studio transitions smoothly into clips of Tori singing, Beck acting, Jade directing, and Cat dancing with her usual chaotic energy. Each segment flows into the next, highlighting their talents and unique personalities.  



Cat: (whispering to Beck): “Look, it’s me! I didn’t fall over in that shot!”  

Beck (smiling): “Progress.”  



Robbie sneaks a glance at his friends’ reactions, his heart racing as he waits for their feedback.



Scene: The documentary begins with a warm montage of behind-the-scenes footage. Clips of the group laughing and working together fill the screen—André composing, Jade directing, Tori rehearsing, Beck practicing lines, and Cat spinning in circles with a prop balloon. The transitions are smooth, accompanied by light, uplifting piano music that sets the tone for celebration.



Robbie (voiceover): “Hollywood Arts is more than a school. It’s a home for creativity, passion, and friendship. This is a tribute to the incredible people who make it shine.”  



The screen fades into Tori’s segment. She stands onstage, her voice flowing effortlessly as she performs her new song under soft, golden lights.



Robbie (voiceover): “Tori Vega, a talented singer-songwriter with a passion for music. Her dedication and stage presence light up every performance.”  



Tori’s confidence shines through in her delivery. The camera pans to the audience—Robbie steals a quick glance at her reaction. She leans toward him, whispering with a bright smile.  

Tori: “This is amazing, Robbie. Thank you.”  

Robbie (whispering back): “I’m glad you like it.”  



The documentary transitions into André’s segment, showing him in the recording studio. The screen fills with vibrant colors as André mixes tracks, sings, and riffs on his guitar.



Robbie (voiceover): “André Harris, a musical genius who can turn any melody into a masterpiece. His talent and creativity know no bounds.”  



The audience watches André throw in an impromptu flourish, strumming dramatically with a wide grin. He turns to Robbie, giving him a thumbs up.  

André: “You did good, Robbie. This is awesome.”  

Robbie (grinning): “Thanks, André.”  



Next, Jade’s segment begins. The screen darkens to a deep crimson hue, spotlighting Jade onstage as she delivers an intense monologue. The camera cuts to her directing with sharp precision, commanding the room.  



Robbie (voiceover): “Jade West, a fierce and dedicated artist with a passion for drama. Her intensity and commitment make her performances unforgettable.”  



Jade watches, her eyes narrowing as she scrutinizes the edits. After a beat, she nods approvingly.  

Jade: “Not bad, Robbie. Not bad at all.”  

Robbie (relieved): “I’m glad you think so, Jade.”  



The screen brightens into Cat’s segment, showcasing her energetic dance routine. Sparkly streamers and balloons frame the scene as Cat twirls and cartwheels with uncontainable enthusiasm.  



Robbie (voiceover): “Cat Valentine, a bundle of energy and joy. Her infectious enthusiasm and talent make every moment fun and memorable.”  



Cat giggles loudly, turning to Robbie with glitter-covered hands.  

Cat: “This is so much fun, Robbie! Thank you!”  

Robbie (smiling): “You’re welcome, Cat.”  



Finally, Beck’s segment plays. The screen shifts to the main theater, where Beck rehearses a dramatic monologue. The lighting frames his expressions perfectly, capturing the depth of his performance.\*  



Robbie (voiceover): “Beck Oliver, a charismatic and talented actor who brings every character to life. His performances are captivating and inspiring.”  



Beck nods in approval, his smile reflecting his pride in Robbie’s work. 

Beck: “You really captured everyone’s essence, Robbie. Great job.”  

Robbie (grateful): “Thanks, Beck.”  



The documentary ends with a wide shot of the group standing together, their laughter echoing as the closing credits roll. Robbie glances nervously around the room, his heart racing.





Scene: The documentary concludes with a wide shot of the group standing together onstage, their laughter echoing through Hollywood Arts. Gentle piano music plays as the credits roll, fading into a quiet, heartfelt moment. The screen turns black, and Robbie’s voice fills the room, steady but vulnerable.



Robbie (voiceover): “I know I made mistakes with ‘Robarazzi,’ and I’m truly sorry for the hurt I caused. This documentary is my way of showing how much I value each of you and your incredible talents. You’re not just my friends—you’re my family. Thank you for inspiring me and for always being there.”  



The room stays silent for a few seconds after Robbie’s voice fades, the sincerity of his message lingering in the air. Slowly, the theater lights come back on, revealing the audience clapping warmly. Robbie hesitates for a moment, taking in the applause before glancing nervously at his friends seated in the front row.



Tori leans toward Robbie, her expression soft and teary-eyed.  

Tori (smiling): “That was beautiful, Robbie. You really put your heart into this. Thank you for sharing it with us.”  



André reaches out for a fist bump, his grin full of pride.  

André: “You knocked it out of the park, man. This was amazing—the edits, the music, the whole vibe. You nailed it.”  



Jade crosses her arms, her usual sharp demeanor softened by a rare, approving smile.

Jade: “You did good, Shapiro. You’ve redeemed yourself. Just remember—mess up again, and this smile disappears forever.”  



Robbie chuckles nervously, relief washing over him as Jade’s smirk deepens. Before he can say more, Cat leaps out of her seat and pulls him into a hug, nearly knocking the popcorn off his lap.  

Cat (giggling): “This was the BEST! You’re the BEST! Thank you, Robbie!”  



Beck steps forward, placing a steady hand on Robbie’s shoulder.  

Beck: “We’re proud of you, man. You captured everyone perfectly. Great job.”  



Robbie glances at each of his friends, his eyes shining with gratitude. He takes a deep breath, his voice steady and full of emotion.  

Robbie: “Thanks, guys. Really. I couldn’t have done this without you—your ideas, your patience, your trust. This isn’t just my documentary—it’s ours.”  



The group exchanges warm smiles, and Tori pulls them into a spontaneous group hug, much to Jade’s light protest.  

Jade (grumbling): “Alright, group hug. But seriously, no one mess with my hair.”  



The theater fills with laughter as their bond feels stronger than ever. Robbie’s smile widens, his earlier doubts completely replaced by pride and relief.



Scene: The documentary’s screening has ended, and the group lingers in the theater, chatting softly as the applause fades. Robbie stands near the front row, fidgeting with his camera bag as Tori, André, Jade, Cat, and Beck approach him together. His eyes flicker nervously between them, his expression a mix of hope and anticipation.



Tori reaches him first, her gaze warm and steady.

Tori (smiling): “Robbie, we’re all proud of you. You’ve come such a long way, and you really showed how much you care about all of us.”  



Robbie’s face relaxes slightly, a hint of relief breaking through his nervous energy. André steps forward, grinning.  

André: “Yeah, man. You put in the work. This wasn’t just about making up for Robarazzi—it was about showing us you’ve got heart. And you proved it.”  



Jade follows, her arms crossed, but there’s no trace of her usual edge. Instead, her voice carries a rare softness.  

Jade: “You’ve earned our trust back, Shapiro. Just don’t mess it up again—or you’ll regret it.”  



Robbie chuckles lightly, his shoulders loosening as Cat bounces over, her smile radiant.  

Cat (giggling): “And you made us feel special! Robbie, this was so much fun. You’re, like, the best filmmaker EVER!”  



Before Robbie can respond, Beck pats him on the back with his trademark calm demeanor.  

Beck: “We’re all friends again, thanks to you. You brought us closer, man. That’s no small thing.”  



Robbie glances at each of his friends, his eyes glistening with unshed tears. He swallows hard, his voice trembling slightly as he speaks. 

Robbie: “Thank you, guys. Really. I couldn’t have done any of this without you—your help, your ideas, your support. You’re the best friends I could ever ask for.”  



Tori smiles and pulls him into a hug, which quickly turns into a group embrace as André, Cat, and Beck join in. Even Jade reluctantly steps into the circle, muttering under her breath.  

Jade: “If anyone touches my hair, they’re out of the hug.”  



The group laughs, the moment brimming with warmth and camaraderie. Robbie’s nervous energy has completely dissolved, replaced by gratitude and pride.



Scene: The group stands together at the front of the theater, their laughter and smiles filling the space. Robbie hesitates for a moment, still overwhelmed by the warmth and support of his friends. Tori steps forward, her arms wide as she pulls the group into an embrace.  



Tori (cheerfully): “To friendship!”  



André grins, throwing an arm around Robbie’s shoulder as he joins the hug.  

André: “And to Robbie’s redemption! You earned it, man.”  



Jade lingers at the edge for a beat, arms crossed. Finally, she steps in, smirking as she eyes Robbie.

Jade (playfully): “Don’t mess it up again, Shapiro. I’m not a fan of sequels.”  



Cat bounces into the hug, nearly knocking Tori off balance with her energy.  

Cat (giggling): “Group hug! This is the best day ever!”  



Beck rests a steady hand on Robbie’s back, his expression calm and supportive.  

Beck: “We’ve got each other’s backs, no matter what.”  



As the group tightens their embrace, Robbie finally speaks, his voice shaky but filled with emotion.\* 

Robbie (teary-eyed): “Thanks, guys. I don’t deserve friends like you—but I’m so lucky to have you.”  



Tori gives him an encouraging squeeze, while André chuckles softly.

André: “Don’t get all weepy on us now, Robbie. We’re just getting started.”  



The group laughs, their bond stronger than ever as they slowly break apart. Cat reaches for Robbie’s hand, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

Cat: “So...when’s the next documentary? I’ve got ideas—lots of glittery ideas!”  



Jade (sighing dramatically): “I knew she’d say that.”  



The friends laugh again as they walk out of the theater, their voices echoing down the halls of Hollywood Arts, ready for whatever creative adventure comes next.



Scene: Wok Star is bustling with energy, the air filled with the clinking of dishes and the sizzle of stir fry from the kitchen. The group sits at their favorite booth in the corner, the table crowded with steaming plates of noodles, dumplings, and rice bowls. A few lanterns hang overhead, casting a cozy glow over their laughter-filled conversation.



Tori (lifting her glass with a grin): “Here’s to new beginnings—and lots of amazing projects!”  



André (clinking his glass against hers): “And to sticking together, no matter what.”  



Jade (raising her glass, smirking): “Cheers. And no glitter explosions in those ‘amazing projects,’ please.”  



The group laughs as Cat bounces in her seat, raising her glass excitedly.\* 

Cat: “Cheers! Oh, and to dumplings! Dumplings deserve a toast too!”  



Beck (smiling warmly): “To us. No matter what, we’ve got each other’s backs.”  



The glasses clink together, the sound ringing out like a bell of unity. Robbie hesitates for a moment, looking around at his friends with a grateful smile. He raises his glass slightly, his voice soft but steady.  

Robbie: “To us. You guys are the best. And for what it’s worth...thanks for giving me a second chance.”  



Tori pats Robbie on the shoulder, her smile beaming with pride.

Tori: “You earned it, Robbie. And hey, I can’t wait to see what you come up with next!”  



André nudges Robbie playfully.

André: “Yeah, but no pressure, right? Just...top this documentary and we’ll call it even.”  



Jade (deadpan): “Don’t listen to him, Shapiro. Just try not to embarrass us next time.”  



Cat (giggling): “Ooh! Can your next project have glitter dumplings? Glitter makes everything better!”  



Robbie (laughing): “I think I’ll leave the glitter dumplings to Cat. But seriously, this has been incredible. You guys made all of this possible.”  



Tori: “And you reminded us how important it is to stick together. Here’s to even more crazy adventures at Hollywood Arts!”  



The group cheers as they dig into the food, sharing laughs and recounting moments from the documentary. André starts beatboxing a rhythm, which prompts Cat to hum a random melody. Beck joins in by tapping a spoon against his glass, creating an impromptu jam session at the table.



André (grinning): “See? We can make music anywhere. Hollywood Arts talent doesn’t take a break, even at Wok Star.”  



Jade (mock-serious): “As long as it doesn’t involve a ukulele, we’re fine.”  



The table bursts into laughter, with Cat gasping dramatically.  



Cat:: “But I love ukuleles! Oh, we should totally do a ukulele documentary next!”  



Beck (laughing): “I think Robbie needs a break before we throw more projects at him.”  



Robbie (smiling): “Yeah, I’ll admit, the editing marathon nearly broke me. But honestly, I can’t wait for whatever comes next. You guys make everything worth it.”  



The screen slowly pans out from the table, the lively atmosphere of Wok Star symbolizing the harmony and joy the group has reclaimed. Their laughter echoes as the scene fades to black, leaving viewers with a sense of warmth and optimism for the adventures ahead.

1kathfc,https://v.redd.it/u1g0k0cg4txe1,This is in .75 speed.. pay attention to little details,"Okay so just watch/listen because I’m going to sound like a nut for a second… 

so I slowed it down a bit so you can really pay attention.. first off, going to the store at 3am for a single cup of ice is just WILD behavior. Secondly, she goes to grab a cup, but doesn’t grab milk or cold creamer. Nothing. So whatever she is using to add/mix has been sitting on the table since before she left…most likely not anything cold that needs to be refrigerated… 


She pours her coffee into her cup (the color is light so it’s likely already mixed with milk or creamer) .. then adds something.. you hear her put the cap back on whatever she used. Doesn’t sound like a milk jug cap being put on and the creamers she normally uses usually have flip tops.. she puts the lid on and sips and you can tell by the color through the straw that it isn’t just black coffee (thought you were out of milk Lori🤔)Then the best part. She sets her cup down and has this look on her face like “oh well.. fuck it.” And proceeds to top off her cup with a liquid you clearly hear being poured into her cup. Then she puts the cap back on the bottle and sets it to the side. That’s when you can hear that it’s a glass bottle. Milk and creamer don’t come in glass bottles. So I’m going to assume that’s her alcohol she’s adding…some type of liquor. Listen and see what you think but this is what I got from it. Her facial expression said a lot in itself.

1katert,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1katert/does_the_electactic_ice91122_countertop_ice_maker/,Does the Electactic ICE91122 Countertop Ice Maker Live Up to the Hype Review?,"Testing the Electactic ICE91122 Ice Maker Countertop, I was honestly surprised by how much it claimed to offer. As someone who has constant gatherings at home, an efficient and portable ice maker seemed heaven-sent. The Electactic ICE91122 is compact yet promises high efficiency and self-cleaning capabilities. After using it for a while, here's what I discovered.

**Compact Design and Portability**  
This ice maker is incredibly portable, measuring just 11.57 x 8.74 x 11.42 inches and weighing 13.97 pounds. Carrying it around is easy, and I found it perfect for shifting between my kitchen and patio during parties. It’s smaller than I anticipated but doesn’t feel flimsy or cheap. There’s even a visible window at the top, which lets you peek in to check the ice-making progress without opening it unnecessarily. A useful addition for someone like me who tends to hover around appliances when trying them for the first time!

**High Efficiency—But Does It Deliver?**  
The product description boasts that this machine can churn out nine pieces of ice in just eight minutes, producing up to 26.6 pounds a day. These figures seemed enticing, but in reality, the performance slightly fluctuated. On a hot day with a higher ambient temperature, the speed dropped a bit; it took over ten minutes to hit those nine cubes. Still, its ability to keep up during my cousin’s birthday party was impressive—it delivered steady batches of ice even when we used it constantly throughout the evening.

**Ease of Use with a Two-Step Process**  
The simplicity of this machine might be its best feature. There’s no complex setup involved. Fill the 1.5-liter water tank, press the button, and you’re good to go. Even my technologically challenged grandmother could figure it out without any coaching from me. It is user-friendly to the point where you don’t even need to glance at the instructions after your first try. However, I noticed the water tank needs more frequent refilling if you’re using it heavily, which can be slightly inconvenient during events.

[Check Electactic ICE91122 price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0cwq5b71r/)

**Creative Ice Cube Shape and Versatility**  
Ice enthusiasts (because that’s a thing, right?) will appreciate the design here. The machine produces round, bullet-shaped ice cubes instead of the traditional square ones. This small detail has a real functional advantage—they melt slower, keeping drinks colder for longer. It’s especially useful for cocktails and iced coffees, as the uniform cubes cool beverages quickly without watering them down too fast. My partner loved this feature when we used these cubes to make margaritas during a movie night.

**Self-Cleaning Functionality**  
Self-cleaning appliances are an underrated blessing, and this feature didn’t disappoint. After a weekend of frequent use, I tried the self-cleaning setting, which worked like a charm. With just the press of a button, the machine flushed out residual water and impurities, saving me from the dreaded task of scrubbing tiny crevices. However, I recommend performing the cleaning cycle periodically to avoid any unpleasant smells over time.

**Pluses**  
- Highly portable for different occasions.  
- User-friendly with a simple two-step process.  
- Produces slower-melting, round ice cubes.  
- Effective self-cleaning feature.  

**Flaws**  
- Performance slows down in higher ambient temperatures.  
- Water tank could have a larger capacity.  
- Noisy at times, especially during peak production.

**Direct Competitors**  
While testing this countertop ice maker, I compared it with similar models like the Euhomy Countertop Ice Maker and the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker. The Euhomy model is similarly priced and efficient, but it lacks the self-cleaning option that’s such a highlight here. On the other hand, the GE model offers nugget-style ice and integrates smart app features to monitor production remotely, but it’s significantly bulkier and priced much higher. In the realm of convenience, portability, and affordability, the Electactic ICE91122 strikes a good balance, though the larger water tank on the Euhomy is tempting.  

**Budget-Friendly**  
Given its features and reasonably small footprint, this ice maker feels worth the investment for what it offers. Comparable products often lack self-cleaning functionality at this price point or have smaller production capacity. While it’s not perfect—what appliance is?—it caters to a sweet spot between value and functionality. For my needs, especially with frequent medium-sized gatherings, it made financial sense to avoid larger, more expensive machines.

The pots I bought don’t have the exact size it was initially in - and the next size up is too big so I went for the one below that which is slightly smaller than my original pot. The roots are very few so I thought it’d be okay. 

Anyway, I made my soil mixture which contains,  well soil (all purpose soil, see pic), perlite, and orchid mix (miracle gro). 

All looked good until I stuff it in the pot and poured water. I saw people would just put lots of water and let it drain? So I did the same. Please tell me why nothing came out and it started to overflow?!!!! As its see through I was able to see that the water was still travelling down. However,  even after it started dripping (very little at a time), it had the consistency of oats porridge and the water was just sitting on top to the point I had to tip it out. The picture shows what it looks like after I’ve tipped it out and it’s dried a little.

I’ve no idea what to do. No time to do anything today but don’t want to kill my plant. Anyway suggestions? I’m new and don’t have the best mental health atm so not sure I can handle going full out right now, buying all sorts etc - I just want to pot my plant and feel happy I did something today. Please can someone help?",0,1745946866.0,houseplants,1,0.5,False
1katcft,https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/comments/1katcft/if_you_dont_ask_the_answer_is_always_no/,"If you don't ask, the answer is always no","I'd like to share what I think is the most obvious and most immediately usable piece of advice for anyone who's struggling with dating. I've been using a variation of this quote (if you don't ask, you don't date) for a long time without knowing the source. Apparently, an author named Nora Roberts said:

***""If you don't go after what you want, you'll never have it. If you don't ask, the answer is always no. If you don't step forward, you're always in the same place.""***

I think it's an excellent quote that crystallizes one of the biggest issues about inceldom: guys being unwilling to go out to socialize more and ask girls out. Most of the time, their reasons are:

1. Fear of rejection
2. Not wanting to be seen as a creep
3. Insecurities about appearance/height
4. Worrying about what they might say

A lot of you will probably dislike the reality check of what I'm about to say and I apologize if it sounds rough - ***none of these reasons are real or valid.***

These reasons are excuses designed to mask the underlying unwillingness to make an effort. Dating is difficult, after all, rejection sucks, handsome/tall guys have it easier, girls are not interested in ugly guys, etc. - *by saying all these things, you're giving yourself ready excuses as to why you haven't really tried going out and meeting more people*.

The fact is, regular people just like me and you make up the vast majority of the population. Regular people regularly get married and have kids. Contrary to what you may believe, conventionally handsome/6ft guys are the minority. There are very few of them so it's not possible that they're the only ones getting dates. That means you aren't incapable of getting a date - if my 5'5"" neighbor can do it, so can you.

So what exactly is the difference between those regular guys dating and you? *It's not the looks. It's not the hair. It's not the jawline. It's not your clothes.*

***They go out. They meet people. They ask.***

***They make an effort.***

The next question is usually ""how do I ask?""

I found this old article from Forbes about 7 keys to asking. I know that it's a very old article, it's about business, the topic is not about dating itself, and it's not exactly dating advice. However, upon reading the tips, I realized that they can really be applied to helping you in asking people out and interacting with people in general. I'll explain how below but it's an interesting read nonetheless. Here's the article:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/margiewarrell/2013/04/24/7-keys-to-asking-for-what-you-really-want-so-you-get-it/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/margiewarrell/2013/04/24/7-keys-to-asking-for-what-you-really-want-so-you-get-it/)

**1. Don't assume others are mind readers** \- all of the excuses guys use as to why they don't ask people out can be boiled down to overthinking. Fear of rejection, not wanting to be seen as a creep, insecurities about appearance, worrying about what they might say -- all of these things are results of guys trying to read minds and extrapolating what each little sign might mean. Instead, *remember that you can't read minds and neither can they*. That means you're not a creep and you don't know if they're interested or not. *The only way to know is to ask.*

**2. Be bold in what you ask for (don't dilute)** \- *confidence is key*. You can track down any advice on dating and it will always boil down to being self-confident and being comfortable with who you are. You won't always get a yes but you will definitely improve your chances by asking more boldly, stating what you want clearly, and not making yourself look small. When you attend a group event, no one will approach you if you slink away in a corner looking like you don't want to be there.

**3. Be specific about what you want and when you want it** \- people are far more likely to agree if you're specific because it makes you sound more like you know what you're doing and you know what you're there for. ""hey, want to have coffee after <insert activity> at <insert shop>? They have amazing <insert product> and great service."" definitely sounds much better than ""do you want to hang out?"" The former shows you've thought this through despite the casual setting; the latter shows uncertainty.

**4. Be clear about what you won't tolerate** \- have boundaries. It's important that you don't make yourself out to be a doormat people can just walk all over. If you aren't into certain things, say so. If you aren't into certain behaviors, say so. I've encountered many guys here who were bullied and insulted and it kept happening because they didn't want to be cast out or lose connections. In truth, by establishing boundaries, you present yourself as a more confident and more well-put-together person.

**5. Forget hints - be direct** \- this might be an unpopular opinion but I don't believe in hints at all. Like I said, *you are not a mind reader and neither is she*. Her hair flip, looking at her watch, mismatched shoes, yawning, eye contact (or lack thereof), smile, etc. can be read in many different ways and looking into them is a waste of time. Instead, just ask and just say what you want. ""Did you like the movie"", ""Are you having fun"", ""Did you enjoy yourself"", ""Do you want to go out again"", ""I had a lot of fun tonight"", ""I really enjoyed your company"", ""I'd like to do this again"", etc. Just go for it. You lose nothing.

**6. Ditch the martyr act** \- your needs matter. Period. Your desires, happiness, wants, crushes, feelings, etc. all matter. Many guys on here talk about how they feel disgusted with themselves for wanting a girl or fantasizing about her; it's stupid. You are equally a human being and so it's completely fine to want someone. If the 6ft jock can ask her out, so can you. Behaving like you're not worthy or you're less of a person just because of your attributes is not doing you any favors. *Remember, neither of you are mind readers.* You want to talk to her? Do it. She won't bite.

**7. Don't make 'no' mean more than it does** \- perhaps the most important tip on the list. You need to understand that you won't always get what you want. You will be rejected. Some girls will not like you. Some girls might be busy. Some girls might be emotionally unready for dating. Some girls might not be into your style. Whatever the reason, take it and move on. Everyone gets rejected. The key is to dust yourself off quickly and move on. If she says 'no', it's not personal. Her preferences matter just like yours do. *So if she isn't into you, it's not her fault and it's not your fault.* You just need to accept that.

If you made it all the way here, thank you for reading. I give advice straight and direct and some of you don't like it but that's just my style. I prefer you hear the truth so you can do something about it. If you're currently not going out much, not approaching girls at all, not asking any girls out, asking only once or twice a month, then I implore you to re-evaluate your strategy. *You need to be going out way more, interacting with more people, and asking them out more.*

***You're the one who wants to date.*** So you're supposed to be the one to do something about it. If you're the one who's hungry, you're the one who's supposed to order. If you're the one who's sick, you're the one who's supposed to call a doctor. They're not going to be the ones to approach you if you're in a corner feeling sorry for yourself. They're not going to care or even notice your focus on jawlines or haircuts if you're not meeting them in the first place.

***Waiting around for a woman to fall onto your lap while laying around at home is a complete waste of time.***

Just ask. The worst thing she can say is 'no'. Then you can just ask someone else.",4,1745946851.0,IncelExit,4,0.75,False

**Hot coffee and asymmetrical power**

Do you remember the McDonalds hot coffee case? A woman sued McDonalds after she spilt coffee on her lap after ordering at a drive through. People scoffed, assuming she was just trying to get a huge payout over a minor inconvenience that was really her own fault. News outlets reported it as frivolous litigation and TV pundits talked about the US becoming a tortious wonderland. 

In reality, the woman had sustained third degree burns, required skin grafting, was hospitalised for over a week, disabled for years, and had to undergo several years of treatment. She originally only asked McDonalds to cover her medical expenses ($20k) but they refused. 

Discovery revealed that McDonalds *knew* its coffee was hot enough to seriously injure people. They had received 700+ other complaints and settled some of them for up to half a million dollars. They required their franchises to serve it at that temperature for a few reasons, one being that it knew some people were taking drive-through coffee to another destination, so if McDonalds served it too hot, the coffee would be the right temperature when those people arrived. It was a cost-benefit analysis, similar to how Ford decided that instead of recalling the Pinto (which it knew had defective fuel tanks), it would be cheaper to just pay out the families of people who died.

The McDonald case eventually settled out of court.

  
**How it applies to Blake and Justin** 

The power differential between the Lively and Wayfarer parties reminds me of the McDonalds case. 

People had/have misconceptions about the coffee case because McDonalds has titanic PR budgets while the woman was probably bound by a confidentiality clause in the settlement.

The fact that Blake and Ryan have been able to swan about and be media darlings at all these recent events (her premiere, his football matches) tell me that if this settles, they're going to bounce back just fine. Whereas Justin's career is basically over. Those of us here will remember the broad outlines of the case (even if we don't find out the full story) but the majority of the public will never know or will be fed a revised version by Blake and Ryan's PR teams. I think the average person viewing her Time speech sees her as a victim-survivor of SA (worse than her actual legal claim of SH) and Baldoni as the aggressor by implication.

[Part 1],"Back in the day, in my small town, there was a lot of talk and speculation about a website called deadlinks.com. The weird thing about this site was that you couldn’t access it directly.  Typing the URL into a browser wouldn’t lead you anywhere—no error message, no loading screen, just nothing. The only way in was through a dead link.

Some broken hyperlink buried in an old forum, a forgotten webpage, or an expired ad that shouldn’t have worked. Click the wrong thing at the wrong time, and suddenly, you’d find yourself there. The site itself was empty. Just a black background, with a blank text box, and a single question written beneath it:

“*What is your name?*”

When I was in middle school, kids speculated about what happened if you put your name in. Some said you’d be cursed and die in seven days. Others swore it was some kind of alien signal, or a government experiment watching you through the screen. All the “theories” were just bits and pieces stolen from horror movies. Other kids bragged about not being scared, claiming they’d do it. But the next day, they always had excuses. ""My WiFi went out"" or ""my computer froze."" Every time, something stopped them.

I don’t remember if anyone actually put their name in. But if they did, I never heard about it. Like many urban legends, the site faded into obscurity, slowly leaving people’s memories. A relic of an older internet—forgotten, lost, left to collect malware.



*discord ping*

SleepyBoi420 (Derek): Hey, you guys remember that weird website kids would talk about back in middle school?

OopsAllParanoia (Me): That was like 10 years ago bro.

404HumorNotFound (Ryan): yeah there were hundreds of websites talked about back then 

SleepyBoi420: DEADLINKS GUYS!! Remember the one you had to be redirected to!

OopsAllParanoia: Ohhhh yeah, the one that asked your name right?

404HumorNotFound: what about it Derek?

SleepyBoi420: I got to the site!

404HumorNotFound: oh no

SleepyBoi420: 404BallsNotFound

404HumorNotFound: you’re a dumbass...

OopsAllParanoia: Just put your first name bro. How many Ryans are out there?

404HumorNotFound: i guess…

SleepyBoi420: Let’s goooooo! 

SleepyBoi420: Ok, let’s all hop on a call and do it at the same time

""Okay! You guys ready?!"" Derek said with enough excitement for all of us. ""I'm good to go,"" I said. ""Let's just get this over with,"" Ryan mumbled. ""On the count of three, we press enter,"" Derek instructed. Ryan let out a heavy, reluctant sigh but agreed.

""Three.""

I sat at my computer, staring at the screen. Rereading ""*What is your name?*"" over and over.

""Two.""

I quickly typed Mark into the text box.

""One.""

I hit enter.

The box vanished. 

The words ""*Thank you, Damon.*"" took its place.

I sat there puzzled—

How did it know my real name?

""Yo, all I got was this stupid ‘*Thank you, Ryan*’ message. Was something supposed to happen, Derek?"" Ryan asked, annoyed. ""Ye-yeah, same here... ummmm, I don’t know..."" Derek's voice wavered slightly. “You guys I need to let you know some—”

""Welp! I'm just gonna go watch some YouTube and go to bed. See ya!"" Derek cut me off abruptly. 

A second later, he left the call.

“What were you saying Damon?” Ryan asked. “It… it’s nothing…” I decided not to tell him what happened. Ryan and I sat in silence for a moment. Neither of us wanted to admit that something felt off. ""Soooo… I’m gonna go to bed too,"" Ryan finally said. I agreed. We both left the call. But as I stared at my screen, those words still lingered in my head.

“*Thank you, Damon.*”

At around 1:30 in the morning, I woke up to my phone exploding with messages from a frantic Derek.

SleepyBoi420: Guys!

SleepyBoi420: GUYS!!!

SleepyBoi420: Please this is serious!

SleepyBoi420: RYAN!!!

OopsAllParanoia: Why are you going crazy bro? I was sleeping.

404HumorNotFound: same here, this better be good, Derek

SleepyBoi420: Ok ok, so I clicked my YouTube bookmark right, and the deadlinks website popped up with this message

“*A site so old, yet still alive. A single box, a single plea. Enter your name, a message waits. You close the tab, but it's too late. We know your name, Derek.*”

Honestly, I wouldn't have thought twice about it, but every other website I went to had the same message

OopsAllParanoia: Ok… sounds like just some dumb cryptic poem meant to scare you.

SleepyBoi420: Sure, but the thing is, I didn’t even put my name in

404HumorNotFound: YOU SON OF A BITCH!! This was your idea and you didn’t even put your name in?!

SleepyBoi420: I’m sorry!! 

SleepyBoi420: But I don’t know why you’re so mad. You don’t even believe it!

404HumorNotFound: I DON’T! But damn man, what if something did happen? You were just going to leave me and Damon hanging?

SleepyBoi420: I’m sorry man…

OopsAllParanoia: Look, why don’t we just calm down and sleep this off guys? Besides the weird message Derek got, nothing has harmed us. Let’s just call it a night.

404HumorNotFound: fine… goodnight Damon

OopsAllParanoia: Goodnight man

SleepyBoi420: Goodnight Ryan

. . .

SleepyBoi420: ...

OopsAllParanoia: Don’t worry about it D, I’m sure Ryan will be over it by tomorrow.

SleepyBoi420: Yeah, you’re right… Goodnight Damon

OopsAllParanoia: Goodnight bro.

I laid down to go to sleep, but the whole experience kept circling around in my head. There’s no way this stupid website could know who we are… right? ""Whatever, I should just forget about this whole stupid night,"" I muttered, trying to reassure myself.

I woke up to my phone alarm blaring at 9 AM. I had forgotten to turn it off thanks to Derek’s shenanigans last night. Groggily, I peeled myself from the bed’s warm embrace, fighting against the invisible arms that tried to pull me back under. By sheer will, I forced myself up and trudged to the bathroom. A cold shower was my first line of defense against exhaustion, jolting me awake before I gradually turned up the heat. Steam filled the room, fogging up the mirror. After stepping out, I wiped it down to brush my teeth. 

That’s when I noticed something was off.

Every forward brushstroke I made was echoed in the mirror with a strange, unnatural delay. My reflection didn’t follow smoothly—it hesitated, lagging, like a fish caught on a taut line. “There’s no way a mirror can lag, right?” I muttered, staring at myself. 

Must be more tired than I thought.

Shaking it off, I decided to clear my head and put last night behind me by treating myself to my favorite coffee spot.

Standing in line, I lazily scanned the menu. This place, like many others, switched to displaying the menu on a TV screen. While I was looking for what sounded good to me, the items disappeared and the screen flashed the words:

""*Thank you, Damon.*""

I blinked and looked around. No one reacted. Customers shuffled forward, heads buried in their phones or in conversations. When I looked back, the menu was normal again. Lack of sleep. Had to be.

I shrugged it off, stepped up, and ordered my usual, giving my name as always. Then I waited. Five minutes. Ten. Names were called—people before and after me—yet mine never came. “Maybe they just missed me,” I thought, walking up to check. My order was there, but instead of Damon, the receipt read: David. I vaguely remembered hearing David get called a few minutes ago, but no one had claimed it. The items were exactly what I ordered, so… close enough I guess. Coffee shops screw up names all the time. 

Grabbing my food, I headed to the park, finding a quiet spot to enjoy my breakfast.

The scenery was gorgeous. California in December meant clear blue skies, lush green trees, and that perfect bite of cold where a hoodie was just enough. The park was unusually quiet for a Saturday. It was ten a.m., and the park was nearly empty—not that I minded. I saw that as a win. 

Just a handful of people loitered around. 

A mother sat on a bench by the playground, glued to her phone, a stroller parked beside her. For a moment, I felt the flicker of something crawl up from the back of my mind—old, heavy memories I’d spent years trying not to unpack. 

I thought of my own mother. The way she used to sit at the kitchen table, half-listening while scrolling through her old beat-up phone. But I shut it down before the thought could finish, like slamming a door on a room I never wanted to open. I darted my eyes around looking for anything to distract me when I noticed a little girl clambering around the jungle gym, though ‘playing’ felt like the wrong word—she moved like she was following a script only she could see. 

I heard the faint crunch of dried grass underfoot. Behind me, about sixty feet away, was a guy in a hoodie, pacing back and forth across the grass in unnaturally long strides. Not jogging. Not speed-walking. 

Just… striding. 

His movements were exaggerated, walking like he didn’t know how his legs worked. It looked insane, but hey, he wasn’t bothering anyone, so I mentally filed him under ‘park weirdo’ and moved on. I sat for about half an hour, enjoying my breakfast, when something started gnawing at me. A wrongness. 

Nobody had come or gone in the entire time I’d been sitting there. 

The striding weirdo never stopped. Never changed pace. The longer I watched him, the more I realized something was off. His hoodie sagged unnaturally low on his body, the sleeves dragging through the grass like limp, empty arms. His legs were freakishly long, yet somehow, he was short. The proportions were all wrong, like someone had cranked up the leg slider in a character creator but forgot to adjust the rest. With the oversized hoodie swallowing his torso.

He didn’t even look like a person—just a head bobbing atop a pair of legs. 

The little girl on the playground, every so often, she’d stop moving entirely, turning her head just to look at me. Just staring. I gave her a small wave, trying to play it off. She didn’t wave back. She didn’t even react. Just kept staring, like a little NPC waiting for me to press the right button. “Kids just do weird shit sometimes,” I told myself. But the words felt less like reassurance and more like a desperate plea to believe that this was still normal.

The mother never looked up from her phone.

Not once.

Not even to check on what I assumed was her kid. She sat too still—too rigid. Almost like a mannequin propped up on the bench. I glanced at the stroller beside her. No rustling. No shifting. Just stillness. Too still. I worked up the courage to approach the young mother. A prickling unease slithered up my spine. Something about this felt off. I swallowed hard and stepped closer. She didn’t react. Didn’t shift. Didn’t even acknowledge me at all. Her daughter still stood in the playground, utterly motionless. Eyes locked onto me, unblinking. “Hi…” My voice came out quieter than I intended. The mother didn’t move. “Um, I—"" I stopped. Realizing she wasn't moving. Not blinking. Not twitching. She wasn't even breathing. My eyes drifted down to her hands. That’s when I noticed. The screen on her phone wasn’t even on.

The stroller jolted.

Something shot out. I barely had time to register it before it vanished into the brush. I turned back to the mother and—

She was gone.

The bench sat empty. I turned to the playground and the creepy little girl was gone too. The stroller sat there, perfectly still, as if no one had ever been there at all.

Trying to get away from the weird shit going on at that park, I decided to go to the mall. It’s the weekend. There had to be tons of people there. I drove to the mall. The roads were busy, cars passing like usual, but when I pulled into the parking lot, my stomach dropped.

It was completely empty.

Not just sparse—vacant.

I sat in my car, gripping the wheel, watching the road. Cars kept driving past, not a single one turning in. It was like the mall didn’t even exist to them. Then, finally, I saw a car pull in. I exhaled, relieved—until I noticed something wrong. As it pulled in, it disappeared, like it was sinking into an invisible void. The back bumper was the last thing to vanish, swallowed as if it had driven behind a mirror. I blinked and rubbed my eyes. The lot was still empty. I turned my attention to the mall entrance. Watching. Waiting. 

Five minutes. Nothing. Another five. No one walked in. No one walked out. Every instinct told me to leave. But I had to know. I got out of the car and walked up to the automatic doors. They slid open instantly and I was greeted with generic pop music. I stepped inside.

It was noon on a Saturday. Almost Christmas. This place should be packed. But it was completely empty. I wandered through the barren halls. Stores were open, fully stocked, yet there were no employees. No shoppers. The lights were on. Registers were running but, it looked as if everyone had just stepped away. “Am I being pranked or something?” I muttered under my breath. A thought crossed my mind—”if no one was here, what's stopping me from taking something?” 

I shut that thought down immediately.

Still, with no one around, I felt… wrong. Like I was trespassing somewhere I shouldn’t be. It took me entirely too long to realize that the music had changed.  The cookie cutter pop music was replaced with a droning piano melody—thin, stretched, and off-key. Like an old record player dying mid-spin. While I made my way through the empty lobby of the mall I heard something that made goosebumps erupt along my arms.

Footsteps.

Not the light tap of sneakers. Not dress shoes clicking against tile. It was bare feet slapping the floor. A guttural growl echoed from somewhere deep down the corridor. Low. Rumbling. I darted into the nearest open store, knocking over a display case in my rush. It hit the floor with a shattering crash. 

Shit. 

No time to worry about that. I needed to hide. I had bolted into a women’s clothing store so naturally I started towards the dressing room. ""No—idiot, that's way too obvious,"" I thought, silently roasting myself. Then, my eyes landed on a pink door at the back of the store. 

An employee’s section.

I sprinted toward it and grabbed the handle. It turned. I threw myself inside into a long, dimly lit hallway that stretched endlessly in both directions. Behind me, I heard it—the crunch of glass. My stomach twisted.

It was inside the store. 

There was no time to make a choice. Instincts took over and I darted to the right. The hallway seemed endless and it felt like I had been running for the past ten minutes, my heart pounding. ""This doesn’t make sense. The mall isn’t this big."" I thought. Suddenly, I slid to a stop. A figure stood ahead of me. A dark silhouette with long black hair. It was standing still. Motionless. My chest seized with pure, cold terror. Behind it…

The pink door.

The same one I had used to enter the hallway. I had been running straight. But I ended up back where I started?? The figure stepped forward. I turned around but this time, I searched frantically for any door. Anything I might have missed. Between the sound of my own racing footsteps, I heard it. Slow. Heavy. Steps.

It was following me.

Not chasing. Just following. Like it thought there was no escape for me. My confusion deepened when I saw that the hallway now ended in a solid wall, with only a single door. I didn’t hesitate. The door shattered open under my weight, the world spinning around me as I stumbled forward—and into darkness.

The air was cold. Crisp. I was outside. But something was wrong. I had only been inside for an hour. Two at most. But the sky above me was a deep, suffocating black. It was night. I looked back and the door was gone. I couldn't wrap my head around what was going on. I just knew I needed to get the hell out of here right now.

I scanned the parking lot. My car was sitting just a few yards away. Untouched. Sitting right where I left it. I staggered toward it, exhausted, every inch of me screaming to just get inside and leave. I flew out of the parking lot. Driving well past the speed limit, replaying the bizarre events of the day over and over in my head. The lagging mirror while brushing my teeth. The striding weirdo, the silent little girl, the still woman and the empty mall. It all felt… wrong, like puzzle pieces that didn’t quite fit together. The streetlights cast long, unnatural shadows as I pulled out onto the road. It was just past eleven p.m. and the streets were just an endless stretch of asphalt swallowed by darkness. 

My hands gripped the steering wheel, the hum of the engine and the occasional flicker of passing streetlights were the only things keeping me company. I glanced in the rearview mirror to check if the mall was still behind me—and for just a split second, I saw something. A shape—small, barely noticeable—the very top of a head peeking up from the backseat.

I sucked in a breath, my pulse hammering against my ribs. My grip on the wheel tightened as I forced myself to keep my eyes on the road. I must have imagined it. A trick of the light, or maybe the exhaustion was starting to play with my head.

But I had seen something.

I stole another glance.

Nothing.

Another.

Still nothing.

I kept flicking my gaze between the road and the mirror, waiting for movement, waiting for something to change. With each glance, my nerves wound tighter and tighter, expecting—no, dreading—a face to rise up behind me. After glancing what felt like twenty times, relief. Nothing was there. I exhaled, letting out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. My muscles uncoiled slightly, my heartbeat slowing to a steadier rhythm. “See? Just my imagination.” I said to reassure myself.

The empty road stretched ahead, and as I reached for the turn signal, getting ready to merge right. I glanced at my side mirror and from the corner of my eye, something wasn’t right. It took a second for my brain to process it. The faint glint of pale skin. The curvature of fingers. Long, blood red fingers. Wrapped around the headrest of my passenger seat. My breath caught, my whole body going rigid. Slowly—so painfully slowly—I turned my head just a little more. Staring back just inches from me—

A face.

A hollow, sunken thing. Its eyes were wide, unblinking, black pits that seemed to swallow the light. Its skin was pulled too tight over its skull, stretched thin and sickly pale, the texture like something long dead. Its mouth was too wide, too sharp, curling into something that wasn’t quite a smile. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t move. It just stared. And then—

It grinned.

I slammed the brakes so hard I almost spun out. I veered to the side of the road, heart pounding against my ribs. I threw the door open and scrambled out. I swallowed hard, gripping the edge of the car trying to catch my breath. My pulse throbbed in my ears. 

I looked back into my driver side window and it was gone. I peered through the backseat window—nothing. Just to be sure, I popped the trunk—empty. That thing—whatever it was, was gone. Maybe I was just on edge. Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me. I forced myself back into the driver’s seat, gripping the wheel tight. I looked back over my shoulders.

Nothing.

I needed to get home. Now. As I pulled back onto the road, I couldn’t shake the feeling that, somewhere in the darkness behind me, something was still there. Still watching. I drove home with my doors unlocked. I pulled into my driveway, heart pounding. As soon as I put the car in park, I yanked the keys out, threw the door open, and slammed it shut behind me. My hands fumbled to lock it—hopefully trapping whatever the hell might’ve been in there inside.

The night felt heavier now, the air thick. I turned toward my house. It was completely dark. Not a single light on. I opened the door. I needed light. Now. I flicked the switch by the door.

Nothing.

“Oh, fuck no!” I said out loud. The power company never sent out a blackout notice. This wasn’t normal. The breaker maybe? I turned on my phone’s flashlight and stepped back outside. My house was old, and for whatever reason, the breaker box was mounted on the side. As I walked past my car, I hesitated, glancing through the windshield. The backseat was empty. But that didn’t make me feel any better.

I forced myself to keep moving, pushing through the wooden gate that led to the narrow alley between my house and my neighbor’s towering brick fence. The darkness stretched forever, the alley feeling twice as long as I knew it was. Every tiny noise made me paranoid—rustling leaves, twigs snapping. It’s probably just a small animal. 

Yeah that’s it.

When I found the breaker. My heart sank to my knees. The door to the breaker was wide open and the switch had been flipped off.

Someone did this.

I slammed it back on and tore through the alley, through the gate, up the porch steps, and into my house, slamming the door shut behind me. I locked it, my breath ragged. The sound of a rapid, scratching patter flew across my kitchen floor behind me. My blood ran cold. It sounded like a dog—long nails clicking against the wood.

But I didn’t have a dog.

""…If it was a dog, wasn’t that better than the alternative?"" I thought, trying to reassure myself. Swallowing hard, I forced my legs to move. Step by step, I crept toward the kitchen, my hand trembling as I reached for the switch.

The lights flickered on.

The room was empty. No dog. No person. Nothing. But somehow… somehow, it felt worse than before. I ignored the unease clawing at my gut and made my way upstairs, flicking on every light as I went. The brightness should have been comforting. It wasn’t. The shadows felt like they were watching.

I sat at my desk, flipped open my laptop, and signed in.

*discord ping*

SleepyBoi420: Hey Damon, have you heard from Ryan at all today?

OopsAllParanoia: Nah, he hasn’t hit me up yet. I take it you guys haven’t made up then?

SleepyBoi420: No… I sent him a bunch of messages apologizing, but he never replied. In fact, I don’t think he even got on today.

OopsAllParanoia: Well, let’s hop in a call. Maybe he’ll pick up.

SleepyBoi420: Sure…

The group call rang. 

Ryan’s profile was grayed out as Derek and I sat in silence, waiting. He didn’t answer. I went to message him when I saw him enter the call. I exhaled. “There he is.”

“Hey Ryan, where have you been, man?” Derek asked.

. . .

Derek hesitated. “Ry—” A sound cut him off. A deep, inhuman rasping breath. Static crackled through the speakers. ""Wh… where…"" The distortion twisted, wet and wrong. ""Ha… have…"" A thick, gurgling noise seeped through, like something too large, too heavy was shifting against the mic. ""…y… you…"" My throat tightened. “Ryan, what are you doing?”

“Yeah, that’s not fucking funny, bro!” Derek barked.

No response. Just guttural, sucking gasps, like something was trying to form words but didn’t have the right mouth for it. “Okay, Ryan, you can stop now…” I muttered. The static surged—then cut out.

Silence.

""Okay, Ryan, you can stop now."" My own voice said back to us. It wasn’t an echo. It wasn’t a replay. It was off. Like something was trying on my voice like a new coat. A chill lanced through my spine. I saw Derek leave the call.  I tried to leave too but the button wouldn’t work. ""How the hell did he leave?"" I thought, my stomach knotting. My laptop screen flickered.  

Without any warning—my webcam switched on.

Cold panic gripped me. I didn’t think—I just slammed my laptop shut. My hands were shaking. ""Okay, okay… the screen is shut. It should go to sleep in a few seconds."" The speakers crackled.

My own voice spilled out into the room.

""Damon… where are you… Damon… where are you… Damon… where are you…"" I yanked the charger from my laptop, flipped it over and took out the battery. The voice didn't stop. My heart pounded and as I turned to leave the room—

My phone rang.

The sound nearly made me jump out of my skin. My ringtone blasted at full volume. I fumbled for my phone. Derek. I answered immediately. “Dude, are you good? What’s going on?” My voice was frantic, breathless. Derek’s voice was quiet. Shaky. “Damon…”

He paused.

Then he said, barely above a whisper—“There’s something in my closet.” My blood ran cold. “What are you talking about?” I asked frantically. “Laughing… it’s laughing in my closet…” His voice wavered, as if he were on the verge of tears.

And then I heard it.

A low, wheezy chuckle filtered through the call. The sound was unnatural—wet and ragged, like a chain-smoker exhaling through shredded lungs. Derek’s voice broke through, barely holding steady. “Damon… what do I do?” His words were small, scared. I opened my mouth to answer, forcing down the rising panic. “You need to get ou—”

The call ended abruptly.

I tried calling him back—once, twice, five times. Voicemail, every time. My heart started pounding as my brain clawed through possible scenarios—maybe he dropped the phone running; maybe the thing had cornered him; maybe he was already...

That’s when I realized—

The voice from my laptop was growing louder. More distorted and warped. The speakers crackled like they were about to blow out—

The voice stopped.

After waiting a few minutes I slowly lifted my laptop screen. I was greeted by the same phrase I’ve seen since last night…

“*Thank you, Damon.*”

I barely had time to breathe before—the lights went out. I reached for my lamp. Nothing. ""Oh no… please don’t be the breaker again. Not right now."" I muttered. I stepped towards the door, fumbling in the darkness. My fingers brushed the handle. From the other side of the door I heard—

""Damon… I found you.""

It was my voice, muffled behind the closed door. Every muscle in my body locked. The door creaked open. It stopped, just slightly ajar. Just enough for me to see a familiar face.

The face from my car. This time just a few short inches away.

Grinning. A too-wide, too-sharp, toothy grin.

And this time, it didn’t disappear.

Local Guide level 7, approx 150 detailled reviews at the moment.

I stayed recently 3 months at an amazing hotel for holidays.
I want to publish a review, everytime I publish the review, it’s blocked immediately. All 24 photos are in status ""waiting to import"" after many days, contact help center, still nothing new. No answer.
I don’t understand what can be wrong.

Here is my review down below traduced from french language , what do you think. 
Thank you in advance

Review :
I stayed at this hotel for a very long three months.
I booked online, and used the hotel's transportation service to pick me up from the airport.
My family appreciated the spacious vehicle that took us directly to the hotel (a 10-minute drive).

The reception and check-in went very well, with a welcome cocktail and clear explanations of the hotel and its operations. I paid by credit card.
We were escorted to our rooms by the porter and our suitcases.

I had a Deluxe Double Room with a city view.
The room is spacious, the shower and toilet work very well, the water pressure is strong, the air conditioning is brand new, it works perfectly without being noisy, a safe is available, and there is a mini fridge without a freezer, but reception can store items in a freezer if needed.  The mattress and pillows are comfortable, I appreciated the desk for working comfortably. The room is very bright, which is very pleasant.
The decor is modern and minimalist, a very European style, and it offers all the comforts of home. Room service is available.
The soundproofing in the rooms is adequate, although you can sometimes hear the loudest ones.
The hotel offers laundry service for our laundry. It smells good, is clean, and ironed, which is very much appreciated.

Breakfast is very good, with a wide variety of choices. I liked having my fried eggs every morning with Asian soup. The pastries are very good; they come from a renowned French café called ""La Terrasse,"" located across the street. The fruit is fresh and changes daily.
The room is clean and air-conditioned; it meets my needs for a good breakfast to start the day.  A special mention goes to the coffee bar, which makes sublime coffees upon request using real bean-to-cup machines. A real taste experience.

The pool on the top floor of the hotel is superb, a decent length for swimming laps every morning, and the view is perfect for sunsets.
The gym is simple, with dumbbells, a treadmill, a weight bench, and a bike. The room is air-conditioned.

During the day, the upstairs restaurant offers cocktails and everything you need for a great time by the pool.
In the evening, a singer plays live music on certain nights. It's very pleasant, and the food and service are perfect. It features international and Asian cuisine. A charming and intimate place.

The hotel's service is extremely professional and efficient, meeting all my needs during my stay, whether it be room service, breakfast, the restaurant, reception, management, or all other services. I lacked for nothing and appreciated their friendliness and kindness in every way. It is thanks to them that my stay was a success, although I was sometimes demanding and unpleasant.

In conclusion, this is an excellent hotel with good value for money. My main criteria are cleanliness and safety. It perfectly meets these requirements. English is easily understood, and there are no language barriers with transparent communication.
Its location is excellent; there are plenty of restaurants and cafes on the street, a laundromat across the street, a massage parlor a little further away, a traditional temple, the city center and its food market and night market are just a short walk away.
I highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a place to stay in Vientiane. It doesn't envy any other hotel. I felt friendliness, respect, and generosity, representing local culture very well.",1,1745946005.0,LocalGuides,0,1.0,False

The conversation flowed pretty well, we had a lot of similar interests, and hobbies. He was sweet and I liked him but I wasn’t feeling anything romantic necessarily. However I know sometimes chemistry takes time to build up and so I was open to going on a second date. We ended the date and he hugged me and said « we should hang out again » and I said yeah we should. I think I was a bit nonchalant in my energy because I really treated it as a casual get to know kind of date and was super chill because I wasn’t super attracted to him like how i usually am to my dates but wasn’t opposed to meeting again and seeing where it went. 2 days after the date. He didn’t text. I’m taking it for what it is and moving on but I’m really surprised since it was a good date nevertheless. Was I supposed to text him? Just gauging here as a future reference because I’ve found guys normally text when they’re interested and I’ve made the grave mistake of reversing roles in the past and it never landed well so now for me it’s a boundary I trying to maintain.

1kasw1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1kasw1z/can_vtopmart_food_storage_containers_truly/,Can Vtopmart Food Storage Containers Truly Organize Your Pantry? Honest Review Inside,"A neat and organized kitchen has always been a dream of mine, and the **Vtopmart 24 pcs Airtight Food Storage Containers** seemed like a practical solution to my chaos. The first thing that caught my eye was the promise of transforming a cluttered pantry into a structured haven. After using these containers for a few weeks, I feel I’ve gotten to know these food canisters better than some of my relatives. Naturally, there are some things to love and a few quirks worth discussing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the standout features of this product is the design. These containers come in a sleek, uniform look with a transparent body and black lids. The material feels sturdy yet light, and it's BPA-free, which gives me peace of mind when storing food. Having the ability to easily see the content through the clear plastic saves me from playing the guessing game every morning when I need cereal. Although I’ve dropped one or two out of clumsiness, they’ve managed to remain intact, living up to their claim of being shatterproof. The rectangular shape and stackable design make efficient use of my cabinet space, which is a boon for smaller kitchens.  

[Ready to buy Vtopmart 24pcs Airtight Food Storage Containers? See the Amazon deal here.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b08zk5wdwn/)  

**Airtight Sealing Performance**  
The airtight feature of these containers deserves applause. Each lid has a silicone gasket and side-locking mechanism that creates a tight seal, keeping food fresh much longer. I tested this with some sugar and flour, both of which stayed bone-dry even in humid conditions. The lids are interchangeable across all 24 containers, which simplifies things when assembling and cleaning—a detail small yet immensely helpful. However, I found that locking the lids required a firm press, which might be a slight inconvenience for anyone with weaker hands or arthritis.

**Variety of Sizes**  
This set doesn’t hold back when it comes to size options. With six tall containers (2.5 quarts), six large ones (1.8 quarts), six medium (1.5 quarts), and six small ones (0.7 quarts), I could store anything from spaghetti to nuts without running out of room. The tall containers easily accommodated long pasta, while the small ones were perfect for daily-use items like sugar or snacks. A small issue, though, was the capacity of some containers—if you’re someone who buys flour or rice in bulk, these might require you to divide them across multiple containers.  

**Positives**
- Stackable design maximizes cabinet space.  
- Durable and shatterproof material.  
- Airtight lids ensure food remains fresh.  
- BPA-free construction for a worry-free experience.

**Negatives**
- Locking mechanisms require considerable force to secure.  
- Not ideal for storing bulk quantities of certain items.  

**Ease of Use and Cleaning**  
As someone who despises extra chores, I appreciate how easy these containers are to clean. They’re dishwasher-safe, saving me time, although I tend to handwash them to prolong their life. The consistent lid sizes also simplify my post-cleaning effort since I don’t have to match lids to specific containers. However, I noticed that the lids, with their gaskets, take a little extra attention to clean thoroughly in the grooves.

**Usability for Different Users**  
From families with kids to individuals living solo, I can see these containers being useful across multiple scenarios. My coworker loves using them for coffee beans and tea leaves, while I use mine to corral my kids’ school snacks separately. For meal preppers, I imagine the added organization for dry ingredients would tick many practical boxes. They're exceptionally beginner-friendly—no complicated instructions or parts to juggle.

**Drawbacks**  
- The locking mechanism could be more user-friendly for certain individuals.  
- Certain people might find the sizes too small for their bulk-storage needs.  

**Competitive Options**  
When comparing these containers to competitors like OXO’s POP Containers or Rubbermaid Brilliance sets, some differences stand out. OXO’s containers have a single-button pop lid mechanism that is easier to operate but comes at a significantly higher price point. Rubbermaid offers better options for liquid storage, but I felt the Vtopmart set lacked nothing for dry goods. Another big advantage Vtopmart has is the included 24 reusable labels—those are game-changers in the war against pantry disarray. However, OXO and Rubbermaid both offer fewer pieces in their sets for a comparable cost.  

**Value for Money**  
Evaluating the **Vtopmart 24 pcs Airtight Food Storage Containers** purely on their cost-to-quality ratio, I’d say this set ranks high. For the number of containers and labels provided, along with durability and airtight sealing, this product offers fabulous value. Similar products can be overpriced due to brand recognition, but here you’re getting excellent quality without the wallet regret.

So her mom has a friend that lives in Boston, she has a son named Josh. Her mom and his mom always tried to get them together when they were growing up; and I knew this before the conversation happened right in front of my face.

We were all sitting on the couch at their house relaxing after church one Sunday. Her mom said, “I gotta pick up my friend and her son from Indy, Claire you can come with me and sit in the backseat and chat it up with Josh on the way back.” And she was like “Yeah for sure.” No shutting that down or anything, ZERO respect for our relationship. So I was like “👁️👄👁️…”

I let it sit for a few days, I obviously knew I didn’t like it. So I brought it up and I told her I was uncomfortable with it, not that I didn’t trust her; I just have no idea WHO HE IS. So when she came over to break up with me, she said “I don’t want to be with someone that is controlling who I can and can’t see.” We haven’t talked in two weeks, no check ins, nothing. She had even said “I care a lot about you, and have always cared.” So I wrote this:

Hey Claire, There’s so much I wish I could say face to face, but maybe this is how it’s meant to be. Maybe the words are easier to hear when they’re written. This isn’t to change your mind either.

I loved you with everything I had. Fully, deeply, and without holding back. I didn’t just love the highlights, I loved the small moments most. Playing spot the difference with you, getting the car washed together, going to dinner, rubbing your feet after a long day, bringing you coffee at work, random target runs, spending time with you and your family, cooking dinner for us in my apartment, those were the moments when life felt exactly right. Being able to take care of you in even the smallest ways made me feel lucky. I never needed anything more than your smile at the end of the day.

When I brought up things that made me uncomfortable, it wasn’t because I wanted to control you. It was because I wanted to be close to you. To trust you fully. To build something strong with you. I wish you could have seen that. I wish you could have seen that every boundary I set was rooted in love, not fear.

Hearing you say you don’t feel the same way, and that you don’t think you ever will, shattered something inside me. It’s hard to describe the feeling of realizing that the person you chose with your whole heart doesn’t choose you back the same way.

But even in this heartbreak, I’m still proud of how I loved you. I didn’t hold back. I didn’t play it safe. I gave you my real heart, the best parts of me, and I would rather hurt from loving deeply than live with the regret of never having tried.

I still pray for you every night.

You were someone I wanted a future with.

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Just started growing some herbs to put in the tea. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. 

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, ASA and CS2. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago. I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck, too, and been tinkering around with it.

And I just stopped smoking a pack a day today.,"I've smoking since I was 24(maybe?). I am now 31, and smoke a pack a day. Not sure how it started but it was probably hanging out with colleagues/friends where I tried as a joke - coughed my lungs out - and craved again next evening. It grew from a joke to 2-3 cig to 5-8 gigs to now 15-25 a day.

I tried to quit last year (Feb 2024) and did not smoke for 90 days straight. I do not know what happened and I told my partner I feel like I should have just ONE. I am sure ill be able to control. And I went for it when she wasn't around. Fucking stupid of me. 

Since starting again in May 2024, I've gained 15 kilos in last 9 months because I feel tired and exhausted all the time and never want to go for a workout. The days I do go for them: I'm done in 20 mins - its a horrible feeling to not be able to do most basic things.

The times I don't smoke, I feel tired. Even immediately after smoking, I feel tired. I fall down with a cig at night and wake up with a craving and classic coffee and cig breakfast. However, I do remember how my body felt 1-2 weeks when I stopped smoking last year. I felt like a whole different person who could breath better, workout for longer and more often, I wont be huffing and puffing climbing 2 floors of stairs, I was able to bike (🚲) around 7-8 km at a stretch and would enjoy it. 

Today, I took out the two packs of cig I had in my shelf. I broke each cig down and threw it in the bin along with all the lighters. I'm starting to not smoke again today, and I will stop for good, forever. I won't be surrounded by smokers, and even if I am, I will have resilience to not do it. I will do anything to distract myself and not buy another pack the next time I get a chance. I won't find an excuse to go out and have a gratifying puff, because fuck it.

I don’t understand the setup at the beginning, actually, the entire game until the end cutscene when the world apart, every single thing in the game was a combination of XC1 and XC2, starting from the combat which is hit-based (XC2) and time-based (XC1), the tea! Pyra like tea. 2 of the chain attack that split to Smash and Brust, Blade Combo. It is so great!

I did not play XC1 at all, so I don’t know Melia before but I remember Nia from the start when the game show her in Agnus Palace. It was great because I did not know anything at all, and the surprise at the end was so hype for me. 🥹 Still wonder how the design of Agnus come from XC2 world, the white/yellow/green design is more like coffee-with-milk Aegis mode, but the Japanese clothing is not, but maybe they just redesigned to make it not obvious as well. I might be wrong too 😅

I am going to play Future Redeem to immerse myself more. 

Also, a bit unexpected surprise: Rex, he seems doing great and have kids, with wives…😅 hope learn more about them in DLC.

I told this new family that my hourly rate is 20 as a minimum, because i have 10 plus years of experience! They talked me down to 17 and hour and I accepted because they were very flexible with my schedule for thursdays and fridays. But then once we did our first meet for coffee they told me that they could only do 15 and i felt super awkward and they were super nice so i said yes (ik that was dumb!)

So yesterday was my first day with them and i was just learning the routine they have set up. Also the child i’m taking care of is 5 months old and seriously attached to her mom, both the parents WFH and that’s why they need me there. The mom sat me down yesterday and said she had the contract written up for me to sign and she told me that they had to bring my pay down to 14 an hour. I was pissed but she said that my pay would go up in a few months to a year once the baby and her family were comfortable with me and once i took on more responsibilities! 

The issue i have is that 14 isn’t enough for what they are expecting of me. They want me to bottle train their daughter (since she doesn’t really take bottles and only breastfeeds), they want me to meal prep for the baby and start transitioning her over to finger foods, they want me to play learning games with the baby (they specifically want her playing with puzzles and brain boosting games), they want me to keep track of the baby’s routine and progress (they asked me to keep a journal of how much she’s eating and sleeping, including times and amounts!), they also want me to give the baby oil massages every morning before her bath! all of that not including the more common things such as changing diapers, cleaning all dishes associated with the baby, doing the baby’s laundry, and organizing and planning the baby’s outfits for the week. 

I just feel like this would all be too much for 20 an hour much less 14. I live in a pretty large city and honestly this isn’t enough for me to live comfortably off of.

That's the experience Nespresso aims to deliver. the official Nespresso description highlights a blend of cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom, adding complexity and depth.

however, individual experiences can vary. Some reviewers on platforms like Reddit [2] describe a surprising mix of citrus and berry notes alongside the expected pumpkin spice.

Customer reviews on Amazon [4] also showcase positive feedback regarding the flavor, with descriptions like ""great flavor"" and ""elegant hint of pumpkin."" These observations underline the care with which Nespresso crafts its flavors, aiming for a balanced and refined palette rather than an overpowering sweetness.

## Key Features Analysis

The best funny candles aren't just about the joke; they also need to deliver on the candle basics: a pleasing scent, a long burn time, and safe materials.

**Scent Profiles**

The scent profiles in funny candles are anything but predictable. Expect to find combinations like “Dad’s Fart” (actually a blend of maple bacon and cedarwood), “I Haven’t Slept in three years” (strong coffee with a hint of desperation), or “Adulting Is Hard” (a mix of wine corks and regret). These unconventional combinations are designed to evoke a chuckle while filling the room with an intriguing aroma. The quality of the essential oils and fragrance compounds used directly impacts the candleS overall appeal, moving it beyond a simple gag gift to a genuinely enjoyable sensory experience.

**Burn Time**

A long burn time is essential for any candle, funny or not. Top-rated funny candles typically boast burn times ranging from 50 to 80 hours for larger sizes and 25 to 40 hours for smaller ones. this extended lifespan ensures that the recipient can enjoy the candle’s scent and humor for weeks, or even months, depending on usage. Candles achieve these longer burn times thru the use of premium wax blends,such as soy,beeswax,or coconut wax,all of which have different melting points and burn characteristics.

**Wax Composition**

The type of wax used in a candle is crucial for both its performance and environmental impact.Soy wax is a popular choice due to its clean burn, sustainability, and ability to hold fragrance well. Beeswax is another excellent option, known for its natural scent and air-purifying qualities. Paraffin wax, while cheaper, tends to produce more soot and is less environmentally pleasant. The trend in the funny candle market is leaning towards natural wax blends that offer a cleaner burn and are kinder to the surroundings.

**Jar Design and Label Quality**

The jar design and label are integral to the overall aesthetic and comedic affect of funny candles. High-quality candles feature durable jars made from glass or ceramic, designed to withstand heat and prevent spills. The labels are typically waterproof and resistant to fading, ensuring that the joke remains visible for the candle's entire lifespan. Creative fonts, witty illustrations, and clever wording all contribute to the candle's overall appeal as a humorous and decorative object.

**Wick Type**

The choice of wick material also affects the burn quality of the candle. Cotton wicks are a common choice,known for their consistent and even burn.Wood wicks are another popular option, producing a crackling sound that adds to the candle's ambiance. The wick size is carefully selected to match the diameter of the candle, ensuring a proper melt pool and preventing tunneling or excessive smoking.

Key features of the best funny candles include:

*   Unique and humorous scent combinations
*   Long burn times (50+ hours for larger candles)
*   Enduring wax composition (soy, beeswax, or coconut wax)
*   High-quality jar design and durable, humorous label

I’m laid-back, sarcastic in the best way, and always down for deep convos or dumb jokes. Once I’m comfortable with someone, I’m pretty open and silly.

1kask34,https://www.reddit.com/r/kennesaw/comments/1kask34/stuff_going_on_this_weekend_first_weekend_of_may/,Stuff Going on this Weekend (first weekend of May),"Thursday (May 1st) Marietta is doing a Thursday Lunch concert on the square. Starting at noon and wrapping up at 1PM, at the Glover Park Stage the band ""Same Difference"" is performing.

Also Thursday (May 1st) at 7PM our own History Kid is giving a presentation on the Train Wrecks of North Cobb. It's free and at Acworth's Historic Rosenwald School at Doyal Hill Park. Come on out and see History Kid!

Marietta is hosting a self-guided art walk on the Marietta Square on Friday (May 2) from 5PM to 9. Some of the private galleries and the Marietta/Cobb Museum of Art is also free. This is a monthly event, so it does seem like something to do when you have a chance.

On Friday (May 2) at that little plaza between Revival on Main and the Secret Tunnel to Depot Park the Kennesaw Merchants are hosting a Comedian. ""Big Rich"" Brock will be doing the first non-music set for a First Friday event. Kicks off at 7PM and ends at 9. Meander by and listen to the funny.

A little earlier on Saturday (May 3) at Kennesaw First Baptist Church they have a Main Street Cruise In. It runs from 8AM to Noon. It's a mini-car show where food, coffee, and music is available. It's free but they'll be fundraising for the Special Olympics.

It's the Cemetery Decoration Day! on Saturday (May 3). Event starts at 9AM for cleaning. First 50 attendees get free breakfast. Rest of y'all are on your own. After the cleaning there's a guided tour at 10:30, free for the cleaners. 

Acworth is hosting the annual Dragon Boat Festival at the Dallas Landing Park on this Saturday (May 3) only from 9AM to 4PM. Come see the boat races. They're doing the normal festival stuff of live entertainment and food vendors and kids zones beyond the boats and boat racing. It's not something done elsewhere in the state.

To compete with that East Cobb and Mableton are both doing their annual ""Taste of"" events. All the local restaurants are doing booths. The Taste of East Cobb is this Saturday (May 3) from 11AM to 5PM at the Johnson Ferry Baptist Church. The Taste of Mableton is 10AM to 4PM at the Mable House Complex. Both have inflatables or kids events and local groups reaching out, so if you're not otherwise busy why not?

The concert series continues at the Depot Park Ampitheater it's a Bon Jovi Tribute Band this time. Starts on Saturday (May 3) at 7PM and runs to 10. These things have been blowing the doors off of attendance projections, so let's keep it up. If enough people show up consistently they'll have to build more bathrooms.

On both Saturday (May 3) and Sunday (May 4) we have the May-retta Daze Art Festival. It's hosted on the Marietta Square (which seems to be crazy overbooked this week) and features a Farmer's Market on Saturday a Derby Hat Parade. They'll be giving prizes for the most creative and outlandish hand-made hats.

BE NOT AFRAID on Sunday (May 4) if you happen to see a ton of people lining the ramps on Barrett Parkway or milling about the Mall, since it is only the monthly Caffeine and Octane car meet. They have tons of neat cars (hence the crowds watching them arrive and leave via the Interstate). Event Runs from 9AM to Noon.

Finally, on Monday (May 5) it's the first Kennesaw Farmer's Market of the year. It's not moved to Depot Park, but rather still in the parking lot at the corner of Moon Station and Main Street. Starts at 3:30 and runs to 7PM. In previous years I would stop by for a bite before continuing to the City Council Meetings, and that's the plan for this one as well.

1kask15,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kask15/how_does_nothing_ear_a_review_stack_up_against/,How does Nothing Ear (a) review stack up against top wireless earbuds?,"I recently got my hands on the **Nothing B162 Ear (a)** wireless earbuds, packed with features like 45dB hybrid noise cancellation, hi-res audio support, and even ChatGPT integration. After using these earbuds extensively, I couldn't wait to share my personal experience. These earbuds didn’t just land in my pocket; they became integral to my daily routine—whether I was enjoying my morning jog, gaming, or stuck on endless Zoom meetings.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The sleek and modern design of the earbuds immediately grabbed my attention. They have a glossy black finish that's simple yet elegant, and their light weight—only 50 grams—ensures they never feel bulky during extended use. The carrying case is compact, sturdy, and feels well-made, with precise dimensions of 2.49 x 0.89 x 1.87 inches. I loved that the case doesn’t hog space in my bag or pocket. Plus, the buds themselves fit snugly in the ear, thanks to the variety of ear tips included in sizes S, M, and L. Everyone from my younger sibling to my uncle found a comfortable fit. Though stylish, the smooth surface does make them a bit slippery when removing them from the case.

**Ease of Use & Smart Features**  
What truly distinguishes the earbuds is the ChatGPT integration. It's not every day that you carry earbuds capable of acting as a voice-powered assistant. Asking random questions, getting reminders, or searching for crucial details during conversations became a breeze. However, this feature is only fully optimized when used with Nothing phones, which might limit its appeal for users of other brands. Connecting the earbuds was seamless with their Bluetooth 5.3 support, and dual-connect functionality allowed me to switch effortlessly between my laptop for work calls and my phone for music. The adaptive noise cancellation deserves special mention here. Automatically adjusting to my surroundings without manual tweaks felt like a quality-of-life upgrade I didn’t know I needed.

**Sound Quality & Performance**  
Here’s where the magic happened. The 11mm dynamic drivers delivered an impressively rich and immersive soundstage. Bass notes had a depth that other earbuds often lack, providing a punchy yet smooth audio profile. Whether it was chill lo-fi beats during late-night study sessions or booming EDM tracks while working out, the earbuds nailed it. Voices in podcasts came through as crisp and well-rounded, even when I was on a crowded subway. I appreciate how the ANC performed—it blocked most background noise, including coffee shop chatter, with ease. While the noise cancellation is strong, it’s not as silent as high-end over-ear headphones, but for this size, it’s incredible.

[Want Nothing B162? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0cxpr5412/)

**Pros**  
Using these earbuds day in and day out revealed many strengths that are hard to overlook.  
- The extended battery life of up to **42.5 hours** was a lifesaver on my weekend trips away from the charger.  
- Fast-charging capabilities gave me up to 10 hours of playtime with just 10 minutes of charge, which saved me more times than I'd like to admit.  
- Integrated low-latency gaming mode ensured intense gaming sessions were sync-perfect without audio stutters.  
- Smart active noise cancellation with tailored levels that adaptively changed based on ambient surroundings.  

**Weaknesses**  
Even the most feature-rich gadgets can fall short in certain aspects.  
- ChatGPT integration felt partially undercut since full capabilities are limited to Nothing phones.  
- The 45dB ANC, while excellent, still can’t compete with over-ear noise-cancelling headphones.  
- Touch controls, while responsive, took a bit of time to get used to, and misfires happened when adjusting the earbuds mid-run.  

**Competitive Options**  
I must admit other products in this segment give the earbuds some stiff competition. Take the Sony WF-1000XM4, for example, which offers incredible ANC and slightly better sound detail. However, they’re bulkier, and the battery doesn’t last as long. The AirPods Pro 2 offer ecosystem integration for Apple users that trumps ChatGPT’s restrictions. Still, for anyone not chained to the Apple ecosystem, the B162 holds its ground stronger than you’d think. The pricing, while generally fair, feels considerably better versus Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, which lean toward luxury. From gaming responsiveness to easy multitasking, the B162 earbuds succeed in diverse scenarios other brands may overlook.

**Best Value**  
The product's price-to-quality ratio firmly impressed me. It’s tough finding such a tightly-packed bundle of features—including stellar ANC, waterproof design, and AI integration—in a pair of wireless earbuds priced within this range. Moreover, the adaptive ANC and hi-res audio delivery make these earbuds worthy of their niche claim. Sure, budget-conscious buyers might hesitate at first, but the value here will quickly prove its worth as it did for me. They made multitasking, entertainment, and even subtle lifestyle conveniences seamless every single day.

Ethan's secretary, Chloe Brooks, posted on Twitter: ""Who else has to travel for work during Thanksgiving? All the hotels are booked! At least I've got my dashing boss to celebrate with…""

The tweet included a selfie, her in a bathrobe, lying on a hotel bed. Beside her, a man's shadowy silhouette was clearly visible. The comments blew up, most people zooming in on the mystery guy. Chloe replied with a shy emoji.

I saw it. Said nothing. Just tipped her $300.

A few minutes later, she called me. Her voice had a nervous edge.

""Grace, that picture, I didn't mean to include Mr. Carter. It was totally accidental, I swear.""

Before I could say anything, Ethan grabbed the phone.

His tone was calm, but clipped. ""Grace Taylor, Chloe just started working for me. Can you stop being so sensitive all the time?""

Then, to Chloe, soft, almost gentle, ""Don't let this upset you. Grace is just overthinking again.""

At 2 a.m., Ethan finally came home.

We didn't speak. Just stared at each other across the room.

His eyes drifted to the takeout containers on the coffee table, crispy pork, cheese puffs. He frowned and tossed them straight into the trash.

""You can't keep eating like this, Grace. It's not healthy.""

I didn't respond. But his words pulled me back to a memory from last year, he'd once praised Chloe's figure while casually criticizing mine.

After that, I'd stuck to low-calorie meals for nearly twelve months.

Ethan noticed my silence, then pulled out a box and placed it on the table.

""Chloe thought this might cheer you up. She asked me to give it to you as an apology.""

I opened it. Designer shapewear. Tag still on: ""Enhance Your Beautiful Figure.""

I let out a soft laugh. Not out of amusement, but because Chloe clearly knew exactly how to get under my skin.

Ethan misread my reaction.

""She's trying to make things right. Maybe you could thank her?""

I ignored him, eyes fixed on the TV.

""Grace, are you even listening?""

He reached out and pulled me up too fast. I stumbled, landing hard on the couch with a sharp ache in my lower back.

The pain flashed hot. Old injury, seven years ago. The fire. When I dragged Ethan out myself.

He looked away, jaw tight. ""I'll get the ointment.""

I wanted to stop him. I should've. But I hesitated.

The ultrasound report in the drawer felt heavier than ever. I'd planned to tell him tonight, about the baby.

Now didn't feel like the right time.

Ethan returned with the first aid kit, rummaged inside, then froze.

""Ointment's gone. Did you, ""

He didn't finish the sentence.

But I remembered. Chloe's tweet from two weeks ago: ""He's such a sweetheart. I burned myself cooking and he rushed to get ointment for me.""

Imported. Expensive. The one I'd been saving.

I could've confronted him right then. Should've.

But instead, I smiled, tired, small. ""Don't bother. I'll go get some.""

He looked at me sharply. ""You can't go out like this. I'll go, ""

His phone rang.

He picked it up instantly. ""Chloe, what's wrong?""

Her voice was faint but unmistakably flirtatious. ""Mr. Carter… I'm at a bar. Some guys won't leave me alone. I'm kinda scared…""

""Mr. Carter, can you come get me? Please?""

Ethan tossed the first aid kit onto the couch and stood up.

""Chloe, don't worry. I'm coming.""

""But maybe you shouldn't,"" she said softly. ""Your wife might get upset…""

""She has no reason to,"" he said coolly, glancing at me.

He grabbed his coat and headed for the door.

""Ethan, wait,"" I said.

""Grace, don't start. You're overreacting.""

""You're leaving without your wallet or your phone,"" I pointed out, nodding toward the couch.

He froze for a second. Face unreadable.

""I'll help Chloe first. Then I'll take you to the hospital.""

And just like that, he walked out.

Leaving me in a silent room that somehow felt colder than ever.

Hey! I’m a 32-year-old guy from Michigan—5'10"", green eyes, athletic build, and a lover of the outdoors. I’m all about hiking, bonfires, kayaking—basically anything that gets me outside when the weather’s good. When it’s not, I’m more of a homebody: books, good shows, coffee, and chill vibes.

I’m laid-back, sarcastic in the best way, and always down for deep convos or dumb jokes. Once I’m comfortable with someone, I’m pretty open and silly.

Just looking to meet cool people—whether for chats, hanging out, or building a solid friendship. No expectations, just good vibes and seeing where it goes.

That doesn’t mean you need to find them gorgeous, but at least somewhat attractive in order to make it work, however even that wasn’t  there but some ppl arent photogenic so I decided to meet him in person to give it a shot.

I did meet him in person over coffee and liked his personality, but there’s still no attraction whatsoever, not even a little bit, it’s just zero of it that’s there.

She even told me , yes I know he’s not attractive but you’ll get used to his lack of looks, and you’re supposed to be the pretty one. She said he has a good job and comes from a good family, what more can you ask for? And she said in a couple years your beauty is going to fade.

1kasbz9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kasbz9,New Product is Overpriced and Mediocre,"As expected, Amber put out another mediocre, overpriced product. 

It’s a mid-range supplement but WAY over priced. If you’re looking at this product, there are two more effective ones at a cheaper price point to consider. 

The argument that their product is “more clean” was looked into as well. If you want a clean version, it looks like Burn-XT Thermogenic Fat Burner is more effective, cheaper and has stronger marketing claims about having a clean label. 

Could I do more research beyond a quick chat search? Yup. Am I going to waste my time? Nope. Here’s the info if you want it. 

Here’s what ChatGPT had to say: 

🧪 Effectiveness Overview
	•	Shred JYM Fat Burner: Offers a comprehensive, clinically dosed formula targeting fat loss through multiple mechanisms, including enhanced metabolism, energy boost, and appetite suppression. The inclusion of well-researched ingredients like Acetyl-L-Carnitine and Capsimax® contributes to its high effectiveness.
	•	Burn-XT Thermogenic Fat Burner: Provides a potent thermogenic effect with a focus on energy enhancement and appetite control. While effective, its ingredient profile is slightly less comprehensive compared to Shred JYM.
	•	Berbilean+ by Protea Nutrition: Combines metabolic support with digestive health ingredients. The presence of berberine and apple cider vinegar may aid in blood sugar regulation and digestion, but its fat-burning potency is comparatively moderate.

⸻

💰 Price Comparison
	•	Shred JYM Fat Burner: $37.99 for 240 capsules, offering a cost-effective option with a high number of servings.
	•	Burn-XT Thermogenic Fat Burner: $34.99 for 60 capsules, which may be more expensive per serving compared to Shred JYM.
	•	Berbilean+ by Protea Nutrition: $49.99 for 60 capsules, making it the most expensive per serving among the three.

⸻

🏁 Final Ranking (Most to Least Effective)
	1.	Shred JYM Fat Burner – High effectiveness with a well-rounded, clinically dosed formula.
	2.	Burn-XT Thermogenic Fat Burner – Moderate to high effectiveness, focusing on thermogenesis and energy.
	3.	Berbilean+ by Protea Nutrition – Moderate effectiveness, with added benefits for metabolic and digestive health.

I gave Gemini a chance to respond too. 

Here’s what it said:

Shred JYM Fat Burner

 Pros:
 -High Effectiveness: Marketed as having high effectiveness.
  -Large Quantity: Contains 240 capsules, offering a longer supply at a relatively competitive price per capsule.
  -Comprehensive Formula: Includes a variety of well-known fat-burning ingredients such as Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Green Tea Extract, and Caffeine Anhydrous.

Cons:
  -Price: The initial cost is higher compared to Burn-XT, although the quantity is also larger.
  -Proprietary Blends: Some ingredients might be part of proprietary blends, making it difficult to assess the exact dosage of each ingredient.

Burn-XT Thermogenic Fat Burner

Pros:
  -Moderate to High Effectiveness: Combines a strong profile for effectiveness.
  -Price: Most cost-effective.
  -Key Ingredients: Contains Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Green Tea Extract, and Cayenne Pepper Extract.

Cons:
  -Small Quantity: Comes in a 60-capsule bottle, so you may need to repurchase more frequently.

Berbilean+ by Protea Nutrition
 
Pros:
  -Diverse Formula: Includes a wide array of ingredients, such as Berberine Hydrochloride, Apple Cider Vinegar, and Green Coffee Bean Extract, targeting fat loss through multiple pathways.

Cons:
  -Price: Most expensive.
  -Moderate Effectiveness: Is marketed with moderate effectiveness compared to competitors.

Based on the available information, determining which product is definitively ""cleaner"" can be subjective and depends on what aspects of ""clean"" are most important to you (e.g., lack of artificial ingredients, specific certifications, transparent labeling). However, we can analyze what the brands emphasize:

Burn-XT (Jacked Factory):
 
Claims
Search results indicate Jacked Factory emphasizes that Burn-XT is manufactured in a cGMP-certified facility under strict quality control. They specifically claim the formula is free of harsh chemicals, fillers, and artificial food dyes. They also highlight transparent labeling with no proprietary blends.

Impression
These claims directly address many common interpretations of ""clean"" ingredients – focusing on purity, potency, lack of artificial additives, and transparency.

Protea Nutrition:

Claims
Search results for Protea (specifically regarding their protein, not necessarily Berbilean+) mention rigorous quality testing, reliable raw material sources (including European dairies for whey), and using high standards like ""infant-grade protein."" This suggests a strong focus on sourcing and overall quality control. An ingredient list for a different Protea product showed natural sweeteners like stevia and monk fruit.

Impression
Protea emphasizes high-quality sourcing and testing, which contributes to a ""clean"" image. However, the available search results provide less specific detail about Berbilean+ being free from fillers or artificial colors compared to the explicit claims found for Burn-XT.

Shred JYM

Claims
The information found focuses primarily on Shred JYM using ""tried-and-true ingredients"" like caffeine and green tea at ""proper doses"" for effectiveness and safety.

Impression
JYM Supplement Science emphasizes the scientific backing and effective dosing of their ingredients. The search results provided less specific information regarding manufacturing practices (like cGMP), absence of fillers/dyes, or sourcing compared to the details found for Burn-XT and Protea.

Conclusion
Based on the claims found in the search results:

Burn-XT makes the most direct and explicit claims related to being free from artificial fillers, dyes, and chemicals, using transparent labeling, and being manufactured in a cGMP facility. This aligns strongly with common ""clean label"" expectations.

Protea Nutrition appears to prioritize high-quality ingredient sourcing and testing, suggesting a commitment to quality, although specific claims about Berbilean+ lacking fillers/dyes were less prominent in the search results compared to Burn-XT.

Shred JYM focuses marketing on ingredient efficacy and proper dosing based on scientific research.

Therefore, while Protea emphasizes quality sourcing, Burn-XT's marketing and available descriptions seem to place a stronger emphasis on aspects typically associated with a ""cleaner"" product profile (no artificial additives, transparent label, cGMP manufacturing). Keep in mind this is based on available marketing information and search results, not necessarily independent verification of all claims for each product.

I had the chance to put the SimPure T1-400ALK Alkaline UV Reverse Osmosis System to the test, and it has certainly elevated my hydration game. This compact, under-sink filtration unit combines tankless design, alkaline remineralization, and UV sterilization, making it one of the most feature-rich systems I’ve tried. As someone who's skeptical of water filters not living up to their over-the-top claims, I was both impressed and cautious about a few aspects of this product.

**Streamlined and Minimalistic Design**

The tankless design was the first thing that caught my eye. Measuring just 15.6""L x 5.3""W x 15.7""H, this system slid under my sink with ease, leaving enough room for all my cleaning supplies. It’s insane how much I appreciate not having a bulky water tank taking up valuable cabinet space. Plus, the sleek aesthetic doesn’t hurt – if under-sink glam was a thing, this model would probably win awards. The tankless setup also avoids the risk of secondary contamination, which is a game-changer for me since I can’t stand worrying about mold or stagnant water.

**Check SimPure T1-400ALK price on Amazon.**

**Efficient Filtration Performance**

What sets this system apart is its **impressive filtration capabilities**. It’s verified and tested by SGS against the NSF/ANSI 58 standards. Over 99.99% of contaminants like bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, and chemicals are removed, which is more than reassuring when you think about what tap water might be carrying. I noticed a significant difference in the taste and clarity compared to unfiltered water, making everything from coffee to ice cubes feel noticeably crisper and cleaner.  

**Integrated UV Sterilization**

Another standout feature is its UV sterilization. It eliminates bacteria and algae with a 99.99% efficiency rate, which is perfect if you live in areas where water quality is questionable. The sensor automates the operation based on water flow, meaning no manual fussing around. It’s been particularly reassuring for me when preparing baby formula for my niece while she visited, knowing the water is truly purified.

**Boons of Alkaline Remineralization**

For someone who enjoys the supposed benefits of alkaline water, the remineralization filter piqued my interest. It adds essential minerals like calcium and magnesium, elevating the pH level for healthier, alkaline-balanced water. While I can’t scientifically measure the difference, I did notice a smoother mouthfeel – almost like premium bottled water. My headaches seem fewer too, but correlation doesn’t imply causation… right?

– Efficient tankless design saves space and eradicates secondary contamination risks.  
– High filtration rate removes over 99.99% of contaminants, including bacteria and heavy metals.  
– UV sterilization operates automatically to kill harmful microorganisms in real-time.  
– Alkaline remineralization enhances water quality while enriching it with vital minerals.  
– Pure-to-drain ratio of 1.5:1 reduces water waste compared to traditional RO systems.  

**Hurdles Worth Mentioning**

While the SimPure T1-400ALK excels in many areas, it’s not without its drawbacks, and I’d be remiss not to share them.  

– The system doesn’t reduce TDS levels to zero. If ultra-low TDS water is your preference, an alternative model like SimPure’s T1-400UV would be more suitable.  
– Installation might be intimidating for non-tech-savvy users, especially with all the hoses and connectors involved.  
– It relies on an electrical connection, which isn’t always convenient for everyone. In case of power outages, you won’t get purified water.  

**Peer Products: A Comparison Look**

I’ve previously experimented with a few alternatives like the APEC ROES-50 and Home Master TMAFC-ERP. Both claim similar benefits, but the differences stand out. The APEC ROES-50, while effective, doesn’t feature UV sterilization or alkaline remineralization, making it feel like a basic filter in comparison. On the other hand, the Home Master model does offer remineralization but lacks the tankless design, crowding under-counter space unnecessarily. Neither option gives the 1.5:1 pure-to-drain advantage that the SimPure model boasts.  

SimPure’s system uniquely blends cutting-edge technology with convenience, making it a strong contender. However, if electrically powered systems or integrated UV might feel ""extra"" to you, the competitors might suffice just fine.

**Price Performance**

Let’s cut to the chase about whether this system is worth it. The advanced features like UV sterilization, alkalinity enhancement, and the tankless design justify a higher price tag compared to simpler filters. While I wouldn’t call it ""budget-friendly,"" its long-term energy efficiency and reduced water waste make it a financially sound investment. Besides, I’d rather spend on health benefits than keep buying disposable plastic water bottles.

Kylea posted her usual chemical coffee nonsense 3hrs ago, still in her pajamas. One hour later, she's perusing the aisles of Walmart for zevia, plates and tumblers that she didn't purchase. One hour later, she's at home eating her bagel & cream cheese.  About 30 minutes later, she made the post above. (BTW, it was storming in Joplin this morning and we all know how Kylea feels about inclimate weather.) 

That image of Birdie (aka BB) is from an Airbnb on a recent trip (look at the floors, wallpaper, and door).  She only reveals in the comments that Birdie was spayed (image 2) to drum up engagement and worry.  

So...who dropped BB off?  Why is there still NO proof of any veterinary care for this dog's entire life? Are we to believe that a worried Kylea was out shopping in the storms?  

For me, when I see tangible proof of the surgery or vet, I'll change my tune.  Until then, Kylea's up to her eyeballs in debt, has a history of lying about medical events for herself, family and pets and she's a freaking catfish, mmmkay.  She's a broke 🐝 desperate to stay monetized. ✌️

I see the Cave of Wonders, wake him up, ask him if he wants a coffee since he seems to wake up really moody, and if he gives the chance to go inside, I'd be like, ""Noooo! I'm not here for what's in there! I'm here to see you! You're a talking cave! That's a treasure itself! Meeting you!""

Not sure how the Cave would react to that - it's not the type of answer he'd be used to hearing. Although, if someone just hung with him and listened, I'm sure he has a ton of stories to tell! And eventually, be friends with him!

And then take his treasure when you earn his trust! >:) I'm kidding, I'm kidding. He'd feel that.

**🚨 The Rest Revolution: Why Your Grind Mindset Is Failing You**  
Michelle was a hustle culture poster child - working 80-hour weeks, proud of her exhaustion. Until her body crashed. What she discovered next changed everything:  
  
**The Neuroscience of Strategic Rest:**  
• 90-minute work cycles + breaks optimize cognitive performance (Ultradian Rhythm science)  
• ""Diffuse thinking"" during rest sparks 73% more creative insights (Stanford study)  
• Chronic sleep deprivation costs $411B annually in lost productivity (RAND Corporation)  
  
**5 Rest Myths Debunked:**  
1️⃣ ""I'll lose momentum"" → Actually regains focus  
2️⃣ ""Only weak people rest"" → Top athletes prioritize recovery  
3️⃣ ""I don't have time"" → 5-minute microbreaks work  
4️⃣ ""Rest is unproductive"" → Consolidates learning  
5️⃣ ""I'll fall behind"" → Prevents burnout setbacks  
  
**Your Rest Toolkit:**

**🛌 Deep Recovery:**  
7-9 hours sleep (non-negotiable)  
Weekly digital detox (even 2 hours helps)  
  
**⚡ Energy Boosters:**  
20-minute ""coffee naps"" (game-changer)  
Walking meetings (2x more creative than sitting)  
  
**🧠 Mental Resets:**  
4-7-8 breathing (calms nervous system)  
""Nothing breaks"" (stare out window guilt-free)

**Michelle's Transformation:**

**After adopting strategic rest:**  
• 2X more productive in half the time  
• Landed her biggest client during a hike  
• Chronic headaches disappeared  
• Rediscovered joy in work  
  
**Why This Works:**

**Your brain has two modes:**  
Focused work (goal-oriented)  
Diffuse thinking (background processing)  
BOTH are essential for peak performance.

**The CEO Secret:**  
Bill Gates takes ""Think Weeks"" twice yearly. Arianna Huffington built a company around sleep science. Jeff Bezos prioritizes 8 hours nightly.  
  
**Your Action Plan:**  
Track your energy peaks/troughs for 3 days  
Schedule breaks BEFORE exhaustion hits  
Experiment with different rest types (movement, meditation, naps)  
Protect rest time like important meetings

**⚠️ Warning Signs You Need More Rest:**  
• Cynicism about work  
• Decision fatigue  
• Relying on caffeine/crash cycles  
• Sunday night dread  
  
**The Ultimate Irony:**  
The more you value rest, the less you need. By honoring your limits, you expand them.

I would understand this for a person who works a night shift job, but he works part time at a job where his hours are 11 am to 9 pm. He just can’t bring himself to sleep at night. One time after a night of drinking he stayed at my house and the next morning we woke him up at around noon and it was like a zombie woke up, he was moaning and could barely keep his eyes open. It’s how I would expect to act if someone woke me up at 3 am. We got him a coffee and we kept telling him to drink his coffee and he said “no that will just keep me awake”. I have literally heard him say his plan to sleep from midnight to 10 am as a “10 hour nap”. ",6,1745943900.0,sleep,2,1.0,False

I thought folic acid was just another safe B-vitamin… until I went down a rabbit hole of studies, DNA repair, and potential cancer risks. Spent 3 days, skipped a workout, and drank too much coffee—but came out of it questioning every ‘fortified’ label I’ve ever read. If you lift, supplement, or just like nerding out on micronutrients—this one’s for you.

This isn’t fearmongering. It’s nuance. Because not all B9 is equal, and how you absorb, use, and respond to it depends on what you eat, your genetics, and how many ""one-a-day"" pills you stack each morning without blinking.

Let’s talk mechanisms, dosing risks, MTHFR variants, and the quiet cancer signal buried in meta-analyses most people never read past the abstract.

# 1. Folate 101: The MVP of Methylation & DNA Repair

Folate is the natural, bioactive form of Vitamin B9 found in food. It supports:

* DNA synthesis & repair — critical for high-turnover tissues like the gut lining, skin, immune system, and yes, muscle tissue.
* Methylation — a cellular process involved in detox, gene expression, neurotransmitter production, and epigenetics.
* Homocysteine reduction — low folate leads to homocysteine buildup, which is linked to cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline.

# 2. Folate vs. Folic Acid – Not Just Semantics

|Nutrient|Found In|Metabolism|Risk|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Folate|Leafy greens, legumes, liver|Pre-activated, used immediately|Low|
|Folic Acid|Fortified foods, supplements|Requires conversion by DHFR enzyme|Risk of unmetabolized buildup|

Folic acid is more stable and better absorbed in the short term (\~1.7x more bioavailable), but at doses >400–800 μg/day, your DHFR enzyme gets saturated. This causes unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) to build up in plasma—especially problematic if you:

* Have MTHFR polymorphisms
* Have a history of hormone-sensitive cancers
* Are stacking fortified food, protein powders, multivitamins, and standalone folic acid

# 3. What the Research Actually Says (With Real Numbers)

|Study & Year|Population|Risk Change|What It Means|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[Stevens et al., 2012](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000653)|10 RCTs, 38,233 subjects|\+7 % overall (RR 1.07)|Slight bump—prostate up 24 % in one subgroup|
|[Qin et al., 2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijc.28124)|13 RCTs, 49,406 subjects|±0 % (RR 1.05)|Basically neutral; melanoma risk down 53 %|
|[Li et al., 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970215)|1.2 M women, cohort study|\+20 % at ≥1 mg/day|High doses clearly linked to higher cancer risk|

Stevens et al., 2012 (10 RCTs, 38,233 participants):

* Folic acid supplementation led to a 7% overall increase in cancer risk (RR 1.07)
* Subgroup: 24% higher prostate cancer risk

Qin et al., 2013 (13 RCTs, 49,406 people):

* No significant cancer increase overall
* Some cancer types like melanoma decreased—context matters

Li et al., 2024 (Cohort of 1.2 million women):

* ≥1 mg/day folic acid was associated with a 20% increase in total cancer risk over long-term use
* Not a randomized trial, but the sample size gives it weight

Bottom Line: The risk is not sky-high—but it’s not zero. If your lifetime baseline cancer risk is \~40%, then a 7–20% relative increase means you’re now at 42.8–48%. Not catastrophic—but definitely a reason to rethink daily megadoses.

# 4. MTHFR Polymorphisms: The Genetic Wild Card

The MTHFR C677T variant (common in up to 15–20% of South Asians) leads to reduced enzymatic conversion of folic acid into L-methylfolate (the usable form).

Risks if you're C677T TT homozygous:

* Low folate = DNA strand breaks, uracil misincorporation (Blount et al., 1997)
* High folic acid = unmetabolized buildup, methylation dysregulation

This isn’t pseudoscience. MTHFR variants are associated with:

* Increased risk of neural tube defects
* Mood disorders (via neurotransmitter pathways)
* Homocysteine elevation
* Possibly reduced detox efficiency

# 5. The “Three D’s” of Folic Acid Risk

1. Dose: Most risk-linked studies use 1 mg/day—that’s 2.5× the RDA (400 μg). Some multivitamins go up to 5 mg.
2. Duration: Cancer takes time. Many trials run 5–7 years, but tumors often develop over 10–15 years.
3. DNA Variants: MTHFR, DHFR, and others affect how you process and retain folic acid. That “standard dose” isn’t standard for everyone.

# 6. Folate’s Paradoxical Effects on Cancer and Immunity

* Low Folate = DNA Breakage: Uracil is misincorporated, increasing chromosomal instability (Blount, 1997)
* High Folate = Cell Growth Fuel: Supports all fast-dividing cells—including micro-tumors
* Immune Impact: UMFA may blunt NK (natural killer) cell activity, reducing tumor surveillance (Troen et al., 2006)
* Epigenetics: Too much folate = hypermethylation of tumor-suppressor genes; too little = global hypomethylation (Crider et al., 2012)

It’s not about more or less. It’s about balance—especially if you’re stacking creatine, B12, and protein powders that already contain added B-vitamins.

# 7. Jay’s Real-World B9 Protocol (Lifter + Flyer Edition)

1. Food-First Strategy:

* Breakfast: Spinach + paneer sandwich + mint chutney
* Lunch: Chana chaat, coriander-heavy
* Snack: Homemade sprouts with lemon + chili

1. Smart Supplementation:

* Only on gym or simulator days: 400 μg folic acid (part of a B-complex)
* No daily stacking of multivitamin + protein powders + fortified cereal

1. Labs I Track Yearly:

* Plasma folate + homocysteine + CBC
* May consider UMFA test if trends emerge

1. Contextual Modifiers:

* Family history of prostate or lymphoma? Be more conservative
* Pregnant/planning pregnancy? Then yes—folic acid as prescribed is protective
* Vegan diet? You might need careful monitoring to avoid deficiency

# 8. Questions for the Sub:

* Anyone here get tested for MTHFR or UMFA levels? What did you change?
* Have you ever had odd blood markers after a period of high-dose folic acid?
* Do you cycle B-vitamins or just run them year-round?
* What’s your favorite folate-rich meal from your culture?

It was easy and fun. He said that he could come again and we could go to the cinema. He said that I was really fun to hang out with.
Later I sent him a message asking if he arrived home safely, he said yes. The next day I saw that he had deleted his profile. I feel so stupid,  I thought that he was a nice guy. I'm not sad that he didn't want to see me again, but that he acted like I wasn't a person and that I was so wrong about his character. How difficult is it to just write ""sorry it was nice but I didn't feel anything ""? Or anything? Has this happened to you? 

I had informed him before that I have asd, he was fully aware and I am high masking. But maybe it still played a part.

35 male from South Bay Area , Seperated looking to start dating again. Have kids, but not full time. Looking for a normal mature woman for a little physical and emotional connection.

I’m educated and work in a field with majority males ( don’t worry, not a tech bro) so I don’t interface women often. I’m 5’8, full head of hair and told that I’m handsome often. I’m weight and height proportional, muscular but not a total gym rat. Don’t have a body type but do require weight and height proportionate, slightly chubby is fine. I am a sucker for super pretty faces. Any height is fine including taller.

I’m a nerdy gear head that loves machines as well as food and coffee. I’m a man’s man but very emotionally intelligent. I also love to be in the kitchen, whether it’s cooking or baking. Also coffee, I love coffee and matcha. 


Hoping to take it slow and swap pics, and if there’s a connection, meet for coffee. 

Let me know more about you!

Yeah, that was years ago. At this point, I'm at that stage where I feel lucky to be alive just because of the fact that I constantly feel I could die at any moment, which, to be fair, I could but still.

I have not cried for a while now, but God every waking moment is a drag. I do not want to die, that is the worst of all, if I wanted to die then death would serve as a consolation, some sort of sick comfort in this tragedy of a life.

Death anxiety is the worst. I have had days where every second is spent worrying about death. I cannot eat without fear for some moments, I often have panick attacks at night that cause me to sleep poorly. I feel like a corpse that should feel guilty for just existing.

I have no friends and never had a girlfriend. My family looks down on me, but I can't feel bad about it because they still take care of me. All those comments about how useless I am I guess I should ignore those. Must be my fault for not doing enough, despite doing the dishes for the entire house when these people can't even put their stinking cup of coffee near the sink.

This is not a judgment post. I am hungry, physically hungry, not just craving. I might be pretty but I will never feel as such, and even when I do feel handsome it's all useless because I'll never get laid anyway.

That's it really. Nobody even cares and if they do then like good for them I guess it doesn't really matter that fact won't change my anxiety.",1,1745943627.0,GuyCry,4,1.0,False

At first, it’s relief. The groan of traffic, the barking dogs, the endless voices on endless devices, all of it fades like a bad smell caught in a clean wind. You open your windows to the stillness, let it flood your apartment. It's almost luxurious, this quiet.

You wake the next morning to the same hush. No planes overhead. No radios bleeding through walls. You smile into your coffee, thinking maybe this is what ancient mystics meant when talking about “inner peace”.

At the office, it’s even better. The hum of computers, the slow drone of conversations, the constant clatter of keyboards, it’s all... *gone*. You watch your coworkers mime their lives in perfect pantomime. Phones ring soundlessly. Mouths move without words. You wonder how no one seems to notice.

At lunch, you sit under a tree and listen to the absence. You hadn't realized how many tiny, petty noises there had been until now. You feel taller somehow. Cleaner. As if every shriek and scrape and shrill syllable had been weighing you down without your knowing.

At sunset, you hear nothing at all. Not the creak of your chair, not the rustle of your sleeves, not even the click of your own tongue.

You laugh. Or at least, you think you do. There's no sound to prove it.

The world becomes a painting. Streets full of silent cars. Lovers mouthing sweet nothings you cannot hear. Dogs chasing balls you cannot hear bounce. Somewhere, a mother must be screaming for her child to come home, but it’s just air shaping itself against her mouth.

It’s funny, how fast you get used to it.

By the third day, you move differently. Softer, more careful. You step lightly, hold your breath longer than you used to. It feels rude somehow, making any movement too sharp. There’s a grace to silence. A dignity.

You stop answering emails. You stop checking the news. They don’t matter anymore.

At night, your dreams are deep and dark and *silent*. You wake refreshed.

Eventually, you stop speaking, too. Words are old tools, rusty, clumsy things. Who needs them? Everything important is conveyed by a glance now, a gesture. When you walk past your neighbors, you smile and they nod back solemnly, as if recognizing a shared membership in some secret, noble society.

It’s a beautiful new world.

You almost don't notice the shadows lingering.

At first you think it’s just the trick of perfect quiet, the mind inventing stimulus where none exists. But no, they're real. You see them, coiled in corners, perched atop lamp posts, pressed against windows.

Tall things, thin and shimmering. Watching.

They don't speak, of course. They have no need. They simply *are*. As if they’ve been here all along, and now that the last clatter and cry has been scrubbed clean from the earth, they can finally step forward.

You understand.

This silence wasn't a gift.

It was an invitation.

And you, *you*, answered it.

I’m living on my grandfathers old farm and trying to get it up and running again.  The town itself is pretty cute.  Some people are really nice and others kind of stand off ish (this girl literally told me I smelled bad).  

Anyways, there’s a local doctor.  I was introducing myself to everyone I could so I stopped in his office.  I was pretty instantly attracted to him.  He is kind of dorky but really cute and that’s totally my type.  The next day I brought him a cup of coffee I bought at the saloon and he really liked it!!

I think I may have messed things up though.  I need to make money so I’ve been working extra hard and forgetting to eat.  I passed out one day on the farm and apparently he had to rescue me.  I can’t remember any of it but I got a letter from him in the mail with a bill for the visit.  A few days later I was in the local mines mining for gem stones that I can sell to buy seeds and supplies for my farm.  I ended up getting attacked by some bats and had to be rescued from the cave.  

When I woke up, I was in the doctors office.  He was standing over me looking at me with such  care and concern.  I could tell he was a little upset that I got myself in so much danger.  But maybe… this means he cares about me?!  I don’t know though… he seems stressed about work sometimes, and I’m just a smelly farmer after all (like that blonde girl told me).

Here’s some tips that I’ve collected from ten years of internet minimalist blogs. 

1. Our walls are painted light colors and we open up the windows every day to let in the sunshine.
2. We have the least amount of things on the floor as possible. We have shelves hung for books instead of bookcases. We have floating desks attached to the wall. We don’t have a coffee table.
3. We have a closet in my husband’s office that holds extra learning to read books, puzzles, games, craft kits, different sets of toys, a few holiday decorations, hand me downs. We shut the door to the closet and it’s all in there in clear boxes so I can see. The box is the limit, for example I can only hold as many Christmas decorations as fit in the box. 
4. Toys in our tiny 5 x 7 living room are in nice looking baskets. Magnet tiles, model animals, and a basket of fake food and a tea set live out there. Dolls and stuffed animals live on my girl’s beds. 
5. I try to have a clear counter and an organized front of fridge. Sometime I shove it all into a nice looking box and deal with it later 🙃
