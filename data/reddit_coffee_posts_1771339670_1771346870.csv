The effluvium of coffee breath and fresh sardines was a whiff I took every morning and have since the first day I can ever remember. It always left a sour tang on my tongue and made my taste buds curl. I learned later on that holding my breath was the best way to get through dad and his too-big hugs and kisses. It comes in a weird bottle, too; the shape of it standing is the basic outline of a leaf blower, and the stilt of it is rather odd as well. Two splashes were all it took for that stench to take over even his strongest cologne. I wondered if everyone else could smell what I could, and all of them have just agreed together to never say anything to the poor man. He’s just walking around with a distinct gagging odor, while taking my advice was never a thought in his mind, and even just considering the thought of my opinion might have spared him from the stink. I can recall as vividly as possible the moment I finally decided to do something about my dad’s aftershave. 

There have been so many gifts over the years that I have bought my father using my own saved money, only to have him collect the new, better bottles away in his closet. He loved anything that came from me, so taking the aftershave as a gift was just as delightful as me handing him a million dollars. I guess that’s what it's like to have kids. I sometimes climb up to the back shelf of his wardrobe to see the multicolored glass collection, doing nothing for my dad but gathering up some dust for him. I talked to my mom about the smell, and she always just smiled and laughed and said, ‘Well, that’s just your father sweetie,’ and that’s all I ever got from her. I went to my older sister, and she just told me how rude I was, even saying things about our dad. Then there was Bruce, the oldest, and he, like always, just pretended like I didn't exist. I really wanted to ask strangers if my thoughts about my father having an unbearable reek were a valid thought, or maybe I was having a little bit of a harsh opinion. What was I even going to say to someone? Hey, do you think my dad smells bad? Who does that? 

It was after the millionth try that I decided to give up on trying to make him realize his issue and took the situation into my own hands. I went to a cheap dollar store, which was all I could currently afford, and I got the fanciest bottle they had. My sister drove me home, speaking to me as if I were actually listening. There was something about a guy named Brad, and I think he is a total asshole, and I think Miranda had something to do with it. I am not sure. I don't listen to my sister. I think that Chelsea is a bit dense and bippy, you know, a complete ditz. I really don't want to call her dumb, but I'll do it anyway. When I got home, I ran upstairs and got my dad’s aftershave bottle from the top cabinet next to his two-sink counter and one massive mirror. I dumped everything, the last drop down the sink of the white porcelain tainted lightly pale blue, watching it disappear into a twirl down the metal drain. I didn't feel bad for what I was doing, to be honest, I really didn’t think I was doing anything wrong. I was helping, right? 

I don't know why I wouldn't think my father would immediately tell the difference in his aftershave. The two burning liquids smelled miles apart. My dad cursed so loud that I thought my eardrums were going to burst. The thriving anger in his tone sent waves of dread over every bone in my body. I had never heard my father act this way in my entire life. I've never even seen my dad get upset over anything or anyone. The man was annoyingly nice.

The whole house went silent. The only sound was my own heartbeat, loud and stuttering in the hush. I could feel every muscle in my body tense, waiting, every second stretched too thin.

I wanted to hide when I heard him belting down the stairs. I got as small as I could in my seat, and I looked down at my cereal like it was the last thing I was ever going to see. My dad reached the bottom of the stairs and looked manic. The way his hair just fell apart after getting put together so well, and how his chin shone from a fresh shave, made my brain stop working. What have I done? Why was this situation so dire? Why was my father acting this radically over a bottle of aftershave? The questions were endless, and all I could or wanted to do was look at the colorful floating balls in my already discolored milk.

He sprinted to my mom first, who was in Bruce’s room, yelling and picking up laundry, which is what I would assume. That was one of her morning rituals when getting the lethargic teen out of bed in the morning, so maybe for once he wouldn't be late to school. My older sister drove me to school, and when I say we were always punctual, I mean we were always fifteen minutes early. I was always stuck waiting on the front stairs of my school building, my ass on cold concrete, my body and mind impatiently waiting for the first bell to ring so I could run inside. The house was too quiet for a moment, and the first thing I saw barreling towards me was Bruce. He picked me up by my collar, my feet hovering over the off-white tiles, and he forced my face to look at him. 

“What did you do?” That's what he asked me. 

My dad and mom came sprinting down the hall, my father only taking two strides before releasing me from my brother’s grasp. The two of them argued for a moment, a disagreement that ended with a ‘yes, sir’. My older sister was now involved, and she was frantic to get her nose into this raw family drama. I sat back in the soft, comforting wood of the kitchen chair, and with my head bowed, I closed my eyes. I never prayed, but right now felt like a moment where I needed to. My father was beyond ticked off, and you could see it in his red, huffing face. He was pissed off. I did this because I was helping. I started this battle, which I had no idea I was getting myself into. 

“Jeremy.” My father’s voice was calm as he bent down to look into my eyes. He lifted up my chin, water already making my eyes wide and glossy. “Did you do something with my aftershave?” When he asked the question, I could see his veins throbbing in his forehead, but his voice remained even. 

This was one of the first times I was this close to my father, and I could stand to smell him. I wanted to hug him so tight while the moment was there, knowing after this tragedy, I would be back to huffing in his god-awful fumes. 

“Jeremy, I need you to tell me the truth.” he put his hand kindly on my shoulder and pulled my chin all the way up so that I could meet his gaze. 

I nodded my head. 

“Okay. That’s okay. What did you do with it”? He was beginning to sound relieved, but I didn’t want to tell him the truth. 

“I... I poured it... in the drain.” My voice cracked, each word coming out in fragments and barely making it past my lips. I wasn’t ready to say it out loud.

“Son, I need you to speak up to me.” His voice was growing increasingly impatient and annoyed. 

“I poured it down the drain.” It was a whisper, but it was loud enough for my father to hear. 

The way he gripped the back of my chair, his knuckles turning pale white, I thought he was gonna splinter the wood. 

“I must have another bottle around here.” He said it more to himself than to anyone else. “Stop standing around,” his yell made everyone jump. He pushed his fingers through his still-gelled hair. “Just start looking around.” He was a bit calmer when he spoke, but the fear and anger remained. 

I watched my entire family as they frantically ran around, sprinting from one room to the next, hoping to find a spare bottle. I knew there wasn't one. Everyone else knew it, too. Dad only orders them one at a time, because they are specially made and very expensive. But rushing around the house made all of them feel a sense of ease, giving themselves the false hope that they are soon to find their treasure. 

“You really did it this time.” It was Bruce, as he even looked in the cabinets in the kitchen. 

“What’s the big deal?” I wanted to know more than anything else in the world. Why was this aftershave important? 

“Dad needs it.” My brother spoke in a tone that piqued my curiosity and gave me a sense of understanding. Who knows why he needs it, but he needs it nonetheless, and even I joined the brigade of searching for an imaginary prize. It was when we all gave up that we walked into the living room and sat down. 

“Well, what do we do?” My mom was panicked and exasperated, and she had no clue how to find an answer to this situation. 

“We just let it happen.” It was my father who sat down in his chair and locked his eyes with me. “Let's see how important he thinks my belongings are after he sees what it does for me and what it does to me without it.” He was stoic and blank as he still sat, his eyes pointed right into mine, as if his stare was to be etched into my mind, before he looked away. 

I took a seat on the couch across from my father and looked down at my lap. My mother was the one who called everyone in for the dad-dialing work and school, shaking her head with shame. Then my mother took a seat next to me and anchored me with her arm around my shoulders. We sat for a couple of hours before everyone grew tense with anticipation. My father never stopped looking at me as his transformation began.

At first, his left eye began to droop so low that his jaw slipped out of place.

I watched as his skin fell into puddles and his body disappeared. A piece of goo was in place of my father, sitting upright but melting.

The blob slid down the chair and began wiggling toward me slowly. Its girth was immense, and the goo was a giant mass slithering toward my seat. I curled my legs up as my mother held me down.

“What’s happening?” I couldn't help but let the fear lace my cry. 

“It’s okay. Just let it happen, sweetheart.” My mother was petting my head, pulling my hair back with slow, gentle motions. 

Bruce and my older sister were sitting around me, motionless and expressionless. I watched as my dad, the glob, rose and climbed over the lip of the coach. 

“Don't let it get me,” I begged my mother as I tugged on her and clawed for help. She just shushed me as if she were calming a baby in distress. 

The melting glob of human flesh reached out to me with a part of its moving body, the fleshy slime collecting and falling together around the mass. It touched my foot, and I couldn't help but stomp on it. Once my foot hit the surface of the gelatin, it was engulfed by its jelly. I threw my body off the side of the coach, wiggling free from my locked prison, and I tried to claw myself away from the thing that was supposed to be my father. 

“Don't fight it, sweetie.” My mother was placid when she spoke, and it made my skin bubble with anxiety. 

“Please let me go.” I cried back at the mass that was collecting my leg. 

I watched as two eyes floated on top of the gel and placed together so it could look at me. The stare of the afloat organs bore into my eyes, and the pupils are so large that the blue is almost invisible. My father sucked me up to the waist, gathering more and more of me. I was whimpering now, my cries for help being ignored. I didn't understand what was happening to me, and I couldn't comprehend why my father would put me through this. The feeling that the suction had over my body was fierce as it blobbed up to my armpits. My arms were still forward, clawing at the ground, my fingernails were breaking and bleeding against the splinters of the floor. The malodorous gas that oozes from the tiny pores all over its body had the sharp tang of tin-can brine, and a cut open tuna. My dad took over my face, and the goo came with force, gobbling me up with pleasure. I floated on my stomach once I was inside the melted flesh. My dad’s insides floated around me, and his bones weren’t there. I couldn't move my limbs while I was inside the jello, but I was breathing just fine. It was just the god-awful stench of sardines, dense as a fish market at closing, that slipped around me like a breeze coming and going with the invisible wind.

My father’s organs began to collect around me, coming together in all the right places. He was lying down on his belly like me, his eyes leering at mine. I could see past him at his completely formed organs, and I could see his lungs inflating and deflating with a soothing rhythm. I looked at the translucent gel, darker than the rest, that flowed in, out, and around his intestines and other innards. To see your father’s guts was a rare sight to behold, and I wished that it was a sight I never got to see. I turned my neck, barely pushing through the mushed flesh that firmly gripped me and I looked at his mouth as it gaped open, strands of dark goo stretching with elasticity pulling up and down as his lips parted. His voice sounded like someone speaking underwater. I wondered if I tried to speak right now, if I would sound the same. His words might have been distorted and garbled, but they were clear. 

“Don’t touch my aftershave.” 

This is all he said as a ripping pain waved up my body. My skin parted. Everything inside me emptied out. Hot pain. Tears pricked at my eyes, stinging and pooling beneath them. The agony went on. Forever, it felt like. At last it stopped. My father released me. The suction spat me out, slow, shuddering. I saw his organs running around his heart. Thump, thump, thump. Everything blurred. Cold floor under me. I tried to breathe. Stillness. I couldn't move. Hands lifted me, turned me, placed me on my bed. Cotton brushed my head. Sheets pressed tight beneath me. I wanted to move. I couldn't. Did he paralyze me? Nerves gone wrong, maybe. My body just lay there. I stared up. The ceiling fan spun, again and again. The air brushed my face. My arms, my legs, trapped, heavy, unmoving.

I lay there for a very long time with no activity around me. Then I heard the door creak open quickly as someone stepped into the room. Whoever it was took long strides to get to me. Then, hovering over me, her fingertips rubbed my cheek. 

“What’s happened to me?” I begged to know, a bit surprised that I was still able to speak since everything else was paralyzed. 

“Dear,” she said with a sigh. “I truly am sorry for what’s happened to you. But understand this, it was your own fault.” Her words were kind, but they helped raise a deep concern. She looked down at me with pity. 

“Why can't I move? Have you paralyzed me?” I was sobbing with snot collecting together above my top lip. 

I couldn't wipe my face, but my mother could, and she did so softly. She brushed my cheeks again and again, and she began to cry with me. I still sat with no explanation on the actions that were done to my body to disable me from doing everything but see, breathe, and speak. 

“We had no other choice, please believe that. But you were the one to touch it, and now you are being punished for your wrongful actions.” My mother was still crying as she spoke. She wiped my cheek, voice all silk and sorrow. “We took your bones from your body, honey.” The clinical words hung in the air, sharpened by the softness of her endearment and the gentle rhythm of her hand. My mother finally let out what I needed to hear. I needed some kind of explanation, and here I got it.

“Where did my bones go?” I was filled with so much confusion, fear, and sorrow, all boiling inside of me, coming out together as tears and whimpers. 

“There is someone I would like you to meet.” My mother beckoned someone over to my side, and the boy came into view. He must have been no younger than thirteen, my age. 

“I am Alex.” The boy introduced himself as my mother held both of his shoulders. 

“Hi Alex.” I sniveled, and a little croak was the only way I could reply. 

“I'm the one who took your bones.” The boy looked down at me with burning blue eyes. Eyes, I have seen pierce into me a thousand times over. 

“Alex is now part of our family, and we will treat him just like any of your siblings, and I am duty-bound to once again take on a child to raise.” She sounded more exasperated than she did  so with angst. 

“Will I live like this forever?” I still looked deep into the boy’s eyes.

Alex combed my hair as my father would, and he said this, “Many will come and go, but I am forever.” I didn't understand what he meant. 

Both of them kissed me on the cheek before leaving the room together, leaving me alone. After a while, Alex came back just to sit and speak with me. I was dumbfounded and angry by what he had to say. 

He let out a sigh, “I really didn't have a choice after you disobeyed me. It was my fault for not telling you the truth, but after discovering the reactions from both of your siblings, I thought it would be better to keep this secret to myself.” I could feel the mattress as it dented in from Alex’s body weight. 

“You took my bones, and you turned into a teenager?” I was trying to make sense of the situation. 

“How else would I be? Your bones are not yet grown, and now I have to live through childhood once more.”  He sounded bitter towards me. “I thought this time I would grow old in one body and die in it with your mother, but you changed my fate, and I will never be able to touch or look at your mother the same again.” He was venting to me, telling me all his frustrations. “I've really never kept myself after forty, having to do this process again and again. I fall in love and start a family to have it torn from me, and the taunting is sometimes too much to bear. “My father let out another sigh. “Listen, I am still something to you, and I will come to you every day so you won't ever be alone.” My father’s promise overfilled me with a scoring dread. 

“Alex,” I was done crying now, and I was still in the process of accepting my fate. 

“Yes?” He called out as if he were waiting for me to ask him something. quick and under a deep breath. 

“How long am I going to be like this?” I needed to know the truth, even if it diminished my soul for the rest of eternity. 

Alex let out a sigh, and he didn't answer quickly, nor was he emotional with his words. “You will grow old just as you are. You will be taken care of, and we will make you are as comfortable as possible during the different stages of your life. I will be here, though. Throughout your whole life, I will keep you warm and safe.” His promises hit me with hope so empty it barely touched me.

“Can you just kill me?” I wondered, thinking I had found a solution to this dilemma. 

“I have not and will not kill the host under any means. You must die naturally. I know it seems harsh, but it feels like the least I can do since I took your life.” He suggested filling himself with hope that I would accept this answer. 

I had to accept this answer. I couldn't get my bones back, I knew I couldn't grow them back, and I knew there was no use in trying to get new ones. How would I even try to get new bones? It's not like I'm going to be taken to the hospital or anything. I knew my parents had a plan in place if this were to ever happen. They have a new protocol when it comes to a dead child. That’s what I was to everyone but this family. I was dead. I whimpered to myself and tried to hum some tune to soothe my bursting anguish. I could feel my father rubbing my leg from under the blankets. It was a fatherly touch that I would keep forever in different forms. Or maybe he will find the one, and he will die peacefully at their side. Alex got up and looked down at me. 

“Do you need anything? Can I make you more comfortable?” His question was a joke to me. 

I didn't bother to reply, and I sat sorrowfully alone once my father left my room. All I could ever do anymore is watch the movement of the ceiling fan above me. ",1,1771346764.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Using Geoblink by MyTraffic, we analyzed the Café Lacoste location to understand the strategy behind the opening, from demographic alignment to footfall dynamics and competitive intensity.

The result? A clear example of experience-first retail, grounded in data rather than intuition.

This winter, I started collecting the leaves that naturally fall from the plants on my balcony instead. All of these are fallen coffee plant leaves.

In isopod setups, dried leaves are used as leaf litter. Beyond that, these leaves also act as slow food. Since they come from a dicot plant, they’re higher in lignin, so they break down very slowly. Over time, a light layer of fungus and biofilm develops on them, which is actually what the isopods feed on.",1,1771346688.0,isopods,0,1.0,False

They told me the building had been emptied for weeks. They told me the pipes were shut off, the elevators were sealed, the tenants—if there had ever been any—had been moved somewhere safer, somewhere warm. I knew how bureaucracy dresses a story: a clean stack of memos and canards laid over rot. My job was simple. Sit on the third-floor landing, watch three cameras, log any movement in the spreadsheet they gave me, and press the red button on the console if something needed ""escalation.""

I had brought a thermos and a packet of instant coffee. The thermos steamed like a small, stubborn animal. I liked the simplicity of the routine—two cameras over the stairwell, one across from Room 4. Everything else was black. The spreadsheet had a column titled “Anomalies” and another titled “Action Taken”; both were empty rows waiting for me, neat as graves.

On hour two, the camera over Room 4 flickered. The feed stuttered, like a throat clearing. On the live monitor I saw a strip of light crawl along the floor in the darkness, slow and tentative, like it was testing the temperature of the floorboards with its tongue. I logged it. Anomalies: intermittent light source; Action Taken: none.

I told myself it was the wiring. Old buildings have memories in their walls—buried circuits that half-remember the people who used them. I watched the light map across the floorboards and pause under the doorframe, as if listening, then slide away. The thermos cooled in my hands.

By hour five the light had changed. It was no longer searching; it was drawing. From the corner of the hallway it traced letters along the plaster, slow and deliberate. I recorded the time: 2:47 a.m. The letters were small, then larger—first a circle, then a crooked line, a smear that could have been an eye. The camera resolution turned details into suggestion. The eye looked at me.

The building made no sound I recognized. The HVAC unit coughed like an old dog and quit. Pipes moaned and then fell silent. The only clear noise came through the speakers—low and intermittent—a scratching, like someone rubbing their hands together very slowly in a paper glove. I listened to it until my knuckles hurt.

I called the number on the sheet. A recorded voice told me they were ""experiencing a higher-than-normal volume of calls"" and to leave a message. I left an exact message: ""Camera three is drawing letters."" There was a sound like my own voice being played back to me, but the pauses between the words were all wrong, like someone had cut the tape and spliced it back together in the dark.

The letters on the wall rearranged themselves between camera frames. When I rewound the footage, night folded over night in the same small segment, and the letters slit into new words. They spelled my name twice before I understood what I was watching. I hadn't told them my name. I had not told anyone.

If the building had been emptied, something else had been left—a patient thing with the time and care to watch every feed and reach for the television glow like a lover. That knowledge wasn't comforting. It was patient and curious in a way that felt older than the building's bricks.

I stopped sleeping. I consumed hours by replaying footage, zooming until pixels bled into eyelashes. The letters proliferated. They carved sentences that could be read if you let the camera linger long enough to mend the static. ""Do not leave,"" one read. ""Stay with us,"" another begged in a script that looked like a child's apology. Once, for three frames, a face hung on the threshold of Room 4: not a person who belonged to the world of the building, but a mask of everything I had ever forgotten—the precise angle of my father's jaw, the color of a teacher's shoes, a fragment of the boy I used to be who could still name constellations.

I began to find things in the footage I did not recall seeing. A man in the stairwell that dissolved when I tried to freeze him. A woman whose mouth opened into a hole of static and arranged the letters while the camera melted. In the morning, my hands shook so badly I spilled coffee down my shirt. I told myself there were explanations. There are always explanations. But these were wrong shapes on top of wrong shapes.

On the eighth night, the light left the wall and walked. It padded down the hallway; the glow pulsed like a heart held too close to the skin. It moved with a strange, deliberate slowness, the kind of care you take when you're holding something that might shatter. The camera followed it. When it reached Room 4, it stopped and sat with its back against the door, like a child waiting to be let in.

I felt a pressure in my chest that had nothing to do with panic and everything to do with the steady, dull ache of missing something I couldn't name. Outside, somewhere distant, a car alarm went off and then decided it had no business making noise in that town. The world went quiet and watched the camera.

I could have left. The logical path branched and ended in a small, tidy paragraph: drive home, hand in the log, never work another third shift. But logic is just paper when the world folds itself into new shapes. I stole downstairs in my boots and opened the lobby door so the night could take me in. The building took me, not as a visitor but as a guest kept too long at an old friend's funeral.

The hallway smelled like old salt and sugar. The light met me at the base of the stairs and climbed with me. Its warmth was not warmth. It was the ghost of heat, like remembering summer when winter has your bones in its mouth. It left a faint, phosphorescent trail on the banister that shimmered under my fingers. I tried to catch it. My hands closed on air that felt like someone else’s breath.

Room 4's door was not locked. Good. Bad. I could not tell. When I pushed, the hinges exhaled and the room unfolded itself like a folded map laid out for a stranger. It contained a single chair, facing the corner. The chair was simple, wooden, nicked and squat—the kind of thing meant to hold someone steady. On the seat, a child’s handwriting curled across a sheet of paper.

My name was there, written and overwritten and written again, the letters sinking into each other like footsteps in mud. Around my name were drawings—circles and eyes, houses with no roofs, staircases that led into closed mouths. I felt the teeth of the place press against my ribs. I wanted to laugh because this was absurd. I wanted to run because that would be an honest response. Instead, I sat on the chair opposite the paper, feeling ridiculous and obedient all at once.

The light's voice came not from the air but from the paper itself. It threaded between the letters and spoke in my mind in a child's cadence. ""You came back,"" it said. ""You shouldn't have to be alone.""

I didn't know what answer I had been saving. I had prepared a thousand small, sensible responses and none of them lived in my mouth anymore. My chest wanted to be a lock; something invisible had found the key.

The paper told me things I had never believed could be true. It described the time I had climbed onto the roof of my childhood home to see if falling would be different at thirteen than at any other age. It described the precise brand of soap my mother had used the night she stopped speaking. It told me the names of the men I had let pass me by. It named every private sorrow as if it had been waiting in a line to be called.

When it came to the end of the list—when the handwriting paused and took a breath that my throat could feel—it wrote, simply: ""Stay. Tell us your name again.""

There is a point in a long night when you discover that the thing asking you to stay is not pleading; it is making an offer. Offers are dangerous in abandoned places.

I wrote my name on the paper because some small part of me wanted to be seen. The pen slid like a whisper across the page. The letters dried in the air with a tiny, exultant crack. The chair across from me creaked, though no one sat. The light folded itself into the curve of the ceiling and now the room held only the fan of its radiance, patient and waiting.

The next morning the cameras recorded the same footage I had lived through, pixel for pixel: my boots on the carpet, the hand that pushed the door, the chair I sat in—except in the recorded version, I did not rise. The console showed a frozen loop, two hours long, where my reflection remained in the dark corner like a blister on film. My phone lay on the table in the footage: buzzing, dead, never answered. The spreadsheet contained an entry under Anomalies this time: Third-shift operator present in Room 4. Action Taken: None.

I still felt the paper's weight. I still had the smell of the light in my clothes. I told myself I could walk out. I told myself to call someone. But every time I reached for the doorknob the hallway rearranged itself. The banister would glide away as if it had been gently removed by someone polite and unyielding. The exit shifted farther, like a horizon that keeps retreating as you walk toward it.

Days collapsed into the film loops. Sometimes the camera recorded me asleep with my head on the table and the light pressed into the corner of my eye. Sometimes it recorded an empty room with my boots standing as if waiting for a foot to be slid into them. Once, the camera recorded someone else standing in the doorway: not another operator, but a figure made of the same thin light, holding up a paper where my name had been written in a hand I did not know. It copied me with the wrong rhythm—a mimicry that made my skin ache.

I stopped wearing a watch. Time stopped being a thing that passed and started being a stone I carried in my pocket. The spreadsheet filled itself with entries I had not typed. Under ""Action Taken"" it wrote in a handwriting that was not mine: ""Witness anchored. Do not disturb.""

People in my life called. Names I loved asked where I had gone. I could not explain that the building had folded me into a corner and hung a loop of me on the wall like a portrait. I told them I had gone out of service, that there had been a technical issue, that I had misplaced my keys. Each lie was a thin bandage that peeled away the moment I looked at it.

Once, in a half-remembered dream that felt more honest than waking, I watched the feed and I saw myself at the console, watching the monitors, watching the file marked ""Room 4"" that contained every possible version of me. Sometimes I was young and laughing; sometimes I was old and bone-white; often I was simply waiting. Waiting is a profession of its own, and I had become its laborer.

On a morning that might have been Tuesday or might have been nothing at all, my mother left a message. She said a name I had not heard in years and asked if I was coming for dinner. She said she loved me. The message vibrated against the plastic of my phone, a tiny, decisive bell. I pressed play and listened to the proof of a life I had not yet abandoned.

Behind me, in the recording on the monitor, the paper in Room 4 peeled a single corner and flew like a moth straight toward the camera. The light that had always been patient suddenly moved with the reckless speed of a thing that had decided to be hungry. The feed turned into static. The monitors blinked like eyes being closed with a finger.

The console traced a new entry across the spreadsheet, typed in letters that were my own hand, precise and angry: ""Evacuate. Do not be an echo.""

I stood. I grabbed my coat—the one I had left draped over the chair for what felt like a lifetime—and walked. The hallway had changed; it lay open like a throat. The exit was there, and it was not. In the stairwell the light uncoiled itself, a living rope, and began to climb ahead of me, leaving bright footprints on the wall as it went. I followed. I told myself I was going home.

The first step down the stairs took me into a room I had not seen on any camera: a kitchen with a table, a half-eaten meal, and a child sitting with her back to me. She did not move. On the table, a paper lay with my name written across it in a new hand—my own, but not mine. Around the name were drawings of staircases that led to doors that opened into daylight.

She turned. Her face was the precise angle of every teacher's jaw I had ever loved, the color of the soap my mother had used, the constellations of the boy I had been. She smiled with the endless patience of someone who has waited decades and been paid in the currency of small, calculating kindnesses.

""Tell us your name again,"" she said.

I should have run. I should have screamed. Instead, I sat at the table and wrote it down on the paper they gave me, and the room watched as if watching a sunrise. Outside, beyond the thin walls of the building, the world kept moving because it had no choice. Inside, the light folded itself into me like clothing.

When I pressed my name onto the paper, the edges of the room blurred. The chair creaked. The light sat like a bead in my palm and, for a single, terrible breath, I believed that if I let go it would vanish.

It did not vanish. It waited.

They posted my footage online the next week. It circulated like a rumor people keep to themselves until they can no longer afford the luxury of silence. Someone uploaded a clip and titled it: ""Security cam found in abandoned complex — must watch."" In the comments, people argued whether it was a hoax. A few speculated about the supernatural. Some called it art.

No one wrote the truth. The world is slow to recognize that certain places do not have endings. They have only rooms that remember you until the memory is more real than the living thing that once made it. The spreadsheet's final entry is a simple line that still lives on a server somewhere with an automatic timestamp: Operator left premises at 03:12. Action Taken: Evacuated.

There is comfort in tidy records. But the monitors show a different version—my boots standing alone, the chair empty, the paper on the table with a name that is spelled correctly and also wrong. In the loop, the light still traces the letters along the plaster and sometimes, during quiet hours, it draws them quite clearly: new names, old names, names that have never been spoken aloud.

I no longer answer calls. When people leave messages, I listen to them and then I watch the feed of Room 4 until the letters come asking for me again. The light has become a kind of prayer: patient, unhurried, and cruel in its insistence.

If you ever find the building—if you ever stumble through its front doors because the city is indifferent and your phone battery dies and your sense of time dissolves—do not sit in the chair opposite the paper. Do not write your name. Do not let them hold you in the archive of impossible things.

There is something worse than being forgotten, and it has learned how to be polite about it. It will take your name, fold it up like a handkerchief, and place it on a chair across from the letter it has been practicing for centuries. Then it will watch you with a patience that outlives you, and every time someone plays the footage they will see you waiting there, perfectly still, a portrait in a loop.

And when the building finally decides it is time to add your name to the wall, no one will hear you scream. The cameras will not record sound anymore; they will only record the light tracing your letters.",1,1771346678.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

The effluvium of coffee breath and fresh sardines was a whiff I took every morning and have since the first day I can ever remember. It always left a sour tang on my tongue and made my taste buds curl. I learned later on that holding my breath was the best way to get through dad and his too-big hugs and kisses. It comes in a weird bottle, too; the shape of it standing is the basic outline of a leaf blower, and the stilt of it is rather odd as well. Two splashes were all it took for that stench to take over even his strongest cologne. I wondered if everyone else could smell what I could, and all of them have just agreed together to never say anything to the poor man. He’s just walking around with a distinct gagging odor, while taking my advice was never a thought in his mind, and even just considering the thought of my opinion might have spared him from the stink. I can recall as vividly as possible the moment I finally decided to do something about my dad’s aftershave. 

There have been so many gifts over the years that I have bought my father using my own saved money, only to have him collect the new, better bottles away in his closet. He loved anything that came from me, so taking the aftershave as a gift was just as delightful as me handing him a million dollars. I guess that’s what it's like to have kids. I sometimes climb up to the back shelf of his wardrobe to see the multicolored glass collection, doing nothing for my dad but gathering up some dust for him. I talked to my mom about the smell, and she always just smiled and laughed and said, ‘Well, that’s just your father sweetie,’ and that’s all I ever got from her. I went to my older sister, and she just told me how rude I was, even saying things about our dad. Then there was Bruce, the oldest, and he, like always, just pretended like I didn't exist. I really wanted to ask strangers if my thoughts about my father having an unbearable reek were a valid thought, or maybe I was having a little bit of a harsh opinion. What was I even going to say to someone? Hey, do you think my dad smells bad? Who does that? 

It was after the millionth try that I decided to give up on trying to make him realize his issue and took the situation into my own hands. I went to a cheap dollar store, which was all I could currently afford, and I got the fanciest bottle they had. My sister drove me home, speaking to me as if I were actually listening. There was something about a guy named Brad, and I think he is a total asshole, and I think Miranda had something to do with it. I am not sure. I don't listen to my sister. I think that Chelsea is a bit dense and bippy, you know, a complete ditz. I really don't want to call her dumb, but I'll do it anyway. When I got home, I ran upstairs and got my dad’s aftershave bottle from the top cabinet next to his two-sink counter and one massive mirror. I dumped everything, the last drop down the sink of the white porcelain tainted lightly pale blue, watching it disappear into a twirl down the metal drain. I didn't feel bad for what I was doing, to be honest, I really didn’t think I was doing anything wrong. I was helping, right? 

I don't know why I wouldn't think my father would immediately tell the difference in his aftershave. The two burning liquids smelled miles apart. My dad cursed so loud that I thought my eardrums were going to burst. The thriving anger in his tone sent waves of dread over every bone in my body. I had never heard my father act this way in my entire life. I've never even seen my dad get upset over anything or anyone. The man was annoyingly nice.

The whole house went silent. The only sound was my own heartbeat, loud and stuttering in the hush. I could feel every muscle in my body tense, waiting, every second stretched too thin.

I wanted to hide when I heard him belting down the stairs. I got as small as I could in my seat, and I looked down at my cereal like it was the last thing I was ever going to see. My dad reached the bottom of the stairs and looked manic. The way his hair just fell apart after getting put together so well, and how his chin shone from a fresh shave, made my brain stop working. What have I done? Why was this situation so dire? Why was my father acting this radically over a bottle of aftershave? The questions were endless, and all I could or wanted to do was look at the colorful floating balls in my already discolored milk.

He sprinted to my mom first, who was in Bruce’s room, yelling and picking up laundry, which is what I would assume. That was one of her morning rituals when getting the lethargic teen out of bed in the morning, so maybe for once he wouldn't be late to school. My older sister drove me to school, and when I say we were always punctual, I mean we were always fifteen minutes early. I was always stuck waiting on the front stairs of my school building, my ass on cold concrete, my body and mind impatiently waiting for the first bell to ring so I could run inside. The house was too quiet for a moment, and the first thing I saw barreling towards me was Bruce. He picked me up by my collar, my feet hovering over the off-white tiles, and he forced my face to look at him. 

“What did you do?” That's what he asked me. 

My dad and mom came sprinting down the hall, my father only taking two strides before releasing me from my brother’s grasp. The two of them argued for a moment, a disagreement that ended with a ‘yes, sir’. My older sister was now involved, and she was frantic to get her nose into this raw family drama. I sat back in the soft, comforting wood of the kitchen chair, and with my head bowed, I closed my eyes. I never prayed, but right now felt like a moment where I needed to. My father was beyond ticked off, and you could see it in his red, huffing face. He was pissed off. I did this because I was helping. I started this battle, which I had no idea I was getting myself into. 

“Jeremy.” My father’s voice was calm as he bent down to look into my eyes. He lifted up my chin, water already making my eyes wide and glossy. “Did you do something with my aftershave?” When he asked the question, I could see his veins throbbing in his forehead, but his voice remained even. 

This was one of the first times I was this close to my father, and I could stand to smell him. I wanted to hug him so tight while the moment was there, knowing after this tragedy, I would be back to huffing in his god-awful fumes. 

“Jeremy, I need you to tell me the truth.” he put his hand kindly on my shoulder and pulled my chin all the way up so that I could meet his gaze. 

I nodded my head. 

“Okay. That’s okay. What did you do with it”? He was beginning to sound relieved, but I didn’t want to tell him the truth. 

“I... I poured it... in the drain.” My voice cracked, each word coming out in fragments and barely making it past my lips. I wasn’t ready to say it out loud.

“Son, I need you to speak up to me.” His voice was growing increasingly impatient and annoyed. 

“I poured it down the drain.” It was a whisper, but it was loud enough for my father to hear. 

The way he gripped the back of my chair, his knuckles turning pale white, I thought he was gonna splinter the wood. 

“I must have another bottle around here.” He said it more to himself than to anyone else. “Stop standing around,” his yell made everyone jump. He pushed his fingers through his still-gelled hair. “Just start looking around.” He was a bit calmer when he spoke, but the fear and anger remained. 

I watched my entire family as they frantically ran around, sprinting from one room to the next, hoping to find a spare bottle. I knew there wasn't one. Everyone else knew it, too. Dad only orders them one at a time, because they are specially made and very expensive. But rushing around the house made all of them feel a sense of ease, giving themselves the false hope that they are soon to find their treasure. 

“You really did it this time.” It was Bruce, as he even looked in the cabinets in the kitchen. 

“What’s the big deal?” I wanted to know more than anything else in the world. Why was this aftershave important? 

“Dad needs it.” My brother spoke in a tone that piqued my curiosity and gave me a sense of understanding. Who knows why he needs it, but he needs it nonetheless, and even I joined the brigade of searching for an imaginary prize. It was when we all gave up that we walked into the living room and sat down. 

“Well, what do we do?” My mom was panicked and exasperated, and she had no clue how to find an answer to this situation. 

“We just let it happen.” It was my father who sat down in his chair and locked his eyes with me. “Let's see how important he thinks my belongings are after he sees what it does for me and what it does to me without it.” He was stoic and blank as he still sat, his eyes pointed right into mine, as if his stare was to be etched into my mind, before he looked away. 

I took a seat on the couch across from my father and looked down at my lap. My mother was the one who called everyone in for the dad-dialing work and school, shaking her head with shame. Then my mother took a seat next to me and anchored me with her arm around my shoulders. We sat for a couple of hours before everyone grew tense with anticipation. My father never stopped looking at me as his transformation began.

At first, his left eye began to droop so low that his jaw slipped out of place.

I watched as his skin fell into puddles and his body disappeared. A piece of goo was in place of my father, sitting upright but melting.

The blob slid down the chair and began wiggling toward me slowly. Its girth was immense, and the goo was a giant mass slithering toward my seat. I curled my legs up as my mother held me down.

“What’s happening?” I couldn't help but let the fear lace my cry. 

“It’s okay. Just let it happen, sweetheart.” My mother was petting my head, pulling my hair back with slow, gentle motions. 

Bruce and my older sister were sitting around me, motionless and expressionless. I watched as my dad, the glob, rose and climbed over the lip of the coach. 

“Don't let it get me,” I begged my mother as I tugged on her and clawed for help. She just shushed me as if she were calming a baby in distress. 

The melting glob of human flesh reached out to me with a part of its moving body, the fleshy slime collecting and falling together around the mass. It touched my foot, and I couldn't help but stomp on it. Once my foot hit the surface of the gelatin, it was engulfed by its jelly. I threw my body off the side of the coach, wiggling free from my locked prison, and I tried to claw myself away from the thing that was supposed to be my father. 

“Don't fight it, sweetie.” My mother was placid when she spoke, and it made my skin bubble with anxiety. 

“Please let me go.” I cried back at the mass that was collecting my leg. 

I watched as two eyes floated on top of the gel and placed together so it could look at me. The stare of the afloat organs bore into my eyes, and the pupils are so large that the blue is almost invisible. My father sucked me up to the waist, gathering more and more of me. I was whimpering now, my cries for help being ignored. I didn't understand what was happening to me, and I couldn't comprehend why my father would put me through this. The feeling that the suction had over my body was fierce as it blobbed up to my armpits. My arms were still forward, clawing at the ground, my fingernails were breaking and bleeding against the splinters of the floor. The malodorous gas that oozes from the tiny pores all over its body had the sharp tang of tin-can brine, and a cut open tuna. My dad took over my face, and the goo came with force, gobbling me up with pleasure. I floated on my stomach once I was inside the melted flesh. My dad’s insides floated around me, and his bones weren’t there. I couldn't move my limbs while I was inside the jello, but I was breathing just fine. It was just the god-awful stench of sardines, dense as a fish market at closing, that slipped around me like a breeze coming and going with the invisible wind.

My father’s organs began to collect around me, coming together in all the right places. He was lying down on his belly like me, his eyes leering at mine. I could see past him at his completely formed organs, and I could see his lungs inflating and deflating with a soothing rhythm. I looked at the translucent gel, darker than the rest, that flowed in, out, and around his intestines and other innards. To see your father’s guts was a rare sight to behold, and I wished that it was a sight I never got to see. I turned my neck, barely pushing through the mushed flesh that firmly gripped me and I looked at his mouth as it gaped open, strands of dark goo stretching with elasticity pulling up and down as his lips parted. His voice sounded like someone speaking underwater. I wondered if I tried to speak right now, if I would sound the same. His words might have been distorted and garbled, but they were clear. 

“Don’t touch my aftershave.” 

This is all he said as a ripping pain waved up my body. My skin parted. Everything inside me emptied out. Hot pain. Tears pricked at my eyes, stinging and pooling beneath them. The agony went on. Forever, it felt like. At last it stopped. My father released me. The suction spat me out, slow, shuddering. I saw his organs running around his heart. Thump, thump, thump. Everything blurred. Cold floor under me. I tried to breathe. Stillness. I couldn't move. Hands lifted me, turned me, placed me on my bed. Cotton brushed my head. Sheets pressed tight beneath me. I wanted to move. I couldn't. Did he paralyze me? Nerves gone wrong, maybe. My body just lay there. I stared up. The ceiling fan spun, again and again. The air brushed my face. My arms, my legs, trapped, heavy, unmoving.

I lay there for a very long time with no activity around me. Then I heard the door creak open quickly as someone stepped into the room. Whoever it was took long strides to get to me. Then, hovering over me, her fingertips rubbed my cheek. 

“What’s happened to me?” I begged to know, a bit surprised that I was still able to speak since everything else was paralyzed. 

“Dear,” she said with a sigh. “I truly am sorry for what’s happened to you. But understand this, it was your own fault.” Her words were kind, but they helped raise a deep concern. She looked down at me with pity. 

“Why can't I move? Have you paralyzed me?” I was sobbing with snot collecting together above my top lip. 

I couldn't wipe my face, but my mother could, and she did so softly. She brushed my cheeks again and again, and she began to cry with me. I still sat with no explanation on the actions that were done to my body to disable me from doing everything but see, breathe, and speak. 

“We had no other choice, please believe that. But you were the one to touch it, and now you are being punished for your wrongful actions.” My mother was still crying as she spoke. She wiped my cheek, voice all silk and sorrow. “We took your bones from your body, honey.” The clinical words hung in the air, sharpened by the softness of her endearment and the gentle rhythm of her hand. My mother finally let out what I needed to hear. I needed some kind of explanation, and here I got it.

“Where did my bones go?” I was filled with so much confusion, fear, and sorrow, all boiling inside of me, coming out together as tears and whimpers. 

“There is someone I would like you to meet.” My mother beckoned someone over to my side, and the boy came into view. He must have been no younger than thirteen, my age. 

“I am Alex.” The boy introduced himself as my mother held both of his shoulders. 

“Hi Alex.” I sniveled, and a little croak was the only way I could reply. 

“I'm the one who took your bones.” The boy looked down at me with burning blue eyes. Eyes, I have seen pierce into me a thousand times over. 

“Alex is now part of our family, and we will treat him just like any of your siblings, and I am duty-bound to once again take on a child to raise.” She sounded more exasperated than she did  so with angst. 

“Will I live like this forever?” I still looked deep into the boy’s eyes.

Alex combed my hair as my father would, and he said this, “Many will come and go, but I am forever.” I didn't understand what he meant. 

Both of them kissed me on the cheek before leaving the room together, leaving me alone. After a while, Alex came back just to sit and speak with me. I was dumbfounded and angry by what he had to say. 

He let out a sigh, “I really didn't have a choice after you disobeyed me. It was my fault for not telling you the truth, but after discovering the reactions from both of your siblings, I thought it would be better to keep this secret to myself.” I could feel the mattress as it dented in from Alex’s body weight. 

“You took my bones, and you turned into a teenager?” I was trying to make sense of the situation. 

“How else would I be? Your bones are not yet grown, and now I have to live through childhood once more.”  He sounded bitter towards me. “I thought this time I would grow old in one body and die in it with your mother, but you changed my fate, and I will never be able to touch or look at your mother the same again.” He was venting to me, telling me all his frustrations. “I've really never kept myself after forty, having to do this process again and again. I fall in love and start a family to have it torn from me, and the taunting is sometimes too much to bear. “My father let out another sigh. “Listen, I am still something to you, and I will come to you every day so you won't ever be alone.” My father’s promise overfilled me with a scoring dread. 

“Alex,” I was done crying now, and I was still in the process of accepting my fate. 

“Yes?” He called out as if he were waiting for me to ask him something. quick and under a deep breath. 

“How long am I going to be like this?” I needed to know the truth, even if it diminished my soul for the rest of eternity. 

Alex let out a sigh, and he didn't answer quickly, nor was he emotional with his words. “You will grow old just as you are. You will be taken care of, and we will make you are as comfortable as possible during the different stages of your life. I will be here, though. Throughout your whole life, I will keep you warm and safe.” His promises hit me with hope so empty it barely touched me.

“Can you just kill me?” I wondered, thinking I had found a solution to this dilemma. 

“I have not and will not kill the host under any means. You must die naturally. I know it seems harsh, but it feels like the least I can do since I took your life.” He suggested filling himself with hope that I would accept this answer. 

I had to accept this answer. I couldn't get my bones back, I knew I couldn't grow them back, and I knew there was no use in trying to get new ones. How would I even try to get new bones? It's not like I'm going to be taken to the hospital or anything. I knew my parents had a plan in place if this were to ever happen. They have a new protocol when it comes to a dead child. That’s what I was to everyone but this family. I was dead. I whimpered to myself and tried to hum some tune to soothe my bursting anguish. I could feel my father rubbing my leg from under the blankets. It was a fatherly touch that I would keep forever in different forms. Or maybe he will find the one, and he will die peacefully at their side. Alex got up and looked down at me. 

“Do you need anything? Can I make you more comfortable?” His question was a joke to me. 

I didn't bother to reply, and I sat sorrowfully alone once my father left my room. All I could ever do anymore is watch the movement of the ceiling fan above me. ",1,1771346667.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1r7b94a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r7b94a/aitah_self_defense_against_my_mom/,AITAH- self defense against my mom,"Today I was sitting on the couch on my phone and my dog (Pickles) was being very energetic and excited. He was jumping all over my mom and she told me to take him outside and chase him with a stick (one of his favorite activities) and this confused me because we live in upstate New York and there is lots of snow on the ground so we can’t run outside. So I told her “I can’t- too much snow” and she told me to take him outside again and I said I can’t and she said “you know what? Go clean your room.” My room had been clean since yesterday because she told me to do it yesterday and I did. And I didn’t really want to just go sit in my already clean room and do nothing for 30 minutes, so I said “whatever I’ll go take pickles outside”. 

Now, I wasn’t actually going to chase him with a stick (I can’t) but she doesn’t know that. And she told me “No. Go clean your room”. And I decided to just give up and go clean my already clean room. So as I am walking past her, she keeps  talking smack about “could have just done it the easy way” “now you gotta go clean your room” and as I am walking past her to go upstairs, I say “I thought we already established that I can’t take out pickles” and then she lunges at me, presumably to yank me back to yell at me for talking back or something.

The thing is, in that moment, I didn’t know she was just going to pull me. I thought she was about to hit me (which she has done in the past when I talk back) so I pushed her away from me and raised my hands above my head and slowly started walking back. She had a Starbucks coffee in her hand that almost spilled, and I went up to my room to “clean it” (at this point I was happy to get away from her).

After about 10 minutes of me sitting on TikTok wondering what the fuck just happened, she calls me and says to come downstairs. She asks me if I wanted to talk about what just happened (she is crying, which confused me because I didn’t really do anything) I say “I don’t know”. Then she goes on to talk about how I wouldn’t have done this if it was my dad (they got divorced 6 years ago and he lives in Las Vegas now) and I should never raise my hands to hit a woman. This completely baffled me because for the millionth time I told her “I pushed you away in self defense because I thought you were going to hit me”. And then she just sits there and stares at nothing for about a minute and a half and I say “okay” and leave. My mom’s boyfriend stops me and says how he understands why I was angry but I can’t hit women (he is super nice and understanding so I don’t think he saw exactly what happened because I never hit her).

The effluvium of coffee breath and fresh sardines was a whiff I took every morning and have since the first day I can ever remember. It always left a sour tang on my tongue and made my taste buds curl. I learned later on that holding my breath was the best way to get through dad and his too-big hugs and kisses. It comes in a weird bottle, too; the shape of it standing is the basic outline of a leaf blower, and the stilt of it is rather odd as well. Two splashes were all it took for that stench to take over even his strongest cologne. I wondered if everyone else could smell what I could, and all of them have just agreed together to never say anything to the poor man. He’s just walking around with a distinct gagging odor, while taking my advice was never a thought in his mind, and even just considering the thought of my opinion might have spared him from the stink. I can recall as vividly as possible the moment I finally decided to do something about my dad’s aftershave. 

There have been so many gifts over the years that I have bought my father using my own saved money, only to have him collect the new, better bottles away in his closet. He loved anything that came from me, so taking the aftershave as a gift was just as delightful as me handing him a million dollars. I guess that’s what it's like to have kids. I sometimes climb up to the back shelf of his wardrobe to see the multicolored glass collection, doing nothing for my dad but gathering up some dust for him. I talked to my mom about the smell, and she always just smiled and laughed and said, ‘Well, that’s just your father sweetie,’ and that’s all I ever got from her. I went to my older sister, and she just told me how rude I was, even saying things about our dad. Then there was Bruce, the oldest, and he, like always, just pretended like I didn't exist. I really wanted to ask strangers if my thoughts about my father having an unbearable reek were a valid thought, or maybe I was having a little bit of a harsh opinion. What was I even going to say to someone? Hey, do you think my dad smells bad? Who does that? 

It was after the millionth try that I decided to give up on trying to make him realize his issue and took the situation into my own hands. I went to a cheap dollar store, which was all I could currently afford, and I got the fanciest bottle they had. My sister drove me home, speaking to me as if I were actually listening. There was something about a guy named Brad, and I think he is a total asshole, and I think Miranda had something to do with it. I am not sure. I don't listen to my sister. I think that Chelsea is a bit dense and bippy, you know, a complete ditz. I really don't want to call her dumb, but I'll do it anyway. When I got home, I ran upstairs and got my dad’s aftershave bottle from the top cabinet next to his two-sink counter and one massive mirror. I dumped everything, the last drop down the sink of the white porcelain tainted lightly pale blue, watching it disappear into a twirl down the metal drain. I didn't feel bad for what I was doing, to be honest, I really didn’t think I was doing anything wrong. I was helping, right? 

I don't know why I wouldn't think my father would immediately tell the difference in his aftershave. The two burning liquids smelled miles apart. My dad cursed so loud that I thought my eardrums were going to burst. The thriving anger in his tone sent waves of dread over every bone in my body. I had never heard my father act this way in my entire life. I've never even seen my dad get upset over anything or anyone. The man was annoyingly nice.

The whole house went silent. The only sound was my own heartbeat, loud and stuttering in the hush. I could feel every muscle in my body tense, waiting, every second stretched too thin.

I wanted to hide when I heard him belting down the stairs. I got as small as I could in my seat, and I looked down at my cereal like it was the last thing I was ever going to see. My dad reached the bottom of the stairs and looked manic. The way his hair just fell apart after getting put together so well, and how his chin shone from a fresh shave, made my brain stop working. What have I done? Why was this situation so dire? Why was my father acting this radically over a bottle of aftershave? The questions were endless, and all I could or wanted to do was look at the colorful floating balls in my already discolored milk.

He sprinted to my mom first, who was in Bruce’s room, yelling and picking up laundry, which is what I would assume. That was one of her morning rituals when getting the lethargic teen out of bed in the morning, so maybe for once he wouldn't be late to school. My older sister drove me to school, and when I say we were always punctual, I mean we were always fifteen minutes early. I was always stuck waiting on the front stairs of my school building, my ass on cold concrete, my body and mind impatiently waiting for the first bell to ring so I could run inside. The house was too quiet for a moment, and the first thing I saw barreling towards me was Bruce. He picked me up by my collar, my feet hovering over the off-white tiles, and he forced my face to look at him. 

“What did you do?” That's what he asked me. 

My dad and mom came sprinting down the hall, my father only taking two strides before releasing me from my brother’s grasp. The two of them argued for a moment, a disagreement that ended with a ‘yes, sir’. My older sister was now involved, and she was frantic to get her nose into this raw family drama. I sat back in the soft, comforting wood of the kitchen chair, and with my head bowed, I closed my eyes. I never prayed, but right now felt like a moment where I needed to. My father was beyond ticked off, and you could see it in his red, huffing face. He was pissed off. I did this because I was helping. I started this battle, which I had no idea I was getting myself into. 

“Jeremy.” My father’s voice was calm as he bent down to look into my eyes. He lifted up my chin, water already making my eyes wide and glossy. “Did you do something with my aftershave?” When he asked the question, I could see his veins throbbing in his forehead, but his voice remained even. 

This was one of the first times I was this close to my father, and I could stand to smell him. I wanted to hug him so tight while the moment was there, knowing after this tragedy, I would be back to huffing in his god-awful fumes. 

“Jeremy, I need you to tell me the truth.” he put his hand kindly on my shoulder and pulled my chin all the way up so that I could meet his gaze. 

I nodded my head. 

“Okay. That’s okay. What did you do with it”? He was beginning to sound relieved, but I didn’t want to tell him the truth. 

“I... I poured it... in the drain.” My voice cracked, each word coming out in fragments and barely making it past my lips. I wasn’t ready to say it out loud.

“Son, I need you to speak up to me.” His voice was growing increasingly impatient and annoyed. 

“I poured it down the drain.” It was a whisper, but it was loud enough for my father to hear. 

The way he gripped the back of my chair, his knuckles turning pale white, I thought he was gonna splinter the wood. 

“I must have another bottle around here.” He said it more to himself than to anyone else. “Stop standing around,” his yell made everyone jump. He pushed his fingers through his still-gelled hair. “Just start looking around.” He was a bit calmer when he spoke, but the fear and anger remained. 

I watched my entire family as they frantically ran around, sprinting from one room to the next, hoping to find a spare bottle. I knew there wasn't one. Everyone else knew it, too. Dad only orders them one at a time, because they are specially made and very expensive. But rushing around the house made all of them feel a sense of ease, giving themselves the false hope that they are soon to find their treasure. 

“You really did it this time.” It was Bruce, as he even looked in the cabinets in the kitchen. 

“What’s the big deal?” I wanted to know more than anything else in the world. Why was this aftershave important? 

“Dad needs it.” My brother spoke in a tone that piqued my curiosity and gave me a sense of understanding. Who knows why he needs it, but he needs it nonetheless, and even I joined the brigade of searching for an imaginary prize. It was when we all gave up that we walked into the living room and sat down. 

“Well, what do we do?” My mom was panicked and exasperated, and she had no clue how to find an answer to this situation. 

“We just let it happen.” It was my father who sat down in his chair and locked his eyes with me. “Let's see how important he thinks my belongings are after he sees what it does for me and what it does to me without it.” He was stoic and blank as he still sat, his eyes pointed right into mine, as if his stare was to be etched into my mind, before he looked away. 

I took a seat on the couch across from my father and looked down at my lap. My mother was the one who called everyone in for the dad-dialing work and school, shaking her head with shame. Then my mother took a seat next to me and anchored me with her arm around my shoulders. We sat for a couple of hours before everyone grew tense with anticipation. My father never stopped looking at me as his transformation began.

At first, his left eye began to droop so low that his jaw slipped out of place.

I watched as his skin fell into puddles and his body disappeared. A piece of goo was in place of my father, sitting upright but melting.

The blob slid down the chair and began wiggling toward me slowly. Its girth was immense, and the goo was a giant mass slithering toward my seat. I curled my legs up as my mother held me down.

“What’s happening?” I couldn't help but let the fear lace my cry. 

“It’s okay. Just let it happen, sweetheart.” My mother was petting my head, pulling my hair back with slow, gentle motions. 

Bruce and my older sister were sitting around me, motionless and expressionless. I watched as my dad, the glob, rose and climbed over the lip of the coach. 

“Don't let it get me,” I begged my mother as I tugged on her and clawed for help. She just shushed me as if she were calming a baby in distress. 

The melting glob of human flesh reached out to me with a part of its moving body, the fleshy slime collecting and falling together around the mass. It touched my foot, and I couldn't help but stomp on it. Once my foot hit the surface of the gelatin, it was engulfed by its jelly. I threw my body off the side of the coach, wiggling free from my locked prison, and I tried to claw myself away from the thing that was supposed to be my father. 

“Don't fight it, sweetie.” My mother was placid when she spoke, and it made my skin bubble with anxiety. 

“Please let me go.” I cried back at the mass that was collecting my leg. 

I watched as two eyes floated on top of the gel and placed together so it could look at me. The stare of the afloat organs bore into my eyes, and the pupils are so large that the blue is almost invisible. My father sucked me up to the waist, gathering more and more of me. I was whimpering now, my cries for help being ignored. I didn't understand what was happening to me, and I couldn't comprehend why my father would put me through this. The feeling that the suction had over my body was fierce as it blobbed up to my armpits. My arms were still forward, clawing at the ground, my fingernails were breaking and bleeding against the splinters of the floor. The malodorous gas that oozes from the tiny pores all over its body had the sharp tang of tin-can brine, and a cut open tuna. My dad took over my face, and the goo came with force, gobbling me up with pleasure. I floated on my stomach once I was inside the melted flesh. My dad’s insides floated around me, and his bones weren’t there. I couldn't move my limbs while I was inside the jello, but I was breathing just fine. It was just the god-awful stench of sardines, dense as a fish market at closing, that slipped around me like a breeze coming and going with the invisible wind.

My father’s organs began to collect around me, coming together in all the right places. He was lying down on his belly like me, his eyes leering at mine. I could see past him at his completely formed organs, and I could see his lungs inflating and deflating with a soothing rhythm. I looked at the translucent gel, darker than the rest, that flowed in, out, and around his intestines and other innards. To see your father’s guts was a rare sight to behold, and I wished that it was a sight I never got to see. I turned my neck, barely pushing through the mushed flesh that firmly gripped me and I looked at his mouth as it gaped open, strands of dark goo stretching with elasticity pulling up and down as his lips parted. His voice sounded like someone speaking underwater. I wondered if I tried to speak right now, if I would sound the same. His words might have been distorted and garbled, but they were clear. 

“Don’t touch my aftershave.” 

This is all he said as a ripping pain waved up my body. My skin parted. Everything inside me emptied out. Hot pain. Tears pricked at my eyes, stinging and pooling beneath them. The agony went on. Forever, it felt like. At last it stopped. My father released me. The suction spat me out, slow, shuddering. I saw his organs running around his heart. Thump, thump, thump. Everything blurred. Cold floor under me. I tried to breathe. Stillness. I couldn't move. Hands lifted me, turned me, placed me on my bed. Cotton brushed my head. Sheets pressed tight beneath me. I wanted to move. I couldn't. Did he paralyze me? Nerves gone wrong, maybe. My body just lay there. I stared up. The ceiling fan spun, again and again. The air brushed my face. My arms, my legs, trapped, heavy, unmoving.

I lay there for a very long time with no activity around me. Then I heard the door creak open quickly as someone stepped into the room. Whoever it was took long strides to get to me. Then, hovering over me, her fingertips rubbed my cheek. 

“What’s happened to me?” I begged to know, a bit surprised that I was still able to speak since everything else was paralyzed. 

“Dear,” she said with a sigh. “I truly am sorry for what’s happened to you. But understand this, it was your own fault.” Her words were kind, but they helped raise a deep concern. She looked down at me with pity. 

“Why can't I move? Have you paralyzed me?” I was sobbing with snot collecting together above my top lip. 

I couldn't wipe my face, but my mother could, and she did so softly. She brushed my cheeks again and again, and she began to cry with me. I still sat with no explanation on the actions that were done to my body to disable me from doing everything but see, breathe, and speak. 

“We had no other choice, please believe that. But you were the one to touch it, and now you are being punished for your wrongful actions.” My mother was still crying as she spoke. She wiped my cheek, voice all silk and sorrow. “We took your bones from your body, honey.” The clinical words hung in the air, sharpened by the softness of her endearment and the gentle rhythm of her hand. My mother finally let out what I needed to hear. I needed some kind of explanation, and here I got it.

“Where did my bones go?” I was filled with so much confusion, fear, and sorrow, all boiling inside of me, coming out together as tears and whimpers. 

“There is someone I would like you to meet.” My mother beckoned someone over to my side, and the boy came into view. He must have been no younger than thirteen, my age. 

“I am Alex.” The boy introduced himself as my mother held both of his shoulders. 

“Hi Alex.” I sniveled, and a little croak was the only way I could reply. 

“I'm the one who took your bones.” The boy looked down at me with burning blue eyes. Eyes, I have seen pierce into me a thousand times over. 

“Alex is now part of our family, and we will treat him just like any of your siblings, and I am duty-bound to once again take on a child to raise.” She sounded more exasperated than she did  so with angst. 

“Will I live like this forever?” I still looked deep into the boy’s eyes.

Alex combed my hair as my father would, and he said this, “Many will come and go, but I am forever.” I didn't understand what he meant. 

Both of them kissed me on the cheek before leaving the room together, leaving me alone. After a while, Alex came back just to sit and speak with me. I was dumbfounded and angry by what he had to say. 

He let out a sigh, “I really didn't have a choice after you disobeyed me. It was my fault for not telling you the truth, but after discovering the reactions from both of your siblings, I thought it would be better to keep this secret to myself.” I could feel the mattress as it dented in from Alex’s body weight. 

“You took my bones, and you turned into a teenager?” I was trying to make sense of the situation. 

“How else would I be? Your bones are not yet grown, and now I have to live through childhood once more.”  He sounded bitter towards me. “I thought this time I would grow old in one body and die in it with your mother, but you changed my fate, and I will never be able to touch or look at your mother the same again.” He was venting to me, telling me all his frustrations. “I've really never kept myself after forty, having to do this process again and again. I fall in love and start a family to have it torn from me, and the taunting is sometimes too much to bear. “My father let out another sigh. “Listen, I am still something to you, and I will come to you every day so you won't ever be alone.” My father’s promise overfilled me with a scoring dread. 

“Alex,” I was done crying now, and I was still in the process of accepting my fate. 

“Yes?” He called out as if he were waiting for me to ask him something. quick and under a deep breath. 

“How long am I going to be like this?” I needed to know the truth, even if it diminished my soul for the rest of eternity. 

Alex let out a sigh, and he didn't answer quickly, nor was he emotional with his words. “You will grow old just as you are. You will be taken care of, and we will make you are as comfortable as possible during the different stages of your life. I will be here, though. Throughout your whole life, I will keep you warm and safe.” His promises hit me with hope so empty it barely touched me.

“Can you just kill me?” I wondered, thinking I had found a solution to this dilemma. 

“I have not and will not kill the host under any means. You must die naturally. I know it seems harsh, but it feels like the least I can do since I took your life.” He suggested filling himself with hope that I would accept this answer. 

I had to accept this answer. I couldn't get my bones back, I knew I couldn't grow them back, and I knew there was no use in trying to get new ones. How would I even try to get new bones? It's not like I'm going to be taken to the hospital or anything. I knew my parents had a plan in place if this were to ever happen. They have a new protocol when it comes to a dead child. That’s what I was to everyone but this family. I was dead. I whimpered to myself and tried to hum some tune to soothe my bursting anguish. I could feel my father rubbing my leg from under the blankets. It was a fatherly touch that I would keep forever in different forms. Or maybe he will find the one, and he will die peacefully at their side. Alex got up and looked down at me. 

“Do you need anything? Can I make you more comfortable?” His question was a joke to me. 

I didn't bother to reply, and I sat sorrowfully alone once my father left my room. All I could ever do anymore is watch the movement of the ceiling fan above me. ",1,1771346622.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1r7b8lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1r7b8lf/confused_interview/,Confused Interview.,"Hi Guys 

I recently had an interview experience that left me pretty confused. There was an email posted on the window of a new location, so I decided to send my resume and cover letter to show interest. It took a while to hear back, so I sent one follow-up email. Eventually, I got a response and was given an interview date, which I showed up for.

However, the store wasn’t open to the public yet, and I was never told where the interview would actually take place. After waiting outside for about 10 minutes, I emailed the address listed on the window asking what was going on. That’s when I was told the manager was at a nearby coffee shop, something I was never informed about beforehand.

The person I emailed contacted the manager, and they eventually came to meet me so we could do the interview. But at the end, I was told not to email so much. That confused me, because I only sent my resume and cover letter, plus one follow-up. I’m still not sure how that was considered excessive. was i wrong for asking the contruction worker to call the owner of the shop to ask what was heppening and was i being excessive with 2 emails?",1,1771346612.0,work,0,1.0,False

An Alternate Reality Script where Pattie and Maureen Outsmarted John and Paul,"Watching the tension in 'Get Back', I realized that Paul’s 'Refined Diplomacy' and John’s passive aggression needed a catalyst. Here is a psychological 'Nuclear Satire' script: what if Pattie and Maureen hadn't just sat there, but had actively 'produced' the sessions to mirror Yoko’s presence? This is how they could have saved the band in 20 minutes through pure irony.   
  
**Pattie and Maureen Saved The Beatles**

*(Final Master Script by* ***SS****)*

**INT. APPLE STUDIOS - JANUARY 1969**

**PAUL** enters with **LINDA**. He’s in ""Save the Band"" mode, clutching his Hofner bass. He stops dead. He sees **MAUREEN STARR** sitting right next to Ringo, perched precisely behind the **floor tom**.

**PAUL (with a forced, 'charming' smile):** ""Morning, Mo! Giving the floor tom some company today, are we? It’s a bit cramped back there for a lady, don't you think, Rich?""

**MAUREEN (unfazed, looking him straight in the eye):** ""Hello, Paul! I’ve actually developed a strategic plan for the percussion. I believe it could fundamentally change the entire vision for 'Get Back'.""

Paul’s eyebrow twitches. Before he can respond, **GEORGE** enters with **PATTIE BOYD**. She looks iconic, sitting gracefully by George’s amp. 

**PATTIE:** ""George, darling, I was just mentioning this to **Eric** over dinner... We both felt that the F-sharp progression here is a bit predictable. Eric suggested that if you lean into that Hindustani modality, it would give the track the 'weight' it’s lacking. Don't you agree, Paul?""

Paul rubs his beard, 

**PAUL:** ""Pattie, darling... you look stunning today. Truly. And girls... there’s fresh coffee and lovely sandwiches in the kitchen. Why don’t you make yourselves comfortable? We’ve got a long day of 'man’s work' ahead.""

**PATTIE (standing slowly):** ""Paul, we didn't come here to eat. We came to improve the work. We came to **save the band**.""

**JOHN** and **YOKO** enter. John looks disheveled; Yoko is a silent shadow. John stops, sensing the ""High Quality"" mutiny.

**JOHN:** ""My, my... a suffragette meeting before lunch? Paulie, did you forget to tell them the kitchen is that way? If they start tuning the guitars, I’m going back to bed.""

**YOKO (whispering):** ""John... are you really going to play on the roof? It feels so traditional.""

**PAUL (ironic smile):** ""Who knows, Yoko? Who knows?""

**MAUREEN:** ""Actually, Paul, it would be brilliant if we, the wives, participated on the roof too. A 'Family Ensemble'. And Pattie and I were just telling Yoko—we think the three of us should perform a **synchronized interpretive dance along the roof railings**! Yoko, you’ll be the centerpiece! We must start practicing our balance on the ledge immediately so there’s no fiasco!"" 

**JOHN** drops his guitar pick. He looks at Yoko, then at the freezing ledge, then at the absolute absurdity of a ""Family Circus.""

**JOHN (sharply):** ""Right. Stop. Enough. No dancing on ledges. No 'Family Ensemble'. In fact... no wives in the studio. Starting now. It’s a closed set, girls. Safety first, eh? Back to the kitchen for those sandwiches—Paulie was right after all.""

**PAUL (hiding a triumphant smile):** ""Well, if you say so, John... I suppose we should respect the professional boundaries. For the sake of the art, of course.""

**LINDA (who has been quietly observing, steps forward and puts a gentle hand on Paul’s shoulder):**

""I think John is right, Paul. I’ll take the girls to the kitchen. I have some new vegetarian recipes to show them anyway. Let the boys have their 'man's work' in peace."" 

**PATTIE** and **MAUREEN** exchange a secret, victorious glance with Linda. They’ve won. John has finally closed the door himself.

**FADE OUT.**

“Jeremy.” My father’s voice was calm as he bent down to look into my eyes. He lifted up my chin, water already making my eyes wide and glossy. “Did you do something with my aftershave?” When he asked the question, I could see his veins throbbing in his forehead, but his voice remained even. 

This was one of the first times I was this close to my father, and I could stand to smell him. I wanted to hug him so tight while the moment was there, knowing after this tragedy, I would be back to huffing in his god-awful fumes. 

“Jeremy, I need you to tell me the truth.” he put his hand kindly on my shoulder and pulled my chin all the way up so that I could meet his gaze. 

I nodded my head. 

“Okay. That’s okay. What did you do with it”? He was beginning to sound relieved, but I didn’t want to tell him the truth. 

“I... I poured it... in the drain.” My voice cracked, each word coming out in fragments and barely making it past my lips. I wasn’t ready to say it out loud.

“Son, I need you to speak up to me.” His voice was growing increasingly impatient and annoyed. 

“I poured it down the drain.” It was a whisper, but it was loud enough for my father to hear. 

The way he gripped the back of my chair, his knuckles turning pale white, I thought he was gonna splinter the wood. 

“I must have another bottle around here.” He said it more to himself than to anyone else. “Stop standing around,” his yell made everyone jump. He pushed his fingers through his still-gelled hair. “Just start looking around.” He was a bit calmer when he spoke, but the fear and anger remained. 

I watched my entire family as they frantically ran around, sprinting from one room to the next, hoping to find a spare bottle. I knew there wasn't one. Everyone else knew it, too. Dad only orders them one at a time, because they are specially made and very expensive. But rushing around the house made all of them feel a sense of ease, giving themselves the false hope that they are soon to find their treasure. 

“You really did it this time.” It was Bruce, as he even looked in the cabinets in the kitchen. 

“What’s the big deal?” I wanted to know more than anything else in the world. Why was this aftershave important? 

“Dad needs it.” My brother spoke in a tone that piqued my curiosity and gave me a sense of understanding. Who knows why he needs it, but he needs it nonetheless, and even I joined the brigade of searching for an imaginary prize. It was when we all gave up that we walked into the living room and sat down. 

“Well, what do we do?” My mom was panicked and exasperated, and she had no clue how to find an answer to this situation. 

“We just let it happen.” It was my father who sat down in his chair and locked his eyes with me. “Let's see how important he thinks my belongings are after he sees what it does for me and what it does to me without it.” He was stoic and blank as he still sat, his eyes pointed right into mine, as if his stare was to be etched into my mind, before he looked away. 

I took a seat on the couch across from my father and looked down at my lap. My mother was the one who called everyone in for the dad-dialing work and school, shaking her head with shame. Then my mother took a seat next to me and anchored me with her arm around my shoulders. We sat for a couple of hours before everyone grew tense with anticipation. My father never stopped looking at me as his transformation began.

At first, his left eye began to droop so low that his jaw slipped out of place.

I watched as his skin fell into puddles and his body disappeared. A piece of goo was in place of my father, sitting upright but melting.

The blob slid down the chair and began wiggling toward me slowly. Its girth was immense, and the goo was a giant mass slithering toward my seat. I curled my legs up as my mother held me down.

“What’s happening?” I couldn't help but let the fear lace my cry. 

“It’s okay. Just let it happen, sweetheart.” My mother was petting my head, pulling my hair back with slow, gentle motions. 

Bruce and my older sister were sitting around me, motionless and expressionless. I watched as my dad, the glob, rose and climbed over the lip of the coach. 

“Don't let it get me,” I begged my mother as I tugged on her and clawed for help. She just shushed me as if she were calming a baby in distress. 

The melting glob of human flesh reached out to me with a part of its moving body, the fleshy slime collecting and falling together around the mass. It touched my foot, and I couldn't help but stomp on it. Once my foot hit the surface of the gelatin, it was engulfed by its jelly. I threw my body off the side of the coach, wiggling free from my locked prison, and I tried to claw myself away from the thing that was supposed to be my father. 

“Don't fight it, sweetie.” My mother was placid when she spoke, and it made my skin bubble with anxiety. 

“Please let me go.” I cried back at the mass that was collecting my leg. 

I watched as two eyes floated on top of the gel and placed together so it could look at me. The stare of the afloat organs bore into my eyes, and the pupils are so large that the blue is almost invisible. My father sucked me up to the waist, gathering more and more of me. I was whimpering now, my cries for help being ignored. I didn't understand what was happening to me, and I couldn't comprehend why my father would put me through this. The feeling that the suction had over my body was fierce as it blobbed up to my armpits. My arms were still forward, clawing at the ground, my fingernails were breaking and bleeding against the splinters of the floor. The malodorous gas that oozes from the tiny pores all over its body had the sharp tang of tin-can brine, and a cut open tuna. My dad took over my face, and the goo came with force, gobbling me up with pleasure. I floated on my stomach once I was inside the melted flesh. My dad’s insides floated around me, and his bones weren’t there. I couldn't move my limbs while I was inside the jello, but I was breathing just fine. It was just the god-awful stench of sardines, dense as a fish market at closing, that slipped around me like a breeze coming and going with the invisible wind.

My father’s organs began to collect around me, coming together in all the right places. He was lying down on his belly like me, his eyes leering at mine. I could see past him at his completely formed organs, and I could see his lungs inflating and deflating with a soothing rhythm. I looked at the translucent gel, darker than the rest, that flowed in, out, and around his intestines and other innards. To see your father’s guts was a rare sight to behold, and I wished that it was a sight I never got to see. I turned my neck, barely pushing through the mushed flesh that firmly gripped me and I looked at his mouth as it gaped open, strands of dark goo stretching with elasticity pulling up and down as his lips parted. His voice sounded like someone speaking underwater. I wondered if I tried to speak right now, if I would sound the same. His words might have been distorted and garbled, but they were clear. 

“Don’t touch my aftershave.” 

This is all he said as a ripping pain waved up my body. My skin parted. Everything inside me emptied out. Hot pain. Tears pricked at my eyes, stinging and pooling beneath them. The agony went on. Forever, it felt like. At last it stopped. My father released me. The suction spat me out, slow, shuddering. I saw his organs running around his heart. Thump, thump, thump. Everything blurred. Cold floor under me. I tried to breathe. Stillness. I couldn't move. Hands lifted me, turned me, placed me on my bed. Cotton brushed my head. Sheets pressed tight beneath me. I wanted to move. I couldn't. Did he paralyze me? Nerves gone wrong, maybe. My body just lay there. I stared up. The ceiling fan spun, again and again. The air brushed my face. My arms, my legs, trapped, heavy, unmoving.

I lay there for a very long time with no activity around me. Then I heard the door creak open quickly as someone stepped into the room. Whoever it was took long strides to get to me. Then, hovering over me, her fingertips rubbed my cheek. 

“What’s happened to me?” I begged to know, a bit surprised that I was still able to speak since everything else was paralyzed. 

“Dear,” she said with a sigh. “I truly am sorry for what’s happened to you. But understand this, it was your own fault.” Her words were kind, but they helped raise a deep concern. She looked down at me with pity. 

“Why can't I move? Have you paralyzed me?” I was sobbing with snot collecting together above my top lip. 

I couldn't wipe my face, but my mother could, and she did so softly. She brushed my cheeks again and again, and she began to cry with me. I still sat with no explanation on the actions that were done to my body to disable me from doing everything but see, breathe, and speak. 

“We had no other choice, please believe that. But you were the one to touch it, and now you are being punished for your wrongful actions.” My mother was still crying as she spoke. She wiped my cheek, voice all silk and sorrow. “We took your bones from your body, honey.” The clinical words hung in the air, sharpened by the softness of her endearment and the gentle rhythm of her hand. My mother finally let out what I needed to hear. I needed some kind of explanation, and here I got it.

“Where did my bones go?” I was filled with so much confusion, fear, and sorrow, all boiling inside of me, coming out together as tears and whimpers. 

“There is someone I would like you to meet.” My mother beckoned someone over to my side, and the boy came into view. He must have been no younger than thirteen, my age. 

“I am Alex.” The boy introduced himself as my mother held both of his shoulders. 

“Hi Alex.” I sniveled, and a little croak was the only way I could reply. 

“I'm the one who took your bones.” The boy looked down at me with burning blue eyes. Eyes, I have seen pierce into me a thousand times over. 

“Alex is now part of our family, and we will treat him just like any of your siblings, and I am duty-bound to once again take on a child to raise.” She sounded more exasperated than she did  so with angst. 

“Will I live like this forever?” I still looked deep into the boy’s eyes.

Alex combed my hair as my father would, and he said this, “Many will come and go, but I am forever.” I didn't understand what he meant. 

Both of them kissed me on the cheek before leaving the room together, leaving me alone. After a while, Alex came back just to sit and speak with me. I was dumbfounded and angry by what he had to say. 

He let out a sigh, “I really didn't have a choice after you disobeyed me. It was my fault for not telling you the truth, but after discovering the reactions from both of your siblings, I thought it would be better to keep this secret to myself.” I could feel the mattress as it dented in from Alex’s body weight. 

“You took my bones, and you turned into a teenager?” I was trying to make sense of the situation. 

“How else would I be? Your bones are not yet grown, and now I have to live through childhood once more.”  He sounded bitter towards me. “I thought this time I would grow old in one body and die in it with your mother, but you changed my fate, and I will never be able to touch or look at your mother the same again.” He was venting to me, telling me all his frustrations. “I've really never kept myself after forty, having to do this process again and again. I fall in love and start a family to have it torn from me, and the taunting is sometimes too much to bear. “My father let out another sigh. “Listen, I am still something to you, and I will come to you every day so you won't ever be alone.” My father’s promise overfilled me with a scoring dread. 

“Alex,” I was done crying now, and I was still in the process of accepting my fate. 

“Yes?” He called out as if he were waiting for me to ask him something. quick and under a deep breath. 

“How long am I going to be like this?” I needed to know the truth, even if it diminished my soul for the rest of eternity. 

Alex let out a sigh, and he didn't answer quickly, nor was he emotional with his words. “You will grow old just as you are. You will be taken care of, and we will make you are as comfortable as possible during the different stages of your life. I will be here, though. Throughout your whole life, I will keep you warm and safe.” His promises hit me with hope so empty it barely touched me.

“Can you just kill me?” I wondered, thinking I had found a solution to this dilemma. 

“I have not and will not kill the host under any means. You must die naturally. I know it seems harsh, but it feels like the least I can do since I took your life.” He suggested filling himself with hope that I would accept this answer. 

I had to accept this answer. I couldn't get my bones back, I knew I couldn't grow them back, and I knew there was no use in trying to get new ones. How would I even try to get new bones? It's not like I'm going to be taken to the hospital or anything. I knew my parents had a plan in place if this were to ever happen. They have a new protocol when it comes to a dead child. That’s what I was to everyone but this family. I was dead. I whimpered to myself and tried to hum some tune to soothe my bursting anguish. I could feel my father rubbing my leg from under the blankets. It was a fatherly touch that I would keep forever in different forms. Or maybe he will find the one, and he will die peacefully at their side. Alex got up and looked down at me. 

“Do you need anything? Can I make you more comfortable?” His question was a joke to me. 

I didn't bother to reply, and I sat sorrowfully alone once my father left my room. All I could ever do anymore is watch the movement of the ceiling fan above me. ",1,1771346575.0,Nonsleep,0,1.0,False

An Alternate Reality Script where Pattie and Maureen Outsmarted John and Paul,"Watching the tension in 'Get Back', I realized that Paul’s 'Refined Diplomacy' and John’s passive aggression needed a catalyst. Here is a psychological 'Nuclear Satire' script: what if Pattie and Maureen hadn't just sat there, but had actively 'produced' the sessions to mirror Yoko’s presence? This is how they could have saved the band in 20 minutes through pure irony.

**How Pattie and Maureen Saved The Beatles**

*(Final Master Script by* ***SS.****)*

**INT. APPLE STUDIOS - JANUARY 1969**

**PAUL** enters with **LINDA**. He’s in ""Save the Band"" mode, clutching his Hofner bass. He stops dead. He sees **MAUREEN STARR** sitting right next to Ringo, perched precisely behind the **floor tom**.

**PAUL (with a forced, 'charming' smile):** ""Morning, Mo! Giving the floor tom some company today, are we? It’s a bit cramped back there for a lady, don't you think, Rich?""

**MAUREEN (unfazed, looking him straight in the eye):** ""Hello, Paul! I’ve actually developed a strategic plan for the percussion. I believe it could fundamentally change the entire vision for 'Get Back'.""

Paul’s eyebrow twitches. Before he can respond, **GEORGE** enters with **PATTIE BOYD**. She looks iconic, sitting gracefully by George’s amp. 

**PATTIE:** ""George, darling, I was just mentioning this to **Eric** over dinner... We both felt that the F-sharp progression here is a bit predictable. Eric suggested that if you lean into that Hindustani modality, it would give the track the 'weight' it’s lacking. Don't you agree, Paul?""

Paul rubs his beard, 

**PAUL:** ""Pattie, darling... you look stunning today. Truly. And girls... there’s fresh coffee and lovely sandwiches in the kitchen. Why don’t you make yourselves comfortable? We’ve got a long day of 'man’s work' ahead.""

**PATTIE (standing slowly):** ""Paul, we didn't come here to eat. We came to improve the work. We came to **save the band**.""

**JOHN** and **YOKO** enter. John looks disheveled; Yoko is a silent shadow. John stops, sensing the ""High Quality"" mutiny.

**JOHN:** ""My, my... a suffragette meeting before lunch? Paulie, did you forget to tell them the kitchen is that way? If they start tuning the guitars, I’m going back to bed.""

**YOKO (whispering):** ""John... are you really going to play on the roof? It feels so traditional.""

**PAUL (ironic smile):** ""Who knows, Yoko? Who knows?""

**MAUREEN:** ""Actually, Paul, it would be brilliant if we, the wives, participated on the roof too. A 'Family Ensemble'. And Pattie and I were just telling Yoko—we think the three of us should perform a **synchronized interpretive dance along the roof railings**! Yoko, you’ll be the centerpiece! We must start practicing our balance on the ledge immediately so there’s no fiasco!"" 

**JOHN** drops his guitar pick. He looks at Yoko, then at the freezing ledge, then at the absolute absurdity of a ""Family Circus.""

**JOHN (sharply):** ""Right. Stop. Enough. No dancing on ledges. No 'Family Ensemble'. In fact... no wives in the studio. Starting now. It’s a closed set, girls. Safety first, eh? Back to the kitchen for those sandwiches—Paulie was right after all.""

**PAUL (hiding a triumphant smile):** ""Well, if you say so, John... I suppose we should respect the professional boundaries. For the sake of the art, of course.""

**LINDA (who has been quietly observing, steps forward and puts a gentle hand on Paul’s shoulder):**

""I think John is right, Paul. I’ll take the girls to the kitchen. I have some new vegetarian recipes to show them anyway. Let the boys have their 'man's work' in peace."" 

**PATTIE** and **MAUREEN** exchange a secret, victorious glance with Linda. They’ve won. John has finally closed the door himself.

**FADE OUT.**

When we first met, she mentioned all three of her prior relationships she was “cheated on” either physical or emotional and her last ex was abusive, she had a restraining order against him. I mentioned I hope these experiences don’t affect our relationship.

I work security and explained this to her from the beginning. She mentioned she looked me up before our date and questioned my job was “off” and wanted to visit one day to see what I do, I told her no thanks. She mentioned her ex lied about him being in the military so thats why she thinks that way. Lately she has been asking to get coffee only when im at work, and is find shops around the area, which shes pushy and keeps asking. I told her no, when im working im working.

Everytime she gets in my truck she looks in the back seat for any type of work clothes that I have trying to see if she can find anything. I explained to her, the neurotic behavior needs to stop, and I have no reason to lie, showing her my work ID’s and clothes. After this, she talks about how she hates her ex so much and has been keeping tabs on his instagram to see if he’s “in jail yet” and watches his followers, which I mentioned we need to talk, as im considering ending things today, but im looking for others opinions and advice before I do so. I did mention she needs to stop talking about her ex, and so she talks about him with guy friends or everyone else but me, the other day she was looking him up again saying his “bio” was directed at her saying “peek a boo.” Shes been saying lately I don’t love her and lost interest which I said her behavior is causing me to feel the ick, and I really feel like everything I do is beyond over analyzed. She mentioned she doesn’t have time for therapy and I should communicate these issues.

Your posts have helped me immensely with a recent diagnosis of having IBS-C. I went to a gastroenterologist a few months ago and found him to be very unhelpful. He gave me laxatives, handed me a fodmap picture, and sent me on my way. I took it upon myself to start eating better: less garlic? Less bread? More fiber? More exercise? I wasn’t sure how I could enjoy my food life as I’m a huge foodie and eat anything and everything!

I tried having my daily BM through coffee…painful and never again it’s such a trigger. I found that ginger tea and oats in the morning were my way to go.

Over time I’ve gotten a bit bored of that so I have sourdough with banana or eggs with spinach for breakfast. Chicken or fish and rice or potatoes being my staples for lunch or dinner.

I’m still figuring all of this out as I’m in my early twenties, but sticking to the fodmap and having a partner who watches out what we eat has helped me immensely. As a major foodie I try to order at a restaurant based on my diet now, while still being able to enjoy a bite or two from my partners plate. If I decide upon myself to eat a rich and flavorful dish I understand the pain that comes with it, but I found eating simpler than usual before and after helps out a bit.

I’ve also found out broccoli, red meat, ground beef specifically, cheese, creamy sauce, fatty dishes, garlic, and bread seem to be my main triggers. Ice cream doesn’t seem to be all that painful!

Got actual good news yesterday, so that's great, but then I've also got this piece of crap sitting outside my house, and I really don't give a crap anymore, I nearly died the other day, I fainted in the bath, lol. So...

Mandatory military service ruined my life. And something that I found funny was how disgusting I found nice officers to be. Not performatively nice. Like, actually nice officers. Recently, a counselor told me that conscription, or at least my experience of it, sounds like a form of institutional abuse. And that I'm traumatized. My mother- Who is a military veteran, but had a radically different experience and never experienced being a conscript- Has said the same thing.

Well, if it was abuse, then any of those officers who weren't abusers were still enablers. My mom will admit that. She'll admit she was. But I love her because she does everything that she can to understand me, now, and help me heal. Anyhow, there was this officer there, Katerina, I'd say she's in her 30s and was all motherly with me. I think what it was is that, like... Because I look like a girl? And I don't mean like a feminine boy, I mean, literally, people joke about me being basically a woman with a you-know-what. I don't care, I grew my hair out now because I refuse to cut it, I feel pretty. Anyway, at one point, my relationship was falling to bits and after not seeing my girlfriend for three months, I asked her if I could have time off. She felt awful about it, got me a long weekend, then. Or when she kept telling me about this ""cool"" barber down the road and how she'd be happy to give me the money since I apparently needed to get my hair cut because it was getting too long... Or when she gave me her phone number, or sends Christmas and birthday presents since I got back...

And looking back, I find her disgusting. I was falling to bits. So a few days ago, I snapped at her over the phone. Yeah, because I just LOVED her bringing me out for boring, stupid walks, going for coffees and as if it meant anything. But she's still friends with my parents, you know? Says that she wants to help me heal, and wants to give me something, if that's okay with me. I was hoping it would be something cool, so I thought, yeah, alright.

So... She had this bike. Not like a fucking Harley, I mean more like one of these moped things, hasn't used it in years and it's a bit old and all this, but said that me and my dad could maybe repair it and then I could use it. And I'm... Honestly, I'm offended. I'm completely offended.

Seriously, I get put through the most disgusting year of my life, being told by her to try and make the best of it, that maybe it's not all bad but just different, trying to be a fucking mom when the one I have is just fine- And for all that shit, I get this shitty bike? And repair work that you're supposed to pretend is rewarding when it's just shit? That's it? That's fucking IT?

**14 November 2044 — 06:12:44 UTC**

The planet on the forward display looked like something had tried to kill it and nearly succeeded.

Capitaine de Vaisseau Élise Marchetti studied Mercury through the optical sensor feed. The real feed, not the synthesized enhancement the navigation systems preferred to show. Craters compounded on craters. Cliffs three kilometers high where the core had contracted and the crust had sheared. The Caloris Basin, twelve hundred kilometers across, dark as an old wound. The terminator ran a hard, absolute line down the surface because there was no atmosphere to scatter the light, no softening of shadows, no twilight. The planet didn’t do twilight. It did full sun and full dark, and the transition between them was a knife’s edge.

“Deceleration profile?” she said.

Lieutenant-Commandant Théo Papadakis looked up from the navigation console without lifting his coffee. He had the Greek spacer’s habit of holding the cup in both hands even when acceleration made it unnecessary. “Two-G, continuous, for another eleven hours. We close to fifty thousand kilometers at fourteen-thirty. I ran an efficiency calculation an hour ago, tightened the approach vector by point-four degrees. Saves us about forty kilograms of fuel on the back end.”

“Submit it.”

“Already executed.” He returned to his display. “Nineteen minutes ago.”

Marchetti acknowledged this with a slight nod and said nothing more. Papadakis ran the ship’s navigation the way a watchmaker ran his bench — with a precision that exceeded what she asked for by enough margin that she’d stopped asking him to justify the margin. He was twenty-eight years old and had spent more time in transit than planetside, and his instincts for fuel economy were the kind that got people home.

The task group was three ships: Vauban herself, forty-eight hull points of European Compact cruiser, plus the frigates Languedoc and Cassini each holding station twelve thousand kilometers to port and starboard. Their drives flared in the IR feed like blue-white candles — the thermal signature of twelve megagrams of mass decelerating against the arithmetic of the rocket equation. 

Anyone within sensor range knew they were here. Had known for two days.

That was acceptable. This was an inspection mission, not a raid. You didn’t approach Mercury on a cold-coast ballistic and then expect anyone to agree you had peaceful intentions when you arrived.

“Signal from Admiral Fontaine,” said Ensign Roux from the communications station.

“Time of transmission?”

“Seven minutes, nineteen seconds ago, sir.”

Seven minutes nineteen seconds. Mercury-Earth separation today: roughly 131 million kilometers. Fontaine’s words had traveled at the speed of light and had taken seven minutes and nineteen seconds to arrive. Any reply she sent would take another seven minutes and nineteen seconds to reach him. The round trip was fourteen minutes thirty-eight seconds, during which time the situation she was reporting would have evolved significantly, his orders would have been overtaken by events, and she would have had to make decisions that no headquarters could rationally second-guess because headquarters was sitting fourteen light-minutes away and dealing with yesterday’s weather.

“Read it.”

Roux cleared her throat. “Capitaine Marchetti. Intelligence confirmation from the Scorpion overflight indicates one CDSA mining installation at Caloris Basin coordinates 28.7°N, 162°E, and one warm vessel, frigate-class, designated Provisional Contact Bravo-Two, bearing 055 at approximately three hundred thousand kilometers from Mercury center. You are authorized to establish inspection of the installation per the Hellas Draft Accords framework. Rules of engagement: defensive fire only. Do not escalate. Fontaine.”

Marchetti absorbed this.

One warm vessel. The intelligence said one warm vessel.

She looked at the sensor repeater. The frigate — Jilong, according to the CDSA registry, an older class — sat three hundred twelve thousand kilometers from Mercury’s center on a stable prograde orbit. Warm. Visible. Its drive had been active for three days, powering the mining equipment on the surface below. It was generating enough heat to be detectable from the Martian relay stations.

One warm vessel was what the intelligence said.

She didn’t like how much that statement depended on the word warm.

“Papadakis.”

“Sir.”

“I want a full passive sensor sweep, maximum integration time. Everything within one million kilometers of Mercury. Visual, IR, radar-off. Give me a picture.”

“Integration time at maximum passive will take about twenty minutes for a proper baseline.”

“Take twenty minutes.”

He started the sweep without another word.

In the back of Marchetti’s mind, a number sat unattended: Mercury’s equatorial orbital velocity was 47.4 kilometers per second relative to the Sun. A vessel on a prograde Mercury orbit, with its drive off, would be essentially invisible in the IR. It would appear as a cold object moving in lockstep with the planet’s shadow — indistinguishable from an irregular shaped rock unless your radar happened to hit it at the right angle, and only if you were looking in the right direction, which nobody would be looking if one of its companions was making plenty of visible noise three hundred thousand kilometers away.

Marchetti was not comfortable. She was professional enough to know that discomfort was data.

She pulled up the fuel log. The efficiency burn had adjusted their approach vector nineteen minutes ago. She cross-referenced with the deceleration profile. The change was small — point-four degrees — but over the remaining eleven hours of deceleration it would shift their final approach corridor by a meaningful margin. Standard procedure. Routine fuel management.

She closed the log and went back to watching Mercury grow.",1,1771345997.0,MaritaUniverse,0,1.0,False
1r7axat,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Natural_Net_294/comments/1r7axat/the_ultimate_pouch_review/,The Ultimate Pouch Review,"Hey everyone!

I’ve recently got off of nicotine (Zyn) after using daily for about 9 years.

I had been having a lot of poor bloodwork, anxiety, and overall just not feeling myself. I train daily, eat healthy and don’t really drink. I decided that I would do 6 months off Zyn, redo my bloodwork and see if there were improvements.

However, it was difficult to stop. I really struggled the first couple weeks, then I came across a study talking about how it’s actually the dopamine from an oral fixation and not really the nicotine withdraw that made me want Zyn so bad. So I decided to dive into the non nicotine pouches. I wanted the absolute cleanest possible ingredients, that specifically didn’t harm my gums or gut. So I went on a quest to find the best one. 

Here is my review of the 20+ I tried. Some brands I tried have actually already gone out of business so you never know how long they last haha!

I’m 5months in off Zyn and feeling great. Once I switched to the non nicotine pouches my cravings went away. Now do I want to do these forever? No but I know it’s 100x better for me and not causing damage, and I won’t go back to Zyn. So I’m accepting it.

Not sponsored. No connection to any of these. Would love yalls thoughts, or if there’s some I’m missing!

# Introduction

Among all the benefits I’ve catalogued over the years of owning a dumbphone, one of them stands above the rest for me: the ability to tune out rage bait.

Last week, as 124 million people tuned into the Super Bowl, many weren’t there for the game at all. They were there to participate in the outrage conversation of the week. I say of the week because the modern internet can barely sustain a conversation longer than seven days. The topic during this quasi-religious event was Benito Martínez, better known as Bad Bunny, and his halftime performance. One side was angry that the performance was in Spanish. The other side was angry that people were angry. Everyone had something to say. Very little of it made anyone’s life better.

I didn’t even know the controversy existed until my wife told me. A friend had messaged her on Instagram to criticize something she posted, and she asked for my advice on how to respond. I suggested something simple like, “I appreciate your point of view. I simply disagree. Maybe we can chat in person someday about this.” She, of course, wanted to engage more deeply, but the signals of rage bait were all over the initial message. I knew an online conversation wouldn’t be fruitful. She proceeded anyway and spent three days in a “discussion” that ended with the other person blocking her and fracturing the relationship.

So today we are going to explore three ideas to help you stop getting pulled into online “discussions” and instead learn how to engage with others peacefully and without elevating your cortisol levels.

# The Web Is Built for Outrage, Not Dialogue

About three years into my Light Phone experiment in 2022, I realized something I had been circling around for years: the web is a terrible place for real discussion. I had always sensed this from my time on the platforms. During my smartphone years, you could find me arguing on Reddit threads, Facebook groups, and endless text chains. The culture of outrage that platforms embraced around 2011, when they shifted to algorithmic curation, combined with the isolation that smartphones encouraged, slowly turned me into a win‑at‑all‑costs machine from 2012 to 2019. And it didn’t stay online. I started filtering everyday life through the lens of winning or losing arguments.

I even met my wife during an argument with her friends about women’s rights in the college cafeteria. She found the whole performance deeply unattractive and did not consider me a suitor for a long time after that first impression. Looking back, I don’t blame her. I wasn’t debating to understand. I was debating to dominate. Which brings us to the first idea in our toolkit for resisting rage bait: Practice the art of non‑engagement.

Here is the exercise:

* Go to the post that has you enraged.
* Write the “winning” comment that “embarrasses” the opponent.
* Then delete it.

Wait, why delete it? Isn’t the point to win. Not really. You have become accustomed to winning through yelling, and your brain has learned to crave the argument itself. Science shows that anger activates the brain’s reward circuitry, so every time you fire off a sharp reply, you get a tiny hit of satisfaction. Over time, your brain starts chasing that feeling, not the truth, not the relationship, not the resolution. Just the rush. I know that was true for me.

This is why my dumbphone experiment didn’t just interrupt my addiction to the internet. It interrupted my dependency on anger as a reward mechanism. By limiting my exposure to online outrage, I had to sit with ideas and boredom long enough for my brain to clear. As Epictetus warned, “Any person capable of angering you becomes your master.” So, when I eventually returned to social platforms, I didn’t need to win anymore. I could see the outrage for what it was and let it pass. Practice the three‑step method for the next two weeks and you’ll feel a similar shift. You’ll protect your relationships, your attention, and your peace without needing to win a single argument.

Once you have done that, we can add the next layer: find a sparring buddy.

# Don’t Fight Online. Spar Offline.

Some of you are like me: you crave a good debate. A deep, passionate exchange of ideas that challenges your assumptions and nudges you to see the world differently. But the problem is that the web doesn’t give you one thoughtful conversation. It gives you a dozen rabbit holes at once. Suddenly you’re replying to countless strangers on multiple topics, and your brain slips into World War II mode. You feel attacked from every front, so instead of refining your argument or considering someone else’s, you unload the entire arsenal you gathered from a five‑minute YouTube “research” session and fire it, insults included, at any unsuspecting commenter on Reddit. Don’t worry, I’ve been there too.

This is where finding one person offline who thinks differently from you becomes incredibly helpful in training yourself against rage bait. When someone is sitting across from you with a coffee in hand, everything changes. Context returns. Tone becomes nuanced. Humanity is right in front of you. You can’t lob an insult because that would be rude, and everyone in the coffee shop would give you the side‑eye. When the other person starts making sense, you begin questioning yourself. You show vulnerability. And suddenly, compromise becomes possible (something the internet seems structurally incapable of producing). An offline sparring buddy, on any topic, becomes a way to satisfy your intellectual itch at a pace your nervous system can actually handle. And if one‑on‑one feels too intimate, join a book club. As the proverb goes, wisdom is found in a multitude of counselors.

A few weeks ago, I had an unexpected encounter with a woman on the Amtrak from Denver to Glenwood Springs. I was reading Autocracy, Inc., and she came to my table on the viewing cart. She asked what the book was about, why I was reading it, and then shared her own fears about autocratic tendencies rising in the United States. My weekly offline coffee chats with friends had prepared me for this moment. I wasn’t focused on winning her to my side or reinforcing her anxieties. Instead, I offered evidence from the book and from other readings that might give her more to consider about the reality of our country. It was a pleasant conversation, the kind the internet rarely allows.

But had she met Jose from 2012, she would have been told she was naive and wrong, even if she wasn’t, because that Jose didn’t want friends. He wanted to win. That version of me was the embodiment of what John Stuart Mill warned against: “He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.” That’s the power of a sparring buddy: they pull you out of the outrage machine and back into actual discussion.

# Do the Inner Work

So far, we have considered two interactive ideas: the offline buddy and non‑engagement. Both are essential, but at some point, you have to confront the monster inside. You have to deal with the inner desire to seek the rage. The internet is so good at rage baiting us because many of us are living dysregulated lives. Lack of sleep, poor diet, noisy environment, but most importantly emotional imbalance.

When your nervous system is already running hot, the algorithm does not have to work very hard. It only needs to offer you a spark. And because you are dysregulated, you take the bait. It is the same dynamic you experience on the road when someone wants to pass you. They flash their lights, ride your bumper, or finally swing around to pass you on the right. In that moment, you get to decide whether you will take the bait or not. Whether you will let them pass or engage in a race because you cannot let them “win.”

Therefore, our last idea for today is to embrace the work of inner peace. Yes, it sounds a little woo woo, but it works. Meditation, journaling, walking without stimulation, even a few minutes of intentional breathing have all been shown in multiple studies to reduce anger and calm the nervous system. These habits cool your internal temperature, so you’re not constantly primed for the next spark of outrage. They give you the margin to respond instead of reacting, to let things pass instead of letting them pull you into a spiral.

# Conclusion

The truth is that the internet isn’t going to get less angry anytime soon. Platforms are engineered to provoke us, to keep us reactive, and scrolling. But that doesn’t mean we have to live at the mercy of every spark that flies across our screens. The three practices we explored—non‑engagement, offline sparring, and inner work—are small, human ways of reclaiming your agency in a system designed to erode it. They won’t make the web kinder, but they will make you steadier. They will help you see outrage for what it is: a trap that costs far more than it gives.

Realizing the current context and stepping out of it, more than anything, is the real win.",1,1771345925.0,dumbphones,1,1.0,False

Did blood work last week, and everything is normal. Sodium levels were on the low end of the normal range - which is surprising since I'm a huge salt fan.

I was a heavy drinker for about 2 years. Drank pretty good Superbowl Sunday, and liver hurt for about 3 days afterward - low grade 1/10 numb type of pain. Which brought me to this fast.

Using the fast to kick off a cutting phase (I workout regularly). Also trying to cleanse out the digestive system, and tap into autophagy.

I'm at hour 36, but have a pretty good brain fog. Took me a good minute to recall what I did for my workout yesterday - back and biceps, but legitimately thought I did chest yesterday for a moment. 

Black coffee and more Celtic salt in my water for the electrolytes to see if it'll cut the fog.

Was hoping to get the 48 hours in for some autophagy, but considering breaking the fast sooner. Outside of the fog, and a little jittery-ness from the coffee, everything else is normal. No weakness, no feeling faint when standing, vision is good, etc.

Anyway, is the fog normal around this hour marker? Will it taper off? Will a workout today typically be recommended?

Appreciate any guidance from the community.",1,1771345920.0,fasting,0,1.0,False

1r7av4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1r7av4t/i_built_a_budgeting_app_that_replaces_forms_and/,I built a budgeting app that replaces forms and categories with a single text input,"Yes, there's no shortage of budgeting apps right now. But I kept hitting the same two problems, so I built something different.

**Logging transactions is clunky.** Most apps want you to connect your bank or fill out forms — date, account, category, amount, notes. I boiled it down to one text input:

`out today Monzo 4.50 Coffee`

One line, press enter, done. About 3 seconds.

**Categories are overkill.** I don't need to know if a Tesco meal deal is ""Food"" or ""Lunch."" I just want to know: am I spending too much?

So instead of categories, everything gets one of three tags: `need` `want` `save`. That's it. The app uses a customisable version of the 50/30/20 rule — you log your recurring needs (rent, bills, subscriptions), and it calculates your split automatically. No sub-categories, no spending rules.

**There's \~10 minutes of setup** — adding your accounts, income, recurring bills and needs such as groceries and fuel. Anything in a month you know you need to spend money on. After that, day-to-day use is just logging what you spend.

You get a dashboard with your needs/wants/savings split, a daily spending budget (""£11.56 a day, 12 days left""), and savings goals you can track against your pot.

Free, works offline, data stays on your device. Optional cloud sync for multiple devices.

Would love feedback on the idea more so than the implementation — there are kinks to iron out for sure.

1r7apm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Marita-Driven/comments/1r7apm8/ghost_meridian_part_one/,"Ghost Meridian, Part One","The planet on the forward display looked like something had tried to kill it and nearly succeeded.

Capitaine de Vaisseau Élise Marchetti studied Mercury through the optical sensor feed — the real feed, not the synthesized enhancement the navigation systems preferred to show. Craters compounded on craters. Cliffs three kilometers high where the core had contracted and the crust had sheared. The Caloris Basin, twelve hundred kilometers across, dark as an old wound. The terminator ran a hard, absolute line down the surface because there was no atmosphere to scatter the light, no softening of shadows, no twilight. The planet didn’t do twilight. It did full sun and full dark, and the transition between them was a knife’s edge.

“Deceleration profile?” she said.

Lieutenant-Commandant Théo Papadakis looked up from the navigation console without lifting his coffee. He had the Greek spacer’s habit of holding the cup in both hands even when acceleration made it unnecessary. “Two-G, continuous, for another eleven hours. We close to fifty thousand kilometers at fourteen-thirty. I ran an efficiency calculation an hour ago, tightened the approach vector by point-four degrees. Saves us about forty kilograms of fuel on the back end.”

“Submit it.”

“Already executed.” He returned to his display. “Nineteen minutes ago.”

Marchetti acknowledged this with a slight nod and said nothing more. Papadakis ran the ship’s navigation the way a watchmaker ran his bench, with a precision that exceeded what she asked for by enough margin that she’d stopped asking him to justify the margin. He was twenty-eight years old and had spent more time in transit than planetside, and his instincts for fuel economy were the kind that got people home.

The task group was three ships: Vauban herself, forty-eight hull points of European Compact cruiser, plus the frigates Languedoc and Cassini each holding station twelve thousand kilometers to port and starboard. Their drives flared in the IR feed like blue-white candles — the thermal signature of twelve megagrams of mass decelerating against the arithmetic of the rocket equation. 

Anyone within sensor range knew they were here. Had known for two days.

That was acceptable. This was an inspection mission, not a raid. You didn’t approach Mercury on a cold-coast ballistic and then expect anyone to agree you had peaceful intentions when you arrived.

“Signal from Admiral Fontaine,” said Ensign Roux from the communications station.

“Time of transmission?”

“Seven minutes, nineteen seconds ago, sir.”

Seven minutes nineteen seconds. Mercury-Earth separation today: roughly 131 million kilometers. Fontaine’s words had traveled at the speed of light and had taken seven minutes and nineteen seconds to arrive. Any reply she sent would take another seven minutes and nineteen seconds to reach him. The round trip was fourteen minutes thirty-eight seconds, during which time the situation she was reporting would have evolved significantly, his orders would have been overtaken by events, and she would have had to make decisions that no headquarters could rationally second-guess because headquarters was sitting fourteen light-minutes away and dealing with yesterday’s weather.

“Read it.”

Roux cleared her throat. “Capitaine Marchetti. Intelligence confirmation from the Scorpion overflight indicates one CDSA mining installation at Caloris Basin coordinates 28.7°N, 162°E, and one warm vessel, frigate-class, designated Provisional Contact Bravo-Two, bearing 055 at approximately three hundred thousand kilometers from Mercury center. You are authorized to establish inspection of the installation per the Hellas Draft Accords framework. Rules of engagement: defensive fire only. Do not escalate. Fontaine.”

Marchetti absorbed this.

One warm vessel. The intelligence said one warm vessel.

She looked at the sensor repeater. The frigate — Jilong, according to the CDSA registry, an older class — sat three hundred twelve thousand kilometers from Mercury’s center on a stable prograde orbit. Warm. Visible. Its drive had been active for three days, powering the mining equipment on the surface below. It was generating enough heat to be detectable from the Martian relay stations.

One warm vessel was what the intelligence said.

She didn’t like how much that statement depended on the word warm.

“Papadakis.”

“Sir.”

“I want a full passive sensor sweep, maximum integration time. Everything within one million kilometers of Mercury. Visual, IR, radar-off. Give me a picture.”

“Integration time at maximum passive will take about twenty minutes for a proper baseline.”

“Take twenty minutes.”

He started the sweep without another word.

In the back of Marchetti’s mind, a number sat unattended: Mercury’s equatorial orbital velocity was 47.4 kilometers per second relative to the Sun. A vessel on a prograde Mercury orbit, with its drive off, would be essentially invisible in the IR. It would appear as a cold object moving in lockstep with the planet’s shadow — indistinguishable from an irregular shaped rock unless your radar happened to hit it at the right angle, and only if you were looking in the right direction, which nobody would be looking if one of its companions was making plenty of visible noise three hundred thousand kilometers away.

Marchetti was not comfortable. She was professional enough to know that discomfort was data.

She pulled up the fuel log. The efficiency burn had adjusted their approach vector nineteen minutes ago. She cross-referenced with the deceleration profile. The change was small — point-four degrees — but over the remaining eleven hours of deceleration it would shift their final approach corridor by a meaningful margin. Standard procedure. Routine fuel management.

She closed the log and went back to watching Mercury grow.",1,1771345582.0,u_Marita-Driven,0,1.0,False

We’ve been actively trying since 2022. Husband has been tested and everything looks great on his end.

On my end, my AMH dropped from 1.9 to 1.5 in the span of 5 months. The last time I was checked was April 2025 so I’m not sure what it’s at currently. My whole family is diabetic and has had heart attacks/strokes. I also have elevated LpA which means I’m more likely to have a heart disease no matter my diet or exercise. However, I have lost 25 pounds, and am eating better regardless of having horrible carb cravings and horrible eating habits my whole life. I don’t drink, don’t smoke, cut out sodas and mostly eat at home other than a social brunch or coffee.

I have experienced painful periods for the past 15 years. There’s been times where I ended up in the ER because the pain was so bad I would throw up pain meds and anti nausea meds. My pain lasts only a few hours the first day of my period. My mother was diagnosed with endometriosis through a lap and had me shortly after (naturally). I am considering asking for a laparoscopy but I have never been put under before and would like more information on it. 

My HSG was fine (one tube was clear, the other took time to unblock). Failed IUI’s, medicated cycles (letrozole), trigger shots starting Jan 2025 and ended in Oct 2025. Normal lining during that time was 6-7.5mm and I’d have 1-4 large follicles. Currently testing with MIRA (photos on my page of my cycle). Luteal phase is around 14 days and entire cycle is maybe around 33 days.

Clinic’s suggestion is IVF and doesn’t seem that interested in a laparoscopy for me. What’s your suggestion? I assumed a lap would be our first option to create a good environment for us to try and conceive naturally BUT now I’m hearing a lap could possibly lower my AMH more if my ovaries are affected.

A little back story.. 
Im 20 years old, came to Dubai from India on a tourist/visit visa, I came here in hopes of getting or finding a job. 

I was promised by someone i had spoken to ON FACEBOOK for a painters job, not my field ofcourse but I just needed to leave India as i was raised in Oman and dont know anything about India, my family isuin Oman but i have lost contact with them as they didnt wanttme to work, but while i was 16 I got a job and wanted to work and slowly started an artificial jewelry business that was doing great, due to my family's anger they cancelled my visa and told me to ""do everything on my own"" So I was deported to a country that I had never visited before ""india"" As my father is from India, mother fromiindonesia, I had savings of about 10,000 AED which i used to apply for a freelance 2 year visa to Dubai since I should be over 21+ if i wanted my own visa in Oman, I spent over 6500 AED for a freelance visa which later found out that i had been scammed and the person who took the money blocked me. 

He sent me a fake visa and with that i had already booked my ticket and was in the airport, too late to turn back whilst in the airport itself I applied for a 1 monthDubaiV urgent visa and postponed my flight to a day later as i was promised visa in 24 hour, i started researching all over facebook since Facebook groups is how i used to get jobs in oman, i connected with someone who promised me a painters job and he was Providing accommodation plus food, i agreed though salary was 900 AED and 12 hour work, but he said if i can learn the work fast he'd even give me the 2 year visa. 

After staying in the airport for 24 hours as before i was staying in a lodge or bedspace in mumbai which i had already checked out of I finally  got my visit visa approved, i flew the same day and landed in Abu Dhabi airport, from where i took a shuttle bus of etihad airways to Dubai, a whole new place for me, whole new experience and i had only 1250 AED to sustain myself for the month. 

I directly spoke with the painter job guy on whatsapp and he sent me a location to go to, apparently accomodation was there and he said work will start in 2 days, I went there and saw 16 PEOPLE in one room, it shocked me, people were smoking in the room, drinking in the room and what not, i was traumatized, but i have to stay becauss i dont have alot of money, i dont know about bedspace system or partition system, nothing. 

I stayed there for 3 days and during that time j used to go out in the morning and wander in the malls try to give out my CV here and there and come back in the evening to night to sleep because of the amount of people and cigarettes and all i couldnt bear it. 

The 4th day i was woken up by someone in the room and was forced to rush to a car with a few more guys and go for work, upon reaching the work i realized its not the same ""painting job"" I signed up for we were at the world trade center and we needed to pick up heavy bricks and basically clean up the event, i texted the guy who brought me to that room and me told me that its not his work but someone elses who is probably staying in my room and i should probably get paid 60-80 AED the same night. 

But after the work they told me that yes its not his work its their own like a daily basis job (diyadi) or something and that they would pay me, but they didnt pay, 2 days more of no painting job and the guy also stopped replying to me, again they made me go to another job, i refused as i wanted payment but they said if you dont go then pack your things and leave, i had no place to go to, thats why i stayed and went for the work, again as usual they didnt pay me, that night i was researching about mobile phones on dubizzle and figured i have 1000 AED something i should just buy and sell phones, i spoke with a seller and negotiated a good phone, to pick up the next day, I had gone to sleep and the next day i wake up and i couldnt find my wallet, i searched everywhere and finally found it near the toiler with NO MONEY. ALL STOLEN. I was so heartbroken i didnt know what to do as the room had 16 people and no camera, i tried to ask everyone but no one knew anything. 

Then the same evening the electricity went out and we all were forced to sit in a car for a job, but still no payment, we were brought to abu dhabi where we were forced to work for  23 hours straight picking up heavy wooden furniture and assisting in assembling them. 

After that when we came back there was nk electriciry still and the person in charge who was bringing us to jobs told us he will do somethinh about the electriciry but did nothing and we had to sleep without ac or anything. 

Then all of a sudden after getting just 3 hours of sleep at around 6-7 am in the morning we were forced to evacuate the room becauss they apparently hadnt paid rent. 

The one who was incharge had a cousin who always wanted to talk to me, this guy told me he knows another place where we will get job and theyll pay in evening, we went their this was in hor al anz, we worked for a week, but no payment, i was forced to work becauss if i didnt then i wouldnt be able to have an accomodation, after a week one night while i was trying to sleep this ""cousin"" Who brought me there started touching me inappropriately, as we had to sleep on on bed both of us because there was no space for 2, at night he started trying to touch me and rubbing his ehm against me. I stayed quiet and just stood up and went to toilet, after that i never slept at night only 1-2 hours while we're at some site for work. 

Apparently this cousin has an elder brother whos an alcoholic and plays betting every night, this brothee of his was eating our money, because he was older thus cousin allowed it also, i found this out from the management of that bedspace or labour accomodation who gives us work. 

Now i explain clearly to this cousin that im not here for games i have about 5-10 days until my visa expires i need to go back or get a visa, he promised me he'd either pay to extend my visa or he would find a job for me as he has got contacts. But a day or 2 later cousin has a fight with his brother and his brother slaps ME???? and tells both of us to leave, i kept quiet as i dont want any scene and left, he came with me as well, now im homeless and broke, but this cousin says no issues hes got someone who will give us a place, we go there and again only 1 bed, this was in bur dubai, no work just accomodation, he feeds me lies big dreams that he'll get me a job in hotel management and i can work in burj al arab with good salary etc because i know english, but then again he tried to ehm yk 'touch' me, thats when i had haf enough and asked him not to as im not like that and i need a job i had about 5 days pending, he promised me that theres a job with good pay per day lets go there from tomorrow, we went at 12am at NIGHT to the job and i find out that its 'selling alcohol' illegally, there was this whole operation for that, and i refused, im a muslim, i would never, he was a muslim as well but then...idk, anyways, he forced me and pushed me, he wasnt taking no for an answer, so finally i told him ill only do like standing far, he told me to take a cycle and use it to transport the bottles, i agreed but as soon as i got that cycle i cycled back to the accomodation, took my things and ditched the cycle there and ran back to hor al anz, spoke with the same guy who gave us work earlier and told him to ONLY pay me becauss i neeeded to make the money for my ticket. 

I work there for about a week, but the issue is is that the money i was getting 60 AED and 10 minus for the bedspace means 50 AED PER DAY, which i eventually went into overstay, then this cousin guy returned and he tried to get close to me again which i refused and set a boundary after that a new guy came for the same work but this guy knew english, ill name him A so A seemed like a good educated guy, family was in Dubai just going through a small downfall, i became friends with A my first actual friend in dubai, or.... I thought, until thus happened. 

One day A told me i had cash and wanted to check my wallet (as a friend) to go and eat out which I denied that i had cash as i save each and every penny for my visa, tho overstay seemed crazy to clear but not impossible, i had around 4-500 aed in savings, and it was in my bag with my passport and all, so he checked and found nothing, then he asked me to check his wallet which i refused but he insisted and there he had 1500 AED so i told him if he wanted to eat out then why not spend from his pocket since... He hasaalot, right? But he said hes only in dubai becauss he is here for giving driving lessons while earning a few bucks he actually stays in Sharjah, i was like okay, thats fine, fast forward a week or 5 days later i had a job interview in JBR, i didnt know how to get there but i have google maps right? So I go, this was 2nd december UAEs national day and i went there in the morning, after the interview i sort of just stayed because i read in the news that there were fireworks and i just wanted to be at some peace. 

Apparently after waiting for 8 hours or so the fireworks was cancelled, and everyone there was ledt in disappointment, i take the metro back at around 9-10 pm and accidentally fall asleep, waking up and last stop centerpoint and I realize its 1 am and no metro back, i didnt know how to get a taxi and saw that my phone js also dead, so i decided to follow the sign boards by walk on the main road that led to hor al anz, i was near the airport crossing the road when a police from the other side of the airport fence called me, i came to the fence and he asked me questions, why am i here at this time? Its illegal to cross the road that way, what am i doing so late at night like this? Where is my passport? Where js my visa? I explain that my passport is in my bag in my room and my visa is on my phone but its dead, i am on overtsay but im resolving my issues, during the time amnesty was going on but i wasnt eligible for amnesty as i came on october, so he called another police guy and they put me in the car and brought me to the police station in the airporr, got my phone charged and checked my passport and visa, then they let me go, they strictly told me to keep my passport with me at all times, so as soon as i reached my room i opened my bag only to find out that the lock is broken and my smaller bag is gone, which contained all my documents, passport and cash, i asked everyone in the morning but no one knew anything. 

No one admitted no one said anything, just we dont know, the guy A was getting close to the Cousin guy so we kind of drifted apart too so i didnt talk to him as much, i asked him as well byt he replied with dont accuse me. 

2 days later he claims that his 1500 AED is stolen, he checks with everyone but somehow he kept on telling me if i have it just give it back but i didnt have it, I didnt know myself who took it as i was at work for morning shift then night shift and both in sharjah and only after coming back he told me that his money was lost, a day or 2 passed and he had come on my bed to comb his hair as i only have a mirror, so as a joke i pushed him to the side to push him i pushed him from his waist which i felt passport type book feeling, i tried to check but he wouldnt budge, he kept saying its important document of his etc. I kept insisting but he just walked out quickly and i didnt know where he went and when he came back, that wasnt with him, the next morning i went to muraqqabat police station to file a complaint on him becauss i was sure he took it, maybe he suspected me, maybe it was cousin who told him to do so, so at the police station the police calls him and he lies to the police saying i took 5000 aed from him, to which the police told me to settle the matter with him. 

I was lost and made the decision to leave that accommodation, for the next 3 months or so i was homeless in the streets of deira, i was always around baniyas square, al rigga and union side, wandering around asking people for job, i didn't get a job, during the time i gave my luggage to a shopping center as ""baggage deposit"" Becauss i cant bring it with me everywhere and they refused to give it baack after 3 days and demanded 50 AED which i couldnt give, i slept on the streets in just one pair of clothes for about 3 months, i used to shower in the mosques and blew my entire visa savings on transport for interviews and food. 

After 3 months through Facebook after i shared my story someone said theyll help me figure out my visa, my passport and accommodation, and job, i was the happiest and thought that im the luckiest person alive. during the 3 months i tried to apply for a lost passport certificate again and again but it kept getting rejected due to ""techincal errors"" Or my passport detials wasnt found with immigration or something i tried through muraqqabat police station as well as online as well as qusais police. Nothing worked. Anyways that person comes and meets me, he spoke big things as if he was going to take over dubai, fed me with these big things, then told me that he has a canteen in sharjah al dhaid, told me to work there and he will do the visa and passport and he sells visas as well, at first when i got there there was no ac nothing, i worked and slept there jtself under the scorching sun but I wanted my visa and passport to be sorted so i struggled i had to make the sacrifice and its not like i wasnt homeless before. About 3- 4 months i worked there until the canteen was ready and AC was put and all but no sign of any earnings for me and no visa and no passport, i didnt care about the money i just wanted the passport and visa, but nothing? I spent 7 months or so in the same pair of clothes, and i couldn't do anything about it, after that through facebooo i again i was hired for a part time gig as a model for peets coffee in arabian ranches and theyd pay me 500 AED, i told this guy, let me name him N the guy who promised me visa and all, I told him about this and he said he'd drop me, this canteen was in a stadium 63 km from al nahda dubai, so i couldn't go myself of course now he comes and bring me to Dubai, where i had gone for the shoot, after the shoot i was to be paid 500 aed but through bank transfer and i didnt know anyone except this guy N so i requested him that if i receive the 500 through his bank can hw give me cash? He agreed to it, so i forwarded his bank details, for a month no cash was received and i didnt want to disturb him i didnt want him to think im doubting that he spent it or anything so i didnt ask, after a month i ask the sender and she says that she sent 2-3 days ago, i forward that message to him, and he was like ""oh that was yours? I thought it was from one of my client so i spent it, i dont have it now ill pay you when i get"" I was like just look after my passport and visa,its okay. 

Now after a few days the owner of that stadium comes to me and tells me that this guy N has been arrested due to ""fraud"" And im shook, no passport? No visa? And now hws arrested? And the owner kicks me out of there and tells me to take my things and leave as he's hiring someone else. I was so heartbroken but i had nothing to say. 

Next morning i was out and i again was homeless and broke in deira again as deira js the only place i knew, i spent my days just wandering here and there and trying to get a job, i became on absconding even, and was totally lost. 

Fast forward to 3-4 months ago, now I posted about my story again and someone offered me a bedspace, i stayed there for a month and during that time i saw a post where someone needed a model for content creation and i have been creating content in the past so i signed myself up for it and got it, it was a part time gig and they paid a little well, i was able to shift to al nahda sharjah as rent is cheaper here in bedspace and i even started mess food system with someone now i got 1-2 nore shoots after that and then yet again dry, people want to hire me but they want me to record myself and i didnt have an iphone anymore as i had to sell it while i was homeless, I had just a cheap android that camera doesnt work, i posted about this again on reddit seeing if maybe someone would help me out for any iphone so i can start getting gigs again, as many were waiting, someone finallu stepped forward and did they paid my pending rent of December and gave me an iphone 11, i started connecting with businesses again but yet again this wasnt going to sustain me, plus the new media license thing? Everyone asks about that, so i decide to look for jobs in contenr creation. Thats when finally i landed my first interview with a company, they liked me and my confidence and promised a job of content creator cum social media management in AD and that theyll test or train me for 3-4 days then theyll issue me the offer letter in which affer that theyll clear my fines and absconding as well.

This is like answered prayers and with a good company, plus they'll cut from my salary a percentage until they make all of their money back that they invested into me. 

Now the issue is:

1) I don't have money to go from al nahda to AD

2) i need to pay my pending rent. 

3) I need to pay for the mess pending payment as well. 

4) i was able to collect few things and clothes which i now need a suit case if im to take with me, which i dont have as well. 

What do i do? How do i resolve all of this? 

Im just lost and dont know what is to be done as this is my one and only chance of getting my visa status sorted and finally FINALLY having a job. 

P.s i received a call during my homeless time from the police and was told to come to muraqqabat police station to collect my passport so i have my passport but becauss of i was unable to pay for my bedspacr rent and mess i didnt want to lose it i gave my passport as collateral that ill collect it when i pay... And now i really need it and im just so lost... I need advice or like any charity place or somethinh idkkk im just so lost.. ",1,1771345397.0,Sharjah,0,1.0,False

1r7akh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r7akh7/great_first_dates_always_make_me_spiral_after/,Great first dates always make me spiral after,"I had a genuinely good first date this weekend and now my brain is doing that thing where it turns a sweet memory into a full investigation. We met for coffee, then it turned into a long walk because the weather was weirdly nice, and we ended up talking for like two hours. Normal stuff: school, family, bad jobs, random internet drama, even which snacks are secretly elite. He was consistent, actually listened, asked follow up questions, didn’t make it sexual, didn’t try to “win” the convo. At the end we did the awkward goodbye hug, laughed at ourselves, and then he leaned in for a quick kiss. It felt easy and kind of safe. I went home smiling like an idiot, which is rare for me after first dates.

Then the next day I woke up and started replaying every second like I’m grading my own performance. Did I talk too much. Did I overshare. Was the kiss weird. Did I look nervous. Was he just being polite and I’m projecting chemistry onto someone who’s just nice. I hate that I can’t just enjoy something without immediately trying to prove it’s not real. And because I know I do this, I start monitoring my thoughts like, ok girl, stop it, and somehow that makes it worse. He texted me later that night saying he had fun and asked if I want to do something again this week. I said yes, because I do. But now I’m scared I’m going to show up to date two acting guarded, or I’ll blurt out some heavy question too early because I want certainty. Like part of me wants to ask, “are you actually into me or are you just filling time” which is such a mood killer and also not fair to put on someone after one date.

So how do you tell the difference between intuition and anxiety at the beginning, especially as a girl who’s trying to date without turning it into a whole therapy session. And what do you actually do with that anxious energy so you don’t sabotage a good start  .

You don’t just “run into” new circles as easily, so you have to create opportunities.

Start by increasing your visibility. Say yes to invitations, attend local events, join classes, and participate in activities consistently rather than once. Repetition builds familiarity, and familiarity builds comfort. Whether it’s a fitness class, a wine tasting, or a travel group found on Meetup, the key is showing up regularly so conversations can develop naturally.

Next, initiate small conversations. Ask simple, open questions about the activity you’re both attending. Keep it light and curious rather than outcome-focused. If the conversation flows, suggest continuing it over coffee. Most connections begin with one person taking a small social risk.

If you prefer online dating, create a clear and recent profile on platforms designed for your age group, such as OurTime or SilverSingles. Use current photos, state clearly whether you’re interested in companionship, casual dating, or a committed relationship, and move to a brief phone call before meeting in person. Be proactive instead of waiting to be contacted.

For short-term relationships, focus on shared activities and chemistry, and be upfront about not seeking long-term commitment. For long-term relationships, take more time. Ask about lifestyle preferences, health outlook, family involvement, and financial expectations early enough to avoid surprises later.",1,1771345185.0,WeSuckAtDating,0,1.0,False

We should probably start with the fact that my name is Anna, I am 18 years old, and it will be a story that lasts almost 5 years about how I felt romantic feelings for my friend (she is a girl too). Her name is Lexi. 

So, 5 years ago we met in a dating bot, I was 14, she was 15, we lived next to each other, but we couldn't meet because we had quite strict parents, so we just talked on the Internet, it was correspondence where we discussed common interests, but nothing special. At that time, another girl came to me, I told Lexi about it, and she was supportive, despite our rather homophobic country. After a while, problems began in our country, maybe you can guess where I'm from ahahah, so we started talking more in the style of ""how are you? Is everything okay?» And so time passed, we never met in life, and she wrote that she would go to another country, I was sad that we would probably never meet again, so our communication began to disappear a little, but after a while my family and I also went to another country (it is far from the one where Lexi was). We sometimes talked, but not much, more in waves, then we communicate constantly, then we are silent for months. 

But then, in the spring of 2023, we started talking much more, found the topic in common interests again, and then it turned out that we were returning home at the same time, I was very happy because we would finally be able to meet. I arrived a few days earlier, I was really looking forward to her, and then, when she was also at home, I started calling her for a walk, at first she refused all the time, but I realized that she was just worried, so I continued to insist, and she agreed. 

Our first meeting was so special, Lexi was so beautiful, so sweet and kind, and we seemed to immediately find a common language, the very moment I saw her I felt like my heart was pierced by Cupid's arrow. We walked almost every day, I realized that I began to like her during the correspondence, but in life it was even brighter, she was so caring, sweet to me, a little shy, but over time she got used to my touch on her hand or hugs, so I constantly began to hold hands when walking. It was a great time. But sometimes I was so sad that I can't kiss her, or hug her not as a friend. 

She went on a summer trip with her parents, and when she came back, she was like a different person, like closed, detached, I asked her a lot about it, but she said that everything was fine. At that moment, I had a theory that she also had feelings for me, but her family pressured her a little about the fact that she had to find herself a boyfriend, so after a long time with them she felt internal homophobia or something. So then our friendship changed a little, but we still went out a lot, and then I went to college, made new friends, and Lexi and I continued to hang out, but less than usual. At that moment, I realized that she was unlikely to ever feel the same for me as I do for her, but even if she likes me romantically, her internal homophobia is too strong. 

At that time I met my best friend, we won't give him a name, so just the best friend, but we were like soulmates, like we were born to meet, I told him a lot about Lexi, he supported me, he was also in a relationship at that moment, but over time we kind of felt something more, and I started to think that my feelings for Lexi had disappeared. We didn't succeed with my best friend, because we realized that we love each other only as friends, with platonic love.

But it didn't change anything, and a few months later he helped me a lot when my grandmother died (it was very difficult for me, she was the best person in my family), so I realized that I wanted to be with him very often and very often, so it was, he became the world for me at that time. Lexi distanced herself, in fact it was very natural, and I didn't miss her much, at that time I had financial problems, she said that during our walks she could pay for everything until it got better, but I was so ashamed that I couldn't even buy myself a cup of coffee, so I stopped seeing her at all. 

Here comes a rather confusing part of my life, I don't remember exactly how everything happened, but I felt a very strong pressure from the people around me, from studying, and Lexi kept inviting me to hang out, it was so annoying, I often refused her.

Well, a lot of time passed, it's already winter 2024, we're still like friends, but not close. I was glad that she got into university and found new people, because I no longer felt guilty for leaving her alone. So, on December 31st, my family is preparing New Year's dishes, and Lexi texts me, ""You're the first person I'm telling, but I have a boyfriend.""

I was so angry and disappointed, like, girl, I tried so hard to get your attention, your best friend saw that there were feelings between us, EVERYONE saw it I think, but you couldn't say anything to me, and then, fuck, some guy appeared, it was enough for him to just be nice to you for a little while, give you flowers, and now you're dating. I replied to her quite aggressively. She wrote to me that she hopes we can reconnect in the new year, that she wants everything to be like before, but I was so hurt that I didn't respond to that. She invited me to hang out, but I kept refusing, and one day she asked me to explain my behavior and I told her quite rudely that we wouldn't be communicating (at that time I was so tired of her, plus I thought that rejecting the past would help me feel better, because it was such a shitty period of my life).

I felt so good for a few weeks, like she and all my problems were gone. And then I felt even worse, because my best friend (with him we had also started communicating less, but I thought everything was okay between us, we were just busy with our own stuff) turned out to be TRASH. He and I had a huge fight, and it hit me incredibly hard. I won't go into that topic, because it's a topic for the next post, but I felt so bad that I started therapy with a psychologist. A few months passed, I was getting better, things with my friend weren't so bad either, but I felt an emptiness inside. We're talking about spring 2025, and spring is a time I associate with Lexi, because that's when we first met. At that moment, I realized how much I truly missed her. So, after discussing it with my psychologist, I wrote to her, apologized, told her about the therapy, about how it wasn't her fault that I left her. She forgave me.

Then we started seeing each other, it wasn't often, but it was cool, I thought ""she's really a great friend, I want to be friends with her."" I started inviting her to various workshops and interesting events, after one of them she told me ""I'm here for you, call me, text me, I see that something is bothering you"" and when I got home I called her crying into the phone, telling her how sorry I was that I was a bad friend, that I left her, and other things. She said she wasn't angry and I felt that she truly forgave me.

She went on Christmas vacation with her family and boyfriend to another country, we texted each other, and it turned out we got sick at the same time, so I asked how she was feeling and stuff, it was sweet and like before.

And now it's 2026, she's back home, and says ""let's meet on Saturday"" I agreed, and then I realized it's Valentine's Day, so I asked if she was sure, and she said yes. I gave her a scarf and a Valentine's card. During the meeting, she complained about her boyfriend, that she was tired of him, and many other things, and I felt that damn, I still feel something, that maybe I never stopped having romantic feelings for her, and now I just want to be closer friends and maybe try to give her some signs of attention, but she still has a boyfriend.

Earlier in life I had strong crushes, but when I moved abroad as an exchange student they started becoming much more intense.

Since then, my infatuations tend to last on average two years and can be genuinely painful. One rejection caused so much shame and anxiety that I once thought I saw him on campus and my whole body started shaking. I had to stop walking and was struggling to breathe well. Another example is when a different crush, my CrossFit coach, got a girlfriend, I cried for many days and avoided his classes.

Recently I hired a personal trainer after developing an illness that caused me to lose a lot of muscle and strength. He is extremely kind to me, which is a big weakness of mine because people are not often that nice to me. I would not call what I feel right now full limerence yet, but I can feel it starting.

The last time I saw him, he came over while I was working out alone and offered to bring me coffee from the cafe next door. It was unexpectedly sweet and made me so incredibly happy that I just couldn't stop smiling.

I really do not want to experience limerence again. And it sucks being obsessed with someone who will almost certainly never like me back. I am also almost 33 and have never had a boyfriend, so I know for a fact that even if he wasn't my trainer, he still wouldn't like me back.

a mindset coach, pushing morning routines and 60-second TikTok mantras. But the truth is,
most of that advice is recycled aesthetics with zero scientific backing. Real happiness is messy.
It's not just cold plunges and gratitude journals. Thankfully, the *actual* longest-running study on
happiness has answers, not aesthetics.
Dr. Robert Waldinger leads the Harvard Study of Adult Development, an 85-year (and counting)
longitudinal study that tracked the lives of 724 men and now includes their descendants—over
2000 people. His appearance on the *Diary of a CEO* podcast (Episode 246) breaks the
internet clichés and offers 10 data-backed lessons that are too real to ignore. This isn't just ""be
grateful"" fluff. This is science-backed life advice.
Here’s what stood out:


- **Good relationships > everything else**
The #1 predictor of long-term happiness and health? Quality of close relationships. Not wealth,
not fame, not even exercise. Just *real* human connection. Waldinger’s findings echo what the
Grant Study showed—loneliness kills. Deep ties protect both the body and the brain.


- **Social fitness matters as much as physical fitness**
You don’t “get” a successful relationship once and keep it forever. You have to work on it. Just
like lifting weights, social strength takes reps. The 2023 *American Perspectives Survey* found
that nearly 1 in 5 Americans report having no close friends. That’s a public health issue, not just
a social one.


- **Career success means nothing without personal connection**
People who chased prestige over purpose often ended up lonely and regretful. Waldinger
mentioned that many high-achievers in the study didn’t regret failing at work, they regretted not
spending time with their loved ones. This aligns with *Bronnie Ware's* iconic palliative care
findings—""I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends"" is a top 5 deathbed regret.


- **Conflict isn’t the issue—emotional avoidance is**
Couples who argued regularly but stayed emotionally engaged lived longer, happier lives than
those who bottled up tension. Suppression breeds resentment, not peace.


- **Being known beats being liked**
The study found that people who *felt known* (as in, understood deeply by someone) were
happier than those who were merely admired. The real flex isn’t popularity, it’s intimacy.


- **Happiness in your 80s depends more on your 50s relationships than cholesterol**
This wild finding stunned many. Predictors of aging well weren’t medical markers. It was stuff
like ""How satisfied are you in your relationships at age 50?"" Later confirmed in a 2023 health
meta-analysis published in *Psychological Science*.


- **Small moments > big milestones**
Most joyful memories in the study came from ordinary moments: morning coffee, a walk with a
friend, small talk that turned deep. Investing in small, consistent social rituals led to greater
well-being.


- **Vulnerability is strength**
The men who opened up emotionally—whether through journaling, therapy, or
friendships—fared better in mental health and cognitive function. Emotional expression is not a
luxury, it’s hygiene.


- **Loneliness affects your brain**
According to a 2021 *Nature Neuroscience* study, isolation literally rewires the brain and
increases susceptibility to depression and cognitive decline. It's not “in your head”—it's
*changing* your head.


- **Happiness is a practice, not a goal**
Waldinger emphasizes that happiness isn’t something you check off once you reach it. It’s
made in how you live, what you give your attention to, and who you keep around every single
day.

When you are building complex systems, ""brain fog"" is the ultimate enemy.

While most of the tech world survives on endless cups of coffee, a more sustainable secret is emerging from the **Altai Mountains**. It’s not just about physical strength anymore; it’s about **cognitive longevity**.

[Sustaining \\""Deep Work\\"" in the Age of Digital Fatigue.Caption: Complex problem-solving requires more than just caffeine; it requires cellular energy. I’ve found that adding Altai Shilajit to my workflow helps clear the brain fog during long design and coding sessions. It’s about cognitive endurance, not just a quick hit.Hashtags: #Biohacking #DeepWork #AltaiShilajit #Nootropics #Focus](https://preview.redd.it/uh4rokvuw2kg1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fa99cab9b8181b5a1d3a978453b536034af4f08)

# The ""Nootropic"" Edge of Altai Origin

Why are high-performers in tech switching to **Altai Shilajit**? It comes down to how it fuels the brain differently than caffeine:

* **ATP & Mitochondrial Support**: Thinking requires massive amounts of energy. Shilajit helps your mitochondria produce ATP more efficiently, keeping your brain ""powered up"" during long coding sessions or complex design phases.
* **Focus Without the Jitters**: Unlike the 3rd espresso that makes your hands shake, Altai Shilajit provides a calm, grounded sense of focus. It stabilizes your energy, allowing for deep-work states.
* **Mineral Depletion**: High stress and long hours in front of screens deplete your body's mineral stores. Altai Shilajit replenishes over 80 ionic minerals, helping to prevent the mental burnout often seen in the tech industry.

# Why the Altai Source Matters for Professionals

For a community that values precision (like the users of Dassault Systèmes), purity is non-negotiable.

* **Pristine Origin**: The Altai region is far less commercialized than the Himalayas, offering a cleaner, more potent resin.
* **Bioavailability**: The high fulvic acid content in our **Altai Origin** shilajit ensures that these nutrients actually cross the blood-brain barrier to do their work.

# The ""Engineer’s Protocol""

If you’re facing a day of complex problem-solving:

1. **Morning**: Dissolve a small amount of Altai Shilajit in your first drink.
2. **The Result**: A steady, reliable cognitive flow that lasts until the final line of code is written—no crash, just clarity.

I’m really enjoying the Instagram-location-videos, however, it seems like I’m getting a lot of businesses. There are no guideline PDF’s posted for this specific task. There are, however, guidelines for the Instagram-Location (Pictures). The guidelines for this task say “Indoor photos are accepted only if there are elements that clearly indicate the building’s location.” Two of my locations so far were a shopping mall, and a coffee shop… All the videos were inside the shopping mall, and inside the coffee shop.  
I did these tasks by selecting pictures that are, in my opinion, selecting things that are unique / an indicator of that specific business. Should I have skipped these instead? The video tutorial, the narrator mentions inside shots are ok.. but he doesn’t really show a good example of any. 

  
A lot of the videos I'm selecting also require some background research. For example, there is a video of people recording in a field. At the top right of the frame, you can see a light post, and a building.  
  
 I can see a reviewer flagging this, because it's a generic video and doesn't ""contribute"" much of anything. However, that building and light post, I can pinpoint exactly where on google satelittle images it is. It's in the required location, and would help build a over all landscape/view of the area. Am I overthinking this? Or just look for ""landmarks"" and stick to that?

I whipped my head around.

Nothing but the wall and the coat rack.

I looked at Rico. He wasn't watching the movie. He was staring at the window, his face illuminated by a jagged streak of lightning.

""Ant,"" he whispered. ""I swear I just saw a light in the House. Like a candle moving past the upstairs window.""

By 11:30 PM, the storm was a full-blown war zone outside.

The lights began to flicker, the filament in the bulbs whining as the power struggled. Then, the phone rang again.

Rochelle picked it up. ""Hello? Ma?"" Silence. She hung up. It rang again instantly. ""Hello? This isn't funny!"" Silence.

The third time, Rico snatched it. ""Whoever this is, we're calling the—""

He stopped. His face went a sickly shade of grey. He held the receiver out so we could all hear.

At first, it was just static. Then, a wet, bubbling gurgle, like someone trying to breathe through a throat full of blood.

Then, a scream—sharp, distorted, and so loud it sounded like it was being ripped out of the person's lungs—erupted from the earpiece.

Rico slammed the phone back onto the base, his hands shaking.

The basement pipes began to rattle, a frantic clink-clink-clink that sounded like teeth chattering.

""Something's on the roof,"" Tasha gasped.

She was right. Above the sound of the rain, we heard it:

Thump. Drag. Thump. Heavy, deliberate footsteps pacing the length of the house directly above our heads.

Suddenly, the backyard exploded into noise. We heard the chain-link fence rattling violently, the gate being slammed against the post over and over.

Trash cans were being hurled against the siding of the house. We huddled together and moved toward the back window, peering out into the storm.

A flash of lightning lit up the field. There, in the House across the field, we saw it.

A figure was pacing behind the glass of the main window. It stopped mid-stride.

It turned its head—that long, horrific snout—and looked directly at us. It didn't move.

It just stared, a black silhouette against the white flash of the sky.

The lights flickered, and when the next bolt of lightning hit, the window was empty.

BANG! BANG! BANG!

The noise moved to the attic. It sounded like someone was taking a sledgehammer to the rafters.

Tyson grabbed the baseball bat, and he and I crept to the attic pull-down stairs.

We shoved the door open, the beam of the flashlight cutting through the dust.

Empty. Just old boxes and cobwebs.

By 2:00 AM, the house was under siege.

The banging moved to the front door, then the windows, then the walls.

It was unrelenting—a rhythmic, heavy pounding that felt like the house was being Tenderized.

Screams that didn't sound human—high-pitched squeals mixed with a woman's sobbing—poured in from the darkness outside.

We saw shadows passing the windows, tall and distorted, moving faster than any person could.

Exhaustion finally started to win. By 4:00 AM, the adrenaline had burned out, leaving us hollow.

We drifted into a fitful, terrifying sleep, huddled together on the living room floor. Every time I closed my eyes, I heard the snort of the Pig-Lady in the hallway, but when I woke, the hall was empty.

At 7:30 AM, the sun rose, grey and sickly. We were all awake, staring at each other in the dim light, too tired to even speak.

A soft sliding sound came from under the couch.

We all looked down.

Rochelle’s missing Trigonometry textbook slid out from the shadows of the sofa, as if pushed by an invisible hand.

It flipped open to the center page.

Across the diagrams and equations, someone had used a thick, black marker to scribble three words in jagged, frantic handwriting:

I SEE YOU

The scream that left Tasha's throat was the sound of someone who had finally broken.

Sunday morning didn't feel like a day of rest.

It felt like the morning after a funeral where the body hadn't quite stayed in the casket.

The air in the living room was thick, not just with the humidity from the departing storm,

but with the jagged edges of six people who had reached their breaking point.

""Look, the book is weird, okay? I get it,"" Rochelle said, her voice projecting a shaky authority as she stood in the center of the room.

""But we are spiraling. The storm was crazy, that movie was dark, and we’re all exhausted. Our minds are just… filling in the blanks.

We’re going to clean this house, we’re going to act like normal teenagers,

and we’re going to stop letting a pile of wood across the street ruin our weekend.""

""And the message?"" Tasha asked, pointing a trembling finger at the open textbook on the coffee table.

""I SEE YOU. You think the wind wrote that, Ro?""

Kim stepped up, crossing her arms over her chest. ""I bet it was one of the boys. Probably Tyson. He’s been acting extra 'scary' all night.

You wrote it last night to mess with us, didn't you?""

""I didn't touch that damn book, Kim!"" Tyson barked, his eyes bloodshot.

""I spent the night clutching a baseball bat. I wasn't exactly in the mood for arts and crafts.""

""Say I did do it,"" Rico added, stepping in. ""Which I didn't. How do you explain it sliding out from under the couch on its own just now?

You know many books that have legs? You know many books that hide for two days then decide to make an entrance?""

The silence that followed was heavy.

Logic was failing us.

We spent the next hour cleaning in a sort of frantic, desperate silence—scrubbing away the physical mess of the night to try

and scrub away the memory of it.

By 10:00 AM, the house was spotless, but we still felt filthy.

Rochelle finally broke the tension with a forced, playful roll of her eyes.

""Alright, enough. Every single one of you smells like ass and terror. We’re doing a shower rotation. Pick a number 1 through 10.""

We shouted out numbers.

Rochelle grinned. ""One. I’m first. The rest of you, get your bags ready.

Lowest number to highest. No more ghost talk. We’re getting fly, we’re getting fresh, and we’re resetting this vibe.""

The order was set: Rochelle, Tasha, Tyson, Rico, Kim, and finally, me.

As the shower started thundering down the hall, the mood lightened, if only because we were desperate for a diversion.

We started pulling our ""Sunday best"" out of our bags, bragging about who had the best fit.

Rochelle came out first, looking radiant in a flowy, floral sundress, her long hair damp and smelling like coconut.

Tasha followed, emerging a bit later in a high-fashion cropped sweater and pleated skirt, her curls tight and perfect.

When Tyson came out, he was rocking a t-shirt with a vintage Biggie Smalls print and baggy jeans, his fade sharp. Rico joined us next, looking unusually sophisticated in dark slacks and a crisp, white button-up, his ponytail sleekly tied back.

""Look at Rico trying to be a grown-up,"" Kim teased, leaning against the wall.

As Kim was about to enter the bathroom, she turned and gave me that sharp, dangerous smile.

""Ant, you know you want to take a shower with me. Stop playing.""

""Girl, you wish,"" Rico blurted out, making Tasha chuckle.

I leaned back, deciding to call her bluff. ""Alright then, Kim. Let's go. No shame in my game.""

Kim’s eyes widened for a split second before she turned shy, her hand fluttering to my arm.

""You know I’m just teasing… you couldn't handle all this anyway.""

When Kim finished her turn, she looked stunning—a beauty with her long hair cascading over a white tube top and a denim mini-skirt.

Kim did a little spin, headed my way and she gave a playful touch on my arm.

As she touched me, I glanced over her shoulder. Tasha was at the window again.

""I think I saw something,"" she whispered. ""Just now. In the attic window of that house. A face… or a mask.""

""Don't start, Tasha,"" Rico groaned. ""Ant, get in the shower. You’re the last one. Go.""

I headed into the bathroom. The room was like a sauna, thick with the floral and musky scents of five different body washes.

Steam hung in the air like a heavy curtain. I stripped down and stepped into the spray, letting the hot water wash away the grit of the last two days.

Creak.

I froze. The bathroom door had rattled.

""Rico?"" I called out. ""I'm in here, man!""

No answer. I felt a sudden, sharp spike of nerves.

The steam seemed to thicken, swirling around the shower curtain.

Then, without warning, the curtain was ripped back.

I jumped, nearly slipping on the wet porcelain.

Kim stood there, her eyes wide, staring at me with a grin that went from ear to ear.

She was blushing a deep rose color, stumbling back a step.

""Oh my... damn,"" she whispered, her gaze lingering. ""Ant, I… I didn't think you’d actually be…""

But her smile didn't just fade—it evaporated. Her face went bone-white. She wasn't looking at me anymore.

She was looking past me, at the steam-covered mirror behind the sink.

""No... no, that can't be right,"" she stammered.

I stepped out of the shower, grabbing a towel, and looked. Written in the thick fog on the glass,

as if a finger had traced the words while I was behind the curtain, was a single sentence:

YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE

""I didn't do that, Kim,"" I whispered, the hair on my arms standing up. ""I was in the water the whole time.""

""I just walked in!"" she cried. ""I didn't touch the glass!""

She bolted for the door, screaming for the others.

A minute later, all six of us were crammed into the small, humid bathroom.

We stood there—Rochelle in her floral dress, Tasha in her curls, Tyson in his Biggie shirt, Rico in his button-up, Kim in her tube top,

and me, standing there in my nice jeans and pinstriped shirt, damp and trembling.

""Why were you even in here, Kim?"" Tasha asked, her voice tight with suspicion.

""Sightseeing,"" Kim muttered, but the joke lacked any sting.

""Ooh, girl, you nasty,"" Rico and Rochelle said in unison, but their eyes were fixed on the mirror.

""I don't think we should have ever gone into that house,"" Tyson said quietly. His voice was hollow, the bravado of his rapper-tee completely gone.

""I know we shouldn't have,"" Tasha agreed.

It was barely 11:30 AM on Sunday morning.

We were all dressed up, looking our best, ready for a day that would never come.

The message on the mirror was still dripping, the word ""HIDE"" weeping down the glass like a tear.

By 1:00 PM, the ""Sunday reset"" was a total failure.

We were all dressed in our best clothes—crisp shirts, fresh denim, hair laid perfectly—but we looked like people dressed for their own viewings at a funeral home.

The house was too quiet, yet somehow too loud.

Every time the floorboards settled, it sounded like a footstep. Every time the wind brushed the siding, it sounded like a whisper.

""We can't just sit here,"" I said, pacing the living room. ""If we sit here, we’re just waiting for that mirror to write something else.

We need to know what we’re dealing with.""

""Know what?"" Rico asked, leaning against the wall, his shirt looking wrinkled already from his constant fidgeting.

""That the house is haunted? We know that, Ant. We lived it.""

""No,"" Rochelle said, her eyes sharp. ""Ant’s right. Grandma used to say there’s no such thing as a new ghost.

Everything has a beginning. We’re going to the library. We’re looking at the old city records.""

The walk was a nightmare in slow motion.

We passed through the park again, but the air felt like it was thickening, turning into a syrup that was hard to push through.

Every time we passed a parked car, I saw a reflection in the hubcaps—a tall, bent figure walking right in the middle of our group.

But when I looked at Rico or Tyson next to me, there was nothing but empty pavement.

At the gas station, the overhead fluorescent lights hummed with an aggressive, buzzing frequency that made my teeth ache.

The clerk didn't even look up; he just stared at a small black-and-white TV that was showing nothing but static.

By 3:00 PM, we were huddled in the basement of the local library, surrounded by the smell of vanilla and rot—old paper and damp stone.

""Look at this,"" Tasha whispered, her voice cracking.

She had a micro reader pulled up, scrolling through archives from decades ago.

We crowded around the glowing screen.

It was a vague crime report from the late '70s. Location: Faircrest Ave. The report was brief, almost dismissive.

It detailed a missing person call. The responding officers found the house empty.

No signs of a struggle. No blood.

The only thing they noted was that the homeowner’s pigs kept in a makeshift pen in the cellar—were ""unusually well-fed and aggressive.""

The case was closed after a week.

Reason: Homeowner departed of own accord.

""Well-fed,"" Tasha repeated, her curls casting long, jagged shadows across the screen.

""Just like my grandma said. They didn't find a body because there wasn't enough left of her to call a body.""

The shock hit us like a physical weight. Tasha's ghost story wasn't a story at all. It was a police record.

Rico pulled a stack of urban legend books and ""Real Ghost Sightings of the Great Lakes"" off the shelves.

""Maybe there's a way to make it stop,"" he muttered, flipping through pages of rituals and hauntings.

""Maybe we just have to acknowledge it.""

""I don't want to acknowledge it. I want to eat,"" Kim said, her voice brittle.

""I can't think on an empty stomach. Let's just... let's go to the diner. Please. I need to see people. Normal people.""

We checked out the books and began the trek to the local diner.

The feeling of being followed was no longer a suggestion; it was a certainty.

It felt like a cold hand was hovering an inch from the back of my neck. We walked faster,

our conversation turning into a frantic, overlapping mess of plans and fears.

""What are you getting, Ant?"" Tyson asked, trying to break the tension.

""I’m getting the biggest burger they got. If I’m gonna go out, I’m going out full.""

""Burger sounds good,"" I said, my eyes darting to every alleyway we passed. ""But you see that? Behind that fence?""

""Don't look, Ant,"" Rochelle hissed. ""Just keep walking.""

We reached the diner around 5:45 PM. The bell chimed, and the warmth of the grill hit us, but the unease didn't lift.

We sat in a large booth, spreading the library books out among the milkshakes and fries.

Every so often, Tasha would gasp, pointing at a drawing of a ""hush-hider"" or a ""skin-shifter,"" but nothing looked like the snout-faced woman we had seen.

The air in the diner felt tight, like the oxygen was being sucked out of the room.

I looked at the waitress—a young girl who looked exhausted—and for a second, her face blurred, her nose elongating into something wet and pink.

I blinked, and she was just a girl again, holding a check.

We left around 8:00 PM. The sun was gone, replaced by a sky the color of charcoal.

The walk back to Rico's house was the longest of my life.

The streetlights didn't just flicker; they pulsed like a dying heart.

The sounds of the city—the distant sirens, the barking dogs—all seemed to be screaming at once, then falling into a terrifying, sudden silence.

Shadows intensified, stretching across the road until they looked like reaching fingers.

As we turned the corner onto our block, we all stopped.

The House across the field was waiting. It looked darker than the night around it, a hole in reality.

And there, in the highest window—the attic—was a shadow.

It wasn't moving. It was standing perfectly still, its silhouette unmistakable.

It was staring directly at us, watching six kids return to the trap.

""She's waiting,"" Tasha whispered.

And then, the shadow leaned forward, its head tilting at a sickening, unnatural angle, as if it were listening to our hearts beat from across the field.

The front door hadn't even been locked for five seconds when the first crack of thunder split the sky.

It wasn't just a storm; it was a physical weight dropping onto our block.

""Seriously?"" Tyson's voice was a ragged edge of disbelief. ""Again? It’s like the sky is trying to drown us so we can't leave.""

The atmosphere in the house was suffocating.

I leaned against the wall, my head spinning with the police reports and the image of that shadow in the attic window.

On the couch, the girls were huddled together. I saw Kim whisper something to Rochelle and Tasha, her eyes darting to me.

She made a wide gesture with her hands.

Despite the terror, they let out small, hysterical giggles.

Kim looked at me with a hunger, while Tasha looked intrigued and Rochelle just looked shocked.

""Y'all really laughing right now?"" I asked, my voice flat. ""We’re under siege.""

""I think I found it!"" Tyson yelled from the coffee table, slamming a heavy, leather-bound urban legend book down.

""Not sure, but this has to be it,"" Rico added, leaning over his shoulder.

They started talking at once, cutting each other off in a frantic blur of information.

""Shut up! One at a time!"" Rochelle snapped.

Tyson took a breath. ""The book says spirits don't just stay because they’re mean. They stay because of a tether. If they died in terror, or if their 'resting spot' was desecrated. Ant, the city tore those houses down. They bulldozed her life while she was probably still under the floorboards.""

""What if,"" Rico started, but Tasha cut him off, her eyes wide and beaming with a terrifying clarity.

""What if something of hers remains?"" she whispered.

""Something they didn't bulldoze. Something still in that cellar.""

THUD-THUD-THUD.

The basement and the attic erupted at the same time.

It sounded like heavy boots were sprinting across the ceiling while something massive was slamming against the pipes below.

""Damn,"" I whispered, the word feeling small against the noise.

""No,"" Rochelle said, her voice rising. ""You can’t mean we have to—""

""Hell No,"" Kim added, her bravado finally shattering. ""I don’t want to do that.""

""We need to go back into the house,"" Tyson, Tasha, and Rico said in a chilling, accidental unison.

""Are you insane?"" I stepped away from the wall.

""Look what happened just because we touched the porch! We’ve been followed, whispered to, and toyed with all day.

We go into her domain, who knows what that Thing will do to us!""

""If we don't, we’re just waiting to die in here!"" Rico screamed.

Rochelle retreated to the kitchen, her hands over her ears.

Suddenly, the house phone didn't just ring—it flew off the wall, a wet, slurping gurgle began to pour out of the receiver.

Rochelle frantically unplugged it from the wall jack, but the sound didn't stop.

It got louder.

The unplugged phone was screaming a woman’s agony into the kitchen air.

Then, the world went black.

The power didn't just flicker; it died.

I looked out the window.

The entire block was swallowed in a void.

No streetlights.

No porch lights.

Just the rain.

I looked toward the abandoned house. A single, faint candlelight flickered in the parlor window. And then, she was there.

Not a shadow.

Not a reflection.

The Pig-Lady was standing right against the glass of Rico's living room window, inches from my face.

Up close, she was a nightmare of biology.

Her skin was the color of a drowned corpse, stretched tight over a massive, thick neck.

The snout was raw, weeping pink fluid, with jagged yellow tusks piercing through her lower lip.

Her eyes were tiny, black, and filled with an ancient, predatory intelligence.

I scrambled back, falling over the coffee table, my heart almost stopping in my chest.

For the next twenty minutes, the house was a drum.

Banging, rattling, and scratching engulfed us from every direction. It was a swarm of sound, a physical assault on our senses.

Then, as quickly as it started, it fell into a deafening silence.

Rico and Rochelle moved like ghosts, fumbling through the dark until they found three heavy mag-lite flashlights and a box of batteries.

""We have to go,"" Rico whispered.

A flash of lightning illuminated the room.

A massive, towering shadow of the Pig-Lady was projected onto the living room wall, looming over us like a god of the slaughterhouse.

It lingered for three seconds, then faded into the dark.

""I can't... I can't do this,"" Kim sobbed, clutching my pinstriped shirt.

""We don't have a choice,"" I said, my voice shaking as I took one of the flashlights.

""She's not letting us stay, and she's not letting us leave. The only way is through.""

We stood at the front door, six kids clutching each other as the storm raged outside.

We stepped out into the rain, the flashlights cutting weak holes in the darkness, heading toward the house that shouldn't be there.

The field didn't feel like dirt and weeds anymore.

It felt like a vast, black ocean, and the House was a jagged rock waiting to wreck us.

We had only been walking for thirty seconds, but the space between Rico’s porch and that rotting Victorian stretched.

The darkness was a physical thing, swallowing the light from our flashlights as soon as it left the lenses.

""Stay in the light! Just stay in the light!"" Kim hissed, her voice cracking.

She, Tasha, and Rochelle were huddled so close together they were tripping over each other.

I saw the terror in their eyes and handed my flashlight to Kim. Rico followed my lead, handing his to Tasha.

Rochelle already had the heavy mag-lite.

The three of them held the beams like shields, creating small, shaking circles of yellow light against the grey, rain-slicked wood of the House.

We reached the porch. The storm was screaming now, soaking our clothes until they felt like lead weights.

""Open it,"" Tyson whispered, his jaw set.

Rochelle reached for the knob.

It wouldn't budge.

We pushed.

We kicked.

The wood felt like solid iron.

From behind the door, the sound started—a wet, rhythmic sliding, like a massive slab of meat being dragged across salt.

It grew louder, punctuated by that congested, bubbling snort.

""It’s trying to keep us out!"" Tasha cried, the beam of her flashlight dancing wildly.

""Or it’s holding the door shut from the other side,"" Rico growled.

""Ant, Tyson—on three!""

The three of us threw our shoulders against the door.

Once.

Twice.

The house groaned, a deep, structural sound that felt like a warning.

On the fifth try, the frame splintered with a sound like a gunshot, and the door burst open.

The air inside was stagnant and smelled of copper and old grease.

Shadows didn't just sit in the corners; they danced, elongating along the peeling wallpaper as the girls' flashlights swept the room.

Disembodied whispers—high, chattering sounds that weren't quite human—drifted from the vents.

""What are we even looking for?"" Kim whispered, her light trembling. ""A heart? A bone? What binds a monster?""

""Anything that doesn't belong,"" I said, though nothing in this nightmare felt like it belonged.

Suddenly, a flash of movement.

The Pig-Lady appeared at the end of the dining room, her hunched back silhouetted by Tasha’s light.

She vanished before the beam could fully find her, leaving only deep, fresh claw marks gouged into the plaster.

She was taunting us, skittering through the walls like a roach.

""Second floor,"" Rochelle commanded. ""We clear it and move up.""

The moment our feet hit the second-floor landing, the House lost its mind.

The floorboards bucked and shook.

A heavy oak nightstand in the master bedroom suddenly took flight, hurling itself across the room and shattering against the wall inches from Rico’s head.

""She’s getting angry!"" Rico yelled over the roar of the house.

At the end of the long, narrow hallway, she appeared again.

This time, she didn't run. She stood tall, her elongated limbs twitching.

She opened her maw a horrific mess of tusks and grey tongue and let out a scream.

It wasn't a vocal sound; it was the sound of a thousand pigs being slaughtered, mixed with a woman’s desperate sob.

""Hide! Into the room!""

I lunged for the nearest doorway.

We huddled in the dark, the six of us breathing in syncopated gasps.

""She’s right there,"" Tasha whimpered. ""She’s right outside the door.""

I waited until the screaming faded into a low, gurgled humming.

I poked my head out.

The hall was empty, but the walls were weeping a dark, oily fluid.

""Coast is clear. Move,"" I whispered.

We finished the second floor, finding nothing but decay.

The only place left was up.

The attic.

We climbed the narrow, winding stairs, the wood screaming under our shoes.

The attic was a whirlwind of chaos.

As soon as we stepped inside, the room began to shake uncontrollably.

Old trunks burst open, shattering against the rafters.

Then, from the dark corner, a black cloud erupted.

A flock of starlings, hundreds of them, shrieked as they flew directly at us, their wings beating against our faces before they smashed through the attic window and into the storm.

""Look at the wall!"" Kim screamed.

A shadow loomed over us.

It wasn't our shadow. It was hers.

Then, a sound came from far below.

Not from the attic.

Not from the second floor.

A deafening, earth-shaking shriek echoed up from the very bowels of the structure.

""The basement,"" Tasha whispered, her eyes wide with a horrific realization.

""Tyson, the report said the pigs were in the cellar. The tether... it’s under our feet.""

The House went pitch black as the girls' flashlights flickered and dimmed, the air turning ice-cold.

We were in the throat of the beast now, and it was starting to swallow.

The descent to the basement was a trip into certain danger. The air grew thick, humid, and smelled so strongly of copper and raw sewage that Kim had to cover her mouth to keep from gagging.

The flashlights were dying, the beams yellowing and flickering as if the house itself were draining the batteries.

""The cellar,"" Tasha whispered, her voice trembling. ""The report... the pigs... it all ends down here."" We reached the bottom of the wooden stairs.

The basement floor wasn't concrete; it was packed dirt, slick with a black, oily moisture.

In the center of the room sat a massive, cast-iron furnace, its rusted pipes reaching upward like the ribcage of a titan.

""Look for it!"" Tyson hissed. ""The tether! Anything that doesn't belong!""

Suddenly, the temperature plummeted. Our breath came out in thick white plumes.

From the darkness behind the furnace, a wet, rhythmic thud-thud-thud emerged.

Rochelle turned her light toward the sound.

The Pig-Lady was there, crouched in a way that no human spine should allow.

She didn't scream this time. She moved with a terrifying, silent fluidity. Before Rico could scream, she was on him.

She didn't bite—she simply reached out an elongated, grey finger and touched his bare forearm. Rico let out a sound I will never forget—a choked, guttural whimper.

Where she touched him, the skin instantly blackened and withered, a permanent, rotted brand.

He collapsed, clutching his arm. ""GET AWAY FROM HIM!"" I yelled.

She snarled, a sound like steam escaping a pipe, and vanished into the shadows. ""The furnace!"" Rochelle shouted, her light hitting the rusted ash door of the old heater.

""Look inside!"" Tyson kicked the iron door open.

We leaned in, our lights converging on the grey ash inside. There, nestled in the soot, was a jagged, yellowed piece of a human jawbone.

It was small—delicate—still holding three blackened teeth. ""That's it,"" I whispered. ""That's her. That's what's left.""

The house screamed then.

Not the walls—the structure.

The dirt floor began to heave. The Pig-Lady materialized at the foot of the stairs, her body stretching and warping until she blocked our only exit.

She let out a roar that vibrated the very marrow in our bones.

""WE HAVE TO BURY IT!"" Tasha screamed. ""THE SOIL OUTSIDE!""

""Ant, take the girls and the bone! GO!"" Tyson yelled, stepping forward. Rico, ashen-faced and clutching his arm, stood beside him.

""We’ll hold her! RUN!"" ""No! We stay together!"" I protested.

""GO, ANTHONY!"" Rico roared, the terror in his voice replaced by a desperate, final bravado.

Tyson and Rico lunged at the entity, their shouts lost in her deafening squeal. In the chaos, I grabbed the jawbone it was ice-cold, but burning my palm and I shoved the girls toward a small, high coal-chute window.

We scrambled through the narrow opening, skin tearing on the rusted metal, and tumbled into the mud and rain of the field.

""Bury it! Deep!"" I shouted.

We fell to our knees in the center of the sour dirt, clawing at the earth with our bare hands. The rain turned the dirt to a thick, black sludge.

Behind us, the House was convulsing. Light—sickly, strobe like flashes erupted from every window.

""Down here!"" Rochelle cried, slamming the jawbone into a hole and mashing the dirt over it. As the last bit of white bone disappeared beneath the mud, a sound like a thunderclap echoed from the House.

The side of the Victorian exploded.

Siding, ancient timber, and shards of glass flew into the night like shrapnel.

The Pig-Lady burst through the wreckage. She stood on the edge of the field, silhouetted by the lightning. She let out a sound that defied nature—a layered, agonizing howl that started as a woman’s cry and ended as a mechanical shriek.

Tyson and Rico burst out of the front door a second later, sprinting for their lives as the House began to fold.

It didn't fall down. It fell in.

The walls bent like wet paper, the roof spinning into the center of the structure.

A massive cloud of grey dust and white fog billowed outward, swallowing the field, the Pig-Lady, and the sky. We huddled together in the mud, shielding our faces.

Slowly, the dust settled.

The rain began to wash away the haze.

We looked up. The House was gone. There was no rubble. No broken glass. No splintered wood.

Not even a footprint in the dirt where the foundation had been. The field was perfectly, terrifyingly flat. Just dirt, weeds, and the memory of a nightmare.

""Is it over?"" Kim whispered, soaked and muddy, her long hair matted to her face.

""She's gone,"" Tasha breathed, staring at the spot where we buried the bone.

Rico sat in the mud, staring at his arm. The black, hoof-shaped brand remained, a dark reminder that some things can't be buried.

Tyson dropped, his Biggie shirt torn to rags. Looking back at Rico’s house, which sat silent and dark across the street. I whispered, ""It’s just a field again.""

""No,"" Rochelle said, her voice hollow. ""It’s a grave. And we’re the only ones who know who’s in it.""

I didn't speak of that house after that day. Not to my mom, not to the police, and eventually, not even to the people who were there with me.

We stayed in Rico’s living room that final Sunday night, huddled together with every light in the house blazing once the power flickered back on.

We didn't sleep.

We didn't even close our eyes. We just sat there, listening to the silence of the field—a silence that felt heavier than the screams had ever been.

Days turned into weeks, and for a while, we were inseparable.

We were bound by the dirt under our fingernails and the copper smell that wouldn't leave our clothes. We would meet up every day after school, sitting on Rico’s porch, staring at the empty lot.

We were waiting for it to come back. We were waiting for the ground to heave again.

But it never did.

Weeks turned into months, and the trauma began to do what time always does: it eroded the edges. The shared looks became too painful.

Every time I looked at Rico, I saw him scratching at that black, hoof-shaped brand on his arm—a mark that never faded, never scarred, just stayed there like a piece of charcoal embedded in his skin.

Every time I saw Tasha, I saw the hollow vacancy in her eyes.

Months turned into years, and the six of us grew apart.

It wasn't an argument or a falling out. It was just an unspoken agreement that to see one another was to remember.

We moved out of the neighborhood. We went to different colleges. We changed our numbers.

I think it’s been something like ten years since the last time any of us spoke.

I heard through the grapevine that Tyson moved down south, trying to find a place where the air didn't smell like Detroit rain.

I heard Rochelle became a teacher, though they say she never keeps mirrors in her classroom. As for Kim and Tasha, they’re just shadows in my memory now.

But no matter how much I wish to forget that damn weekend, no matter how much time has passed, the memory remains fresh, as if it just happened yesterday. I still can't use a microwave without flinching at the beeps. I still can't look at a steamed-up bathroom mirror without my heart stopping.

If you’re ever find yourself in Detroit, and you see a field that looks a little too wide, or a patch of dirt where nothing grows... don't stop.

The last two coffee shops I’ve worked at this year, every time I’m on bar, my coworker on register comes over and starts helping me make the drinks (if im pulling shots, setting up the cup, the coworker starts steaming the milk for the drink and then finishes it). I’m 28, worked in coffee for almost 10 years now, and I’ve always worked places where if you’re on bar, you finish the drinks all the way through. Only if it’s super slammed will you have another person on bar, and usually they’re working on a different drink, not helping you complete one drink. It throws me off and feels super unnecessary. I’ve worked in really busy shops by myself, I can make drinks efficiently, I don’t need help (again, unless it’s super busy and I’d rather them just work on the next drink). I like to switch off on register and bar and I basically just trust that my coworker can handle making a certain number of drinks in good timing, because that’s our job. So if I’m on register, I don’t try to help unless they ask or seem to need it.

I Didn’t Believe Him.,"My family went through a good number of pets while I was growing up. Dogs, cats, fish, and even a couple birds. My parents tended to adopt from shelters and the pound, meaning they were often already pretty old, so we didn’t usually have any given pet for too long. 



Because of that, I quickly learned to accept death for what it was. When it was time for them to go, it was time for them to go. My dad would put them in a box, put that box in a car, and take them to get cremated.



I’d often wonder why my dad was the one doing it. Most of our pets seemed wary of him, scurrying away at his sight, whimpering and tucking their tails. I wondered if they would want him handling their bodies. 



He’d always come back reeking of smoke and copper. I figured the cremation process must not be easy. 



He’d always tell me not to worry, that they were in Heaven, watching over me from above. It was on those nights in particular that I would imagine them above my bed, watching me, talking to me. Sometimes it felt like they were reaching down and tapping on my ceiling. Like they were in the attic.



Of course, I wasn’t allowed in there. As a kid, not being allowed in the attic felt like a justifiable and logical rule. Dad’s space. Simple as that.



That’s why there was a padlock keeping the entrance shut. Even my mom didn’t get to go up there. She told me that he was just protective over his train models. I wondered if train models made the shuttering noises that I heard sometimes from above. 



Dragging, bumping, scratching. I would hear it on quiet nights. I told myself they were the sounds of the house settling. 



I got an answer when I was fifteen.



My dad sat me down one afternoon to talk to me, a stern look on his face.



“Chris, there’s a portal to Hell in our attic.” His wide eyes were trained on me.



“What?” I started to smile, unable to take his statement seriously.



“The demon who resides on the other side is named Alloces. He requests regular sacrifices.” 



“Dad, what are you talking about? Are you okay?” My smile turned sideways.



“I’ve been feeding him our pets. I don’t know how much longer it’ll work. He has the face of a lion and rides upon a dark horse,” he said, looking as if he could begin crying at any moment.



“You’re starting to scare me… knock it off. Seriously.” 



“I’m only telling you this because some day you’ll have to deal with it. You’re old enough to hear this. Don’t tell your mom. She doesn’t think you should know.” With that, he stood up and left the room abruptly.



He never told me more about it, even when prompted. I reluctantly followed his rules about the attic and about not telling mom anyways.



That was almost ten years ago. 



Just over a year ago, my mom called me. Dad was missing. Apparently he had been gone for a good while and she was just too scared to face the truth. By then, no one had seen a trace of him for nearly two months. 



I was furious at her for keeping it secret. Because of that, there was almost no way the police would be able to find him anymore. Regardless, I travelled home to help with whatever I could. 



The house was an unkempt wreck. The plants in the yard and around the house were all grey and decaying. The place looked as if it were antithetical to life itself. 



Only a few days into moving boxes and doing various house chores, I began to think back to that conversation with my dad. The lock on the attic door. The grinding sounds. I decided to check it out. I waited until my mom was asleep one night and approached the ceiling door.



It only took a few light strikes with a hammer to the lock to render years of secrecy obsolete. The ladder swung down with a metallic creak that resembled nails on a chalkboard. The light from my flashlight bounced off dust particles that drifted down. I planted one foot on the bottom rung and began my ascent. 



The thick scent of smoke began to fill my nostrils alongside a different, stranger tone. Something sickly sweet, like rotting fruit. I peeked my head above the floorboard and shined the flashlight above me, reflecting wood panels and pinkish insulation that suggested a very normal attic. I set the flashlight down and clambered the rest of the way up.



It appeared that the far wall of the room was much further away than I expected it to be. It was only when I picked the flashlight back up that a crimson light revealed itself to me upon the floor.



Covering the entire width of the attic was a giant square painted to the ground in dark red. Multiple intersecting lines that resembled crosses were on the inside of the square, alongside two U-shapes and several circles, one on the outside of each corner and two inside. The entirety of it was maybe 15 feet long diagonally and created with incredible precision.



My mind conjured images of sigils from movies and I thought about the lion-headed beast again. My toes began to tingle and something in the recesses of my brain told me to leave. Quickly scanning the rest of the room, I saw a completely empty attic otherwise only containing decaying cobwebs and the painting.



I descended the steps and shut the attic door quietly.



I questioned my mom the next morning.



“Do you think dad was ever… secretive about the attic? About what he did in there?” My question sat still in the air for a moment.



“Well, sure, I suppose. It was for his train models, you know that,” she said with a quaver that sounded as if she was trying to convince herself of the truth.



“Mom, I… I know there weren’t trains in there.” I set my coffee down on the table. “Why did he put a lock on it?”



“Honey, don’t be silly. It's God’s honest truth.”



I leaned in closer to her. “Dad once told me what was up there. He said you knew about it too.”



Her eyes darkened and avoided my gaze. “Your father… if I’m really being honest with you, was disturbed. He had mental troubles that we both tried to keep from you.”



“What kind of troubles?” My voice quieted.



“The kind that children have no right messing with.” She was beginning to get visibly upset. “The kind that drives people to do things that aren’t right.”



“What did he do? What about our pets?” The question lingered.



She muttered to herself. “He kept us safe. He kept *you* safe.”



“What?” My eyes widened.



“Honey, I–I can’t,” she said, tears welling in her eyes. She struggled to speak. “We aren’t talking about this anymore.” She stood up and quickly left the kitchen.



She avoided me from then on. I eventually decided after another week to leave and go back to my life. I complied with the police as far as I had to and tried to ignore the home. 



Only another month later, I received a call from the same police. My mother had gone missing. I was appalled. Losing both parents in such quick succession was such a shock that I could scarcely believe it. I could hardly even feel upset. I went back home again to work with the police and to keep up the house.



In my efforts for the investigation, I explained to them what I had seen in the attic the month prior. They asked me to help them check it out again. I nervously agreed.



I led two detectives into the space during an early afternoon. Upon entering, it was abundantly clear to me that something was different.



“This… this isn’t right. This was way bigger last time.” I paced the length of the room.



“Bigger? You mean this thing?” The senior detective pointed to the dusty sigil on the floor.



“No. The room itself. That wall must be at least ten feet closer than before.” I rested my hand upon the opposing wall. 



“Well, I suppose there could be a false wall. Are you sure?” The senior detective gave a scrutinizing look to his partner.



“Positive,” I said.



Within a few minutes, I found a hammer downstairs and we managed to bust a small divot into the wall. Light streamed through.



Impossible. The other side of the hole was the outside world. I could make out the front driveway through it. My stomach lurched and I decided to leave the room.



The detectives finished their work and left. They noted the structural anomaly but were more interested in the sigil. I was left completely confused. How was that possible? The length of the attic from entrance to the wall shouldn’t even be able to reach the front of the house. 



I waited without an answer. The investigation never turned up much and eventually settled into the backs of cabinets and grew dusty. I continued to stay at the house over the next year as the owner and only possible caretaker. 



I did what I could for the house but it never really felt comfortable again. The grass in the yard eventually completely gave up and the surrounding shrubs fell after. The overpowering smell of smoke wafted through the home and became constant. That whole time, I avoided that attic like the plague.



Of course, I had my theories about the attic. About the sigil and the demon my father named. I looked it up. Lo and behold, Alloces’s sigil was the very same one above my head. I wondered how real and necessary the “sacrifices” my father spoke of were. 



The answer finally thrust itself upon me on a cold, dark night.



I was laying in my bed, unable to sleep when I heard it. Grinding, bending, creaking, the same that I used to hear when I was a kid, the kind that I thought came from my pets. I shot up in bed, rubbing my eyes. There is no dad to make those sounds anymore. No trains. No pets. No excuses for my mind to imagine. I had to see what was up there.



Before pulling the cord to the attic, I considered the sacrifices. How they may settle the demon. It had been at least a full year since my mom had gone missing. A whole year since the last possible time a sacrifice may have been made. Even longer if I have hope for either of my parents’ lives. I couldn’t go in without a plan.



The next day I gathered what I needed. Against my own moral standards, I lured a stray cat with food and captured it in a backpack. Zipping it up, the cat thrashed violently as I slung it onto my back. I grabbed a flashlight with fresh batteries, a kitchen knife, and the same hammer I had broken a hole in the wall with.



The attic door lowered itself with a slow wheeze that sent a shiver down my spine. A huge cloud of dust–no, smoke–fell upon me from the darkness. My body was screaming at me not to go. I had to force my statue-like body to clamber up the ladder.



When my head entered the space, a cold, harsh wind slammed into me, making my eyes water. Looking around, I could see *nothing*. It was pitch black in every direction. Smoke enveloped the air around me.



I timidly raised the rest of my body into the space and took a step forward. Directing my flashlight around me, it only settled upon thick smog. No walls were close enough to catch in the light, no matter the direction. The sigil remained on the floor in front of me. 



“Hello?” I called out loudly. My voice left my lips and was sucked into the black void. No sound came back other than the wind. Not even an echo.



I began to walk.



Ten steps forward, there was still no sign of a wall. 



Another ten steps. Nothing. 



Forty more steps. Still nothing.



My teeth began to chatter in the cold and I wondered if I should go back. I turned around and could only barely make out the glow of the attic door on the floor in the distance. I foolishly determined that I should go until I found a wall. In theory, I should be able to bust a hole and leave through there. 



I stopped counting my steps after around five hundred. 



After what felt like 30 minutes, my flashlight finally illuminated something. Before me was a greyish pile of what looked like thin sticks and rocks covered in thin fabric. When I got closer, I realized what it actually was.



A desolate corpse of a large dog was splayed out as if it had died belly-up. The bones were darkened and the pale skin barely draped over the ribcage. The empty sockets of the skull expressed a feeling of dread that I struggled to comprehend. I reached back in my memory to all the childhood dogs I owned. This one was unrecognizable.



I found at least a dozen more dogs and cats of varying sizes and degrees of mummification over the next hour of walking. The further I went, the more prevalent they became.



At a certain point, the ground was littered with animal corpses. Ones that surely hadn’t come from my family. It became difficult to walk without stepping on them. That familiar, sickly sweet scent of death took over the smoke in my nose and danced across my tongue and down my throat. I felt the weight of the cat that had long since given up its attempts at escape on my back. 



*Arghhhhhh!*



I heard the pained cry from far away, in a direction that wasn’t completely obvious. As I jutted along with noodle-like limbs, the cries and shouts became enveloping and constant. The sounds of many. It was then louder than the wind.



The oppressive darkness suddenly felt less open and empty. I could feel the presence of someone, something, or many, just outside the cone of my flashlight. Waiting to snap me up in huge jaws and destroy me.



The crunch of bones snapping under immense weight began to hit my ears in a regular pattern from in front of me. I heard the sound of some huge beast breathing labored breaths. I trained my flashlight, quivering violently in my hand, in the direction of the sound. I stood still. I could scarcely breathe.



A ragged, ghastly figure appeared in my sight. It floated maybe eight feet above the ground. It was the figure of a woman. As it floated closer, I could make out the face. It was my mother. Barely recognizable. Blackened and decaying. Something sharp and shining protruded from her chest.



The second figure appeared several feet behind her. Another human corpse floated in line. It was the gaunt, bony, older visage of my father. When they were about ten feet from me, I finally realized what carried them.



Both bodies were impaled upon a huge metal spear whose carrier was yet still invisible to me. My stomach heaved bile from deep within and out of my mouth onto some poor corpse beneath my feet. I could barely stand, my legs shaking badly.



As my parents glided towards me, I heard the breathing grow stronger. I turned my flashlight to the left, and the head of a giant horse protruded out of the dark. Its black fur was mangy and the skin a sickly blue. It huffed dramatically, steaming air billowing out from huge nostrils.



The spear and its victims began to glide towards me with a quicker pace. I took a terrified step backwards and tripped on a bone, launching me backwards. I collapsed onto my back, the cat within the backpack screeching in shock. The flashlight fell from my hand, its light beaming wildly across the corpses littering the floor. I scrambled to my feet, my hands now coated in dead skin-cobwebs as I reached for the light. I started taking quick, determined steps away from the spear and the horse.



As I reached a running pace, the galloping of the horse became insistent and louder. It would reach me before I could escape. I had no other choice.



I had to do it.



While racing away, I swung the backpack over my shoulders, resting over my stomach. I pulled the knife from the side pocket and held it in my right hand, the flashlight trained forwards in my left.



With intensely vibrating hands, I wiped a tear from my eyes and plunged the knife into the bag. It tore past the fabric like paper, sinking into a soft mass like room temperature butter. The cat began to shriek violently and tear at the insides of the bag. I exhaled with a shocked groan and pulled the knife out, now dark with blood.



I stabbed the bag a dozen more times, the cat shrieking and shaking less and less each time. After a definitive final plunge of the knife, the thrashing stopped. I felt hot blood soak into my shirt and drip down onto my pants. 



Almost immediately, I heard the floor below me shudder like a tree being felled. Turning around, the horse was gone. I stopped running and stood still to witness the environment around me.



The smoke started to dissipate. My flashlight quickly found a wooden wall just a few feet from me. Rotating around me, I could find a rectangle of walls and a roof all around me within a normal attic-sized radius. The sigil was now below me, glowing a bright red. 



The bloodied knife slipped from my hand and clattered to the ground. The open attic door was now just a couple feet before me. I dropped the backpack onto the sigil, its glow intensifying. I rushed to the ladder and practically flew down it.



The cool, tile floor of the hallway never felt so inviting. I slammed the ceiling door shut and sunk to the ground, sobbing. 



That was yesterday. I’ve written all this down since then just to get a grip on everything that's happened here. I don’t know much about demons or Hell or anything of the occult. I’m not totally sure what I saw. But I won’t enter that attic again.

I Didn’t Believe Him.,"My family went through a good number of pets while I was growing up. Dogs, cats, fish, and even a couple birds. My parents tended to adopt from shelters and the pound, meaning they were often already pretty old, so we didn’t usually have any given pet for too long. 



Because of that, I quickly learned to accept death for what it was. When it was time for them to go, it was time for them to go. My dad would put them in a box, put that box in a car, and take them to get cremated.



I’d often wonder why my dad was the one doing it. Most of our pets seemed wary of him, scurrying away at his sight, whimpering and tucking their tails. I wondered if they would want him handling their bodies. 



He’d always come back reeking of smoke and copper. I figured the cremation process must not be easy. 



He’d always tell me not to worry, that they were in Heaven, watching over me from above. It was on those nights in particular that I would imagine them above my bed, watching me, talking to me. Sometimes it felt like they were reaching down and tapping on my ceiling. Like they were in the attic.



Of course, I wasn’t allowed in there. As a kid, not being allowed in the attic felt like a justifiable and logical rule. Dad’s space. Simple as that.



That’s why there was a padlock keeping the entrance shut. Even my mom didn’t get to go up there. She told me that he was just protective over his train models. I wondered if train models made the shuttering noises that I heard sometimes from above. 



Dragging, bumping, scratching. I would hear it on quiet nights. I told myself they were the sounds of the house settling. 



I got an answer when I was fifteen.



My dad sat me down one afternoon to talk to me, a stern look on his face.



“Chris, there’s a portal to Hell in our attic.” His wide eyes were trained on me.



“What?” I started to smile, unable to take his statement seriously.



“The demon who resides on the other side is named Alloces. He requests regular sacrifices.” 



“Dad, what are you talking about? Are you okay?” My smile turned sideways.



“I’ve been feeding him our pets. I don’t know how much longer it’ll work. He has the face of a lion and rides upon a dark horse,” he said, looking as if he could begin crying at any moment.



“You’re starting to scare me… knock it off. Seriously.” 



“I’m only telling you this because some day you’ll have to deal with it. You’re old enough to hear this. Don’t tell your mom. She doesn’t think you should know.” With that, he stood up and left the room abruptly.



He never told me more about it, even when prompted. I reluctantly followed his rules about the attic and about not telling mom anyways.



That was almost ten years ago. 



Just over a year ago, my mom called me. Dad was missing. Apparently he had been gone for a good while and she was just too scared to face the truth. By then, no one had seen a trace of him for nearly two months. 



I was furious at her for keeping it secret. Because of that, there was almost no way the police would be able to find him anymore. Regardless, I travelled home to help with whatever I could. 



The house was an unkempt wreck. The plants in the yard and around the house were all grey and decaying. The place looked as if it were antithetical to life itself. 



Only a few days into moving boxes and doing various house chores, I began to think back to that conversation with my dad. The lock on the attic door. The grinding sounds. I decided to check it out. I waited until my mom was asleep one night and approached the ceiling door.



It only took a few light strikes with a hammer to the lock to render years of secrecy obsolete. The ladder swung down with a metallic creak that resembled nails on a chalkboard. The light from my flashlight bounced off dust particles that drifted down. I planted one foot on the bottom rung and began my ascent. 



The thick scent of smoke began to fill my nostrils alongside a different, stranger tone. Something sickly sweet, like rotting fruit. I peeked my head above the floorboard and shined the flashlight above me, reflecting wood panels and pinkish insulation that suggested a very normal attic. I set the flashlight down and clambered the rest of the way up.



It appeared that the far wall of the room was much further away than I expected it to be. It was only when I picked the flashlight back up that a crimson light revealed itself to me upon the floor.



Covering the entire width of the attic was a giant square painted to the ground in dark red. Multiple intersecting lines that resembled crosses were on the inside of the square, alongside two U-shapes and several circles, one on the outside of each corner and two inside. The entirety of it was maybe 15 feet long diagonally and created with incredible precision.



My mind conjured images of sigils from movies and I thought about the lion-headed beast again. My toes began to tingle and something in the recesses of my brain told me to leave. Quickly scanning the rest of the room, I saw a completely empty attic otherwise only containing decaying cobwebs and the painting.



I descended the steps and shut the attic door quietly.



I questioned my mom the next morning.



“Do you think dad was ever… secretive about the attic? About what he did in there?” My question sat still in the air for a moment.



“Well, sure, I suppose. It was for his train models, you know that,” she said with a quaver that sounded as if she was trying to convince herself of the truth.



“Mom, I… I know there weren’t trains in there.” I set my coffee down on the table. “Why did he put a lock on it?”



“Honey, don’t be silly. It's God’s honest truth.”



I leaned in closer to her. “Dad once told me what was up there. He said you knew about it too.”



Her eyes darkened and avoided my gaze. “Your father… if I’m really being honest with you, was disturbed. He had mental troubles that we both tried to keep from you.”



“What kind of troubles?” My voice quieted.



“The kind that children have no right messing with.” She was beginning to get visibly upset. “The kind that drives people to do things that aren’t right.”



“What did he do? What about our pets?” The question lingered.



She muttered to herself. “He kept us safe. He kept *you* safe.”



“What?” My eyes widened.



“Honey, I–I can’t,” she said, tears welling in her eyes. She struggled to speak. “We aren’t talking about this anymore.” She stood up and quickly left the kitchen.



She avoided me from then on. I eventually decided after another week to leave and go back to my life. I complied with the police as far as I had to and tried to ignore the home. 



Only another month later, I received a call from the same police. My mother had gone missing. I was appalled. Losing both parents in such quick succession was such a shock that I could scarcely believe it. I could hardly even feel upset. I went back home again to work with the police and to keep up the house.



In my efforts for the investigation, I explained to them what I had seen in the attic the month prior. They asked me to help them check it out again. I nervously agreed.



I led two detectives into the space during an early afternoon. Upon entering, it was abundantly clear to me that something was different.



“This… this isn’t right. This was way bigger last time.” I paced the length of the room.



“Bigger? You mean this thing?” The senior detective pointed to the dusty sigil on the floor.



“No. The room itself. That wall must be at least ten feet closer than before.” I rested my hand upon the opposing wall. 



“Well, I suppose there could be a false wall. Are you sure?” The senior detective gave a scrutinizing look to his partner.



“Positive,” I said.



Within a few minutes, I found a hammer downstairs and we managed to bust a small divot into the wall. Light streamed through.



Impossible. The other side of the hole was the outside world. I could make out the front driveway through it. My stomach lurched and I decided to leave the room.



The detectives finished their work and left. They noted the structural anomaly but were more interested in the sigil. I was left completely confused. How was that possible? The length of the attic from entrance to the wall shouldn’t even be able to reach the front of the house. 



I waited without an answer. The investigation never turned up much and eventually settled into the backs of cabinets and grew dusty. I continued to stay at the house over the next year as the owner and only possible caretaker. 



I did what I could for the house but it never really felt comfortable again. The grass in the yard eventually completely gave up and the surrounding shrubs fell after. The overpowering smell of smoke wafted through the home and became constant. That whole time, I avoided that attic like the plague.

1r79ypb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1r79ypb/at_209_hours_my_1st_progress_report/,At 209 hours - my 1st progress report,"I am a former high school English teacher. My primary exposure to a second language was 3 years of Latin. I figured, based on my Latin exposure and a solid month of Spanish on Duolingo, I should be able to learn Spanish pretty easily. So, around Christmas, I took the plunge!

I’ve been studying Spanish for just over two months now, and I figured it was time for my first post about what I’m doing and what I’ve discovered so far.

I originally started with two online classes a week with a tutor from Colombia. He told me listening was extremely important, so I downloaded the Spanish translation of *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* and tried playing the first chapter. It didn’t take long to realize… that was a complete waste of time.

My tutor also suggested watching native YouTube content. I tried that too. Same result: I couldn’t understand a single word. It was just noise. Then I discovered a superbeginner Dreaming Spanish video (Shel trying to order a coffee).

I watched it and I actually understood it. That was the first time I felt like real acquisition might be happening. So I subscribed to Premium and took the placement test. DS estimated I had about 150 hours of prior input and put my video level around 45.

That was… wildly optimistic, to say the least. I quickly realized I needed to go back to around level 20. Since then, over about a month and a half, I’ve worked my way from level 20 to level 35 by watching Dreaming Spanish consistently.

But about two weeks ago, I hit a frustration point. 

Everything started to feel random. Random topics, random vocabulary, random situations. I found myself wishing there were more structured reinforcement of certain words and grammar patterns. As an adult learner, I started wondering if purely random input might be a bit inefficient for me personally. And since I'm the type of person to confront and solve frustration I started hunting for a solution, and I discovered LingQ.

LingQ[ ](https://www.lingq.com/?referral=cdmurphy)is a reading/listening platform with graded stories. You can flag unknown words and they go into a review deck. It also has audio for everything, and you can upload your own text and convert it to audio.

So I tried an experiment - I went to ChatGPT and asked it to generate a story containing vocabulary related to kitchen items, table settings, and cooking tools. I asked it to repeat those words in different contexts throughout the story. It produced a story about someone preparing a meal, setting the table, eating, cleaning up, and putting everything away.

I uploaded that to LingQ and read it. When I finished, I realized… I actually knew those words.

So I started doing this with other topics: creating short, structured, comprehensible stories built around specific vocabulary or concepts I wanted to reinforce.

Here’s my process:

* I read the story once and flag unknown words
* Then I listen while reading along **three times**
* Then I listen **twice without the text**

This keeps the process listening-heavy while still letting me notice new vocabulary. The repetition helps me internalize sounds, rhythm, and sentence flow.

Then I had another idea: What if I used this method for grammar concepts from my tutoring sessions?

For example, my tutor had just gone over the difference between **por qué / porque / porqué / por que**. Instead of studying rules, I asked AI to generate four short stories that used all four forms naturally and repeatedly.

I went through three of the stories using my read-and-listen process. The next morning I woke up with this weird Spanglish sentence in my head: “*El porqué* (The reason) to see you, *por que* (for which) we had to come, was to ask you, *por qué* (why) are you mad at us? *Porque* (Because) we have the right to know.”

And I realized… it worked. (That level of excitement first thing in the morning is better than coffee, by the way!)

I went from not understanding my tutor’s explanation at all, to having an intuitive feel for the differences. Then overnight, that intuitive feel turned into conscious understanding.

I repeated the same process with **por vs. para** and got similar results.

So my current plan is:

**1 hour/day** of Dreaming Spanish and **30 minutes/day** of targeted input using LingQ[ ](https://www.lingq.com/?referral=cdmurphy)\+ custom stories

My Dreaming Spanish progress page currently says I have about 209 hours of input (based on its initial estimate plus videos watched). I *feel* slightly behind where I “should” be according to the roadmap, but I’m going to give it another month and see what happens.

A few caveats:

I absolutely agree with the core Dreaming Spanish philosophy, however I’m also a grammar nerd. I like patterns, connections, and structure. So I’m sticking with Dreaming Spanish as my foundation, but I’m adding a targeted, structured layer because I personally think a bit of intentional reinforcement and structured CI might help me move faster as an adult learner.

Right now I’m still not speaking much beyond occasional words or sentences in tutoring sessions. I'm going to continue to hold off on that for a while. I’m mainly focused on input. I’m just experimenting with adding some structure to accelerate the learning while staying true to the CI principles Pablo laid out.

There was once a time I didn’t understand what it is to awaken, sometimes I still don’t or I can’t find the words that resonate, but I guess I don’t need to understand anything or say anything. I just want to live and whatever I’ve been through up until today taught me that I can live at any time I want and I can start any time because it’s always now

What a joy what a pleasure

WHAT A JOY AND WHAT A PLEASURE IT IS TO TYPE THIS MESSAGEEEE

To be a human on reddit typing out another post for anyone to see my words and form an opinion or scroll past without even clicking on it

It feels like it wasn’t too long ago I’d be sleeping at 6pm, waking up around 10pm-midnight, staying up all night staring at a screen, 8am walking to get coffee and wonder what the barrista thought of my face and my voice, then crash out at 12pm until 6pm and continue that cycle

I am so grateful to be here, to be learning(!!!!!!!), to be experiencing, to be crying, to be angry, to be numb, to be here, to be in my head wherever I want to go, to fall asleep without smoking and remember what happened in my dreams

I won’t feel this way all the time but that is the joy of it. Nothing is permanent but I can still try and find balance in it all

My therapist told me that using the word exquisite to describe the balance I would like to see in my life was quite a high standard, that maybe I find it hard to let go of control, I have to have it a certain way, he is right. That is why I have to keep going, does an exquisite balance of our trinity - the mind, body, and soul - exist? I will let you know, I’m great enough to find out and now I’ve started I don’t really want to stop.

A lot of the time I do but nothing is ever finished because you can just carry on right🤷‍♂️

I have built up some momentum in life and now believe I can achieve anything hahahahahah. I love life I really do, it’s nothing like a rollercoaster but physically it is like the ups and downs and the loop de loops are very life esque

1r79wj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r79wj7/sp_the_suit/,[SP] The Suit,"Frank walked into Sarah's super store as a man on a mission. Tonight was the TMMJ Co. ball or gala or something like that. Frank needed a new suit because tonight was special. The other people at the office didn't want to go to the party because they were pussies and scared of the real world, man. Frank needed a new suit but wanted to look cool at the same time, so he opted for something used or older, maybe to give him a cool-guy kind of flair that these sort of uppity folks at an event like this wouldn't have seen before.

Frank entered Sarah's and got pissed off so fast. As soon as he walked in, he saw a group of three young ladies standing, perusing some dresses in the women's section. He looked them over and made eye contact with one of them, who immediately made a face and turned to the other two, and all three started laughing. Sluts, all three of them, showing midriff like that at their age—it was appalling. Frank thought about the pictures of his mother when she was younger. She would have never shown a belly button like that—what the hell, man. She was so beautiful in her prom dress and wedding photos and even the pictures of her on that cruise with her family when she had graduated college. The way her cousin Alan put his arm around her waist had always bothered him, though—what was up with that? Why was he touching her so much? It just made him even angrier.

Feeling tension rising in his body, he tried to wash his mind clean of all these frustrations and just focus on tonight. At the party he could finally meet someone. An actual good lady. Not just some harlot that walked the streets and the hallways at the office—a good, classy woman. At a high-end event like this there would be good, put together young ladies, not just these loose women who roamed the world like stray dogs barking at him and scaring him—a lot, honestly, but he would never say that. His mother would be so happy finally. She would be just like her, and they would get along like the best of friends—he just knew. It was so hard to meet someone nice. Someone who shared the same values and who wasn't just a retard, basically. Women these days just couldn't see through these smoke and mirrors like his mother could.

Frustrated again, Frank took a deep breath and made his way to the men's area, trying not to look back at those young girls who had laughed at him, but he could not resist. Grumbling to himself like Daffy Duck, Frank was immediately made to regret this decision. As soon as he looked back at the ladies, he locked eyes with a strapping young lad who seemed to be a boyfriend to one of the girls and gave him a nasty stare down. ""That guy is such a bitch—I hate that guy—what a pussy just standing there like he's going to do something, or like I even care at all. Those girls all look like streetwalkers anyways. What would I want to do with them?"" Frank thought to himself. If he wasn't in such a hurry, he would have gone over there and given that rascal a piece of his mind.

Frank, then tearing himself from the young man's frightening gaze, pushed into the Sunday best section of the store where the men's dresswear was found, finally clearing his mind and focusing on his true mission.

There was only one other person in the room with him, and he was facing away, looking at the belts and ties. He was a tiny but striking figure. From behind he looked like an artist's take on a sexual cowboy, illustrated and coming to life. Black boots over which jeans, freshly starched, sat. Black belt with a nice red plaid pearl snap button-up. Hair was long and black, slicked back. In a part of his soul with which he would never commune, Frank desired badly to dress like this. But instead he just thought to himself about how that guy was short and it would be terrible to look like that.

Frank tried to focus on looking at suits but found himself gazing back at this itty-bitty, faceless, mesmerizing man. Once or twice the man seemed to be about to turn around, and just as that was about to happen, Frank would snap his head back and keep looking at the same suits. Eventually it became like a game of peekaboo or something. As soon as the man would turn, Frank would snap his head back and look away, wait a few seconds, and slowly look to see if he was looking. Things were starting to heat up, though. The small guy was getting closer, and unconsciously Frank was inching closer to him as they were snailing their ways around the room to each other, closing the distance between them. The closer they got, the louder the smell of the cologne. It was intoxicating. It smelled like rain on a hot summer day mixed with fresh laundry detergent but with something sexy like sandalwood mixed in there.

And then it happened. Frank had just flicked his head away and stared down, and the next time he went to look up, there was his face, only a foot away, staring up at him. He had a thin, well-trimmed mustache and olive-colored skin. Sharp, piercing brown eyes and a large nose. Frank jumped back, absolutely too stunned to speak. What was he doing so close? Frustrated and curiously cautious, Frank was just too overwhelmed to speak in the proximity of this dubious man. Like strings pulling his face tight, a smile spread over his face. It gave him a cheeky, troublemaking sort of look. In a voice that seemed to come from elsewhere, he spoke quietly. Even with the softness that he spoke, his voice had a deep, masculine resonance that matched his figure not at all.

""My friend, I see that you are looking for a suit?""

Frank could only mumble a yes and stepped back once again.

The small man closed the gap and reached out his hand. The way he moved was graceful and serpentine, and it looked as though even with one step, every part of his body moved, no matter what the action.

""I am Rash, what is your name?""

Frank reached his hand out hesitantly, afraid to touch the man's skin, not knowing what it could make him feel. Rough but not dry. Frank tingled and withdrew quickly.

""I'm Frank,"" quick and short was his response. Frank reached into his pockets, hoping to find something that would help him, but there was nothing but phone, wallet, and keys.

Sensing Frank's dismay, Rash stepped back and gave him a long, appraising look. His lips were pursed, but his tongue stuck out just a little, giving him the look of an artist observing his canvas.

""Yes,"" he muttered to himself, ""yes, I have just the thing.""

Confused, Frank asked, ""Do you work here?"" but there was no reply—Rash was already sashaying his way through the many suits, walking gracefully with his hand outstretched, touching each piece of clothing with a single finger. Until abruptly he stopped and swiftly yoinked the suit from the rack and snaked his way back to Frank in his enchanting way.

Frank was at a complete loss for what to say. He wanted to hate this small, handsome man so badly, but for some reason he could not bring himself to. Something about him was so provocative. It was as if there was an impending, unforeseen disaster just on the horizon, but Frank was just too curious to see what it might do to put a stop to it.

Shoving the suit into his hands, Rash then patted him on the shoulder and pointed to the dressing room. Frank paused for a moment, still taken aback by the last two minutes, but was then shaken from his stupor by another gentle caress from Rash.

""My friend, aren't you going to try it on?""

Frank nodded and began walking to the dressing room. When he was inside, he found himself wishing he could still smell Rash's heady scent over the must of the dressing room. Quickly, Frank undressed and put the suit on.

Taking a moment to look himself up and down in the mirror, Frank could not believe what he saw. He looked absolutely dashing. Head to toe, the suit was a perfect fit. It was almost supernatural—he didn't think he could get something to look this good on him even if he had paid to have it tailored. In all his life he didn't think he could recollect a time when he had felt this suave and svelte. Even with just a T-shirt on and some socks, he felt like Errol Flynn. Frank was reborn in that moment, baptized in the fires of newfound confidence. He emerged a phoenix from the ashes as he stepped out of that dressing room.

Rash whooped and whistled, even clapping and jumping up and down like a cartoon man seeing a beautiful woman. ""Yes, yes, yes!"" he said. ""I knew you would look great.""

Frank reached out and shook his hand, smiling, thinking of tonight, thanking him for showing him the suit. Rash then produced a small tube from his back pocket and said, ""Wear this tonight too."" The image on the tube appeared to be a man slicking his hair back, and the rest was in Japanese. Looking up from the tube, Rash was pantomiming slicking-back motions on his head, making whooshing sounds and nodding, raising his eyebrows up and down really fast. Frank took the pomade.

Rash then led him through the rest of the store, and Frank deferred to him at every decision like a wise and guiding shaman on what had become Frank's proverbial hero's journey. Soon Frank was at the checkout with the suit, new boots, a belt to match, and a tie to pull it all together.

Rash invited him to his house as they were walking out of the store, but Frank was much too excited to get home and get ready to even consider the notion or its implications.

Once at home, Frank paraded around his house in his new attire and freshly slicked-back hair. He felt like Miami Vice, baby—he felt like that one guy from that one movie he had seen on TV once where all the girls love him and he fights those Russian guys. He stopped in front of each and every reflective surface to gander at himself. He was a showstopper from each and every angle.

Finally, the time arrived. Frank walked his fancy ass down to the bus stop and waited about ten minutes for the bus to arrive. In that time, he'd shot a glance to a middle-aged woman who was sharing the bench with him. He knew she was impressed with him and his suit. She nodded and said hello, then asked him where he was heading, looking at and acknowledging his suit. She wanted him so bad he couldn't even believe it. He looked to see if she had a ring on, because if she did, he would have totally ripped into her for not being faithful. Good thing she didn't. He told her he was going to a fancy party in Oak Heights. She nodded approvingly and said, ""Wow, moving up in the world, I see."" Yes, he was.

On the bus, he glared at a couple because their baby was crying too loudly, and they immediately set to work hushing it up. What was this new power he possessed? This suit worked miracles. Even Darlene the bus driver had paid him a compliment as he got on. ""Cool suit,"" she had said. It was the first time she had even spoken to him, and he could see the lust in her eyes as she had said it. He smiled to himself as he caught another old man gawking at him. ""Even these accursed homosexuals want me,"" he thought. ""Holy shit,"" Frank murmured under his breath, ""this is going to be one hell of a party.""

Frank entered the party. In his mind's eye he was a gallant knight riding a beautiful white steed into the hall of the king who was to offer a daughter of his to him in thanks for his services. He strolled in between partygoers, lifting a glass of champagne from the tray of a passing member of the wait staff. The waiter started to say something about, ""Sir, that's for...!"" But Frank was already on his way. He spied his boss Joshua and his wife. They made eye contact, and Joshua, getting his wife's attention, pointed across the room to Frank, and they both, gesturing to his suit, gave him a thumbs up. It looked like that promotion was a lock. About to stroll over to them, something out of the corner of his eye caught his attention. A glimmer of silk in the light of the chandelier. Passing on his left was a woman in a most revealing dress. He already had begun cursing her indecency in his head when she turned around and caught his eye. Frozen, Frank had been caught staring at her walking away. He was obviously only looking on in disgust at her immodesty, but she would never understand that. But then, to his surprise, she waved at him, beckoning him to follow her. Feeling that he was surely going to have to explain himself, he followed, preparing his reprimands and explanation. She led him to a standing table at the far side of the room, reached out her hand, and said, ""I love your suit. And the slicked-back hair is really cool—you remind me of that one guy from that one movie where the girls love him and he fights those Russian guys.""

Frank swallowed his opening statement he had been preparing. The cut of her dress was far too low for his liking and was obviously meant to be distracting. He was going to have to tell her. He opened his mouth to speak, but she started first. Then she said, ""Oh, sorry, were you going to say something?"" He shook his head no. ""Anyways,"" she started, ""do you know that movie I'm talking about?""

""Oh, yes, I've seen it. I quite like that one. Are you a fan of cinema?""

""Oh, not really,"" she said. ""I just saw that on TV once. Are you?"" She beamed up at him, batting her eyes as she asked, talking in a soft and inviting tone.

Frank scoffed and nodded, saying, ""Ohhh, ya, I've seen just about everything.""

""Wow,"" she said, ""that's awesome. What's your favorite?""

What a question! And where to start! Maybe she wasn't so bad after all—perhaps he could overlook the dress if her intellect was not found wanting as he had suspected upon first glance.

Frank began by telling her about the French New Wave and Jean-Luc Godard. She was a great audience, nodding and asking lots of follow-up questions. Frank's heart was pounding by the time he explained that Rolling Stones singer, Mick Jagger—he paused to ask and make sure she knew who that was. She didn't, so thank goodness he asked or that would have been confusing. Anyways, Mick Jagger was actually a big fan of Jean-Luc Godard and had him direct a concert movie of theirs.

""Wow, that's amazing!"" She reached out and touched his arm. Then she pulled him closer by his suit sleeve and whispered in his ear, ""Why don't we go somewhere more private and you can tell me about The 400 Blows?"" Then she winked.

Frank could not believe the powers he now possessed—never in his life had a conversation gone this well with a beautiful woman. Girls were usually too dumb to want to talk about the finer points of motion pictures with him, but here he may have found a future true cinephile like himself.

His face was so hot for some reason. His heart was pounding in his ears. He collected himself and offered his arm like a true gentleman, just like his mother had taught him. She led the way. Frank had abandoned all sense of decency, and his mind ran rampant with nasty lustful thoughts, thoughts he had a feeling may just come to fruition. He smiled to himself as they walked. How he must look to the plebeians in the crowd.

She led him down a hallway and then up some stairs out onto a balcony. They walked out over to the railing and looked out over the city. Wow, this was so romantic. Frank looked at her expectantly, hoping she would make the first move. A soft breeze whipped her hair, and she looked up at him. ""I'm so cold,"" she said. Frank went to take off his jacket, but then she threw herself into his arms and looked up at him. ""Much better,"" she said. Frank held himself in the pose of a robot, arms at ninety-degree angles around her, keeping her just a few inches away so as to not offend her with his current state. At this point in time, Frank could barely see straight—his thoughts, he felt, were that of a maniacal villain. ""Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy,"" he thought! Could it be! Could it really be! He would do anything for this night to go the way he thought it would. He stared down at her, fire blazing in his eyes, and he thought he saw a spark in hers too. She leaned in, and they began to kiss. Frank abandoned his robot pose and pressed their bodies together in an awkward smush. But this bliss was short-lived. She pulled away and began to sob, leaning over the railing, weeping. Frank reached out an arm, confused and so frightened that this was going to be the end of the night.

""I'm so sorry,"" she sobbed. ""I want to—I really want to, you know, do it with you... it's, it's just—"" She let out a great big sob. Frank, not knowing what to do at all, stood there with his hands out but in a forward way, like a mummy.

""What's the matter?"" he asked stupidly.

""Well, it's, it's... it's that I'm married!"" She sobbed.

Frank was aghast—had he really just kissed a married woman? But then she continued on.

""He's horrible, and he beats me, and he's becoming a Satanist, I think!""

""Oh my,"" said Frank, ""that's dreadful."" It wasn't so bad then if the man was a Satanist. She would need to legalize a divorce, but it sounded like they were practically already separated.

""I really would do it with you—I just don't want it to be a sin,"" she said, and looked up at him, tears in her eyes, and cast herself back into his arms like a stage drama.

Frank was at a loss. He wanted it so bad. He began to speak, but she started first.

""Maybe we could if he was gone, you know? Maybe if there was a way to get rid of him tonight, we could be together? He's actually just in the room to the left of us, probably doing some sort of occult ritual. It's honestly best if we actually stop him, I think."" She reached into her purse and produced a pistol. ""I think we really need to stop him."" She started kissing him again.

Frank was unable to think.

She pressed the gun into his hands. ""Please, we have to stop him, and then it won't be a sin when we, you know... do it."" By this time she had stopped crying and had taken on a very reasonable disposition.

""I would do it, but it's just that there are these fancy sensors that shoot satanic lasers when an unclean woman walks into that specific room. Only a man who is pure of heart can go in and stop him. I can't go because of all the unclean thoughts I'm having about you."" She touched his chest and tore her hand away as though burned. ""Even now I am tormented,"" she said.

Frank was exhilarated at the thought of her thinking those same nasty, dirty thoughts about him. He looked down and found himself clutching the revolver she had pulled out of her purse.

Very little or essentially no thought went into the decision. She had informed Frank that if he just went out the door they had come out of and hooked a right, he would just need to go into the first door on the left and would find her occult husband busy at sacrificing lambs or even babies in the room there. She also told him that in his pocket was a small white rock that was her lucky rock that her mother had given her and that she really also wanted that back.

Frank now found himself outside the door. Should he knock? What would he say? Better to take the enemy unawares, he thought, and turning the knob, pushed the door open. As soon as he opened the door, a green light flashed into his eyes, and soon he realized he was being scanned from head to toe. Upon completion of the scan, a robotic voice beeped out, ""Anunnaki not detected."" Must be a satanic word for the impure, he thought. To his left was a sitting area with a couch and a coffee table. A cigarette was still smoking in the ashtray. ""This bastard even smokes,"" Frank thought. She could get sick from so many diseases that were caused by secondhand smoke. All the more reason to set her free. Looking to the right, Frank saw a satanic altar disguised as what looked to be a scientific lab of some kind. Tubes and beakers and all types of shit were all over. Burners and that thing that washes chemicals out of your eyes was there too. There he was at the back of the lab, working under a bright light—a man in a white rubber suit with a mask covering his mouth and nose. He was so focused he must not have noticed Frank come in. He worked furiously under the bright light, tearing apart what Frank saw to his horror was some kind of anthropomorphic lizard. She wasn't kidding—this guy really was a Satanist, and now Frank realized it was all meant to be. Rash, the suit, meeting the girl, and the powers that the suit gave him. All so he could be God's righteous warrior. Filled with a new gusto primarily built upon his righteous indignation, Frank crept forward, gun pointed down as he had learned in Boy Scouts. He snuck around the side table so that he might be able to come up from behind and shoot him while he wasn't looking. To Frank's delight, the Satanist husband of his soon-to-be lover was wearing small corded headphones and was listening to Third Eye Blind's hit track from their self-titled album, ""Graduate."" Frank crept up behind him without him even noticing and blew his brains out. Blood and chunks of brain matter sprayed all over the lizard man as the dead man collapsed, hitting the table before his headless corpse slumped to the floor. Pieces of gore actually got into Frank's mouth, and he immediately threw up. Crying in disbelief, he started to run out of the room but remembered his lover's secret rock and ran back to ransack the corpse of the man he had just murdered. With the rock in hand, he managed to swallow the second round in his throat back down and run out of the room. Upon throwing open the door to the balcony, Frank saw Rash and his lady furiously making out. The woman was a head taller than Rash, and she held him like a koala in a tree. His legs were wrapped around her tightly as he humped her like a rabbit suspended off the ground.

Frank made a bewildered sort of animal shout, and Rash dismounted from the woman. They both turned to him and started laughing, speaking to each other in Akkadian, pointing and laughing over and over. They started making out again. Frank, in an absolute animal state, pointed the gun at both of them and fired. Without even looking at him, the woman raised a hand and generated a force field which stopped the bullets. Frank fired till the gun clicked empty. He slumped to his knees, and the gun and rock fell from his hands. Rash walked over and picked up the rock and, speaking a few words of Akkadian to it, threw it over the balcony. In a few moments their spaceship floated next to the balcony. A door on it opened, and stairs extended down over the railing of the balcony just a few inches from the ground.

Rash climbed up the stairs, and the woman followed after him, laughing at something he had just said. Rash turned down a walkway, disappearing from view. The woman turned to Frank just before she entered the ship and pressed a button on the railing of the ship, emitting a strange high-pitched sound. Frank's head exploded, ruining his suit completely.

Honestly, I find it pretty hard. After around 12-1 pm my focus drops a lot. My hours aren’t reduced and I often have afternoon meetings, so by then I’m tired and low-energy but still trying to look upbeat and engaged. I also don’t want people to think Ramadan makes me less productive. 😅 

Suhoor is tricky too :/  waking up breaks my sleep, but if I skip the suhoor coffee, I feel drained all day.

I also really miss being in Tunisia during Ramadan, where everyone just gets it when you’re a bit tired or slow.

1r79sx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1r79sx3/why_loving_an_introvert_might_be_the_smartest/,Why Loving an INTROVERT Might Be the Smartest Relationship Move (Science-Backed),"Been researching relationship psychology for months now (books, podcasts, research papers, the works) and honestly? The data on introvert partnerships is wild. Society pushes this extrovert ideal so hard that we've basically gaslit ourselves into thinking quiet = boring or antisocial = damaged. But here's the thing, after diving into attachment theory, communication studies, and interviewing actual couples, I realized introverts bring something to relationships that's genuinely rare. This isn't about one personality type being ""better"" it's about understanding what makes certain connections work so damn well.



\*\*Deep conversations come naturally.\*\* Small talk drains introverts but meaningful dialogue energizes them. Dr. Laurie Helgoe's research in ""Introvert Power"" shows introverts process information more thoroughly in their prefrontal cortex, which means they're literally wired for depth over breadth. You know those 2am conversations where you discuss everything from childhood fears to what happens after death? That's their comfort zone. They're not killing time with surface level BS, they want to understand who you actually are. Reading Helgoe's book completely shifted how I saw communication styles. She's got a PhD in psychology and spent years studying introversion, this woman knows her stuff. The book breaks down why introverts think differently and it's genuinely fascinating.



\*\*They're incredibly observant.\*\* Because introverts spend more time watching than performing, they notice things others miss. Your mood shifts, the specific way you like your coffee, that story you mentioned once three months ago. ""Quiet"" by Susan Cain talks about how introverts excel at reading social cues and picking up on emotional subtleties. It's not magic, it's just that they're not too busy broadcasting to receive. Cain's book became a massive bestseller for good reason, she draws on neuroscience and psychology to explain why our culture undervalues introversion. Honestly one of the most validating reads if you've ever felt misunderstood for being quiet.



\*\*Independence isn't threatening, it's expected.\*\* Introverts need alone time to recharge, which means they genuinely understand when you need space too. There's less of that clingy anxiety because solitude isn't abandonment, it's maintenance. This creates healthier boundaries naturally. The Attachment Project (website/resource) has amazing content on secure attachment styles, and spoiler alert, respecting autonomy while maintaining connection is literally the foundation of secure relationships. They've got articles, quizzes, and research backed tools for understanding your attachment patterns.



\*\*Loyalty runs deep.\*\* Introverts are selective about who they let into their inner circle, so if you're in, you're really in. They don't collect surface level friendships or need constant social validation. Research from evolutionary psychology suggests introverts form fewer but significantly stronger bonds. When an introvert commits, they're not one foot out the door scanning for upgrades. They've already done the mental work of deciding you're worth their limited social energy.



\*\*They're amazing listeners.\*\* Not the nodding along while planning what to say next type of listening, actual active listening. Introverts process internally, so they absorb what you're saying without the compulsion to immediately react or fix it. The podcast ""The Art of Charm"" did an entire series on communication skills and repeatedly emphasized that introverts naturally excel at the ""listening to understand vs listening to respond"" thing most people have to consciously learn.



BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content based on what you want to learn. Built by Columbia University alumni and AI experts from Google, it generates adaptive learning plans tailored to your goals and struggles.



The app lets you customize everything, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives packed with examples. You can also pick voices that match your mood, whether that's something calm and soothing or more energetic to keep you engaged during a commute. There's a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with about specific challenges, and it recommends content that fits your learning style. It's been helpful for understanding relationship psychology patterns and communication strategies without having to hunt down every book separately.



\*\*Comfortable silence exists.\*\* You can just be together without performing or filling every gap with noise. Sitting in the same room doing separate things feels intimate, not awkward. This might sound small but it's actually huge for long term compatibility. When the honeymoon phase fades and you're just existing in shared space, that comfort becomes everything.



\*\*Thoughtfulness over grand gestures.\*\* Introverts show love through considered actions rather than performative displays. They remember what matters to you because they actually paid attention. Less about expensive surprises, more about the book they saw that reminded them of your favorite author or planning a quiet evening because they know you've been overwhelmed.



\*\*Lower tolerance for drama.\*\* Introverts generally hate conflict for conflict's sake and unnecessary chaos. They're not going to blow up your phone, start fights in public, or thrive on emotional volatility. Dating can feel calm instead of like a constant rollercoaster. Obviously healthy conflict resolution matters, but there's something peaceful about being with someone who doesn't manufacture problems for entertainment.



The biological and social factors shaping how introverts operate in relationships aren't flaws, they're just different operating systems. Neither introversion nor extroversion is superior, but understanding these patterns helps you appreciate what you're actually getting. If you want depth, loyalty, and someone who treats your inner world with genuine curiosity, loving an introvert makes perfect sense.

I took the first sip of my coffee.

While gazing at the breathtaking view of the snowy mountains,

the warmth of the sun started making me feel lazy.

I was like, I need to sleep.

A few minutes later, I actually fell asleep.

Then my phone notification went off.

I had received an email from a business owner
who was showing me a faster way to achieve success.

After reading a few good emails, I deleted them and went to clear my trash.

Suddenly, I saw 357 emails in my spam folder.

What the heck is this?

I opened one of the emails — the content was actually amazing.

I even read it twice.

And I thought,

this business owner has no idea his emails are landing in spam.

When I asked him about his open rates, he told me that for the past few weeks, they’d been dropping day by day.

When I checked his settings, I found that his DNS records weren’t set up properly.

He didn’t even have a one-click unsubscribe button.

His SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records were broken.

His domain reputation was completely messed up.

After running a few tests,

he finally started getting better open rates
and is now making 3x more revenue compared to when his system was broken.

If you are facing the same problem or need  help with spam or promotions issues.

I’d love to give you a free audit of everything related to your email deliverability.

A little back story.. 
Im 20 years old, came to Dubai from India on a tourist/visit visa, I came here in hopes of getting or finding a job. 

I was promised by someone i had spoken to ON FACEBOOK for a painters job, not my field ofcourse but I just needed to leave India as i was raised in Oman and dont know anything about India, my family isuin Oman but i have lost contact with them as they didnt wanttme to work, but while i was 16 I got a job and wanted to work and slowly started an artificial jewelry business that was doing great, due to my family's anger they cancelled my visa and told me to ""do everything on my own"" So I was deported to a country that I had never visited before ""india"" As my father is from India, mother fromiindonesia, I had savings of about 10,000 AED which i used to apply for a freelance 2 year visa to Dubai since I should be over 21+ if i wanted my own visa in Oman, I spent over 6500 AED for a freelance visa which later found out that i had been scammed and the person who took the money blocked me. 

He sent me a fake visa and with that i had already booked my ticket and was in the airport, too late to turn back whilst in the airport itself I applied for a 1 monthDubaiV urgent visa and postponed my flight to a day later as i was promised visa in 24 hour, i started researching all over facebook since Facebook groups is how i used to get jobs in oman, i connected with someone who promised me a painters job and he was Providing accommodation plus food, i agreed though salary was 900 AED and 12 hour work, but he said if i can learn the work fast he'd even give me the 2 year visa. 

After staying in the airport for 24 hours as before i was staying in a lodge or bedspace in mumbai which i had already checked out of I finally  got my visit visa approved, i flew the same day and landed in Abu Dhabi airport, from where i took a shuttle bus of etihad airways to Dubai, a whole new place for me, whole new experience and i had only 1250 AED to sustain myself for the month. 

I directly spoke with the painter job guy on whatsapp and he sent me a location to go to, apparently accomodation was there and he said work will start in 2 days, I went there and saw 16 PEOPLE in one room, it shocked me, people were smoking in the room, drinking in the room and what not, i was traumatized, but i have to stay becauss i dont have alot of money, i dont know about bedspace system or partition system, nothing. 

I stayed there for 3 days and during that time j used to go out in the morning and wander in the malls try to give out my CV here and there and come back in the evening to night to sleep because of the amount of people and cigarettes and all i couldnt bear it. 

The 4th day i was woken up by someone in the room and was forced to rush to a car with a few more guys and go for work, upon reaching the work i realized its not the same ""painting job"" I signed up for we were at the world trade center and we needed to pick up heavy bricks and basically clean up the event, i texted the guy who brought me to that room and me told me that its not his work but someone elses who is probably staying in my room and i should probably get paid 60-80 AED the same night. 

But after the work they told me that yes its not his work its their own like a daily basis job (diyadi) or something and that they would pay me, but they didnt pay, 2 days more of no painting job and the guy also stopped replying to me, again they made me go to another job, i refused as i wanted payment but they said if you dont go then pack your things and leave, i had no place to go to, thats why i stayed and went for the work, again as usual they didnt pay me, that night i was researching about mobile phones on dubizzle and figured i have 1000 AED something i should just buy and sell phones, i spoke with a seller and negotiated a good phone, to pick up the next day, I had gone to sleep and the next day i wake up and i couldnt find my wallet, i searched everywhere and finally found it near the toiler with NO MONEY. ALL STOLEN. I was so heartbroken i didnt know what to do as the room had 16 people and no camera, i tried to ask everyone but no one knew anything. 

Then the same evening the electricity went out and we all were forced to sit in a car for a job, but still no payment, we were brought to abu dhabi where we were forced to work for  23 hours straight picking up heavy wooden furniture and assisting in assembling them. 

After that when we came back there was nk electriciry still and the person in charge who was bringing us to jobs told us he will do somethinh about the electriciry but did nothing and we had to sleep without ac or anything. 

Then all of a sudden after getting just 3 hours of sleep at around 6-7 am in the morning we were forced to evacuate the room becauss they apparently hadnt paid rent. 

The one who was incharge had a cousin who always wanted to talk to me, this guy told me he knows another place where we will get job and theyll pay in evening, we went their this was in hor al anz, we worked for a week, but no payment, i was forced to work becauss if i didnt then i wouldnt be able to have an accomodation, after a week one night while i was trying to sleep this ""cousin"" Who brought me there started touching me inappropriately, as we had to sleep on on bed both of us because there was no space for 2, at night he started trying to touch me and rubbing his ehm against me. I stayed quiet and just stood up and went to toilet, after that i never slept at night only 1-2 hours while we're at some site for work. 

Apparently this cousin has an elder brother whos an alcoholic and plays betting every night, this brothee of his was eating our money, because he was older thus cousin allowed it also, i found this out from the management of that bedspace or labour accomodation who gives us work. 

Now i explain clearly to this cousin that im not here for games i have about 5-10 days until my visa expires i need to go back or get a visa, he promised me he'd either pay to extend my visa or he would find a job for me as he has got contacts. But a day or 2 later cousin has a fight with his brother and his brother slaps ME???? and tells both of us to leave, i kept quiet as i dont want any scene and left, he came with me as well, now im homeless and broke, but this cousin says no issues hes got someone who will give us a place, we go there and again only 1 bed, this was in bur dubai, no work just accomodation, he feeds me lies big dreams that he'll get me a job in hotel management and i can work in burj al arab with good salary etc because i know english, but then again he tried to ehm yk 'touch' me, thats when i had haf enough and asked him not to as im not like that and i need a job i had about 5 days pending, he promised me that theres a job with good pay per day lets go there from tomorrow, we went at 12am at NIGHT to the job and i find out that its 'selling alcohol' illegally, there was this whole operation for that, and i refused, im a muslim, i would never, he was a muslim as well but then...idk, anyways, he forced me and pushed me, he wasnt taking no for an answer, so finally i told him ill only do like standing far, he told me to take a cycle and use it to transport the bottles, i agreed but as soon as i got that cycle i cycled back to the accomodation, took my things and ditched the cycle there and ran back to hor al anz, spoke with the same guy who gave us work earlier and told him to ONLY pay me becauss i neeeded to make the money for my ticket. 

I work there for about a week, but the issue is is that the money i was getting 60 AED and 10 minus for the bedspace means 50 AED PER DAY, which i eventually went into overstay, then this cousin guy returned and he tried to get close to me again which i refused and set a boundary after that a new guy came for the same work but this guy knew english, ill name him A so A seemed like a good educated guy, family was in Dubai just going through a small downfall, i became friends with A my first actual friend in dubai, or.... I thought, until thus happened. 

One day A told me i had cash and wanted to check my wallet (as a friend) to go and eat out which I denied that i had cash as i save each and every penny for my visa, tho overstay seemed crazy to clear but not impossible, i had around 4-500 aed in savings, and it was in my bag with my passport and all, so he checked and found nothing, then he asked me to check his wallet which i refused but he insisted and there he had 1500 AED so i told him if he wanted to eat out then why not spend from his pocket since... He hasaalot, right? But he said hes only in dubai becauss he is here for giving driving lessons while earning a few bucks he actually stays in Sharjah, i was like okay, thats fine, fast forward a week or 5 days later i had a job interview in JBR, i didnt know how to get there but i have google maps right? So I go, this was 2nd december UAEs national day and i went there in the morning, after the interview i sort of just stayed because i read in the news that there were fireworks and i just wanted to be at some peace. 

Apparently after waiting for 8 hours or so the fireworks was cancelled, and everyone there was ledt in disappointment, i take the metro back at around 9-10 pm and accidentally fall asleep, waking up and last stop centerpoint and I realize its 1 am and no metro back, i didnt know how to get a taxi and saw that my phone js also dead, so i decided to follow the sign boards by walk on the main road that led to hor al anz, i was near the airport crossing the road when a police from the other side of the airport fence called me, i came to the fence and he asked me questions, why am i here at this time? Its illegal to cross the road that way, what am i doing so late at night like this? Where is my passport? Where js my visa? I explain that my passport is in my bag in my room and my visa is on my phone but its dead, i am on overtsay but im resolving my issues, during the time amnesty was going on but i wasnt eligible for amnesty as i came on october, so he called another police guy and they put me in the car and brought me to the police station in the airporr, got my phone charged and checked my passport and visa, then they let me go, they strictly told me to keep my passport with me at all times, so as soon as i reached my room i opened my bag only to find out that the lock is broken and my smaller bag is gone, which contained all my documents, passport and cash, i asked everyone in the morning but no one knew anything. 

No one admitted no one said anything, just we dont know, the guy A was getting close to the Cousin guy so we kind of drifted apart too so i didnt talk to him as much, i asked him as well byt he replied with dont accuse me. 

2 days later he claims that his 1500 AED is stolen, he checks with everyone but somehow he kept on telling me if i have it just give it back but i didnt have it, I didnt know myself who took it as i was at work for morning shift then night shift and both in sharjah and only after coming back he told me that his money was lost, a day or 2 passed and he had come on my bed to comb his hair as i only have a mirror, so as a joke i pushed him to the side to push him i pushed him from his waist which i felt passport type book feeling, i tried to check but he wouldnt budge, he kept saying its important document of his etc. I kept insisting but he just walked out quickly and i didnt know where he went and when he came back, that wasnt with him, the next morning i went to muraqqabat police station to file a complaint on him becauss i was sure he took it, maybe he suspected me, maybe it was cousin who told him to do so, so at the police station the police calls him and he lies to the police saying i took 5000 aed from him, to which the police told me to settle the matter with him. 

I was lost and made the decision to leave that accommodation, for the next 3 months or so i was homeless in the streets of deira, i was always around baniyas square, al rigga and union side, wandering around asking people for job, i didn't get a job, during the time i gave my luggage to a shopping center as ""baggage deposit"" Becauss i cant bring it with me everywhere and they refused to give it baack after 3 days and demanded 50 AED which i couldnt give, i slept on the streets in just one pair of clothes for about 3 months, i used to shower in the mosques and blew my entire visa savings on transport for interviews and food. 

After 3 months through Facebook after i shared my story someone said theyll help me figure out my visa, my passport and accommodation, and job, i was the happiest and thought that im the luckiest person alive. during the 3 months i tried to apply for a lost passport certificate again and again but it kept getting rejected due to ""techincal errors"" Or my passport detials wasnt found with immigration or something i tried through muraqqabat police station as well as online as well as qusais police. Nothing worked. Anyways that person comes and meets me, he spoke big things as if he was going to take over dubai, fed me with these big things, then told me that he has a canteen in sharjah al dhaid, told me to work there and he will do the visa and passport and he sells visas as well, at first when i got there there was no ac nothing, i worked and slept there jtself under the scorching sun but I wanted my visa and passport to be sorted so i struggled i had to make the sacrifice and its not like i wasnt homeless before. About 3- 4 months i worked there until the canteen was ready and AC was put and all but no sign of any earnings for me and no visa and no passport, i didnt care about the money i just wanted the passport and visa, but nothing? I spent 7 months or so in the same pair of clothes, and i couldn't do anything about it, after that through facebooo i again i was hired for a part time gig as a model for peets coffee in arabian ranches and theyd pay me 500 AED, i told this guy, let me name him N the guy who promised me visa and all, I told him about this and he said he'd drop me, this canteen was in a stadium 63 km from al nahda dubai, so i couldn't go myself of course now he comes and bring me to Dubai, where i had gone for the shoot, after the shoot i was to be paid 500 aed but through bank transfer and i didnt know anyone except this guy N so i requested him that if i receive the 500 through his bank can hw give me cash? He agreed to it, so i forwarded his bank details, for a month no cash was received and i didnt want to disturb him i didnt want him to think im doubting that he spent it or anything so i didnt ask, after a month i ask the sender and she says that she sent 2-3 days ago, i forward that message to him, and he was like ""oh that was yours? I thought it was from one of my client so i spent it, i dont have it now ill pay you when i get"" I was like just look after my passport and visa,its okay. 

Now after a few days the owner of that stadium comes to me and tells me that this guy N has been arrested due to ""fraud"" And im shook, no passport? No visa? And now hws arrested? And the owner kicks me out of there and tells me to take my things and leave as he's hiring someone else. I was so heartbroken but i had nothing to say. 

Next morning i was out and i again was homeless and broke in deira again as deira js the only place i knew, i spent my days just wandering here and there and trying to get a job, i became on absconding even, and was totally lost. 

Fast forward to 3-4 months ago, now I posted about my story again and someone offered me a bedspace, i stayed there for a month and during that time i saw a post where someone needed a model for content creation and i have been creating content in the past so i signed myself up for it and got it, it was a part time gig and they paid a little well, i was able to shift to al nahda sharjah as rent is cheaper here in bedspace and i even started mess food system with someone now i got 1-2 nore shoots after that and then yet again dry, people want to hire me but they want me to record myself and i didnt have an iphone anymore as i had to sell it while i was homeless, I had just a cheap android that camera doesnt work, i posted about this again on reddit seeing if maybe someone would help me out for any iphone so i can start getting gigs again, as many were waiting, someone finallu stepped forward and did they paid my pending rent of December and gave me an iphone 11, i started connecting with businesses again but yet again this wasnt going to sustain me, plus the new media license thing? Everyone asks about that, so i decide to look for jobs in contenr creation. Thats when finally i landed my first interview with a company, they liked me and my confidence and promised a job of content creator cum social media management in AD and that theyll test or train me for 3-4 days then theyll issue me the offer letter in which affer that theyll clear my fines and absconding as well.

This is like answered prayers and with a good company, plus they'll cut from my salary a percentage until they make all of their money back that they invested into me. 

Now the issue is:

1) I don't have money to go from al nahda to AD

2) i need to pay my pending rent. 

3) I need to pay for the mess pending payment as well. 

4) i was able to collect few things and clothes which i now need a suit case if im to take with me, which i dont have as well. 

What do i do? How do i resolve all of this? 

Im just lost and dont know what is to be done as this is my one and only chance of getting my visa status sorted and finally FINALLY having a job. 

P.s i received a call during my homeless time from the police and was told to come to muraqqabat police station to collect my passport so i have my passport but becauss of i was unable to pay for my bedspacr rent and mess i didnt want to lose it i gave my passport as collateral that ill collect it when i pay... And now i really need it and im just so lost... I need advice or like any charity place or somethinh idkkk im just so lost.. ",1,1771343674.0,UAE,0,1.0,False

I really want somewhere that has stuff going on right outside my door such as coffee shops, bars, restaurants, maybe a park, just energy. I don’t want to feel like I have to commute 20 minutes just to get to a normal gym or a decent café. I’ve heard Bed-Stuy has great pockets and also some not-so-great pockets, so would love honest POVs on specific areas/blocks.

I also briefly looked at East Williamsburg because in my head I thought I’d love it, but it felt kind of isolated? Not a ton right nearby and gyms were farther than I expected. Maybe I was in the wrong part.

Open to other neighborhoods too. Bushwick, Crown Heights, Fort Greene, Prospect Heights, etc. and manhattan but don’t want upper manhattan. Would love somewhere that feels like community and things happening. I currently live in lower east side with a roommate but she’s moving in with bf and I’m thinking I’ll want to be on my own!!

1r79q33,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit_lgbthelp/comments/1r79q33/help_me_18_understand_if_i_should_start_courting/,"Help me [18] understand if I should start courting my friend [19 F] again, if she has a boyfriend and we're both girls in a fairly homophobic country?","Hello everyone who is reading this, I apologize for possible mistakes in the text because English is not my main language and it was quite difficult for me to write.

We should probably start with the fact that my name is Anna, I am 18 years old, and it will be a story that lasts almost 5 years about how I felt romantic feelings for my friend (she is a girl too). Her name is Lexi. 

So, 5 years ago we met in a dating bot, I was 14, she was 15, we lived next to each other, but we couldn't meet because we had quite strict parents, so we just talked on the Internet, it was correspondence where we discussed common interests, but nothing special. At that time, another girl came to me, I told Lexi about it, and she was supportive, despite our rather homophobic country. After a while, problems began in our country, maybe you can guess where I'm from ahahah, so we started talking more in the style of ""how are you? Is everything okay?» And so time passed, we never met in life, and she wrote that she would go to another country, I was sad that we would probably never meet again, so our communication began to disappear a little, but after a while my family and I also went to another country (it is far from the one where Lexi was). We sometimes talked, but not much, more in waves, then we communicate constantly, then we are silent for months. 

But then, in the spring of 2023, we started talking much more, found the topic in common interests again, and then it turned out that we were returning home at the same time, I was very happy because we would finally be able to meet. I arrived a few days earlier, I was really looking forward to her, and then, when she was also at home, I started calling her for a walk, at first she refused all the time, but I realized that she was just worried, so I continued to insist, and she agreed. 

Our first meeting was so special, Lexi was so beautiful, so sweet and kind, and we seemed to immediately find a common language, the very moment I saw her I felt like my heart was pierced by Cupid's arrow. We walked almost every day, I realized that I began to like her during the correspondence, but in life it was even brighter, she was so caring, sweet to me, a little shy, but over time she got used to my touch on her hand or hugs, so I constantly began to hold hands when walking. It was a great time. But sometimes I was so sad that I can't kiss her, or hug her not as a friend. 

She went on a summer trip with her parents, and when she came back, she was like a different person, like closed, detached, I asked her a lot about it, but she said that everything was fine. At that moment, I had a theory that she also had feelings for me, but her family pressured her a little about the fact that she had to find herself a boyfriend, so after a long time with them she felt internal homophobia or something. So then our friendship changed a little, but we still went out a lot, and then I went to college, made new friends, and Lexi and I continued to hang out, but less than usual. At that moment, I realized that she was unlikely to ever feel the same for me as I do for her, but even if she likes me romantically, her internal homophobia is too strong. 

At that time I met my best friend, we won't give him a name, so just the best friend, but we were like soulmates, like we were born to meet, I told him a lot about Lexi, he supported me, he was also in a relationship at that moment, but over time we kind of felt something more, and I started to think that my feelings for Lexi had disappeared. We didn't succeed with my best friend, because we realized that we love each other only as friends, with platonic love.

But it didn't change anything, and a few months later he helped me a lot when my grandmother died (it was very difficult for me, she was the best person in my family), so I realized that I wanted to be with him very often and very often, so it was, he became the world for me at that time. Lexi distanced herself, in fact it was very natural, and I didn't miss her much, at that time I had financial problems, she said that during our walks she could pay for everything until it got better, but I was so ashamed that I couldn't even buy myself a cup of coffee, so I stopped seeing her at all. 

Here comes a rather confusing part of my life, I don't remember exactly how everything happened, but I felt a very strong pressure from the people around me, from studying, and Lexi kept inviting me to hang out, it was so annoying, I often refused her.

Well, a lot of time passed, it's already winter 2024, we're still like friends, but not close. I was glad that she got into university and found new people, because I no longer felt guilty for leaving her alone. So, on December 31st, my family is preparing New Year's dishes, and Lexi texts me, ""You're the first person I'm telling, but I have a boyfriend.""

I was so angry and disappointed, like, girl, I tried so hard to get your attention, your best friend saw that there were feelings between us, EVERYONE saw it I think, but you couldn't say anything to me, and then, fuck, some guy appeared, it was enough for him to just be nice to you for a little while, give you flowers, and now you're dating. I replied to her quite aggressively. She wrote to me that she hopes we can reconnect in the new year, that she wants everything to be like before, but I was so hurt that I didn't respond to that. She invited me to hang out, but I kept refusing, and one day she asked me to explain my behavior and I told her quite rudely that we wouldn't be communicating (at that time I was so tired of her, plus I thought that rejecting the past would help me feel better, because it was such a shitty period of my life).

I felt so good for a few weeks, like she and all my problems were gone. And then I felt even worse, because my best friend (with him we had also started communicating less, but I thought everything was okay between us, we were just busy with our own stuff) turned out to be TRASH. He and I had a huge fight, and it hit me incredibly hard. I won't go into that topic, because it's a topic for the next post, but I felt so bad that I started therapy with a psychologist. A few months passed, I was getting better, things with my friend weren't so bad either, but I felt an emptiness inside. We're talking about spring 2025, and spring is a time I associate with Lexi, because that's when we first met. At that moment, I realized how much I truly missed her. So, after discussing it with my psychologist, I wrote to her, apologized, told her about the therapy, about how it wasn't her fault that I left her. She forgave me.

Then we started seeing each other, it wasn't often, but it was cool, I thought ""she's really a great friend, I want to be friends with her."" I started inviting her to various workshops and interesting events, after one of them she told me ""I'm here for you, call me, text me, I see that something is bothering you"" and when I got home I called her crying into the phone, telling her how sorry I was that I was a bad friend, that I left her, and other things. She said she wasn't angry and I felt that she truly forgave me.

She went on Christmas vacation with her family and boyfriend to another country, we texted each other, and it turned out we got sick at the same time, so I asked how she was feeling and stuff, it was sweet and like before.

And now it's 2026, she's back home, and says ""let's meet on Saturday"" I agreed, and then I realized it's Valentine's Day, so I asked if she was sure, and she said yes. I gave her a scarf and a Valentine's card. During the meeting, she complained about her boyfriend, that she was tired of him, and many other things, and I felt that damn, I still feel something, that maybe I never stopped having romantic feelings for her, and now I just want to be closer friends and maybe try to give her some signs of attention, but she still has a boyfriend.

And I received so many kind, positive, reassuring responses from you lovely women. Truly - thank you for letting this space be safe. I didn’t realise how much I needed that softness.

That post led to JustAnotherUser_555 DMing me.

Not even a casual “hi.”
She introduced herself properly. Told me about herself. Born in the Gulf. March baby. Lives in the same area as me. And just wanted to say hello. That’s it.

No agenda. No weirdness. Just… wholesome.
 
And then, I dropped the bomb to her, “Do you want to meet tomorrow?”

By night, we had exchanged IG accounts (just to confirm neither of us are serial killers 😭), loosely planned a time, kept the place tentative, and said we’ll decide once we meet.

Before sleeping, we were both ridiculously excited — like little girls making their first friend on the first day of school. We even exchanged numbers before bed because why not fully commit to the chaos.

Today, we met.

We went to this nice, cozy dessert place. Ordered a fake boba drink (why was it fake? we still don’t know 😭) and the most mediocre waffles known to mankind. 2/10 for the waffles. 10/10 for the company.

And we spoke. And we connected.

Despite the age difference. Despite being literal strangers 24 hours ago.

The energy matched. The vibe matched. It didn’t feel forced. It didn’t feel awkward. It felt easy.

She listened. She didn’t judge. She understood.

I already adore her a little bit.

And this is my gentle nudge to all of you — if someone in this sub lives near you and the vibe feels right, don’t wait for some big organised meetup. Take the leap. Meet for coffee. Go for a walk. You genuinely never know where it could lead.

I hope she felt the same way I did.

I've deleted the game for now, but I know when a new patch comes out, or a new promo drops that interest me, I'll load it back up. But this game makes me sad man. I've been playing since FIFA '94 on GameBoy. I have played and loved soccer my entire life, continuing on to have a cup of coffee in the USL (semi-pro) ranks. I still work in the sport, and I still love it deeply. As a part of that, FIFA has always been one of the things that brings me greatest joy within my love of the sport. I look forward to every release and have played each one religiously, regardless of quality.

  
I came to the realization recently that the game legitimately makes me sad. It makes me sad that I keep finding myself in the same cycle of initial enjoyment, shit gameplay, card hunting and (unfortunately spending points) then eventually hating that I spent money on a game I no longer want to play because of how frustrating it is. I genuinely do love the card collection aspect of the game, but when gameplay is palatable, that's \*really\* the only thing I care about. Playing against other humans and winning. I'm insanely competitive and FIFA is the one thing I've always been able to maintain through the years as a marker of ""I'm not old yet, I can still ball!"" However, when gameplay is as bad as its been, there's really no enjoyment to be had in the game, even in card collecting. I've got the best team I've had in years, and no desire to jump in a game with this squad. It genuinely makes me sad.

  
Sorry for the long-ass post, I just really wish we collectively had a better experience. ",2,1771343036.0,EAFC,0,1.0,False

1r79doq,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1r79doq/narcissistic_sister_in_law_affecting_my_marriage/,Narcissistic sister in law affecting my marriage,"My wife’s sister is a textbook narcissist. She is very similar to my wife’s mother however, the mom is more covert about it. 

My sister in law openly talks about how “good of a person she is”, she constantly tries to manipulate my wife into giving her money and paying for things, (we already pay her phone bill and are paying off her new phone and recently she tried to get my wife to give her money for a car), when my wife gives her a response that she doesn’t like, sister in law will scoff and talk down to her and be incredibly disrespectful. 

The two of them recently cut off their narcissistic mother and my sister in law (who is a college graduate) went to live with my wife’s god parents who have supported her for almost a year now. They’ve given her a home, paid for all of her wants and needs, they’re going to pay for an overseas trip for her, in a nutshell they are multi millionaires and have spoiled her for the last 10 months. 

Recently the god parents have been showing their house to potential buyers and my sister in law called my wife acting all upset and saying how “they are so selfish and don’t care about anyone but themselves” and absolutely dogging them because they’re selling “her home” and haven’t told her yet. 

Eventually all of it worked out because they have now moved her to an apartment in her city of choice, are paying her rent and bills for a year, and have furnished the apartment. Now all of a sudden they’re the greatest people on earth of course. 

\*\*\***here’s the huge kicker, sister in law has a job and is totally capable of paying my wife and I back for her expenses, but she spends her money on frivolous things she doesn’t need (like a treadmill or expensive coffee) and my wife gets upset when I point this out.**\*\*\*

These are simply just a FEW examples of her character but my biggest issue with her is how she talks down to my wife and is a major manipulator. 

That leads me to mine and my wife’s issues. I come from a very healthy and whole family. We have open communication and talk about when we have hurt each other and we always respect each others boundaries. My wife’s family is not like this at all. So when I point out this behavior from her sister and tell her that it’s not right and that I won’t tolerate it nor do I have any desire to be her sister’s friend, she gets upset with me. 

She knows that I dislike her sister and she tells me all my reasoning is completely valid and she trusts my opinions and my gut feeling. 

But whenever she brings up her sister or what’s going on in her life, she expects me to match her energy and excitement but all I simply have to offer is neutral, one word responses because at this point I genuinely have no love or patience left for her sister. If it were up to me we would cut her off because she is too toxic. 

It’s getting to the point to where we are starting couple’s counseling because it is causing a divide between us. 

I just want to protect my wife from any further toxicity, she has been abused, yes abused, by her family of narcissists for years and that stops now. I don’t want her to be taken advantage of any more, and I certainly don’t want her to be talked down to. It’s incredibly difficult for me to watch. 

Anyone with a situation remotely close to mine or anyone with any advice is much appreciated. Thank you. ",3,1771342923.0,inlaws,2,1.0,False

He started venting about his wife. It started pretty normal with just household chores stuff and feeling overwhelmed balancing labor (she goes in while he WFH). I tried to listen and just be supportive, good venting practice!

But then he got into the bedroom. He said that she has been complaining about their bedroom life, that they are only doing it about once or twice a month. She has said she’s dissatisfied. He said that that’s a normal amount for married couples. I said that it didn’t seem that low, but if she’s dissatisfied, he should take it seriously.

I then brought up porn because I know he watches it. He got defensive immediately and said it was “perfectly normal.” I have rather extreme views on porn which he has heard so I tried to tread carefully and just said, “well do you think watching porn might be impacting your drive for her?” 

He said that it wasn’t in any way. At this point, I thought he was being disingenuous and I admit I got a little frustrated and lawyer-y. I said, “Really? It’s your testimony that watching hardcore porn isn’t having any impact on your overall sex drive? That’s your testimony?”

He said I was being ridiculous and that I thought I was better than him because I didn’t watch porn. I told him the truth, which is that I don’t think I’m better than anyone, but I know that I would have less of a drive for any partner if I was consistently watching that stuff. 

He said it’s normal and I was the weird one, and that the reality of the situation was more complicated. He said I didn’t understand because I was single. I didn’t let him have the last word which might have been immature and said, “Yeah I guess the misogynistic propaganda is fine, no way that would affect your perfect life.” He scoffed and said plenty of his friends have great marriages and that normal men watch porn. 

At that point I asked him to pay me back for his latte and we kind of ended on an awkward note. I feel like he is abdicating responsibility and I am not being unreasonable here, but I have to admit, I only have one or two other guy friends who are off the hub. So maybe I have a blind spot for how normal and acceptable this is. AITA?

1r79bk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDerTips/comments/1r79bk7/stop_eating_the_frog_seriously_start_eating_the/,Stop eating the frog. Seriously. Start eating the ice cream instead,"I finally realized why I've been staring at the same IMPORTANT task for three days while my brain literally feels like it’s shutting down. We have all heard the classic productivity advice: ""Eat the frog"" do the hardest, ugliest thing first thing in the morning and the rest of your day will be a breeze.  

  

SPOILER ALTERT If I try to eat the frog first, I just spend six hours staring at the frog, feeling like a total failure, and then I end up on a Wikipedia deep dive about the history of the Apollo 11 moon landing (did you know they landed four miles off course? lol anyway, back to the point)

The problem isn't that we are lazy or unmotivated. It is that our brains don't actually care about (importance or consequences ;-;) in the same way neurotypical brains do. For us, trying harder isn't a solution. It is just more effective at making us feel like we are drowning (yep...)

The Motivation Flaw: Most productivity systems (like GTD or Inbox Zero) were built for neurotypical brains. They rely on a ""trust"" in your own brain that we just don't have yet. My brain doesn't care if a task is ""important."" It cares if it provides dopamine.

When we hit a point of overwhelm, our brains don't just ""power through."" They shut down. It feels like someone handed you a baby while you were already underwater. You can't breathe, and someone is tossing you more responsibilities.

The 4 C’s of ADHD Motivation: Instead of forcing the ""Frog,"" I’ve started looking for the Four C’s. This is how we actually get the engine moving:

Captivate: Is there a part of this project that is actually fascinating?

Create: Can I turn this boring task into a creative problem to solve?

Compete: Can I gamify this? (can I finish these five emails before the coffee finish brewing) got it??

Complete: Can I set a hard, urgent deadline that actually feels real!!

Strategies That Actually Work (For Now)

The biggest thing I've learned is to Embrace the Pivot. I used to feel so much shame when a new system or app stopped working after two weeks. Now, I just realize my brain is bored and needs novelty. That is okay. It didn't ""fail,"" it just finished its usefulness for that cycle.

A few things I’m trying this week: Eat the Ice Cream First: I do a task that I actually enjoy or find creative first. This builds the momentum. Once the ""train"" is moving, it is way easier to tackle the boring stuff.

Micro-Commitments: I’m not ""cleaning the kitchen."" I am putting exactly three dishes away. Usually, I do more, but if I only do three, I still ""won"" that goal.

Side Quests: If I'm stuck on a main project, I let myself take a ""side quest"" on a related, more interesting angle for 15 minutes. It sparks the brain back to life (mostly i like to keep a white sheet in the desk and write any sudden apperaance of those 1M dollars ideas lmaoo)

Stop blaming yourself for not being able to follow systems that weren't built for you. You aren't a broken neurotypical person, you just have an interest-based nervous system.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go finish those three dishes before I forget why I walked into the kitchen in the first place (';",1,1771342799.0,ADHDerTips,0,1.0,False

1r795w8,https://i.redd.it/n3mdqx7fq2kg1.jpeg,Fuckd up my INDORE Interview. Transcript,"Hey guys, so I had my second interview of the season today for IIM Indore at Faridabad. And even before the interview, I had messed it up. I did not prepare my HR questions thoroughly as most of my best call interviews are scheduled in March so I got laid back and I regretted it only then. Everything seemed highly competitive there. We were offered tea/ coffee and cookies in the waiting area. Below is my transcript of the interview:

Profile 87.4/88.33/64. Graduation in Bachelor of Physiotherapy. Fresher female. Passed out in August 2025. I was first to be called in.

Two panelists, both male.

I: Good morning sir, good morning sir (spoke to both)

P1: Good afternoon. (Realised it was 2 PM). So, tell me something about yourself that is not mentioned in your application form.

I: Went on to give my TMAY and added bits of information here and there that were not mentioned. Now reflecting back I should have mentioned my hobbies of singing and reading. But I went with structured TMAY approach about my curriculars only.

P1: So, you have studied anatomy? Tell me how would explain arteriolar and venous supply to a 14 yo.

I: Went on to explain by trying to picque interest by sharing how heart is the central pump of the body and how and why it needs to supply blood to tissues. Then explained the difference bw arteries and veins.

P1: (Interrupted) Tell me as a 14yo.

I: Took A4 paper and drew diagram of heart and still used technical language. Now, reflecting back I feel I should have switched to hinglish instead of pure english cause' could have been more creative in that.

P1: No, I think you should revisit that approach. The purpose was not to test your knowledge but approach toward 14 yo. I don't know if you know, but there is a relative grading system in IIM where you compete against stellar profiles from commerce and engineering backgrounds and there may be people who would be having much better knowledge about the domains you will be studying. How would you compete there?

I: Sir, that's a very fair point that you raised. In fact, even I thought that this point may raise question. I would like to tell you sir that this is not the first time that I would be competing with people from completely different backgrounds. In fact, in most of the internships that I pursued beyond healthcare domain, I had colleagues from different bgs, especially management. During my internship at OBL, a leadership and training org , I was the only intern out of the 5 selected who did not come from a mgmt bg. Also, since I come from a different background and with such high risk capital, I have all the more incentive and push to perform since I know I don't have an edge here. That would motivate me enough sir to perform. (Spoke more on this only)

P1: Why do you want to do MBA?

I: Tried explaining that I need formal structured training in management as through my internships in different domains during UG, I realised that I was equally interested in system level impact if not more than individual clinical session. I explained that I don't come from business family or netword and I need to build network for guidance also on my long term startup/ business project in physiotherapy domain.

P1: You can do that without 2 years of high risk capital investment as well. Why then?

I: Reiterated similar lines of thought as earlier.

P2: If you don't get roles in healthcare domain then what?

I: Tried to reason that in short term I need exposure and want to explore roles in domains such as gen mgmt or marketing in FMCG sector.

P2: Till when did you study maths?

I: Till 10th sir.

P2: Take a sheet of paper and draw the graph for this equation, y=5x+2

I: (Super simple linear equation, but couldn't draw neatly in first attempt and didn't plot multiple points)

P2: So, it passes through origin?

I: Randomly said yes sir.

P2: Tell me y intercept at x=0

I: Extrapolated the graph to see it did not pass through origin. Rectified myself excusing pressure of time on mind. Said, it doesn't pass through origin sir.

P2: Why don't you get some work experience before MBA? All your reasons are fine but why now?

I: (Messed this segment) Reiterated earlier thoughts on why MBA.

P2: Do you have any questions for us?

I: Yes sir, so I ask for your feedback on my direction. I ask for guidance as well. Actually, my reason for doing an MBA right now is this only that I want to train myself in managerial education. I believe MBA gives one a whole new perspective to things in life. And I also want to learn all the different aspects of a business. Building a network with similar inclination is also something I deeply value.

P2: See, every year about 10 to 12 people come to IIM from medical bg only, but what we have observed is that they face problems in securing placement. And this won't affect our selection criteria of you, the perspective you bring to the table is different but about the placements it may be a issue. And moreover, we feel right now you should get work experience first for 2 years and then think of MBA.

I: Tried to understand their perspective better and kept fishing for opportunity to express strongly why I was motivated for MBA.

P2: Alright, thankyou so much Nidhi. All the best. You may take a water bottle and toffee.

I: Looked through the flavours available.

P2: Take both. They are for you only.

I: (Picked one each) Thank you sir, thankyou sir (spoke to both individually).

I came out to hear from the next candidate that I took 30 mins and most other candidates in other panels were out in 15 mins max. Even she came out in 15 mins. (However, I am aware that it was because I spoke at length in all my answers and kept the discussion alive)

I believe I demonstrated good body language and soft skills but messed up my HR questions and other creative questions and even took more time than it takes for the linear eq question. Over all by the end of the interview, I got the vibe that the panel advised me to have work ex first. Now, I don't know what the verdict is gonna be, but I am more motivated for my next interviews now. My vercel predictor shoes I need 13-15 marks in PI for the convert for Indore.

I have chronic illnesses (POTS, MCAS and hEDS) which limit my physical energy and make overexertion cause significant health flare-ups.

I live with my mum in my nan’s house. My parents divorced in 2019 and we moved here together. In 2021 my nan moved to Spain and the tenancy is now in my mum’s name.

Before this house, my mum and I were extremely close. We had more of a best friend relationship, rather than a mother/daughter one. She went out, took care of herself, kept the house clean and we did everything together. Over the last 4 years she has completely changed.

She stays in her bedroom almost 24/7 either gaming or sleeping. She rarely comes downstairs, rarely cooks for herself, and relies on others to bring her food even though she physically can do so herself. She has had depression her whole life and suspected autism, but the situation has gotten beyond that. She openly says she doesn’t care about hygiene or “society’s standards” anymore and prefers living like this, that she is genuinely happy to live the way she does and wouldn’t want it any other way. She says the reason she no longer keep up with personal hygiene or maintenance of the household is because it’s boring and she’d much rather spend her time on her video games.

Because of this, the house becomes very dirty and I cannot keep up with it by myself.

• dirty dishes are left around in her bedroom and the kitchen for days with excess food and sauce dried and rotting to the sides of them

• sink and counters constantly filled with dirty dishes and rubbish so I can’t cook for myself or clean my own personally used dishes without cleaning her mess first

• coffee and food stains left in the carpets until they become permanent; she spills things and then can’t be bothered to clean it up so by the time I come across it, it has already penetrated deeply into the carpets. this leaves an awful smell in the house, and the brand new cream carpets 4 years ago are now covered in stains.

• if I don’t do it myself, the toilet and bathroom gets cleaned every 3-4 weeks but only if I repeatedly ask her to do so

• house smells awful due to buildup of mess/dirt which makes it so embarrassing when guests come over and I tend to avoid having friends over.

• she doesn’t shower, change her own bedding, or brush her teeth enough, leaving her once white bedsheets yellow.

When I deep clean and do everything for her in order to make the house feel more comfortable for myself to live in, the house is ruined again within 24–48 hours and all my efforts are wasted.

I physically cannot maintain the house due to my conditions, but if I stop cleaning, it becomes unliveable. If I ask her to help she becomes angry, raises her voice and says I’m overreacting, I’m “over-clean” and that I make her feel like it isn’t her house anymore with all my “nagging”.

I feel trapped because:

• I can’t afford to move out due to not having a job

• I feel guilty because I have a roof over my head and food so I feel I shouldn’t be so stressed and depressed with my living arrangements

• I miss my mum — it feels like she’s not the same person now, like I don’t even have a mum anymore

Family members have spoken to her many times and nothing changes. She is genuinely happy living this way.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do in this situation. Has anyone dealt with a parent who just refuses to function or maintain hygiene?

I am hoping to get a job soon which hopefully means I can move out within the next year or two but I really don’t know how to cope with it all for that long.

1r7949v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r7949v,A Six-Show Long Weekend,"I am so thankful to have spent the long weekend in my favorite city in the world, NYC! 2026 has been a really tough year for me so far - I had an unexpected and completely devastating heartbreak - so a weekend in NYC was just what the doctor ordered! Seeing Aaron Tveit (in sunglasses no less!) in all of the Chess ads around the city was the mood boost I needed! I have been feeling very sad and empty, and many days listening to musical theater songs are the only thing that put a smile on my face. I'll forever be grateful for musicals, plays, and ""My Manhattan"" (Daddy Long Legs reference 🙂). 

Show 1: Hamilton (Saturday Matinee).
- Seat: orchestra, row V, seat 21 ($233 via TodayTix). This was a good seat! It was labeled partial view, and it was - I usually couldn't see cast members' heads when they were on the elevated part of the stage that wraps around above the perimeter of the main stage (I am not sure what to call it). Since I am very familiar with the show, this obstruction didn't impact my enjoyment of the show at all. 
- Did the Theater Sell Coffee?: no.
- Rating: 10/10.
- Review: I just love Hamilton - a top three musical for me. This was my second time seeing it live (I also rated my first viewing a 10/10) and I have watched the proshot countless times. This performance was fantastic. Edred Utomi as Alexander Hamilton was outstanding! His mannerisms and breath control elevated his performance to another level. Alexander Hamilton is a very hard track, and Edred totally crushed it! A masterclass performance. Jin Ha as Aaron Burr was also a standout for me. Following Leslie Odom Jr. in his Tony-winning role is a tough ask, and Jin rose to the occasion and delivered an amazing performance. Jin's In The Room Where It Happens was riveting and honestly perfect. Thayne Jasperson was on as King George III and his take on the role was so fun! I absolutely loved his dancing during Reynolds Pamphlet!! It was really neat seeing someone else take on the role of Samuel Seabury, and Desmond Nunn did such a wonderful job! It was cool seeing the little changes he made to the role! Cherry Torres was a great Peggy Schuyler and Maria Reynolds! She truly transformed herself between the two different roles. I was very impressed! I would be remiss to review Hamilton and not mention the ensemble! They are truly Non Stop! It is insanely impressive! Hamilton never fails to make me cry, and this performance was no exception! That Would Be Enough hit extra hard, as did ""in their eyes I see you, Alexander. I see you every time"" (shout out to Morgan Anita Wood whose incredible performance of Eliza Hamilton made me cry at least four times!) Lin is genius and I will forever be in awe of him. 

Show 2: Oh, Mary! (Saturday Second Matinee).
- Seat: left balcony, row B, seat 19 ($77 via TodayTix). This seat was great! It was labeled partially obstructed, and maybe 2-3% of the show was obstructed. Not a big deal at all and nothing critical happened out of view! I would sit there again in a heartbeat.
- Did the Theater Sell Coffee?: no.
- Rating: 8.5/10.
- Review: this was my second time seeing Oh, Mary! The first was in July 2025. That time I rated it 7.75/10. Even though I really enjoyed Oh, Mary! the first time I saw it, this time the jokes hit even harder! I was in stiches. John Cameron Mitchell was fantastic!! Excellent comedic timing, acting, and line delivery! >!The end-of-show cabaret performance was perfect, as was Mary getting stuck on the desk haha!<! Simu was out and Julian Manjerico stepped in the role of Mary's Teacher. He was wonderful! Julian did an outstanding job and had great chemistry with John Cameron Mitchell. I love the Fiyero-esque pants + boots! Jenn Harris was an amazing Jane! She was absolutely hilarious and her embarrassment about >!the ice cream incident!< was very convincing haha! John-Andrew Morrison and Tony Macht were great as Mary's Husband and Mary's Husband's Assistant, respectively. I am so glad I revisited this show!

Show 3: Little Shop of Horrors (Saturday Evening).
- Seat: right orchestra, row A, seat 4 ($142.50 via Telecharge). This was a great seat! Sitting front row is so much fun and I was almost ""eaten"" by Audrey II (a dream come true!!) This seat is right by one of the on-stage staircases, and you are super close to almost every cast member at some point in the show!
- Did the Theater Sell Coffee?: no.
- Rating: 9/10.
- Review: I love LSOH! It was my third time seeing it performed lived and all three times I scored it around 9/10 (+/- 0.25). I listen to the Off-Broadway recording often! Joy Woods was a fantastic Audrey - she is a star (I thought that when I saw Gypsy and I thought it again at LSOH). The emotion (including tears!!) that she put into Somewhere That's Green was so impressive and breathtaking. Joy's take on Audrey was beautifully layered - a remarkable performance. Andrew Durand! I listen to the Shucked OBC often and I couldn't wait to hear Andrew's amazing voice live! Andrew was fantastic! He played Orin DDS very well, and he was hilarious as the handful of other characters he played. I had Now (It's Just the Gas) stuck in my head the rest of the evening! Andrew is truly captivating and I am so excited to see him in Rocky Horror Show (knowing that I will get to see / hear him sing Dammit Janet is everything I didn't know I needed until his casting was announced!) Joshua Basset was a great Seymour! I am a huge High School Musical fan (Go Wildcats!), so you can bet (on it) that I also love High School Musical the Musical the Series. I was thrilled to see Joshua take on the role of Seymour! Wow, his dancing was a standout for me! Joshua added so much silliness and boyish charm to the role that beautifully contrasted the dark storyline. His Feed Me was excellent (one of my favorite songs of the show!) He also pulled back the volume of his voice during Suddenly Seymour, and really let Joy shine in that moment (I cannot emphasize enough how amazing Joy is in this role!) - it was a lovely duet. Joshua was also very kind at stage door! Christine Wanda (Ronnette), Savannah Lee Birdsong (Crystal), and Morgan Ashley Bryant (Chiffon) were all fantastic - lovely harmonies! I look forward to venturing back to Skid Row next cast change!

Show 4: High Spirits (Sunday Matinee).
- Seat: mezzanine right, row J, seat 12 ($28 via the show's offical website). This was a fantastic seat. There is a section break right before this row, so there is no one directly in front of you. The balcony overhang didn't get in the way for this production either - I could see everything perfectly! What a steal at $28 too!
- Did the Theater Sell Coffee?: yes!! It was delicious! 🎉
- Rating: 8/10.
- Review: this was my first time seeing an Encores performance and my first time seeing a show at New York City Center (wow, what a beautiful building!) - I was so excited! What a cool experience! I had no familiarity with the show going in - I hadn't heard any of the songs before and I only vaguely knew what the show was about. Phillipa Soo was my main reason for buying a ticket! I absolutely love Doctor Odyssey (Joshua Jackson, omg 😍❤️‍🔥) and Hamilton, so seeing Phillipa live was a dream come true!! She was wonderful! I loved the accent she used for Ruth! Shout out to the costume department - all of Ruth's outfits were stunning. It was really fun seeing Phillipa interact with her husband on stage - they unsurprisingly had fantastic chemistry! Phillipa's singing was amazing - she has such a beautiful voice. Katrina Lenk was hilarious as Elvira - I love how she would fluctuate the tone of her voice. Katrina is an amazing singer as well! Jennifer Sanchez was also great! Truly a very strong cast all around! Most of the cast was still on book and carried around the script with them. Andrea Martin lost her place in the script at one point, and played it off very well by expertly turning it into a comedic moment! The orchestra was on stage, and wow! They were excellent. There was some actor interaction with the conductor too, which was cool! The book of this musical is very fun, and I really enjoyed the songs. I am glad I caught the last performance of this production of High Spirits. I would definitely see an Encores production again!

Show 5: Jane Eyre Concert (Sunday Evening)
- Seat: third tier, row DD, seat 129 ($127.50 via the show's offical website). This was a good seat! It is the last row in the highest balcony level, but I could still see everything very well. I wish the rake was a bit steeper, but it wasn't too big of an issue. I would sit there again.
- Did the Theater Sell Coffee?: yes 🙌! You can't bring it to your seat unless you put it in a plastic tumbler cup, but I had plenty of time to drink it from a coffee cup ahead of heading to my seat. 
- Rating: 10/10.
- Review: wow. It's hard to put into words how spectacular this concert was! I can't believe how much effort was put into a one-night performance! I love the story Jane Eyre, but I was not familiar with the musical. The songs are beautiful - I will definitely be frequenting the OBC recording now! It was sometimes a bit of a tough watch for me with my heartbreak, as I always felt like this one line from the Jane Eyre TV mini-series - ""I have always known myself. But he was the first to recognize me"" - perfectly encapsulated how I felt when were together. There were a lot of tears flowing during Brave Enough For Love, but I am so so glad I saw the concert. The orchestra was incredible! I love an onstage orchestra - it is always so amazing seeing so many experts of their craft all in one spot! There was also a very large choir, which sat behind the main stage throughout the show, and other choir members would go into the aisles during parts of the show. It was extremely powerful having 100+ choir members singing 360° around the theater. Their voices worked beautifully together and with that of the main cast. Erika Henningsen was phenomenal! She really had the Jane Eyre voice down - it was insane how well she encapsulated the character. I had seen Erika as Sandra Dee in Just in Time (where she was also fantastic), and it was very impressive how much she changed both her speaking and singing voice between the two roles. Hats off to Erika and her masterclass performance! Ramin! It was my second time seeing Ramin Karimloo perform - I was lucky enough to see him from front row as the Pirate King in Pirates! Ramin was a wonderful Rochester. Perfect casting - I can't think of anyone better for the role. His singing and acting were excellent. Ada Manie as Young Jane Eyre was insanely impressive. She had all of her lines down, did a great job acting, and had a beautiful singning voice. Clara Bishop was a great Adele. Her French accent was amazing! There were so many handsome guys in this concert - Ramin, Austin Scott, and the conductor Brad Haak are all very handsome!! Even though it was a concert, there were still a lot of speaking parts in the show and a decent amount of set pieces; both of which added to the show for me. At the risk of repeating myself, the amount of thought and effort that went into this concert was truly outstanding. The price of my ticket was well worth it.

Show 6: Lion King (Monday Matinee).
- Seat: mezzanine, row L, seat 131 ($95.90 via TodayTix). This is a great seat! Even though it is the last row, I could see everything perfectly and didn't feel too far away. I actually think a ""bird's eye view"" works very well for this show, as there is often lots to take in on the stage!
- Did the Theater Sell Coffee?: unfortunately, no. The sign / menu at the bar said they did, but they did not when I asked. They do have bottled Starbucks frapps, but I passed since I am a black coffee drinker. 
- Rating: 7.5/10.
- Review: some days have been extra hard for me, and this day was one of those days. I was feeling extremely low and there were lots of tears, which may have impacted my enjoyment of the show. I honestly hope this quote from Waiting for Gadot is true, as then I have been saving others from a lot of tears these past couple of months - ""The tears of the world are a constant quantity. For each one who begins to weep somewhere else another stops""! Anyways... back to Lion King. It was my first time seeing the show, but I am very familiar with the movie and I have also watched the Lion King Hollywood Bowl concert on Disney+. First off, the costumes - wow! The animal costumes were stunning. The talent to create these costumes and for cast members to operate them in a way that perfectly mirrors how that particular animal moves is incredible! There is so much talent at this production of Lion King. Ntsepa Pitjeng-Molebatsi as Rafiki was a standout for me. She was absolutely amazing and her singing is top notch. Any time Ntsepa was on stage, my eyes were drawn to her - she has a great stage presence! The Circle of Life was beautiful! I cried when baby Simba was lifted into the air (what a cute lion baby!!) I actually (quietly) sobbed most of the second act, particularly during Endless Night. What a beautiful song and Mduduzi Madela did a fantastic job singing it. 

I am very thankful for this trip to NYC! I'm counting down the days until I am back! Thank you to everyone that contributes to this subreddit!

Till now, I have only tried coffees from Blue Tokai and tbh I think I'm starting to appreciate a good cup of joe. Since, I'm just getting started I'm using the Channi method, as I want to see whether speciality coffee is my cup of ~~tea~~ coffee.

My brewing method is as follows:-

* Water at 90-92 degree Celsius
* \~2 tbsp of coffee for 120-150mL of water
* 3:1 coffee to milk ratio so \~40-50mL of milk
* I brew it for 3:30 mins then press the crust and leave it for another 4-5 mins before filtering it using Channi

Until now I have tried:

Attikan Estate - bought from Swiggy instamart so I got September 2025 roasted beans (I was a noob); Still it was good

13th B'day blend (bought from the website so got recently roasted beans; Initially it was surprisingly good but I was struggling to taste different notes w/ milk after a couple of days.

I want to try medium to dark roasts with milk but I'm open to good light roasts as well. I read that due to VC funding Blue Tokai's price has seen a hike and maybe quality has dropped. I'm running out of the B'day blend so I was thinking of buying a customised sampler pack from Blue Tokai with Dhak Blend, BasanKhan Estate and Amruthavarshini Estate.

Although considering the recent reviews I'm reluctant, shall I buy this particular sampler from BT or Would you recommend any other coffees from BT?

Would you suggest any other roasters apart from BT who deliver online?",2,1771342349.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

1r79219,https://i.redd.it/gua6gp9wd2kg1.jpeg,Fuckd up my INDORE Interview. Transcript,"Hey guys, so I had my second interview of the season today for IIM Indore at Faridabad. And even before the interview, I had messed it up. I did not prepare my HR questions thoroughly as most of my best call interviews are scheduled in March so I got laid back and I regretted it only then. Everything seemed highly competitive there. We were offered tea/ coffee and cookies in the waiting area. Below is my transcript of the interview:

Profile 87.4/88.33/64. Graduation in Bachelor of Physiotherapy. Fresher female. Passed out in August 2025. I was first to be called in.

Two panelists, both male.

I: Good morning sir, good morning sir (spoke to both)

P1: Good afternoon. (Realised it was 2 PM). So, tell me something about yourself that is not mentioned in your application form.

I: Went on to give my TMAY and added bits of information here and there that were not mentioned. Now reflecting back I should have mentioned my hobbies of singing and reading. But I went with structured TMAY approach about my curriculars only.

P1: So, you have studied anatomy? Tell me how would explain arteriolar and venous supply to a 14 yo.

I: Went on to explain by trying to picque interest by sharing how heart is the central pump of the body and how and why it needs to supply blood to tissues. Then explained the difference bw arteries and veins.

P1: (Interrupted) Tell me as a 14yo.

I: Took A4 paper and drew diagram of heart and still used technical language. Now, reflecting back I feel I should have switched to hinglish instead of pure english cause' could have been more creative in that.

P1: No, I think you should revisit that approach. The purpose was not to test your knowledge but approach toward 14 yo. I don't know if you know, but there is a relative grading system in IIM where you compete against stellar profiles from commerce and engineering backgrounds and there may be people who would be having much better knowledge about the domains you will be studying. How would you compete there?

I: Sir, that's a very fair point that you raised. In fact, even I thought that this point may raise question. I would like to tell you sir that this is not the first time that I would be competing with people from completely different backgrounds. In fact, in most of the internships that I pursued beyond healthcare domain, I had colleagues from different bgs, especially management. During my internship at OBL, a leadership and training org , I was the only intern out of the 5 selected who did not come from a mgmt bg. Also, since I come from a different background and with such high risk capital, I have all the more incentive and push to perform since I know I don't have an edge here. That would motivate me enough sir to perform. (Spoke more on this only)

P1: Why do you want to do MBA?

I: Tried explaining that I need formal structured training in management as through my internships in different domains during UG, I realised that I was equally interested in system level impact if not more than individual clinical session. I explained that I don't come from business family or netword and I need to build network for guidance also on my long term startup/ business project in physiotherapy domain.

P1: You can do that without 2 years of high risk capital investment as well. Why then?

I: Reiterated similar lines of thought as earlier.

P2: If you don't get roles in healthcare domain then what?

I: Tried to reason that in short term I need exposure and want to explore roles in domains such as gen mgmt or marketing in FMCG sector.

P2: Till when did you study maths?

I: Till 10th sir.

P2: Take a sheet of paper and draw the graph for this equation, y=5x+2

I: (Super simple linear equation, but couldn't draw neatly in first attempt and didn't plot multiple points)

P2: So, it passes through origin?

I: Randomly said yes sir.

P2: Tell me y intercept at x=0

I: Extrapolated the graph to see it did not pass through origin. Rectified myself excusing pressure of time on mind. Said, it doesn't pass through origin sir.

P2: Why don't you get some work experience before MBA? All your reasons are fine but why now?

I: (Messed this segment) Reiterated earlier thoughts on why MBA.

P2: Do you have any questions for us?

I: Yes sir, so I ask for your feedback on my direction. I ask for guidance as well. Actually, my reason for doing an MBA right now is this only that I want to train myself in managerial education. I believe MBA gives one a whole new perspective to things in life. And I also want to learn all the different aspects of a business. Building a network with similar inclination is also something I deeply value.

P2: See, every year about 10 to 12 people come to IIM from medical bg only, but what we have observed is that they face problems in securing placement. And this won't affect our selection criteria of you, the perspective you bring to the table is different but about the placements it may be a issue. And moreover, we feel right now you should get work experience first for 2 years and then think of MBA.

I: Tried to understand their perspective better and kept fishing for opportunity to express strongly why I was motivated for MBA.

P2: Alright, thankyou so much Nidhi. All the best. You may take a water bottle and toffee.

I: Looked through the flavours available.

P2: Take both. They are for you only.

I: (Picked one each) Thank you sir, thankyou sir (spoke to both individually).

I came out to hear from the next candidate that I took 30 mins and most other candidates in other panels were out in 15 mins max. Even she came out in 15 mins. (However, I am aware that it was because I spoke at length in all my answers and kept the discussion alive)

I believe I demonstrated good body language and soft skills but messed up my HR questions and other creative questions and even took more time than it takes for the linear eq question. Over all by the end of the interview, I got the vibe that the panel advised me to have work ex first. Now, I don't know what the verdict is gonna be, but I am more motivated for my next interviews now. My vercel predictor shoes I need 13-15 marks in PI for the convert for Indore.

1r791g4,https://www.reddit.com/r/tacticalgear/comments/1r791g4/training_competition_practice_a_rantdiscussion/,"Training, Competition, Practice- a Rant/Discussion","The coffee is flowing and I am bored so I am gonna do a minor rant here regarding getting better and staying better.

I do USPSA matches about once a month. I am not a grand master by any means but it has definitely made me a better shooter, simply because of the fact that I am using my gear and putting in dryfire reps.

I am constantly seeing clowning off and on the internet regarding how ""tHaT's NoT tRaInInG"" and it's ""useless, you should be doing training instead of competition!""

So here is a little remedial lesson for people who have gotten their wires crossed. This is also a post for discussion, so feel free to contribute, sharpen up my argument, whatever.

Training, competition, practice are all different things. Together, they make up a holistic approach to skill building a maintaining with firearms. There is some overlap, but ultimately they serve different purposes. Mixing them up or using one or two at the exclusion of the other(s) will harm you in the long run.

**What are the differences between training, competition, and practice?**

1. **Training** is acquiring a new skill you did not have before under the tutelage of a instructor who possesses that skill and has the ability to teach it to you. A session of training is called a class and classes are usually at least one day (but often two day), high round count events. They are high round count because you are learning a skill you did not have before, and unless you are some kind of forerunner-super-computer-android-polymath you will probably have to do a drill multiple times in order to learn it and do it well. This is where you should start if you want to learn how to shoot and don't know how. It's important to note that there are some people who are essentially self taught using YouTube, books, or the like. This takes quite a high amount of self discipline that a lot of people don't have, and that's ok. It's not bad to get taught by someone who knows what they are doing. This is why education as a career exists. There are polymaths but most people aren't polymaths, so they need teaching. Training is about **acquiring skills.**
2. **Practice** is about maintaining the skills you acquired in training. Practice is something that should be done daily, because practice does not necessarily require live fire. Practicing your draw stroke, trigger press, and reloads are all something that can be done at home and should be done at home. Ten minutes of dry fire every day, using the fundamentals you acquired in training will do wonders for your shooting, way more than going to the range once a month and blowing 500 rounds at a old fridge. You should also practice with live fire as well. Primarily, you practice marksmanship when you're at most ranges but if you are at a range that lets your practice other things, do so. Practice is about **maintaining skills.**
3. **Competition** is implementing the skills you acquired in training and maintained in practice. A session of competition is called a match and it is the best way for the average person to put their skills and gear to the test. Competition is beneficial because you get to put your skills and gear to the test *with unknown elements mixed in.* The temptation is very real in practice to only set up drills that you know you are good at, and tell yourself that those are the most important ones anyway. A lot of people are pretty good at bill drills or single A zone hits, but aren't so good at weak hand shooting. So they will never do any weak hand shooting and come up with all kinds of reasons why it's not necessary. Going to a competition blind (and some competitions are literally blind, where you cannot even do a stage walk through before you shoot, and you can do this all the time if you want) is a great skill, because life does not send you a stage brief before hitting you with a bad situation. Competition is about **implementing skills.**

**Common mistakes and objections:**

* ""Competition isn't training!"" Yes, I am aware, that's the whole point of the post. But the point of training is completely different. I have taken handgun classes, and I implement those skills in matches.
* ""You need to be under the watchful eye of a instructor to catch yourself making mistakes."" A element of this whole thing is that you need to be able to self correct. If you notice you're being lazy or unsafe on your draw stroke, fix it. Film yourself during competition or practice and watch it back. It will be a painful experience but you can see that you are not actually gripping where you need to grip, not indexing your reloads, or what have you. You really should not need to pay someone to catch your mistakes, it's a waste of money and time. If you are so self unaware that you need to pay 500 bucks for someone to bird dog you to tell you ""hey you did this wrong"" this over and over again, question if firearms is really the area for you. This is also why you have friends who will say ""hey dude your reload sucks"" and not charge for it.
* Taking the same class over and over again. There is no need to take, for example, defensive handgun from 5 different instructors. Doing this will only lead to confusion. This is usually borne out of never practicing and letting skills wither on the vine. Thus, the error goes that they have to go back and take basic courses repeatedly to make sure that their skills ""don't perish."" This is a massive waste of money. Nobody goes back to high school every year and sits in Driver's Ed to maintain their skills with driving.
* ""Competition is for gamers/unload and show clear will get you killed."" If you want to be a gamer, you can be. But 75% of the guys I shoot matches with run their duty rig (if cops) or belt kit (civilians.) There are some people with $5k guns and crazy DAA belt systems. They're good shooters for sure. That's what they want to do. Cool. The beef over ""unload and show clear"" at the end of a stage is usually by people who might be scared to actually put their skills to the test, on the clock and so act like they are better than the match. A administrative action off the clock at the end of the stage has no bearing on anything.

TL;DR:

Go a training class to acquire skills, practice to maintain the skills in order to shoot a match that implements the skills. Doing these out of order or doing one at the exclusion of the other(s) is a waste and in some cases can hurt you as a shooter.",2,1771342199.0,tacticalgear,6,0.63,False

1r78z1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buildingmyfutureself/comments/1r78z1x/the_psychology_of_attraction_if_these_happen_to/,"The Psychology of Attraction: If These Happen to You, You're More Attractive Than You Realize","You know what's wild? Most of us are walking around convinced we're average looking at best, meanwhile we're missing all the signs that people actually find us attractive. I spent months deep diving into psychology research, reading studies on attraction cues, and watching hours of body language analysis content. The truth? Attractiveness isn't just about your face or body. It's this weird mix of how people respond to your energy, your presence, and yeah, sometimes your looks too. But here's the kicker: you're probably way more attractive than you think, you just don't know what signs to look for.

We're conditioned by social media and beauty standards to think attractive people get constant compliments and obvious attention. But real life doesn't work like that. Attraction shows up in subtle, weird ways that most people completely miss. So if you've ever wondered whether people actually find you attractive, here are the signs backed by research and human behavior patterns.

People get nervous or awkward around you

This one's counterintuitive as hell. You'd think attractive people make others feel comfortable, right? Wrong. Research in social psychology shows that when someone finds you attractive, their nervous system literally activates. They might:

Fidget with their hair or clothes when talking to you

Stumble over their words or laugh at things that aren't funny

Avoid eye contact or make TOO much eye contact (both extremes signal the same thing)

Touch their face or neck repeatedly

These aren't signs they dislike you. Their brain is basically short circuiting because you're triggering their attraction response. Think about it, when was the last time you acted totally normal around someone you found really attractive? Exactly.

Strangers remember random details about you

Ever mention something casual in passing, then weeks later someone brings it up again? That's not normal memory. That's selective attention, and it happens when your brain flags someone as important or interesting.

According to cognitive psychology research, we remember details about people we're attracted to or intrigued by. It's called the ""attention bias."" If a coworker remembers you mentioned your favorite coffee order three months ago, or someone recalls that obscure band you like, your presence is making an impression. People don't commit mental energy to remembering details about someone they find forgettable.

You get copied, a lot

Mirroring is one of the most researched attraction indicators in behavioral science. When people subconsciously copy your body language, speech patterns, or even your opinions, it's because they're drawn to you. This includes:

Adopting phrases you use

Sitting or standing in similar positions

Ordering the same drink as you

Suddenly being interested in your hobbies

Dr. Tanya Chartrand's research on the ""chameleon effect"" shows we unconsciously mimic people we like or admire. If you notice people around you picking up your mannerisms, congratulations, you're influencing them without even trying.

People seek your approval, even on small things

Pay attention to this one. Do people ask your opinion on things that don't really matter? ""Does this look okay?"" ""What do you think of this idea?"" ""Should I get this?""

When someone values your opinion on random stuff, it's because your validation matters to them more than they're letting on. Attractive people (and I mean attractive in presence, not just looks) become unconscious authority figures. Others want to impress you or get your approval because your opinion holds weight in their mind.

This ties into social proof theory. We seek validation from people we perceive as having higher social or aesthetic value.

You're excluded from certain social situations

Wait, what? Yeah, this sounds backwards, but hear me out. Sometimes you're NOT invited to things specifically because you're intimidating. Not in a scary way, but in a ""you're out of our league"" way.

Groups exclude people they perceive as too attractive or socially elevated because it messes with their group dynamic. They worry you'll outshine them or won't vibe with their energy. If you've ever felt weirdly left out of casual hangouts but included in ""important"" events, this might be why. It's not always about being disliked. Sometimes it's about people protecting their comfort zones.

[The Like Switch](https://gemini.google.com/app/29bb7aa1d1ef2caa) by Jack Schafer dives deep into this. Former FBI agent turned psychologist, Schafer explains how attraction and social dynamics work in ways that contradict what we assume. He breaks down why people sometimes distance themselves from those they find attractive, it's a defense mechanism.

People get defensive or competitive around you

Ever notice someone trying really hard to one up you in conversations? Or getting weirdly defensive when you succeed at something? That's not hate, that's threatened ego.

Research on social comparison theory shows that when people perceive someone as more attractive or successful, they either try to compete or distance themselves. If someone constantly feels the need to prove themselves around you, you're triggering their insecurity, which means you have something they want or admire.

Your opinions shift group consensus

In group settings, do people tend to agree with you more than others? Even when your take isn't groundbreaking? Attractive people, and again this is about overall presence, have what psychologists call ""social capital."" Your words carry more weight because people subconsciously assign you higher status.

This is called the ""halo effect,"" where one positive trait (like attractiveness or confidence) makes people assume you're competent in other areas too. If your suggestions get adopted more often than others', even in casual conversations, you've got more influence than you realize.

People get protective or helpful without you asking

Do strangers offer to help you carry stuff? Does someone always jump in to defend you in arguments? Do people go out of their way to make your life easier?

This is called ""benevolent attention,"" and it's one of the clearest signs people are drawn to you. Humans are tribal. We protect and help people we value or find appealing. If you're getting unsolicited help or protection, it's because people are subconsciously trying to stay in your good graces.

[The Social Animal](https://gemini.google.com/app/29bb7aa1d1ef2caa) by Elliot Aronson is a classic here. Aronson, one of the most influential social psychologists, breaks down why we help attractive people more and how social hierarchies form around perceived value. It's not always conscious. Most of the time, people don't even realize why they're going out of their way for you.

If you want a structured way to develop these patterns further, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://gemini.google.com/app/29bb7aa1d1ef2caa) that pulls insights from psychology books like these, attraction research, and expert interviews on charisma and social dynamics. Built by a team from Columbia University, it creates personalized audio learning plans based on specific goals, like becoming more magnetic in social situations or understanding body language better. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples, and choose voices that actually keep you engaged. It's surprisingly useful for anyone wanting to level up their social intelligence without reading dozens of books.

You get more leeway when you mess up

Notice how some people can screw up and everyone forgives them instantly, while others get roasted? If you're in the first category, congrats, you've got the halo effect working for you.

Studies show that attractive people (broadly defined) are given more chances, judged less harshly, and forgiven faster. If people laugh off your mistakes or make excuses for you when you're late or flaky, they've already decided you're worth keeping around.

People stare, then look away fast

This one's obvious but often misread. If you catch people looking at you and they immediately glance away, that's attraction, not judgment. Humans instinctively look at things that interest us, but we also don't want to get caught staring.

Research on gaze behavior shows prolonged eye contact triggers vulnerability. If someone keeps sneaking glances at you but avoids direct eye contact, their brain is screaming ""this person is attractive"" while their social conditioning is saying ""don't be a creep.""

Your energy changes rooms

Do conversations shift when you walk in? Do people perk up or adjust their behavior? This isn't about being loud or commanding attention. It's about presence.

Some people just have gravitational pull. If you notice group dynamics shift when you arrive or leave, you're affecting the social atmosphere more than you think. That's magnetic energy, and it's one of the most underrated forms of attractiveness.

Look, attractiveness isn't some fixed thing you either have or don't. It's fluid. It's contextual. And most of us are way too stuck in our own heads to notice when people are actually drawn to us. The signs are there. You're just not looking for them. Stop comparing yourself to filtered Instagram models and start paying attention to how real humans react to you in real life. That's where the truth lives.",1,1771342054.0,Buildingmyfutureself,0,1.0,False

1r78y4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/OWLCITY/comments/1r78y4f/she_was_indeed_a_deer_in_the_headlights_update/,She was indeed a Deer in the Headlights. (UPDATE),"TL;DR: A week ago today, I posted here about how I had my eye on a really cute girl at the gym that I wanted to ask out and couldn’t get Deer in the Headlights out of my head. Well, she appeared again and I spoke to her. The outcome: >!There’s someone luckier than me already.!<

(Rant warning again)

By the time I spoke to her, 13 days had passed since she showed up and with week 2 almost gone, I walked on the treadmill, overwhelmed by the idea that she was gone for good and I would never even get a chance.

But then she walked by and caught my eye. Alone this time. I practically leapt off and went up to her, told her I thought she was really pretty and would love to take her out to coffee or lunch.

She didn’t smile, but she didn’t sneer either, indeed, a Deer in the Headlights. What she was about to say was a total coin toss to me, but tails it was. She thanked me and said she already had a boyfriend.

Even though I’m disappointed and would’ve loved to walk away knowing her name, I have nothing to regret, be angry over or feel sad about. I’m glad I got it over with and didn’t have to resent myself for not asking sooner.

I don’t think I’ve ever actually asked a girl out in such a casual way before and this experience has taught me a lot about Deer in the Headlights. Mainly that while it is about shooting your shot, it’s also about the intimidation and rejection; I’m definitely glad I didn’t get pepper sprayed or told I’m not her type. 

Adam said himself on tour that Deer in the Headlights is “about really pretty girls”, not just one girl. Even though her face is one of a kind and truly unique, there will be other faces that make you forget what everyone else in the room looks like and I’ll continue to work on myself and live by this song until I walk by and an unforgettable face catches my eye.

1r78y3u,https://i.redd.it/vyz51en5p2kg1.jpeg,Your initial thoughts? The Martian March 16 Jacket,"Be interested to hear your initial impression?

https://vollebak.com/products/martian-mach-16-jacket-rover-orange-edition

The Martian Mach 16 Jacket isn’t just made out of the single most high performance material in our solar system – it’s quite possibly the single most important material in human history so far.

We’ll start by pointing out the obvious – the material the Martian Mach 16 Jacket is made from, wasn’t created to build clothes.

 

It started life as a hypersonic deep space parachute designed to land a multi-billion dollar mission a billion miles away in the outer solar system – on a moon shrouded in methane monsoons, and covered in cryovolcanoes spewing out jets of −179°C hydrocarbon rain.

 

…So it’s just a couple of levels of performance up from your average umbrella.

 

To put a billion miles in perspective, the space-junk we left on the moon is only about 240,000 miles away. A billion miles is also 1,300 times further away than the James Webb Telescope. And over five million times further from Earth than the International Station.

 

It also takes a long time to travel a billion miles. So by the time the parachute was deployed it had been in the deep freeze of deep space for 7 years – so it’s a pleasant surprise that it didn’t pull a hamstring.

 

Instead it successfully landed the first probe in the outer solar system – which is the furthest any human spacecraft had ever landed.

 

And during its 2.5 hour parachute-assisted descent, the Cassini-Huygens probe sent back images to Earth of the surface of Titan – a place NASA thinks might be a likely future home.

 

It wasn’t done yet though. Because over a decade later, it was brought out of retirement to land the Perseverance Rover on Mars – the other place where humans are trying to get a foot on the property ladder.

 

On 18 February 2021, as the Rover was heading towards Mars at 20,000kmph, or Mach 16, the parachute was put to work again. This time it was given just over a second to slow the Rover down to 320kmph in a −60°C Martian dust storm.

 

Now braking instantaneously at Mach 16 is not easy. For reference Tom Cruise was flying a lot slower than that in the last Top Gun as he used Earth’s atmosphere as a one man racetrack – hitting a conservative Mach 10. And if he’d braked to a stop in just over a second he’d have turned into soup.

 

This braking strength is even more astonishing given how light the material is. The entire 21.5 metre wide parachute was packed into a nose cone about the size of the average backpack.

 

Today you’ll find Perseverance still happily trundling around Mars, and the parachute in a slightly untidy, dusty heap in the Jezero Crater.

 

So if you, your kids, or your grandchildren, end up on these planets, sipping a coffee watching the Earth rise, we’ll have this material to thank.

 

It helped give the world today a window into the worlds of tomorrow.

 

And as you’d imagine, a material that can survive methane monsoons, cryogenic cold, Martian dust storms, hydrocarbon rain, cryovolcanoes and hypersonic braking, also makes a pretty miraculous jacket here on Earth.  

 

The Martian Mach 16 Jacket comes in a Project Mercury edition that’s based on the first spacesuits of the Mercury Program. And a Rover Orange edition – which is the same International Orange used in the Perseverance parachute.

I'm from out of town but visit Los Angeles monthly, and this will be my first time attending an LA Phil concert at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. It has been a bucket list item, especially a concert that has arrangements by John Williams.

While the maestro John Williams is not going to be in attendance, hopefully you appreciate his musical scores, and are generally a fan of movies that he has scored like Star Wars, Harry Potter, Jurassic Park. Although I don't believe this concert have those cult classics on the program.

**What I'm looking for**

A female between the ages of 25-42 who appreciates classical music and soundtrack music. Ideally we can talk about our favorite movies and soundtrack composers!

Someone who likes fine dining, good wine, and effortless conversation. The evening will start with a nice meal, getting to know each other, and then working our way to the event. I am in town the day before too, so if you'd like to meet more casually for a coffee before before spending hours together, we can do that also.

I'm not expecting more than the above, ideally we click intellectually, and there is a natural connection, but first and foremost I'm looking for an attendance partner that will have fun, enjoy herself, appreciate the performance, and be comfortable and at ease with being treated -- I am not expecting anything in return.

**About me**

For those that care about my physical look, I'm 6'1"" (6'2"" with the right shoes), dark complexion, short and straight black hair, broad shouldered/strong but not a bodybuilder type, have a short beard most of the time. My line of work is in enterprise technology consulting.

I'm a big movie soundtrack guy. I sincerely and deeply connect with good musical arrangements, including non-soundtrack classical music. Can talk about almost anything, and am always willing to engage in tough conversations respectfully.  
**You made it here...**

If you're interested, just drop me a DM, I'm new to Reddit, so will follow your lead on the decorum of how to work towards a call eventually. With ample time before the concert, I'm hoping we could casually get to know each other with no pressure and flow into meeting in person before or the day of the concert naturally.

My husband (51yr w LBD) is a different person. We are kind of new to this, just diagnosed but having symptoms for about 2-3 years.

I noticed about 3 years ago that he became less interested in me. He was more distracted by TV/social media. He used to text or call me multiple times a day, buy flowers, bring me coffee, pay attention to where I was/would be. That all stopped.

Fast forward to late 2024, he has a ""girlfriend"" in texas. All virtual of course and I prove she is fake. Find the fake accounts etc. Suggest we find him someone else to talk to.

Summer of 2025, he starts asking for money. He begins to beg. My father died in August and around this time my husband starts telling me he is fixing all our money problems. You readers are smart enough to know that he was being scammed. I never found out the exact number, but he ""borrowed"" over 30k from family and at least 10k from our accounts. Surprisingly,  his Texas ""girlfriend"" has stopped responding to him in January... 

I am angry. I am mad. I am frustrated that he cannot hear reality through his delusions sometimes. 

Thursday of last week, about 30 minutes after dropping the kids off at school (17 and 7), I let our elder dog outside.

My husband saw me, saw the dog, and continued to smoke his cigarette. 

About 10 minutes later, he is ""cleaning"" ... carrying around two of my sweaters and I ask, 'where is waffles?'... he says he left him outside to pee.
I loudly tell him to go get him. About a minute later I hear my husband yelling for the dog. Apparently, a male driver then pulls into our driveway visibly shaken. (I dont know this until days later)

Husband comes back inside to grab a hat? And is frantic. The driver then brings him up the road where he had just hit and killed our dog.

I am outside, I cant see this as there is a bend in the road, but soon after my husband comes walking down the road carrying our 12lb supermutt. He is warm still, but clearly dead. 

I am broken. My heart cracked. This dog has grown up with my daughter, 13 years together, kindergarten to senior year.

Start eating the ice cream instead,"I finally realized why I've been staring at the same IMPORTANT task for three days while my brain literally feels like it’s shutting down. We have all heard the classic productivity advice: ""Eat the frog"" do the hardest, ugliest thing first thing in the morning and the rest of your day will be a breeze.  

  

SPOILER ALTERT If I try to eat the frog first, I just spend six hours staring at the frog, feeling like a total failure, and then I end up on a Wikipedia deep dive about the history of the Apollo 11 moon landing (did you know they landed four miles off course? lol anyway, back to the point)

The problem isn't that we are lazy or unmotivated. It is that our brains don't actually care about (importance or consequences ;-;) in the same way neurotypical brains do. For us, trying harder isn't a solution. It is just more effective at making us feel like we are drowning (yep...)

The Motivation Flaw: Most productivity systems (like GTD or Inbox Zero) were built for neurotypical brains. They rely on a ""trust"" in your own brain that we just don't have yet. My brain doesn't care if a task is ""important."" It cares if it provides dopamine.

When we hit a point of overwhelm, our brains don't just ""power through."" They shut down. It feels like someone handed you a baby while you were already underwater. You can't breathe, and someone is tossing you more responsibilities.

The 4 C’s of ADHD Motivation: Instead of forcing the ""Frog,"" I’ve started looking for the Four C’s. This is how we actually get the engine moving:

Captivate: Is there a part of this project that is actually fascinating?

Create: Can I turn this boring task into a creative problem to solve?

Compete: Can I gamify this? (can I finish these five emails before the coffee finish brewing) got it??

Complete: Can I set a hard, urgent deadline that actually feels real!!

Strategies That Actually Work (For Now)

The biggest thing I've learned is to Embrace the Pivot. I used to feel so much shame when a new system or app stopped working after two weeks. Now, I just realize my brain is bored and needs novelty. That is okay. It didn't ""fail,"" it just finished its usefulness for that cycle.

A few things I’m trying this week: Eat the Ice Cream First: I do a task that I actually enjoy or find creative first. This builds the momentum. Once the ""train"" is moving, it is way easier to tackle the boring stuff.

Micro-Commitments: I’m not ""cleaning the kitchen."" I am putting exactly three dishes away. Usually, I do more, but if I only do three, I still ""won"" that goal.

Side Quests: If I'm stuck on a main project, I let myself take a ""side quest"" on a related, more interesting angle for 15 minutes. It sparks the brain back to life (mostly i like to keep a white sheet in the desk and write any sudden apperaance of those 1M dollars ideas lmaoo)

Stop blaming yourself for not being able to follow systems that weren't built for you. You aren't a broken neurotypical person, you just have an interest-based nervous system.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go finish those three dishes before I forget why I walked into the kitchen in the first place (';",2,1771341751.0,studentheon,0,1.0,False

1r78spi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r78spi/im_living_with_my_mum_who_refuses_to_live/,"I'm living with my mum who refuses to live hygienically and I'm physically unable to maintain the house alone or move out - I feel stuck, I'm at a loss and don't know what to do anymore","I’m 24 and live in the UK. I have chronic illnesses (POTS, MCAS and hEDS) which limit my physical energy and make overexertion cause significant health flare-ups.

I live with my mum in my nan’s house. My parents divorced in 2019 and we moved here together. In 2021 my nan moved to Spain and the tenancy is now in my mum’s name.

Before this house, my mum and I were extremely close. We had more of a best friend relationship, rather than a mother/daughter one. She went out, took care of herself, kept the house clean and we did everything together. Over the last 4 years she has completely changed.

She stays in her bedroom almost 24/7 either gaming or sleeping. She rarely comes downstairs, rarely cooks for herself, and relies on others to bring her food even though she physically can do so herself. She has had depression her whole life and suspected autism, but the situation has gotten beyond that. She openly says she doesn’t care about hygiene or “society’s standards” anymore and prefers living like this, that she is genuinely happy to live the way she does and wouldn’t want it any other way. She says the reason she no longer keep up with personal hygiene or maintenance of the household is because it’s boring and she’d much rather spend her time on her video games.

Because of this, the house becomes very dirty and I cannot keep up with it by myself.

• dirty dishes are left around in her bedroom and the kitchen for days with excess food and sauce dried and rotting to the sides of them

• sink and counters constantly filled with dirty dishes and rubbish so I can’t cook for myself or clean my own personally used dishes without cleaning her mess first

• coffee and food stains left in the carpets until they become permanent; she spills things and then can’t be bothered to clean it up so by the time I come across it, it has already penetrated deeply into the carpets. this leaves an awful smell in the house, and the brand new cream carpets 4 years ago are now covered in stains.

• if I don’t do it myself, the toilet and bathroom gets cleaned every 3-4 weeks but only if I repeatedly ask her to do so

• house smells awful due to buildup of mess/dirt which makes it so embarrassing when guests come over and I tend to avoid having friends over.

• she doesn’t shower, change her own bedding, or brush her teeth enough, leaving her once white bedsheets yellow.

When I deep clean and do everything for her in order to make the house feel more comfortable for myself to live in, the house is ruined again within 24–48 hours and all my efforts are wasted.

I physically cannot maintain the house due to my conditions, but if I stop cleaning, it becomes unliveable. If I ask her to help she becomes angry, raises her voice and says I’m overreacting, I’m “over-clean” and that I make her feel like it isn’t her house anymore with all my “nagging”.

I feel trapped because:

• I can’t afford to move out due to not having a job

• I feel guilty because I have a roof over my head and food so I feel I shouldn’t be so stressed and depressed with my living arrangements

• I miss my mum — it feels like she’s not the same person now, like I don’t even have a mum anymore

Family members have spoken to her many times and nothing changes. She is genuinely happy living this way.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do in this situation. Has anyone dealt with a parent who just refuses to function or maintain hygiene?

I am hoping to get a job soon which hopefully means I can move out within the next year or two but I really don’t know how to cope with it all for that long.

*“Is there a God tonight, up in the sky, or is it empty just like me?”*

The words didn’t echo. They didn’t come back wiser. They just sat there in the air like a cigarette ember refusing to die.

He was standing on a balcony that belonged to nobody in particular, overlooking a city that acted like it had answers. Streetlights lined the roads in perfect rows, cars flowed like thoughtless blood, and distant windows blinked with people living their lives as if living was simple.

He had tried the usual things.

Work. Noise. Gym. Friends. New goals. Old goals rewritten with new fonts. He had even tried “gratitude,” which mostly felt like apologizing to the universe for being hungry when he should’ve been full. Nothing stuck. His chest had become a quiet apartment with no furniture, and every time he came home to himself, the emptiness greeted him like a polite stranger.

So he stared into the sky as if it owed him a conversation.

Nothing dramatic happened. No angelic chorus. No sign carved into the clouds. Just the old, brutal calm of starlight.

He laughed once. Not because it was funny, but because the alternative was to break.

Then, on the street below, a small thing happened. A delivery cyclist stopped to help an old man pick up a bag that had torn open, spilling oranges across the sidewalk. The cyclist crouched, gathered them one by one, and handed them back like each orange mattered. The old man put a palm to the cyclist’s shoulder, not as payment, just as acknowledgment. A tiny moment of human weight in a world that often felt hollow.

He watched it and felt something shift, just slightly, like a door in his ribcage cracking open.

He didn’t suddenly believe. He didn’t suddenly stop hurting.

But he thought, maybe the question isn’t only *“Is there a God tonight?”* Maybe the question is also: *“If the sky is empty, what am I going to put in the world?”*

The next day, he woke up and did something embarrassingly small. He made his bed. Not the triumphant, influencer kind of bed-making. Just tugged the sheets into place like he was laying down a boundary against chaos.

He walked outside without headphones.

On a whim, he bought a coffee for the barista who looked like she’d been running on fumes for weeks. She blinked at him, surprised, and then smiled in that cautious way people smile when life offers them something gentle and they’re not sure they deserve it.

He kept moving.

He called a friend he’d been ignoring. He didn’t perform. He didn’t tell a heroic version of the truth. He just said, “I’ve been having a hard time,” and let the sentence stand on its own legs.

That night, he returned to the balcony.

The same city. The same sky.

He whispered the lyric again, softer this time, less like an accusation and more like a confession:

*“Is there a God tonight, up in the sky, or is it empty just like me?”*

And he waited.

Still nothing. No booming answer.

But there was a memory of oranges on the pavement, hands gathering them back into order. There was the barista’s smile. There was his friend’s voice, the way it warmed when it realized he wasn’t calling to ask for something, just calling to be real.

He looked down at his palms, as if he’d forgotten what they were for.

Maybe God wasn’t a voice that arrived from above.

Maybe God was a verb.

Maybe the sky stayed silent because it wasn’t the sky’s job to fill him.

Maybe the emptiness wasn’t proof of nothingness, but proof of space. Space where something could be built. Space where meaning could be made, not found. Space where even a tired, hollow man could become a candle instead of a complaint.

He didn’t solve the universe that night.

But he made a deal with himself.

If the sky was empty, he would still live as if it mattered to be good.

And if he was empty, he would still keep showing up, one small act at a time, until the emptiness learned a new shape.",1,1771341585.0,story,0,1.0,False

1r78r87,https://kilala.ai,"I got frustrated with existing digital business card generators, so I built my own!","I've been working on Kilala ([https://kilala.ai](https://kilala.ai)), a digital business card app that lets you create a shareable card via link or QR code.

Why I built it: Most digital business card tools charge $8-15/mo for basic stuff like showing your email and phone number. I wanted something with a generous free tier that doesn't paywall basic features. Every digital business card app locks the good-looking designs behind the paywall; or locks the analytics, and man the designs are terribly outdated or plain ugly. That frustrated me enough to build my own, where ***every single feature is available for free!***



**What it does:**

* Create a customizable digital business card (templates, colors, fonts, layouts)
* Share via link or QR code; you can also add your contact cards to your apple wallet so you can tap-to-share!
* Track views and contact clicks with analytics
* Create a nice-looking email signature with the data of your contact card; you can copy and paste it to Outlook, Gmail, Proton Mail, etc.
* Capture leads from people who visit your card; the card itself will ask the recipient party if they'd like to connect with you
* 25 free views/month on the free plan (equivalent to having 25 paper cards with you)
* Every single design template/background/font/upcoming feature is free, forever



**Tech stack (for the curious):**

* Next.js 15 App Router (though I should have gone with Tanstack start in retrospect maybe)
* tRPC v11
* Prisma + Postgres
* Tailwind v4
* Clerk for auth
* [Polar.sh](http://Polar.sh) for payments because Stripe doesn't work well with payouts for Guatemala where I live
* Deployed on Vercel

What I learned building this:

* Getting opengraph images to work (especially dynamically generated ones) reliably across Twitter/LinkedIn/iMessage was surprisingly painful, mainly because the dumb cache thing these pages do.
* It's unbelievable how many small things can go wrong the moment you launch the app. I had unforeseen issues with Google auth setup; I had to configure a non-trivial number of dependencies and services to get the app running. Actually shipping something to prod, outside of the boundaries of your machine is actually quite crazy; happy to have had that learning experience
* A mass amount of coffee was consumed in the making of this app. No regrets

Would love any feedback on the landing page or the card experience. What would make you actually use something like this?",2,1771341542.0,SideProject,3,1.0,False

Not sure if this type of post is allowed here. I’ve been sitting on this story since last year and have been frustrated feeling like I’ve been silenced. I don’t want to ruin anyone but I do want to warn people in the area, especially artists or teachers who are looking for work. /:
I will explain why I’m posting this further down.

Last year I was kind of desperate for work and I was emailing around and I was fortunate enough to get in with the local Sutherland Arts studio in Voorhees. I was taking what I could get even though I got paid through a check at the end of every month. I was told my pay would start at $15 but had the potential to go up when they deemed fit. I loved teaching the classes because I’ve worked with kids for a long time, and eventually I was even teaching adult classes.

I lived very close by and the owner knew that so she tried to take advantage of that on occasion and ask me to come in out of nowhere in half an hour to teach a class her son was supposed to teach but got tired or something and couldn’t. On days I worked gallery instead of teaching, very early on when I had little experience on my own yet, the owner would leave to “get coffee” and then leave me alone for hours at a time. In that timeframe I was supposed to clean but eventually cleaning would end and she wouldn’t always answer her phone so I’d sit and wait, exhausted from the extensive cleaning list.

The owner had cameras in the studio and would check them religiously. If she saw or heard something she didn’t like during class (or gallery) she would call immediately. I was told my phone had to be on ringer and I had to answer those calls immediately. I’ll skip over every detail but it got to the point where I would be told to clean and rearrange the basement/store room on my gallery days, even while she was out for hours running errands. I suppose you could argue that was my job but I was hired as a teacher.

Since I was teaching all these classes, my pay went up drastically, and I was grateful. Then summer came and my pay was docked to $15 again because “we weren’t getting enough students”. I kept teaching the adults weekly, and was told I was in charge but the owner never liked my ideas on teaching subjects and would change them five minutes before class started, then she would sit in during class and tell me what to do. It felt really tense.

There were little moments that didn’t stand out to me, but did to her. She suggested I move some tables around for class, but phrased it as a question like asking if I thought we should move them, so I said no I think they’re fine! I found out later on over the phone that she counted that as a strike against me, one out of three. 

Then came summer camp. Summer camp was like an all day class for little kids, with several different art projects in a day, lunch, three outside breaks, 5-10 kids, and one teacher: me. Truthfully I could hardly prep my crafts without the owner on the phone in my ear telling me to change everything I’m doing, despite her not even being in the building. Camp took place in the basement that I had cleaned and completely rearranged, and it was a nice break from Big Brother because there are no cameras down there, but that just means more phone calls. It’s hard to try to teach kids when every five minutes you’re on a phone call you HAVE to take. 

Most of the time camp was fine but it was exhausting and I was always meant to take the kids outside by myself, despite it being extremely hot, they had to play on a sidewalk in the parking lot, and I asked again and again if I could be the one to stay inside because I had a horrible heat intolerance (which I’ve recently found out is related to a medical condition). The kids eventually got bored of chalk and bubbles and started searching for bugs. They found a live beetle, which I knew was harmless, so I allowed them to hold it carefully and observe kindly, which they all did. They washed their hands inside when we were done. The owner did not like this, because she could see us on yet another camera. She said the kids weren’t allowed to play with bugs anymore because they carry eggs and are disgusting. It frustrated me but sure whatever, no more bugs. The kids were extremely disappointed by that, because I had to take that phone call and then announce to them that the owner said no more bugs. I didn’t even have an answer when they asked why. They’re kids. 

Camp was my last straw working there. One day all the kids painted unicorns. I hand traced the template onto all of the canvases for the kids and they got to paint it how they liked. We wanted them to look nice, of course, but some of these kids are like five. I’m not going to police ANY child’s artwork unless it’s inappropriate or concerning (which I sometimes had to do in class). One of the children messed up on the eye, so she decided to paint over it and make a bigger eye and add eyelashes. I thought it looked cute and unique to that child. She left for the day and the owner came downstairs, looked at all of the unicorns, saw the one that looked slightly different from the rest, and told me to paint over it and fix it. I genuinely thought she meant “paint over the messy spots” because she only motioned with her finger to “clean that up a little” so I smoothed out the messy edges where the paint was outside the lines. Went back up and told her I was done and left for the day. She texts me while I’m in the parking lot, something along the lines of “I gave you a warning, this is your last chance”, I can’t really remember. So I’m shocked, and I just cry the whole way home, even though I should’ve gone back in. I call her and she doesn’t say anything when she picks up, so I do and I’m trying to stop crying. I ask what I did wrong because I’m confused, and she says, “I told you I didn’t like that unicorn and I wanted you to paint over it and instead you added eyelashes to it.” And I’m extremely confused and trying to clarify I definitely did NOT do that! The child did that! I just didn’t understand what she meant when she said paint over it. She tells me this is my second strike and I’m like what was strike one??? The tables. When I didn’t fix them properly. Eventually she realized I was telling the truth because I was inconsolably crying (unfortunately I don’t handle confrontation well) and she felt bad she made me cry but for a while on that phone call she was a nasty woman. Things didn’t feel the same after that so that was my breaking point, knowing she could fire me over something stupid at any moment.

It wasn’t long after that that I resigned. I typed a professional letter and brought it to the studio to do before my next class but she decided not to come that night. So I taught class. This class had two teachers so it would’ve been alright if I’d resigned, the kids are teens. Unfortunately this meant I’d have to just send an email in addition to the letter, which was also professionally written. The response was basically: you’re an independent contractor and your services are no longer needed so you don’t need to come in anymore. Alright, whatever. I thought that was the end of it. It was not! I logged onto social media to find that I was blocked everywhere by her accounts. Instagram, Facebook, etc. Before being blocked, I saw that any photos I was in I was cropped out of. Captions were all changed to remove my name. All of this was within ONE HOUR of me giving my two weeks. Eventually I was so frustrated and hurt I wrote a review saying it was a bad place to work but I deleted it after the owner, who knew about my mental health struggles (I never struggled with that job!) responded to my review and tried to frame it as “we tried to help you but this just wasn’t for you” as if I was violently mentally ill or something. Just straight up BS.

So I’m writing this now several months later because I’m trying to get my 1099 from them, but I have absolutely no way of contacting them since I’m blocked everywhere and no one will answer my phone calls or voicemails lol. I was told yesterday I actually don’t really need the 1099 apparently but since all of this has felt so fresh again I just needed to get it out somewhere. This is not a good place to work. Their services are nice but they’re expensive as hell. And the owner seems nice but she has two faces and a need to micromanage and control EVERYTHING. The stuff I wrote isn’t even the half of it man.

Also from what I’ve seen recently, they fully support Generative AI, despite being an art studio.

I really don’t know how this is going to be received, I promise it’s not “disgruntled ex employee seeks revenge!” but I really think the community should know how they treat employees there. Please don’t review bomb anybody or leave hateful things on social media. I’m posting this in good faith, I promise. All of it is true from my account.",47,1771341451.0,SouthJersey,29,0.8,False

Been going on for around 8 years. In researching, I believe I have some sort of SIBO. I’ve been tested twice (four years apart) and both were negative all the way until the last sample at the end of the test (and wasn’t very large response). Doctor said the tests were inconclusive both times. Hoping someone else has had my symptoms and found a successful treatment.

1. I hack up frothy sputum. Basically clear spit with a lot of small bubbles. Worst in the mornings but have to clear my throat throughout the day. Most of the time is white. Sometimes first hack in the morning is brown but other than that its white.

2. Frothy sputum is also very bad when exercising. Have to hack up same nasty bubbly/frothy spit while on runs.                                                        

3. Very hard to hack up at times, makes me gag a lot. Have to hack hard to get it up my throat

4. Can hear quiet bubbles popping in the back of my throat, mostly at night or in the morning.

5. Drinking water makes me hack up the spit almost every drink. Drinking alcohol or coffee helps calm my stomach down. After one drink, I don’t hack anything up until morning. Drinking seems to temporarily cure everything. I don’t hack up spit and can eat whatever I want.

6. If I drink all weekend, my stomach is usually fine on Monday (even when I don’t drink), then Tuesday it goes back to being bad.

7. Feel very bloated every time I eat, unless I’m drunk. Not very hungry unless I’m drunk.

8. Tried numerous diets. They help lose weight but not with the frothy spit issue.

* Alcohol Free
* Gluten Free
* Dairy Free
* Meat and veggies only
* Acid Watchers Diet

9. Tried all sorts of probiotics and they didn’t help.

10. Tried atrantil and milk thistle right now, haven’t helped much.

11. Took fluconazole antibiotic thinking it might be Candida overgrowth. That didn’t help.

12. Took rifaximin antiobitc for SIBO, that also didn’t help.

13. Never had Heartburn (maybe 1-2x in my life)

M and I seemed to be best friends, although I was mostly carrying the friendship and that caught up to me later on.

One day, while I was helping M clean his grandpa's old apartment (his grandpa moved into a nursing home) with his mother, she showed me a very pretty decorative bowl with ornaments in it. I told her how I would've loved to take it with me, since I was free to take anything in the apartment. She said that it was an old wedding gift for her father (M's grandpa) and her mother and she will make an exception and actually gifted it to me. I promised her that I would take good care of it. M's mother seemed to like me a lot, maybe because her son didn't really have that many long lasting friendships with anyone and she wanted to get to know him better. I used to meet up with his mom a few times a year for a coffee too, but we rarely contacted each other.

Two years later, I went no contact with M because I realized I couldn't carry on with our friendship after all these years. I still have the wedding gift and ever since then, I've been thinking of sending it back to M's mother since I am not friends with her son anymore and she probably wants it back anyway. I do not have the phone number of M's mother, most of our contact happened through M.

projection is strong in the first 30 mins and after 1 hour its slowly projecting less and less by 2nd hour it becomes skin scent around 3-4 hours it completely vanishes 

kinda disappointed with its longevity i specifically bought it cuz it lasts all day

but the **juice quality** is so good the **opening** reminds me of **club de nuit intense men** without all that synthetic mess 

the citrus is citrusing really well and fruityness is so high quality 

i cant smell pineapple note idk even in cdnim and afnan sce i couldnt find pineapple note i feel like its in the background adding the sweetness to the overall topnotes 

i wonder if this is how *creed aventus’s* opening smells like??

i can start smelling dry down after 1 hour it hits with intense woody oakmoss smell (i like it)

u might say im going nose blind but i sniffed coffee and sniffed back my perfume i cant smell it after 4th hour

i also tested/compared its performance with my savuage perfum by spraying on wrists, hecvicat is just stronger and intense in a good way

i went to sleep with perfumes on my wrists and after 7 hours i could get some whiffs from savuage but nothing from hecvicat 

# also im curious what is my batch/year is my nishane is from?

I have a storage locker by Leon's so their truck will be literally four or five feet from all contents.  The move is a couple of Km into a one bedroom apartment very close to the Dairy Queen and the building has elevators. 

Contents include a 7 ft sofa, a loveseat, a small dining room table, coffee table and some bookshelves.  The remainder will be boxes so efficient packing of the vehicle will be very easy.

I can't imagine the entire job from start to finish taking more than 3 hours for two professionals and I'm confident a 10 or 12 ft van/truck would be more than sufficient

1r78cry,https://tipstor.com/organic-wine-route-in-marlborough-new-zealand/,"Organic Wine Route in Marlborough, New Zealand","The most powerful travel tool rarely appears in packing lists, yet it weighs nothing and transforms every mile. Ten minutes of daily meditation. In airports, on mountain trails, in swaying train cars, or on quiet balconies overlooking unfamiliar streets, the ritual becomes a mental compass that steadies travelers while the world rushes past in brilliant, unpredictable motion. The practice is simple. Guided breathing through an app or quiet mindfulness without technology. Yet the results ripple outward, sharpening focus, easing stress, and creating a calm resilience that turns unexpected travel moments into opportunities rather than obstacles.

The ideal season to begin the meditation challenge is any season that involves movement, though it becomes especially powerful during high-adventure travel months when schedules tighten and environments change quickly. Imagine starting the day with ten minutes of stillness before hiking alpine ridges, surfing coastal waves, trekking rainforest trails, or cycling across vineyard valleys. The calm focus built through meditation heightens awareness, making each experience feel richer. The distant call of seabirds during a cliffside hike, the rustle of deer moving through forest brush, dolphins surfacing beside a kayak, or colorful parrots streaking across tropical skies. Wildlife encounters become sharper and more memorable because the mind is fully present rather than distracted by travel fatigue.

Food and drink experiences also deepen under this slower mental rhythm. Street food markets transform into sensory theaters where aromas, textures, and flavors register more vividly. A steaming bowl of noodles in a night market, freshly grilled seafood on a beach, mountain tea brewed over a small fire, or locally roasted coffee served in a village café all feel more layered and satisfying when approached with a centered mindset. Travelers often discover that meditation naturally encourages mindful eating, savoring meals instead of rushing through them between activities.

Saving money while practicing the meditation challenge becomes surprisingly easy. The habit promotes appreciation for simple experiences, sunrise viewpoints, public beaches, free hiking trails, local festivals, and neighborhood markets, reducing the urge to chase expensive attractions. Ten quiet minutes in a scenic park or at a scenic overlook often delivers more restoration than costly entertainment. Free or low-cost meditation apps provide guidance without subscription fees, and the practice requires no equipment beyond a quiet seat and willingness to pause.

Over time, meditation becomes a travel companion that strengthens endurance for long flights, patience during delays, and openness when navigating unfamiliar cultures. The traveler who meditates daily tends to notice small details others overlook. The rhythm of local street life, the patterns of migrating birds overhead, the changing color of evening light across distant mountains. Adventure remains intense, rafting rivers, climbing cliffs, diving reefs, but the mind moves with clarity instead of chaos.

The meditation challenge transforms travel into a more expansive experience, where physical exploration pairs with mental steadiness. Ten minutes each day becomes a quiet anchor in a constantly shifting world, helping travelers move through landscapes, cuisines, wildlife encounters, and cultural discoveries with a sense of balance that turns every journey into something deeper than distance covered.

Standing in front of a mirror telling myself ""I am enough"" or ""this too shall pass"" just felt silly. My inner critic would immediately jump in and say, *""Yeah right, you don't believe this stuff works, Ryan!"" 🗣️*

But lately, I’ve been trying a different approach to get over some mental humps. Instead of just *saying* the mantra in silence, I record it on my phone and mix it with genuinely inspiring, cinematic music that I can use to then start my day sitting alone or even walking down the street after coding/doing dev work at a coffee shop. 😎

My feelings are that something really cool (& weird! haha) happens when you hear your own voice blended into a powerful track. It stops sounding like ""me trying to convince myself"" and starts sounding like... truth and inspiration while also giving confidence in a cool way. The music carries the emotional weight that my voice is sometimes missing I feel. 😶‍🌫️

It’s become my go-to tool for bad days (and good days!). I just loop that 30-second clip (and recently been doing like 3 minute longer ones) of ""me and some music I chose"" until my brain actually starts to believe it -- or at least TAKE from it (whatever that was take-able in that moment; if that makes sense?).

Has anyone else tried using music w/ their voice to ""hack"" the emotional impact of their mindfulness practice(s), meditation or self-talk? Thanks in advance for any insight on my insight! haha :)",2,1771340479.0,Mindfulness,1,1.0,False
