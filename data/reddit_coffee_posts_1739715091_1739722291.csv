Hey r/roasting,

I‚Äôve been working on a **DIY drum coffee roaster**, inspired by [this Japanese guy‚Äôs build](https://youtu.be/cGYgEBjoE4A). He built an awesome little roaster by cutting aluminium sheet metal and screwing everything together, but he never shared the drawings. So, I figured‚Äîwhy not give it a shot myself and share them with the community?

I designed **2D CAD drawings** for all the external parts. The overall size is slightly smaller than the one in the video, but you can scale it up if needed. I haven‚Äôt cut the parts yet to test the fit, but I‚Äôm **pretty confident** everything will come together just fine.

# üîó Get the Drawings Here

üìÅ **GitHub Repository**: [**GitHub.com/mnabaci/CoffeeRoaster**](https://github.com/mnabaci/CoffeeRoaster)

This repo contains all the **DXF files** needed for laser cutting, along with build details.

# üìê What‚Äôs Inside?

* **Front.dxf** ‚Äì Front panel with holes for the bean charger and trier, plus an extra inner lid part.
* **Back.dxf** ‚Äì The back panel.
* **Top\_All.dxf** ‚Äì Three different design options for the top curve‚Äîpick what works best.
* **Chaff\_Tray.dxf** ‚Äì The tray to catch chaff under the roaster.
* **Misc.dxf** ‚Äì Various internal parts that go inside the drum.

# üõí Parts List & Where to Get Them

I‚Äôve already sourced most of the key parts needed to complete the build, including the **inner drum, bearings, hinges, and thermometers**.

Since Reddit sometimes flags posts with too many links, I‚Äôve included the **full parts list** (with links) in the **GitHub README** instead. If you're interested in building your own, you can find everything there!

# üí° Why I‚Äôm Sharing This

I love DIY coffee gear, and I know a lot of you do too. Since I couldn‚Äôt find open-source plans for a **laser-cut sheet metal coffee roaster**, I wanted to create and share them so others could build or improve on them.

Right now, I **can‚Äôt afford to get the sheet metal laser-cut**, but I‚Äôd love to bring this project to life. If you‚Äôd like to support the project, you can **buy me a coffee** here:

üëâ [**Buy Me a Coffee**](https://buymeacoffee.com/mnabaci)

No pressure‚Äîthis is just a fun project I wanted to share. If anyone ends up making one, I‚Äôd love to see how it turns out! üöÄ‚òï",1,1739721964.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

but seek the sun next time. i promised to buy you some flowers next time we met, it didn‚Äôt conjure. now the winter is over, i miss you. and you cried for me that night, i wiped the tear from your cheek. my t was wet cuz of your crying, but that‚Äôs how i like it. so never fucking mind.

fuck it though, i‚Äôm not good enough for you. you might relapse cuz of me. sometimes i wonder why i‚Äôm so toxic. it‚Äôs funny to see the trauma bonding, but the bitch in me won‚Äôt let it be. the blood in me is of demigods, ain‚Äôt my fault, i just hurt people like the cactus. ran through bangaluru just to get me some filter coffee, and it spilled on my sneakers.

but fuck a cactus, i buy you a whole garden next time. homeboy said you can‚Äôt just forget this one, it‚Äôs just gonna come back. but there‚Äôs a sense of peace living with regret. i close my eyes, look inside, stare in the mirror, ask shankara to stand by me. and then i look behind there‚Äôs an army of people guarding me, so i don‚Äôt worry too much.

but the visions are all fallacy. or maybe not but next time we are together ill buy you a garden.

We really had a blast - we truly loved each other deeply 

Met the family

Moved in together  

Discussed our future - the whole nine yards

It was our first attempt at love 

Of course we both made mistakes 

27 I discovered my internal demons - depression - anxiety you name it 

Neither of us truly understood why we were making these mistakes 

We were hurting each other 

We are both good people just a bit scared

At a certain point it became to much 

I became jealous and insecure 

Lost my trust in her 

She called it off and I don‚Äôt blame her 

She lashed out in pain - It hurt but I understood

I was a mess

Nothing could distract me - women - drinking - friends - travel  - sport - nothing could distract me enough 

I was a broken little boy tumbling uncontrollably through this washing machine called life

The world went dark all around me 

Like really dark 

Silence 

Quit dating - quit drinking - it helped 

I focussed on myself - spent lots of time alone 

I became really angry at the world around me - I saw injustices and fought them - it gave me meaning and felt like a productive outlet 

I became tough - hard from pain but soft on the inside 

Didn‚Äôt care about anything anymore

I could now see and feel others going through pain around me - I treat them gently 

Tried therapy - it helped

I could hardly recognise myself anymore

Every day I kept moving one step at a time

Moved from London to Italy

Career excelled  

Money problems almost disappeared

I‚Äôm no longer scared of much anymore 

Today she updated her profile picture with her new boyfriend

I study it carefully

She looks happy and I‚Äôm happy for her 

I feel relief, sadness and shed a tear as every thing comes flowing back 

I‚Äôm confused and numb again

I go for a walk - it helps 

Currently sitting in the sun processing my feelings whilst listening to Pyro - Kings of Leon

I smile at the waiter as he brings over my coffee - he returns a warm smile and I appreciate it 

I know it will be tough but I also know I‚Äôll be ok 

I buy a new shirt to feel better - it helps me picture a new future 

I‚Äôm glad she is happy 

One day I‚Äôll be happy again too 

I‚Äôll take my time

Keep on moving boys and girls 

Hope this helps someone

Recently roasted a Vietnam Lotus SHG from Bodileaf ( 13.6% loss)and waited 2 days to rest. Tasted like ass. Roasted another batch but darker (14.3% loss) because thats what some guidance had said. Waited 2 days, tried it, tasted like ass.

Roasted a Peru from HappyMug quite dark for my taste (14.7% loss) to bring out chocolate and nutty flavors. Waited 2 days, doesn‚Äôt taste like complete ass but still had a young/grassy taste to it.

Roasted a Kenyan Mochakos from HappyMug. Roasted pretty normal (13%ish loss), waited 2 days, tasted pretty darn good.

Roasted Ethiopian coffee (several yirgacheffe varieties) and made those super light (11-12% loss), waited 2 days, tasted fantastic.

What guidelines do you dudes use when it comes to degassing your roasted beans? By origin? By roast level? Its drivin me a bit crazy

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Started out eons ago with a Delonghi Pressurized espresso machine with pressurized portafilter, you had to pour the water in the top, screw on the lid and turn it on and wait 30 minutes for it to get hot enough to make 2 shots. If you wanted more you had to wait for it to cool down so you could unscrew the lid,, maybe. Lid was always sticking. The Tamp was the SPORK of the tamper work. Big Dosing Spoon on one end and plastic rounded face tamper on the other.

For example:

In the first few classes we learned:  
""I eat bread with butter.""

and

""I drink coffee and milk.""

  
And the teacher would ask us to change the end to other foods and drinks like:

""I eat bread with cheese"" or ""I eat cookies.""

  
Seeing as how powerful AI is right now, and how helpful it would be for language learning, I ask myself how interesting it would be, even beyond language learning, dynamic flashcards that can test you beyond fixed predefined flashcards. For exemple:

We would create a flashcard to memorize a fixed concept, but the powered AI would accept different (but still correct) types of answers.

Take the concept of ""Dog"":

We could say the dog is big or small. Brown, white or black. Barks at mail service worker or not always. But they all are a part of a scientific (not exactly fixed line) set of characteristics that we defined as dog. AI would understand, as far as I have tested, what these different types of answers are still correct.

We could also input audio instead of typing answers, make the LLM expand on something key aspect in-app etc.

Of course, since this is anki i would love a locally powered plugin. Which I realized I didn\`t even think to check and I\`m going to do it now.

I taught her and learned some swing dance moves together her first time doing so and started to crush hard. Didn't think I could control my emotions then, so I didn't try to ask for a date or anything.

A mutual friend then dated her for several months and broke up with her around Valentine's Day 2024. We've gone to group events together but never held a real conversation. She invited people through a social media story to come visit her at the coffe place she works at on this Valentine's, and I stopped by in the drive through to try a coffee. I don't like coffee, it was just to talk to her. Line was busy and I didn't say anything I wanted.  We said a few words through that social media afterwards, and after I said I had wanted to come and support her work at the business, she responded: ""Okay, well, I appreciate you stopping by."" 

Am I delusional or is that kind of a cold/ shutdown response? I don't think she assumes that I have a crush on her (and she doesn't show signs of really liking me). It sounds very cliche, but I've never even been ""in tha talking phase"" with anyone, and I don't know how to approach this situation. I'm going to graduate college soon and go who knows where and she still has a year or so left.

1iqv3nz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ostomy/comments/1iqv3nz/so_i_think_ive_cracked_the_ileostomy_output_code/,So I think I've cracked the Ileostomy output code...,"Been trying to figure out the output code here as to know when the best time to change a wafer as not to have the stoma constantly spewing. 

I do delay the small leak pain by washing my bag out with a little antibacterial soap and water, then leaving a little fresh mix up around the stoma to raise the pH level and thus deactivating the digestive enzymes attacking the skin. Plus I no longer drink coffee which causes diarrhea and the leak burns to far worse than normal.

So this has given me the benefit of time to evaluate if and when a wafer change can occur (along with a nice hot shower) without hardly any activity from Mr. SpewMaster screwing up the works.

So this is what I've found out.


1: NOT eating for awhile eventually clears the system of food output and then the body starts filling the bag with nothing but black gooey bile.

2: Eating some food that doesn't cause diarrhea will cause the bag to start filling up depending upon how much the body needs what your eating. If it's too much food or not the right kind, out it comes into the bag right away almost. Stuff it wants takes longer as it's absorbing it.

So the object I've found is to ideally have a meal after the black bile business, which likely one more dump of the black bile will occur as the body clears it out to deal with the new food that just came in.

So next will be of course the residue of the  non-dirarrea food and drink coming out and it will eventually decrease in volume until nothing fills the bag anymore. This is the time to watch out for and take the shower and wafer change then as the stoma will be quiet and trouble free.

But one doesn't want to wait too long or else hunger sets in and the black bile business gets started again.

Now what happens is I can be eating over the course of the day and thus the system gets backed up with stuff coming and going so it's harder to tell where one meal ends, so what I do is just wait it out for several hours until it calms down if it does or not. Why I stop eating anything big after 3pm as to allow the system to catch up and I can get in a hot shower and a wafer change before bedtime. Plus this way avoids a lot of the overloaded bag issues during the night, I just eat very small snacks as to avoid hunger after 3 pm.

However if I discover I have a small leak in the morning when I'm hungry, I'll go ahead and have a small breakfast to stop the black bile business spewing all the time and wait until the breakfast has cleared the system, the stoma will be calm and I can do the shower/wafer change.

So it seems non-dirarrea causing meals on an empty system and then waiting for it to clear gives the best opportunity to do a wafer change.

However anything that causes diarrhea then all bets are off. The thing just keeps spewing out of control until it is satisfied it's emptied the body of the poison or difficult to remove foods (leafy greens) one has put into their bodies. And it will keep on going the more one keeps putting that poison it considers it is back in, until one is out of bodily fluids and completely dehydrated which is a rather dangerous condition to be in.

So the laundry list of what foods, seasonings and drinks cause diarrhea (and gas, clogs and contispation) is quite lengthy. I suggest seeing an otosmy nutritionist or dietitian who should have a copy of this list in a guide.

Ileostomy Nutrition Therapy from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics

Without it I would say it would be rather difficult, because one wouldn't know if they ate something that causes diarrhea or not, so here they go ripping the wafer off and boom, it just starts spewing like gangbusters. One has to sit in the shower for hours until it calms down.

So anyway what's your tells that signal when it's a good time to change an Ileostomy wafer?",1,1739721109.0,ostomy,2,1.0,False

Identifying Quality Wine Through Aroma and Flavor Profiles
----------------------------------------------------------

When you're sipping on a glass of wine, the first thing you might notice is its aroma. Aromas can give you a hint of what to expect in terms of flavor and overall quality. High-quality wines often have more complex and refined aromas. You might pick up on floral notes, fruits, herbs, or even earthy undertones. These aromas are usually more pronounced and balanced. If the wine smells off‚Äîlike vinegar, cork, or mold‚Äîit‚Äôs likely a sign that something has gone wrong during the winemaking process or storage.

To truly appreciate the aroma, swirl the wine gently in the glass. This action helps release the volatile compounds that carry the scent. Take a moment to inhale deeply before taking a sip. This step can help you identify subtle nuances that might otherwise go unnoticed. For example, a young red wine might have a strong note of blackberry and vanilla, while an older red could have more earthy and leather-like aromas.

### Understanding Flavor Complexity

Flavor complexity is another key indicator of wine quality. High-quality wines tend to have a broader range of flavors that evolve as you sip. Start by identifying the primary fruit flavors. Common ones include berries, stone fruits, citrus, and tropical fruits. Next, look for secondary flavors like spices, oak, and herbs. These can add depth and character to the wine. tertiary flavors such as coffee, chocolate, and tobacco can indicate a wine that has been aged properly.

A wine that tastes simple or flat may lack these layers of complexity. For instance, a basic white wine might only have a straightforward lemon flavor, whereas a more complex one could also offer hints of honey and almond. Similarly, a robust red might start with dark cherry notes and then transition into a finish with hints of leather and tobacco.

#### Tasting Techniques

To fully appreciate the flavor profile, take small sips and let the wine linger in your mouth. Swirl it around to ensure it touches all parts of your tongue. This technique helps you detect different flavors and textures. Pay attention to how the wine changes as it mixes with saliva. Some wines might feel lighter and crisper, while others are fuller and richer.

*   **Initial Taste:**¬†Identify the initial burst of flavors. This is often the most prominent and can set expectations for the rest of the tasting.
    
*   **Middle Palate:**¬†Assess the evolving flavors as the wine sits in your mouth. Look for how the initial taste transitions and whether new flavors emerge.
    
*   **Finish:**¬†Notice the aftertaste. High-quality wines typically have a long and pleasant finish that lingers for several seconds.
    

##### Texture and Mouthfeel

Texture and mouthfeel are also crucial aspects of wine quality. High-quality wines often have a smooth, velvety texture. They can feel rich and full-bodied without being overly heavy. On the other hand, lower-quality wines might feel thin or watery. The texture can also indicate how the wine was aged. For example, wines aged in oak barrels might have a slightly creamy or buttery mouthfeel.

Pay attention to the tannins, which are compounds found in grape skins, stems, and seeds. Tannins contribute to the structure and aging potential of red wines. In high-quality reds, tannins are well-integrated and not harsh or astringent. They provide a pleasant drying sensation on the tongue, contributing to the overall balance of the wine.

Avoid wines that feel overly astringent or bitter. These characteristics can detract from the overall enjoyment of the wine. Instead, look for wines where the tannins are smooth and well-balanced with the fruit and acidity.

###### Balance and Acidity

Balance is essential in determining wine quality. A well-balanced wine harmonizes its components‚Äîfruit, acidity, tannins, and alcohol. Each element should complement the others rather than overpower them. Acidity is particularly important as it gives the wine freshness and prevents it from feeling flabby or dull.

High-quality wines typically have a crisp, refreshing acidity that enhances the fruit flavors. The acidity should be noticeable but not overwhelming. It should provide a clean, zesty edge that makes the wine lively and vibrant. Wines with low acidity can feel flat and uninteresting, lacking the zest needed to bring out the fruit flavors.

On the other hand, too much acidity can make the wine seem sour or sharp. It's all about finding the right equilibrium. For instance, a high-acid white wine like Sauvignon Blanc should have enough fruitiness to counterbalance the acidity. Similarly, a robust red like Cabernet Sauvignon should have sufficient tannins and fruit to handle its higher acidity levels.

Remember, the best way to develop your palate is through practice. Try tasting a variety of wines and pay close attention to their aromas and flavors. Over time, you'll become more adept at identifying the nuances that distinguish high-quality wines from those that are merely average. Whether you‚Äôre a casual drinker or a serious enthusiast, understanding these elements can significantly enhance your wine-tasting experience.

The Role of Vineyard Conditions in Determining Wine Quality
-----------------------------------------------------------

When evaluating the quality of a wine, one of the most critical factors to consider is the vineyard conditions where the grapes were grown. The environment in which grapes are cultivated significantly influences the final product, affecting everything from the grape's flavor and aroma to its acidity and tannin levels. Understanding how vineyard conditions impact wine quality can help you appreciate the craftsmanship behind each bottle.

**Terroir**, a term often used in the wine industry, encapsulates the unique combination of soil, climate, topography, and other environmental factors that contribute to the character of the grapes. Each of these elements plays a pivotal role in shaping the wine's quality:

### Vineyard Soil

The type of soil in a vineyard can dramatically affect the quality of the wine. Different soils retain heat and water differently, influencing the ripening process of the grapes. For example,¬†_chalky soils_¬†are known for their excellent drainage properties, which can stress the vines and lead to more concentrated flavors. In contrast,¬†_clay soils_¬†retain moisture and nutrients, promoting robust growth and potentially fuller-bodied wines.

#### Soil Composition

*   _Chalky Soils:_¬†These soils promote healthy root systems and can result in wines with higher acidity and elegance.
    
*   _Clay Soils:_¬†These retain moisture and nutrients, leading to richer, more full-bodied wines.
    
*   _Sandy Soils:_¬†Known for good drainage, these soils can stress the vines, resulting in more concentrated flavors.
    
*   _Loam Soils:_¬†A mix of clay, sand, and silt, these soils offer a balance between drainage and nutrient retention, ideal for balanced wines.
    

### Climate and Weather Patterns

The climate in which grapes are grown has a profound effect on the wine's character. Warm climates tend to produce riper grapes with higher sugar levels, leading to wines with fuller body and more alcohol. Cooler climates, on the other hand, preserve acidity and produce wines with more delicate flavors and aromas. Variations in weather patterns, such as rain, drought, and temperature fluctuations, can also influence the quality of the harvest.

#### Impact of Weather on Grape Quality

*   _Rainfall:_¬†Excessive rain can dilute the flavors of the grapes and increase the risk of diseases like mildew.
    
*   _Drought:_¬†Moderate drought stress can concentrate flavors but excessive drought can damage the vines.
    
*   _Temperature Fluctuations:_¬†Sudden changes in temperature can affect the ripening process and alter the grape's sugar and acid content.
    

### Topography and Altitude

The physical layout of the vineyard, including its altitude, slope, and orientation, can greatly influence the quality of the wine. Higher altitudes generally provide cooler temperatures, which can slow down the ripening process and enhance the wine‚Äôs complexity. Slopes can improve drainage and expose vines to better sunlight, while flatlands may retain more water and nutrients, potentially leading to less concentrated wines.

#### Altitude and Slope Effects

*   _High Altitudes:_¬†Cooler temperatures and increased UV exposure can enhance the wine‚Äôs aromatic profile and complexity.
    
*   _Sloped Terrain:_¬†Better drainage and exposure to sunlight can result in healthier vines and more flavorful grapes.
    
*   _Flat Terrain:_¬†Can retain more water and nutrients, potentially leading to less concentrated wines.
    

### Pruning and Vine Management Techniques

Even within the same vineyard, the way vines are pruned and managed can significantly impact the quality of the grapes. Proper pruning helps control the yield, ensuring that the vines focus their energy on producing high-quality fruit rather than excessive foliage. Techniques like¬†_canopy management_¬†can also improve air circulation and light exposure, reducing the risk of disease and enhancing the grape's development.

#### Pruning and Management Techniques

*   _Proper Pruning:_¬†Helps control yield and focuses vine energy on producing high-quality fruit.
    
*   _Canopy Management:_¬†Improves air circulation and light exposure, reducing disease risk and enhancing grape development.
    
*   _Leaf Removal:_¬†Allows better sunlight penetration and ventilation, contributing to healthier grapes.
    

The quality of wine is deeply intertwined with the vineyard conditions. From the type of soil and climate to the topography and vine management techniques, every aspect plays a crucial role in shaping the final product. By understanding these factors, you can gain a deeper appreciation for the artistry and science behind crafting exceptional wines. Whether you're a connoisseur or a casual drinker, recognizing the influence of vineyard conditions can elevate your wine tasting experience and help you make informed choices when selecting a bottle.

Decoding Wine Labels: What the Details Reveal About Quality
-----------------------------------------------------------

When you're navigating the aisles of a wine shop, deciphering the labels can feel like cracking a code. However, these labels aren't just decorative; they hold valuable clues about the quality of the wine inside. By understanding what each piece of information signifies, you can make more informed choices and elevate your wine tasting experience. Let‚Äôs dive into how you can decode wine labels to reveal the quality of the wine.

### **Understanding the Label Basics**

Start by examining the label for basic information such as the winery name, vintage year, grape variety, and region. These elements give you a foundational understanding of the wine‚Äôs origin and production process. For instance, a wine labeled with a specific vineyard name often indicates higher quality, as it suggests the grapes were sourced from a single, potentially superior location.

#### **Winery Name**

The winery name can be a key indicator of quality. Established wineries with a reputation for excellence typically invest in better grapes and more skilled winemaking processes. Look for names that resonate with quality, such as those recognized in wine competitions or known for consistent high ratings from critics.

#### **Vintage Year**

The vintage year refers to the year the grapes were harvested. Not all wines are vintage-dated, and for some varieties, the year can significantly impact the flavor profile. Generally, older vintages (within a reasonable range) tend to command higher prices and are often associated with better quality, though this isn‚Äôt always the case. Checking the average ratings and reviews for specific vintages can help you gauge their quality.

#### **Grape Variety**

Identifying the grape variety helps you understand the expected characteristics of the wine. Different grape varieties have distinct flavors, aromas, and textures. For example, Cabernet Sauvignon is known for its full-bodied structure and robust tannins, while Pinot Noir is lighter and more delicate. Knowing what to expect from a particular grape can guide your expectations and appreciation of the wine.

#### **Region**

The geographical origin of the wine can greatly influence its quality. Well-known regions like Bordeaux, Napa Valley, and Tuscany are renowned for producing high-quality wines due to their favorable climates and traditional winemaking practices. Lesser-known regions might offer excellent value, but it's important to research their reputations to ensure quality.

### **Appellations and Designations**

Look for designations that indicate stricter regulations and higher standards, such as Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC) in France or Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) in Italy. These designations often mean the wine adheres to stringent rules regarding grape sourcing, production methods, and alcohol levels, which can translate to higher quality.

#### **Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC)**

In France, AOC designation guarantees that the wine comes from a specific region and meets strict criteria for production. This includes limits on grape yields, minimum aging periods, and specific winemaking techniques. Wines bearing the AOC label are generally considered to be of higher quality.

#### **Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC)**

Italy‚Äôs DOC system ensures that wines come from defined geographic areas and follow regulated production methods. DOC wines are subject to rigorous testing, ensuring they meet quality standards. While not every DOC wine is exceptional, the designation does indicate a level of control and oversight that can enhance the likelihood of finding a high-quality bottle.

### **Production Methods and Aging**

Pay attention to how the wine was made and aged. Traditional methods, such as oak barrel aging, can add complexity and depth to the wine. Modern techniques, while innovative, may sometimes lack the nuance that comes from time-honored practices.

#### **Barrel Aging**

Many premium wines undergo barrel aging, which imparts flavors like vanilla, toast, and spice. This process also allows the wine to develop more complex layers of flavor over time. Check if the label mentions barrel aging, as this often correlates with higher quality.

#### **Fermentation Techniques**

Some labels specify fermentation techniques, such as whole cluster fermentation or carbonic maceration. These methods can significantly affect the wine‚Äôs character and are often employed by winemakers aiming for higher quality and uniqueness.

### **Quality Ratings and Reviews**

While not always present on the label, quality ratings and reviews from reputable sources can provide additional insights. Websites like Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast, and Robert Parker‚Äôs Wine Advocate offer detailed ratings and reviews that can help you gauge the overall quality of a wine.

#### **Professional Reviews**

Reading professional reviews can give you a sense of the wine‚Äôs balance, complexity, and aging potential. Even if a wine doesn‚Äôt carry a high rating, reading the critiques can help you decide if its style aligns with your preferences.

### **Price Point**

While price isn‚Äôt always an indicator of quality, it can be a useful metric when combined with other factors. Higher-priced wines often reflect the cost of production, aging, and marketing. However, don‚Äôt dismiss less expensive options; many affordable wines are excellent values and can be top-notch in their own right.

#### **Value for Money**

Consider the price relative to the wine‚Äôs quality. A wine that offers great value for its price point is often a smart choice. Look for recommendations from trusted sources that highlight both quality and affordability.

### **Final Thoughts**

Deciphering wine labels requires a bit of detective work, but it‚Äôs a skill that can greatly enhance your enjoyment and appreciation of wine. By paying attention to the winery name, vintage year, grape variety, region, appellations, production methods, and reviews, you can unlock the secrets hidden within the label. With practice, you‚Äôll become adept at identifying high-quality wines and making informed decisions that satisfy both your palate and your budget.

Understanding Wine Aging and Its Impact on Quality
--------------------------------------------------

When you pick up a bottle of wine, you might wonder how its age has influenced its taste and overall quality. Understanding the nuances of wine aging can help you appreciate the complexities and flavors that develop over time. Here‚Äôs a closer look at how aging affects wine and what to look for when evaluating a bottle's potential.

Firstly, it's important to know that not all wines benefit from aging. In fact, most wines are meant to be consumed within a few years of production. These wines are designed to be fresh and vibrant, offering immediate gratification. However, certain types of wines, particularly those with high tannins and acidity, can evolve beautifully with time in the cellar.

### Factors Influencing Wine Aging

*   **Type of Grape:**¬†Different grape varieties have varying abilities to age gracefully. For instance, Cabernet Sauvignon and Nebbiolo are known for their robust structure and high tannins, making them excellent candidates for aging.
    
*   **Region:**¬†The climate and soil conditions of a wine‚Äôs origin play a significant role. Cooler climates often result in wines with higher acidity, which can help them age longer.
    
*   **Production Techniques:**¬†Winemaking methods, such as extended maceration and oak barrel aging, can enhance a wine‚Äôs ability to age by introducing more tannins and complexity.
    

### How Aging Affects Wine

Aging allows wines to develop more complex flavors and aromas. As wines age, the tannins soften, and the fruit flavors may become more subtle, giving way to secondary and tertiary notes. These changes can transform a young, fruity wine into something much richer and more nuanced.

For example, a young red wine might be dominated by bright, primary fruit flavors like cherry or raspberry. Over time, these primary flavors can give way to earthy, spicy, or even mushroom-like notes, creating a layered experience that many wine enthusiasts find deeply satisfying.

#### Visual Cues of Age

Examining the color of a wine can also give clues about its age. Red wines tend to lose their vibrancy and deepen in color as they age, moving from bright ruby hues to brickish tones. White wines often start pale and bright, gradually turning to a deeper gold or amber.

##### Tasting Notes and Aging

The tasting notes of a wine can reveal a lot about its aging potential. Look for descriptors like ""tightly wound,"" ""closed,"" or ""backward,"" which suggest that the wine needs more time to open up. Conversely, if a wine is described as ""approachable"" or ""ready to drink,"" it likely won't benefit from further aging.

##### Deciding When to Open a Bottle

Knowing when to open a bottle of wine depends on several factors, including the type of wine, its vintage, and personal preference. Generally, wines with high acidity and tannin levels, like Bordeaux or Barolo, can age for decades. Meanwhile, lighter wines like Pinot Noir or Riesling are best enjoyed within a few years.

One effective way to gauge a wine's readiness is to decant it before serving. Decanting allows the wine to breathe, bringing out its full spectrum of flavors and aromas. If the wine opens up nicely after being decanted, it might still have some life left in it. However, if it tastes flat or lacks complexity, it might be past its prime.

##### Storage Conditions Matter

Proper storage is crucial for aging wine effectively. Keep your bottles in a cool, dark place with consistent temperature and humidity levels. Exposure to light, heat, and vibrations can accelerate oxidation and spoilage, ruining the potential of a fine wine.

Wine cellars or dedicated refrigerators designed for wine storage are ideal. If you don‚Äôt have access to these, a closet away from direct sunlight and with a stable temperature can suffice. It‚Äôs also helpful to store bottles on their side to keep the cork moist and prevent it from drying out.

##### Final Thoughts

Understanding wine aging requires patience and observation. By considering the type of grape, region, production techniques, and visual cues, you can better predict how a wine will evolve over time. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned collector or a casual drinker, knowing the impact of aging can elevate your appreciation of each sip.

Remember, the ultimate goal is to enjoy the wine at its peak, whether that‚Äôs immediately upon opening or after years of careful cellaring. With practice and experience, you‚Äôll develop a keen sense of when a wine is ready to be uncorked and savored.

The Importance of Winemaking Techniques in Assessing Wine Quality
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When evaluating a bottle of wine, it's crucial to consider the techniques used in winemaking. These techniques can significantly influence the final product's taste, aroma, and overall quality. Understanding these methods can help you appreciate why certain wines are considered superior to others.

One of the most fundamental aspects of winemaking is the choice of grape variety. Different grapes bring unique characteristics to the wine, such as flavor profiles and acidity levels. For instance, Cabernet Sauvignon is known for its full body and robust tannins, while Riesling offers a lighter, more delicate profile with high acidity. Winemakers must carefully select the right grape types based on the desired outcome for their wine.

### The Role of Terroir

**Terroir**, a French term, refers to the environmental conditions where grapes are grown, including soil type, climate, and topography. These factors contribute to the unique characteristics of the wine. For example, a Chardonnay grown in cooler climates like Burgundy might have higher acidity and flavors of green apple and citrus, whereas the same grape grown in warmer regions like California might produce a richer, more tropical fruit profile. Winemakers must understand and respect the terroir to harness these distinctive elements.

#### Fermentation Process

The fermentation process is another critical element in winemaking. Fermentation converts the sugar in grapes into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The duration and temperature of fermentation play a significant role in the wine‚Äôs character. For red wines, longer fermentation times and higher temperatures extract more color and tannins, resulting in bolder, more structured wines. White wines often undergo shorter fermentations at cooler temperatures to preserve their delicate aromas and flavors.

*   **Type of Yeast:**¬†Winemakers can choose between commercial yeast strains or indigenous yeasts found naturally on the grape skins. Commercial yeasts provide consistency and predictability, while native yeasts can add complexity and unique flavors.
    
*   **Controlled Fermentation:**¬†Some wineries use temperature-controlled tanks to manage fermentation precisely, ensuring optimal conditions for the yeast activity and preventing unwanted reactions.
    

##### Barrel Aging

Many premium wines undergo barrel aging, which imparts additional flavors and textures. Oak barrels are commonly used because they introduce subtle notes of vanilla, toast, and spice. The type of oak‚ÄîAmerican or French‚Äîand the age of the barrel affect the intensity of these flavors. New barrels impart stronger flavors, while older barrels allow the wine‚Äôs natural qualities to shine through more clearly.

*   **Duration:**¬†The length of time a wine spends in the barrel can vary widely. Some wines may spend only a few months, while others can age for several years, developing more complex flavors over time.
    
*   **Stainless Steel Tanks:**¬†Not all wines benefit from barrel aging. Some, particularly white wines, are aged in stainless steel tanks to retain their fresh, fruity characteristics.
    

### Vintage Variability

Vintage variability is another factor that affects wine quality. Each year presents different weather conditions that impact grape growth and harvest. A warm, dry year might produce riper grapes with higher sugar content, leading to fuller-bodied wines. Conversely, a cooler, wetter year could result in grapes with less sugar and higher acidity, producing lighter, more acidic wines. Experienced winemakers anticipate these variations and adjust their techniques accordingly to maintain consistent quality.

#### Bottling and Storage

The way a wine is bottled and stored also plays a role in its overall quality. Bottles with cork closures can sometimes suffer from cork taint, a flaw caused by a chemical reaction with the cork. Screw caps, on the other hand, offer a more consistent seal and prevent this issue. Proper storage conditions, such as maintaining a stable temperature and avoiding light exposure, ensure that the wine ages gracefully and develops its full potential.

*   **Cork vs. Screw Cap:**¬†While cork has traditionally been the preferred closure, many winemakers now opt for screw caps due to their reliability and ease of use.
    
*   **Storage Conditions:**¬†Storing wine in a cool, dark place helps preserve its integrity and prevents premature aging or spoilage.
    

##### Final Thoughts

Winemaking techniques are essential in determining the quality of a wine. From the selection of grape varieties to the fermentation process, barrel aging, and bottling methods, each step contributes to the final product. Understanding these techniques allows consumers to better appreciate the craftsmanship behind their favorite wines and make informed choices when selecting bottles to enjoy. By recognizing the importance of these processes, you can enhance your wine tasting experience and deepen your appreciation for this complex and nuanced beverage.

### Conclusion

Evaluating wine quality involves a blend of sensory analysis, understanding vineyard conditions, decoding labels, and recognizing the impact of aging and winemaking techniques. By paying attention to the aroma and flavor profiles, you can uncover the nuances that distinguish a well-crafted bottle. Knowing how vineyard conditions influence the grapes sets the foundation for appreciating the craftsmanship behind each label. Decoding these labels provides valuable information about the wine‚Äôs origin, age, and production methods, further aiding your assessment. Additionally, understanding how aging enhances complexity and how winemaking techniques shape the final product helps in making informed choices. Whether you're a seasoned connoisseur or a novice, these insights equip you with the tools to savor every sip, ensuring each bottle you choose is a delightful experience.",2,1739720903.0,SipCity,0,1.0,False

And all the rest seemed just not worth the time.  While I did try POF, Coffee meets bagel, and OKcupid.  They were just unsuccessful for me.  

So that left Eharmony with a steep price point. I am someone looking for a serious relationship.  So figured I‚Äôll give it 6 months and see what happens!  I read a lot of the reviews and not a lot of positives out there for a site that boasts its ability to really connect serious relationship lookers.   

First match was a scam! Right out of the gate! 
Second match we were having a nice conversation and the got removed for violating Eharmony‚Äôs Terns.  Not sure what they were doing else where but I felt or conversation was good. 
I had 4 more people I matched with that were also banned for terms violations before we messaged at all.  What sucked is I had already matched and lost matches. Which I still feel eharmony should refund you the match.  
Apparently they don‚Äôt. Which while I appreciate how active they are at monitoring their users, some of these scammers actually put convincing effort into their profile.  

In about 3 days I matched and used all 15 for the month. 5 were wasted on women that got banned and of the remaining 10. Only one I am still talking with after now 7 days on the app.  And have plans in the work to meet them. 

Only time well tell if the $220 I spent for 6 months was entirely worth it.  

Overall I would my experience on eharmony so far has been worth while.  Still getting a lot of likes.  But can‚Äôt match until next month. 

I really feel that things eharmony could do better are refund matches for banned profiles you matched with and allow a 24hr period before a match is used. Because most conversations don‚Äôt last more than 24hrs before people ghost out.  And I am stuck at the moment with 9 matches I‚Äôll probably not talk with again as they haven‚Äôt bothered to continue our conversation.  Which is totally ok with me!  I don‚Äôt expect to connect with every person I meet.  However losing a match for ghost is a little disappointing.  

There in-depth profiles are nice. I don‚Äôt really know how valuable there compatibility ratings  are. As most of the highest rated matches I had we don‚Äôt seem to match.  

Overall eharmony is expensive and that doesn‚Äôt mean better. Compared to all the other apps I have been on for me eharmony is working pretty well.  

I recommend people try a lot of the more affordable apps first.  Maybe you will do better than I did there and save some money first.  However if you are looking for a more serious relationship I do feel everyone I have met on eharmony so far shares that same desire as well.  Which is nice that I am in pool talking  with like minded women look to start a long term relationship.

Background: I started having a bad acid reflux in my late 20s and didn‚Äôt get proper treatment for it for probably a year or so. I‚Äôve had two nasty flareups over the past few years and in both cases, being on pantoprazole for a few weeks, helped me out. I did have an upper scope five years ago, and at that time, they did say I had gastritis and ulcers. They put me on sucralfate and Pantoprazole - and at my follow up a few months later they said it had gottten better. Fast forward to the present day, my reflux had been bothering me for a few months. I got another scope a few days ago, and the nurse showed me my scope pictures and said the stomach looked ‚Äúvery angry.‚Äù I could see in some of the pictures the stomach looked bright red. Dr asked me about my symptoms and said they took some biopsies to send off, and put me on Pantoprazole + peroxide at night, and said that I could take omeprazole in the middle of the day if I wanted to.

I have been reading up on gastritis and I‚Äôm really scared that this is going to be a case of atrophic gastritis, given that I‚Äôve had a few flareups over the years. How common is it for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù gastritis to progress to atrophic? Does anybody have experience with this? I have been tested for each pylori in the past and that was negative, I honestly think all of this started due to poor diet choices ‚Äì very acidic, lots of coffee on an empty stomach, etc. I‚Äôm a healthy weight and don‚Äôt smoke or drink, but I‚Äôm feeling really frustrated that my dietary choices probably led to this. And now I‚Äôm going down the rabbit hole reading about atrophic gastritis and its impact on long-term health.

I was fairly against it as I felt as though it was too soon, however I ultimately decided to do it to help her (she was managing a house by herself from a previous relationship, combined with the 1.5 hour drive distance between us)

We are about a month in and I feel smothered. For context, I drive her to and from work (and wait till she gets off) since she cannot drive, I also do all the household laundry, dishes, taking our (her) 2 dogs out and meal times, I also handle all of the household accounting/finances, well her only task is to cook and take inventory for groceries (which we do together). This is all on top of working 5-6 days per week.

In terms of quality time, we go to the gym for an hour 5 days a week, spend at least an hour every night going to bed together to watch a show/movie, coffee date every weekend, big date once a month. 

The issue in our relationship is that she feels as though this still isn't enough. I cannot go to dinner with my mom without her feeling left out. I cannot hang out with friends as she feels left out. I cannot do my own hobbies as my attention is divided from her and she cannot understand my hobbies/personal tasks. 

She has no friends and pretty much stopped doing all of her own hobbies. I'm trying to get her back into them to give myself some space, or show her clubs/resources to help her meet people; but so far she refuses. 

This has progressively getting worse to actually starting fights frequently. Our latest fight she pulled up a game she played (her only real hobby as of late) that has 51 hours logged in since moving in. She made it a big deal that I had 51 hours out of the month to do my own thing. Personally I don't view this as a lot given that I do more of the chores. She said it physically hurts when I don't give her attention. She says she craves it and feels like she needs to ask for my time; I feel like she isn't appreciating the time we do share together.

I‚Äôve been using the Krups Sensation EA910 for about 8 months, and while it‚Äôs a beautiful machine, it‚Äôs been a nightmare in terms of practicality. The funnel stopped directing coffee into the basket and instead started dumping it inside the machine. Over time, all the coffee got stuck inside, and the sensors stopped working entirely. The worst part? You can‚Äôt even access the inside to clean the funnel manually, Krups designed it that way.  

After this frustrating experience, I‚Äôve decided to return it and look for a better, more user-friendly fully automatic machine. I‚Äôm looking for one that allows easy access to the funnel for manual cleaning and it's not ugly. Budget is max 500e

1iqukcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1iqukcc/bit_of_a_breakthrough_this_morning/,Bit of a breakthrough this morning,"Had a date night last night. Kid staying over at a mate's house so we planned to go out drinking and get the bus home like the old days. I had been dreading it, not because I didn't want to go out - I did. But because I didn't want to face the rejection that would come with it.

It was a nice evening really. Didn't plan to initiate anything when we got home because my heart shatters every time I get rejected and get made to feel like a creep for craving my wife, but I was rejected in advance anyway with a tactical ""oh I'm soooo tired, looking forward to this early night..."" as we get off the bus before we even get through the door. I knew exactly what that comment was for and for some reason it hurt even more than if I'd tried and failed and it made me feel awful. We'd been surrounded by loved up couples all evening as well and it all just made me so miserable

Felt shitty and couldn't sleep so went to the spare room so I didn't keep her awake tossing and turning. Slept like garbage and looked like utter shit this morning, actually feeling scared to go back to our bedroom and get in our bed because I'd get turned on and didn't want to be rejected again, when I should at the very least have been enjoying a Sunday lie in without a kid jumping up and down on me.

She caught me with my head in my hands in the dining room when I went to get coffee and asked me what's wrong. That was the first breakthrough, she actually noticed I was in a state. Maybe because the child wasn't there stealing her attention, I dunno. I told her I'm miserable because I feel so lonely. She didn't understand how I could be lonely when I'm never alone. So I tried to explain that when the only person in the world you want to be with, and who you remember being so passionate with in the past rejects you over and over again for months on end it's heartbreaking and lonely. You feel like a loser who's fallen in love with his housemate and got friend zoned by them, and when you see other couples out and about looking loved up it feels like a kick in the balls. I said I just wished she wanted me as much as I want her, like she used to. 

Well I don't think she'd realised how badly this had hurt me and for such a long time. She was very much in the mind of ""this man and his stupid boners üôÑ why doesn't he just go have a wank if I'm not in the mood, I don't mind"" not understanding that I can get off any time I want, that's not what it's about, it's about being *with her* specifically. She also hadn't realised how long it had been. ""but we did it after that party we went to that wasn't that long ago"". That was in November last year and the time before that was June. ""was it???"" 

Now... I've no idea how she was that oblivious to how much she'd fucked me up. We have talked about it before many times but not in these terms (this sub helped me a lot with how to actually explain what I'm feeling so I appreciate every one of you). But we did end up doing the deed twice later in the morning so that was nice and unexpected. She actually put effort in for the first time in recent memory too. And she's said she's going to try harder not to make me feel like shit. So that's nice too. We'll see what happens... I'm sceptical it will improve long term because I've been burnt like this before but at least I feel a lot less shitty now than I did last night",11,1739719633.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

We live in a small town but with my family living about 35 minutes away, we decided I could move in to be closer to our college and support each other. I go to school full time and work part-time at a coffee shop to make money to support her and help her with buying school supplies and other necessities. She also works but she saves the money for other expenses. Recently, my truck had become damaged in an accident and her family was kind enough to let me use one of their cars for the time being. I really appreciate everything they do for me. 

Recently, my gf and I have been having many problems and have started fighting frequently. The source is that she‚Äôs envious of my major, biology, as she often compares herself as an education major. She often has talked with me about what would happen if we broken up but we find ways to make up. 

Today, we got into another fight and idk if I need to genuinely consider letting her be on her own as I am also getting affected as I can‚Äôt focus in school and feel horrible about even being in the major due to her side of the conversation. I‚Äôve offered to drop my major and study another subject but she tells me I shouldn‚Äôt, but I can‚Äôt help but feel I must if our relationship is to survive or grow. I‚Äôve tried talking with her and it sometimes goes nowhere and our vibe in this relationship has been tense. I also feel sad that if we did break up I would be out of a car and I also used up all of my savings to support our relationship. 

My family is also struggling after my mother had passed away about 2 years ago and things have become sad or even different at home after it happened. I‚Äôve supported her so wish she supported me, but I see that I‚Äôm causing her a lot of pain. But I also don‚Äôt have a car to get around to work, school and my other commitments that I can‚Äôt rely on my family for due to their conflicting schedules.

1. It's degrading to be expected to prove yourself or to impress your date

2. Males should invest in you BEFORE checking to see if there is any chemistry 

3. Its immature to not even invest in a $200 dinner date to get to know someone

Not long after the accusations were debunked by the woman who made them herself, I had a conversation with Akhromant, in which he poured his heart out to me.

He sits down in front of me, nursing the coffee in his hands, looking worn from the battle for his reputation. A deep seated intensity fuelled by a catastrophic choleric rage seems to imbue a face usually filled with Melancholy. We are at terraced cafe near the top of the Spanish Steps in Rome, the city which crushed millions of cultures under the fists of the New World Order, where the psy-op that is feminism was first spawned, and from here we can see the entire city in the rush of evening light, with towering marble monuments and the Catholic Church.¬†He talks to me about a time when a female supervisor (lovely and kind otherwise, he says. His willingness to speak highly of one who had wronged him so, is something others should take note of) said that his fist, resting on his leg, resembled a phallus. Akhromant was shocked at the moment by this inappropriate remark but kept quiet, thinking that it wasn't a big deal, but the image of a 5 tentacled phallus rocked him to his core. He pushed his discomfort down and continued writing the monthly financial report. Set down to carefully categorizing the morning onslaught of emails and drafted polite professional responses for the more overwhelmed accountants.¬†He went about his day as normal so to speak. But not long after another woman scorned joined in. She was coming back from the coffee machine, seemingly unassuming, but for bumping into his hand. Akhromant gasped. He felt violated. Not portending the injustice to follow, he walked up to the HR office. From the moment he stepped in, he could feel a chill. He sat down to file a HR complaint for sexual harassment and the rest is better left unsaid. In a tragic turn of events, no one could prove the allegatins. Akhromant was kicked out of his office for malicious accusations.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

At the start of last year, I could barely get out of bed to use the toilet or make myself food. I had to learn how to rest, and I still struggle with just lying down and doing nothing (doomscrollers gang, where you at?).

I‚Äôve noticed that when I finally feel safe enough to rest, my body sometimes brings up old memories I had suppressed so hard I didn‚Äôt even know they happened‚Äîlike CSA‚Ä¶ :/ It‚Äôs unsettling, and I think part of me avoids deep rest because of this.

Growing up, my mother always called me lazy, so I feel a lot of shame when I allow myself to just sleep. But I‚Äôm slowly letting go. At the same time, I‚Äôm scared that if I fully surrender to the fatigue, I‚Äôll completely ‚Äúlose it‚Äù and become a huge mess. To keep functioning, I‚Äôve been binging coffee and Ritalin, pretending I‚Äôm doing better than I actually am‚Äîbut that‚Äôs exhausting too.

I also had major sleeping problems in January because of old trauma resurfacing, so I took Seroquel/Quetiapine for a few weeks. I quit cold turkey, and ever since, I‚Äôve been so tired‚Äîspending 90% of my time in bed and haven‚Äôt hit the gym since. It feels nice and cozy to just let go, but it also feels like the more I embrace the exhaustion, the more it takes over.

So I‚Äôm wondering‚Äîhas anyone here fully given in to the burnout and fatigue? What happened? Did it help, or did you spiral even more?

I've been asking some california local friends questions, but thought I'd come to reddit for some answers too.



1) what is bikeability like in LA? We're very used to what is a relatively friendly biker city. Can we expect that to change? Are there good bike paths? Is there ample work for a bike mechanic?



2) in that same vein, what is public transit like? Can I expect relatively the same competency as I currently have, or expect a decline? I've heard very mixed reviews on this especially. I'm pretty used to being able to take the L wherever I need to be.



3) what area would you recommend? I've been told a few different things, so I'm just curious on more perspective. We're two queer people in our thirties, looking for a studio/ one bedroom and preferably trying to stay >$1300. Not picky at all really, I've lived in just about every part of Chicago. 



4) How is the job market for entry level positions, particularly in food service and most especially in coffee? That's been my trade for twelve years, so it's where I would prefer to stay if I can.



5) If you or anyone you know made a similar move- what were your barriers? What problems did you run into moving from Chicago to LA that you didn't expect? How did the CoL compare to what you were used to?


And lastly,



6) what are some of your favorite small, local coffee shops in LA? I'm planning to visit a couple times this summer and like I said, that's my bread and butter.

Finding that balance between hustle and heart can be tough in our fast-paced world. But there's one secret ingredient to enrich our lives that often gets overlooked: gratitude. Cultivating gratitude can transform the way you see the world and, in turn, how you experience it. Imagine turning everyday moments into a source of joy and building a life not just to live, but to love. Sounds amazing, right? Let‚Äôs dive into some easy ways to nurture gratitude every day and watch those dreams become reality.

üîç **1. Start a Gratitude Journal üìì**

There‚Äôs something magical about putting pen to paper. Begin each day, or wind down each night, by jotting down three things that made you grateful. They don‚Äôt have to be grand gestures‚Äîmaybe it's the taste of your morning coffee or a warm smile from a stranger. These small tokens of gratitude are like little seeds. Watch them bloom into renewed perspectives and brighter days.

üí° **Pro Tip:** For digital lovers, there are gratitude journal apps available! They‚Äôre perfect for capturing moments of gratitude on the go.

üåº **2. Mindful Moments with Nature üå≥**

Nature has a way of grounding us, bringing clarity and peace. Spend a few minutes each day outside, whether it's a walk in the park or simply sitting by a window, observing the world around. Notice the intricate beauty in leaves, the rhythm of the wind, or the colors of a sunset. Let nature remind you that beauty is everywhere and tap into that gratitude.

üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **3. Practice Acts of Kindness üíñ**

A simple act of kindness can ripple into waves of gratitude. Offer a compliment, help a friend, or even smile at a stranger. Kindness boosts both the giver and the receiver, creating a cycle of positive energy and gratitude. Watch how these small gestures transform your day and the days of those around you.

üéØ **4. Reflect on Challenges as Lessons üìà**

Life‚Äôs challenges often disguise themselves as failures or setbacks, but they are often our greatest teachers. Reflecting on these experiences and what they‚Äôve taught you can radically shift your perspective‚Äîturning obstacles into stepping stones. By embracing challenges with gratitude, you're empowered to grow stronger and wiser.

üé∂ **5. Celebrate Tiny Wins ü•≥**

Too often, we overlook small victories in pursuit of larger goals. But, every success‚Äîbig or small‚Äîdeserves recognition. Did you drink more water today? Finish that long-overdue task? Celebrate it! Acknowledge and appreciate these wins to keep motivation high and gratitude flowing.

---

Empowish community, by incorporating these practices into your daily routine, you‚Äôll start to see an uplift in your mood and clarity in your purpose. Gratitude is more than a fleeting feeling; it‚Äôs a powerful force that can change your life‚Äôs direction.

*""Five more minutes, please‚Ä¶""* I mumbled, burying my face into the pillow.

The clock rang again.

*""Oh my god, just stop! I'm waking up!""*

Groggily, I forced myself up, still exhausted from yesterday‚Äôs work. My body ached, my mind foggy. What I would give to sit in a cockpit again‚Ä¶ At least then, only one person would detest being around me.

Stomach rumbling, I trudged out of my room and into the cramped but livable living room. I opened the fridge, expecting something edible, only to remember‚Äîright. Work had kept me too busy to buy food.

*""Fuck myself.""*

With a resigned sigh, I settled for the next best thing‚Äîthree cups of coffee, just enough to take the edge off.

As I took the first bitter sip, the front door creaked open. I looked up and saw Kate‚Äîmy ever-sneaky assistant‚Äîtrying (and failing) to slip inside unnoticed. Unfortunately for her, she had three plastic bags full of food.

*God, I hate this woman.*

""Hi, Lucius,"" she said, flashing a guilty smile. ""I was hoping to surprise you with breakfast, but, uh‚Ä¶ surprisingly, you didn‚Äôt destroy your alarm clock this time.""

‚ÄúWell, I gotta make a very impressive first impression today,"" I muttered, rubbing my eyes. ""Seeing as I‚Äôm about to meet some ‚Äòimportant‚Äô people.‚Äù

I paused.

""Couldn‚Äôt I just send Ethan to deal with this?""

""Unfortunately, as important as Ethan is, this whole thing was your idea‚Äîso yeah, this is on you,"" Kate said with a grin.

""Why do you make it sound like that's a bad thing?"" I countered, stretching. ""It got people to stop killing each other. That‚Äôs a win, right?""

Kate raised an eyebrow. ""You dropped bombs on a burning St. Petersburg.""

I scoffed. ""Tactical strikes.""

""On civilians.""

""I didn‚Äôt have a choice."" My voice was quieter now. ""We were losing the city. If I hadn‚Äôt‚Ä¶"" I trailed off, jaw tightening. ""I saved more than I killed.""

Kate studied me for a moment before sighing. ""Uh-huh. Keep telling yourself that, Lucifer.""

""Fuck you, Kate.""

""Whatever you say, Demon Lord."" She smirked.

I rolled my eyes as she carried the groceries into the kitchen.

""I'm gonna make you something that *isn‚Äôt* concentrated caffeine,"" she called over her shoulder. ""How about you go take a shower, flyboy?""

""Roger that, boss,"" I said, draining the last of my coffee.

Cleaned up and dressed, I adjusted the collar of my coat, staring at my reflection in the mirror. Even looking professional, I still looked exhausted‚Äîlike a man who hadn‚Äôt slept properly in years.

Maybe because I hadn‚Äôt.

I leaned against the counter, rubbing the bridge of my nose. Through the window, the city stretched out before me. The skyline still bore the scars of war‚Äîcollapsed buildings, empty districts still waiting to be rebuilt.

Today was *the* day. The culmination of everything Ethan and I had worked toward. I should have felt proud, accomplished even, but all I could focus on was the dull weight in my chest.

I didn‚Äôt want to see those people.

Most of them had hidden away during the war, holed up in bunkers and distant fortresses, watching from the sidelines while people like me had to fight‚Äîwhile people like me *died.* They called themselves leaders, but the only thing they had ever truly commanded was their own safety.

And now, they got to sit at the table and decide the future?

I exhaled sharply, pushing the thought away. *No. Keep it in check.*

All those old grudges, all the bitterness‚ÄîI had to bury them. Ethan and I had spent years dragging this shattered world toward something better, and today was proof that we‚Äôd succeeded.

It wasn‚Äôt about me. It was about making sure this future lasted.

""Are you monologuing inside your head again?""

Kate‚Äôs voice cut through my thoughts, and I turned to find her leaning against the doorway, arms crossed, amusement written all over her face.

I blinked. ""What?""

""You know, thinking isn‚Äôt exactly silent with you. I could hear your entire evil villain speech about world domination from here.""

""It‚Äôs not like that!"" I scoffed, shaking my head. ""I was just‚Ä¶ thinking. What we‚Äôve done‚Äîit feels unreal. Too idealistic. Too na√Øve."" My voice dropped. ""And yet, we made it work.""

Kate smirked. ""Yeah, funny how people change when they‚Äôve lost everything. You‚Äôd think war would just make everyone more hateful, but I guess even the most stubborn bastards hit a breaking point.""

She wasn‚Äôt wrong.

Entire families wiped out. Fathers mourning their sons. Children who would grow up never knowing their parents. And the Ural Mountains‚Ä¶ *Gods help us.* The self-destruction of that entire region had been one of the last desperate acts of a fractured world. To put a border of cobalt around it, to preserve of what remains of the Tsardom. Millions of lives, erased in an instant.

People had enough of that.

""This working means people finally decided to let go of their differences,"" she continued, her voice softer now.

I let out a dry laugh. ""That, or they‚Äôre just too tired to keep burying their dead.""

Kate didn‚Äôt argue.

A silence stretched between us. I glanced at my hands, tracing an old scar across my knuckles. A memory flickered‚ÄîEthan and I, years ago, flying above the ruins of a bombed-out city, making plans. His voice, full of fire and certainty, saying, *‚ÄòOne day, we won‚Äôt have to fight anymore. One day, we‚Äôll actually live.‚Äô*

And now, here we were.

""You sure you're ready for this?"" Kate asked.

I forced a grin. ""I have no choice, do I?""

She chuckled. ""Nope. Now hurry up and get your ass moving, flyboy. If you show up looking like a sleep-deprived gremlin, I‚Äôm not covering for you.""

I smirked. She would, though.

With a mock salute, I turned toward the door. ""Aye aye, captain.""

Kate shook her head, watching me go. ""Try not to cause an international incident before lunch, will you?""

*No promises.*

Sitting in the back of the car, I stared out the window, watching the ruins of the old world blur past. My mind raced, turning over possible opening words.

*Don‚Äôt say something stupid. These people are here to help you, not sabotage everything you‚Äôve built.*

The GPS chimed‚Äî500 meters away. The new Assembly.

It still looked unfinished, rushed into existence like everything else in this so-called new era. Just slabs of concrete stacked together, standing more out of necessity than design. But who was I to judge? I used to blow buildings like that sky-high.

Back then, Ethan and I kept score‚Äîhow many structures we destroyed, how many targets we ""neutralized."" Whoever had the highest count won. He‚Äôd usually end up owing me by the end of the month.

Now, I was about to walk into a room full of people whose buildings I‚Äôd reduced to rubble.

Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt think back on those memories too fondly.

""Alright, flyboy. Time to dance on the roundtable,"" Kate said, breaking my thoughts.

I scoffed. ""A7R had far friendlier guys than the ones I‚Äôm about to meet. At least the pilots there had the decency to say hi.""

""Stop complaining, Lucius. Ethan‚Äôs waiting for you near the halls. Tell him I said hi.""

I sighed, leaning back against the seat. ""Thanks for the escort, Kate. If you see my condo explode, that means I screwed up.""

Kate smirked. ""Then try not to screw up, flyboy.""

I stepped out of the car, my boots hitting the pavement with more force than intended. I swallowed, rolling his shoulders to shake off the tension, but my pulse was already hammering.

The Assembly loomed ahead‚Äîtall, grey, and unfinished-looking, like everything in this new era. Every step toward it made his nerves buzz, a strange mix of anticipation and pressure coiling in my chest. Hands twitched at my sides, itching for something‚ÄîThe yoke, a cockpit console, anything familiar. Instead I clenched my fists and kept walking.

The halls were too quiet. The air was cold, the kind that seeped into my skin. Each footstep echoed just a little too loudly.

*Relax. Act like you belong here.*

I forced my breath steady. I should be excited‚Äîthis was the moment, the culmination of everything Me and Ethan had fought for. But excitement and anxiety blurred together, making it impossible to tell if his heart was racing from anticipation or outright panic.

My palms felt damp. I wiped them against his coat.

A sharp inhale. A glance ahead.

There. Just beyond the double doors, standing near the entrance to the hall‚ÄîEthan.

My chest tightened. This is real. This is happening.

I exhaled sharply, steeling himself. And then, with a final push forward, he walked inside.

My boots echoed through the lobby, greeting the guards, ‚ÄúHello Sir Solberg, come, your friends are waiting for you.‚Äù

Friends, hopefully to the near future I‚Äôd able to make myself call them that, walking towards the hall I saw Ethan, finally someone to calm my Nerves. ‚ÄúYo buddy, still alive? You look like shit. I‚Äôm pretty sure I saw you look better at the siege of Volgograd‚Äù Ethan said with a slight smirk. ‚ÄúYou have no idea how much my heart is pumping. I don‚Äôt know if this is due to the amount of caffeine I‚Äôve consumed or just pure adrenaline‚Äù I said with deep breaths.

‚ÄúI feel the same buddy but we‚Äôve both faced things that are far more scarier than that. Come a lot of people would like to see the face of the writer of the new Constitutional Charter‚Äù. Ethan said with slight pride.

I walked past the doors and see the emblem of the United Nations made from old steel, I felt time come to a slow pace. I walked with every step feeling like I was weighed 10 tons.

Applause greeted me as I walked past the multiple panels of people. As I stepped through the center of the Auditorium, I felt the world was watching me. I felt as if they‚Äôre waiting for me to slip up. *Don‚Äôt let that kind of thinking get into you, stay sharp Lucius.*

I exhaled sharply, scanning the room. Hundreds of people, all waiting, all expecting something. No pressure.

**""Fifteen years ago, the world ended. Not in a poetic, slow-decline kind of way. No‚Äîour world burned. Cities vanished, nations crumbled, and everything we thought was permanent turned to dust. We fought, we killed, we justified it to ourselves because we thought we had no other choice.**

**And yet, here we are. Somehow, against all odds, we survived.**

**We survived not because we were the strongest, or the smartest, or even the most deserving. We survived because when everything collapsed, some of us made a choice‚Äînot to keep fighting, but to stop. To pick up the pieces instead of throwing more into the fire.**

**This Constitutional Charter‚Äîthe one we sign today‚Äîis not a magic solution. It won‚Äôt erase what we‚Äôve done. It won‚Äôt make the past less painful, and it sure as hell won‚Äôt make the future easy. But it does something far more important: it gives us a place to start.**

**With the formation of the United Nations Parliament, we are doing what should have been done long ago‚Äîgiving every nation, every voice, a seat at the table. No more power struggles behind closed doors, no more backroom deals deciding the fate of billions. If we‚Äôre going to screw things up, we‚Äôre at least going to do it** ***together*** **this time.**

**I know some of you look at me and see a soldier. Some of you look at me and see a war criminal. Fair enough. I won‚Äôt stand here and pretend my hands are clean. But I also won‚Äôt stand here and pretend that going back to the way things were is an option.**

**War got us here. It‚Äôs not going to get us out.**

**So today, we choose something different. Today, we take the first step toward a world where our greatest battles are fought** ***in this room***\*\*‚Äîwith words, diplomacy, and the occasional bureaucratic nightmare. A world where we argue, debate, and compromise\*\* ***before*** **we reach for the missiles.**

**It‚Äôs not going to be perfect. We will argue, we will make mistakes, and some of us will probably drink too much trying to deal with it. But the fact that we are here‚Äîthat we have** ***chosen*** **to build instead of destroy‚Äîproves that we are capable of something more than war.**

**We are capable of peace.**

**So let this be our first step. Not toward some naive fantasy, not toward some utopian dream‚Äîbut toward something real. Toward something worth fighting for.**

**And to those who look upon us now‚Äîfrom the ruins of old nations to the generations yet unborn‚Äîlet them see that on this day, humanity chose to stand together.**

**Let this be our legacy.**

**And let this be our** ***first step into the future.*****""**

Thousands of people applaud, I didn‚Äôt know if it was genuine or not but at this point I didn‚Äôt care, this is biggest step that the world could achieve.

I stood there still with heart pumping and saw Ethan smiling, I never saw him smile so brightly.

‚ÄúWell then‚Äù Ethan spoke, ‚ÄúDoing pretty good at first day of the job, every member nation or what‚Äôs left of those nations have signed the charter.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood, this wouldn‚Äôt just benefit them but the world would.‚Äù I spoke professionally. ‚ÄúCome with me Lucius, let me show you where you‚Äôre ass is gonna sit.‚Äù Ethan spoke.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

‚ÄúWell, here‚Äôs the room. It‚Äôs not as big as the Oval Office, but you‚Äôre used to claustrophobic spaces, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Ethan quipped, a smirk tugging at his lips.

‚ÄúIt certainly beats a cockpit,‚Äù I replied, running a hand over the polished surface of the desk.

Ethan let out a short chuckle. ‚ÄúWell then, I should leave you to it. Your second-in-command shouldn‚Äôt be lounging around too much‚Äîthere are plenty more humanitarian trips calling my name.‚Äù He stretched, rolling his shoulders dramatically. ‚ÄúYou know, because we didn‚Äôt just save the world or anything.‚Äù

I scoffed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt push yourself too hard, Ethan. We did a lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, and we‚Äôve still got a lot left to do.‚Äù He paused at the doorway, his expression shifting just slightly‚Äîsomething more serious, more knowing. ‚ÄúBut hey, if anyone can make this work, it‚Äôs you.‚Äù

I huffed out a quiet laugh, shaking my head. ‚ÄúGod help us all, then.‚Äù

Ethan grinned. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt screw this up, Lucius.‚Äù

I waved him off as he disappeared down the hall, leaving me alone in the dimly lit office.

For a moment, I just stood there, staring at the chair‚Äîthe symbol of what I had become. The room felt suffocating, even more than a cockpit, even more than a battlefield. Out there, I knew the rules. In here? The only enemy was the weight of the world itself.

With a slow breath, I stepped forward and sat down, fingers tapping against the desk. Outside the window, the sun was just beginning to set, casting long shadows over the city‚Äîthe first capital of the new world.

A new era. A new beginning.

I leaned back, exhaling sharply.

Alright, let‚Äôs see if we can keep this thing in the air.

Seeing the Charter on my desk, All 193 nations signed it but only one left blank remaining. My signature.

Well then, wasted 8 years of my life for this but finally this would all be worth it.

- I was under the impression that free food means you can eat as much. does this apply only to buffet? e.g. if being served, can you order multiple appetizer/mains? 

- I don't want to waste food but do want to try out everything and you have to book the dining rooms so can't visit as often

- e.g. on Virgin where all the specialty dining is included and a big perk, it turns out you can only visit each of them once only

- As a solo, NCL is recommended. but with their 'more at sea' I get ONE free special dining meal on a 7 day cruise ??!! out of 14? what kind of 'deal' is that

- its impossible to get an idea of quality and variety. there are reviews saying exact opposite of each other and praising every cruise line/ship

- why is an unlimited drinks package $60-100? obviously because its where they make the money, but still. a normal person would drink maybe 4-5 alcoholic drinks, those have a food cost of perhaps $1-2 each, coffee/soda is pennies

- is coffee/soda with refills included in the 3 regular meals or do you have to pay extra for that too?

- can you take food to go, to eat later?

I'm vegetarian and most of them seem to cater quite well, but it could mean 1 veg entree choice or it could mean a whole dedicated station/restaurant. 

I understand you can not spend anything extra, just eat at the buffet/main dining areas, don't drink etc. 
How many people do that? Honestly I think that might be enough, but I'd like to be able to order an espresso or a drink at night and try different foods and just relax without worrying about costs.

Room service also used to be free but isn't. That isn't a big factor as I don't want to spend time in the room but the constant nickel and diming while their profits go up is too much. Same for included tips.

It seems only the luxury cruise lines have actual unlimited all inclusive dining/drinks, whereas its common in all inclusive resorts at similar price points to the main cruises. Is food on a ship that much better?",0,1739716950.0,Cruise,13,0.5,False
1iqtm3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/1iqtm3e/im_about_to_miss_out_on_the_possibility_of_the/,I'm about to miss out on the possibility of the right person because of my job,"Hello friend. This is going to be quite long. A little background about my situation. I moved to Japan a few years ago with my now ex-girlfriend. We both had the idea of starting a life abroad but it didn't work out for us. That just shows a little bit about the type of person I am. I would say I'm quite spontaneous and a bit of a romantic. I moved to a different city in the country because of my job and I was completely alone. I had no relatives or friends and it was quite tough. The breakup was pretty fresh and I was pretty lost in life. Moving to a different country for someone you wont end up with can leave you feeling like this. I was also lacking a lot of self-confidence during this time and was kind of obese. 

I told myself that I need to learn to live and love this place so I started with myself. I decided to eat healthy and treat my life here as if it was a movie. Getting to move to Japan is no easy feat and I didn't want to take for granted what I have. After 3-4 months it got better for me. I was healthier and more confident but I was still feeling a bit lonely. A bunch of my friends from my home country suggested that I should try dating around and try all sorts of dating apps. It wasn't for me. Although I have completely moved on from my previous relationship, it wasn't in my personality to date around. I did however wanted to make a friend. Since I was trying to learn the language I decided to use those language exchange apps to make a friend. It still wasn't easy haha. Eventually I got to talking with this one person and we decided to meet up for coffee. 

Now I'm going to be completely honest. I did not know what this person looked like until before agreeing to meet with her. But yeah, she was beautiful. Before moving to Japan I've been here as a tourist more than 4 times, and I've been to about 10 cities or like 3-5 prefectures ((this is not completely accurate but I've been to a lot of places)). She was the most beautiful person I've ever seen. I'm just aware of this, in my head I really wanted a friend. Let's call her Autumn. When we went out for coffee, it was one of those situations where I expected it would be quite awkward or difficult for us to communicate but we spoke enough of each other's language to not have problems talking. In fact, it felt like I met someone who I didn't really need to translate what my soul was trying to say. It felt natural. We walked around the city after, took photos, had fun banter. I eventually had to take her to a restaurant where she was meeting with her friend. She asked to exchange contact infos before saying good bye. I was pretty happy because I finally met a friend in the city. 

Our first conversations became more frequent and we actually met up immediately after just a few days. Whenever I mention something I would want to try, she would set up plans for me to try these things. From restaurants, places, views, she would make sure I get to try all of them. She wanted me to make plenty of memories in the city and I felt really lucky to meet a friend like her. My boring weekdays in my job became a lot more colorful when she came into my life. I would write down all of my experiences with her but there were too many. I eventually wanted to show my gratitude and got her a gift for Christmas which she said really made her happy. During Christmas I had to come home to my country so I left her a surprise before I left. When I came back I was a lot more aware of how I feel about her. I eventually even cooked for her. 

I'm kind of jumping timelines a bit because it's honestly too long but the sad part is eventually about to come. My job eventually told me they have to relocate me out of the prefecture by the end of the March. I felt my world shatter. I eventually had to tell her about this and asked her what she would want me to do. She said I should quit from my current company and look for another job in the city. She wanted me to stay. I asked her for how long and she said forever.

Once Valentines happened I got her flowers and she got me chocolates and we went out and had nice time together. After this day I realized that I've completely and head over heels fallen for this person. And now this coming week I have 2 job interviews left and it'll determine whether I will be able to stay in this city or not. I can't be unemployed because I'm a foreigner in this country. I'm scared of missing out on what could possibly be the best thing that can ever happen to my life. And it's been so heavy. Thank you for listening friend.",3,1739716940.0,lifeinapost,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs been years since I last had a structured plan designed by somebody else, so this was a big change for me.

The biggest win? The mental relief. Having everything planned out - grocery lists, meals, portioning - made my life so much easier. I didn‚Äôt have to constantly think about what to eat, and I wasn‚Äôt randomly snacking because the meals were well-timed. The plan also had me cooking a few portions at the same time, it helped with decreasing the mental load, too. I also felt like, for the first time, I was actually eating balanced meals. I tracked everything in MyFitnessPal, and I was hitting my macros effortlessly.

One unexpected bonus was fiber intake. I‚Äôve been trying to increase it for a while, but only now did it happen naturally without me even trying. My body is still adjusting, but I can already tell the difference. Also, the food was actually *good* \- not weird ""diet food,"" just normal, tasty meals. My favorites this week were cinnamon granola and a roasted potato salad. Another big plus? No obscure ingredients, and everything was used up completely, so no waste.

I also learned a few things about my preferences. Texture matters to me *a lot* \- I followed the recipes exactly this week and realized that oatmeal with orange is just not for me (switching to berries next time). Some low-calorie swaps also don‚Äôt work for me - if I‚Äôm making a cheesy tortilla, I *want* real cheese. The plan used mozzarella, but the next day, I swapped it for regular cheddar, and I have zero regrets. Oh, and rye bread as toast? Not my thing.

I know I have the privilege of working from home, which makes it easier to stick to this meal plan - shakshuka for breakfast on Friday? That wouldn't have been doable back in the office days. That‚Äôs definitely an advantage, but I still appreciate how well this plan fits into daily life.

I technically need 1700-1800 kcal to stay in a deficit, but I picked the 1600 kcal plan to leave room for my daily coffee with milk and sugar (70 kcal, and I refuse to compromise - I've tried sweeteners, plant-based milk, black coffee‚Ä¶ not worth it) and the occasional Milky Way.

I know there‚Äôs a bit of a novelty effect at play here, but for now, it‚Äôs working, and I see it as an opportunity to educate myself about nutrition. Overall, I‚Äôm really happy with how this week went. Having a set meal plan took away so much of the stress around food, and it felt sustainable.",0,1739716879.0,loseit,0,0.5,False

Almost like going off tangent with the topic to start another topic,but it‚Äôs still kind of adjacent to what is being discussed.
Example: (I started this conversation in the first place)

Person A: talking about cold foam on coffee 

Me: oh yea. Milk foam on bubble tea is really good. *proceeds to go on tangent about that*

It‚Äôs almost like I get more interest talking about this other new adjacent thing instead of what we were currently talking about.  I understand bridging between discussions points is normal but most times I feel like it tends to disrupt the flow of the conversation bc it feels too soon or something üòÖ
It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt keep on topic for the adequate amount of time. 

In addition sometimes I‚Äôll take it a step further and create almost full convo bits with myself. Basically talking to myself, Because I think it would be funny to play out.

I just wanted to share my tips for those wanting to do their own.

1. Everything is in alphabetical order, but instead of running left to right, it runs left then the next row up runs right to left, which makes filing things away more efficient as  you don't have to run all the way to the left again (although this may be me just wanting to put things away in order üòÇ) I used the right signpost, crafted from the workbench and placed at the end of the rows to show me the direction (just flip for left arrow üòÇ)
2. These lists have all the current items from the main game and the DLC.  I will share my lists below, so you can copy and put into your own spreadsheets üòÅthe marshmellows have their own special place so I haven't included them on these lists.
3. When laying out the wardrobes **horizontally**, I placed them all in a line with no gaps, and then removed one, so there should be a one wardrobe gap in between two, for access and to place the tables (see image)
4. When laying out the wardrobes **vertically**, I placed one of the wardrobes sideways between the rows, which I found was the perfect size to get past easily but keep it tight so I could fit more in! (see image)
5. Any constructive feedback welcomed, can always improve and make things more efficient ‚ù§Ô∏è

I watch 24*7 five year old and almost two year old 
We were all up by seven am saw wife off to work down the mountain
Daughter five year old back to sleep until maybe nine thirty? She still bottle nipple feeds we on nido 5+
Two year old was awake al the way until eleven thirty where upon he slept off in the tricicad until like 4 pm?
Drank his enfagrow at 11 30 with add on at 1 pm of 3oz and another bottle of 4 oz by three thirty four
And now ten thirty after a poop at six thirty and food eating more or less every two bottles 
He's gone off in my lap as I'm typing this
But about half an hour back he whacked me palm in face because I'd given the tablet back to his sister when she went to get my phone

Yes we arent big fan of gadgets most of the time and we also don't restrict because honestly they pretty much self regulate on their own and eat and drink properly as much as they can lol..

I lost it and half head whacked him with my closed fist ..I know it was controlled but still..I'm at a loss how to control my impulse 

I can no longer sleep when he goes down since he basically spent most of his time on my shoulder since he has this on and off cough
.I do give him a puff once a day of the inhaler with a spacer..
I deal with them the whole day more of less even when wife comes home from thirty six hour shifts
I game myself and gauge my tiredness pretty much throughout the day
Space my coffee or Ovaltine or milo.best I can

Also poop more or less when I can and even take two year old with me to the bathroom so that he won't acream abandonment outside

There's no relief team .wife blames me for having no job and failing my exams to qua lol ify to work after two three years as a doctor in India 
As I'm typing this I'm wondering if asking or even sharing the run down of this day is going to backfire in me and have judgement 

I dunno what to say barely know what to do

1iqtf5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1iqtf5d/im_about_to_miss_out_on_the_possibility_of_the/,I'm about to miss out on the possibility of the right person because of my job,"Hello friend. This is going to be quite long. A little background about my situation. I moved to Japan a few years ago with my now ex-girlfriend. We both had the idea of starting a life abroad but it didn't work out for us. That just shows a little bit about the type of person I am. I would say I'm quite spontaneous and a bit of a romantic. I moved to a different city in the country because of my job and I was completely alone. I had no relatives or friends and it was quite tough. The breakup was pretty fresh and I was pretty lost in life. Moving to a different country for someone you wont end up with can leave you feeling like this. I was also lacking a lot of self-confidence during this time and was kind of obese. 

I told myself that I need to learn to live and love this place so I started with myself. I decided to eat healthy and treat my life here as if it was a movie. Getting to move to Japan is no easy feat and I didn't want to take for granted what I have. After 3-4 months it got better for me. I was healthier and more confident but I was still feeling a bit lonely. A bunch of my friends from my home country suggested that I should try dating around and try all sorts of dating apps. It wasn't for me. Although I have completely moved on from my previous relationship, it wasn't in my personality to date around. I did however wanted to make a friend. Since I was trying to learn the language I decided to use those language exchange apps to make a friend. It still wasn't easy haha. Eventually I got to talking with this one person and we decided to meet up for coffee. 

Now I'm going to be completely honest. I did not know what this person looked like until before agreeing to meet with her. But yeah, she was beautiful. Before moving to Japan I've been here as a tourist more than 4 times, and I've been to about 10 cities or like 3-5 prefectures ((this is not completely accurate but I've been to a lot of places)). She was the most beautiful person I've ever seen. I'm just aware of this, in my head I really wanted a friend. Let's call her Autumn. When we went out for coffee, it was one of those situations where I expected it would be quite awkward or difficult for us to communicate but we spoke enough of each other's language to not have problems talking. In fact, it felt like I met someone who I didn't really need to translate what my soul was trying to say. It felt natural. We walked around the city after, took photos, had fun banter. I eventually had to take her to a restaurant where she was meeting with her friend. She asked to exchange contact infos before saying good bye. I was pretty happy because I finally met a friend in the city. 

Our first conversations became more frequent and we actually met up immediately after just a few days. Whenever I mention something I would want to try, she would set up plans for me to try these things. From restaurants, places, views, she would make sure I get to try all of them. She wanted me to make plenty of memories in the city and I felt really lucky to meet a friend like her. My boring weekdays in my job became a lot more colorful when she came into my life. I would write down all of my experiences with her but there were too many. I eventually wanted to show my gratitude and got her a gift for Christmas which she said really made her happy. During Christmas I had to come home to my country so I left her a surprise before I left. When I came back I was a lot more aware of how I feel about her. I eventually even cooked for her. 

I'm kind of jumping timelines a bit because it's honestly too long but the sad part is eventually about to come. My job eventually told me they have to relocate me out of the prefecture by the end of the March. I felt my world shatter. I eventually had to tell her about this and asked her what she would want me to do. She said I should quit from my current company and look for another job in the city. She wanted me to stay. I asked her for how long and she said forever.

Once Valentines happened I got her flowers and she got me chocolates and we went out and had nice time together. After this day I realized that I've completely and head over heels fallen for this person. And now this coming week I have 2 job interviews left and it'll determine whether I will be able to stay in this city or not. I can't be unemployed because I'm a foreigner in this country. I'm scared of missing out on what could possibly be the best thing that can ever happen to my life. And it's been so heavy. Thank you for listening friend.",1,1739716367.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1iqtdbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1iqtdbp/trip_report_boardwalk_villas_and_our_time_outside/,Trip Report: Boardwalk Villas and our time outside of the parks,"We drove to the Boardwalk and arrived shortly after 12PM on Sunday.  I've never stayed in the Epcot or even skyliner resort area so we were very excited. Our group was mom, grandma, and my 8 yr old son.

I completed online check in a week prior but we did stop by the front desk when we got in because a. We were so early and b. We were leaving my mom behind while we went to Blizzard beach. 
 https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/s/QzEfLyqLXD

The CM at the concerierge desk informed us that a room was ready but nothing near the elevator as we requested.  My mom said that she would happily wait at the resort and gave the front desk her # so she was also notified when the room was ready not just me.  The CM told us it was a good idea to check in in person because our Magic bands would process that we weren't at the resort and that wouldn't put a priority on getting the room ready.

While we were off at Blizzard Beach my mom went to the Boardwalk Deli and sat outside and watched people on the Boardwalk and the friendship boats go by.  She said her Rueben was very large, pretty good, and ""not a bad price"".  

She sent me a text a little after 2 that our room was ready. She said that ""our balcony was pretty big"" and that were facing village green. When we got back we were so excited with our room view! We had booked pool/Garden and the expectation was either the feature pool or quiet pool but we were actually facing the middle part of the resort and had a great view of flying fish and blue ribbon corn dogs. Plus if we looked left we had a great partial view of the Yacht Club and crescent lake. 

We got dressed up and went to Flying Fish for Dinner.  I got the scallops and my mom got the snapper and we shared. I also got the lobster bisque. My son got the fish and Mac and cheese. All 3 of us feel that this was the best meal quality wise that we have ever had at Disney and also the best service we have received. Also the blood orange margarita was the best cocktail I had this trip.  Definitely 100% reccomend this if you are not using the dining plan. Space 220 and some character meals are more expensive. 

Monday we used bus transportation to Animal Kingdom which was efficient and drop you off right at the gate. We also took the boat transportation  to Epcot which was also fast and wonderful.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/s/meJcVBmHj8

Tuesday was our rest day.  I bought Joeffery's coffee at carousel coffee and took it up to the room and we sat on our balcony for awhile and watched Disney wake up and get going.  It was really cool to watch the boats launch for the day all at the same time.

We stopped back at Boardwalk Deli and got a breakfast sandwich and some pastries and decided to check out the skyliner resorts. We took our pins with us.  By this time the rope drop rush was over so we had 0 wait for the boat to Epcot or any of the skyliner stops.  We brought our pins with us and rode all the way to Art of Animation to check that out and walked to the lobby.  We checked out the gift shop and my son played on the little play area in the finding Nemo area. He was very excited to get the gondola with horace horsecollar- one of his favorite characters.  We rode back to riveria and from there took the Bus to Disney Springs.

Disney Springs was busier than I expected for a Tuesday afternoon in February but we checked out some of the shops and had lunch at the Boathouse. I love the theming here. I had the lobster roll and my mom had the filet mignon sliders. Our food was amazing and I got the mule- which was good but a pretty typical mule.  We will definitely be back here again to eat.

We then took a boat ride to Saratoga Springs as the boat service to OKW was unavailable. We checked out the lobby, grounds, and shop then decided to Uber back to the Boardwalk. It was getting hot and we wanted to swim.

The feature pool at the Boardwalk is well themed but I felt it had an odd layout.  There are 3 separate 3 ft 4 inch shallow areas as well as the bottom of the slide being about that depth too.  In order to access each of these from the water you have to cross water that is as deep as 4 ft 11 inches.  I definitely prefer a shallow to deep layout vs the different  shallow ""bays"" in this pool.  The slide is super cute but bumpy and the current at the bottom is strong.  My son had a blast though and found friends to play with each time we went.  The hot tub was small but sufficient.  The jets aren't very strong.

The pool bar has typical pool side munchies available and the bartender was very friendly and attentive. The Mickey pretzel took awhile but my son was happy with it!

I got the Mexican street corn dog at blue ribbon corn dogs and brought it back to the room. It was so good!

We then decided to ride the friendship boats and got off at Yacht and beach club and checked those out.  

When we got back to the boardwalk we played the carnival games, watched the street performers, got a slice of pizza and a piece of cake from cake bake shop (these were all shared between 3 of us).  The pizza was fine- it's pizza window pizza. Perfect for kiddos. The raspberry champagne cake was very good and a fun treat but $23 is very expensive for even a large slice of cake.  

We visited the Abracadabar which is a very neat atmosphere with all the old magic Memorbilia and comfortable seating. It was surprisingly small compared to other dedicated lounges I have been to. I got the conjurita which is a fun ""magic"" drink.

On Wednesday we waited for a long time to get in a crowded bus to MK and our bus stop felt far away. After extended evening hours we took the monorail to the Poly and then an Uber. I'm sure it took longer but it was more comfortable.

Thursday after DHS we decided to get a last-minute dinner reservation for Ale and Compass.  This is a much fancier restaurant than I expected it to be. My mom absolutely loved her seafood pot pie.  This is actually a great choice if you are looking for a fancy place at Disney thar doesn't break the bank. 

Overall we absolutely loved the boardwalk! It is my son's favorite resort overall and 2nd to only wilderness lodge for my mom and I. I know there are complaints about the food variety and not having a ""true"" quick service but between the coffee shop, margarita stand, pizza window, Deli, cake bake shop bakery, and ice cream stand I think it more than makes up for not having formal quick service.  I also feel that even though it's only the coffee shop in the lobby- if you stay at many of the Disney resorts you are staying in an outbuilding anyway so it was actually much more efficient for me to go down to the Boardwalk to get my food then all the way to the lobby area in another building. Our room wasn't as big as at the Grand Floridian or the Poly but it was still good enough space for us.  I actually found the Murphy bed to be quite comfortable. The only downside to me was the pool layout- but definitely not a deal breaker. 

We are now back home in the cold north and already wishing we were still at Disney!",9,1739716223.0,WaltDisneyWorld,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iqt6qv,https://i.redd.it/x2qhw4dvfije1.png,G&M 1948 Glen Grant 72 Year Old,"REVIEW: Gordon & Mcphail 1948 Glen Grant 72 years old

I've been meaning to add this review for a couple of years as there should be a record outside of the rarified air at the very top of the whisky market for what is without a shadow of a doubt the greatest whisky ever made. 

The GG72 is one of a set of whiskies referred to as the 'ultra rares' laid down in the 1940s by the legendary 'Mr' George Urquhart of G&M. 

What makes them set apart from normal whisky is that they're matured in 'transport' casks. 

In the days before Spain made it a requirement for sherry to be matured and bottled in Jerez sherry was shipped around the world in casks to be bottled in situ. 

What made those casks special was the extreme thickness of the gauge and the tightness of the seals that made maturation slower and longer but, in the end for greater effect. The ultra rares combine greater flavour with ridiculous ABVs for their age. 

The GG72 bottles are dartington crystal and designed, along with the presentation case, by the Karuizawa design team. They also come with a truly insane 20kg 4'x2' security carry case (which I know from personal experience scuffs horribly at the slightest touch haha üòÑ).

Before I give the final tasting notes let me first say that the GG72 represents the very pinnacle of whisky production. The worlds greatest whisky experts have stated both publicly and privately that it is the finest they've ever tried. 

When I was privileged enough to taste it it put me in mind of the historian Plutarch who said of Alexander the Great that one day Alexander surveyed the whole of his domain and he sat and began to weep for there was no more world left to conquer.

And thus I felt. I knew that from that day every whisky I would ever try would be compared to that moment in my mind and fall short. I had peaked. There was nowhere else to go. it is, my friends, a terrible and beautiful thing to know you cannot ever do better than you already have. 

But to the review. 

LOOK:
Very dark. Deeper even than aged Glendronach. The closest to actual oloroso colouring as any whisky I've ever seen.
Viscosity extreme. It seems to grip the glass as it swirls. 
Beading clear, defined and precise. 

NOSE:
Smooth and full of life. The promise of what is to come rings with each breath. Astounding to feel such life in a whisky of such age. 
Oak and sherry dominates. Coconut mixed with Christmas spice and the sense of summer fruit rising amist the cacophony of dry spice only to fade each time you focus on it to be left with smoke. Soft, soft smoke the type I have never tasted in a speyside but that my grandfather used to tell stories of lingers. 


PALATE:
Mouthfeel is rich and full. The sensation of fruit jam mixed with red wine and coats the mouth immediately. Again astonishing to encounter such life and vibrancy at such an age.
Sweet fruit arrives first to be immediately replaced by billowing dry Christmas spices and sherry fruit. Each mouthful creates a new combination of flavour that begs to be appreciated before it vanishes and a new one rises out of the mix to tickle the senses when, it too, slides behind the next.

FINISH:
Lingering but not too long. If I was forced to find any way that this godlike dram could be bettered it is that its finish lasts 'only' a full minute in the mouth. 
Flavours of complex smoke fight on the tongue for recognition. Dry phenols alongside coffee and bitter chocolate. Again my grandfather (born 1904) used to speak of a time where speyside whisky flavour contained such smoke but I have never tasted such things. 

CONCLUSION:
Even beyond the flavours and the privilege of tasting a whisky of such value or age is the window that this offers into a world long gone. This whisky is one of the very last opportunities to taste the speysides of myth. The same speysides flavours that the legendary 1920s and 30s macallan bottles will contain. 

Hope you all enjoy my review. I may add others of the ultra rares in time for the record if people are interested. 
But some people may get upset I take a dim view of the macallans lol. ",51,1739715667.0,Scotch,17,0.95,False

She quit her job during covid, and became a stay at home mom, but she was basically taking care of my grandparents. She didn‚Äôt have any hobbies back then and was mostly taking care of my grandparents, but around two years ago she started gardening. 

Everything was fine at first, I was really supportive, but at times she was just neglecting herself. She worked in the full sun, never bathed after work, and wasn‚Äôt getting out of the house. I understood it back then, because she wasn‚Äôt leaving because of my grandparents.

Last year my grandma died in January. It was rough and exhausting experience for us, and after she passed away, my mom was only taking care of grandpa. She still wasn‚Äôt leaving the house, barely ate, bathed, or did anything for herself other than doing her hobbies. When my grandpa passed away in November, she took ot hard, but as sad as it sounds, I knew she finally would be able to get the life she always wanted. She was living with them non stop for 50 years, and she couldn‚Äôt do much, because my grandparents were very demanding. 

It has been few weeks after we were all alone, and I think that my mom is getting worse than she used to be. I offered her to book her an appointment with my hairstylist since she wanted to go, but each time she declined it, saying that she will be busy (it‚Äôs not because or the hobbies. Sometimes she would stay all day in her bed). When I was coming home from uni, I was bringing her things that I bought for her, like shampoos or conditioners simply because she wanted to try them. She used ot once or twice and placed it on the shelf in the bathroom (very expensive brands). Lately she started renovating the house. She was pushing herself to the limit, only smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee. I noticed that her state is absolutely awful. Her hair was falling out, it wasn‚Äôt washed or brushed in long time, and the only time she actually took care of herself was when my stepfather arrived home.

I am concerned about her. How do I help her and convince her to take care of herself properly? I picked up on gym to get better, and she said that she wants to join, but she always had an excuse to avoid actually training with me. I tried helping her by buying her stuff to encourage her to use it, but it didn‚Äôt work. At this rate I feel like she‚Äôs going to drive herself to the grave with that constant and intense work.

I started AIP diet about a mouth ago due to multiple Autoimmune diseases ( Arthritis, Crohn, and recently Vasculitis..). The things is I never stopped eating eggs, which I now think can be problematic since I've stopped eating them for 5 days and when eating them again, I have had a little mini flare comeback. This is devastating for me cause I love eggs.

I also started eating potatoes when started this diet( I know it's dumb but I just don't know what to eat). 

What I am asking you for is some idea for foods I can eat everyday.
Also I am doing an intermittent fasting 16/8 but if can't follow due to night shifts I kinda cut it sometimes. It is not too difficult to follow since my sugar cravings had stopped.

Right now my main foods are :

Mornings :
-Egg and eggs white and pickle eggs(was eating a lot of eggs everyday but now have to see if I can eat them again)
-Canned tuna(1-2 cans per week because of mercury)
-Canned sardines
-Spinache(with eggs it was delicious)

Meals :
-Mostly chicken breast everyday (90% of the time)
-Salmon
-Boiled carrots 
-Boiled potatoes once every 2-3 days(I know I shouldn't but don't what to eat)
-Zucchini once every 2 days
-Sometimes boiled broccoli and cauliflower (just cause I loved them and it doesn't seem to make any pain)

Cheat meals : 
-BBQ chicken rotisserie once a week( not eating skin)
-A plate of Chicken wings in the oven only once a mouth (and I didn't had any symptoms after the first time)

Cheat Dessert :
-Blueberries (for digestive issues. Cause I go to bathroom once every 5-6 days since I started this diet)
-Bananas when feeling really hungry and have to eat something on the spot.

Drinks:
Only Water (no more coffee, soda, alcohol, energy drinks.. nothing)

So that's about all eat for a little than a month now. It's not to hard I got used to it for now. But needs some help with any suggestions.

Thanks.
