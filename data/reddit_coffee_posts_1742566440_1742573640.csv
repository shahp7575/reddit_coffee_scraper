I have several issues:

* Acne‚Äîhad it all my life
* Extremely tired when I wake up
* Lethargic after lunch
* Epilepsy‚Äîseizures under control with medication for over a year

The only change I've noticed is that I wake up less groggy. Could anyone enlighten me on what to expect, particularly regarding acne and energy levels?

I have zero cravings.

More details:  
I completely cut out sugar this month. Then I removed gluten, followed by rice, then nuts. Now my diet consists of eggs, sprouts, seeds, coffee, cooked vegetables, half a fruit, and cheela (a lentil/chickpea flour pancake made from dal/besan).

Thanks to Reddit and all of you‚ÄîI couldn't have done this without this community!",1,1742573612.0,sugarfree,0,1.0,False

Aged around 60ish and visibly angry.

The conversation was as bizarre as it was angry.

In between the background noise and the incomprehensible bits I heard:

""He was standing in OUR streets""

""I walked right up to him and asked, was he Chinese or Japanese"" Because as we all know they are the only two places in Asia.

""I demanded to know what God he worshipped!"" ""My God is a true God!""

""I asked him, was he in the army????? Because I know they like killing people!""

All this while Asian people were present trying to eat and drink their coffees.

I will be making a little complaint later for them to look out for this in future. The whole situation was demented.",3,1742573486.0,Belfast,0,1.0,False
1jgkieu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1jgkieu/12_week_constipation_and_uncomfortable_bloating/,12 week constipation and uncomfortable bloating!,"Hi pregnancy peeps! I am a little over 12 weeks pregnant with my first. I need some thoughts from folks who have experienced what I‚Äôm about to describe and then found a way to feel better(not necessarily eliminate the symptoms, because‚Ä¶it‚Äôs pregnancy, afterall! But that would be great, too üòâ)

I‚Äôll start by saying I am super hydrated, active, and eat a high fiber/balanced diet. I also have about 2 cups of coffee each morning. I‚Äôm convinced my symptoms are just an unfortunate and intense reaction to progesterone:-/ Though I think they‚Äôd be even worse if I didn‚Äôt pay attention to the above! Okay, my questions‚Ä¶

Constipation started this past week and is much worse throughout the day and at night, which has kept me from sleeping. I did manage to poop a bit with my morning coffee the first few days, but not nearly enough. My doc suggested magnesium citrate(400g) and miralax. I have used them for the past two days and after about 12 hours, did get some watery stools and a bit of relief. But again, doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs getting everything and I also suspect  they are making me even MORE bloated, unfortunately.

Here‚Äôs a specific question: If I had some diarrhea(tmi, sorry!!) this morning(I managed to poop 3x in a short period), but still feel like more needs to be cleaned out‚Ä¶do you think an enema would do the trick? I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm still impacted or it‚Äôs just the extreme bloating/distention. I‚Äôm just guessing I would have even more obvious relief if the miralax and magnesium had truly cleared everything out?? Anyone deal with this? If I am cleared out and just can‚Äôt tell‚Ä¶is it dangerous to try and enema?

Last specific question: The bloating and constipation get worse throughout the day and literally making it impossible to sleep at night. We are talking 2 hours at most the last two nightsüò´ Has anyone found a way to improve this, even just a little? I go for walks, massage my tummy, do breathing and movements, but they seem more like a distraction, than a true help. Also, I eat small meals at a time, but it seems anything I eat - even water(still drinking a ton though) - aggravates the bloat!!

Any helpful advice out there!! I‚Äôm sincerely struggling.üò¨üíù",1,1742573476.0,BabyBumps,1,1.0,False

1jgkh0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jgkh0m/update_to_whole_latte_love_zach/,Update to Whole Latte Love & Zach,"First I'll start by saying that WLL has not coerced me into making this post, and I am doing so on my own free will. I want to recognize that WLL has stepped up and made me whole, and I appreciate the support.

Zach called me personally late last night to apologize for the situation with the machine and he offered to ship me a brand new machine in replacement, free of charge.  He also offered additional context to the support program, which I did not previously have.  WLL's perspective is that Dalla Corte was bought by Franke, and shortly thereafter, Franke stopped allowing WLL to obtain parts to provide service.  Franke has taken over the repair for the Dalla Corte machines with their Franke service program, despite the fact that Franke has not setup a network to repair the machines yet.  I did not know this previously, I only had comms from WLL's phone support that did not provide detail or context.  Additionally, Zach mentioned that WLL is migrating their CRM and have lost some of my trails of comms in the past few weeks.

Since this is now being resolved, I'll fill in some additional details I omitted yesterday.

The machine is a Dalla Corte Mina, delivered in June, 2024.  The issue is a faulty DFR, which regulates the flow of water throughout the flow profile.  The machine overall is 100% commercial grade and incredible when working at full-speed.

The specific issue is that the flow rate is super slow, alarms the machine, and bonks out.  So if it is supposed to be flowing at 10 grams/sec, it actually flows at approx 2g/s.  Basically resulting in filterless drip coffee at best, with shots taking over 2 minutes to pull. Pressure is not built and the coffee is terrible.

The issue became steadily worse to the point where I couldn't pull a single shot decently without an alarm.  I went directly to Dalla Corte and they provided me single step actions in each email, resulting in several months of back and forth emails with the group in Italy.  The final step was removal and cleaning of the DFR, which I did, and slightly improved function, however, did not resolve the issue.  I suspect that there is some corrosion forming inside the DFR due to a quality issue with the part, which is causing the DFR to stick and not open correctly to allow water through.  When I cleaned it, I removed some of the surface corrosion, but did not resolve the corrosion and will continue to worsen as the part continues to corrode.

At this point, Dalla Corte started bad mouthing WLL and making claims that WLL had abandonded their customers and said Dalla Corte would be willing to send me a replacement DFR, but would not be willing to provide me with the programming machine required to calibrate the new DFR.  So basically, they left me stranded.

When Zach called last night, he explained that Dalla Corte will not allow WLL to get the DFR part either, and that is why the only recourse they have is to give me a brand new machine at this point.

So at the end of the day, WLL has come through and will be making me whole again.  I have not been coerced into making this post by WLL, it is on my own free will.

Thank you to WLL for stepping up to replace the machine.

I was a relatively strict instructor for my graduate assistantship and as an adjunct afterwards. I did not assign much homework but I was pretty strict on exams. No food, no talking, no cell phones, and most importantly.. after I have handed out the exams, no questions until you are finished the exam with the exception of whatever you are asking a question about. Meaning, finish everything you can before you ask a question. The idea would be they ask whatever question they have to try to get the answer out of me, I tell them what I can.. they answer the question and then turn it in. Students seem to want to chat and game you \*during\* exams and I would tell them to quit or I would fail them on the exam for talking during the exam. 

\- Enough students ignored me and asked about spelling after I hand out the exam and start proctoring. One student asked during every exam.

\- Students with such weak English skills they did not understand the directions at all. Huge pressure not to fail them. I can not even expect them to wait until they finish the rest of the exam to ask me questions.

\- Students who were too grown up to follow the rules. A senior should understand not to bring coffee and snacks on an exam day when we have 100+ people in the lecture hall.

\- Students cheating together, using devices, and then trying to appeal their failure. Then being given support by higher ups. Why not just give them all As when they cut the check?

\- A chair that expected me to teach a course online, AND ALSO offer in-class instruction for the same section which is supposed to be 100% online.

\- Losing summer teaching opportunities because of chair's favoritism and pettiness.

The kids are getting dumber because we let them. I was punished for any attempt to get students to try, do their own work, or fail. Sink or swim, and we are forced to give them floaties.",3,1742572859.0,Professors,0,0.8,False
1jgk90f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1jgk90f/neighborhood_recs_for_easy_commute/,Neighborhood recs for easy commute?,Hi I'll be moving to Columbus to take a job near the airport. I have family in Hampstead Village I'll probably be visiting weekly for dinner. I'm single so I'd rather live in a younger area instead of being out in the suburbs. In my downtime I usually hit up coffee shops and bookstores and it'd be great if there was something walking distance so I didn't have to drive everywhere. Ideally I'm looking for something accessible to running trails and parks but these I don't mind driving to on weekends. The biggest factor for me is my commute time to work since I have to go in 5 days a week. I'd like my commute to be under 30min in rush hour traffic. Any recs? ,1,1742572840.0,Columbus,3,1.0,False
1jgk8t3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1jgk8t3/help_fixing_a_situation/,Help fixing a situation,"Backstory: We met November 2024, he has an admin job at my school and not responsible for grading. I'm late 20s and he's mid thirties; so an age gap but we have similar maturity. Sometimes he joins projects when students are missing  and we've worked together. I see him a few days every month so it's not frequent enough to be serious. 

The problem: Everytime we meet the tension is really bad. He looks at me intensely and curiously and I blush. We always greet each other smiling and he sometimes winks but small talk feels self conscious and awkward. Sometimes he is also a bit clumsy. We have similar beliefs and styles and we're both friendly people normally! I think he's so hot and interesting but now we kind of ignore each other and I avoid him since it feels strange and now he probably thinks l'm rude. He added me on Facebook and I followed him on Instagram and he followed me back and liked some older pictures. He also likes stories I make with me in them and wished me happy birthday.

Does he think l'm not interested because I avoid him so this is why he doesn't message? Or would it be because it's at school? I was hoping he would make the first move but should I just ask if he wants to go for coffee or something?",1,1742572825.0,bodylanguage,0,0.99,False

1jgk8a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1jgk8a9/i_think_the_postpartum_fog_has_started_to_lift/,I think the postpartum fog has started to lift for me.,"My son was born a little over 4 months ago. While I have always been enamored with him, I have struggled with my transition to motherhood. I have always been very independent, love my alone time and down time with my husband, loved to travel, bop around on a whim, spend an afternoon in a coffee shop, and I have a very demanding career. I've always suspected I wanted kids and cemented that once I met my husband, who is amazing.

As everyone says, you can't know what having a child is like until it happens, and that's so true. I had naively thought that I might have an easier time of facing the challenges of parenthood because of my job - I work long hours, I often have to make quick decisions that have large, financial consequences, and I've just generally considered myself to be someone who both works well under pressure and has the fortitude to keep going even when things are hard. I guess there is no way to know if this helped me  - maybe it would have been a much more challenging transition without this experience - but holy shit, motherhood has humbled me. 

I have struggled immensely with dedicating my whole self to someone else. Even my breaks are consumed with thoughts of whether he's safe, fed, napping, or happy. It's also challenged my need for control. My husband often has to remind me that if babies went down for naps or bed exactly when they were supposed to, and never crabbed in public, everyone would have them, no problem. I have a hard time accepting that if things don't go perfectly, it's not something I'm doing wrong, he's just a baby.

I spent hours trapped in a dark nursery contact napping, hoping for the day when he'd fall asleep independently in his crib. Hours being distracted when trying to hang out with friends, waiting for the moment he'd start to crab. Always anticipating something ""inconvenient"" happening and letting it ruin the current convenient moment.

I was on the edge of rage most of the time, one mistake away from crying or needing to scream into a pillow. Then spiraling with guilt that my son saw me sob, thinking I had messed up his ability to regulate his emotions for life. I often compared my journey to those on social media or the highlights I'd see of my friends' lives on Instagram, constantly worried about why my baby couldn't do certain things or about how I wasn't enjoying every second of motherhood. I spent a lot of my maternity leave sad, even though I enjoyed a lot of the time I spent with my son.

But I just wanted to share that recently, I've begun to feel the weight of a lot of those things lift. I'm not sure exactly why - maybe it's a hormonal shift, maybe I'm starting to get my motherhood legs under me, maybe I'm facing the fact my maternity leave is over in 4 short weeks, maybe my baby is becoming more of a real person - I'm not sure. But I've tossed away any sort of comparison to other babies and following most advice I see online. I'm following my baby's cues and seeing each hiccup as a challenge to overcome and as something to help me grow with my baby. Standing in the kitchen today, I realized that I've really enjoyed the last week. I look forward to each new day with my son, excited for him to wake up from naps, even enjoying contact naps (!!!), and loving solving problems with him. My husband even said that it seems his crying is starting to impact me less - what used to send me into an anxious spiral is now something I just chat through with him, even if he keeps crying. 

I don't think that I will ever see the old me again or have my old life back. But I think my new life is really exciting, and these moments with my son are fleeting. I feel some guilt for not enjoying the first few months as much as I should have, and I'm sorry to him for not giving him my best. But he has taught me to be a mother, and I am better because of him. I think these first few months have set up the foundation for a great couple of years with him, and I'm so happy to be on the other side (for now).",5,1742572791.0,NewParents,1,1.0,False
1jgk889,https://i.redd.it/t50fii3kf2qe1.jpeg,Busted can of biscuits!,"This is my second loaf. My first one didn‚Äôt have a busted can of biscuits on the side. ü§£ The only thing I did different this time was add 50g of wheat flour, instead of 500g white. Oh, and also added a little steam, but still probably not enough. I didn‚Äôt let it rest in the fridge either time before baking, but will next time! 

Have you had this happen and what did you do to remedy it? 

Recipe: 
1. Feed starter 1:1:1. That means 1-part starter, 1-part warm water, 1-part four. I use King Arthur
Bread flour
2. Mix together well, scarping sides of jar. Mark the height of the starter with a hair tie or elastic.
Let it on counter with a coffee filter covering it.
3. Once starter has doubled in size it is ready to bake with. If it doesn't double is size not to worry, just feed it again
4. You can accumulate a lot of starter. I usually keep 75g to keep my starter going is discard the rest.
5. You can keep the discard (in the fridge with a cover) and make other recipes like, pizza crust, crackers, and some cookies and baked goods. King Arthur has a ton of recipes.
Baking artisan loaf of bread
1. Measure 100g of starter and add 325-350g of warm water. Mix until frothy bubbles occur.
2. Add 450g of bread four and 50g of wheat flour. Or do all 500g of bread flour.
Add 10g of fine sea salt.
4. Mix until you have a shaggy dough
5. Allow to sit covered with damp cloth for 30 minutes then do your first of four stretch and fold's.
These will occur every 30 minutes
6. After the stretch and folds are complete. Allow dough to rise on counter covered until it has almost doubled in size. Anywhere from 6-12 hours depending on the temperature of house. It should have some bubbles and be jiggly.
7. Once dough has raised allow it to naturally fall out of the bowl onto the counter.
8. Stretch the dough out into a rectangle, fold in thirds, and roll into a ball, and then shape. I suggest finding a video of this process.
9. Once shaped place in proofing bowl lines with cloth towel and lightly floured, place loaf in bowl cover, let rest in the fridge for 1-24 hours.
10. Place dough on parchment paper and cut a semi-circle with a razor blade or very sharp knife.
11. Bake oven 450 degrees in Dutch oven covered for 20 minutes then uncovered for 20 minutes, until golden brown. Let the Dutch oven preheat with the oven, place a few ice cubes in the bottom prior to putting the dough into the Dutch oven
12. Once done baking, remove from pan and allow to fully cool prior to cutting.

Last week we met up and had coffee, we only stayed for an hour and a half because of weather but it was a great date, my only regret is that I didn‚Äôt really try to initiate any physical contact. Tomorrow we‚Äôll be going out to supper, and I want this date to be a good one as well, so I have a few questions. 

1. How physical should I try and be? I know this really depends, but I want to at least go in with a personal goal of maybe hugging, holding hands, or kissing (this is assuming the date goes good and she seems comfortable enough for me to try) I‚Äôve sort of always struggled with showing affection in the talking stage, I don‚Äôt want that to ruin my chances with this girl or to just be seen as a friend. 

2. We only have dinner planned, but should I try and extend the date? There‚Äôs an arcade/bowling alley in the area and I think it might be fun if we went after dinner. If yes, should I mention it before or during the date?

3. Should I offer to pick her up? I think it would be a good idea, it may also give me a chance to hold hands, at the same time this is only the second date and I don‚Äôt want to make her uncomfortable. 

4. Is there any specific topics I should try and bring up? Should I be a bit deeper than our first date, or should I stick to the introductory getting to know you type of conversations?

When she came over she asked can we have coffee tomorrow instead since she's still got quite a lot of work. I agreed and said no worries at all and said anytime after 6:30pm tomorrrow would be great. I told her to come over and just knock on my door whenever shes free then and we can go get coffee. She said Great! We made some small talk for a few minutes and then said goodbye. 

The next day comes and she didn't come over or say anything. My guess is she mightve just fallen asleep and or forgotten about it since she's been so busy and drained. 

Currently I've gone home for the weekend to my parents and would like to still get coffee with her when I come back at the end of the weekend. 

How do I go about this? Should I knock on her door again and just ask her again? Would that be too pushy? Or would it be better just to leave it and wait for her to come one day and be like hey remember that coffee?

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of ‚Ç¨1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

I‚Äôm French, and I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of **French learners** at some point say something like:

>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get when to use pass√© compos√© or imparfait. It feels random.‚Äù

I really get why it feels that way. The rules you find in textbooks are often too vague (*‚Äúone is for completed actions, one is for descriptions‚Äù* okay, cool, but that doesn‚Äôt help when you‚Äôre telling a story).

So here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd **explain it if you were my friend**, over a coffee, not in a classroom:

**üëâ Pass√© compos√© = something happens**  
Boom. It happened. It started, it ended. You‚Äôre moving the story forward.  
*J‚Äôai mang√© une pizza.* ‚Üí The action exists, it happened, we‚Äôre done.

**üëâ Imparfait = background**  
It sets the scene, gives context, tells us how things *were* at that moment.  
*Il pleuvait.* = It was raining. It doesn‚Äôt move the story forward. It‚Äôs just there.

Now combine them, and you get something like:

>Il pleuvait quand je suis sorti.  
(It was raining when I went out.)

‚Üí The rain is the background (imparfait), me going out is the action that happens (pass√© compos√©).  
You can almost feel the **camera angle change**.

üé• **Another tip I give is to imagine a film scene.**  
Imparfait = what we see in the background  
Pass√© compos√© = what the camera zooms in on

>J‚Äô√©tais fatigu√©, alors j‚Äôai pris un caf√©.  
I was tired (background), so I had a coffee (action).

Of course there are tricky cases (vouloir, savoir, √™tre...) but if you think in terms of ‚Äúcamera movement‚Äù I think it could help a lot. Don't hesitate if you have any questions, maybe I or someone else could answer you!

By the way, I built a tool to help you **learn French** by listening to our **French podcast** with a **live transcription** that highlights each word as it's spoken, maybe you‚Äôll find it useful! [https://lapausecafecroissant.fr/podcasts/20/nos-metiers-de-reve-ou-learn-french-with-conversations](https://lapausecafecroissant.fr/podcasts/20/nos-metiers-de-reve-ou-learn-french-with-conversations)

1jgk3ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCTherapistMeetup/comments/1jgk3ck/welcome/,Welcome,"Welcome all fellow NYC therapists! 

We all know how isolating this job can be at times, I know for myself personally some of my best memories prior to becoming a therapist was when I could work trauma bond and joke around with coworkers. 

Now many of us only have time to see clients with not a lot of work social opportunities. 

If this sounds like you or are just interested in expanding your sense of community with some like minded people then this is for you! 

Please feel free to fill out this interest form and we will be in touch shortly to secure a place for our first meetup! 

Looking forward to meeting you all soon! 

(P.s I know we‚Äôre all therapists but that doesn‚Äôt mean every meetup has to be work related, I‚Äôm thinking axe throwing, hiking, coffee shop, escape room, dinners, anything and everything)

1jgk25u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jgk25u/any_advice_on_dealing_with_a_disabled_mother_who/,Any advice on dealing with a disabled mother who has given up on life?,"Hello Reddit,

I feel pretty defeated asking here for help but I have no one in my personal life who I can turn to for help, as no one I know has been in this situation, and after years of trying to handle the stress I think I am worn down. 

My mother has a slurry of disability (diabetes, arthritis, fibromyalgia, hypertension, depression) and I'm afraid that in the past few years, specifically after her fibromyalgia diagnosis in 2021 she has slowly stopped trying to live a life.


Over the past year she has stopped trying to do her recommended exercises that her doctors have given her, she'll sometimes not attend her doctor appointments, and she has started creating a mini home inside her bedroom. In the past few months she has bought a coffee maker and a mini fridge for her bedroom so she ""doesn't need to leave her room if she doesn't have the energy."" I can have empathy that some days must feel like the word itself is against her, and punishing her for merely existing, but I worry over her seemingly enabling her bad days by not even trying to leave her room and instead staying in bed all day eating junk food. She used to try to go out shopping with us, she drives and was super excited to get her car back last year, but since she's gotten it she's turned to online shopping, the only way she'll leave the house is when she takes me to college once a week (she's the one who insists on this, which I'm proud of her for) 

It has been really difficult to watch my mother to from this independent person to this person who snaps at me repeatedly, who refuse to go outside, who has gained a shopping addiction that is running her relationship with her husband and her daughter, and who isn't actively listening to any advice she's been given by doctors.

I have been trying to encourage her to go out, but she keeps refusing, saying she can't be bothered. I worry that she is only out once a week, I also worry that she keeps refusing people over. She has family who loves her, who cares about her, who want to go out their way to come and visit her, and my mother will agree to these visits and then on the day tell family she doesn't want them over anymore, then complain no one wants to see her, and I know these family members are getting frustrated with this habit of hers (some have explicitly told me that they no longer want to visit due to this) 

She keeps doing things that are making her worse, and I just need any advice at all on how I can keep handling this, I am so stressed and worried on a constant basis, and it hurts to know that mother I grew up with is gone, escpicially when we're both so young, it's not fair on her, and I hate myself for feeling upset and frustrated with my mother, I just need any advice at all on how to deal with this emotionally, how to not let seeing my mother this way effect me so much, and if anyone has any advice at all on maybe how to support her better I am completely all ears

* ""„Ç≥„Éº„Éí„Éº„ÅÑ„Çã?"" I heard someone ask someone else if she wants coffee. Textbook teaches us a different way, I was so confused when I heard this.

1jgjza7,https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1jgjza7/bass_doubling/,Bass Doubling?,"I little background on me before I pose my question:

I worked for 12 years as a professional car stereo installer. The last 3 years were at a high end shop in Beverly Hills. I am a General Class ham. I am experienced in radio and audio bench repair. At 66, I have designed and tweaked hundreds of sound systems in homes and cars of all types. I have a wood shop and have built a ton of speaker enclosures, both tuned to spec or built to fit. All that being said, I have no formal degree or professional training.

From Google's AI: Low bass frequencies, with their long wavelengths, can seem inaudible or weak at close distances because¬†they haven't had enough space to fully develop and their sound waves may be canceling each other out.¬†We've all seen this, especially with larger woofers. As you increase your distance from the subwoofer, the volume seems to increase. In fact, if you are too close to a direct firing subwoofer, you might not actually hear the bass, but be able to feel it.

How do headphones produce any bass at all? The tiny little driver is less than an inch from your ear. Given that it takes over 11 ft for a 100hz syne wave to complete and become audible, what are we actually hearing. I first became familiar with this phenomena when I was building small wedge boxes for behind the seat in pickup trucks. With the seat folded forward, there was zero bass. With the seat upright and almost touching the woofers, Boom!, lots of bass.

I recently converted my coffee table to a subwoofer for the home entertainment system. The box volume is barely 2 cu ft. The specs call for and enclosure twice that size for 1 driver in a sealed enclosure. I installed 4 12"" PA drivers down firing in a sealed enclosure. The face of the speakers are elevated about 3"" above the floor.  I had no idea what it would sound like and didn't expect it to work. I'm driving it with a Berringer 800 watt amp. I did a sound test after connecting it with the table sitting on it's side. I had to crank the volume high enough to bottom out the cones before there was any bass. I was sure it was a bad design. I was ready to haul it back to the shop and build another one the right way. I decided to set the coffee table upright and do the same sound test. The whole room lit up. There was unbelievable bass! It was very tight and accurate. It didn't have that typical boomie home entertainment center bass. I ended up installing a couple of 20hz high pass F Mods to block the subsonic noise. 

I'm hoping someone much smarter than me can explain what we are dealing with here. I have always referred to it as doubling. I'm sure it somehow works on the same principle as venting an enclosure. Is it related to sound pressure or reflected waves exiting at the point of completion? Is there a formula to determine the correct distance to the reflector?

Thanks for reading my post. Maybe someone can shed some light on what we are dealing with and how to accurately replicate it in future designs.

I drink all kinds of coffee from local brew, pour over, lattes, but recently into espressos. Typically I drink 2-3 cups a day some times 4.

A bit of background: I previously dabbled in pour over and I recently got a portable espresso machine called Outin but want to upgrade to a beginner setup. I am decently read up on all things espresso, but need some advice on what to get.

Would prefer a small to medium footprint machine, with a budget up to about $1000 including accessories.

I'm considering between getting a hybrid machine or a separate grinder + espresso machine. If it was the former I was thinking the breville barista pro would be my pick. If it were the former I was thinking of the breville bambino (not plus) and perhaps the DF54 or opus grinder. As of now I'm leaning more towards the barista pro since it also comes with accessories and decreases the need to source for them individually. I might also consider upgrading them once I get better especially a bottomless portafilter, wdt tool, puck screen, and tamp.

I would be eternally grateful if experienced folks could point out some pros and cons, considerations, or owners of the above could shed some light on learnings. Thank you in advance!",1,1742571798.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1jgjtu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1jgjtu0/should_i_take_a_contract_extension_for_an/,Should I take a contract extension for an industry I‚Äôm not interested in working in anymore? Anyone have advice on how to deal with vague contracts?,"I‚Äôve been contracting for the past couple of months and it‚Äôs been a weird experience. Today my employer contacted me and they said they wanted to let me know that they‚Äôre planning to extend my contract with the possibility of full time‚Äîbut they don‚Äôt have the exact dates yet. 

This is a reoccurring theme and happened the first time they extended my contract. 

For context, at the end of the first quarter I asked my boss when my exit interview was because I was only contracted for that quarter and ‚Äúthe possibility of an extension‚Äù conversation never came up. Then his supervisor overheard and informally told me they would be extending my contract and apologized for not telling me about it sooner. I told them I needed this on paper and they never sent one until my account manager hounded them for it. 

After being informed by my employer today. I responded with ‚ÄúIf appropriate, I can provide a finalized answer regarding my interest once you have the confirmed dates‚Äù (I felt like a baller when I said this lmao). Then they said threw a fish line out there, ‚Äúwell there‚Äôs a possibility this could be full time, you‚Äôre interested in becoming full time right‚Äù? 

Which is a reoccurring phrase that they say in an attempt to keep people on. My boss says that to me all the time, the HR dept says that to all the contractors. Someone that has tenure here even said to me directly that this isn‚Äôt the place to be for growth and I personally feel like you‚Äôre wasting your talents here. (Idk if they just want to get rid of me or if they‚Äôre actually looking out for me‚Äîthey‚Äôre the Machiavellian type.)

All of the people I liked working with has been laid off or left. Need the money, but really tired of my employer pretending to be a dominatrix and torturing me with BS possibilities. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll take the extension, but I need money üò≠. 

Am I making the right choice here?

Pros: Job pays well and I need to start saving money to move out of my parents place; I‚Äôm using what I studied in school, lenient on time off, higher ups don‚Äôt really care if you show up late, they feed you sometimes, free snacks and coffee. 

Cons: No room for growth, chaotic work environment, clueless leadership, no HR dept onsite, hour commute, and passive aggressive coworkers. 

End note: I thought about other jobs but no one will hire me due to being a fresh grad with little experience. This was my first big boy job. I‚Äôve considered about returning to university or night school to get a second bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering. But I really just need a job to support myself right now.

1jgjt8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1jgjt8c/legal_guy_daw_have_conscience_po/,Legal Guy daw.. Have conscience po,"Met this guy thru online app.

We had a good conversation, he was super responsive and sweet so I decided to meetup with him.

We met at Wendys near his place. Though we've exchanged pic he didn't notice me until Ive waved at him. I'm having second thoughts since I think he is too thin for me but decided to give it a try since we are already there. One thing I noticed during the meet is he is always distracted by people outside. I interpreted it as him not being interested, he suddenly told me that he has a meeting. Since I want to maximize the moment and test the waters, I told him that I want to cuddle with him and Im willing to wait. He told me that I can wait at the amenity area of the condo. Then he had the virtual meeting.

The meeting extended more than he expect. he approached and told me that we can go to his unit na. Upon reaching the unit, I was shy since Im not familiar with the area. He was sweet and made me comfortable. He told me that I can lie on the bed while he's in the meeting. I try to reach his hand. We cuddle, kiss and others. He was fit, sweet. everything that I could wish for. He wanted me to stay but I can't since I live with my parents. Though I wanted to stay, I can't and may pasok pa tom. I told him we can try on Friday or Weekend but he told me that he go to his province on those days. 

Since I've been hooked up by him I insisted on meeting the Friday that week. He replied ok but after dinner he was going to his province. I chose a japanese restaurant near his place which I thought had a good food. We ride his car and go to the place. On the restaurant I was surprised by the expensive cost of the food. Our bill reached almost 2k for 2 serving of 100g pork samgyup, 1 bibimbap, 1 order of lettuce, 1 order of egg slices. Settling the bill, both of us will be using card, I told him that it is ok for me to use my card since I am in need of credits in order to waive my annual fee. after that we rode the car and park at nearby to talk and kiss a little then he hatid me to my place.

After a week, I contacted him to meet again for dinner. I told him that Im waiting at the mall at his condo. He told me that he will be running late. so Ive waited almost 3hrs. I thought that it is only ok since I can sleepover at his place. then we had dinner which cost 700+. upon settling the bill, in my thought he should settle it since I already paid for the prev dinner. but he insisted for me to pay the bill since he only has his debit card. He told me that he will just pay me after. Then we had coffee costing 400+ which he paid. We had a good conversation but Ive noticed that he was always in his phone. the night grows deeper,  he then told me that he cant invite me to his unit since there were ongoing repairs. It made me sad since I want to cuddle with him. then we parted ways.

Once I got home, I remember the bill that was supposed to be settled. I messaged him the amount and the qr code. We said our goodnights but he ignored my message regarding the payment. Saturday went, he said he was busy since he went to the province. Sunday came, I didnt receive a reply. Thursday came, he messaged me that he was having trouble. But I think it is just his way of not paying me. I'd like to give him space for now and will messaged him again on Monday.

He is always online in the app. Possibly talking to other people. It was my first time encountering such a person. All the people Ive met have been courteous and professional. He is a ""lawyer"" pa naman and also a ""pastor"". Hopefully he still has a conscience. Dont want to take this further, just want him to pay me for what is due. 

Learnings: Settle the bill before going home. Expensive Learning.. Hopefully, I'll not be a victim again. Be wise when meeting people although you like them.",2,1742571733.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

I understand this is not the greatest machine but I know it‚Äôs popular and people have managed to brew decent shots with it.    I‚Äòve played around with it for a few days now and have tried following some YouTube tutorials but haven‚Äôt made anything worth drinking yet.   I‚Äôm not a big fan of straight espresso and intend to use it primarily for lattes and cappuccinos .  I have a cuisart burr mill which is supposed to be trash for espresso grinding.   So for now I stopped at my local coffee shop and had them grind me their medium dark roast with an espresso grinding.  Again, not ideal but it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm working with.   Using the stock portafilter and unpressurized cup I‚Äôm using 16.5 grams of espresso for a double shot.   When I start pulling the shot I start getting flow about 9 seconds into the shot and the shot takes about 28-30 seconds which seems reasonable.   But after pulling the shot my scale says 62 grams.   Shouldn‚Äôt it be around 2:1 or maybe 36 ounces or so?    Do I need to be stopping the shot early?    Or is this telling me I either need more ounces of coffee?   I was thinking that because my shot took 28-30 seconds which seems that the grind should be okay.   

Any ideas how to improve?

I am writing this in a coffee shop as I try my best not to burst in tears. I hate that you still have power over me. I hate that I can be your one call away but you are not mine. I hate that I can't hate you and despise all the things you did. But tonight, you hurt me yet again. You sent me a message. It was a simple request but it was a stab to my heart. Whenever I see your (used to be ours) cats, my heart melts and aches at the same time. I am slowly extinguishing this fire but you keep pulling me in and then pushing me down harder and harder every time. I am breaking down at your place while you are there with someone new in a place where I recommended. I hope you remember all of my plans for us and when you experience it with him, I hope you see my face in the crowd and ruin your day. Be original with your date plans. 

You told me last night that you knew that you caused all of the pain that I carry now. I really do hope you finally had the conscience to admit it and be more accountable for it. Please don't carry the same BS attitude. Your new lover doesn't deserve your ""cool"" and nonchalant persona. For now, let me extinguish this fire. I am no longer your moon that will reflect your bright sunlight. I am no longer the warmth to your cold night. You're just my eternal sunshine. I wish you well and take care always.

1jgjoa4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jgjoa4/hr_statues/,[HR] Statues,"Nick dumped his lukewarm mug of coffee into the kitchenette sink. Squirted some dish soap into it. Rinsed out the dregs. Dumped it. Rinsed it again. Dumped it again. Teetered it upside-down on the tines of the drying rack. Then he brushed his teeth. The dentist told him last year that he should start brushing his teeth after every cup of coffee. He brushed his teeth six times a day, some days.

He sauntered back to his desk, passing cubicle after empty cubicle. All his coworkers worked from home. Probably in their pyjamas. Nick was abandoned in the wasteland. Gluing envelope flaps. Toting parcels up to the mailroom. Raising a half-hearted salute to the lone mail clerk. The mail clerk never acknowledged him. She just wrinkled her brows at her screen, index finger poised at the ready above her computer mouse.

Nick pried his jacket from the wire hanger in his cubicle locker, number 10-42. He yanked his boots over his wool socks. Pulled his toque over his receding hairline. Closed his work laptop, unplugged it, and slid it neatly into his backpack. He left through the office door and went down the elevator. The glass elevator. Passing by floor after empty floor in the glass elevator. Down to the ground level. He waved goodbye to the security guard who was watching cooking tutorial videos on his phone. The guard didn‚Äôt look up.

Nick‚Äôs footsteps echoed in the atrium. A woman waited at the coffee counter at the far end of the atrium, hands in her jacket pockets. She was the only customer. Nick opened the steel door at the south corner of the atrium. He left the atrium. 
Nick entered the stairwell. The gross, dirty stairwell that smelled like piss. The stairwell that smelled like piss was his path to the building exit. He had gotten used to the smell. The piss smell.

A man sat limp at the bottom of the stairs, his body propped against the door to the outside. He wore a hooded jacket. The hood covered his face. His scraggly black beard that was streaked with gray poked out of the rim of the hood. His right hand lay upwards on the filthy tile next to a 7/11 Slurpee cup. Neon pink liquid oozed out of the cup. No, not oozed. It was done oozing. The pool had crusted around the cup. The man‚Äôs fingernails were neon pink. His fingertips were dirt brown. Nick wondered how the man could sleep through the piss smell. Maybe he had gotten used to the smell, like Nick had. Nick hardly smelled it at all, anymore.

Nick pushed his shoulder against the door‚Äôs panic bar. It swung open and a squall of chilled air wrapped itself around the stairwell. The errant receipts and condom wrappers and crumpled strips of tinfoil whorled across the floor with a chitter-chitter-chitter. The man fell forward onto his knees. He didn‚Äôt wake up. He didn‚Äôt stir. He didn‚Äôt do anything. Nick wondered if he was dead. 

Nick kept walking.

The cold was not so cold. Not as cold as this morning. Or was it yesterday morning? Whatever morning it was, that morning was cold. This cold was ‚Äòregular‚Äô cold. Nick pulled the hood of his jacket over his head. The fur of the hood lining tickled his eyelashes. Dry snowflakes caked the street like fresh dandruff. He waited at the crosswalk, shuffling his frozen legs back and forth like a sacred tribal dance. He glared at the neon-red hand of the pedestrian light, palm outwards in the universal sign for ‚ÄòStop‚Äô.

Nick felt a forceful tap on his shoulder. He nearly jumped out of his skin. 
A woman stood to his left, holding open a tattered cardboard box with a brand-new car radio tucked inside of a Styrofoam moulding, snug as a bug. Her pleading brown eyes begged Nick to consider the purchase. To consider how much more complete his life would feel if he had a shiny new (almost definitely stolen) car radio in his ten-year-old Nissan Sentra. But her eyes seemed to look right past him, through him, into him, like a human kaleidoscope. The woman‚Äôs queer half-smile flaunted her brown left incisor. Not just stained brown. Completely brown. Brown to the roots.

Nick waved his hand agitatedly, shaking his head no. He turned away from the woman and concentrated on the neon stop hand. Begging it to change. Feeling the woman‚Äôs gaze boring into his head.

The stoplight changed to the green walking-man. Nick walked. The woman did not.

Nick walked briskly across the street. He passed a construction worker leaning on his shovel, casually observing his coworker who knelt on one knee, eyebrows knitted, lips pursed, chin tucked, surveying some document on a clipboard. The man leaning on the shovel didn‚Äôt seem to notice the burger wrapper flapping under his steel-toed boot. An I-beam dangled above their heads and Nick thought about how unceremonious it would be if the tightly-wound steel cable were to snap and reduce each construction man into a melange of blood and bone and gristle. He thought about warning the two men but then thought better of it. They knew what they were doing. Who was he to say?

Nick approached the stairs of the train station entrance. He glanced towards the outdoor plaza that used to host concerts and street performers. It was empty now, as it had been for the last year or so. Nearly empty, that is. A young woman sat cross-legged in the middle of the plaza. She was wearing jeans with exaggerated rips at the knees and a graphic t-shirt with the words ‚ÄúFUCK YOUR PEACE‚Äù emblazoned over a bleeding crucifix. She held her clenched fist in the air, her arm perpendicular to the stolid tombstones of skyscrapers behind her. She gawked, slacked-jawed, at the gray sky. She had been still so long that snowflakes coated her knuckles and her unwashed hair. Nick could see it all the way from back here; white flecks dusted on her midnight-black braided hair, despite no snow having fallen all day. Nick studied her. Wondering how she wasn‚Äôt cold. Wondering whether someone had come by today and sprinkled snow onto her hand and hair. Wondering what could possibly possess her to be here, to sit there like that in the cold. 

He had only a moment to wonder. He heard the squeal of the train and the robotic voice announcing that the next train was bound for Burrard station. He rushed down the stairs that smelled slightly more of piss than the stairway of his office building, if one could believe it. He leapt over a pile of rags and blankets that might have encompassed a human being and yanked at the heavy steel door at the bottom of the stairway.

As he ran down the dilapidated and echoey underground tunnel that approached the station, Nick saw a man bent all the way over with his head tucked between his perfectly erect legs. The man leaned in front of a mud-streaked wall spray-painted with graffiti proclaiming ‚ÄòSandy J. iz a beotch‚Äô. The back of the man‚Äôs gloved left hand rested on the floor. His ungloved right hand clutched his ribcage. His knotted hair hid his face. His sweatpants had fallen halfway down his thighs. His underwear had a large tear along the waistband. Drugs, Nick thought. Must be drugs. What else but drugs?

Nick ran past the man, hugging the opposite wall, and slammed his shoulder against the train station door. The pneumatic cylinder screeched as the door swung wide, then sighed as it softly closed. Nick bolted to the ticket validation stand, fumbling at his coat pockets. He tore a ticket from the book folded in his wallet and jammed it into the machine. The machine, which usually stamped his ticket with a guttural ‚Äòtuh-chunk‚Äô, made no noise. The scratched-up digital display read ‚ÄòOUT OF SERVICE‚Äô. At that same moment, the telltale ‚Äòbing-bong, bing-bong‚Äô sound of the Burrard train leaving the station resonated through the cavernous interior. Nick sighed and stowed the unvalidated ticket back in his wallet, comforted in the knowledge that the peace officers who used to patrol the stations for fare-dodgers had all but abandoned the transit system. He vaulted over the turnstile, looking over his shoulder in embarrassment, then trudged down the stairwell to the platform. His boots left neat, wet impressions on the stairs. He hopped over the step with vomit splattered on it, so old and dry that you could have swept it up with a brush and dustpan.

People waited on benches at the train station, those going northbound sitting this way, southbound sitting that. Nick took a seat with the northbounds, wedged between a rail-thin man in a safety vest and a recycling bin. Nick rubbed his aching temples. 

An empty Coke can hit Nick‚Äôs shoulder, clanged off the recycling bin, and went rolling down onto the tracks. He whirled around, looking for the culprit, expecting someone, anyone, to cop to throwing it. To either hold their hands up apologetically or cross their arms defiantly. No one looked at him. They were either staring at their phones or at their boots or at the sucking abyss of the train tunnel. 

Nick started to doubt whether he had actually been hit with the Coke can. He fought an urge to rush to the tracks, just to see it, to make sure he could trust his own senses. And if that can was there, boy, there would be a show. He would reach right down and grab that can and hold himself an old-fashioned citizen‚Äôs interrogation. He would make them listen. He would make them sit up and pay attention. He would find out who threw it and make them pay. It was probably one of those southbounds who threw it. Those goddamned southbounds.

Jesus, I‚Äôm really losing it, he thought.

Nick pulled his book from his backpack, one of his ‚Äòairport‚Äô mystery novels that Jillian was always teasing him about. He set his bookmark on top of the recycling bin and stared at the pages. He didn‚Äôt read the book. Just stared at the indecipherable black and white letters until his eyes glazed over and the words became bleary lines that pulsed in time with the throbbing vein on his forehead. When the next Burrard train came, the northbounds got on. Nick, in his stupor, almost missed this train too. He slapped his book shut and squeezed through the automatic closing doors.

There weren‚Äôt many northbounds these days. Maybe two or three to a car. The people in Nick's car were already settled into their seats, still studying their phones and their boots. Nick picked the seat furthest from the others. Well, second furthest. The furthest was too nasty to sit on. As the train squealed to a juddering start, Nick glimpsed the bookmark that he had left on the recycling bin through the window. He peered down at his closed book and shoved it into his backpack. He noticed a crumpled sheet of tinfoil next to the sole of his shoe. It was stained powdery white in the middle. He thought about scooping it up and licking it, but he closed his eyes instead.

Glenwild station passed. Then Perth. McKinnon. North Campus. Livett Plaza. Finally:

‚ÄúBurrard Station,‚Äù said the computer-man over the intercom. ‚ÄúThis is the last station. All passengers must disembark. This train is no longer in service.‚Äù

When Nick opened his eyes, he wasn‚Äôt surprised to see that he was the only one left in the car. He stepped out and crossed the street. He passed the rows of buses idling by the curb, grim-faced drivers counting down the clock until it was time for their circuitous route to start again. Nick slogged through the snowy field towards his apartment, following someone else‚Äôs foot treads. Or maybe they were his own foot treads from yesterday. Yesterday, when it was colder than today. The footprints didn‚Äôt look fresh. These could have been his own footprints.
Nick slid his key into the front door of his apartment building. The latch always stuck when it was cold. He had to jiggle the handle several times before it opened. He walked past an elderly woman leaning against a walker with a basket attached to front. The basket was filled to the brim with plastic grocery bags tied tight by the handles.

Nick nodded his head at her. He got the expected non-response. Some awful smell was coming out of those grocery bags. Or from the woman herself. Christ, old age is a bitch, he thought. Nick trotted to the elevator, pushed the ‚ÄòUP‚Äô button, and waited, his boots dripping slush onto the rust-orange carpet. 

Nick rode the elevator up to the fourth floor, pounded the sloppy snow off his boots on the welcome mat outside apartment 4-C, and unlocked the door.

‚ÄúHi, honey, how was work?‚Äù 

Finally, Nick thought. Jillian‚Äôs voice, muffled from behind the half-closed door of the ‚Äòhome office‚Äô doubling as a storage closet, was sweet music to his ears.

‚ÄúIt was fine,‚Äù he called, setting his backpack on the door hook and stepping out of his boots. He cleared his throat, realizing he hadn‚Äôt spoken a single word to anyone all day.

‚ÄúAre you sure? You don‚Äôt sound so sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶‚Äù Nick let his jacket fall from his shoulders to the ground.  ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶one of those days, ya know? One that doesn‚Äôt feel right. The whole day, it didn't feel right. Nothing happened. Nothing is wrong. It just‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt feel right, is all.‚Äù

‚ÄúAww, I‚Äôm sorry, babe. I made dinner for you. It‚Äôs on top of the oven.‚Äù

Nick shambled into the kitchenette and saw a casserole dish. It was full of mac and cheese with golden breadcrumbs baked on top. He held his hand over the dish. The food was lukewarm. A clean serving spoon lay next to the dish.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt eat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt hungry yet,‚Äù Jillian‚Äôs sing-song voice called. Nick thought it held a false note. Not sinister. No, definitely not sinister. Just false.

Nick walked on the balls of his feet to the office door. The lights were off inside the office. The blue-white glow of the computer screen reflected Jillian‚Äôs shadow from the bottom of the left-hand wall nearly to the ceiling. 

Nick held his hand up to the half-closed door, ready to swing it open. To see his wife. ‚ÄúJill?‚Äù 
He imagined that he heard a dry, shifting crunch.  Like a bundle of celery twisting minutely. Like a concrete slab that had learned how to breathe.

The shadow on the wall didn‚Äôt move. Nick didn‚Äôt think that it did. 

‚ÄúYes, hon?‚Äù

Nick waited. Waited for Jillian to break the silence. When she didn‚Äôt, he lowered his hand from the door. 

‚ÄúNothing, honey. I‚Äôm going to go lie down. Come get me when you‚Äôre hungry. We can eat together.‚Äù 

Nick waited again. 

Jillian said nothing. She was probably just deep in thought. Working at whatever she worked at on the computer. That was probably it.

Nick crept into their bedroom and shut the door silently. Jillian had made the bed. Sheets tucked tight, creaseless. It was like a bed in a showhome. Like a bed no one had ever slept in before. Nick flipped on the bedside table lamp and then lay on top of the duvet, not daring to disturb the bedspread too much. The table lamp flickered.

Nick waited. Waited to hear Jillian‚Äôs office chair creak as she got up from her desk. Waited to hear her open the microwave oven and pop in the casserole dish with the mac and cheese and busy herself with wiping down the already-spotless counters. Waited for her to open the bedroom door and smile at him and ask him if he was hungry yet and reassure him that yes, he was really here, he was really really here, of course you‚Äôre really here, you big galoot, you big dummy, you big, big dummy galoot. Yes, of course, I‚Äôm here too. You can be so strange, sometimes, Nicky-boy. You can be so, so strange, sometimes, Nicky-boy.

Hi Redditors, 


Firstly; I want to say thank you to those who have left me helpful insights and advice. Some comments were hard to hear but I needed to be real with myself and see it for what it is. 

I have said all that I needed to say to my husband (thank you guys for your comments). Right now; he is trying to be nice  (he made my coffee in the morning before I leave for work and cleaned the kitchen, etc.) I have noticed a pattern where he does nice things after knowing he messed up. I refused to engage and kept my distance since the incident so he gets the message loud and clear. 

As for the interview outcome, I have good news! I was invited for another interview as the next step in the process. I will of course schedule my interview where my husband is not around. I will also not tell him about this next interview either. 

Thank you again for your support :)

\-----

I have won a lot of free ""coffee"" from the Tim's Roll Up To Win contest. More than I would ever consume. Unfortunately, can't send the offer to others so I have to d the order for you.

From now to noon,  Mar 21, 2025 (today), I will order for you¬†**up to 2**¬†hot beverages. This includes modifications such as extra toppings/syrups for free. Again, HOT beverage. Not cold beverages such as ice capp, donuts, or sandwiches!

**If you want plain ""brewed coffee"". Don't bother!** Make it at home I won't order it for you¬† Might as well get the maximum value out of this.

For those that think this is a scam you can check my previous post history as I've given away LOTS of movie tickets multiple times in previous years.

Rules:

1. only contact via chat from now to noon, other times will be ignored. I will try to respond as soon as i can but things happen or I'm in the middle of another order
2. posted in Regina sub so only Regina locations.
3. ideally, once we start the chat you should head over to the location as if it is popular there will be many orders with the same name (as I'm not changing my Tims' account name after each order)
4. I reserve the right to ignore you if I feel like you're just trolling me or making me waste an order/time
5. Don't blame me if they make your order wrong... even if it is my mistake :) You get what you pay for.

Also get me as much order details as possible in your initial chat. ie. exact menu item name, size, dairy, sweetener, toppings, espresso shots, etc. If not I will just leave the default values as is.

(Get new donor bonus money) Use the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! I will educate you about plasma. Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I had one shot immediately I knew he's getting atleast 16 shots per patch and I've just fucked up and had too much. I felt the rush but was more consumed with the dread of my impending doom, thinking I would drop any second.. I tried to compose myself by walking around the coffee table in the lounge and trying to stay vertical the first lap when I passed the curved ""found"" mirror, I felt something but didn't really register as I was consumed by the overdose situation but the next lap as I passed the mirror, from the corner of my eye I saw something.

Then the main one of the three and the first to exit the mirror, stopped circling me, looked me in the eyes then pierced my body (soul) going right through me lifting me up like a kick to the guts and leaving me a good meter off the ground before falling like a sack of shit to the floor. 
There was no sign of these ""thing's and I was left hysterical alone on the floor suprisingly sober considering how much Fentanyl I had I'm not sure if it was a NDE, a visit from Demon's or Ginn's..IDK.

1jgjhtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/frenchcafecroissant/comments/1jgjhtj/pass√©_compos√©_vs_imparfait_here_are_my_tips/,Pass√© compos√© vs imparfait - Here are my tips!,"Hi everyone!  
I‚Äôm French, and I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of **French learners** at some point say something like:

>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get when to use pass√© compos√© or imparfait. It feels random.‚Äù

I really get why it feels that way. The rules you find in textbooks are often too vague (*‚Äúone is for completed actions, one is for descriptions‚Äù* okay, cool, but that doesn‚Äôt help when you‚Äôre telling a story).

So here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd **explain it if you were my friend**, over a coffee, not in a classroom:

**üëâ Pass√© compos√© = something happens**  
Boom. It happened. It started, it ended. You‚Äôre moving the story forward.  
*J‚Äôai mang√© une pizza.* ‚Üí The action exists, it happened, we‚Äôre done.

**üëâ Imparfait = background**  
It sets the scene, gives context, tells us how things *were* at that moment.  
*Il pleuvait.* = It was raining. It doesn‚Äôt move the story forward. It‚Äôs just there.

Now combine them, and you get something like:

>Il pleuvait quand je suis sorti.  
(It was raining when I went out.)

‚Üí The rain is the background (imparfait), me going out is the action that happens (pass√© compos√©).  
You can almost feel the **camera angle change**.

üé• **Another tip I give is to imagine a film scene.**  
Imparfait = what we see in the background  
Pass√© compos√© = what the camera zooms in on

>J‚Äô√©tais fatigu√©, alors j‚Äôai pris un caf√©.  
I was tired (background), so I took a coffee (action).

Of course there are tricky cases (vouloir, savoir, √™tre...) but if you think in terms of ‚Äúcamera movement‚Äù I think it could help a lot. Don't hesitate if you have any questions, maybe I or someone else could answer you!

By the way, I built a tool to help you **learn French** by listening to our **French podcast** with a **live transcription** that highlights each word as it's spoken, maybe you‚Äôll find it useful!

MiracleBeliever

# 1.0 out of 5 stars Works exactly as described online, BUT would NOT buy (explained hereinbelow) 

Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2025Amazon Vine Customer Review of Free Product( [What's this?](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/vine/help?ie=UTF8) )This is a COMPARATIVE review of TWO (2) functionally-equivalent items:  
  
ITEM 1 \[ASIN B0DPWS47H8; amazon(dot)com/dp/B0DPWS47H8\]  
\-- Coffee SCOOP has ca. 45mm OD and holds ca. 27mL of water  
(bottom TAMPER has ca. 41mm OD).  
and  
ITEM 2 \[ASIN B0DSKD79LR; amazon(dot)com/dp/B0DSKD79LR\]  
\-- Coffee SCOOP has ca. 38mm OD and holds ca. 22mL of water.  
  
==========  
Please note that a Nespresso Vertuo 7.77oz pod  
has ca. 47mm ID and holds ca. 36mL of water.  
==========  
  
BOTTOMLINE CONCLUSION:  
Even though both items work just fine (exactly as described online),  
it‚Äôs a phenomenal WASTE of one‚Äôs time and energy to use  
either ITEM 1 or ITEM 2, especially since  
  
(i) it‚Äôs labor-INTENSIVE and  
  
(ii) one MUST first remove the used-pod‚Äôs aluminum foil AND then  
  
(iii) wash & dry the used pods (for health & safety) and then,  
  
(iv) because of the CRUCIAL restrictions imposed by  
Nespresso VERTUO‚Äôs CENTRIFUSION technology  
\[tinyurl(dot)com/3j3xwwmh ; tinyurl(dot)com/yapkuuse\],  
one MUST refill the used pods with EXACTLY THE CORRECT  
AMOUNT AND CORRECT TYPE/GRIND OF COFFEE and then  
  
(v) seal the used, REFILLED pods CORRECTLY and  
  
(vi) (most importantly) I greatly prefer the taste and aroma of  
freshly-brewed coffee made by using ‚ÄúTurkish Grandma‚Äôs‚Äù super-easy,  
labor-free, microwave-brewing method <detailed at tinyurl(dot)com/3jxj3v2m>  
instead of any other coffeemaking process \[including Nespresso, Keurig,  
Drip, Pour-Over, Percolator, Stovetop (Moka Pot), Single-Serve Capsule,  
French Press, and Espresso Coffee Makers\].  
  
==========  
Please note that I was GIFTED my Nespresso Vertuo machine and  
would NOT have ever purchased one nor paid $1.30 per pod for coffee  
that (to me) NEVER tastes as good as ‚ÄúTurkish Grandma‚Äôs‚Äù coffee.  
  
Moreover, I was going to DONATE my Nespresso Vertuo machine  
as soon as I finished all the coffee pods I had been GIFTED,  
but I decided to try BOTH ITEM 1 & ITEM 2 in order to determine  
whether or not they offer any benefit over ‚ÄúTurkish Grandma‚Äôs‚Äù super-easy,  
labor-free, microwave-brewing method <detailed at tinyurl(dot)com/3jxj3v2m>.  
\-- They do NOT.  
==========  
  
Nonetheless, I will detail hereinbelow the pros & cons  
of ITEM 1 & ITEM 2.  
  
1. REMOVAL OF USED POD‚Äôs ALUMINUM FOIL LIDS.  
  
ITEM 1‚Äôs ‚ÄúINTEGRATED BLADE DESIGN‚Äù is outstanding,  
making it trivially-easy to accurately remove the entire  
USED aluminum foil lids from the USED pods.  
\-- A big POSITIVE.  
  
ITEM 2‚Äôs SEPARATE (not integrated) manual-blade-cutter  
does NOT enable the accurate removal of the entire  
USED aluminum foil lids from the USED pods.  
\-- A NEGATIVE.  
  
2. REFILLING WASHED PODS WITH COFFEE  
  
ITEM 1‚Äôs Coffee SCOOP‚Äôs ca. 45mm OD is TOO LARGE  
to enable NEATLY filling with coffee the ca. 47mm ID  
Nespresso Vertuo 7.77oz pod.  
Moreover, the design of the TAMPER (included on the opposite end  
of ITEM 1‚Äôs Coffee SCOOP) hooks/disperses some coffee grounds (somewhat messy).  
\-- Both NEGATIVES.  
  
ITEM 2‚Äôs Coffee SCOOP‚Äôs ca. 38mm OD is adequately-sized  
to enable NEATLY filling with coffee the ca. 47mm ID  
Nespresso Vertuo 7.77oz pod.  
\-- A POSITIVE.  
  
3. SEALING REFILLED PODS  
  
ITEM 1‚Äôs alignment guides (for the self-adhesive Aluminum Foil Lids)  
are not very helpful, necessitating eyeballing for centering.  
\-- A NEGATIVE.  
  
ITEM 2‚Äôs alignment guides (for the self-adhesive Aluminum Foil Lids)  
are also not very helpful, necessitating eyeballing for centering  
(but slightly more helpful than ITEM 1‚Äôs alignment guides). .  
\-- A NEGATIVE.

My Heart? In the pits of hell...

Because I have 10 days until the end of my term to pass these remaining tasks and C-777.

I've been working towards this moment for over 10 years. A lot of things have happened during that time (from deployments to Afghanistan and Kuwait to playing overseas basketball). Life will ask you ""what is your dream"", then give you plenty of chances to prove you will fight for it!

I'm just here to offer some encouragement to the Night Owl that hasn't logged in since October. I see you. I am you. You can do this. Take it one day at a time. One class - one task. You'll find your rhythm! 

Anyway, through it all, 2 Owls have remained by my side. The GREAT Sage and Duo ""Did you forget about me"" Lingo.

I‚Äôd love a partner who enjoys traveling, gaming, and just experiencing life together. Let‚Äôs build something real.","Hello, and thanks for reading my post!

A bit about me‚ÄîI‚Äôm single, Hispanic, no kids, just a cat and some fish. Fitness is a big part of my life, and I‚Äôd love to meet someone who shares that passion. I enjoy cooking, traveling, reading books and manga, and gaming on PC and Switch. Nature is my escape‚ÄîI love hiking, camping, and exploring natural landmarks.

I speak four languages (two natively, two I‚Äôve learned or am learning). Gardening is another passion of mine, and I dream of one day being self-sufficient with a homestead. I can go on and on, so feel free to ask me anything when we chat!

A few things about my lifestyle‚ÄîI don‚Äôt smoke or use stimulants (besides coffee). I‚Äôm not into clubbing or drinking unless it‚Äôs in a private setting, and even then, it‚Äôs rare. I‚Äôm direct and honest, a bit reserved with strangers but completely open with my partner. Affection is very important to me‚Äîphysical closeness and touch are essential.
What I‚Äôm Looking For

    Consistency, honesty, and communication‚Äîthese are key.
    Someone who wants kids and holds traditional values when it comes to dating and roles. (You can work if you want, but not because you have to.)
    I‚Äôd love a partner who enjoys cooking together and someone who is capable and self-sufficient.
    I‚Äôm old-fashioned in romance‚ÄîI open doors, show affection openly, and have a bit of a possessive, protective streak when it comes to my partner.
    I prefer someone needy, who craves attention, affection, and praise. I give my all to my partner and family, so I want someone who thrives on closeness and daily intimacy‚Äîsharing meals, sleeping together every night, and being each other‚Äôs safe space.

Physical & Lifestyle Preferences

    I‚Äôm generally drawn to Asian or Hispanic partners but am open to other backgrounds if we click.
    More than anything, I value compatibility and a partner who complements my life.
    I‚Äôm willing to travel or relocate to be with the right person‚Äîeven the idea of being a nomadic couple sounds exciting!

My cat is chronically constipated so my last vet had me put her on 1/4 tsp of miralax and put her on wet food. My other cat gets UTI so our last vet also had us switch out cat water to bottled spring water instead of tap.

I am not a vet. But I like to learn and understand things. So today I took my 15 year old cat to the new vet for what I was suspecting is diabetes. She's the one that gets constipated. 

She's not a fat cat, but she has been voraciously hungry lately. When she gives me kisses, her tongue is noticeably cool like she's been drinking cool water. This only happens when she's begging for food and hasn't eaten in a bit. 

She also has started vomiting on my bed each morning. I feed her her wet food at 11:30 at night and by the morning at like 8am, she is vomiting and there is nothing in her stomach but water. So I have to wake up at 4am-6am to feed her and then she doesn't throw up.

So.

The new vet sees my 15 year old cat today about the vomiting. He doesn't think she has diabetes, but he's going to have me collect a urine sample and check her anyway. He's not sure what is causing the vomiting. But he said the cool tongue is normal (my cat licks for affection and to beg for food, the cool tongue is noticeable and new.) He doesn't want me to keep my cat on miralax for constipation and has adviced me to feed her milk twice a day.

This has me concerned. He told me the fats in milk soften the stool and is nature's laxative. He told me whole milk or half and half, but to start with whole milk. 

Well. That's not right? It's not fats that cause soft stool, but an intolerance to lactose. At least that's my understanding. So that was a bit of a flag for me.

Secondly he told me to take my cat off wet food. He said there was no reason my cat couldn't eat the dry Hills C/D Multicare that my other cat was on. He said research shows that dry food causes cats to drink more water and therefore is fine for them to be on, even if they have constipation issues.

And lastly. He wants me to put my cats on distilled water. He said that spring water was no good because of the minerals and that they should drink purely distilled water. This also raised a flag to me. We always have distilled water for coffee (our tap is hard water) so Ive considered putting the cats on it in the past, just because we have it on hand. But when I looked it up, sites said not to because the acid in distilled water could throw off the ph of my cats and cause urinary issues, which one of my cats already struggles with.

I just don't know about this vet. He seems nice and very conscientious of spending my money, but also a bit misinformed. He's an elderly gentlemen.

Could any vets give me a bit of feedback regarding this visit with him. Am I misinformed? I know I don't have the expertise he has, so maybe I'm just not knowledgeable enough to understand his reasoning.",3,1742570453.0,AskVet,8,1.0,False

It's year 45.4. The lifeforms of your very own planet, Earth, finally became sapient.

Now all you need to do is to watch them grow.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rules:

Your main goal is to let the very first kingdom to establish a colony on Pluto.

Do NOT give humans any resources. You can terraform(change the biome, plant plants, spawn animals, demolish geysers, and change the landscape) a planet where humans lasted for 30 years, but don't give them any resources.

You have one single chance to spawn 50 humans on established colonies.

You have one single chance to power-up, or give coffee to humans. The amount of people you give effect to doesn't matter.

You get a chance to use the atomic bombs ONLY 3 TIMES after your most populated kingdom's culture reaches level 35. Use it wisely.

You can only terraform the Moon, Mars, Venus, Ceres, Jupiter and Saturn's moons.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Challenge:

Giant leap for mankind - Let the humanity to colonize the Moon.

Acid lover - Let the colony on Io thrive for 30 years and terraform Io.

End? - Win the game.

Expander - Let the humanity to colonize every planets and moons.

The figma_agent.exe that wants to call home was created ‚Äéand modified March ‚Äé20, ‚Äé2025 and lives in its own folder. Each Figma version has historicallyy had its own Figma agent in the resources folder where that version of Figma is installed.

```
2021-08-18 Installed Figma 99.0.0 on Windows 10.
2021-08-18 Figma.EXE and Update.EXE created.
2022-01-05 Updated to Figma 107.1.0.0.
2022-01-05 Figma.EXE and Update.EXE modified.

2025-03-21 Figma Agent installed as independent app.
2025-03-21 Figma Agent wants to call home.
```

So what has changed, and why does it want to call home? Why now? After all this time? Note that I don't even use Figma anymore. I should have uninstalled it already. But I neglected and now it wants to take some kind of action on my computer, even though I no longer use it and I haven't touched it in months if not years.

OpenCoffee clubs were a great way to connect Bricks 'n Mortar communities to the online world and help them grow.

OpenCoffee is a social club for business owners that usually happens int he m iddle of the day that is inconvenient for employees but convenient for business owners to get together. you dont need structure, but you can provide structured events like BizCamps, UnConferences and informal talks from tech leaders, visionaires, successful entrepreneurs.

There's no need to provide networking - its not competitive with BNI and other formal outcome-focused clubs. 

Its an un-club. It figures that people who are self employed will figure it out.

Why is this relevant to SEO?

Its a great way for companies in a geo-location to get to know each other, share ideas, LINK to each other.

Everything from plumbers, insurance, retail, food, SaaS, to promote each other on Social Media and via blogging.

This is a great role for an SEO, Web Agency, SoMe Agency, Local agency, whatever to organze,

Other similar clubs are Tech Week, BTW (blogger, twitter, whatever) - informal get togethers for people expanding their digital footprint.

This is a great way to establish online authority by mirroring real life connections

The person conducting the experiment used WHOOP, Oura, and a self-tracking app to measure changes in cognitive and physiological markers over a two-month period, including a baseline phase and a return-to-baseline phase.

# Experiment Setup:

* **Baseline Period:** One week on regular coffee
* **Intervention:** One month on the nootropic coffee
* **Return to Baseline:** One month back on regular coffee

# Key Results:

* **Agitation decreased by 34%** (*p = 0.0015*) ‚Äì Reported feeling calmer throughout the day.
* **HRV increased by 13%** (*p = 0.0041*) ‚Äì Suggests improved autonomic regulation.
* **Flow state increased by 18%** (*p = 0.0257*) ‚Äì Felt more absorbed in deep work sessions.
* **Work enjoyment increased by 15%** (*p = 0.0172*) ‚Äì Noted increased motivation and engagement.
* **Working memory improved by 10%** (*p = 0.0323*) ‚Äì Reported improved recall and focus.

# Limitations & Considerations:

* **Not blinded** ‚Äì The participant knew what they were drinking, which could introduce bias.
* **Single-person study** ‚Äì These results may not generalize.
* **No standardized cognitive tests** ‚Äì Future studies could incorporate formal memory and attention assessments.

The results suggest potential benefits, but more data is needed given the small sample size and lack of blinding. Still, it was interesting to see self-tracking tools capture measurable changes.

Disclaimer: I play exclusively on PS4/PS5  
I've been a big fan of the Tropico series with 6 being my favorite. With that being said I've been reading a lot of post here and other places and see a lot of advocating for Plantation modes to be at Multiculture. I understand the boost to nearby Plantations for different crops. However I've very rarely played a game using Multiculture. Not that I haven't tried. 

Reasons why:

1. Usually in colonial times I'm trying to generate as much income at minimum cost. So Mainly sugar plantations for Rum. With the occasional Coffee plantation if its market value is high. I do however understand the value in creating plantations to support future era industries. If workforce and finance permitting I may do this.  

2. Fertility, There is a lot of instances in which I don't see the ability to add multiple plantations of different resources close to each other just for the simple reality that the area wont support it. I'll only create a plantation if the fertility allows 80% at minimal. Usually I'm looking for the upper 90 percentile range. So in general I rarely see an opportunity to add multiple different plantations with good fertility levels in proximity to each other.   

3. Manure spreading, Usually I'll keep a manure spreader for every two Plantations while staying in Mono. This encourages me to keep creating farms which helps with food for my population as well as supports industries. This also buys me time before I'm ready to build grocery stores. 



So I just wanted to get some feedback on why Multiculture is more of the preference then Mono as I feel as I must be missing something.

I have done this once before about 10 years ago, but it was more focused on consistent exercise (specifically running) on top of a relatively ‚Äúactive‚Äù lifestyle. This time (with the help of technology) I tried to focus more on an intentional calorie deficit, and more modest exercise (at least 10k steps daily by walking). I had previously thought, like many other people, that you HAD to exercise to lose weight. And since I‚Äôm already active, it would mean running, or a commitment to the gym.

Analyzing my diet was interesting because I considered myself to have a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù diet by most standards - almost no fast food or take-out, no sugar added drinks, other than coffee once per day, etc. I was surprised I was able to cut my carbs and sugar intake in half simply by taking out certain things like oatmeal with banana, switching certain fruits for snacks, and limiting dessert/sweets.

I have been averaging about 12k steps daily, and burning 2,600-3,100 calories daily, while only consuming about 1,800 calories daily.

The results have been losing approximately 12lbs over 6 weeks. Definitively 10lbs in 4.5 weeks. From the low 180s to 169lbs, today.

My ideal weight is approximately 165. My question is that at this pace and plan, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm particularly straining in terms of eating. I‚Äôm not overly hungry at different times, and I‚Äôm eating less carefully on weekends currently. So, i don‚Äôt know how to make up the calorie deficit once I reach my goal weight.

1jgiwb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SadhguruTruth/comments/1jgiwb5/fun_a_typical_day_of_an_isha_meditator/,[Fun] A typical day of an Isha meditator,"This is a comment I love from the old Guruphiliac forum. The context is that a user ‚ÄúBillybob‚Äù (presumably a Jaggi devotee) admonishes ex-devotees in the forum to ‚Äúget a life‚Äù. User ‚Äúpaulpembroke‚Äù responds in this super funny way on how their life would be if they go back to Isha. The practices described are from 2012, but the general sketch is still very true of how die-hard Isha devotees spend their life! Enjoy the read! 


Aum Namo Bhagavate BillyBob!

You‚Äôre right, I do need to get a life, so, I decided to begin doing the isha practices again. 

5:20 a.m.‚Äì 10 ‚Äì minutes of guru puja
5:30 a.m.‚Äì 45 minutes of shakti chalana kriya (let‚Äôs not focus on the fact that in yoga there‚Äôs no such practice as shakti chalana kriya, but there is a shakti chalana mudra which is very much different from what jaggie calls shakti chalana kriya.  We‚Äôll leave that point for now because who care if yogic practices are authentic or fabricated).
6:20 a.m. 10 ‚Äì 15 minutes of poornami practice, the famous flesh eating meditation or coffee sipping meditation described previously on this site and Zaysens site.
6:35 a.m.‚Äì 40 minutes of breath watching meditation. 


I'm finished with yoga practices for now and have to wait 15-20 minutes before eating or drinking so as not to disturb the energy generated by the practices. 


Now, I have to be to work at and I have a minimum 45 minute drive to work.  If traffic is heavy or there are accidents on the way, as often happens, I‚Äôll be late.  But, not to worry; my tardiness is because of my noble yoga practices and pursuit of enlightenment which when attained at some point in the future will benefit all beings and all creation.  Yes, my employer will certainly cut me some slack and understand that I need special exceptions because I‚Äôm practicing yoga.  Most employer are like that, right?


What‚Äôs that you say?  Start earlier so I can get to work on time?  I‚Äôve thought of that but that darn flesh eating meditation has to be done at 6:20 a.m., precisely at 6:20 a.m.   It‚Äôs required.  So, even if I start my routine earlier that requirement really throws the timing off.  Although, I could just get another job that doesn‚Äôt require me to start my shift until say 8:30 a.m.  Yes, I‚Äôll search for another job that fits my yoga routine.  Until then I‚Äôll have to rely on divine grace ‚Äì mahima, right? ‚Äì to explain things to my current employer.  Divine grace can explain more convincingly than me if I only surrender.


Ok, I‚Äôve worked for several hours in the morning and now it‚Äôs time for shoonya meditation, 15 minutes, give or take several minutes.  No need to quibble over time on shoonya because it ends all on its own.  Jaggie makes sure it ends on its own because he‚Äôs put stops on it so people don‚Äôt get into trouble with it.  He still tells the story of competing meditators and the dangers of sitting for shoonya for too long, doesn‚Äôt he?


After shoonya I eat lunch.  I don‚Äôt get as long for lunch because I‚Äôve spent ¬º of my time meditating but that doesn‚Äôt matter because shoonya really balances me and centers me.  No matter that now I have to rush around more than otherwise to get, eat and finish lunch and be back to work on time; the shoonya made me more relaxed for 15 minutes and at some time in the future I‚Äôll be enlightened for the good of all creation.


When I get home from work I‚Äôll sit for another 15 minutes of shoonya meditation before eating and interacting with my family because shoonya should be done on a somewhat empty stomach, 1 ¬Ω hours minimum since eating, is that right?  Oh, yeah, after shoonya, I should do the hatha yoga too because that needs to be done on an empty stomach and if I eat dinner after shoonya then I have to wait 4 hours before doing hatha yoga and, that would be probably 10:00 at night or later.  Hatha yoga at at 10:00 at night would stimulate my nervous system and keep me up all night, and I go to sleep at 10:00, so that‚Äôs not an option.  So, I do hatha yoga after evening shoonya and that takes a minimum of 1 hour, but, if I do it slowly and consciously as it‚Äôs taught, it‚Äôs actually 1 ¬Ω hours or even close to 2 hours.  Not quite 2 hours but close. 


Then after the hatha yoga I should do the shambavi maha mudra and that‚Äôs another 21 minutes.  I asked Senthil if shambavi was necessary with all the other stuff I was doing and he told me that since jaggi taught it to me I should do it because, I wouldn‚Äôt want to waste his time teaching me, did I?  So, it‚Äôs shambavi after hatha yoga.  It‚Äôs just about 8:00 p.m. now, I just finished shambavi and I can eat.  My family has already eaten but no matter, I‚Äôm doing my yoga practices and pursuing my enlightenment.  Maybe now I‚Äôm unavailable for them and very distant from them but, one day, they‚Äôll thank me.  Yes, when I‚Äôm enlightened, they‚Äôll thank me.


It‚Äôs about 8:30 p.m. and I‚Äôve finished eating.  Now I can talk and do stuff with my spouse and children  for ¬Ω an hour because I go to sleep at 10:00 p.m. and, I have the samyama practice to do for an hour before going to sleep so I have to start that at 9:00 p.m.


Yes, that‚Äôs the constructive life you‚Äôve inspired me to have, billybob.  Thank you so much for giving me the clarity to see how much better and happier I and my family will be.  It‚Äôs not so bad on the weekends because I don‚Äôt have to work.  I still have to interrupt my family and household activities for shoonya and all the other practices that have to be planned meticulously around eating times but there‚Äôs more leeway on the weekends.  Except Sunday.  Sunday is the day I have to do both hatha yoga routines, you know, all of the postures and the 12 sun salutations.  That only takes about 3 hours on Sunday in addition to all of the other practices.  But, really, it makes me happy and joyful.  My family commitments?  Well, those commitments were made before I got involved with isha but, the isha commitments are the real commitments.  My marriage vows and my commitment to my children were just practice commitments.  They aren‚Äôt nearly as important as my isha commitment, right??  I mean, isha will get me enlightened some day in the future and the whole world will thank me, right??  But being sincerely and genuinely involved with my spouse and children, well, that‚Äôs not as important as enlightenment and isha.


And that brings up another point I want to tell you about.  I‚Äôve committed to donating money to isha again.  I can‚Äôt really afford it but I‚Äôm committed to it.  Yes, my spouse doesn‚Äôt like it because we should be saving for retirement and we could use it for things for the children, school activities etc. but they aren‚Äôt as important as contributing to isha and jaggi to make sure it survives because isha and jaggi are making the world a better place, planting trees etc.  Me and my family really aren‚Äôt as important as isha and jaggi, so I‚Äôm committed to donating to them. I‚Äôm really committed, not just a practice commitment like my marriage and my family committments, but really committed to making sure that I financially support jaggi and make sure has has what he wants and needs.


So, billybob, thanks very much for giving me the correct perspective and admonishing me to get a life.  The isha life is blissful.  You can use this as an advertisement to prospective students.  I‚Äôm certain when they read what‚Äôs expected of them you‚Äôll triple or even quadruple your enrollments.  Anything I can do to help you out.

Have a good day.

1jgitrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1jgitrv/went_to_a_job_orientation_for_2_days_and_it/,"Went to a job orientation for 2 days, and it changed my perspective on my past 3 years of unemployment","The past 3 years, I never held a regular job though I have done part time work, went to community college with online classes part time, and did part time training program. So semi-NEET. Nothing near 30 hours of work a week, only 20 hours a week at most if even that. But I spent most of my months unemployed with absolutely no commitments. There were a lot of days where I didn't even leave my apartment unit. I dropped all my friends because I had the resource to.

People would judge me if they found out, and I thought of how much money I could be earning and saving if I had a regular job (I applied but didn't get interviews for the degree I studied for) and had the NEET shame.

I am technically a physically disabled NEET with mental health issues. I finally got an interview and got hired at a part time basis. I am surprised I even got hired (I didn't disclose my disabilities of course). We did a 2 day orientation with 8 hours each where we sat through powerpoints. I had to arrive to the office at 8am and left at like 4pm.

And you know what? That changed my perspective on the past 3 years. It wasn't a waste. It's so much more preferable than the 40+ hours a week that most Americans work at a job they don't even care about. I loved not having an obligation the next morning, waking up whenever I want (though I still woke up at 6am-9am and went to bed at 10pm-12pm like a normie). My time is mine. Chill mornings with decaf coffee. I believe everyone is a morning person if they don't have to rush. I've been in the best shape of my life, I am not fat due to lack of stress and sleep deprivation, I have muscles because I have time to work out and eat properly. I had the time to focus on my issues, do therapy (if you are in the US, don't get a normie therapist, get the underground ones that you have to pay out of pocket for and do Neville Goddard's revision therapy, most US therapists are bullshit and the actual good ones do not take insurance), do physical therapy to deal with injuries (which is why I lost my last job).",1,1742569214.0,CasualConversation,3,1.0,False

(Get new donor bonus money) Use the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! I will educate you about plasma. Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\
https://rewards.cslplasma.com/referral/referral-unique-code/eyJkb25vcklEIjoiMTMwMTkyMTciLCJjb2RlIjoiQVlMR1k1NERBRyJ9\
\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I have had the same ""random"" background image on 2 phones, my computer and laptop. The same 5 repeating images for about a month now. android apps like resplash no longer work and wont be updated, with comments from their devs saying the new api is terrible. 

  
the images now are 100% biased towards this strange fake multi-culture theme. I have had the same 4k image of a women in africa with a basket on her head loop endlessly infront of me in the api toolkit. it will give ""random"" images, but those images wont contain anything to do with Christ or white people! I have used the api for about, well since before it existed actually. unsplash used to be a very indipendent and intelligent community of photographers, but actually it was a psyop trick to get people involved. just a few years later and all api-using apps and software built on unsplash, thousands for windows and mac, android etc, all stopped working and had to move over to the ""new system"", which then was the new new system and now its like a good 7 news in. still terrible. its only going to get worse. I have been given the same strange images (apples against a white background, indian men body painted orange, asian temples, basically anything that isnt from where I am from in the world) over and over from the api. Any devs here not notice that ur app is now a propaganda machine for just using a ""random"" image api? the images are not random, I stopped seeing beautiful images through the basic random endpoint years ago. Then it became you had to trick the endpoint with empty variables so that it would return an img. Then it became that you have to submit an application to be able to query the api xD lol. now the final blow in 2025 is that very slowy, and very secretively, has the new algorithm been changed to ensure the same absolute mind melting nothing over and over. White bmw wheel, cup of coffee, empty chair, two men holding hands, a car with a rainbow sticker. seriosuly this is so obvious but yet 99% of people reading this can only say schizo.

  
rip unsplash as being a good resource to devs to make great apps like 2013 - 2023 (the second they removed the random endpoint)

1jgirmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnfrench/comments/1jgirmz/pass√©_compos√©_vs_imparfait_here_are_my_tips/,Pass√© compos√© vs imparfait - Here are my tips!,"Hi everyone!  
I‚Äôm French, and I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of **French learners** at some point say something like:

>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get when to use pass√© compos√© or imparfait. It feels random.‚Äù

I really get why it feels that way. The rules you find in textbooks are often too vague (*‚Äúone is for completed actions, one is for descriptions‚Äù* okay, cool, but that doesn‚Äôt help when you‚Äôre telling a story).

So here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd **explain it if you were my friend**, over a coffee, not in a classroom:

**üëâ Pass√© compos√© = something happens**  
Boom. It happened. It started, it ended. You‚Äôre moving the story forward.  
*J‚Äôai mang√© une pizza.* ‚Üí The action exists, it happened, we‚Äôre done.

**üëâ Imparfait = background**  
It sets the scene, gives context, tells us how things *were* at that moment.  
*Il pleuvait.* = It was raining. It doesn‚Äôt move the story forward. It‚Äôs just there.

Now combine them, and you get something like:

>Il pleuvait quand je suis sorti.  
(It was raining when I went out.)

‚Üí The rain is the background (imparfait), me going out is the action that happens (pass√© compos√©).  
You can almost feel the **camera angle change**.

üé• **Another tip I give is to imagine a film scene.**  
Imparfait = what we see in the background  
Pass√© compos√© = what the camera zooms in on

>J‚Äô√©tais fatigu√©, alors j‚Äôai pris un caf√©.  
I was tired (background), so I had a coffee (action).

Of course there are tricky cases (vouloir, savoir, √™tre...) but if you think in terms of ‚Äúcamera movement‚Äù I think it could help a lot. Don't hesitate if you have any questions, maybe I or someone else could answer you!

By the way, I built a tool to help you **learn French** by listening to our **French podcast** with a **live transcription** that highlights each word as it's spoken, maybe you‚Äôll find it useful!

Lately, it could be that my taste changed, the machine is actually degrading, or my perception increases.

It *seems* I find EC155 to be inconsistent.

Now this is the reason why I'm upgrading.

Things to be noted:

* I like piccolo, cortado, and flat white
* I don't mind taking time I need since I will just be at home
* I don't mind complementing Flair with something like NanoFoamer

I have no first-hand experience in direct comparison of equipments.

I appreciate really good drinks from better machines in specialty shops, but EC155 served me well and I was really pragmatic with my expectations.

And so my new equipment options are:

* Flair Neo Flex
* Gemilai CRM3610

I have no idea how much difference an excellent espresso would make to a milk-based drink.

If milk ultimately hides the nuances of coffee, then it does not makes sense to me to spend more time and will just go for Gemilai regardless if it yields mediocre shot and mediocre steamed milk.

If the opposite is true, I can make peace with Flair and NanoFoamer.

Again, I have no preferences with workflow and time.

But if a longer workflow does not even yield an even better drink, I'll be fine with a good enough machine.

I would love to hear your thoughts especially from those who‚Äôve tried both setups.",1,1742568943.0,FlairEspresso,6,0.67,False

But I survived, and now I can face anything","Before you proceed, be warned that this contains my account of a very turbulent flight and how I succeeded. Severe turbulence was confirmed by the crew, so it's not my speculation. If you are sensitive or have severe anxiety, stop here. 

As an intro, I fly yearly back and forth from Europe to South America, which is a 12 hour flight. Personally, I am an aviation geek and wanted to be a pilot, but my career choices brought me elsewhere. I was always cool with flying until a very bad flight over the Amazon forest, and that traumatized me to this day. Needless to say, my yearly 12 hour torture is my biggest challenge.

However, all my flights were eventless. I always pictured the most chaotic scenarios and disasters, only to have the best possible experiences.   
  
But this week, it finally happened. I could write pages and pages about it, but in short the whole flight was turbulent. Seat belt sign on for most of the flight, a very shaky dinner and some chops in the middle of the Atlantic (which made me sweat and remember of a certain French carrier often). 

I kept my ritual to protect me:

1. Cockpit view on the screen, ensuring airspeed and altitude are correct;2. Window opened, wing and engine are still there, flaps working; 3. Repeat mentally that turbulence doesn't bring planes down; 4. picture the pilots joking and chatting in the cockpit and the AP engaged

  
And it was fine. Until the last hour. We were eating breakfast and suddenly we hit CAT. No storms, no rain, nothing visible. The most beautiful picture out of the window, but then suddenly the plane was rocking from side to side, up and down. My seat neighbor dropped his coffee, and my bread roll went flying to the back rows. Flight attended fell down, thankfully someone held the cart for her. She rushed to her seat. It was hardcore, it felt like I was running on a speedboat or off-roading with an ATV, except it was fast -- really fast. 

But then, shockingly, my reaction was the best possible and I appeared to be the calmest man in the room. I have no clue why, maybe the adrenaline rush was too much, maybe I was already tired from 11 hours of prior turbulence and thought ""not this s\*\*\*\* again"". I just told the person next to me that it's alright, no coffee spill on my side. ""Yeah, it's heavy but the plane can take it. Look at my screen, we're still keeping the same speed and only dropped a couple of feet, that's nothing to worry about"".  

And that's it, honestly. We did land safely and no one was hurt. I took my time to talk with the FA and she confirmed it was severe turbulence. The pilots mapped all the other spots and called them on the intercom to prepare the cabin, but this last stretch was a surprise. She said she haven't been into a flight like this in ages, and this was probably the worst she faced.

So yeah, I survived the worst. I didn't panic at the moment, didn't get hurt and even reassured people around me. I have no explanation to this, it just happened. And honestly? It is bothersome, but it didn't affect anything on the flight. We even arrived 10 minutes early. 

There's nothing to worry about. Just make sure you fly a respectable airline running good equipment and you'll be fine. Hope this helps you, and if your flight gets bad, just remember I've been to probably a much worse time than you and I'm here to tell the story, just like the other passengers and crew.

When I was in college, I probably went to a few too many parties and did too many all nighters studying for exams. I took tums like gum balls and drunk a lot of coffee.

I was a walking poster for heartburn all the time...

Finally on a call home to my mother who was a retired R.N. said "" you better get an endoscopy done to make sure I didn't have Barrett's esophagus.

Well long story short I was diagnosed with Barrett's. 

After some soul searching, I realized that it was probably my fault with all the partying and way to much coffee, so I decided to figure out how to heal it. 

I was studying nutrition at the University of Florida so I was determined to find out a cure.

Yesterday, two beautiful women sat next to me at my local coffee shop. I had never dared to try to speak to a pair of women before. I thought I heard them speaking French, so after gathering my resolve, in a lull in their conversation, I asked them if they were French. 

They turned out to be Turkish, speaking Turkish, which was really interesting as I had never met Turks before, and one of my favorite bands is partially Turkish (Altƒ±n G√ºn). So I told them about that, and we ended up talking for an hour straight.

The highlight of the conversation for me is that one of them said that this was like a movie, because I also mentioned Barƒ±≈ü Man√ßo, a very famous public figure in Turkey, whom Altƒ±n G√ºn has covered, and she couldn't believe that she was talking to a local in Puerto Rico about Barƒ±≈ü Man√ßo, she said she was expecting the cameras to show up or something.

I taught them some stuff about the history of Puerto Rico when they asked. They did have to ask, because for a good while the conversation was me asking questions and they eventually shifted it back to me (I know in conversation I prefer to be more of a listener, which I think can be a bit of an issue).

When it got late, I asked them to hang out later that night, but they told me they actually hadn't seen each other for 7 years (they had gotten to Puerto Rico yesterday): clearly this was more of a private trip, so I said my goodbyes.

Then I headed out to the bars by myself at night got shot down once and got two conversations going, but which fizzled quickly, one because I made a blunder that I had made before for the second time, hopefully this time the lesson sinks in.

P. S. The blunder is bringing up other women when you're talking to a girl with romantic intentions. I started talking to this girl who was alone at a local alternative bar. I opened with something like ""Hey, you're cute, I wanna talk to you"". After some small talk from her, she asked me how my day had went, and I brought up the Turkish girls, which had honestly been the highlight of my day. Then she made up that she got a phone call and left. I made the same mistake once with a girl in another bar (I mentioned that as I've lost interest in computer programming, women have become more interesting, and she immediately said goodbye). I think normal dudes never make this particular mistake, I have strong suspicions I have some autism going on.

P. P. S. Altƒ±n G√ºn seriously rocks, they do Turkish psychedelic rock. The Turkish girls taught me their name means Golden Day, which is an amazing name for a band. This band gave me my #3 favorite song of all time:

So I know what triggered it (stress, moving, feeling overwhelmed, starting a new job soon etc) 

My experience is that I get super confused like getting lost in my own house, going to make coffee and then just freezing in the kitchen. I can't have a conversation with anyone as every 30 seconds I forget what we were talking about and I can't get any words out. My brain just shuts down completely and it is terrifying to forget where I am or what I am doing every few seconds. And to not be able to respond to questions from people trying to help.

I also hallucinate, seeing things move that aren't moving and am just in a fog. My vision also goes blurry. It takes several hours for me to snap out of it.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong, Peter.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou keep saying that, but you can never tell me what it is,‚Äù he replies, exasperated. ‚ÄúWhat *exactly* is the problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt *know,* I say yet again. ‚ÄúSomething just feels‚Ä¶ off.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does *off* mean? Are you feeling ill? Are you seeing something? Hearing something?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt put it into words,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI just know something‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù

He sighs. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt believe you. But I don‚Äôt know what you want me to do with that. Do you want me to call the police? Put extra locks on the doors? Walk you to your car every morning? Help me out, here, Tessa. What are you looking for from me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt KNOW!‚Äù I scream, tears of frustration coming to my eyes. This has been going on for months now - doors open I thought I‚Äôd locked, small things not where I thought I‚Äôd left them. Nothing concrete, but an undeniable feeling that something is wrong. 

Peter puts his arms around me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, Tessa. We‚Äôll figure this out.‚Äù

I hope he‚Äôs right. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can take it. 

The next day I get up and go to work as normal. Work has become my refuge - my oasis of the ordinary. Weird things don‚Äôt happen here. I sit at my desk, joining conference calls and sending and replying to emails as usual. Just another day. And as usual, around mid-afternoon I need some caffeine to get me through the rest of the day. I go to the break room to grab some coffee. When I get back, my chair has been disturbed and one word appears on my computer monitor:

*DANGER*

I look around but don‚Äôt see anyone. I ask my coworkers; no one has seen anyone approach my desk. 

I have to get out of here. 

I run to my car and drive home, speeding inside and locking the door. When Peter gets home, I fall into his arms, crying. 

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù he asks. 

I tell him everything, barely managing to get the words out between sobs. 

‚ÄúCould it just be someone at work screwing with you? Someone who doesn‚Äôt like you?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just work!‚Äù I reply in frustration. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs here, too! I‚Äôm freaking out!‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, ok,‚Äù he concedes. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. We‚Äôll handle this.‚Äù

From then on, we sleep with a gun next to the bed. 

Three nights later, I awake to a noise and an odd feeling. I get up, feeling cold without the covers around me, and reach toward Peter. 

‚ÄúPeter. Peter. Peter!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he asks, blinking with bleary eyes. 

‚ÄúI heard something downstairs. I think someone‚Äôs here!‚Äù

Immediately alert, he grabs the gun and heads for the stairs. I follow. 

We get downstairs, looking around, but no one is there. We check the kitchen, the pantry, the guest room, the bathroom - nothing. Peter looks at me. 

‚ÄúWell, it looks like there‚Äôs nothi‚Äî‚Äú

Suddenly I feel a cold draft come over me. Terrified, I brace myself, but nothing happens. Then I look beside me. 

Peter was floating three feet off the ground, grasping his neck, trying to speak but unable to make a sound. I watched him, not knowing what to do, until I hear a loud *SNAP* and he drops to the ground. 

It killed him. 

Terrified, I start to run upstairs when something stops me. A force. I start screaming and trying to fight, but my arms go right through it. It pushes me relentlessly down toward the basement - it doesn‚Äôt hurt me, but I can‚Äôt resist. Once there, a book opens. It shows a series of women - all resembling me, all married to Peter. And then more pictures of their corpses. Finally, on the last page, a wedding photo of me smiling joyously at my husband. 

For the first time, I see the way he was looking at me, having been so happy before that I missed it. Not like a husband marrying the woman he loved. 

Like a predator that had finally caught its prey. 

*I would have been next.*

As I stare at the book, frozen by this realization, the cold disappears and the area around me returns to normal. Eventually, when the shock begins to wear off and I can move again, I call the police and report a break-in and Peter‚Äôs murder; when they find the photo album and other evidence, including momentos he kept, there aren't many questions. One of them tells me that I‚Äôm lucky to be alive. 

Yeah. Lucky. 

Time passes, and life goes on. I lean on my family and friends, and slowly my life starts to get back to normal. Occasionally I‚Äôll feel a cold draft in an otherwise warm room or see something not where I left it. 

But I‚Äôm no longer afraid. Why would I be? I know I have a guardian angel looking out for me.

Transport to/from: Uber and Taxis are not recommended. Private transfer is a good option but can be expensive for solo travellers. I decided to book private transfer through trip.com to PM and return by public transport but if you want to use the public transport from the airport these are the steps: 

- ADO bus from the airport to Cancun downtown. About $125 pesos, 30 min. Can buy online or at the airport.

- Outside ADO station in Cancun grab a collectivo going to Puerto Morelos (or one going to Playa del Carmen that will stop at PM). Get off at the bridge / el puente. $50, 40 min. 

- If going to the beach area, cross the road and   on the corner (on Calle Jose Maria Morelos) there's a taxi rank. This is also where collectivos stop towards the beach. They stop in multiple places with the main stop being by the church. $10, 10 min. 

With wait time between buses this takes about 2 hrs, but can be more with traffic (or less if you're lucky). I don't recommend it with a lot of luggage but a small suitcase was fine.

Food: So many options, in both parts. In the downtown I ate at Chilam Balam. $110 plato del dia (2 courses + sides + a drink) was great value. And tasted great. 
On the beach side I recommend street food, especially the lady selling tacos and tortas from a black stand by Oxxo Timon. 

Activities: I did snorkeling. You can either snorkel by the shore or get a boat tour to the reef.
Do walk by the church in the early evening as often they have performances with live band and traditional dancing.
The museum is currently closed unfortunately. 

Supermarkets: There's a big, beautiful Chedraui. Also many corner shops that also sell cheap coffee and hot snacks. 

Can't think of anything else. Hope this helps. ",1,1742567218.0,u_Kamila95,0,1.0,False

## Understanding the Key Ingredients for a Stellar Nespresso Martini

A great Nespresso Martini starts with‚Äç great ingredients. Let's break ‚Äçdown the essentials:

*   **espresso (nespresso Pods):** ‚ÄåThe heart and soul of the drink. ‚ÄçChoosing the right ‚Å¢Nespresso pod is crucial. ‚Å§We'll delve into specific recommendations below.
* ‚Å£  **Vodka:** Opt for a high-quality vodka.‚Äå The flavor profile of the vodka will‚Å¢ influence the final‚Äã taste of your ‚Äåmartini.
*   **Coffee Liqueur:** Kahl√∫a is the classic choice, but exploring other options like Tia‚Äå Maria or Mr. ‚ÄçBlack Cold Brew coffee Liqueur can add‚Äå unique twists.
* ‚Å£  ‚Å¢**Simple Syrup:** Provides a touch of sweetness to balance the bitterness of the espresso and the alcohol. ‚Å§You can easily make your own‚Äã simple syrup by dissolving‚Äå equal parts sugar and water over ‚Å£heat.
*   **Garnish:** Coffee beans are ‚Å£the traditional garnish, but‚Äå you can also experiment with chocolate shavings ‚Å¢or a dusting of cocoa powder.

## Choosing the Right Nespresso‚Å£ Machine: OriginalLine vs. VertuoLine for Your Nespresso Martini

Nespresso offers‚Äå two distinct ‚Å§lines of machines: originalline and VertuoLine. Each has its ‚Å£own strengths and weaknesses‚Äç when it comes to making Espresso Martinis.

### Nespresso OriginalLine: the Classic Choice

The OriginalLine machines use a ‚Å§high-pressure system to brew espresso. They are known for‚Å¢ their compact size, simple ‚Å§operation, and wide ‚Å§variety of compatible pods, including many third-party Nespresso compatible pods for martini creation.

**Pros:**

*  ‚Äå **Wide Pod Selection:** Extensive range of OriginalLine Nespresso pod recommendations martini,‚Äå including options‚Äç specifically designed for espresso.
*   **Smaller Footprint:**‚Å§ Ideal for kitchens with limited‚Å£ counter space.
*   **More Affordable Machines:** Typically less expensive than VertuoLine‚Äå machines.
*   **Perfect‚Å£ for Espresso‚Å£ Purists:** Delivers a classic espresso ‚Å¢experience.
    * ‚Å£  **Customizable Options:** Provides you with high level of control over the drink‚Äôs temperature and ‚Äãstrength.**Cons:**

*  ‚Å¢ **Limited Brew Sizes:** Primarily focuses‚Äã on espresso and lungo sizes, lacking larger‚Å¢ coffee options.
*‚Äå ‚Äå  **Fewer ""coffee Forward"" Options**: The Vertuo line offers larger, bolder coffee sizes that some might ‚Äãfind suitable as a cocktail component.

**Best‚Äç OriginalLine Machines for Nespresso Martinis:**

*   **Nespresso Essenza Mini:** Ultra-compact and‚Äç affordable, perfect for small spaces.
*‚Å§   ‚Å£**Nespresso CitiZ:** A stylish and versatile‚Å§ option with a retro design.
*‚Å§   ‚Å¢**Nespresso Pixie:** Compact and durable, with a fast heat-up time.

### Nespresso VertuoLine: ‚Å§The Versatile Innovator

VertuoLine machines use Centrifusion technology, which spins the‚Å£ pod at‚Äã high speeds to extract coffee. This method produces‚Å§ a crema-rich brew ‚Äçand allows for a wider range of cup sizes, ‚Äãfrom espresso to larger‚Äå mugs.

**Pros:**

*   **Variety of Brew Sizes:**‚Å§ Offers espresso, double espresso, gran‚Äã lungo, mug,‚Å§ and carafe‚Äå sizes, giving you flexibility in your‚Äã cocktail experimentation.*   **Innovative Technology:** ‚Å£Centrifusion technology ‚Å¢creates a consistent and flavorful brew.
*‚Å§   **One-Touch Brewing:** Simple and convenient operation.

**Cons:**

*   **Vertuo‚Å¢ Pod Specificity:** ‚Å§Onyl compatible with Nespresso Vertuo pods, limiting your options.
*   **Larger Machine‚Å§ Size:** Takes up more ‚Å§counter space than OriginalLine machines.*   **Generally More Expensive:**‚Å§ VertuoLine machines tend to be pricier than OriginalLine models.

**Best VertuoLine Machines for ‚ÄãNespresso‚Äã martinis:**

*   **Nespresso Vertuo Next:** Compact and stylish,‚Äã with automatic pod ‚Äãrecognition.
*   **Nespresso‚Å£ Vertuo Plus:** Offers a motorized head and adjustable water tank for added convenience.
* ‚Å£  **Nespresso vertuo Pop:** Most affordable of the Vertuo line. Its ‚Å¢small and comes in a variety of colors.

### which ‚Å£Nespresso Machine is‚Äå Right for You?

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm in a job where I'm able to save a bit for emergency (ex. enough for first, last, and deposit if I have to move within the US suddenly.) but I don't have any pre-reqs for various international visas. Most of the countries that have easy accessible immigration are also extremely anti trans and the LGBTQ friendly countries (As far as I know) aren't considering the U.S. bad enough at the moment for proper asylum. 

Long story short: I have fatty liver disease (Shocking Diagnosis for an American, I know.) and am going to various ultrasounds, healthcare foolishness, which as an American is expensive. Do I bother with treatment or do I save up for extra savings? Do I bother working towards curing myself when I most likely won't have the resources to get out in time anyway. why make myself healthy so I take longer to die in a camp? seems like a stupid plan. Not to mention all the stress is making my sweet tooth a 100% worst. 

  
I have no family or really any reason not to just eat myself into liver failure, so yeah, how do I stay motivated to even bother getting better? Is it even worth it at this point?

1jghtyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jghtyk/is_it_true_that_when_a_man_truly_love_one_woman/,"is it true that when a man truly love one woman, he'll always love only her?","I F(26), and BF M(28) We've been together for a year now. He has a dark and wild past, to say the least. His first love was when he was 16, and they were together from 2013 to 2017. She left him for someone else, and after that, he spiraled‚Äîclubbing, sleeping around, and jumping from one relationship to another. Since 2018, he has had six relationships, none lasting very long. Some ended due to cheating, others simply fell apart. His last relationship before me lasted almost a year, but again, his girlfriend cheated.

He has bipolar disorder, and there are times when he feels unworthy of love. After every breakup, he would cope through partying and casual encounters. But at the end of 2023, he decided to change, and in 2024, he met me.

Our relationship hasn't been smooth. The first month of living together was full of drama, mostly because he wasn‚Äôt completely honest with me. I found out things by checking his old chats. In 2022, he told some friends that he still missed his first love. And just a month before meeting me in 2024, he mentioned seeing her randomly and described her as ""the one I had the strongest feelings for.""

This makes me wonder: can a man ever truly move on from his first love? He reassures me that he's fully committed to me now, but after seeing those messages, I can't help but overthink. The internet is full of claims that men never really move on from their first love, and it haunts me.

He tells me I‚Äôm different, that I love him in a way he's never experienced before. But sometimes, I question if what I do is enough. I don‚Äôt want his past to haunt him‚Äîor me. Once, I asked him why he still seeks serious relationships when he could just enjoy casual flings. He got emotional and said, ""Do you know why? Because my first love cheated on me after six years together. That‚Äôs why I am like this."" But in reality, it was four years, not six. He even admitted this to a friend in a chat.

This only adds to my paranoia. Will I ever be enough for him? Will the love I give heal him? Since we started living together, I‚Äôve done everything I can to express my love in all five love languages‚Äîmassaging him when he‚Äôs tired, cooking for him, feeding him while he plays games, making coffee before he goes to work at 5 AM.

Yet, deep down, I fear that no matter how much I do, I might never replace his first love.

He once sent me a song. The lyrics start with a story just like his‚Äîhigh school sweethearts, thinking she was ""the one,"" only for her to leave him for someone else. But in the last verse, at 23, he meets another woman who gives him the love he never had before. He told me, ""See? It starts sad but ends well. Just change 23 to 27, because that‚Äôs when I met you.""

I want to believe him. But do you think he's truly moved on? Does he really love me as much as he says he does?",1,1742566554.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False
1jghtvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lexus/comments/1jghtvg/blind_spot_detector_issues/,Blind Spot Detector Issues,"Hello, 
I‚Äôm hoping to get some help with my coworker‚Äôs Lexus NX 350AWD. She‚Äôs an older lady who doesn‚Äôt really understand how Reddit works. 

This past January, she took her car in for service. She‚Äôs noticed since then that her blind spot detector will not work at night. She‚Äôs taken it in to be serviced again but they always say there isn‚Äôt a problem. The blind spot detector will randomly stop working, only at night, and she‚Äôll have to go into driver assist to turn it off & on to make it start working. 

She‚Äôs been trying to contact her dealership to try and get answers but they‚Äôre mostly ignoring her by this point. She‚Äôs told us that when she took it in to be serviced, the guy working on the car spilled his coffee in her car and didn‚Äôt even clean it up. 

Can anyone recommend how to fix this issue where she won‚Äôt have to keep going into driver assist or possibly another dealership or mechanic who can help her?",1,1742566548.0,Lexus,2,1.0,False

Other forms of coffee are considered better obviously, but for those who do don‚Äôt mind single serve, how can you stomach Keurig coffee?

I‚Äôve drank coffee from three different Keurigs, new and old, in the past year and all of them have had the exact same, burnt and undrinkable, flavor. It seems like something to do with the Keurig brand because I have an old, 6 year old Cuisinart single cup maker that I rarely, if ever, descale and it makes coffee that is delicious and doesn‚Äôt taste like burnt ass. I even brought my coffee pods from home that taste really good from my machine but the Keurigs I tried it in converted it into swill.

I‚Äôve looked up opinions online about it and everyone in the comments seems to think it‚Äôs mold in the machine, it‚Äôs not descaled, or claim that the op is probably just recovering from corvid and can‚Äôt taste properly. Those are BS excuses. I think it legit burns the coffee and makes it taste awful and shouldn‚Äôt be considered even closest to the ‚Äúbest‚Äù single serve machine in the game. And everyone in my life drinks their Keurig coffee without batting an eye or realizing something like my old ass Cuisinart machine can taste way better.",0,1742566525.0,The10thDentist,20,0.34,False

When Starbucks came out with the Blonde Roasts I was really impressed, and Veranda Blend became a favorite.  I lately noticed that Nespresso has licensed a Vertuo pod version of the Veranda Blend.  I bought some and made it at the same time as an Aeropress using beans bought from the grocer (so, not very fresh), at a 15:1 ratio of water to coffee by weight.  The two cups tasted almost identical.  It .was hard, apart from the foam, to distinguish them",1,1742566465.0,coffeediscussion,0,1.0,False
