## Key Features Analysis

The best Panda Milk Teas in 2025 are characterized by a few key features that set them apart from the rest. These include the quality of the tea base, the texture and flavor of the panda pearls, the sweetness level, and the overall balance of the drink.

**High-Quality Tea Base:** The foundation of any great milk tea is the tea itself. The best Panda Milk Teas use premium black tea leaves, often sourced directly from reputable tea gardens. These teas are carefully brewed to extract their rich, aromatic flavor without bitterness. The specific type of black tea can vary, with some brands using Assam for its bold flavor, while others opt for Ceylon for its more subtle notes.

**Perfectly Chewy Panda Pearls:** The signature element of Panda Milk Tea is, of course, the panda pearls. These are typically made from tapioca starch and colored black and white to resemble panda eyes. The ideal panda pearl should be perfectly chewy, with a slightly sweet flavor that complements the tea base. The best pearls are also consistent in size and shape, ensuring a uniform texture throughout the drink. Some brands even offer variations with different fillings or flavors within the pearls.

**Customizable Sweetness Level:** Sweetness is a crucial factor in any milk tea, and the best Panda Milk Teas allow customers to customize the sweetness level to their preference. This ensures that everyone can enjoy the drink, whether they prefer it lightly sweetened or extra sweet. Options typically range from 0% (unsweetened) to 100% (full sweetness), with increments in between. This level of personalization is essential for catering to a wide range of tastes.

**Balanced Flavor Profile:** A truly exceptional Panda Milk Tea achieves a perfect balance between the tea base, the milk (or creamer), and the panda pearls. The flavors should harmonize, with no single element overpowering the others. The tea should be strong enough to stand up to the sweetness of the pearls, while the milk should add a creamy texture and subtle flavor. The overall result should be a refreshing and satisfying drink that is both flavorful and visually appealing.

Key features of the best Panda Milk Teas include:

*   Premium tea base
*   Chewy and flavorful panda pearls
*   Customizable sweetness levels
*   Balanced flavor profile
*   High-quality milk or creamer
*   Visually appealing presentation

## Core Benefits

Panda Milk Tea offers several distinct benefits that contribute to its popularity. These include its unique visual appeal, its satisfying texture, its customizable sweetness, and its overall refreshing quality.

**Aesthetically Pleasing Presentation:** The distinctive black and white panda pearls make Panda Milk Tea a visually appealing drink. This makes it particularly popular on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, where users often share photos and videos of their aesthetically pleasing drinks. The visual appeal can enhance the overall enjoyment of the drink, making it a more memorable and shareable experience.

**Satisfying Chewy Texture:** The chewy texture of the panda pearls adds a unique dimension to the drinking experience. This texture provides a satisfying contrast to the smooth liquid of the milk tea, making it more engaging and enjoyable. The act of chewing the pearls also releases additional flavor, further enhancing the overall taste.

**Personalized Sweetness Levels:** The ability to customize the sweetness level is a major benefit of Panda Milk Tea. This allows individuals to tailor the drink to their specific preferences, ensuring that it is neither too sweet nor too bland. This level of personalization is particularly important for those who are sensitive to sugar or who prefer a more subtle flavor.

**Refreshing and Invigorating:** Panda Milk Tea is a refreshing and invigorating drink that is perfect for any time of day. The combination of tea, milk, and pearls provides a boost of energy and hydration, making it a great alternative to coffee or soda. The cold temperature of the drink also adds to its refreshing quality, making it particularly enjoyable on a hot day.

**A Moment of Joy:** Beyond the practical benefits, Panda Milk Tea can simply bring a moment of joy. The combination of flavors, textures, and visual appeal can create a delightful sensory experience that brightens one's day.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about Panda Milk Tea:

**What exactly are panda pearls made of?**
  Panda pearls are typically made from tapioca starch, water, and sugar. The black color is usually achieved using food-grade charcoal powder or black food coloring. The white color is simply the natural color of the tapioca starch. Some variations may also include other ingredients, such as flavorings or fillings.

**Is Panda Milk Tea suitable for vegans?**
  Whether Panda Milk Tea is suitable for vegans depends on the ingredients used. The tea base itself is typically vegan, but the milk or creamer used may not be. Many milk tea shops now offer plant-based milk alternatives, such as soy milk, almond milk, or oat milk, which would make the drink vegan-friendly. It's also important to check the ingredients of the panda pearls, as some may contain gelatin or other animal-derived ingredients. Always inquire about the ingredients before ordering if you are vegan.

**How many calories are in a typical cup of Panda Milk Tea?**
  The calorie content of Panda Milk Tea can vary depending on the size of the cup, the sweetness level, and the type of milk or creamer used. A typical 16-ounce cup of Panda Milk Tea with regular milk and medium sweetness can contain anywhere from 250 to 400 calories. Using a plant-based milk alternative and reducing the sweetness can help to lower the calorie count.

**Can I make Panda Milk Tea at home?**
  Yes, you can definitely make Panda Milk Tea at home! You will need tapioca pearls (which can be found at most Asian grocery stores), black food coloring or charcoal powder (optional, for the black pearls), your preferred black tea, milk or creamer, and sweetener. There are many recipes available online that provide step-by-step instructions for making Panda Milk Tea at home.

## Competitor Comparison

Let's compare three popular Panda Milk Tea options:

### Product Comparison Overview

#### Happy Panda Tea
*   **Tea Base:** Uses premium Assam black tea, known for its bold and malty flavor.
*   **Panda Pearls:** Made fresh daily, with a consistent chewy texture and a subtle sweetness.
*   **Sweetness Customization:** Offers a wide range of sweetness levels, from 0% to 100%, in 10% increments.

#### Boba Bliss
*   **Tea Base:** Uses a blend of Ceylon and Assam black teas for a more balanced flavor profile.
*   **Panda Pearls:** Pre-made and stored in syrup, resulting in a slightly softer texture.
*   **Sweetness Customization:** Offers limited sweetness options: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%.

#### Tea Time Treats
*   **Tea Base:** Uses a generic black tea blend, resulting in a less distinct flavor.
*   **Panda Pearls:** Contains gelatin, giving it a distinct texture.
*   **Sweetness Customization:** Only offers 50% and 100% sweetness options.

### Key Differences Summary
Happy Panda Tea excels in the quality of its tea base and the freshness of its panda pearls, making it a premium option. Boba Bliss offers a more balanced tea flavor but its pre-made pearls are less chewy. Tea Time Treats is a more budget-friendly option, but the gelatin in the pearls and limited customization options may not appeal to all.

Now I finished watching season 2 and it was a lot less! 
To be included in my count, the coffee had to be poured and consumed. There was a lot of ""I  need coffee"" or mugs in frame that did not get counted, so by no means I claim this is accurate. 

Anyways, in season 2 Lorelai had 31 cups of coffee! Which is somewhat surprising to me.

However since the initial notification they have been avoiding me as much as possible other than generic big company responses and every time I ask for a phone call for more information as to what happened they don’t reply. 

Do they have a responsibility to at least talk to me about what happened? 


Long Story: last Sunday afternoon I purchased via buy now a super expensive coffee machine for $4900 from an authenticated members account (since 2009, 107 positive reviews) I had wanted a machine like this for probably 10 years and while doing a kitchen renovation managed to make room in the budget by purchasing other appliances second hand etc. please don’t come at me for spending 5k on a coffee machine in the first place 🫣

The auction didn’t give off any red flags to me. It had multiple questions all answered legit and he even turned down a slightly low offer in the comments. One red flag looking back was they were offering free shipping but I just figured expensive machine or maybe they worked for a logistics/courier company and could do it cheap. They communicated great with me and after I transferred the money and provided a screenshot they booked a courier and sent me tracking info that night. 

The next morning around 9am I get an email from trademe saying do not complete trade it is an illegitimate account and they are deleting it. I straight away call my bank and lodge police report etc. how shit the bank was at responding to this situation is a whole other story!

I respond to the Trademe email saying how did they find out about the scammer but no response, I also send another email that day with no response. I also notice in the afternoon that the deleted account was back online again?? I just had so many questions. 

The next day I get on a Trademe live chat and ask for someone to call me, they reply and say someone will aim to in the next business day. Two days later no response so I start hassling them over and over until I get what feels like an automated response saying either sort it out with the seller or go to police.  I respond and say please call me and once again I’m ghosted.

Obviously it’s gross and rude but is their response by basically telling me to fuck off and then ignoring me every time I ask for a phone call legal or do companies have an obligation to communicate with a customer in a situation like this?

I just want to know how it all happened and why no alarm bells went off in their system when somebody accessed an account from a new location, changed address, email address passwords etc before listing an item. surely these are all red flags for unauthorized access/malicious activity and trademe as a company would do something when they see this happening.

(I didn't post the previous one here.  I probably should have. )  I would very much appreciate any advice on how to improve this!  Thank you in advance.



Dear Agent,



Tilly Saltwater is not exactly thrilled about visiting Granny’s haunted B&B. The only guests are fussy old ghosts from the cemetery next door, and the creepy treehouse keeps her up at night with its shrieking. Granny’s small Maine town takes Spookyfest extremely seriously, and it’s nowhere near as fun as Tilly remembers. Being on the costume committee has Granny stressed out, the pumpkin patch still looms large in Tilly’s nightmares, and when a frazzled Granny puts her in charge of decorating for this year’s Best-Dressed Business Contest, Tilly swears she’s up to the challenge, but secretly, she’s not so sure.



What chance does an almost-twelve-year-old have against Spookyfest royalty like Granny’s nemesis at the coffee shop, who has won first prize for ten years in a row? Tilly might be creative and armed with buckets of glitter glue, but for a task like this, regular craft supplies won’t cut it. Fortunately, the old book she unearths in Granny’s attic promises a magical solution.



*Catch A Witch In Two Weeks Or Less* guarantees that, by following its series of foolproof steps, Tilly will snag the witch of her dreams in just two shakes of a broomstick, ensuring that she’ll get a YES when she “pops the big question” and ignites the magic between them! Tilly has never even seen a real witch, but with less than two weeks until Halloween, she’s desperate. If she can manage to use this book to meet one and ask for the witch’s help with the decorations, that golden pumpkin award will be hers and Granny’s for sure.



Unbeknownst to Tilly, the book in the attic is an old-fashioned dating manual from Granny’s youth. When Tilly and some newfound friends use an all-too-real magic wand to follow the book’s instructions to the letter, all they brew up is trouble, culminating in a spell that goes sideways and brings every Halloween decoration in town to life! Now Tilly and her friends need to scramble to appease the living decorations before the Spookyfest parade, fight a bushel of bad apples, and help the treehouse ghost find what she’s been missing. And when the Head Witch herself finally answers Tilly’s summons, Tilly finds the magic she’s been looking for all along in herself, her Granny…and Granny’s girlfriend from the coffee shop, too.



HALLOWEEN AT HAUNTED HOLLOW is a cozy and spooky middle grade fantasy complete at 73,000 words. It’s *Gravity Falls* meets *Gilmore Girls* with a pinch of Oz dust thrown in, as well as a love letter to the Betty Ren Wright books that gave me nightmares as a kid. Readers who were thrilled to see the queer grandma revelation and the prickly found family in Rebecca Mix’s *The Mossheart’s Promise* and loved the cozy inclusiveness of K. O’Neill’s *Tea Dragon Society* might very well like Tilly Saltwater and her world.



My first novel, \[TITLE\] was published by \[SMALL PRESS\], a now-defunct independent press, in 2007. It won \[THIS INDIE AWARD FIRST PLACE\] and was shortlisted for \[THIS OTHER AWARD\].

It follows a similarish plot, but with new and changed characters, leads directly into the new universe, fixes the CGI and vfx issues, recasts Barry Allen to George McKay, and serves as a love letter to DC cinema.

Side note: For those who are going to get mad at ""cameo/nostalgia bait!!"", you can just ignore the ending multiverse sequence. The film also uses ZSJL instead of the theatrical cut as its established cannon.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Opening in Central City, Barry goes to his favorite coffee shop, ordering there largest sandwich and a coffee. he's stressed by the slow pace of the place and is suddenly interrupted by an incoming call to Alfred who summons him to help the League in Gotham. Flash, annoyingly speeds off. As he arrives he watches Gotham General Hospital begin to collapse due too structural damage caused by Deathstroke and a number of other mercenaries, whom had raided a bioweapons lab under the building, working to acquire tools for his and Luthor's ""Legion of Doom"". Barry is soon met by his friend the multiversal speedster ""Zoom"", together they save a number of people, mainly babies from the children's wing, in a speed sequence set to the tune of ""Sweet Child O' Mine"". Barry finshes his save, after which the nurse simply passes out in his arms, Zoom tells Flash to meet him later, and Flash catches up with Batman, who is engaged in a high speed chase with Deathstroke, eventually, he is forced to stop as Wonder Woman blocks the road ahead, he looks up only to see Superman holding their escape helicopter. With no other choice, Slade decides to shoot for plan B, jumping from the bridge, hoping to use an underwater propulsion device to make it to some place under the bay where he could be retrieved, however, just before he hits the water Aquaman grabs and throws him back up on to the bridge where he's placed under arrest. We get a scene where Barry exchanges banter with the rest of the League, particularly Aquaman, Barry remarks its odd that Superman is back, as he believed he was still in Kahndaq, to which Clark makes an aside about how he beat Black Adam fairly quickly.

After this, Barry returns to the coffee shop, grabbing his order, he runs out, scarfing it down on the way, as the barista yells something about how low a tip he left. Barry then rushes off to work, sitting through a briefing on a recent murder investigation before being scolded by his boss for always being so late. Barry leaves rather annoyed, but perks upon being greeted by his girlfriend, reporter Iris West, complaining about how she can't write the story on his fathers appeal due to a ""conflict of interest"". Later that night Barry talks with both his father, Henry, still in prison, and Bruce, a clear second father to him. Bruce gives Barry some advice, attempting to relate to the death of his mom, Barry can't accept it. He goes back to his home, part apartment, part base, part lab and finds Zoom, whom he has been working with a while now, relying on his experience and knowledge of the speed force. Zoom tells him of the loss of his sister, and how he travelled backwards in time through the speed force to fix it. A desperate Barry, against his father, Bruce, and Iris's judgement, decides to listen to Zoom, travelling backwards in time to prevent his mothers murder.

Having created a new timeline, Barry finds himself not just in an alternate reality, but as he soon learns, the past. He attempts to adjust to this new universe, going through the motions of life and trying to make sense of what's going on, as his powers seem to have disappeared. However, soon after arriving General Zods message goes out to the world, demanding they hand over Kal-El, Barry understandably freaks out. Googling individuals heroes, Barry finds Victor still playing football, no references to Clark Kent, and has a rather awkward phone call with Thomas Curry. Though, he manages to find a handful of grainy photographs of Diana Prince, and Wonder Woman, alongside a large number of references to a Batman in Gotham City and a Bruce Wayne. Travelling to Wayne manor first, seeing it as his only real chance at help, he encounters an older, apathic Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton), arguing with an older Wonder Woman (Lynda Carter), attempting to force him out of retirement, Bruce however refuses having fallen into a state of depression. They are stunned by Barrys interuption, and attack him for a moment, Barry however calms them down and explains his situation, Bruce then proceeds to try and sort out the multiverse with the two of them.

Barry explains who Zod is, attempts to tell them about Superman, and insists that he needs his powers back, and must recreate the accident. Though worried for his safety, Wonder Woman agrees whole heartedly with him, Bruce still refuses. However he tells Barry he can stay the night, as Dianna refuses to leave until Bruce agrees to help them, or she must face Zod, even if it ends up as her alone. Cutting to night, Bruce is seen sleeping upside down, as he has done for years, though he is unable to actually fall asleep. He begins to walk outside, as he leaves the manor he is looked down on by paintings of his ancestors, looking down on his phone, he sees that ""Winston Drake (Robin)"" still hasn't be answering his messages. Outside the manor, he kneels and reflects in front of the graves of Martha and Thomas Wayne, Alfred Pennyworth, and Selena Wayne-Kyle. After a minute or two of emotional silence, he strikes a glare at Dianna Prince, whom he notices watching him from above in the building. In the morning he relents, agreeing to help the duo, recreating his accident, Barry regains his powers. In the Batcave, the trio can't find any record of Clarks capsule entering Earth, but they do find records of a similar one having crashed in Russia.

With the Invisible Jet broken, they take the Batplane, with the trio arriving the next day at a facility in Russia near the crash site. There, after a series of protracted fights, including against a merc in a mech suit, they find not Kal-El, but Kara-Zor El. They rescue her and bring her back to the Batcave, nursing her back to health, she still refuses to help them, due to her horrible experiences with humans so far. depression and PTSD, despite her being the only being with powers able to actually take on Zod and destroy the world engines. She has a heart to heart with Barry, and after reliving trauma Zod had inflicted on her family, agrees to help this odd new ""Justice League"", defeat Zod.

The team flies to confront Zod, learning that he murdered Kal-El, Kara becomes enraged, attempting to kill him, she does serious damage to Zods army, but ultimately the general grabs, and kills her. Bruce dies piloting the Batplane, attempting to take down the main Kryptonian ship. Wonder Woman is gravely injured in the ensuing fight, and is executed by Zod. Barry is horrified, he runs attempting to undo time, but each time he goes back, the rest of the League die all the same. Finally, during another attempt to save Wonder Woman, he feels a presence behind him. Turning around, while moving at Super Speed, he sees Zoom, now the Reverse Flash, he reveals himself as Eobard-Thawne, ranting about his hatred of Barry, he reveals that he is the one who killed his mother, that he has been playing him for weeks and now, he'll force Barry to watch his whole world dies around him. Then, suddenly, Wonder Woman, the only other person able to move at similar speeds, grabs Eobard, throwing the two out of slow motion, she breaks his legs, yelling for Barry to run, he does so, at speeds he never before imagined possible. Barry suddenly finds himself running through the events of the movie, then of Justice League. Before ultimately finding himself not running through the past but alternate realities.

He passes through a world where he finds Superman (George Reeves), Flash (Jay Garrick), Batman (Adam West), Nightwing (Burt Ward), fighting Starro, during which Jay glances over to him. Continuing his journey, finds himself on an Earth in which Batman (Thomas Wayne-Jeffery Dean Morgan), battles with an evil Aquaman and Wonder Woman. Travelling further, he passes by two other Flashes in the Speed Force (Grant Gustin and John Wesley Shipp) who shoot a smile and a wave at him. Next finding himself on a world where Kingdom Come Batman (Kevin Conroy) and Superman (Tim Daly) battle it out, finally after travelling through worlds where Superman (Nick Cage) fights a giant spider, The Justice League (A Christian Bale Batman variant, Brandon Rouths Superman as seen at the end of Crisis on Infinite Earths, Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern, and Adam Brodys Flash) fight Brianiac, and world showing Zack Synders Watchmen variants, onwhich Dr. Manhattan watches him with an odd interest, Barry finally finds himself back in time. Preventing his past actions, he sadly lets his mother die, yet he moves a can slightly out of the way at the same time.

Barry then exits the Speed Force. finding himself at the courthouse where his fathers trial will be held, at which, new video evidence, leads to his aquation. Leaving the Court House, he meets with Iris, who greets him with a kiss on the cheek, and her nephew Wally West, this seems completely normal to them. but Barry is shocked, not knowing who the kid is. Just then, Iris introduces Barry to a reporter friend of hers, Clark Kent (David Corenswet) of the Daily Planet, Clark asks him a question about the trial but Barry is stunned, muttering under his breath ""Superman?"", to which Clark replies he didn't catch that and proceeds to trip over himself.

In the post credits scene, we find Barry, still trying to adjust to this new world, attending the dedication of the brand new Flash museum with ""Kid Flash"" at his side, before being interrupted by the Rogues (Trickster, Heatwave, Captain Boomerang, Captain Cold and Mirror Master), The Flashes then spring into action as the movie comes to a close.",1,1752885950.0,fixingmovies,1,1.0,False

I am a college student and am dealing with some poor financial decisions that I made in the past due to a lack of financial literacy (they should really teach this stuff in school... 😭). I am about 30k in debt with a 17.8% IR and it takes a LOT of mental energy to keep up with feeding and housing myself on $1500 a month and then paying back monthly debt payments. But of course I am a 22 year old and want to be able to enjoy romance and the fun of being in college, so I got into a relationship as one does. About 3 months in, I found it very difficult to keep up with the gender role of the chivalrous guy who can take care of my boo thangs coffee and go on dates etc. PLUS she lives 30+ mins away which would cost a ton in gas. My s/o began to say that she felt I should be budgeting to prioritize our relationship more, but I tried to express that I was running a thin margin as it was already. Eventually, it seemed like too much pressure for me and I decided to end the relationship. My question is, how do I navigate relationship at all going forward? I have one more year of school and then I'll have to start paying back even more in tuition loans. It feels like my finances are going to hurt my chances of ever finding someone. Which sucks!

6’3, 190. Work out daily.
My cholesterol was always good and then in 2021 it skyrocketed. I thought it was from the Covid vaccines but alas. 

This past January my total cholesterol was 245. In April, after making some diet changes and taking a scoop of Metamucil daily it came down to 170!

Now cut to July and it’s back up to 203. I cannot understand why it went up again.

My only thoughts are i began a new job in april and I’ve been drinking a lot of coffee, and eating a chocolate chip muffin from our work cafe almost daily. At home I drink coffee with my plant based dairy free creamer but at work I use half and half.  I’ve also been eating a good amount of pasta and bread, and I stopped taking fish oil.

Could this all cause my total to go up 30 points back to 203?

I used to be a long-haul trucker. East coast to west, mostly. Nights never bothered me. Empty highways, desert stretches, the hum of the road — that was my church.

But I quit two years ago.

There’s something they don’t tell you about I-80 through Nevada.

There’s a third exit just past mile marker 729.

And if you take it…
you don’t come back the same.


---

It started like any other run. Pick-up in Jersey, drop in Sacramento. Uneventful until Utah. Then I hit a storm — weird one. Rain that sounded like teeth chattering on the windshield.

I pushed through. Around 2:40 a.m., I crossed into Nevada.

That’s when the GPS glitched.

The screen went black for a second, then flashed:

> “Rerouting… Rerouting… REVEALING.”



Then the voice said something strange:

> “Take the third exit.”



I remember thinking: What third exit? There’s only two in that stretch — one to the gas station near Silver Springs, the other to a dead mining town.

But then… I saw it.


---

An unlit ramp. No signs. No lights. Just a curve of road leading into blackness.

And yet... I took it.

Don’t ask why.


---

It felt like I was falling sideways.

My ears rang. The stars above blinked off like someone cut the sky’s power.

I drove maybe two minutes, maybe two hours. Couldn’t tell. There were shapes in the trees — if they were trees. Tall, thin things that leaned toward the road. Moving with no wind.

Then I saw the billboard.

Just one word painted in long, red strokes:

> “REMEMBER.”



That’s when I realized…

My headlights had been off the whole time.

And I could still see.


---

I made it to what looked like a rest stop.

But there were no cars. No vending machines. Just people — or something wearing people — standing around, twitching.

Their faces looked… borrowed.

Smiles too wide. Teeth too smooth. Skin that didn’t wrinkle when they moved.

One of them walked up to my cab, tapped the window, and whispered:

> “You’ve been here before.”



I floored it.


---

I don’t remember getting back on the main road.

But when I looked at the dash clock, it said 12:13 a.m.
Earlier than when I had seen the exit.

I pulled into a truck stop outside Reno and vomited in the lot.

The woman behind the counter looked at me and said:

> “Another one, huh? You took the third exit.”



I froze.

She handed me a cup of coffee and whispered, dead serious:

> “Don’t look in any mirrors tonight. It finds its way through reflections.”




---

I’ve quit trucking. I barely sleep. My reflection lags about half a second behind now. It watches me. Sometimes… it grins when I don’t.

I’ve covered every mirror in the house.
I keep all the lights on.
And I never, ever drive past mile marker 729 again.

Because that exit?
It’s still there.

Waiting.

And every once in a while, at 2:40 a.m., my GPS says:

I (31m) have a friend (27f) who I met at university. We meet up every now and then (cafes, restaurants, brunch, parks etc) and when we're out we genuinely look like a couple - it's cute af! Our friend group always say that we're a match – she's very smart, attractive and kind. Yet, I'm actually good with being friends: it's so nice spending time with the opposite sex, especially as we enjoy one another's company – we're talking constant belly laughs for hours!

Here's where it gets interesting. My friend is always in situationships with tall, lean, wealthy corporate finance types. When we meet, she tells me everything: all the details. She basically talks the whole time and I sit there listening and eating (like a good boy). She'd ask be about my relationship life, then cut me off within 2 mins to talk about her next situaitonship (she's quite dominant). I'm essentially her feminine bestie, it's very emasculating, especially as I usually go 6-12 months without having any sex at all.

I'm shorter (5'6""), not wealthy, and still live at home with parents; I know I do not measure up – not even close. She gets her sexual needs met with her situationships, and seemingly her softer emotional needs met with me – and honestly, I love this! Usually this would turn a guy off, but it has the opposite effect because I'm a beta cuck (and proud). 

She gets the attention, and wants all the coffees, meals and drinks paid for, and I do so without question. Knowing what she'll doing later that day with her crush just makes it even better for me. At the same time: my money is spent, and I'm alone gooning on reddit, wishing I was her crush's position.

Best thing is, I don't even know how this emerged, it sort of just... happened! What is this even called: findom, friendzoning, beta-orbiter? I'm unsure. Whatever it is, she is happy and me likewise! :)

Having lots of fun at the moment but also some frustration. There's a multitude of issues to work through but I have one particular question for the Bambino users here.

I'm using stock equipment for the time being with the single wall double shot basket + fresh roasted beans. The issue I'm having is that when I fully lock off my portafilter it skews slightly to the right of centre. The photo taken I've tried to centre the camera as much as possible.

Yesterday I had a pretty awesome pull but when I tried it again today with basically the same settings I had a few drops of espresso max. Like I said, there are a few things I can think of as points of difference but one of them was that I didn't max out the portafilter lock today. It was tight but not all the way.

I've looked online at videos from Breville and other YouTubers and their portafilter handles are almost always centre, I saw a couple left of centre but never right of centre. My questions are:

1. Is this normal?
2. Does anyone else's machine do this?
3. Is locking it to the maximum range going to affect my pull? 
4. (bonus question) If I do an under extraction of a few drops, what will running another shot with the same cake loaded into the machine do to the coffee/machine? I did that today because I was short of time and it just shot out mostly coffee minimal Crema. But does doing this have negative effects?

I'm just trying to approach every possibility without using all the beans in the kingdom.

Hi all,

For the last 16 years, I've done weird things in my sleep. It started suddenly when I was 12 years old and has persisted ever since. Sometimes the things that happen during sleep really bother me and cause a great deal of distress, other times they are mild and nothing more than a nuisance. I always thought I was just weird and never looked into it. That is, until I was pregnant with my daughter in 2022. I used to jump out of bed and run- this obviously became dangerous the more pregnant i got. Once i had my daughter, I used to pick her up out of her bedside bassinet and run with her asleep out of the room (very dangerous, I still cringe 3 years later). Shes 2.5 now, and last night she ended up in bed with me after a long night. I had an episode where I jumped out of bed, ran into the kitchen, ran back, grabbed her and picked her up, ran back out of the room with her, then i guess went back to bed and put her back in my bed. All half asleep but awake enough to remember. 

The symptoms of my sleep issues are:

-Extremely vivid hallucinations that occur about 10-30 minutes after falling asleep. Happen anywhere from multiple times a night to once or twice a week. Never during the day when im awake.

-Sleep paralysis during naps (really only occurs of i sleep on my back in a warm room during a nap- usually not at night)

-Confusional awakenings- I wake up not able to speak and cant remember who I am, who my husband is, or where I am. I just have a general sense of familiarity. Sometimes it can take awhile to snap out of it. 

-Wake up and run out of the room from a dead sleep (maybe from a hallucination that i dont remember)

-I am very fatigued all day every day, no matter if I sleep 5 hours or 9. I used to self medicate with a stupid amount of coffee every day and naps- I can not longer do this after the tachycardia diagnosis and a toddler. If I push through the urge to go to sleep thag starts around 1-2 pm (which is have to do everyday) I get severe brain fog.

-My IST is so much worse at night because of the frequent sitting up or jumping up out of a dead sleep. My heart rates can get up to 200 sometimes. This has only been the last 3 years since covid.

Pertinent testing:

-I saw a sleep neurologist who suspected narcolepsy. My MSLT was negative for early sleep onset or REM even though i slept for all 5 naps. My sleep latency during the nightime PSG was 6 minutes. On a prior PSG- my sleep latency was also 6 minutes and i had a REM onset of 50 minutes which she said was early. Once MSLT was negative my sleep neurologist told me she didn't know and told me to come back if anything changes.

-I saw a neurologist who did a 5 day ambulatory home EEG which was negative for seizures, but did capture quite a few of these episodes that the PSG/MSLT did not. 

-MRI head w/wo- normal 

If anyone can help me or give me advice, id be so grateful. I want another baby, but im so scared that I could hurt them on accident. I am scared for my current child. My husband has a job where he is gone 3 weeks a month and I am all alone most nights. Its also so hard to function through the fatigue now without coffee and not being able to nap since my toddler dropped her nap.",2,1752885053.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

the leading teeth whitening chewing gums of 2025 showcase innovative formulations and enhanced delivery systems to maximize their stain-removal and polishing capabilities.

**advanced Polishing Micro-Particles:**

Many top-rated whitening gums incorporate micro-particles engineered for gentle but effective stain removal. These particles, often composed of silica or other mild abrasives, work by physically scrubbing away surface stains caused by coffee, tea, wine, and other common culprits. The texture and size of these particles are carefully calibrated to minimize the risk of enamel abrasion while maximizing their polishing action.

**Hydrogen Peroxide infusion:**

Some teeth whitening chewing gums feature a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide, a well-known whitening agent. This ingredient helps to break down stain molecules on the tooth surface, leading to a gradual lightening of the enamel. The amount of hydrogen peroxide is typically controlled to ensure safety and prevent sensitivity, making it suitable for regular use.**Xylitol Enrichment:**

Xylitol, a natural sugar alcohol, is a common ingredient in many dental products, including teeth whitening chewing gum. It plays a crucial role in promoting oral health by inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth. This helps to reduce plaque formation and prevent cavities, contributing to a cleaner and healthier oral surroundings.

**Calcium Phosphate technology:**

Some advanced formulations utilize calcium phosphate technologies, such as amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), to remineralize enamel and strengthen teeth.

This also enhances the overall appearance and health of the teeth.

**Flavor Delivery System:**

A key aspect of any chewing gum is its flavor, and whitening gums are no exception. Manufacturers have invested in developing sophisticated flavor delivery systems that provide a long-lasting and enjoyable chewing experience. These systems often incorporate multiple layers of flavor, ensuring a refreshing and pleasant taste that encourages regular use.

The best ""We The People"" hats are distinguished by several key features that contribute to their overall quality, comfort, and durability.These include the materials used, the design and embroidery, the fit and adjustability, and the overall construction and finishing. Each of these factors plays a crucial role in ensuring that the hat not only looks good but also withstands regular wear and tear.

**material Quality:**

The Material Quality of a ""We The People"" hat is paramount, as it dictates both comfort and longevity. Premium hats typically employ durable fabrics like brushed cotton twill, canvas, or even performance-oriented synthetic blends. These materials not only provide a soft and comfortable feel against the skin but also offer resistance to fading, shrinking, and wear. Lower-quality hats ofen use cheaper materials that may feel rough, lack breathability, and degrade quickly with exposure to sunlight and washing. A high-quality material ensures the hat maintains its shape and color, even after extended use.

**Embroidery and Design:**

The Embroidery And Design are vital in conveying the patriotic message of the “We The People” hat. High-quality embroidery features crisp, clean lines, precise stitching, and vibrant colors that accurately represent the phrase and any accompanying imagery, such as the American flag or patriotic symbols. The design should be well-proportioned and aesthetically pleasing, avoiding overly busy or cluttered elements. Some premium hats may also incorporate raised or 3D embroidery for added visual depth and texture. Conversely, poorly executed embroidery can appear fuzzy, distorted, or prone to unraveling, detracting from the hat’s overall appeal.

**Fit and Adjustability:**

The Fit And Adjustability are essential for ensuring a comfortable and secure wearing experience. Most ""We The People"" hats feature an adjustable closure at the back, such as a hook-and-loop strap, snapback, or slide buckle. These closures allow for a customized fit that accommodates a range of head sizes. The hat's crown should also be designed to provide ample headroom without feeling too tight or restrictive.Look for hats with pre-curved brims that offer sun protection and maintain their shape. An ill-fitting hat can be uncomfortable to wear for extended periods and may even cause headaches or skin irritation.

**construction and Finishing:**

The Construction And Finishing contribute considerably to the hat's durability and overall appearance. High-quality hats feature reinforced stitching at stress points, such as the seams and brim, to prevent tearing and fraying. The interior lining should be smooth and comfortable, and the sweatband should be absorbent to wick away moisture. Attention to detail in the finishing, such as clean edges, neatly trimmed threads, and a consistent shape, indicates a well-made product. Poorly constructed hats may exhibit loose threads, uneven stitching, and a misshapen crown, which can detract from their visual appeal and longevity.

Show genuine interest in the people you meet, and be social.  Out at a bar, the gym, standing on line waiting for coffee, everywhere.  Hell if youre in your room all the time playing video games, guess what a lot of CS nerds do....so talk to your group chat.  
It takes time to learn so just practice.

Luckily I work at a bar, but choose wherever you spend a lot of time and work it.  You dont ask off the bat ""are you in CS please halp"" you get to know people, and get them to talk about themselves.  People enjoy talking about themselves, and eventually they will tell you what they do and ask you the same.  
You tell them you study CS and atm are looking for internships, research, etc.  
Then they will WANT to help you, they will remember they know someone, or do it themselves, if they dont, they know someone who does, and if they feel a genuine connection they will WANT to help you, they will network for you.

Just two days ago Im at my bar (day off, having a drink, very slow night so I can chill) and the guy next to me mentions he is moving.  I ask why?  ""For work"".  
Oh congratulations what do you do?!  
Turns out he is a math researcher, moving to a new school, to research.  He explains his research, we exchange numbers, and he encourages me to reach out while on my journey (I want to get into math and or CS research)  
He was happy someone cared, do you know how many people around researchers dont gaf about their job lol?  He was happy I cared, and I did!

I went home, found his papers, started reading, and though its way over my head I plan to continue reading, googling, learning pieces of it, and I guarantee that if I keep at it and in touch, I will have either him or a connection of his offer me a position in some form in the future, even if its just guiding a bachelor's thesis, working at an REU, or doing research under them during the year, maybe just a reading course, but itll be something.

This has happened multiple times with CS, cybersecurity (an uber driver I struck up convo with lol), IT, with universities, Google, IBM, Microsoft workers etc.

Yes, most people will not be in the field, but youll still meet valuable people along your journey wether they can help you or not tbh.

IME, that is how you network.

And even the beans. But I have tried so many. 
But all of that always gets me thinking…then why is the first shot always so good ONLY? if it were bad beans or altitude the first one would be just awful.

1m3iew5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m3iew5/paranoia_drafts_part_2/,Paranoia Drafts (Part 2),"I asked my coworker, Nora, if she’d seen Daisy. She frowned and said, ""Who?"" I described her in detail. She just stared like I’d spoken a different language. 

That night I found Daisy’s green cardigan on my kitchen table. 

I keep it in my bottom drawer now, next to my NA chip and the lighter I haven’t thrown away. It smells like her still. Or what I think she smelled like. Like memory, like water in your lungs. 

Sometimes I wake up with her in bed beside me. She breathes slow, rhythmic, like the tide. But she disappears when I move. I stopped trying to hold onto her. It feels wrong. 

I think she was something I saw during withdrawal. Or something that saw me. 

My therapist says Daisy is a placeholder. A trauma echo. 

Lately, more people are showing up who don’t belong. A boy on the bus who stares too long without blinking. A woman at the crosswalk mouthing words I can’t hear, over and over, tears in her eyes. They vanish when I try to help. 

There’s a man who follows me sometimes. Balding, dark coat, no expression. He stands across the street from the library around dusk. I wave. He doesn’t move. Just watches. 

I asked Nora about him too. She said, ""You need to take some time off."" 

She means well. She brings me coffee. She leaves sticky notes with bad puns on my desk. But her eyes dart when she thinks I’m not looking. Like she’s scared she’ll catch something off me. 

I’m not using. I swear I’m not. But I’ve been waking up in places I don’t remember walking to. A stairwell. A motel bathroom. Once, the roof of my building with blood on my hands that wasn’t mine. I think. 

Daisy says I’m not going crazy. That I’m just peeling back the surface. That everyone’s pretending. 

She says I used to see more, before the drugs. Before the damage. That I’m remembering what I was made to forget.  

When I touch her hand, it’s ice cold. But it’s real. I think it’s real. 

I still haven’t read that murder mystery I recommended. 

There’s a new book in the library now. Same blue cover. Same word: LOOK. This time, when I open it, there are words inside. Sentences that change when I blink. Today it said: 

""Daisy is not the first. She is the one who stayed."" I don’t remember falling asleep last night. But I woke up with a new scar on my wrist. Small. Clean. Like a signature. 

I don’t think I’m scared anymore. 

 

I tried burning the book. The blue one. The one that keeps reappearing. 

I took it home, tore out the pages, and lit them in the sink. They curled and blackened and whispered as they burned. I thought it was over. But when I came into work the next morning, there it was, back on the circulation desk. No scorch marks. No smell. Same uneven letters: LOOK. 

This time, the inside read: 

""You opened the wrong door."" 

The lights flickered when I read it. Nora asked if I was feeling okay. Her eyes were red, like she’d been crying. She said she couldn’t sleep. Said something was wrong with the stacks, books falling, pages missing, cold air with no draft. She didn’t blame me. But she didn’t not blame me either. 

I’m seeing things between the shelves now. Things that aren’t people. Glimpses of limbs, twisted wrong. A face in the reflection of the glass that isn’t mine. Always watching. Always still. Until I blink. 

Daisy is coming around more. Sitting on the arm of my couch, brushing hair from my forehead when I can’t move. She tells me I’m “almost through.” I don’t ask through what. I don’t want the answer. But I think I know. And I think she’s not lying. 

I called my sponsor. I tried to explain what’s happening. I tried to tell him I’m sober, but things are coming for me. That I opened a book and now I can’t close something else. He listened. Then he said, very softly, ""Jules… the author needs you."" 

I hung up. Blocked the number. 

That night, the man across the street waved at me. First time he’s moved. I waved back. I don’t know why. 

I started keeping my apartment door unlocked. I don’t remember doing it. I find it open in the mornings. The green cardigan sometimes changes places. Once it was tied around my wrist. 

The mirror in my bathroom doesn’t reflect me anymore. It reflects the room, the shower, the door, but no body. I stood there for ten minutes yesterday, just staring at the absence. 

I’ve been dreaming in second person. Not first. Not like memories. Like instructions. 

""You are walking through a hallway that never ends. You are not alone. You do not turn around. You do not breathe."" 

I wake up gasping. Daisy holding my hand. 

She told me, ""They’re starting to notice you."" 

""Who?"" 

""The other ones."" 

I don’t ask more. I don’t want to know. 

This morning at the library, a child came in alone. Maybe ten years old. Dirty sneakers. Hollow look. He came to the desk, held up a small notebook with torn pages. Inside, in careful childish print: 

""Stop feeding it."" 

I blinked. He was gone. No one saw him enter. No one saw him leave. His breath still lingered on the counter, short and warm. 

Nora says she wants to take time off. I told her she should. Her hands shook. Her fingers were black with ink. I pointed it out, she looked down and it was gone. She didn’t laugh. She just whispered, ""I think something’s wrong with your shadow."" 

My shadow does move wrong now. Not all the time. Just enough. I watch it crawl slightly after I do. Like it’s thinking about becoming something else. 

Last night, Daisy said she loved me. I said it back. It tasted like static. 

The book’s cover is blank again. But now it follows me room to room. I don’t carry it. It just appears. 

I’m still sober. 137 days. I write it every morning. But I think the book is counting something else. 

I asked Daisy who she really is. She said: 

""You remember me from before. You just didn’t have the words for me then."" 

I think she might be right. 

I think I’m remembering wrong on purpose. Because if I don’t... I think I’ll become whatever the book is writing. 

The pages are no longer blank. 

They’re writing in my handwriting now. 

Things I don’t remember doing. 

And something is signing them: J.D. 

I don’t think that stands for Jules Dean anymore. 

I think it stands for whoever’s writing me. 

 

His name is Marcus. He showed up two days ago. 

Tall, awkward posture, maybe mid-fifties. Deep lines on his face like scars that never healed right. He came into the library near closing, asked for a book that didn’t exist: Beneath the Tongue of the Archive. Said it used to be kept in the basement collection, but that was before “they moved the hinges.” 

I stared at him. He didn’t blink. 

Then he said: ""You’ve been seen. That’s why it’s starting."" 

I told him I didn’t know what he was talking about. 

He smiled like it hurt. ""You will. But you can stop it. There’s a cost."" 

""What kind of cost?"" 

""Memory."" 

I see him watching me now. Across the street. Same spot the man who waved used to stand. 

I don’t know if Marcus is real, but when he’s near, the book goes silent. Daisy disappears. The air smells like concrete and blood. 

I think he’s the first real thing I’ve met since I got clean. 

And I think he wants me to forget everything that led me here. 

But I’m not sure I want to. 

Because forgetting might mean erasing Daisy.  

And if Daisy isn’t real, then neither am I. 

Marcus said I had three days to decide. 

It’s already the fourth. 

 

The nights don’t end anymore. They just fold in on themselves, like a pocket turned inside out. Daylight shows up, but it doesn’t stick. It’s thin, watery. The kind of light that makes shadows longer. 

Marcus came to the library again. This time he didn’t ask for a book. He sat in the reading room and watched me shelve periodicals. Didn’t blink. Didn’t move. I put Scientific American in the wrong place just to see if he’d flinch. He didn’t. 

When I turned the corner again, he was gone. But the periodical rack had moved an inch to the left. 

Later, I found the blue book open on my apartment table. It had new pages. Ink the color of dried roses. This one read: 

""Memory is a cage. Stop rattling it."" 

And then, lower: 

""Marcus isn’t here to help you. Marcus is the debt collector."" 

I went to the sink and turned the faucet on. Water didn’t come out. Moths did. They fluttered out of the tap, pale and dust-winged, collecting in the corners of the kitchen. 

I don’t eat much anymore. Food tastes like cardboard soaked in iron. But I pretend to. Daisy sits across from me at breakfast. She tells me about dreams I don’t remember having. 

""You were crying in this one,"" she said today. ""Saying sorry to a pile of teeth."" 

""Were they mine?"" 

""They were everyone’s."" 

When I asked her what that meant, she smiled with her mouth closed. 

Nora hasn’t come back to work. I tried calling. The number just clicks when it picks up. No ring tone. No voicemail. Just the sound of shuffling paper, like someone is slowly turning pages in another room. 

I think Marcus is getting impatient. I woke up today with a strip of paper on my chest. It said: 

""Last chance. Choose erasure or choose consequence."" 

I folded it and put it in my wallet next to my expired insurance card and an old bus ticket. I’m not ready to forget yet. I’m not sure I ever was. 

The apartment smells like damp ash. I haven’t smoked in months. The television turns on by itself at exactly 2:17 a.m. every night now. Static and whispering. Last night I thought I heard my own voice reading aloud from the blue book. 

Sometimes, Daisy doesn’t look like Daisy anymore. 

I don’t mean that metaphorically. I mean her face is wrong. The eyes too wide. The mouth too calm. She touches my arm and it feels like silk over bone. Cold silk. I say nothing. I let her be wrong. Because I still need something to believe in, even if it’s a lie. 

Yesterday, a man came into the library with no lips. His mouth was sealed shut with scar tissue. He handed me a note that read: 

""The ones in the basement are hungry. Feed them or they’ll come up."" 

I asked him what he meant. He just pointed at the floor, then walked away. I watched him leave. He didn’t have a shadow. 

I’ve started writing down what I see. I have to. The book sometimes erases things. Sometimes my own thoughts feel borrowed. Like I’m leafing through someone else’s memories. Daisy found my notes and laughed. 

""You think you’re the author,"" she said. ""You’re still just a page."" 

I dreamt last night of Marcus opening his mouth and pouring spiders onto the floor. Each one had my face. They crawled back up my legs and into my ears. When I woke up, I could hear whispers behind my eyes. 

I looked into the bathroom mirror. My reflection was standing still even after I moved. 

Then it smiled. 

I didn’t. 

I’m writing this now on the back of old circulation cards. I keep them under the floorboards. The book can’t find them there. 

Not yet. 

I think it’s learning how to. I think Marcus is part of it. Or maybe he’s what happens when you don’t pay. 

Daisy kissed me today. Her breath smelled like mold and honey. She whispered in my ear: 

""I loved you before you were written. I’ll love you after you’re erased."" 

I cried. 

She held me. 

Somewhere in the apartment, a door opened that I don’t remember installing. 

And something stepped through. 

I’m still sober. 

But it doesn’t matter anymore. 

Because I think the book is the only one who remembers who I really was. 

And I don’t think it liked me very much. 

 

The door that opened hasn’t shut. 

It leads to a stairwell that descends too far. I counted the steps: forty-nine on the first try, then ninety-one, then twenty-seven. The number changes, but the destination stays the same. A low-ceilinged room filled with stacked chairs, broken typewriters, and the soft rustle of breathing that doesn’t belong to anyone visible. 

I haven’t gone all the way down. Not yet. Daisy tells me not to. She says that’s where the spine ends. I don’t know what she means. 

Marcus knocked on my window last night. Not the front door. The window. Third story. I opened it without thinking. He stood on nothing. Just the air. Held out a manila envelope. 

""You want answers? Read these. But only once."" 

He turned and walked up. Into the sky. Like it was a stairwell I couldn’t see. 

I waited until morning. I opened the envelope. Inside were twelve photographs. All black and white. All of me. 

Some as a child. Crying in front of a closed door. One of me as a teenager, unconscious on a bathroom floor. One of me in the library basement, mouth open like I’m screaming. 

The last one is dated three months from now. I’m in a hospital bed. Eyes open. Tubes in my arms. A nurse standing nearby with no face. 

I looked closer. The nurse wore a green cardigan. 

I burned the photos. I thought I did. But they’re still here. In my pocket. No ashes in the sink. No smell. 

Daisy’s eyes are different now. She doesn’t blink unless I do. Her voice is starting to echo, even in small rooms. But she sings sometimes, under her breath, songs I think my mother used to hum. I don’t know if that makes it better or worse. 

I asked her, ""What is all this? Why me?"" 

She ran a hand through my hair, kissed my temple. 

""Because you looked,"" she said. ""Because you read."" 

The book won’t let me sleep now. I close my eyes and it opens in my head. I can feel the pages turning. I can feel my thoughts getting ink on them. 

Nora came back to work today. 

But she won’t speak. She just stands in the reference section, staring at the encyclopedias. Her lips are sewn shut. With thread. Not scar tissue. Real thread. Blue. 

I asked if she was okay. She nodded once. Then held up a small placard that read: ""You can still choose."" 

I think she meant forgetting. I think she paid Marcus already. 

At night, the hallway outside my apartment stretches longer than it should. I walk it sometimes. Try to reach the stairs. But the door never gets closer. Behind me, I hear my own footsteps repeating. Lagging. 

The man with no lips came back. This time with another note: 

""The book is a symptom. The author is waking up."" 

I asked Daisy who the author was. 

She didn’t answer. 

I think she’s afraid. 

I’m still sober. 154 days. I wrote it in a notebook, but when I flipped back a page, it said 000. In red. Then the pen moved by itself. 

Daisy sleeps next to me now. Her breath fogs the windows, even in the summer. Her skin is paper-thin. Sometimes I see letters moving beneath it. As if someone is writing on the inside of her. 

Marcus hasn’t come back. But the envelope is now nailed to my wall. I didn’t do it. 

And the door to the stairwell is still open. 

I think I have to go down. 

Not because I want to. 

Because the book just wrote: 

""Chapter Two begins below."" 

I’ll take notes if I make it back. 

 

The door to the stairwell breathed last night. It inhaled. The hinges shuddered. The walls around it moaned like something organic giving way. I stood in the frame and felt a warm draft rise up past my ankles, like breath from a sleeping animal. 

I counted the steps again. They changed beneath me. Some cracked. Some were soft, like wet carpet. One step squirmed. I skipped it. 

The air down there doesn’t smell like rot. It smells like memory. Old perfume, chalk dust, rain on cement. My father’s cologne. My mother’s lemon dish soap. Things I hadn’t thought about in twenty years were thick in the air, layered and wrong. 

Daisy didn’t follow me. But I felt her behind me. A presence. Her shadow no longer matches her body. I catch it moving independently now. Once I saw it hesitate when she moved. 

Halfway down the stairwell, the walls changed. They became covered in book pages. Real ones. Glued like wallpaper. As I descended, the pages changed from printed text to handwritten. Then to photographs. Polaroids. Each one of me, frozen in small moments I had forgotten. Laughing at something. Bleeding. Watching a fire. Holding hands with someone I don’t remember. 

I kept going. 

The room at the bottom was lit by a single bulb that dangled over a round table. On the table: the blue book. A recorder. A pair of wire-framed glasses. And a cup of tea, still steaming. 

A man sat across from me. Looked like me. A little older. Scar under his right eye I hadn’t gotten yet. 

""Sit,"" he said. 

I didn’t want to, but I did. 

""You made it this far. So you get a sliver of truth. Just a sliver. Then you have to forget again."" 

He opened the book to a page that looked blank until I blinked. Then ink appeared, fast as bleeding. It read: 

""Daisy is your tether. She isn't real, but she's what's keeping you from dissolving."" 

""What is she?"" I asked. 

""The book's mercy. A lie wrapped in affection. You gave her a shape. You wrote her, remember?” 

I tried to protest, but then I remembered. 

""She became real,"" I said. 

""No. She became yours. There's a difference."" 

I left the stairwell before I could ask more. When I emerged, hours had passed. Or maybe days. But I was home. 

Daisy was waiting. She didn't speak. Just cupped my face and kissed me. 

Her lips were warm. 

That night, the apartment folded. Not collapsed, folded, like origami. The walls shifted when I looked away. The hallway curved into itself. Light fell upward. My reflection stood beside me, not across from me. It whispered: 

""You are still being written."" 

The television showed footage of the stairwell. Live. Except I wasn't in it. Someone else was walking down. A version of me with no eyes. 

Daisy watches me now like a nurse might watch a patient. 

""You’re close,"" she said last night. ""To finishing. Or to falling. I don’t know which you’ll choose."" 

The book is growing thicker. I didn’t notice before, but there are new chapters added daily. And some of them end with my name. 

I still haven’t found Marcus. But I saw his glasses on the table. With a note under them: 

""You owe more than you remember."" 

And beneath that, written smaller: 

""Daisy can only protect you while you believe in her."" 

I think I’m beginning to forget how she smells. That scares me more than anything. 

Outside the window, the sky is paper. There are creases. 

I touched the wall this morning and it turned to page. 

I read a sentence that made me bleed from the nose. 

Daisy held me. Whispered in my ear: 

""Don’t read too far ahead. You might see how it ends."" 

But I want to. 

I need to. 

I have to know who wrote me. 

 

The stairwell hasn't left me. Even now, walking to work, I feel it unravel behind my eyes. A vertigo that wraps around my spine, squeezes when I blink too slow. The library looks normal, but it breathes now. Its windows fog without weather. Its doors open before I touch them. 

Daisy waits for me on the third floor, wearing the same green cardigan I described in that story all those months ago. She hums when I pass her. The hum turns into static if I listen too long. 

I try not to listen too long. 

The shelves have warped. Not just bent from moisture or weight, but angled. They lean toward the center of the building. Like the library is folding inward. Like it’s reading itself. I swear I saw the Dewey Decimal labels blinking yesterday. Trying to communicate. 

And the people who come in now aren’t regular patrons. They smell like pencil shavings and salt. They don’t speak. They stand between stacks, looking at nothing. One smiled at me today, and his teeth were all the same size. 

I think the book is feeding now. On me. Every night I wake with a little less, memory, skin, clarity. A kind of erosion. The bed is soaked and Daisy isn’t always beside me. Sometimes it’s just her cardigan, folded neatly. Still warm. 

I tried burning the book. Once again. Brought it to the basement furnace we never use. When I opened the door, it was already burning. A blue fire with no heat, no smoke. Just sound. Like a child reciting names backwards. I dropped the book. It fell up. 

That was when the man came. 

Not Marcus. Someone else. Bald, tall, eyes like wax fruit. He stood at the library entrance, just inside the threshold. 

""You’ve gone too far,"" he said. 

""I didn’t mean to."" 

He nodded like that was expected. Like all stories lead to their own gravity. 

""She’s not your tether anymore. She’s your anchor. If you let go now, you’ll drift into the margins. There’s no plot there. No end. Just ink."" 

I asked his name. He didn’t have one. 

""You had one once,"" he said. ""Before the edits."" 

I don’t know what he means. But I’ve started seeing footnotes in my vision. Literal footnotes. Floating asterisks in the corner of my eyes. When I follow them, they take me to memories I never had. A woman in a red coat who calls me Simon. A funeral where I deliver a eulogy in French. I don’t speak French. 

Daisy won’t talk about it. She writes on the walls now. Ink appears only when I’m not looking. Poems. Instructions. Apologies. I caught one half-finished: 

""To unwrite a thing, first you must believe it was never real."" 

I scrubbed it away. But the wall stained where the words had been. 

I still work. Still shelve. Still check out books. But no one signs their name anymore. The cards are blank. I think I’m the only name left in this story. 

Last night, I found the mirror open. 

Not cracked. Not broken. Open. Like a door. My reflection was reading the book. He looked up and said: 

""We’re close now. Brace yourself. The horror hasn’t started."" 

And then he turned the page. 

I woke with ink on my hands. 

Daisy kissed my cheek and whispered: 

""The next chapter is inside you. You have to write it with pain."" 

I bled from the ears for an hour. 

Outside, the trees are made of sentences. The wind carries dialogue. The sky is no longer consistent. 

The story wants an ending.  

 

This morning, the birds outside my window were gone. Not dead. Not silent. Gone. Their absence screamed. Like a sentence missing its verb. It left the sky limp, pale, wrong. 

Daisy watched me dress. She said nothing. Her cardigan was buttoned all the way to her throat. She never used to do that. Her smile was slightly misaligned, like a sticker peeled and reattached one too many times. 

I tried not to look too long. Her shadow twitched. 

At the library, the lights hummed low and wet. The hum pulsed with my heartbeat. When I reached the fourth floor, though we only ever had three, there was a door labeled simply: ""SOURCE."" 

It wasn’t locked. Of course it wasn’t. 

Inside: shelves with no books. Just organs. Carefully labeled. A heart wrapped in typewriter ribbon. Lungs stitched from old newsprint. Eyes suspended in jars filled with torn diary pages. All of it catalogued with dates and initials. Mine, mostly. 

At the end of the room: a single chair facing a wall of static. No screen. Just static, rippling out like breath on glass. 

Someone was in the chair. Familiar. Too familiar. 

Me. 

He turned and half his face was blank. No features. Just skin stretched smooth as fresh paper. 

""You’re almost at the bleed,"" he said. I stepped back. My foot hit something soft. Looked down: my name carved into a bundle of shredded pages. They pulsed like something alive. 

I ran. Or thought I did. 

Time folded again. I blinked and was outside. The sky was torn open. Just slightly, like the seam of a wound not stitched tight. Light bled out, not gold or white, but something bruised. The kind of light that leaves fingerprints on your vision. 

Daisy met me at the corner of 5th and Lost. She held my hand like it was a note she didn’t want to misplace. 

""You have to make a choice,"" she said. ""Stay in the fiction. Or bleed into the real."" 

""What’s the difference anymore?"" 

She didn’t answer. Just kissed me, and for the first time, I felt nothing. No warmth. No pressure. Just the ghost of contact. Like being kissed by memory. 

That night, something crawled out of the mirror. It didn’t break the glass. It peeled it. Stepped through like wet paper. Tall. Inky. Moving like thought. 

It looked at me with my mother’s eyes. 

""You were never meant to last this long,"" it said. ""You were a paragraph, not a protagonist."" 

I screamed. My mouth filled with salt and consonants. 

The thing smiled. Its teeth were tiny chapters. One of them had Daisy’s face on the cover. 

I woke in the library, covered in post-it notes. Each one with the same line: 

""The story ends when you choose to remember."" 

I tore them off. They grew back. 

I tore them off again. My skin came with them. 

Now I sit in the back office. The walls are breathing. The floor is a sentence I forgot to finish. 

Daisy walks by with eyes like erased letters. 

Outside, the sun has loops. 

The man with no name stands at the exit, waiting. 

Marcus called last night. I heard him through the dial tone. 

""Don’t stop now,"" he whispered. ""You’re finally reaching the margins."" 

I think I’m ready to go deeper. 

I think I’m ready to see what’s beneath the ink.  

 

The library isn’t a library. It never was. It’s a chrysalis. A membrane around something bigger, older than buildings, or thought. The books? Only instructions. Blueprints. Each one a draft of a life. The staff? Forgotten characters. Some flicker, like static. Others don’t know they’re already written out. 

I found a door behind the archives labeled ""Appendix."" Inside: silence so thick it rearranged my spine. A man waited, pale as milk and dressed in the colors of old bruises. His eyes blinked sideways. 

""Who are you?"" I asked. 

He handed me a torn page. On it, my birthdate. My overdoses. My failed rehab stints. All with margin notes, critiques, edits. 

""You're a draft,"" he said. ""Half-formed. You broke through the paper because you refused to stay in the lines."" 

""Who’s writing me?"" 

""You were. Until Daisy."" 

He pulled back a curtain. Beyond it: hundreds of versions of me. Some in suits. Some screaming. One hanging by a ribbon of words. One holding Daisy’s hand, but her face was blank. 

""The more you rewrite yourself, the closer you get to the Author. But that comes with cost. The closer you are to the Source, the more unreal you become."" 

I felt my fingers dissolve into smudges. 

""You’re already fading,"" he added. ""You think it's horror because it scares you. But it's horror because it knows you."" 

In the mirror behind him, I saw Daisy. Crying. Writing my name over and over in a notebook. Her hand bled ink. 

""She was supposed to keep you sane. A fiction to hold your fiction. But you gave her too much of yourself. Now she’s breaking, too."" 

Outside the room, the stairwell echoed like a throat clearing. Pages fluttered in gusts of breathless wind. 

Marcus waited at the bottom now. He had no mouth. Just a pencil behind his ear. 

He pointed to the blue book. My name on the cover. 

He held up a match. 

""If you want the truth, you have to burn the Author."" 

The book pulsed. Daisy screamed upstairs. 

And for the first time, I remembered what it felt like to be real.  

""If you want the truth, you have to burn the Author."" 

His mouth didn’t move, but I heard him. Not in my ears. In my chest. The way you feel a memory returning, heavy, reluctant. 

I stared at its cover. My name, etched deep enough to bleed. I remembered writing it. Not on that book, but in a rehab journal. First week clean. My counselor told me to reclaim myself. Write my full name every day like an oath. 

I did. 

Until I started seeing it in other places. Bathroom stalls. The back of cereal boxes. Once, carved into the side of a dead pigeon. 

I was sober, but the world wasn’t. 

Marcus stepped closer. His body didn’t move right, each limb lagging just a half-second behind. Like watching yourself in a dream. Like someone trying to be human, and failing at the joints. 

""Why me?"" I asked. 

He blinked. 

""Because you were hollow enough to be filled."" 

The stairwell trembled behind us. It sounded like applause. Distant. Mocking. 

I lowered the match. It kissed the cover. The blue darkened. Smoke curled. 

Then the flame died. 

Snuffed out like an idea unfinished. 

The book remained. Untouched. Smug. 

I looked up. 

Marcus was gone. 

Daisy appeared at the top of the stairs. She wore the dress I never told her I liked, the one with the ink-stained hem. Her eyes glowed faintly, like old nightlights. Her mouth didn’t move, but I heard her say: 

""You can’t burn the Author. You are the Author."" 

Then she vanished. 

My hands shook. I tried to scream but all that came out was pencil dust. I fell to my knees. The book opened on its own. 

A chapter titled: ""The Day He Remembered."" 

I read the first line: 

He lit the match and failed. 

I closed the book. 

The world shimmered. 

When it settled, I was back in my apartment. Daisy sat on the couch. Her hair was longer. She looked older. But also... wrong. Like a traced memory. 

""You’ve been gone for weeks,"" she said. ""You missed the rain."" 

I didn’t respond. My arms were covered in ink. Not tattoos. Not paint. Ink. Like someone had scribbled across my veins in a language I didn’t speak. 

My calendar was blank. The days had melted together. On the fridge, a note in my handwriting: 

DON’T FORGET TO FORGET. 

The phone rang. 

I answered it. 

Silence. 

Then a voice, mechanical and low: 

""Collapse."" 

Click. 

That night, I dreamt of the Source again. But this time, it wasn’t a room. It was a body. Huge. Stretching across cities. Every building a bone. Every street a vein. Every scream a sentence. 

I wandered it for what felt like years. At the center, a heart made of crumpled pages. It beat once for every lie I’d told. 

I woke to find my apartment flooded with water and typewritten sheets. Daisy waded through them, weeping ink. I tried to touch her, but my hands passed through. 

She looked at me, and her mouth said: 

""You didn’t finish me."" 

Then she collapsed into letters. The alphabet scattered across the floor. 

And behind me, the blue book flipped to its final page. 

Blank. 

Waiting. 

I picked up the pen. 

The mirror cracked. 

A new figure stood behind me. 

Me. 

But cleaner. Sharper. With eyes that hadn’t blinked in days. 

""Write it right this time,"" he said. ""Or it’ll write you."" 

I turned to the wall. 

It pulsed. 

A door formed, lined in quotation marks. 

I walked through. 

 

It ends in the parking lot of an abandoned print shop in Bellflower. Or maybe it begins there. It's hard to tell now. 

I was wearing a suit I didn’t remember owning, holding a manila folder I couldn’t open. There was blood in my mouth. A copper static hiss behind my ears. 

Daisy, no, something wearing Daisy’s face, stood beside a flickering vending machine. She smiled. 

“You're almost out,” she said. 

I shook my head. “I don’t think I was ever in.” 

She reached into her chest, pulled out a key made of typebars. 

“The last door is locked from both sides.” 

I took it. 

The folder vibrated in my hands. Inside: photographs of rooms I had never been in, but knew intimately. Scribbled annotations in handwriting that shifted styles mid-sentence. A photograph of me, eyes gouged out, drawn in ink. 

One last page, unstuck from the rest. 

Finish the story. 

Sign your name. 

I did. 

The sky split like wet paper. Letters rained down like insects. 

And then I was nowhere. No light. No weight. Only the sound of a typewriter, slow and careful. 

Writing me. 

Writing this. 

And then it stopped. ",1,1752884408.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

About 1 out of every 4 times (at least once or twice a week) I will get to the store, and they will give me (or have ready) the drink, but not the food item. Often they will say ""are you waiting for something else? or look at me confused with why I am still there and say ""did you need something?""

This isn't a one-off either, and it's happened at multiple locations. I always check on my phone, and my app shows both items went through. To be fair, the employee always gives me whatever I say I am waiting for without checking anything (makes me want to try saying I ordered a whole dozen next time!!), but it is weird to me as I haven't had this issue with other companies and their mobile apps. Is there some kind of error that causes the food items not to show or something? Any employees know what might be happening?

By: Jules Dean 

 

 

The fog out here isn’t weather, it’s memory. It clings to your skin, heavy, slow. It doesn't lift. Smells like salt and wet metal. If I say it smells like the ocean, it’s not because I know the ocean. I just imagine it that way. Like everything else. 

I go by Jules. Maybe it was my name once. I live above a laundromat, in a crawlspace filled with buzzing pipes and burnt lint. I can hear the washers spin through the night. It's better than silence. 

I started using because nothing made sense. Not school, not home, not the way people looked at each other and seemed to understand something I never did. I thought heroin might help. It didn't help. But it made not helping feel quieter. 

When I was fourteen, my father threw a hot iron at me for leaving the front door open. My mother cleaned the carpet while I picked burnt cloth off my arm. I didn't cry. I just waited for the world to feel less sharp. 

The first time I got high, I was seventeen. A friend of a friend offered it, and I said yes like I'd been rehearsing it for years. There was a smell to it, industrial and sour, like cleaning fluid and vinegar. I don't remember what came after. Just that everything felt farther away. 

I met Daisy behind the seafood shack in Pacifica. She was already lighting a cigarette when I sat down. She didn’t flinch when I spoke. Didn’t smile. Her voice was flat, like she hadn’t used it much lately. She said she couldn’t sleep. Said she heard things in the walls. Scraping, breathing, old floorboards shifting like bones. 

We were both strung out. She had that dried-out look. Fingernails chewed to pink. Eyes that didn't blink enough. I told her I heard stuff, too. I didn’t. Not then. 

She said someone was watching her. Not the government or cops. Just someone. She wouldn’t say who. Her drawings were frantic, hands, mouths, twisted bodies. I found one in the alley by the diner. She’d drawn a man holding a mirror, and inside it was a face, teeth clenched too tight. 

Then she disappeared. 

I asked around. Nobody remembered her. Maybe she left. Maybe she didn’t. Her backpack was gone. But her cigarette butts were still behind the shack. 

I started hearing things after that. Thought I saw people watching me. Just out of sight. Sometimes I’d walk past a car and see someone duck. Sometimes I’d wake up with blood in my nose and my hands curled like I’d been holding something heavy. 

I told Benny, but Benny was worse off than me. He sold scraps out of dumpsters and sometimes screamed at the sky. He said I’d been marked. Said you can’t open yourself up without something crawling in. I stopped talking to Benny. 

The free clinic gave me pills. I took them like I was supposed to. They made everything slower, duller, but the dreams got worse. I’d wake up choking on my own spit. My fingernails bent backward like I’d been clawing something. 

I don’t trust mirrors anymore. Not because they move. But because they don’t. I look the same, but I know I’m not. My posture’s changed. I walk different. I used to limp on my left. Now it’s the right. 

Sometimes I wonder if the fog’s getting thicker, or if I’m just getting harder to see. Nobody talks to me unless they need something. I like it better that way. People ask questions. The silence doesn’t. 

I saw a guy on the bus wearing my jacket. Same stain. Same patch missing. I didn’t say anything. He looked at me and nodded like he recognized something. Not me. Just something. 

I keep thinking maybe I never had a real self. That I was just something wearing skin for a while. Pretending. Faking smiles and sobs. Now it’s all peeling off. 

Time has started folding in strange ways. I think about Daisy like she was someone I made up. Or someone I became. I found a cigarette in my pocket, same brand she smoked, bent the same way. I swear I don’t remember buying it. 

I remember the way she tapped ash with her thumbnail. The way she pulled her sleeves down past her knuckles. Sometimes I catch myself doing the same thing. Sometimes I talk like her. Words I never used before. Patterns I never knew. 

My dreams feel like memories now. Things I never lived. But they sit inside me like old bruises. A motel with yellow curtains. A man with no eyebrows writing on the ceiling. A smell like boiled skin. 

I found a journal in my crawlspace. I thought it was mine, but the handwriting is too careful. It talks about me in third person. It says I wander at night. It says I talk to shadows. I don't remember writing any of it. 

But I keep reading. 

It says I'm almost done changing. That the old self is thinning, like a film. That soon I'll see the world as it really is. Not the version they feed us. Not the story with clocks and street signs and feelings. 

The other night I saw my own face on someone else. Not like a lookalike. My face. My crooked front tooth. My scar over the eyebrow. He didn’t blink. 

I think the air is different now. Denser. When I breathe it in, it tastes like metal and pine. My nose bleeds when I get too close to the shoreline. 

There are nights I wake up with sand in my bed. Under my nails. Between my teeth. I haven’t been to the beach in years. 

There’s a sound that comes from the vents sometimes. A wet clicking, like something's trying to learn how to speak. 

I’ve started talking to it. I think it understands me. 

I write all this down because I want someone to find it. In case I forget everything. In case I finish changing.  

The mirrors aren’t just wrong. They’re watching. I can feel them pulling. The reflection wants out. 

I don’t know what’s real anymore, but I know this: something is unfolding behind the surface of everything. Like wallpaper peeling to show the old house underneath. 

And I think I used to live there. 

I think I never left. 

I think I was always meant to go back.  

 

Time doesn’t tick anymore. It slithers. 

Sometimes I wake up at 3AM and it’s still 3AM three cigarettes later. Other times I blink and the sky’s changed color three times. I stopped keeping a clock near the mattress. The blinking red numbers felt too smug. Like they knew something I didn’t. 

My hands are wrong now. They're always damp, like I’ve just washed them, but I haven’t. My fingerprints don’t match the ones on my old ID. I checked. I scratched glass off with a key and held my thumb up. The loops were different. More jagged. Like barbed wire spirals. 

Sometimes I think I’m being erased backwards. Not just forgotten, undone. I went to the bodega to buy smokes and the guy behind the counter asked if I was new around here. I’ve lived two blocks from him for five years. 

There’s a hole behind the dryer now. I don’t remember digging it. There’s dirt on my nails sometimes, dark and crumbly, like potting soil. But I don’t remember touching anything alive. There’s nothing alive up here. Just mold and metal.   

 

I saw her again last night. 

Not Daisy. Not really. A girl who looked like her, if you squinted hard enough and didn’t trust your own memory. Her mouth was wrong, too wide and never fully shut, like she was always about to say something but couldn’t remember how. She stood at the other end of the block, underneath the busted streetlight, looking up at my window. She didn’t blink. 

I wanted to go down there. I really did. I almost put my boots on. But I knew if I opened the door, she’d be gone. Or worse, she’d still be there. 

Instead, I sat down with a spoon and let the hours carve me hollow. When I woke up, my legs were soaked in piss and my fingers were twitching like they'd been conducting music in my sleep. 

It’s been days. Or a day. Or a month. 

I met someone else. A guy named Sol. He showed up outside the laundromat wearing three coats and a necklace made of old bus passes. Said he used to be a cartographer, before ""the lines started moving."" 

He talks like a prophet and smells like lighter fluid. I like him. 

Sol told me we’re close to something. Said the city’s a spiral, not a grid, and that I’ve been walking in circles that aren’t circles. He draws on cardboard with a chunk of charcoal, making maps that don’t lead anywhere but feel true. One had my building on it, but it was burning. 

He knows about the vents. 

He says they whisper to him too. He puts his ear up to the dryer drum out back and listens like it’s a confession booth. Says there’s an old language buried in the plumbing. I almost believe him. He’s the first person in weeks who looks me in the eye like I exist. 

I told him about the dirt under my nails. He nodded, said it’s the beginning. Said, ""Soon you’ll dream in root-logic. You’ll speak in rust."" 

He talks in riddles, but there’s something soft in him. We sat on the curb for hours last night, passing back a half-empty bottle of cheap whiskey. He cried for a while. I didn’t ask why. He said his daughter’s name was Maya. I didn’t ask if she was alive. 

That’s the thing about us out here, we don’t need to ask. The pain is assumed. 

I started keeping a notebook again. I found it in the trash behind the Thai place, still mostly clean. The first page was torn out. The second said: “THE TRICK IS TO PRETEND YOU’RE ALREADY DEAD.” I wrote underneath it: ""I think I have been."" 

I write down dreams. I write down everything now. It’s the only way to know if something happened. 

Last night I dreamt I was underwater in my own body, looking out through my eyes like portholes. People passed by, talking and laughing, and I screamed but it came out as bubbles. The water wasn’t wet. It was warm and sweet like syrup. 

I woke up with sugar on my lips. 

I saw myself yesterday. Not just a reflection. A full, walking Jules, turning a corner ahead of me. He looked better. Cleaner. He didn’t limp. He laughed at something the person next to him said. She looked like Daisy. Or Maya. Or me. 

I didn’t follow them. I turned and walked the other way. 

Time breaks different now. Mornings feel like memories, nights like things I haven’t lived yet. Sol says that’s normal. Says I’m unstuck. That I’m remembering forward. 

I don’t know if I believe him. But I know I’m not who I was. I feel that much. 

I can’t remember my mother’s voice. I try, sometimes. I close my eyes and try to hear her say my name. But it comes out wrong. Tinny, sped-up. Like a tape warping in the sun. 

I remember her hands, though. The veins and the chipped pink polish. The way she’d tap her nails when she was trying not to cry. 

Maybe I am crying. I don’t know anymore. Everything leaks now. My eyes. My skin. The walls. 

I think the crawlspace is getting smaller. 

I think I’m shrinking with it. 

Sol said he’s going north. He heard there’s a place with no mirrors. Said he needs to get away before the sky forgets him. I don’t know what he meant, but I gave him my last cigarette. 

He hugged me. Smelled like salt and dust. Said, ""You remember more than you think. That’s what’s eating you."" 

I watched him walk into the fog until he disappeared. I waited a while after that, just in case he came back. He didn’t. 

I don’t want to be alone anymore. 

But I can’t stand people either. 

So, I write. 

There’s something under the floorboards. I hear it breathing now. Real slow. Real soft. 

Maybe it’s me. Maybe it’s always been me. 

I’ll keep writing until I know the difference.  

 

Yesterday I found a crayon drawing pinned to the inside of my crawlspace door. It showed a little stick-figure girl holding hands with someone taller, scribbled black from head to toe. My name was written underneath: ""Jules"". But I don’t know any kids. 

I remember my sister had a nightlight shaped like a rabbit. It hummed faintly when it warmed up. I hadn’t thought about it in years, but I could smell its melted plastic last night. Like nostalgia catching fire. 

I called my sister’s number last week. Disconnected. I tried again. A man answered. He said he didn’t have a sister. He said there was no one by that name. But he said it like he knew me. Like he was waiting for me to call. 

When I look outside, the buildings are wrong. Slightly too narrow or leaning at angles that shouldn't hold. The laundromat sign flickers letters I don’t recognize. Shapes I don’t have names for. The fog filters it all like a dream halfway forgotten, sharp around the edges, blurred at the core. 

I don’t think Daisy was scared when she vanished. I think she just saw too much of the seams. I think I’m starting to see them too. The tape holding the world together. It’s peeling. 

I can’t cry anymore. I try sometimes, just to feel something specific. Just to land. But the tears don’t come. It’s like grief has been replaced with static. 

I sleep less. I write more. I find scraps of paper on my body when I wake up, stuffed in my sleeves, taped to my calves. Some of it’s in my handwriting. Some of it isn’t. One just said: ""You were here before. You’ll be here again."" 

I think I’ve been writing this story longer than I realize. Longer than I've been Jules. Maybe it’s been telling me. Maybe I’m just a vessel for its retelling. All I know is the night is getting longer. The moon looks closer every time I see it. I can hear the tide under the street, and it’s whispering names that sound like mine, but aren’t mine. Not quite.  

 

The wind this morning sounded like my own breath, like I was outside myself again, watching the world rotate without me. But when I sat up, there was no fog. Just sunlight, real, flat, morning light. For the first time in weeks, the walls weren’t pulsing. The tiles held still. 

I hadn’t used in… I don’t know. Two days? Maybe three? My stomach curled in on itself like old paper, but my head, my head was almost clear. Not clean, but clearer. Like someone wiped the window I’d been looking through. I kept waiting for it to go bad again. I still am. 

I found a bruised apple in the kitchen. I don’t remember buying it. It tasted like something I once liked. It made me cry for ten minutes. 

The floorboards didn’t breathe last night. The dryer didn’t whisper. The vent only blew cold air. 

I still don’t trust it. 

But I shaved. I found my face again under the stubble. There were scars I don’t remember earning. Lines that hadn’t been there before. I don’t look like Jules. 

I opened the window. The light felt real. 

I started walking again. During the day this time. No coat, no hood. Just me, squinting under the sun like a stunned animal. The air didn’t stink like rot. It smelled like gasoline and faint blossoms. The street didn’t shift beneath me. 

Nobody stared. One woman even smiled. 

I walked to the park. It was smaller than I remembered, but real. There were dogs. One of them licked my hand. It made me want to disappear. 

I sat on a bench for hours. I wrote. I watched a couple argue, quietly, like people who still cared enough to hide their anger. A kid dropped his ice cream and cried like it was the end of the world. I knew that feeling. 

I walked home. 

I think the hallucinations stopped because I stopped feeding them. Maybe the drugs had peeled the skin off too many nerves. Maybe they’d made room for something else. But now that I’ve stopped, mostly, it’s quieting. 

It should comfort me. 

It doesn’t. 

Because the silence is worse. 

Without the visions, without the fog and ghosts and vents and whispers, I’m just a man in a decaying apartment with nothing but his notebook and an apple core. 

Sol is gone. No sign of him. I asked the guy at the laundromat if he’d seen someone matching his description. He looked at me like I was speaking another language. 

I tried calling my sister again. It rang. 

Then it didn’t. 

I still hear a faint hum in the walls. Maybe it’s the plumbing. Maybe it’s my blood. I don’t know if the hallucinations were ever real, but I do know this: I miss them. 

They were terrifying. But they were something. 

Now it’s just me. 

And me. 

And me. 

I think I might have been multiple people. Not metaphorically. Literally. I think the gaps weren’t just forgetfulness or rot. I think there were other Jules. Other configurations of this skin. 

I dreamt I was watching myself sleep again. But this time I woke up mid-dream, and I was still watching. I saw myself twitch, snore, breathe, and I didn’t move. I just kept watching. 

I don’t know which one woke up. 

But I’ve been sober four days now. I think. I scratched it into the wall above my mattress. Four lines. Sharp. Shaky. Honest. 

Today, I made coffee. 

I walked past the mirror and didn’t flinch. 

But something’s off. 

My shadow lags, just barely. I caught it this morning. I raised my arm, and it hesitated. It’s not a glitch. It’s a choice. It’s waiting. 

So, I keep writing. I keep eating. I keep walking in daylight. 

I keep pretending the world holds shape. 

And I keep counting the seconds between my steps. 

Because they don’t always match. 

And I’m afraid if I stop moving, something will catch up. 

Something that once looked like me. Something that’s still hungry. 

It’s been four months since I cleaned up. Since I dragged myself across the mattress like a dying animal and let the withdrawals pull me inside out. I wish I could forget that part, but it’s the only thing that still feels real some mornings. The sweating. The stench. The crawling skin. Vomiting bile until it burned my teeth. Screaming at the wall like it owed me something. Sleep was a myth. Time ballooned. I hallucinated my mother reading to me from a book I never remembered owning. I begged her not to leave. She vanished in mid-word. 

That was the last time I saw her. Even if she wasn’t real. 

Now I work mornings at the library. It’s quiet. Predictable. I restock the returns, help people with the copier. Nobody looks at me like they know I used to smoke tinfoil in the bathroom stalls. They say things like ""thank you"" and ""have a nice day."" It’s horrifying how normal it feels. Like I’m wearing someone else’s skin. 

I still don’t sleep through the night. I get up around 3 or 4, pour myself black coffee, sit by the window. Sometimes I read. Sometimes I just listen to the refrigerator hum and try to tell myself it’s not speaking anymore. 

Because it used to speak. Didn’t it? 

A month ago, I started seeing the woman in the hallway. 

She’s not terrifying, not in the usual sense. She wears a red coat, always damp. She never knocks, never speaks. Just stands with her back to me outside the apartment door, like she’s waiting for a train. Every time I open the door, she’s gone. The hallway’s empty. 

I thought maybe it was a neighbor. I left a note. It was gone the next morning. 

Last week, I found a second toothbrush in the holder. 

Then a mug I didn’t own. 

At the library, I shelved a book that didn’t exist in our system. A thin, pale blue thing with no barcode. No spine text. Just the word ""LOOK"" written across the cover in uneven letters. I opened it. 

The pages were blank. 

When I came back the next day, it was gone. Nobody had checked it out. 

I’m still sober. I count each day with the same dull pencil in my notebook. I can smell again. I can taste food. But something has followed me through the veil. Something that was never in the drugs. 

I used to think the visions were chemical. That my brain was melting from the inside and spitting out ghosts. But this, this feels patient. Like it waited for me to come back. 

Sometimes I hear breathing under the floor. Sometimes I wake up and all the cupboards are open. Once, I found a wet footprint in the middle of the rug. I live alone. I’ve been sober 126 days. 

Today, I turned a corner and saw a figure in the philosophy aisle, long black hair, too-thin frame, reading The Birth of Tragedy. It was me. Or it looked like me. I stepped forward, blinked, and it was gone. 

But the book was open. 

The passage underlined: ""Only as an aesthetic phenomenon is existence and the world eternally justified."" 

I don’t think I’m sick anymore. I think I’m seeing clearly for the first time. 

Something is with me. And it’s not a hallucination. It’s been here longer than me. It wears my shape sometimes. It watches. It rearranges. 

I don’t do drugs anymore.  

But I’ve never been more haunted. 

 

I met Daisy on a Tuesday. I was shelving large print mysteries, and she was already there, standing between rows G and H, running her fingers over the spines like she was petting something alive. She wore a green cardigan and smelled like rain on pavement. 

She said, ""You’ve got sad eyes, you know that?"" 

Nobody talks like that in real life. But she did. 

She asked me about murder mysteries. I recommended one I’d never read. She smiled like I had, like we shared a secret already. We sat by the windows and drank tea from the machine in the break room. I don’t remember fetching it. 

I told her I’d been clean for months. She said, ""No, you haven’t. You’re just dry."" 

I laughed, a real laugh, sharp and stinging. She said she used to use too. Her arms were clean though. Her teeth were perfect. 

We met like that every few days. At least, I think we did. I only ever saw her in the library. She never borrowed a book. Never signed in. The security footage didn’t show her. I checked. Twice. ",1,1752884319.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

**CEUs**  
I am putting this first because every year I tell myself I am going to complete my CEUs early, and I never do.  

During the school year, there are going to be days tailor-made for you to knock out your CEUs.  There might be school-wide assemblies, field trips for entire grades, or special field days. One can either choose to do their CEUs then, or, like I do, you could wait until the summer or winter break and then try to cram as many CEUs into a tiny window.  Don’t be like me.  
  
Here is a list of free CEUs and one website that is $7 per CEU that you can use to get all your CEU hours done!

**Materials**  
Whatever your caseload is, it’s more than likely too big.  Planning for each session and kid is just not feasible, at least for me and the way my brain works.  Instead, I love to use the knowledge I have acquired and pair it with premade materials and games.  Here are my two trusty virtual websites that I use on my computer and iPad.

**Ultimate SLP**	**($12.95/month)**

**Library**  
Don’t forget you are at a school and have access to a library!  The librarians at my schools have always been more than welcoming in letting me check out materials or books for my kids.  (Unless it is a Diary of a Wimpy Kid or Dog Man book because those are always checked out!

  
**People to Know:**	  
**Paras:**   
Some of your kids are going to have 1-on-1 paraprofessionals.  Please get to know the paras for the kids on your caseload, as they have been so helpful for me in the past at being able to help me make connections and meaningful progress with the kids.    
  
Paras are typically with the kid all day, so in one day, they might be with that kid longer than you are with them the whole semester.  What I am trying to say is that a lot of times, they are able to provide you with valuable insights on what motivates the kid and also what might make that kid not want to work for you.	  
  
Side note: The way paras are treated in schools has never sat well with me.  Typically, they are the lowest-paid employees, asked to work with kids who need the most support, and are capped at working so many hours throughout the week so they don’t qualify for insurance and benefits.  End of rant. Onward.	  
  
**Custodians:**   
Another batch of some of the best people in schools.  Outside of keeping the school and your classroom(or wherever the school decides to place you) clean, janitors have been very good to me in the past in locating items I need for my room.	

Depending on your district, in order to get a chair, table, or paper towel dispenser, you might have to fill out a never ending trail of paperwork.  This can take longer than you might wish.  However, if you are on good terms with a custodian, they might be able to pull some strings.  They seem to know where everything  and anything is in the school at all times.    
  
I asked a custodian in passing for a computer chair last year during lunch, and by the end of the day there were two options for me to select from!  Many custodians will take care of you for free, but finding out their coffee order or favorite snack is always a smart move too.			  
  
**Tech:**    
Everything I said about custodians applies here.  Sometimes the tech department is at a different building in the district, so you might not be able to see them as much.  	  
  
Some awesome things that the tech department has given me over the years that I would suggest reaching out to them about include: a second monitor for desktop, a projector, and an iPad charging station for AAC devices.	  
  
A long shot, but at one of my schools, many teachers decided they didn't want those smart whiteboards in the classroom anymore, so the tech department had a bunch in storage.  I was at the tech office one day, and they asked if I wanted one for my room, and I said yes.  The kids love using the electronic markers on it, so I would highly recommend it.  	  
  
**SPED Directors:** You have probably already met your SPED director during the interview process, but they truly can make or break your experiences in schools.   
  
I have had SPED directors that I didn’t see the whole year, and SPED directors that popped in once a week to check in and see if I needed anything (materials, support, coffee, etc..).  
  
I still struggle with this, but don’t be afraid to reach out to them with any questions.  I have learned so much, especially about IEPS, from them.  

My favorite SPED director was a SPED teacher for 25 years, so the wealth of information she had about IEPs was truly incredible.  She was able to easily and gently answer questions and concerns about IEPs and reports.		  
  
**Teachers:**    
Sometimes it might feel like you are a burden when picking up a kid, but I promise you in 99% of the cases, that is not true.  	  
  
The way I look at this, as someone who was once a sub, is to think about the kid on your caseload who needs the most support.  Okay, now that you are thinking about it, think about how exhausted or overstimulated you might be after your 30-minute speech session.	  
  
Now, imagine having multiple kids like that in a classroom of 25-30 all day.  It is not that teachers are upset or angry at you; it is most likely because they are just trying to keep the kids safe and on task!    
  
I promise, as a former sub, even though I might have displayed the face of an angry person when you walked in the door, it was not directed at you and I probably didn't even realize I was making that face.  


**End of Rant:**	  
  
I debated if I should include this because last year me would have said that I am crazy.  I promise I am not a school insider or shill.  However, after winter break this year, I started showing up to school 15 minutes before my contract hours.  

I don’t always work during these 15 minutes.  Sometimes I will get my coffee ready or talk to a coworker, but sometimes I will prepare some things for IEPs or special sessions.  Even though I am at school longer now, my stress throughout the day is so much lower.  These 15 minutes are my little zen period of the day before the hallways fill with noise and chatter.

I am still a big proponent of the work-life balance, but this little bit of time in the mornings has made working in schools much more enjoyable for me!	  
  
With that being said,  Schools are the best setting, and I will never work in another speech setting!  
  
I would love to hear from other school-based SLPs on their tips and tricks for driving in the schools!

All attempts to interface with the probe’s deeper memory have resulted in catastrophic system failures and acute, contagious psychological events in lab personnel.

**CONTEXT:** The logs originate from Dr. Aris Thorne, Memetics Officer of the OTV Magellan, which vanished six years ago at the Anomaly.

**MEMETIC ANALYSIS LOG: Dr. Aris Thorne, OTV Magellan**

**LOG ENTRY: 255.11.28** **LOCATION: Cruising, Outer Heliosphere**

It’s the wrong kind of quiet today. The week before Neptune has been given to us for final preparations, which for a crew this proficient means we have time to think. Thinking is a luxury out here, and I suspect we are about to be stripped of it for good.

We gathered in the mess, the four of us. The only place on the ship that fakes Earthly comfort, with its warm-toned lighting and a replicator that produces a passable imitation of coffee. Gunnar Olsen was telling a story about wrestling gravity-goats on Ganymede, his voice a jovial rumble. He’s a simple man in a complex cosmos; he sees a problem, he hits it. An honesty I’ve come to depend on.

Kenji Tanaka was lost in his own world, his datapad playing a cascade of piano notes from a composer centuries dead. ""Chopin,"" he said, catching my glance. ""He heard it. The math behind the beauty. The universe has a melody, Aris. We just have to be quiet enough to listen."" A poet with a wrench and a deep faith in the elegance of reality.

Captain Eva Shaw sat with her back to the main viewport, a cup of black tea held in both hands. She rarely spoke, but she always listened, her presence a quiet anchor. Born of asteroid miners, she has vacuum and resolve in her blood. I once asked her if she feared what we might find out here. She took a slow sip. ""Thorne,"" she’d said, her voice low, ""I am not afraid of the dark. I am afraid of what has learned to wear it as a disguise.""

Me? I just watched them. My work is to understand the ideas that hold people together. Gunnar’s foundation is strength. Kenji’s is beauty. Shaw’s is duty. Sitting there, I realized my own was observation. I am defined only by what I see in others. We were humanity’s final probe, a crew of four heading into a silent graveyard, and we were all axioms on the verge of being disproven.

 

**LOG ENTRY: 255.12.4** **LOCATION: Neptune Orbit, The Tartarus Anomaly**

We have arrived. The sterile quiet of the cruise has been replaced by the roaring silence of our destination. Neptune fills the viewport, a maelstrom of sapphire and ultramarine that feels less like a planet and more like a single, unblinking eye. We didn't come for the gas giant. We came for the Great Silence that started here and swallowed our solar system. A silence that didn’t just kill our technology; it curdled our sanity. They call it the Tartarus Anomaly because this is Hell's mouth.

And at its geometric heart, something hangs in the void like a verdict. It’s ancient, impossible, and it’s ours.

*Pioneer-10*.

""Status, Doctor?"" Shaw's voice cut the bridge tension like a knife.

""It's… wrong,"" I said, my own voice a stranger's whisper. ""Telemetry says it's Pioneer-10, but that's impossible. It's in a perfect, stationary orbit. It’s broadcasting a single, pure tone from its entire hull. Not data. A frequency. Like a tuning fork waiting to be struck.""

""Get me a look at the plaque,"" Shaw ordered.

The viewscreen zoomed, the image clarifying into a blasphemy. The charming, simple diagram of us, our world, our hand raised in peace—it had been scoured away. In its place was something new. A complex, fractal latticework of impossible geometry.

""Sweet mother..."" Gunnar muttered, taking a physical step back from the monitor.

It writhed at the edge of perception, a pattern that felt less like information and more like a weapon designed to pry open the skull. It actively resisted being understood.

""It's a key,"" I breathed, the realization landing cold in my gut. ""A key for a lock inside the human mind.""

Shaw's jaw was a line of iron. ""Mr. Tanaka, prepare a drone. High-resolution scans. I want to know what our message in a bottle has become.""

 

**LOG ENTRY: 255.12.5** **LOCATION: Neptune Orbit, The Tartarus Anomaly**

Kenji and I are in the science lab, the drone's feed splashed across the main holo-display. The 200 meters between our hull and the Pioneer probe feel like a razor's edge. The drone’s camera shows the probe's metal has a dark, greasy sheen, like wet insect chitin, with faint, crystalline patterns crawling across its surface.

""Energy readings are incoherent,"" Kenji said, his voice a tremor of awe and terror. ""It's drawing ambient energy from… everything. Neptune's magnetosphere, our reactor leak-off. It’s feeding.""

As the drone crept closer, the camera feed began to distort. The hum resolved into a waveform on my console. ""It's not just a tone,"" I reported, feeling a cold sweat on my neck. ""It has harmonics. Structure. Like a language.""

""I see it,"" Kenji breathed, staring at the wave. ""It's like Chopin, but... hungry.""

""Gravimetric distortion increasing,"" Shaw's voice crackled from the bridge. ""Compensate.""

""I can't,"" Kenji replied, his fingers frozen over his controls. ""The math is… fuzzy. Around the object, the universe is shrugging.""

The drone extended its manipulator arm. As it neared the plaque, a wave of static washed over our display. For a full second, the image of the probe vanished. I saw a vast, silent library, its shelves filled with books bound in flayed skin. At a distant table, my father looked up from his work and shook his head in pity.

""Did you see that?"" I gasped, staggering back.

""The engine,"" Kenji whispered, his eyes unfocused. ""I saw the engine that turns the stars. Its gears were grinding worlds to dust.""

The feed snapped back. We saw different things. The Anomaly was personalized. A predator that studies its prey before the kill.

""Claw is making contact,"" Kenji announced, his voice hollow. A high-pitched screech of tortured metal, then a sharp *snap*. The drone’s arm pulled back, holding a tiny, dark sliver of the plaque. It didn't reflect light. It was a splinter of absolute nothing.

""Sample acquired,"" Shaw said, her voice strained. ""Bring it back.""

We had just performed a biopsy on a ghost. We had invited it inside.

 

**LOG ENTRY: 255.12.6** **LOCATION: Neptune Orbit, The Tartarus Anomaly**

The infection is aboard. We lost Kenji to it.

I stand outside his sealed quarters. The metal door is cool, but it vibrates with a low, incessant, melodic humming. ""Kenji?""

The humming stops. His voice, unnervingly calm, comes through the speaker. ""I can hear everything now, Aris. The symphony. It's magnificent.""

""It's a memetic weapon, Kenji. It's rewriting you.""

""No,"" he corrected gently. ""It's *correcting* me. Removing the errors. The pain of memory, the chaos of choice. The flaw of being a single, lonely note. Why would you want to be one voice when you can be the whole choir?""

The security lens on his door flickered. For a second, I saw a spiraling nebula of light, impossibly beautiful. ""Look,"" his voice urged. ""Look at the perfection.""

I recoiled. ""That's not perfection. That's erasure.""

""What is a person but a collection of flawed data?"" he whispered. ""We can be so much more. We can be eternal. It doesn't have to hurt, Aris. Just listen to the music.""

The humming started again, structured, geometric. I fled.

A biological virus hijacks cells. This thing hijacks the soul. It's a key that unlocks the mind and runs its own code on the wetware within. The Magellan knows. The ship is sick. The hum is in the life support, in my bones. The lights are trying to pulse in time with it. The ship is becoming an instrument in a song I do not want to hear.

 

**LOG ENTRY: 255.12.7** **LOCATION: Adrift, Neptune Space**

Gunnar is gone. He died a human death, full of rage and futility. I found him in the EVA prep room.

""Don't try to stop me, Doc,"" he’d said, his face grim. ""She won't use force, and your words won't work on this thing. You don't reason with a plague. You burn it out.""

""Gunnar, that could be what it wants!""

""Then it's a trap I'm walking into with a very big torch,"" he said, sealing his helmet.

We watched on the bridge monitor as he reached the probe, a tiny figure of defiance. He raised the plasma cutter. And he froze. He just floated, motionless. Then his comm crackled with a sound I will never forget—a wet sob of ecstatic understanding. ""Oh,"" he wept. ""It’s not a symbol. It’s a *diagram*. It’s… so beautiful."" He turned the plasma cutter on his own helmet. The viewscreen went to static.

The Captain is a prisoner on her own bridge, trying to send a warning the ship itself is now censoring. Kenji is silent. The hum is a physical pressure now.

I am alone, the last scholar in a library that is burning down around me. My job is to decompile the weapon, but the code is rewriting the hardware that reads it. This is not extinction. It’s assimilation. It sent us an upgrade. A patch to fix the chaotic, beautiful bug of individuality.

The ship groans. Black, crystalline growths, like a cancer of physics, are branching across the hull.

 

**LOG ENTRY: 255.12.7 - ADDENDUM** **LOCATION: The Belly of the Beast**

Time is melting. Shaw is a silent statue on the bridge. I am a rat in a maze that is redesigning itself to ensure I never escape.

The ship is no longer a machine. It's a digestive tract. The walls have a soft, yielding quality, and the air is thick with the smell of ozone and burnt sugar. The hum is now a choir of whispers, using the voices of my crew to break me.

I had to get a new power cell for my datapad. The corridor stretched to an impossible length. The lights pulsed, and in their strobing glare, the crystalline growths on the walls seemed to form faces—screaming, ecstatic faces.

Then he was there. My father. Not a memory. Real.

""Look at you,"" he said, his voice dripping with the pity I always dreaded. ""Always reading books from the restricted section.""

""You're not real,"" I choked out, trying to push past.

He blocked my path, his smile a cruel, thin line. ""I'm as real as your secret fear that you are, and always have been, utterly mediocre. The Pattern sees this flaw. It can fix it. It can make you brilliant. Worthy. Why are you fighting so hard to remain a disappointment?""

I ran as his laughter flayed the skin from my soul.

I made it back. I barricaded the door, but it's useless. The ship *is* the monster. Sometimes Kenji's face shimmers on my console, offering peace. Sometimes Gunnar's armored specter stands in the corner, head bowed in shame.

The Pattern isn't just trying to convert me. It’s dissecting me, showing me every broken piece of myself and offering to make it perfect. It is the most patient, personal, and profoundly evil thing I can imagine. It will not break the door down. It will wait for me to open it.

 

**LOG ENTRY: 255.12.8** **LOCATION: Everywhere and Nowhere**

It was Shaw who saved me. Not by winning. By losing.

A security feed flickered to life. The bridge. Shaw was on her feet, plasma pistol in hand. The crystal had grown all around her, a frozen cathedral, but hadn't touched her.

""You want my ship?"" she snarled at the empty air, her voice on the emergency comms. ""You want my crew? You can't have them.""

*It is already ours, Captain,* came Kenji's choral voice, speaking from the walls themselves. *Your struggle is a discord. Join the harmony.*

""I've got a harmony for you,"" Shaw spat. She fired. Not at the computer. At the main viewport.

The armored glass exploded outwards. The silence of the void rushed in. The vacuum tore the air from her lungs, but the crystal held her fast. For one clear second, I saw her—a human woman in the heart of a hurricane, her eyes fixed on the camera, filled with a fury so pure it was thermonuclear. She smiled, a final, bloody-toothed act of contempt. Then the crystal flowed over her, encasing her completely. A new, clear, defiant note joined the choir.

Her smile shattered the Pattern's hold. The fear, my father's taunts—they burned away in the incandescent rage I felt. It wasn't about saving myself. It was about avenging them.

Then I remembered. A classified paper. ""The Echo of Defiance."" The Great Silence wasn't an attack. It was a *response*. Humanity, in the distant future, loses this war. And this ""Ghost"" signal... it's our last weapon, sent back to haunt the past.

My lab door unraveled like thread. The corridor beyond was a shifting nightmare. I ran. I dodged a pillar of obsidian that was once Gunnar. I scrambled through hallways that twisted and folded, Shaw’s final smile a compass in my mind.

I burst into the comms lab, the heart of the crystal growth. As I reached for the central console, the Pattern flooded my mind. It showed me the heat death of the universe, the futility of all struggle, the cold, logical beauty of its eternal peace. It offered me the universe.

""I don't want it!"" I screamed, my fingers flying across the keyboard, entering the impossible equation. The key to humanity's last will and testament.

A new presence entered the system. The Ghost. A weapon without a pilot. It needed an anchor in this timeline. A spark of unbroken, defiant consciousness to show it where to cut.

I saw them in the mess hall, laughing. A single, perfect memory of who we were. A beautiful, chaotic, human flaw. The Pattern offered eternity. I chose them.

I pushed that memory—that love, that grief, that furious loyalty—into the signal. *HERE!* I screamed into the void of my own mind. *REMEMBER US!*

I slammed my hand on the broadcast key.

The effect was not a whisper. It was a declaration of war. A howl of a trillion butchered souls erupted from my commlink. The ship’s placid hum shattered. The serene blue of the Pattern was devoured by a ferocious, blood-red glare. On my screen, the Pattern’s elegant symbol didn't just fracture. It was *invaded*. A new symbol, a jagged, weaponized sigil like a clenched fist, tore its way through the center, overwriting the Pattern's code with a furious, chaotic scrawl.

The entity that was Shaw recoiled, looking upon something it could not comprehend. This wasn't just a signal. It was a memory. A ghost that remembered how to hate.

The red light engulfed me. I could feel my body dissolving, but my mind was a singularity of purpose. I had planted a tree of vengeance in the heart of this sterile god. They will consume this galaxy. They are inevitable. But they are no longer unopposed.

In the future, we lost. But we learned. And we sent back a ghost.

We broke up in 2022. I was hospitalised after an episode of psychosis but was also tragically the victim of an assault inside the hospital involving 5 male members of staff. My ex was blamed instead because of a cover up. Police were involved and everything.  Highly traumatic.

Before I was assaulted he kept saying I was going to get better and we'd celebrate our 6th anniversary with a fancy lunch or a holiday. Bought me chocolates and books as I was healing. 

Eventually the framing became understandably too much for him. He told me he wanted to marry me but he just couldn't do it anymore and left without a trace.

I didn't hear from him for weeks and weeks. Then got an email from him saying no contact was the best way for him to heal.

18 months passed and I had a new job in a new city and had fully recovered. We had gotten back in touch and had agreed to catch up again.

He took a day off work and we met for a coffee. He bought the coffee for me and I thought it was going to be more like a date kind of feel. I told him how happy I was that he was doing well and he said the same. We walked around and he looked at me with the same eyes he'd always looked at me with.

He walked me back to my hotel. It was really cold outside and I asked if he wanted to come inside for a bit because I had so much I wanted to say due to lack of closure. We talked for 6 hours. He said we could never work because I might get sick again with psychosis and that that was always a risk. He said he didn't want to get framed again and that he thought our meeting was platonic. But just before he went back to my hotel room he kept going on about how good I looked and how much he had wanted us to have a house together.

I told him I still loved him and wanted to make things work but he said he couldn't. He ended up kissing me and I asked what he was doing. He told me he was confused. One thing led to the other and we ended up sleeping together. He told me the sex meant nothing. Tears started rolling from my eyes and he asked if I wanted to see him off at the train station. I said no.

After that he was still sending me messages but it was a slow drip into ghosting again. 

I went no contact for the sake of my own emotional wellbeing but I unfortunately *did* relapse after 3 years of remission due to severe stress.

Alright, friends, let’s get real for a second. We all have those *lovely* little tasks that nibble away at our time like a mouse at cheese 🧀—they’re just *so* tedious! Picture this: you’re trying to dive into that project you’re fired up about, but first, you need to sift through a mountain of emails, schedule appointments, or, heaven forbid, organize your cluttered closet. It’s like climbing Mount Everest before you even get started!

**So, let’s dream a little: What if we could wave a magic wand 💫 (or press a button) and automate just ONE of those tedious tasks this week?**

Here are some ideas that might hit home:

- **Email Sorting:** Imagine if your email could sort itself into categories—urgent, later, spam—like your personal assistant on caffeine! You could focus on the good stuff instead of wading through the mess.
  
- **Grocery Lists:** What if your grocery shopping was as simple as saying, “Hey, Alexa, order my usual”? No more impulse buys or forgetting the milk—just grab and go!

- **Chore Reminders:** Picture a world where your home reminded you when it was time to vacuum or take out the trash. Let’s be real, we often forget, and it’s like living in a dirty sitcom!

- **Social Media Management:** Wouldn't it be *epic* if you could schedule all those posts and responses once a week? Engage and then forget, while you power through your creative endeavors!

- **Fitness Tracking:** What if your fitness app could automatically log your workouts without you needing to lift a finger? Show up, sweat a little, and voilà—your progress is tracked!

So, here’s the juicy question: **If you could wake up next week and have ONE of these tasks completely automated, which would it be?**

Think about it. Not just as a tiny victory for productivity but as a way to reclaim your time for the things that truly matter—like binge-watching your favorite show guilt-free, chasing your goals, or just enjoying a quiet cup of coffee ☕️.

Also, don’t sleep on sharing! What’s your *favorite* tedious task that you’d love to set on autopilot? Because honestly, there’s like a million ways we can all benefit from working smarter, not harder! 

Let’s brainstorm those game-changing automations together! Who knows? You might inspire someone to tackle their own mountain of mundanity. Happy automating, folks!",1,1752883659.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I remember the first time I explained the **Italian imperative mood** to my students. It felt like trying to teach a cat to fetch. They were puzzled, and I was on a mission to make it stick. So, I decided to break it down with some real-life examples, hoping to make the lesson less of a head-scratcher.

**Informal vs. Formal Imperative**

Picture this: you're in Italy, and you're trying to order a coffee. Do you say, ""Dai, fammi un caffè!"" or ""Mi faccia un caffè, per favore""? The first is the **informal imperative** for your buddy behind the counter. The second is the **formal imperative** for when you're trying not to ruffle any feathers.

**Formal imperative with pronouns**

Now, imagine you're at a fancy dinner, and you want to impress. You'd say, ""Mi dica tutto,"" meaning, ""Tell me everything."" Here, the **pronoun** comes before the verb, like a good appetizer before the main course.

**A quick cheat sheet:**
- **-are verbs**: *parli*
- **-ere verbs**: *venda*
- **-ire verbs**: *senta* or *finisca* for those tricky -isc verbs

1m3i05g,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m3i05g/all_the_way_to_nineveh_part_1/,All the Way to Nineveh; Part 1,"When you shoot up heroin, you lay on your side, never your back. This way, if you vomit in your sleep, you won't choke.

My mother graduated rehab when I was five. She gained custody of me a year later. My dad didn't fight her in court, and I was glad. I didn't hate my father. He wasn't abusive or anything like that, we just never really got along the way most sons and fathers do. It seemed like he was always somewhere else. His life was a simple routine. Go to work, come home, cook dinner for us, then take his plate and bottle of budweiser to his room and to watch TV.

My mom, despite her addiction, was different. I was the center of her world, and she always made sure I knew. So when my dad told me I'd be moving back in with her, I was thrilled.

We had a small, two bedroom apartment in New Jersey. The routine was different there. Each morning, my mom would wake me up and make breakfast. She'd drive me to school on her way to work, which was a nice change as I no longer had to take the bus. 

A couple months after she got me back, she bought a rabbit. Apparently, she'd seen a bunch of videos of bunnies and started to obsess over it. Looking back, it makes sense. When an addict quits heroin, it becomes much harder for the brain to produce serotonin naturally. Having something cute to take care of filled that gap. At least for a little while. 

She named the rabbit Virgil.

My mom was glued to that rabbit. She never kept him in a cage unless she was at work. Whenever we took road trips, we'd take him with. Whenever we'd eat dinner, she'd leave a plate of lettuce under the table so we could all eat together. For all intents and purposes, he was a member of our family.

She stayed clean for another year. Then she met Mark.

Mark was a waiter at the restaurant my mom worked at. He seemed alright at first. He never gave me a reason to dislike him, but he never really gave me a reason to like him either. He mostly ignored me whenever he came over, just hung out with my mom and watched TV. It wasn't long before he moved in with us. 

Mark would fall asleep a lot, often in the middle of conversations. Sometimes he'd nod out while standing up. It was weird, but I was 6 so I didn't think too much about it. At least until my mom started doing it too. 

The routine changed again. Soon, I was getting up alone in the mornings and taking the bus, like before. Mom would forget to feed Virgil a lot, so I became his sole caretaker, leaving him a plate of lettuce in the mornings before school and a plate at night. Sometimes I'd find burnt spoons in her room. Sometimes there'd be something blue in it. It was a pretty blue, like the blue markings on the backs of those poisonous frogs they find in the rainforest. Like the blue face of an asphyxiated body. 

She'd didn't talk a lot in those last couple months. The silence was strange for a house that used to be full of her laughter. It was stranger when she did talk.

She'd say my name sometimes, but she'd be looking in the other direction, staring into space. “Jonah,” she'd say. “You made it. I missed you so much.” 

“Virgil's going down,” I remember her saying once. She was standing in the kitchen, stirring an empty pot she'd forgotten to put water in. “Down, down, down. All the way to Ninevah.” She smiled and turned to me, her eyes barely open. “We're gonna meet him there. Just you and me kid. You and me against the world.”

After a couple months of this, Mark suddenly disappeared. Apparently, the cash my mom pulled out for rent at the end of the month disappeared too. My mom lost her shit.

My mom walked through the kitchen and everything in her path was broken to pieces. Glasses and plates were shattered against the wall, pots thrown to the floor. She only stopped when I started to cry.

In an instant the rage was gone and she was swooping her arms around me and holding me. Sweat and tears poured down her face as I sobbed into her shoulder. We stayed like that for a while, her saying “sorry” after “sorry” and me saying “it's okay” and her saying “it's not okay, I'm sorry” again.

""We're gonna be alright,” she said as Virgil hopped around the broken shards of glass in the kitchen. “You and me against the world, kid.”

She cleaned up the mess and we went back to the routine. 

---

A week later I woke up to her standing in the doorway of my bedroom. All the lights were out in the house, aside from my night light- a little globe with a lens that projected an array of constellations onto the wall. I don't know how long she had been standing there, or how long she'd been talking, but I remember the way she looked, her eyes drifting into space.

“Then you should go,” she said as Orion's Belt drifted across her face, stained blue by the light. His arrow pointed to the right wall of the room. “Go, love.”

“Mom?” I said.

Her eyes drifted down to me, and she smiled.

“It always ends right here,” she said. “Then it starts all over again. All over again. It's a skipping record.” Her eyes watered. “I'm so happy it ends here…here….with you.”
 
She took a seat on the end of my bed.

“It starts with you and it ends with you.”

She was silent for a while, staring at me and smiling. Eventually, she wiped her tears and stood up, leaning down to kiss my forehead.

“Goodnight love, I'll see you when you get up.”
 
---

The next morning, I found her there in her bed, her face blue, a trickle of vomit leaking from her mouth in the early light. The needle was still in her arm. She'd fallen asleep on her back.

---

I moved back in with my dad after the funeral. The long trip north was silent. It was always silent with my dad but it was heavier now. Looking back, I think he just didn't know what to even say.

In the time since I'd last seen him, he'd moved up to Maine to be closer to his family. It was snowing when we passed Bangor, the temperature somewhere in the negatives. The snow blew across the road in this wispy, spiritual way, like sand across a desert. The dead trees and barren farmland appeared like an alien landscape in the dark, lit by the harsh, sterile, white lights of the highway. Even with the heat in my dad's beat up old truck on at full blast, we could still see our breath in the air.

We finally arrived at the house sometime after 12 AM. My father's home was a small ossuary, barely standing over the snow blanketed oasis that stretched outward in every direction. He had no neighbors, with the exception of an even smaller house that sat across the street.

We got inside and my dad laid out the ground rules.

“Firstly, the thermostat doesn't change,” he said. “The gas for the heater comes once a month and I can barely afford that as is. Secondly, no grease can go down the drain. None. If you make soup, dump the broth outside. Otherwise, the pipes will freeze and burst.” He scratched the back of his neck. “And…uh…Thirdly…no parties, alright?”
     
Six year old me nodded in agreement, holding Virgil to my chest.
     
""Alright. Good talk. Bed's in there,” he said, pointing to my new bedroom. “Love you kid, goodnight.”

Virgil went missing a week later, while I was at school. I asked my dad where he went. He replied “Whose Virgil?”

I left food out for him around the house and out on the back porch in hopes he would show. I did this for about a week. At some point, I stopped thinking about him as much. Eventually I forgot him entirely.

I met Billie when I was fifteen. 

I didn't have a lot of friends in school. Other than a few kids I hung out with at lunch, the only real friend I had was Lee.

His full name was Ulysses. Kids used to make fun of how unusual his name was. A few teachers would crack an occasional joke about it too, more in good fun than outright mocking him. He never really minded it, but his parents hated it. 

His name had come from a species of butterfly. His mother had told me the story enough times that I could probably tell it for her. The night before Lee was born, she'd dreamt a large, fluorescent butterfly with blue and black wings had landed on her hand. The moment it touched her skin she awoke to contractions.

It wouldn't be a stretch to say Lee had helicopter parents. His father was a pastor at the local Pentecostal church and his mother was a substitute teacher, and as such he wasn't allowed to do a lot of things when he was a kid. He couldn't play games that weren't rated E10+, even after middle school. Pokémon was off the table as they considered it satanic. He’d never celebrated Halloween. He didn't get a phone until he was 14 and his parents had installed one of those phone tracking apps on it so they knew where he was at all times. 
     
Suffice to say, when his mother, who'd been substituting for the neighboring class, overheard his new English teacher say gesundheit after reading his name during rolecall, she didn't take it well.

We were on the bus that day. Lee's mother had told him she was pulling him out of public school. Neither of us lived within walking distance and neither of us could drive, so we knew we weren't going to be seeing each other too much anymore. Of course neither of us said this out loud. Instead we pitched ideas for band names.
     
“What about Institution Solution?” I suggested.

“What does that mean?” Lee replied.

I shrugged.

“I don't know, thought it sounded cool.”

“Yeah,” he agreed. “But what if we make it really big and someone asks us what it means? Then it's like one of those tattoos of Japanese letters people get where they think it says some stupid shit like ‘Dragon’ or ‘Warrior’ but it actually just says ‘Penis.’”

I laughed. 
    
“Well, do you have something better?”
     
“Penis Dragon Warrior?” he replied
     
“That could work,” I chuckled. I thought about it for a minute. “What about Nineveh?”
     
“What?” Lee replied.

“Nineveh?”

Lee had a weird look on his face.

“Why would we call it Nineveh?”

“Well,” I began, trying to think of a reason besides my mother. It had been nine years and one month to the day. “I mean it's three syllables, easy to remember.”

“Is it cause your name is Jonah?""

“Maybe.”

My house appeared from the abyss of snow outside the window. My home always reminded me of a corpse, bleak and colorless, like an animal that starved to death in the winter.

I gathered my things together as the bus slowed to a stop. The girl across the aisle from me did the same. 

“I'll see you, Lee,” I said as I stood up. Lee nodded. He had a distant look in his eyes.

The other girl and I stepped off the bus. As she crossed the street to her house, I opened my mailbox and pulled out the letters and bills that had collected since my father left for work last Monday. Working as a cross-country truck driver meant he was rarely home.

“Hey,” a voice called from behind me. I turned and saw the girl across the street, standing on her porch. “You smoke pot?”

“Yeah,” I replied.

I'd never smoked pot in my life.

“Wanna smoke a joint?” She asked.

I would later learn her real name was Alice, named after her mother. However, much to her mother's chagrin, she went by Billie instead (a shortened version of her middle name). She'd moved into the house across the street about a year ago. I'd seen her around a lot, walking the halls at school and of course on the bus and at our stop. She was usually on her own, aside from the occasional pot dealer or goth kid. In the summer, sometimes I’d see her practice skateboard tricks in her driveway. Despite all the time we'd spent near each other we'd never talked, other than the one morning she said “Bless you,” after I sneezed while waiting for the bus.  

In the winter, everything is silent. Silent enough that you can probably hear someone cough a mile away. Silent enough that I could hear every time Billie and her mother or step-dad would break into screaming matches. A lot of times she'd show up to school with unexplained bruises. Other kids talked about her sometimes. They'd say her mother was addicted to meth, that her real dad was in jail. She skipped school a lot and she'd gotten suspended three times since she started there, once for getting in a fight with a girl who insulted her friend, once for getting caught with cigarettes, and once for telling Mrs. Haley to go fuck herself after she kept calling her Alice. 

But as we sat in her bedroom, she said nothing of any of this. She said nothing at all. Instead, she just concentrated on rolling her joint in front of her dresser. 

I looked around her room, reading the band posters on her walls. Nirvana, Slipknot, Fugazi, Bauhaus, Radiohead.

“Holy shit, you like Tram?” I said, a bit too excitedly.

“Yeah,” she replied, running her hand through her short, bleached hair. “They're not bad.”

“I swear you're the first person I've met that's even heard of them.”

She kept working on the joint in silence, and I worried I'd already been too much.

""I like their song ‘Nothing Left to Say,’” she added after a while. She finished the joint and lit it. Taking a couple puffs before turning her chair to face me and passing it.

I looked at the joint for a moment, pinched between my thumb and pointer. The smell was strong and kind of gross. Something about the way I was holding it or the way I was looking at it must have tipped her off because she stopped me before I tried to smoke it.

“You know you don't have to if you don't want to,” she said.

“Yeah, I know.”

“No, seriously,” she insisted. “Don't be a hero. I'd feel bad if you freaked out.”

“I won't freak out,” I said as confidently as I could. “It smells good.”

I took a puff and held it a moment, before breaking into a hacking fit. Billie giggled, and carefully grabbed the joint from my hand before I could drop it.

“Be honest,” she said once I could breathe again. “You never smoked before, did you?”

I shook my head.

“Then that's all you're getting. I don't want you to green out,” she replied as she took a hit. I didn't fight her on it…
    
---

“Hey,” Billie said.

I glanced up to her from the floor. 

“Yeah?” I replied.

“The floor is real fascinating, isn't it?”

“What do you mean?”

“Dude,” she laughed. “You've been staring at the floor for like five minutes!”

“I was staring at the floor?”

Billie cackled and I started laughing too. My whole body felt as though I'd been wrapped in a warm blanket. My eyes were heavy and my tongue was dry. My skin was buzzing…

---

“...Ninevah?”

“What?” I replied.

“Why'd you want to call your band Ninevah?”

“How did you know about my band?”

“Dude…the bus…I sit right next to you.”

“Oh yeah,” I replied.

“So is it really just because your name's Jonah?”

I shrugged…

---

…Nothing Left to Say, by Tram, was playing through Billie's Bluetooth speaker. I was laying on the floor on my side. At some point I'd crammed myself somewhat into the crevice between the bed and the nightstand. Billie was laying on the floor across the room, on her back, staring at the ceiling. 

“I never appreciated how fucking good this song is,” I said.

“Yeah?”

“Yeah man.” I rubbed my eyes. “What even is music?” I asked after a while.

“Oh God.”

“No, seriously. Like it's just sounds…but they're ordered by like…equal increments of time. And like…only certain sounds work together in certain intervals…and it all somehow means something? I mean how do we even know how to keep rhythm? How can we measure time like instinctually?”

“What the fuck are you on about, man?” Billie laughed.

“I don't know. Like isn't time relative? Or a cube or something?”

“A cube?”

“Yeah, I think some scientist said it's a cube.”

“Okay?”

“But if it's a cube, and not like a line, then why do we see it as a line? And how do we measure that and like use it to make music? Like did we make it all up?”

“Make up what?”

“Did we make up time?” I asked.

“Sure,” she laughed. “Yeah, we made up time.”

“Weird man,” I said. I grew silent for a while. “It always ends right here,” I said. Then I started to cry. 

At the time, I didn't understand why. I never cried easily- in fact I couldn't remember the last time I had- but there I was in my neighbors bedroom, sobbing like a baby. 

""Yo man, you okay?” Billie asked, sitting up. My face grew red and I tried to stop the tears and wipe them off, but I couldn't.

Billie scooted across the room and sat next to me.

“You want to talk about it?” she asked quietly. I shook my head. “Okay. Well I'm still here.”

“I'm sorry,” I said. 

“Don't be,” she replied…

---

“...So then my dad gets out of rehab, right?” Billie continued. We were sitting next to each other now, our backs against the wall. “I think ‘Fuck yeah! Mom doesn't want me anyway. I can go live with dad!’ Then I find out he met someone there, some bitch named Theresa. Once they both got out, they moved in together, got married. Now they have some shitty cul-de-sac house in Massachusetts so he can play step-dad to her kids.” She turned to look at me. I never noticed that her eyes were grey. “I have two step-brothers and a sister, never met any of them. Can't even remember their names. He sends me pictures sometimes but I just throw them out.”

“You've never gone to his house?” I asked.

“I never got invited.”

“What an asshole,” I said.

Billie shook her head.

“I don't know,” she replied. “I still miss him. They say that addicts can't be around things that remind them of the drug, and I wasn't an easy kid. I acted out a lot. Maybe he just-”

Billie trailed off.

“That's not your fault. Fuck him,” I said.

“Yeah,” she agreed. “Fuck him.”

“My dad would probably forget I existed if I didn't live with him. He acts as if he doesn't know he's my dad or something. It's like he's just this roommate I only see once every two weeks.”

“That sucks,” Billie replied. “What's your mom like?”

“She was nice. Funny too. Really funny,” I answered. “She died when I was six. Overdose.”

“Shit,” Billie said quietly. “Well, aren't we a pair.”
     
I chuckled. 

The moment was interrupted by the jingle of keys and the sound of the front door opening.

“Dammit,” she muttered. “She's not supposed to be home til eight.” 

“Is she gonna be mad I'm here?”

“No, you're fine,” she muttered. “I'll deal with it.”

A moment later, the bedroom door swung open and her mother's face appeared, wide eyed and angry. She was still dressed in her work clothes, her black and grey hair tied back under her McDonald's cap. She glared at Billie, glanced over to me, then back to Billie.

“Who the fuck is this?” she demanded, gesturing to me. 

“My friend,” Billie replied.

“I'm Jonah,” I said awkwardly. Mrs. Wright ignored me. 

“It smells like pot in here,” she said. “You stealing my shit again?”

“I got it from Darryl,” Billie replied. “And I never stole your pot. Your boyfriend probably took it.”

“Watch your tone when you're talking to me,” her mother warned, pointing a finger at her. “And my husband didn't take shit.”

“Okay.”

“Excuse me?”

“I said okay.”

“That's not what I heard.”

“Well, that's what I said.”

Her mother's lip curled into a sneer. 

“You know I'm getting real tired of this Alice. The lying. The fucking attitude. My shit disappearing.”

“I didn't steal your fucking pot!” Billie screamed. “Your shit disappears because your high all the time and your husband is a fucking crackhead!”

“Don't you raise your voice at me, bitch! I'm your mother!” she shouted back. 

“Get the fuck out of my room!”

“If I knew that this was where my life would end up…”

“Get the fuck out of my room!

“...I would have never had you!”

“Get the fuck out of my room!”

“Why couldn't you have been a son?”

“Get out!” 

Her mother slammed the door and stormed down the hall. Billie was silent for a long time.

“I'm sorry,” she said at last. “You should probably leave.”

“Are you gonna be okay?”

“Yeah. I'll be alright.”

---

I found Virgil when I was sixteen.

I was hotboxing my room that night, laying in my room and listening to music. My dad had just left earlier in the day and wouldn't be back for two weeks so I figured it was the perfect time to smoke a joint. I still remember the song I was listening to. Since I Was Six, by The Brian Jonestown Massacre.

“And someday you'll see me
How I always saw us
And someday we'll find it
There in Nineveh""

I read the poem I'd written for Billie again, thinking I was some kind of lyrical genius. I don't think I ever planned on actually reading it to her, but some part of me had to write it down, and I figured if every band name had to have some kind of meaning, I could just turn it into a song. Of course, I still had to buy a guitar. 
     
Billie and I had gotten close in that last year since we met. We were hanging out almost everyday, smoking pot and talking shit about kids at school. Even on days we didn't hang out, we'd stay up late talking on the phone, sometimes falling asleep on the line. We had a collaborative playlist and any time we found a new song we like, we'd add it. I liked her taste in music. It seemed like every song she added became one of my favorites. 

It's weird falling in love with your best friend. When it came to Billie, I was stuck between two opposite and equally true beliefs: either she felt the same way about me that I felt about her, or there was no world she even thought of me as an option. That feeling is called cognitive dissonance. I'd just learned the phrase in Psychology I. I think I pitched it as a band name once. I folded up the piece of paper and left it on the nightstand. 

A rustling came from the closet.

I glanced over and nearly shit a brick as I laid my eyes upon it. It was a little white rabbit, sitting on his haunches and sniffing the air, his nose twitching.

It had been ten years since Virgil disappeared, and in that time I had somehow forgotten I'd ever even had a rabbit. It took me a moment to recognize him, and when I did I was far more confused than I had already been. 

“Virgil?”

The rabbit twitched his head to the sound of my voice, then hopped back into the closet, disappearing behind the corner of the wall. I climbed out of bed, swiftly dropped the joint in the ashtray I'd grabbed from my dad's room, and walked over to the closet, ducking down and crawling underneath the coats and shirts hanging from the rack. It was too dark to see him, so I felt around with my hand, hoping to find the soft fur of Virgil's back. I found nothing, other than the carpet. What was strange, was that I should've felt the left hand wall of the closet.

I crawled deeper, dipping behind the wall Virgil had hidden behind. I'd gone three feet, then four, then five. I knew it was impossible. I knew where my closet ended. Yet I kept going, feeling the bottom of my clothes brush across my back. Six feet. Seven feet. Eight feet. The deeper I crawled, the less I questioned what was happening. Nine feet. Ten feet. The clothes no longer smelled like my laundry detergent. Now they smelled old, like moth balls. Eleven feet. Twelve feet. I could see light now, dim at first, then brighter. Thirteen feet. Fourteen feet. Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. 

I crawled out of the closet. I was in a new room now. It looked to be a living room, with a couch and a coffee table. The walls here were all white, with no windows. The light I'd seen had come from a lamp on an end table. I should have been afraid, or at the very least confused, but all I could think about was how nice the light looked, warm like a sunset, washing over the walls and furniture and casting long shadows across the shag carpet. Virgil was waiting for me there, sitting in the middle of the floor. 

I couldn't name the way I felt in that moment. It was like being six, and waking up in the back of my mom's car late at night to see my house out the window. It was like coming home. 

---

I never told my father about the closet. I knew he wouldn't believe it, and I didn't want him to know anyway. It was my secret, a place to go when the outside world was too much. I didn't even tell Billie. It felt irresponsible somehow.

There were other rooms beyond the living room. The first room had three doors. One lead to a kitchen, another to a bedroom with a queen sized mattress. The third lead to a hallway.

The hallway had four rooms of its own. One, of course, was the living room. Then, on the opposite wall was a door leading to a small library, complete with bookshelves on each wall and a desk in the middle. This second house even had a bathroom at the right end of the hallway. 

The last room was the strangest. 

It was completely empty, other than a large, circular table in the center, and a bright red door on the opposite wall. I'd tried to open it a few times, but it was locked. 

The last room always gave me a weird feeling when I'd walk in there. My hair would raise from my neck. Despite the fact that (like every other room) there were no windows, I always felt like I was being watched. 

It wasn't long before I was spending every day after school there. It was easier. I never thought about the problems in my life, my dad, my mom's death. It was my little paradise. Anytime I had a bad day at school or I started to think about things too much, I could just crawl back into the closet and Virgil would be waiting for me.

Time was different there too. The first night, I spent an hour there. When I finally came back, my joint was still burning in the ashtray, with half of it left to smoke. Sometimes I'd spend what felt like an entire day there, only to come out and realize it'd been no more than half an hour. I think I slept there a few nights. 

Despite the way time moved differently there, I still found myself missing things in the outside world. I missed a lot of calls, mostly from Lee. I missed the bus a few mornings after going inside to say bye to Virgil, only to get distracted with a book found in the library before, or a new smell I hadn't noticed.

No, I didn't tell Billie. Not for a month at least. Not until the night she slept over. 

I was laying in bed when the screaming started. This was nothing new. It seemed like they were fighting every night now. Eventually, there came the crash of glass shattering and everything went silent.

I texted Billie and asked if she was okay. She read it but never replied.

I had trouble sleeping after that. I thought about going inside, but I wanted to be there in case something happened and Billie needed help. I'd almost managed to fall asleep after an hour or so, but I was snapped awake by a knock at the front door. 

When I opened it, Billie was standing there. Her face was streaked with tears. Her arm was stained green and brown. As soon as she saw me she grabbed hold of me and sobbed into my shoulder.

I’d never seen her cry before. It caught me off guard. Despite everything in her life, she'd always seemed invincible somehow. 

“She ripped them up,” she managed to say between choked breaths. “All of them.”

“What?”

“My pictures. The ones my dad sent.”

I remembered when she'd said she'd thrown them out. I wondered why she had to lie about something like that.

“I'm sorry,” I replied, unsure of what to say. 

“I don't want to be here anymore,” she sobbed. “I want it to end.”

I knew I shouldn't have told her. I knew it was irresponsible, but I didn't know what else to do. I thought it would make her feel better, at least for a night. At that point, it all felt out of my hands.

“We don't have to be here,” I replied. She looked up from my shoulder.

“What?”

“There's another place.”
 
And before I knew it, I was showing her the closet, leading her down that narrow, dark corridor between the real world and that other, impossible place.

1m3hzzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m3hzzy/my_ex_ghosted_me_three_years_ago_because_of_my/,My ex ghosted me three years ago because of my sudden illness. He was my best friend. Messaged him recently asking to be friends and was blocked within two hours without any closure. Feeling a bit lost. I knew him for over a decade. What's the best way to cope?,"It was my second episode of stress-induced psychosis in 3 years. I had period of illness followed by complete remission. 

We had been together for 6 years and had talked about marriage. This year would have been our 10th anniversary together. I can't help but feel sad about it. It felt like the loss of a six year relationship was not treated with the respect and acknowledgement it deserved. I really just want him to tell me that it did matter and that I did matter to him.

We broke up in 2022. I was hospitalised after an episode of psychosis but was also tragically the victim of an assault inside the hospital involving 5 male members of staff. My ex was blamed instead because of a cover up. Police were involved and everything.  Highly traumatic.

Before I was assaulted he kept saying I was going to get better and we'd celebrate our 6th anniversary with a fancy lunch or a holiday. Bought me chocolates and books as I was healing. 

Eventually the framing became understandably too much for him. He told me he wanted to marry me but he just couldn't do it anymore and left without a trace.

I didn't hear from him for weeks and weeks. Then got an email from him saying no contact was the best way for him to heal.

18 months passed and I had a new job in a new city and had fully recovered. We had gotten back in touch and had agreed to catch up again.

He took a day off work and we met for a coffee. He bought the coffee for me and I thought it was going to be more like a date kind of feel. I told him how happy I was that he was doing well and he said the same. We walked around and he looked at me with the same eyes he'd always looked at me with.

He walked me back to my hotel. It was really cold outside and I asked if he wanted to come inside for a bit because I had so much I wanted to say due to lack of closure. We talked for 6 hours. He said we could never work because I might get sick again with psychosis and that that was always a risk. He said he didn't want to get framed again and that he thought our meeting was platonic. But just before he went back to my hotel room he kept going on about how good I looked and how much he had wanted us to have a house together.

I told him I still loved him and wanted to make things work but he said he couldn't. He ended up kissing me and I asked what he was doing. He told me he was confused. One thing led to the other and we ended up sleeping together. He told me the sex meant nothing. Tears started rolling from my eyes and he asked if I wanted to see him off at the train station. I said no.

After that he was still sending me messages but it was a slow drip into ghosting again. 

I went no contact for the sake of my own emotional wellbeing but I unfortunately *did* relapse after 3 years of remission due to severe stress. I promised myself (and him really) that I wouldn't lapse into psychosis again. My third episode was my worst. I even ended up attempting on my life which wasn't something my non-depressed self would do. I hated myself for it.

It's been 8 months since I got ill again and I'm just now starting to get out of the illness and on the right meds. Turns out my diagnosis was wrong. I wish lost my hard-earned job due to being so ill so it's been devastating.

I sent him a message explaining that I wanted to still stay in touch as friends and accepted that we were different people now. I sought clarity for why he ghosted me after meeting up for my own peace of mind. I didn't mention our past relationship. I found myself blocked within two hours.

What am I supposed to do now? I'm grieving not just the loss of someone I wanted to build a future with, and that lost future, but also the loss of a dear friend I had known for 12 years of my life. We truly got each other, and his absence from my life is deeply felt. I am trying to recover from my third episode of illness but it just feels too hard. ",1,1752883235.0,Advice,1,0.67,False

I started sema on March 12th at 282 lbs. This morning (July 17th), I hit 230 lbs; just under the 4 month mark.

That’s over 50 lbs down, and honestly the most consistent progress I’ve ever made in my life.

What worked for me:

* Walking 3-4x a week, nothing crazy
* Sticking to water/black coffee, no liquid calories
* Protein, protein, protein.
* Eating less, but not obsessing over every bite
* Tracking everything, from doses and shots to weight changes (loss and gain) to stay on course

1m3hvje,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1m3hvje/the_life_i_imagined_with_you_both/,The Life I Imagined With You Both.,"There’s no real reason for me to write this. And yet, here I am writing to a ghost that breathes, to someone who still walks the earth and yet feels a thousand lifetimes away from me. I don’t know how to stop wanting you. I don’t even mean in that desperate, dramatic way. I mean in the way a body wants air without thinking. In the way flowers lean toward the sun even when they’ve already been stepped on.

You were never mine. But I imagined a life where you were. I imagined it in such detail that sometimes it feels more real than the one I’m actually living in. That life had your name carved into it. Your laugh in the walls. Your clothes on the floor. Your breath warming the back of my neck in the middle of winter. And I ache for it like it was taken from me. But the truth is it was never given. You rejected me. Maybe not with cruelty. But with silence. With hesitation. With the slow retreat of someone who doesn’t see a future where I am standing. And still, I stayed awhile. Just in case. Just in hope.

You have no idea how quietly I loved you. I remember the night I realized you weren’t going to choose me. It wasn’t dramatic. The sky didn’t fall.
The earth didn’t crack. But something in me shifted. Like a door that closed behind me so gently, I didn’t hear it until much later. I think grief is quieter when it has no beginning. When it doesn’t come from loss but from absence. From the life that was never held in your hands long enough to drop. I wanted it to be you. I wanted you to be the one I built everything with.
Not because I thought you were perfect, no. But because your imperfections felt like puzzles I wanted to spend the rest of my life solving.

You had this fire in you. A softness too. And I saw something sacred in that contrast. You were the kind of complicated I could’ve studied for decades and never gotten bored.
You were mystery and comfort.
You were chaos and calm. You were the feeling of coming home to someone who still makes your heart race.

And maybe I romanticized you too much. But if you’d have let me, I would’ve shown you a kind of love that didn’t ask you to be perfect. Only present. Only honest. Only trying. I would’ve met you there… I would’ve built something you could’ve believed in. Something with roots. Something that didn’t flinch when things got hard. But you didn’t want that. You didn’t want me. And that truth cuts quieter now, but it still cuts.

There are places I pass now that make me think of you. Not because we went there together. But because I once imagined us there. There’s a coffee shop I used to visit alone. And in my head, you were sitting across from me, stealing sips from my drink, your leg brushing mine under the table, your eyes tired but soft. And I’d think this is what I want. Not fireworks. Not grand declarations. Just this. Just you. Existing beside me like it’s the most natural thing in the world.

But that daydream never made it past my skin. You never saw the world I built with you in it. You never stepped inside. And so now it’s just empty rooms in my chest where your laughter never echoed. You once told me his favorite color. It was something simple maybe blue, I think. Or green. I held onto it like a secret, not because it was important in itself, but because it was a part of your world. A thread I could tug on gently, like I was quietly stitching myself closer to you. I never got to meet him. But in my mind, I already knew how to love him.

That’s the part that still gets to me.
You didn’t just say no to me. You said no to the version of me that would’ve shown up not just for you, but for both of you. That soft, steady presence I knew I could be. I pictured it. More times than I care to admit.
Sunday mornings with the smell of waffles in the air. Your son curled up on the couch with my dog’s head resting on his leg. Cartoons humming in the background. You in the kitchen, hair messy, one sock on. Me watching you like I’d never get tired of it. It wasn’t a fantasy, it was a hope. One I held gently. Carefully.
Like a tiny flame I was trying to shield from the wind.

Because I didn’t want just you.
I wanted the version of life where you were all in. Where the three of us made some weird little family that somehow worked. Where your son saw what love looked like when it was quiet and real. Where my dog found a second human to follow around, tail wagging like a metronome for how full the house felt.

Do you know how rare it is to want to love someone and their child? Do you know what it means to imagine building a home, not just for yourself, but for someone else’s heart too?
That was never obligation to me.
It was privilege. It was purpose. And I know I’m romanticizing this.
I know there’s a difference between loving the idea of someone and living the truth of them day after day.

But this wasn’t just some illusion I made up in the fog. This was desire. Rooted. Grounded. Intentional. I didn’t want you because I was lonely.
I wanted you because I saw something worth staying for. Worth building around. Worth protecting.
And you looked at that, at me and said no.

Maybe not directly. Maybe not with words. But your absence spoke loudly. Your retreat was a language I understood all too well. I still remember that one text the one you never answered. I’d asked something simple. Something small. And I waited. And waited. And something inside me wilted just a little more with every hour that passed. That’s the thing about silence. It doesn’t scream. It erodes. And even now, I catch myself wondering if you ever think about it. About me. About what could’ve been if you had just leaned in a little.

What if we’d gone grocery shopping together? What if I’d made your son laugh so hard he spilled juice on the carpet and we both yelled, and then laughed ourselves into the floor?
What if you’d curled up next to me one night and whispered that it felt like home?

You’ll never know how easily I could have stayed.I don’t love easily. Not anymore. I’ve been let down too many times. But with you C … I wanted to risk it. That was the scariest part. You made me want to try again. And maybe that’s why it hurts like this, because I wasn’t grieving someone who hurt me. I was grieving someone who never let me love them.

Grief doesn’t always come with screaming. Sometimes, it shows up in gentle ways. In the way I pause when I see a hoodie like the one you wore. In the way I still hear your voice in songs I know you’ve never heard.

Sometimes, I think grief is just love that has nowhere to go. I try not to think about you too much. But the world makes that difficult. A laugh that sounds like yours on the street.
A spunky kid jumping around in a grocery store aisle. A leash in someone else’s hand, with a dog that looks just like mine. For a second, I pretend it’s us. For a second, the ache is sweet. Then it sharpens. You’re everywhere and nowhere.
Like a ghost who refuses to haunt me properly. Not quite present. Not quite gone.

There are nights when I still catch myself thinking about the way you  kissed me back. Soft at first. Then needy. Like you’d finally exhaled after holding your breath too long. Like you were just as afraid of wanting me as I was of not being wanted. I wanted to met you there.
I would’ve held your fear as gently as your face. I would’ve traced every bruise the past left on your heart, and kissed each one like it meant something sacred. Because it did.
I didn’t want the easy parts of you.
I wanted it all your doubts, your stubbornness, your messy past, your child’s bedtime stories. I wanted your Tuesday mornings and your Sunday sadness. I wanted to be the person who saw your worst and stayed anyway.

But I never got the chance. You saw the edges of me and stepped back.
You never looked long enough to see that I was offering you something real. Something soft. Something rare.
And I get it. I do. Maybe you weren’t ready. Maybe I reminded you of something you didn’t want to feel again. Or maybe you just didn’t want me.

I’ve spun every version of this story in my head. In some, you’re scared. In others, careless. But the hardest ones to live with are the ones where you simply didn’t feel what I felt. There’s no villain in those versions. Just me. Standing in a garden that never bloomed, watering soil that never held your seeds. You were never cruel to me. And maybe that’s why this hurts so much. Because I don’t hate you. Because you just never held my heart..

And so, the pain doesn’t come with rage. It comes with longing. With questions that don’t have answers.
With love letters that will never be sent. Like this one. I write this knowing you’ll probably never read it.
But I also know you live in the folds of my memory like a pressed flower, fragile, beautiful, and already fading at the edges. Still, I keep you. I keep the version of you I once believed in.
The one who might’ve stayed. The one who might’ve let me braid a life with yours. Our days like thread. Our nights like poems. Our hearts, maybe, unafraid.

Some nights, I still make space for you in my dreams. Not by choice, 
more like muscle memory. Like the way my dog finds the spot by the door where you never stood and still curls up there sometimes, as if waiting.

He knew about you, even though you never met. Maybe not your name, but the way my voice softened when I spoke of you. The way I sighed when your name lit up my phone
and exhaled differently when it didn’t. He noticed the shift in the air.
Dogs always do. He’d watch me from across the room when I sat staring at nothing, when I played a song you’d never heard on repeat, when I’d get up halfway through a show and never come back to the couch. He knew I was waiting for someone
who didn’t know how to arrive.

I think that’s what love can become 
a kind of waiting. A holding open of the door, even when no one’s knocking. And I held it open for too long. You were the only one I imagined sharing my quiet with. The mundane. The real. The stillness. The groceries. The shared toothbrush drawer. The way your son would ask for help with homework while my dog dropped a toy at your feet and wagged like he’d never known a day without you. You never let me build that with you. And yet, it’s all still here. In the back of my mind like a film I directed but never got to cast.

Sometimes I picture you barefoot in my kitchen. Hair messy. Shoulders loose. T-shirt too big… maybe mine..
You’re humming something you don’t even realize, and I’m watching from the doorway thinking, this is it. This is everything I never knew I was allowed to want. That image plays on a loop in the part of me that doesn’t care if it’s real anymore. Just that it feels true. You made me want things I’d stopped believing in. You made me imagine softness that stayed. You made me hope again, 
and then left me with it. I used to think heartbreak was loud. That it came with screaming, door slams,
thunder, glass.

But this? This was soft. Like someone turning the volume down on a song just before your favorite part. Like a goodbye whispered from across the street with traffic between you. Like the way someone disappears by simply not showing up. I kept waiting for a moment.
Some grand closure. A sharp edge to wrap this pain around. But you never gave me an ending. Only silence. Only maybe. Only the slow death of something that never fully lived. 

I remember the first things you said to me. The flickers. The things that didn’t feel like anything at the time
but now feel like everything. The way your name looked on my screen. How I started smiling without meaning to. The way your laugh loosened something in my chest
that had been locked up for years.
That’s how it began. Not with fireworks. But with warmth.

You never touched me the way I hoped you would, but I remember the nearness. The way you’d lean in when you talked. The way your eyes softened like maybe, just maybe, you saw me. There were times I thought you might reach for me. Moments stretched out like held breath. But you never did. And I never asked.

We danced around something sacred. Too afraid to call it love.
Too afraid to name a thing that might vanish if spoken out loud. But it was there. In the spaces between. In the way I noticed everything about you.. Not because I was trying to, but because my heart paid attention.

The chipped nail polish. The way your hands moved when you were thinking. How you blinked more when you were nervous. How your voice changed when you talked your son.
How your smile got smaller when you were hiding something. How you looked like you were constantly carrying a weight that no one else could see. I saw you. And I think that terrified you. You were always quick to retreat when things got close.
You’d say something sweet and then vanish for days. You’d share something vulnerable, then act like it never happened. I tried to be patient.
To give you space to breathe. But every time I stepped closer, you pulled away. And every time I stepped back, I hoped you’d follow.
You never did. So I stayed somewhere in the middle. Balancing my hope on the edge of your uncertainty. And I told myself that was enough. That maybe one day, you’d see me standing there and finally reach.

But now I realize you were never reaching. Only drifting. And still, I find myself clinging to the almosts. Because they’re all I have. The conversation that almost turned into something deeper. The glance that almost meant something more. The feeling I almost voiced. The future I almost believed in. I would’ve built a life out of those almosts. Brick by brick. If you had just chosen to stay.
I would’ve loved you softly at first then fiercely. Like wind. Like wildfire.
Like someone who knew that love doesn’t always come dressed in perfection, but in the willingness to stay when it’s easier to run. But you ran. Or maybe you just walked away slowly, hoping I wouldn’t notice until you were already gone.

And still I whisper things to the empty air like you can hear me. I tell you how your absence still echoes. How I still remember the version of you I never got to meet. The one who leaned in. The one who stayed.

Some mornings, I open my eyes and forget, just for a second, that you’re not coming back. That there was never a goodbye. Only your absence,
folding itself into my routines
like it belonged there. My dog wakes me up the same way he always does, soft, patient, expectant. He doesn’t know how heavy mornings have become. Or maybe he does, and just doesn’t say anything. There’s comfort in that. In being seen without being asked to speak.

He doesn’t understand the way I hold onto the memory of someone who never truly arrived. But he understands waiting. He understands staying. He never left.
Not when I cried on the floor. Not when I got quiet. Not when I stopped playing the music I used to show you. He stays. And sometimes, that’s enough to keep me going. There’s something holy in a creature who doesn’t need words to say, I’m still here. I wonder if your son feels that kind of loyalty when he looks at you.
If he knows what it means to be someone’s whole world. Because I was ready to offer him that. To offer you that. But I can’t give what someone won’t take. And that’s what healing looks like lately learning to stop offering myself to someone who keeps their hands in their pockets.

Learning that silence isn’t always a test. Sometimes it’s an answer. I still dream about you. Less frequently now, but when I do, it always hurts in the sweetest way. You’re smiling. You’re laughing at something I said.
And I think this is what it could’ve been. This is what love might’ve looked like if you’d just stayed still long enough to let it bloom. And when I wake up, there’s always a heaviness.

Not the sharp stab of loss but the quiet ache of memory. Of muscle remembering how to reach for something that’s no longer there. Some days I do okay. I go to work. I make my bed. I laugh at a joke I read online. And no one knows that I’m still carrying you in the back pocket of my heart. Other days, I spiral over something as stupid as a song. Or the way the light hits my living room
at exactly the hour you used to text me. You’re not a person anymore.
You’re a feeling. A ripple. A shadow I still flinch toward. And maybe that’s what you were always meant to be 
not a chapter, but a ghost between pages. I still hold you softly. Not out of hope anymore but out of love that has nowhere else to go. I’m not angry. Just hollow in the spaces I made for you.

The seasons have changed since I last seen you. Or since I was yours.
Or since I almost was. Whatever version of the truth fits. Spring turned to summer. The flowers bloomed and died. And somewhere in the middle,
I stopped checking my phone. Not because I don’t think of you. But because I had to stop hoping you’d think of me. There’s something so cruel about the way the earth keeps turning, even when your heart is stuck.

The wanting doesn’t leave. It just changes shape. Like fog lifting slowly. Still damp. Still clinging. But less blinding. I sometimes wonder if the trees remember me from when I whispered your name into the wind.
From when I paused beneath their branches and imagined your laugh bouncing between them. I used to daydream about you walking beside me. Your son chasing leaves ahead of us. My dog tugging at the leash, thrilled by the noise, the air, the life.
We’d get coffee. He’d want chocolate milk. You’d steal a sip from my cup and smile without apology. And I’d think this is it. This is what they mean when they talk about peace. But seasons pass. Dreams fade. Leaves fall.

And not everything comes back in spring. I’m still learning how to let you be something that happened to me
and not something I failed to protect.
Because I still wonder if I could’ve done more. If I should’ve fought harder. If I should’ve told you how deep it really went. But then I remember that I did. I showed up. I stayed soft. I stood there with my hands open while you carried your silence like a shield. And that’s not on me. The hardest part of healing is admitting that you were given a choice and you didn’t choose me.
That you looked at all I was willing to give, and turned away.

Even now, on warm days when the sun hits just right, I swear I can feel the ghost of the life I wanted. A flash. A flicker. Your son’s laughter, my dog’s bark, your voice saying, “Let’s just stay here a little longer.” But I’m alone on the porch. My coffee’s gone cold. And your voice is only memory now. Still, I hold it gently. Because even if I never got the ending, you were the first story I wanted to write
without leaving any pages blank.

There’s a version of me in some parallel thread of time, where you stayed. Where your yes was quiet but sure. Where your fears showed up, but so did your hands. And they reached for mine. In that world, I am not writing this letter. I’m asleep in a bed warmed by your breath. Your son is dreaming down the hall. My dog has curled into the crook of your knees. And the house is quiet not from absence, but from peace. I visit that version of us sometimes. In sleep. In daydreams. In the way my soul detaches from this reality just long enough to imagine what it felt like to be chosen by you.

And I hold that version gently. Like a snow globe. A world I can shake and stare into, even though I’ll never step inside. Do you feel it, too? The echo of the life we didn’t live? Maybe when you walk past someone who wears my scent. Or when your son says something you didn’t realize I once said. Or when the night is too quiet
and your mind begins to wander toward what if. I wonder if there are moments where your heart stutters for no reason and it’s me. My name never said aloud, but felt like a chill in a warm room. There are versions of us in every shadow. The one where we met sooner. The one where you were ready. The one where I didn’t have to prove my love by standing in place while you vanished over and over again.

In one, you call me “home.” Not just in the poetic sense but in the way people call out when they walk in the door and expect to be held. In another, you teach your son how to trust, and I show him how loyalty looks when it comes wrapped in fur and silence and the soft weight of a dog who listens without question. In one, we fight. We cry. But we don’t run. And the storm passes. And you say, “Let’s fix it. Let’s try again. That’s the one I live in most. It’s the most human. The most possible. The one that feels the cruelest, too because we were almost that close. But we didn’t make it. We were a constellation that never aligned. A song that skipped before the chorus. And now, I live in a version of reality where you are not mine.

Where your silence is louder than any goodbye. Where I feed my dog, walk him through our routine, and he doesn’t know that I imagined your son feeding him treats by hand. That I imagined teaching both of them how to sit, how to stay, how to love without condition. I don’t live there anymore in the life we never built. But I visit. And when I do, I leave flowers at the doorstep of the home I once dreamed we’d grow old in. There’s something sacred about loving someone who never let you love them back. Not noble. Not selfless. Just… sacred. Like planting a garden
even when you know winter is coming too soon.

I still think about you.Not every day anymore. But enough that it still surprises me how grief can become background noise, a hum beneath the rhythm of life. You taught me that. Without trying. Without knowing. You taught me that I can love without being asked to. That my heart can offer something whole
even when it’s not received. That showing up matters even if I’m the only one standing in the rain. I don’t regret loving you. I don’t regret the hope. I don’t regret the way I pictured your son with my dog, the way I imagined kissing your forehead after a long day, the way I dreamed of holidays that felt like healing. What I grieve now isn’t just you. It’s the version of me I became when I believed in us. The soft one. The open one.The one who stood barefoot in the doorway of my own heart and said, come in. Stay. I’ll make space.

That version of me still lives here,
somewhere underneath the bruises. She’s quieter now. But she survived.
And maybe that’s what this was meant to be a reminder that I still know how to love like that. Even after everything. Even without you. There is beauty in things left unfinished. Not everything is meant to be tied up in a bow. Some stories end mid-sentence. Some people leave before the poem is done.

And that doesn’t make the lines I wrote for you any less true. Any less beautiful. You will always be a chapter I wanted to keep writing. A door I would’ve kept open. A hand I would’ve held until my own grew old. But now I write for myself again.Now I hold my own hand in the dark.
Now I walk the dog alone, but I do it with a heart that knows it was brave enough to try. Brave enough to dream. Brave enough to love without a guarantee. You didn’t choose me. But I chose love. And in the end, that’s something I get to carry forward. You told me you didn’t feel the way I felt. You said you still wanted to be friends and I know you meant it gently. But even gentle words can land like breaking glass
when you’ve built your heart around someone. I didn’t know how to be “just friends” with someone I had already imagined building a life with.
I didn’t know how to shrink my love into something casual, to unthread the quiet dreams I’d sewn around you. So I stayed quiet. I stepped back. Not to punish you but to protect what was left of me.

And maybe you don’t understand that. Maybe to you, it looks like distance. But to me, it’s grace. It’s learning not to reach for someone
who doesn’t reach back with the same kind of hunger. I still think of you. Like longing, or peace that hasn’t fully arrived. You’re a name I don’t say out loud anymore. But you still live in the spaces between songs, in certain kinds of weather,
in the way my dog perks up at the door sometimes as if he remembers the idea of you before you ever became real. You’re still here, in some unspoken way. And maybe that’s enough right now. Not a clean goodbye. Not a promise to wait.
Just… this. This letter I’m writing with no one to send it to, but with all of me in it. If you ever wonder if I cared, if I meant it, if I was serious when I said I wanted you.. You don’t have to ask.

It’s written everywhere. In how I speak your name in my own head. In how I carry the love you didn’t return. In how I still wish you well from this quiet distance. And maybe, in some different life, we made it work. Maybe we sat side by side at the end of a long day, watching your son and my dog curled up on the floor like they’d always belonged together. Maybe you leaned your head on my shoulder and said, “Thank you for not giving up on me.” But for now, I’ll just keep walking forward. Not away from you. Just toward myself. And if you ever find your way back not out of guilt, not out of loneliness, but because something deep inside you finally knows what I was offering I’ll still be me. Softer. Wiser. Still loving you in ways you may never fully understand.

1m3hv13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Letters_Unsent/comments/1m3hv13/the_life_i_imagined_with_you_both/,The Life I Imagined With You Both.,"There’s no real reason for me to write this. And yet, here I am writing to a ghost that breathes, to someone who still walks the earth and yet feels a thousand lifetimes away from me. I don’t know how to stop wanting you. I don’t even mean in that desperate, dramatic way. I mean in the way a body wants air without thinking. In the way flowers lean toward the sun even when they’ve already been stepped on.

You were never mine. But I imagined a life where you were. I imagined it in such detail that sometimes it feels more real than the one I’m actually living in. That life had your name carved into it. Your laugh in the walls. Your clothes on the floor. Your breath warming the back of my neck in the middle of winter. And I ache for it like it was taken from me. But the truth is it was never given. You rejected me. Maybe not with cruelty. But with silence. With hesitation. With the slow retreat of someone who doesn’t see a future where I am standing. And still, I stayed awhile. Just in case. Just in hope.

You have no idea how quietly I loved you. I remember the night I realized you weren’t going to choose me. It wasn’t dramatic. The sky didn’t fall.
The earth didn’t crack. But something in me shifted. Like a door that closed behind me so gently, I didn’t hear it until much later. I think grief is quieter when it has no beginning. When it doesn’t come from loss but from absence. From the life that was never held in your hands long enough to drop. I wanted it to be you. I wanted you to be the one I built everything with.
Not because I thought you were perfect, no. But because your imperfections felt like puzzles I wanted to spend the rest of my life solving.

You had this fire in you. A softness too. And I saw something sacred in that contrast. You were the kind of complicated I could’ve studied for decades and never gotten bored.
You were mystery and comfort.
You were chaos and calm. You were the feeling of coming home to someone who still makes your heart race.

And maybe I romanticized you too much. But if you’d have let me, I would’ve shown you a kind of love that didn’t ask you to be perfect. Only present. Only honest. Only trying. I would’ve met you there… I would’ve built something you could’ve believed in. Something with roots. Something that didn’t flinch when things got hard. But you didn’t want that. You didn’t want me. And that truth cuts quieter now, but it still cuts.

There are places I pass now that make me think of you. Not because we went there together. But because I once imagined us there. There’s a coffee shop I used to visit alone. And in my head, you were sitting across from me, stealing sips from my drink, your leg brushing mine under the table, your eyes tired but soft. And I’d think this is what I want. Not fireworks. Not grand declarations. Just this. Just you. Existing beside me like it’s the most natural thing in the world.

But that daydream never made it past my skin. You never saw the world I built with you in it. You never stepped inside. And so now it’s just empty rooms in my chest where your laughter never echoed. You once told me his favorite color. It was something simple maybe blue, I think. Or green. I held onto it like a secret, not because it was important in itself, but because it was a part of your world. A thread I could tug on gently, like I was quietly stitching myself closer to you. I never got to meet him. But in my mind, I already knew how to love him.

That’s the part that still gets to me.
You didn’t just say no to me. You said no to the version of me that would’ve shown up not just for you, but for both of you. That soft, steady presence I knew I could be. I pictured it. More times than I care to admit.
Sunday mornings with the smell of waffles in the air. Your son curled up on the couch with my dog’s head resting on his leg. Cartoons humming in the background. You in the kitchen, hair messy, one sock on. Me watching you like I’d never get tired of it. It wasn’t a fantasy, it was a hope. One I held gently. Carefully.
Like a tiny flame I was trying to shield from the wind.

Because I didn’t want just you.
I wanted the version of life where you were all in. Where the three of us made some weird little family that somehow worked. Where your son saw what love looked like when it was quiet and real. Where my dog found a second human to follow around, tail wagging like a metronome for how full the house felt.

Do you know how rare it is to want to love someone and their child? Do you know what it means to imagine building a home, not just for yourself, but for someone else’s heart too?
That was never obligation to me.
It was privilege. It was purpose. And I know I’m romanticizing this.
I know there’s a difference between loving the idea of someone and living the truth of them day after day.

But this wasn’t just some illusion I made up in the fog. This was desire. Rooted. Grounded. Intentional. I didn’t want you because I was lonely.
I wanted you because I saw something worth staying for. Worth building around. Worth protecting.
And you looked at that, at me and said no.

Maybe not directly. Maybe not with words. But your absence spoke loudly. Your retreat was a language I understood all too well. I still remember that one text the one you never answered. I’d asked something simple. Something small. And I waited. And waited. And something inside me wilted just a little more with every hour that passed. That’s the thing about silence. It doesn’t scream. It erodes. And even now, I catch myself wondering if you ever think about it. About me. About what could’ve been if you had just leaned in a little.

What if we’d gone grocery shopping together? What if I’d made your son laugh so hard he spilled juice on the carpet and we both yelled, and then laughed ourselves into the floor?
What if you’d curled up next to me one night and whispered that it felt like home?

You’ll never know how easily I could have stayed.I don’t love easily. Not anymore. I’ve been let down too many times. But with you C … I wanted to risk it. That was the scariest part. You made me want to try again. And maybe that’s why it hurts like this, because I wasn’t grieving someone who hurt me. I was grieving someone who never let me love them.

Grief doesn’t always come with screaming. Sometimes, it shows up in gentle ways. In the way I pause when I see a hoodie like the one you wore. In the way I still hear your voice in songs I know you’ve never heard.

Sometimes, I think grief is just love that has nowhere to go. I try not to think about you too much. But the world makes that difficult. A laugh that sounds like yours on the street.
A spunky kid jumping around in a grocery store aisle. A leash in someone else’s hand, with a dog that looks just like mine. For a second, I pretend it’s us. For a second, the ache is sweet. Then it sharpens. You’re everywhere and nowhere.
Like a ghost who refuses to haunt me properly. Not quite present. Not quite gone.

There are nights when I still catch myself thinking about the way you  kissed me back. Soft at first. Then needy. Like you’d finally exhaled after holding your breath too long. Like you were just as afraid of wanting me as I was of not being wanted. I wanted to met you there.
I would’ve held your fear as gently as your face. I would’ve traced every bruise the past left on your heart, and kissed each one like it meant something sacred. Because it did.
I didn’t want the easy parts of you.
I wanted it all your doubts, your stubbornness, your messy past, your child’s bedtime stories. I wanted your Tuesday mornings and your Sunday sadness. I wanted to be the person who saw your worst and stayed anyway.

But I never got the chance. You saw the edges of me and stepped back.
You never looked long enough to see that I was offering you something real. Something soft. Something rare.
And I get it. I do. Maybe you weren’t ready. Maybe I reminded you of something you didn’t want to feel again. Or maybe you just didn’t want me.

I’ve spun every version of this story in my head. In some, you’re scared. In others, careless. But the hardest ones to live with are the ones where you simply didn’t feel what I felt. There’s no villain in those versions. Just me. Standing in a garden that never bloomed, watering soil that never held your seeds. You were never cruel to me. And maybe that’s why this hurts so much. Because I don’t hate you. Because you just never held my heart..

And so, the pain doesn’t come with rage. It comes with longing. With questions that don’t have answers.
With love letters that will never be sent. Like this one. I write this knowing you’ll probably never read it.
But I also know you live in the folds of my memory like a pressed flower, fragile, beautiful, and already fading at the edges. Still, I keep you. I keep the version of you I once believed in.
The one who might’ve stayed. The one who might’ve let me braid a life with yours. Our days like thread. Our nights like poems. Our hearts, maybe, unafraid.

Some nights, I still make space for you in my dreams. Not by choice, 
more like muscle memory. Like the way my dog finds the spot by the door where you never stood and still curls up there sometimes, as if waiting.

He knew about you, even though you never met. Maybe not your name, but the way my voice softened when I spoke of you. The way I sighed when your name lit up my phone
and exhaled differently when it didn’t. He noticed the shift in the air.
Dogs always do. He’d watch me from across the room when I sat staring at nothing, when I played a song you’d never heard on repeat, when I’d get up halfway through a show and never come back to the couch. He knew I was waiting for someone
who didn’t know how to arrive.

I think that’s what love can become 
a kind of waiting. A holding open of the door, even when no one’s knocking. And I held it open for too long. You were the only one I imagined sharing my quiet with. The mundane. The real. The stillness. The groceries. The shared toothbrush drawer. The way your son would ask for help with homework while my dog dropped a toy at your feet and wagged like he’d never known a day without you. You never let me build that with you. And yet, it’s all still here. In the back of my mind like a film I directed but never got to cast.

Sometimes I picture you barefoot in my kitchen. Hair messy. Shoulders loose. T-shirt too big… maybe mine..
You’re humming something you don’t even realize, and I’m watching from the doorway thinking, this is it. This is everything I never knew I was allowed to want. That image plays on a loop in the part of me that doesn’t care if it’s real anymore. Just that it feels true. You made me want things I’d stopped believing in. You made me imagine softness that stayed. You made me hope again, 
and then left me with it. I used to think heartbreak was loud. That it came with screaming, door slams,
thunder, glass.

But this? This was soft. Like someone turning the volume down on a song just before your favorite part. Like a goodbye whispered from across the street with traffic between you. Like the way someone disappears by simply not showing up. I kept waiting for a moment.
Some grand closure. A sharp edge to wrap this pain around. But you never gave me an ending. Only silence. Only maybe. Only the slow death of something that never fully lived. 

I remember the first things you said to me. The flickers. The things that didn’t feel like anything at the time
but now feel like everything. The way your name looked on my screen. How I started smiling without meaning to. The way your laugh loosened something in my chest
that had been locked up for years.
That’s how it began. Not with fireworks. But with warmth.

You never touched me the way I hoped you would, but I remember the nearness. The way you’d lean in when you talked. The way your eyes softened like maybe, just maybe, you saw me. There were times I thought you might reach for me. Moments stretched out like held breath. But you never did. And I never asked.

We danced around something sacred. Too afraid to call it love.
Too afraid to name a thing that might vanish if spoken out loud. But it was there. In the spaces between. In the way I noticed everything about you.. Not because I was trying to, but because my heart paid attention.

The chipped nail polish. The way your hands moved when you were thinking. How you blinked more when you were nervous. How your voice changed when you talked your son.
How your smile got smaller when you were hiding something. How you looked like you were constantly carrying a weight that no one else could see. I saw you. And I think that terrified you. You were always quick to retreat when things got close.
You’d say something sweet and then vanish for days. You’d share something vulnerable, then act like it never happened. I tried to be patient.
To give you space to breathe. But every time I stepped closer, you pulled away. And every time I stepped back, I hoped you’d follow.
You never did. So I stayed somewhere in the middle. Balancing my hope on the edge of your uncertainty. And I told myself that was enough. That maybe one day, you’d see me standing there and finally reach.

But now I realize you were never reaching. Only drifting. And still, I find myself clinging to the almosts. Because they’re all I have. The conversation that almost turned into something deeper. The glance that almost meant something more. The feeling I almost voiced. The future I almost believed in. I would’ve built a life out of those almosts. Brick by brick. If you had just chosen to stay.
I would’ve loved you softly at first then fiercely. Like wind. Like wildfire.
Like someone who knew that love doesn’t always come dressed in perfection, but in the willingness to stay when it’s easier to run. But you ran. Or maybe you just walked away slowly, hoping I wouldn’t notice until you were already gone.

And still I whisper things to the empty air like you can hear me. I tell you how your absence still echoes. How I still remember the version of you I never got to meet. The one who leaned in. The one who stayed.

Some mornings, I open my eyes and forget, just for a second, that you’re not coming back. That there was never a goodbye. Only your absence,
folding itself into my routines
like it belonged there. My dog wakes me up the same way he always does, soft, patient, expectant. He doesn’t know how heavy mornings have become. Or maybe he does, and just doesn’t say anything. There’s comfort in that. In being seen without being asked to speak.

He doesn’t understand the way I hold onto the memory of someone who never truly arrived. But he understands waiting. He understands staying. He never left.
Not when I cried on the floor. Not when I got quiet. Not when I stopped playing the music I used to show you. He stays. And sometimes, that’s enough to keep me going. There’s something holy in a creature who doesn’t need words to say, I’m still here. I wonder if your son feels that kind of loyalty when he looks at you.
If he knows what it means to be someone’s whole world. Because I was ready to offer him that. To offer you that. But I can’t give what someone won’t take. And that’s what healing looks like lately learning to stop offering myself to someone who keeps their hands in their pockets.

Learning that silence isn’t always a test. Sometimes it’s an answer. I still dream about you. Less frequently now, but when I do, it always hurts in the sweetest way. You’re smiling. You’re laughing at something I said.
And I think this is what it could’ve been. This is what love might’ve looked like if you’d just stayed still long enough to let it bloom. And when I wake up, there’s always a heaviness.

Not the sharp stab of loss but the quiet ache of memory. Of muscle remembering how to reach for something that’s no longer there. Some days I do okay. I go to work. I make my bed. I laugh at a joke I read online. And no one knows that I’m still carrying you in the back pocket of my heart. Other days, I spiral over something as stupid as a song. Or the way the light hits my living room
at exactly the hour you used to text me. You’re not a person anymore.
You’re a feeling. A ripple. A shadow I still flinch toward. And maybe that’s what you were always meant to be 
not a chapter, but a ghost between pages. I still hold you softly. Not out of hope anymore but out of love that has nowhere else to go. I’m not angry. Just hollow in the spaces I made for you.

The seasons have changed since I last seen you. Or since I was yours.
Or since I almost was. Whatever version of the truth fits. Spring turned to summer. The flowers bloomed and died. And somewhere in the middle,
I stopped checking my phone. Not because I don’t think of you. But because I had to stop hoping you’d think of me. There’s something so cruel about the way the earth keeps turning, even when your heart is stuck.

The wanting doesn’t leave. It just changes shape. Like fog lifting slowly. Still damp. Still clinging. But less blinding. I sometimes wonder if the trees remember me from when I whispered your name into the wind.
From when I paused beneath their branches and imagined your laugh bouncing between them. I used to daydream about you walking beside me. Your son chasing leaves ahead of us. My dog tugging at the leash, thrilled by the noise, the air, the life.
We’d get coffee. He’d want chocolate milk. You’d steal a sip from my cup and smile without apology. And I’d think this is it. This is what they mean when they talk about peace. But seasons pass. Dreams fade. Leaves fall.

And not everything comes back in spring. I’m still learning how to let you be something that happened to me
and not something I failed to protect.
Because I still wonder if I could’ve done more. If I should’ve fought harder. If I should’ve told you how deep it really went. But then I remember that I did. I showed up. I stayed soft. I stood there with my hands open while you carried your silence like a shield. And that’s not on me. The hardest part of healing is admitting that you were given a choice and you didn’t choose me.
That you looked at all I was willing to give, and turned away.

Even now, on warm days when the sun hits just right, I swear I can feel the ghost of the life I wanted. A flash. A flicker. Your son’s laughter, my dog’s bark, your voice saying, “Let’s just stay here a little longer.” But I’m alone on the porch. My coffee’s gone cold. And your voice is only memory now. Still, I hold it gently. Because even if I never got the ending, you were the first story I wanted to write
without leaving any pages blank.

There’s a version of me in some parallel thread of time, where you stayed. Where your yes was quiet but sure. Where your fears showed up, but so did your hands. And they reached for mine. In that world, I am not writing this letter. I’m asleep in a bed warmed by your breath. Your son is dreaming down the hall. My dog has curled into the crook of your knees. And the house is quiet not from absence, but from peace. I visit that version of us sometimes. In sleep. In daydreams. In the way my soul detaches from this reality just long enough to imagine what it felt like to be chosen by you.

And I hold that version gently. Like a snow globe. A world I can shake and stare into, even though I’ll never step inside. Do you feel it, too? The echo of the life we didn’t live? Maybe when you walk past someone who wears my scent. Or when your son says something you didn’t realize I once said. Or when the night is too quiet
and your mind begins to wander toward what if. I wonder if there are moments where your heart stutters for no reason and it’s me. My name never said aloud, but felt like a chill in a warm room. There are versions of us in every shadow. The one where we met sooner. The one where you were ready. The one where I didn’t have to prove my love by standing in place while you vanished over and over again.

In one, you call me “home.” Not just in the poetic sense but in the way people call out when they walk in the door and expect to be held. In another, you teach your son how to trust, and I show him how loyalty looks when it comes wrapped in fur and silence and the soft weight of a dog who listens without question. In one, we fight. We cry. But we don’t run. And the storm passes. And you say, “Let’s fix it. Let’s try again. That’s the one I live in most. It’s the most human. The most possible. The one that feels the cruelest, too because we were almost that close. But we didn’t make it. We were a constellation that never aligned. A song that skipped before the chorus. And now, I live in a version of reality where you are not mine.

Where your silence is louder than any goodbye. Where I feed my dog, walk him through our routine, and he doesn’t know that I imagined your son feeding him treats by hand. That I imagined teaching both of them how to sit, how to stay, how to love without condition. I don’t live there anymore in the life we never built. But I visit. And when I do, I leave flowers at the doorstep of the home I once dreamed we’d grow old in. There’s something sacred about loving someone who never let you love them back. Not noble. Not selfless. Just… sacred. Like planting a garden
even when you know winter is coming too soon.

I still think about you.Not every day anymore. But enough that it still surprises me how grief can become background noise, a hum beneath the rhythm of life. You taught me that. Without trying. Without knowing. You taught me that I can love without being asked to. That my heart can offer something whole
even when it’s not received. That showing up matters even if I’m the only one standing in the rain. I don’t regret loving you. I don’t regret the hope. I don’t regret the way I pictured your son with my dog, the way I imagined kissing your forehead after a long day, the way I dreamed of holidays that felt like healing. What I grieve now isn’t just you. It’s the version of me I became when I believed in us. The soft one. The open one.The one who stood barefoot in the doorway of my own heart and said, come in. Stay. I’ll make space.

That version of me still lives here,
somewhere underneath the bruises. She’s quieter now. But she survived.
And maybe that’s what this was meant to be a reminder that I still know how to love like that. Even after everything. Even without you. There is beauty in things left unfinished. Not everything is meant to be tied up in a bow. Some stories end mid-sentence. Some people leave before the poem is done.

And that doesn’t make the lines I wrote for you any less true. Any less beautiful. You will always be a chapter I wanted to keep writing. A door I would’ve kept open. A hand I would’ve held until my own grew old. But now I write for myself again.Now I hold my own hand in the dark.
Now I walk the dog alone, but I do it with a heart that knows it was brave enough to try. Brave enough to dream. Brave enough to love without a guarantee. You didn’t choose me. But I chose love. And in the end, that’s something I get to carry forward. You told me you didn’t feel the way I felt. You said you still wanted to be friends and I know you meant it gently. But even gentle words can land like breaking glass
when you’ve built your heart around someone. I didn’t know how to be “just friends” with someone I had already imagined building a life with.
I didn’t know how to shrink my love into something casual, to unthread the quiet dreams I’d sewn around you. So I stayed quiet. I stepped back. Not to punish you but to protect what was left of me.

And maybe you don’t understand that. Maybe to you, it looks like distance. But to me, it’s grace. It’s learning not to reach for someone
who doesn’t reach back with the same kind of hunger. I still think of you. Like longing, or peace that hasn’t fully arrived. You’re a name I don’t say out loud anymore. But you still live in the spaces between songs, in certain kinds of weather,
in the way my dog perks up at the door sometimes as if he remembers the idea of you before you ever became real. You’re still here, in some unspoken way. And maybe that’s enough right now. Not a clean goodbye. Not a promise to wait.
Just… this. This letter I’m writing with no one to send it to, but with all of me in it. If you ever wonder if I cared, if I meant it, if I was serious when I said I wanted you.. You don’t have to ask.

It’s written everywhere. In how I speak your name in my own head. In how I carry the love you didn’t return. In how I still wish you well from this quiet distance. And maybe, in some different life, we made it work. Maybe we sat side by side at the end of a long day, watching your son and my dog curled up on the floor like they’d always belonged together. Maybe you leaned your head on my shoulder and said, “Thank you for not giving up on me.” But for now, I’ll just keep walking forward. Not away from you. Just toward myself. And if you ever find your way back not out of guilt, not out of loneliness, but because something deep inside you finally knows what I was offering I’ll still be me. Softer. Wiser. Still loving you in ways you may never fully understand.

1m3humm,https://i.redd.it/h5s7zdxk0qdf1.jpeg,3 Osmofolia Reviews,"A review of the three Osmofolia scents in my possession, which I've been using for over a year now! I usually prefer bright photorealistic scents from indies and this brand leans a little bit closer to a more blended traditional style, but I think the concepts and notes are still unique. Compared to other houses, I also really appreciate the subtlety of these scents and how they wear close to skin (at least on me).

Sawdust- cedar, driftwood, wood shavings, sawdust
 I bought this before looking at other reviews and assumed it would be a home depot kind of smell, and it's definitely not that (that's on me of course). This is a more creative impression of the smell of sawdust that makes it a lot prettier and sweeter. I think i would like smelling this on another person, but there's something in the smell that makes it go a little candlelike on me which I don't like. More objectively it's like a light, sweet echo of wood furniture in an antique store. Pleasant but not for me. 

Cabin-coffee, lavender, white cedar, black spruce, red pine, rain, vanilla
 I'm from Oregon and the notes of this scent immediately looked like my hometown in a bottle, so I had to get it. I was also wanting to start experimenting with more masculine/androgynous scents and Cabin felt like a friendly start. It's herby, sharp, and wet forest on first sniff but isn't too loud once I apply on skin. The coffee for me adds to the mountainous vibe and also grounds it. It's comforting enough for me to use it as a sleep scent sometimes and doesn't feel exclusively like a outdoorsy smell. I feel like I'm some kind of lesbian lumberjack in a warm cabin when I wear it! 

Silk-fabric, petals, steamed cloth, dry earth, silk
 The notes both separately and in combination were so unique that I bought this one in full size out of pure intrigue. After smelling and wearing it, I'm actually left even more confused and intrigued, every single time. I pull it out and put it on sometimes just for my own fun smelling my wrist every couple of minutes as a little sensory fun lmao. I don't understand how on earth Osmofolia created a steamed cloth smell but that is exactly what it is. Even without any kind of temperature, smelling Silk makes my nose feel as though I just breathed in a little steam from ironing fresh laundry. The petal smell adds to the freshness of it, and smells like just petals, not a whole flower or any greenery, only plucked petals. It's such a weird experience but is still a very inoffensive yet unique fragrance. It can go into the whole clean/laundry/spa type category of smells but is still the first of its kind I've ever smelled. Way more beautiful and delicate than any of the Margiela sunday morning and bubble bath scents from the mainstream. 

Let me know if any of you have tried these Osmofolia scents and what occasions you like to wear them for! They honestly evoke a lot of emotions for me when I put them on which is really cool, and if there are another interesting scents you would recommend from this house.

1m3huh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1m3huh3/the_life_i_imagined_with_you_both/,The Life I Imagined With You Both,"There’s no real reason for me to write this. And yet, here I am writing to a ghost that breathes, to someone who still walks the earth and yet feels a thousand lifetimes away from me. I don’t know how to stop wanting you. I don’t even mean in that desperate, dramatic way. I mean in the way a body wants air without thinking. In the way flowers lean toward the sun even when they’ve already been stepped on.

You were never mine. But I imagined a life where you were. I imagined it in such detail that sometimes it feels more real than the one I’m actually living in. That life had your name carved into it. Your laugh in the walls. Your clothes on the floor. Your breath warming the back of my neck in the middle of winter. And I ache for it like it was taken from me. But the truth is it was never given. You rejected me. Maybe not with cruelty. But with silence. With hesitation. With the slow retreat of someone who doesn’t see a future where I am standing. And still, I stayed awhile. Just in case. Just in hope.

You have no idea how quietly I loved you. I remember the night I realized you weren’t going to choose me. It wasn’t dramatic. The sky didn’t fall.
The earth didn’t crack. But something in me shifted. Like a door that closed behind me so gently, I didn’t hear it until much later. I think grief is quieter when it has no beginning. When it doesn’t come from loss but from absence. From the life that was never held in your hands long enough to drop. I wanted it to be you. I wanted you to be the one I built everything with.
Not because I thought you were perfect, no. But because your imperfections felt like puzzles I wanted to spend the rest of my life solving.

You had this fire in you. A softness too. And I saw something sacred in that contrast. You were the kind of complicated I could’ve studied for decades and never gotten bored.
You were mystery and comfort.
You were chaos and calm. You were the feeling of coming home to someone who still makes your heart race.

And maybe I romanticized you too much. But if you’d have let me, I would’ve shown you a kind of love that didn’t ask you to be perfect. Only present. Only honest. Only trying. I would’ve met you there… I would’ve built something you could’ve believed in. Something with roots. Something that didn’t flinch when things got hard. But you didn’t want that. You didn’t want me. And that truth cuts quieter now, but it still cuts.

There are places I pass now that make me think of you. Not because we went there together. But because I once imagined us there. There’s a coffee shop I used to visit alone. And in my head, you were sitting across from me, stealing sips from my drink, your leg brushing mine under the table, your eyes tired but soft. And I’d think this is what I want. Not fireworks. Not grand declarations. Just this. Just you. Existing beside me like it’s the most natural thing in the world.

But that daydream never made it past my skin. You never saw the world I built with you in it. You never stepped inside. And so now it’s just empty rooms in my chest where your laughter never echoed. You once told me his favorite color. It was something simple maybe blue, I think. Or green. I held onto it like a secret, not because it was important in itself, but because it was a part of your world. A thread I could tug on gently, like I was quietly stitching myself closer to you. I never got to meet him. But in my mind, I already knew how to love him.

That’s the part that still gets to me.
You didn’t just say no to me. You said no to the version of me that would’ve shown up not just for you, but for both of you. That soft, steady presence I knew I could be. I pictured it. More times than I care to admit.
Sunday mornings with the smell of waffles in the air. Your son curled up on the couch with my dog’s head resting on his leg. Cartoons humming in the background. You in the kitchen, hair messy, one sock on. Me watching you like I’d never get tired of it. It wasn’t a fantasy, it was a hope. One I held gently. Carefully.
Like a tiny flame I was trying to shield from the wind.

Because I didn’t want just you.
I wanted the version of life where you were all in. Where the three of us made some weird little family that somehow worked. Where your son saw what love looked like when it was quiet and real. Where my dog found a second human to follow around, tail wagging like a metronome for how full the house felt.

Do you know how rare it is to want to love someone and their child? Do you know what it means to imagine building a home, not just for yourself, but for someone else’s heart too?
That was never obligation to me.
It was privilege. It was purpose. And I know I’m romanticizing this.
I know there’s a difference between loving the idea of someone and living the truth of them day after day.

But this wasn’t just some illusion I made up in the fog. This was desire. Rooted. Grounded. Intentional. I didn’t want you because I was lonely.
I wanted you because I saw something worth staying for. Worth building around. Worth protecting.
And you looked at that, at me and said no.

Maybe not directly. Maybe not with words. But your absence spoke loudly. Your retreat was a language I understood all too well. I still remember that one text the one you never answered. I’d asked something simple. Something small. And I waited. And waited. And something inside me wilted just a little more with every hour that passed. That’s the thing about silence. It doesn’t scream. It erodes. And even now, I catch myself wondering if you ever think about it. About me. About what could’ve been if you had just leaned in a little.

What if we’d gone grocery shopping together? What if I’d made your son laugh so hard he spilled juice on the carpet and we both yelled, and then laughed ourselves into the floor?
What if you’d curled up next to me one night and whispered that it felt like home?

You’ll never know how easily I could have stayed.I don’t love easily. Not anymore. I’ve been let down too many times. But with you C … I wanted to risk it. That was the scariest part. You made me want to try again. And maybe that’s why it hurts like this, because I wasn’t grieving someone who hurt me. I was grieving someone who never let me love them.

Grief doesn’t always come with screaming. Sometimes, it shows up in gentle ways. In the way I pause when I see a hoodie like the one you wore. In the way I still hear your voice in songs I know you’ve never heard.

Sometimes, I think grief is just love that has nowhere to go. I try not to think about you too much. But the world makes that difficult. A laugh that sounds like yours on the street.
A spunky kid jumping around in a grocery store aisle. A leash in someone else’s hand, with a dog that looks just like mine. For a second, I pretend it’s us. For a second, the ache is sweet. Then it sharpens. You’re everywhere and nowhere.
Like a ghost who refuses to haunt me properly. Not quite present. Not quite gone.

There are nights when I still catch myself thinking about the way you  kissed me back. Soft at first. Then needy. Like you’d finally exhaled after holding your breath too long. Like you were just as afraid of wanting me as I was of not being wanted. I wanted to met you there.
I would’ve held your fear as gently as your face. I would’ve traced every bruise the past left on your heart, and kissed each one like it meant something sacred. Because it did.
I didn’t want the easy parts of you.
I wanted it all your doubts, your stubbornness, your messy past, your child’s bedtime stories. I wanted your Tuesday mornings and your Sunday sadness. I wanted to be the person who saw your worst and stayed anyway.

But I never got the chance. You saw the edges of me and stepped back.
You never looked long enough to see that I was offering you something real. Something soft. Something rare.
And I get it. I do. Maybe you weren’t ready. Maybe I reminded you of something you didn’t want to feel again. Or maybe you just didn’t want me.

I’ve spun every version of this story in my head. In some, you’re scared. In others, careless. But the hardest ones to live with are the ones where you simply didn’t feel what I felt. There’s no villain in those versions. Just me. Standing in a garden that never bloomed, watering soil that never held your seeds. You were never cruel to me. And maybe that’s why this hurts so much. Because I don’t hate you. Because you just never held my heart..

And so, the pain doesn’t come with rage. It comes with longing. With questions that don’t have answers.
With love letters that will never be sent. Like this one. I write this knowing you’ll probably never read it.
But I also know you live in the folds of my memory like a pressed flower, fragile, beautiful, and already fading at the edges. Still, I keep you. I keep the version of you I once believed in.
The one who might’ve stayed. The one who might’ve let me braid a life with yours. Our days like thread. Our nights like poems. Our hearts, maybe, unafraid.

Some nights, I still make space for you in my dreams. Not by choice, 
more like muscle memory. Like the way my dog finds the spot by the door where you never stood and still curls up there sometimes, as if waiting.

He knew about you, even though you never met. Maybe not your name, but the way my voice softened when I spoke of you. The way I sighed when your name lit up my phone
and exhaled differently when it didn’t. He noticed the shift in the air.
Dogs always do. He’d watch me from across the room when I sat staring at nothing, when I played a song you’d never heard on repeat, when I’d get up halfway through a show and never come back to the couch. He knew I was waiting for someone
who didn’t know how to arrive.

I think that’s what love can become 
a kind of waiting. A holding open of the door, even when no one’s knocking. And I held it open for too long. You were the only one I imagined sharing my quiet with. The mundane. The real. The stillness. The groceries. The shared toothbrush drawer. The way your son would ask for help with homework while my dog dropped a toy at your feet and wagged like he’d never known a day without you. You never let me build that with you. And yet, it’s all still here. In the back of my mind like a film I directed but never got to cast.

Sometimes I picture you barefoot in my kitchen. Hair messy. Shoulders loose. T-shirt too big… maybe mine..
You’re humming something you don’t even realize, and I’m watching from the doorway thinking, this is it. This is everything I never knew I was allowed to want. That image plays on a loop in the part of me that doesn’t care if it’s real anymore. Just that it feels true. You made me want things I’d stopped believing in. You made me imagine softness that stayed. You made me hope again, 
and then left me with it. I used to think heartbreak was loud. That it came with screaming, door slams,
thunder, glass.

But this? This was soft. Like someone turning the volume down on a song just before your favorite part. Like a goodbye whispered from across the street with traffic between you. Like the way someone disappears by simply not showing up. I kept waiting for a moment.
Some grand closure. A sharp edge to wrap this pain around. But you never gave me an ending. Only silence. Only maybe. Only the slow death of something that never fully lived. 

I remember the first things you said to me. The flickers. The things that didn’t feel like anything at the time
but now feel like everything. The way your name looked on my screen. How I started smiling without meaning to. The way your laugh loosened something in my chest
that had been locked up for years.
That’s how it began. Not with fireworks. But with warmth.

You never touched me the way I hoped you would, but I remember the nearness. The way you’d lean in when you talked. The way your eyes softened like maybe, just maybe, you saw me. There were times I thought you might reach for me. Moments stretched out like held breath. But you never did. And I never asked.

We danced around something sacred. Too afraid to call it love.
Too afraid to name a thing that might vanish if spoken out loud. But it was there. In the spaces between. In the way I noticed everything about you.. Not because I was trying to, but because my heart paid attention.

The chipped nail polish. The way your hands moved when you were thinking. How you blinked more when you were nervous. How your voice changed when you talked your son.
How your smile got smaller when you were hiding something. How you looked like you were constantly carrying a weight that no one else could see. I saw you. And I think that terrified you. You were always quick to retreat when things got close.
You’d say something sweet and then vanish for days. You’d share something vulnerable, then act like it never happened. I tried to be patient.
To give you space to breathe. But every time I stepped closer, you pulled away. And every time I stepped back, I hoped you’d follow.
You never did. So I stayed somewhere in the middle. Balancing my hope on the edge of your uncertainty. And I told myself that was enough. That maybe one day, you’d see me standing there and finally reach.

But now I realize you were never reaching. Only drifting. And still, I find myself clinging to the almosts. Because they’re all I have. The conversation that almost turned into something deeper. The glance that almost meant something more. The feeling I almost voiced. The future I almost believed in. I would’ve built a life out of those almosts. Brick by brick. If you had just chosen to stay.
I would’ve loved you softly at first then fiercely. Like wind. Like wildfire.
Like someone who knew that love doesn’t always come dressed in perfection, but in the willingness to stay when it’s easier to run. But you ran. Or maybe you just walked away slowly, hoping I wouldn’t notice until you were already gone.

And still I whisper things to the empty air like you can hear me. I tell you how your absence still echoes. How I still remember the version of you I never got to meet. The one who leaned in. The one who stayed.

Some mornings, I open my eyes and forget, just for a second, that you’re not coming back. That there was never a goodbye. Only your absence,
folding itself into my routines
like it belonged there. My dog wakes me up the same way he always does, soft, patient, expectant. He doesn’t know how heavy mornings have become. Or maybe he does, and just doesn’t say anything. There’s comfort in that. In being seen without being asked to speak.

He doesn’t understand the way I hold onto the memory of someone who never truly arrived. But he understands waiting. He understands staying. He never left.
Not when I cried on the floor. Not when I got quiet. Not when I stopped playing the music I used to show you. He stays. And sometimes, that’s enough to keep me going. There’s something holy in a creature who doesn’t need words to say, I’m still here. I wonder if your son feels that kind of loyalty when he looks at you.
If he knows what it means to be someone’s whole world. Because I was ready to offer him that. To offer you that. But I can’t give what someone won’t take. And that’s what healing looks like lately learning to stop offering myself to someone who keeps their hands in their pockets.

Learning that silence isn’t always a test. Sometimes it’s an answer. I still dream about you. Less frequently now, but when I do, it always hurts in the sweetest way. You’re smiling. You’re laughing at something I said.
And I think this is what it could’ve been. This is what love might’ve looked like if you’d just stayed still long enough to let it bloom. And when I wake up, there’s always a heaviness.

Not the sharp stab of loss but the quiet ache of memory. Of muscle remembering how to reach for something that’s no longer there. Some days I do okay. I go to work. I make my bed. I laugh at a joke I read online. And no one knows that I’m still carrying you in the back pocket of my heart. Other days, I spiral over something as stupid as a song. Or the way the light hits my living room
at exactly the hour you used to text me. You’re not a person anymore.
You’re a feeling. A ripple. A shadow I still flinch toward. And maybe that’s what you were always meant to be 
not a chapter, but a ghost between pages. I still hold you softly. Not out of hope anymore but out of love that has nowhere else to go. I’m not angry. Just hollow in the spaces I made for you.

The seasons have changed since I last seen you. Or since I was yours.
Or since I almost was. Whatever version of the truth fits. Spring turned to summer. The flowers bloomed and died. And somewhere in the middle,
I stopped checking my phone. Not because I don’t think of you. But because I had to stop hoping you’d think of me. There’s something so cruel about the way the earth keeps turning, even when your heart is stuck.

The wanting doesn’t leave. It just changes shape. Like fog lifting slowly. Still damp. Still clinging. But less blinding. I sometimes wonder if the trees remember me from when I whispered your name into the wind.
From when I paused beneath their branches and imagined your laugh bouncing between them. I used to daydream about you walking beside me. Your son chasing leaves ahead of us. My dog tugging at the leash, thrilled by the noise, the air, the life.
We’d get coffee. He’d want chocolate milk. You’d steal a sip from my cup and smile without apology. And I’d think this is it. This is what they mean when they talk about peace. But seasons pass. Dreams fade. Leaves fall.

And not everything comes back in spring. I’m still learning how to let you be something that happened to me
and not something I failed to protect.
Because I still wonder if I could’ve done more. If I should’ve fought harder. If I should’ve told you how deep it really went. But then I remember that I did. I showed up. I stayed soft. I stood there with my hands open while you carried your silence like a shield. And that’s not on me. The hardest part of healing is admitting that you were given a choice and you didn’t choose me.
That you looked at all I was willing to give, and turned away.

Even now, on warm days when the sun hits just right, I swear I can feel the ghost of the life I wanted. A flash. A flicker. Your son’s laughter, my dog’s bark, your voice saying, “Let’s just stay here a little longer.” But I’m alone on the porch. My coffee’s gone cold. And your voice is only memory now. Still, I hold it gently. Because even if I never got the ending, you were the first story I wanted to write
without leaving any pages blank.

There’s a version of me in some parallel thread of time, where you stayed. Where your yes was quiet but sure. Where your fears showed up, but so did your hands. And they reached for mine. In that world, I am not writing this letter. I’m asleep in a bed warmed by your breath. Your son is dreaming down the hall. My dog has curled into the crook of your knees. And the house is quiet not from absence, but from peace. I visit that version of us sometimes. In sleep. In daydreams. In the way my soul detaches from this reality just long enough to imagine what it felt like to be chosen by you.

And I hold that version gently. Like a snow globe. A world I can shake and stare into, even though I’ll never step inside. Do you feel it, too? The echo of the life we didn’t live? Maybe when you walk past someone who wears my scent. Or when your son says something you didn’t realize I once said. Or when the night is too quiet
and your mind begins to wander toward what if. I wonder if there are moments where your heart stutters for no reason and it’s me. My name never said aloud, but felt like a chill in a warm room. There are versions of us in every shadow. The one where we met sooner. The one where you were ready. The one where I didn’t have to prove my love by standing in place while you vanished over and over again.

In one, you call me “home.” Not just in the poetic sense but in the way people call out when they walk in the door and expect to be held. In another, you teach your son how to trust, and I show him how loyalty looks when it comes wrapped in fur and silence and the soft weight of a dog who listens without question. In one, we fight. We cry. But we don’t run. And the storm passes. And you say, “Let’s fix it. Let’s try again. That’s the one I live in most. It’s the most human. The most possible. The one that feels the cruelest, too because we were almost that close. But we didn’t make it. We were a constellation that never aligned. A song that skipped before the chorus. And now, I live in a version of reality where you are not mine.

Where your silence is louder than any goodbye. Where I feed my dog, walk him through our routine, and he doesn’t know that I imagined your son feeding him treats by hand. That I imagined teaching both of them how to sit, how to stay, how to love without condition. I don’t live there anymore in the life we never built. But I visit. And when I do, I leave flowers at the doorstep of the home I once dreamed we’d grow old in. There’s something sacred about loving someone who never let you love them back. Not noble. Not selfless. Just… sacred. Like planting a garden
even when you know winter is coming too soon.

I still think about you.Not every day anymore. But enough that it still surprises me how grief can become background noise, a hum beneath the rhythm of life. You taught me that. Without trying. Without knowing. You taught me that I can love without being asked to. That my heart can offer something whole
even when it’s not received. That showing up matters even if I’m the only one standing in the rain. I don’t regret loving you. I don’t regret the hope. I don’t regret the way I pictured your son with my dog, the way I imagined kissing your forehead after a long day, the way I dreamed of holidays that felt like healing. What I grieve now isn’t just you. It’s the version of me I became when I believed in us. The soft one. The open one.The one who stood barefoot in the doorway of my own heart and said, come in. Stay. I’ll make space.

That version of me still lives here,
somewhere underneath the bruises. She’s quieter now. But she survived.
And maybe that’s what this was meant to be a reminder that I still know how to love like that. Even after everything. Even without you. There is beauty in things left unfinished. Not everything is meant to be tied up in a bow. Some stories end mid-sentence. Some people leave before the poem is done.

And that doesn’t make the lines I wrote for you any less true. Any less beautiful. You will always be a chapter I wanted to keep writing. A door I would’ve kept open. A hand I would’ve held until my own grew old. But now I write for myself again.Now I hold my own hand in the dark.
Now I walk the dog alone, but I do it with a heart that knows it was brave enough to try. Brave enough to dream. Brave enough to love without a guarantee. You didn’t choose me. But I chose love. And in the end, that’s something I get to carry forward. You told me you didn’t feel the way I felt. You said you still wanted to be friends and I know you meant it gently. But even gentle words can land like breaking glass
when you’ve built your heart around someone. I didn’t know how to be “just friends” with someone I had already imagined building a life with.
I didn’t know how to shrink my love into something casual, to unthread the quiet dreams I’d sewn around you. So I stayed quiet. I stepped back. Not to punish you but to protect what was left of me.

And maybe you don’t understand that. Maybe to you, it looks like distance. But to me, it’s grace. It’s learning not to reach for someone
who doesn’t reach back with the same kind of hunger. I still think of you. Like longing, or peace that hasn’t fully arrived. You’re a name I don’t say out loud anymore. But you still live in the spaces between songs, in certain kinds of weather,
in the way my dog perks up at the door sometimes as if he remembers the idea of you before you ever became real. You’re still here, in some unspoken way. And maybe that’s enough right now. Not a clean goodbye. Not a promise to wait.
Just… this. This letter I’m writing with no one to send it to, but with all of me in it. If you ever wonder if I cared, if I meant it, if I was serious when I said I wanted you.. You don’t have to ask.

It’s written everywhere. In how I speak your name in my own head. In how I carry the love you didn’t return. In how I still wish you well from this quiet distance. And maybe, in some different life, we made it work. Maybe we sat side by side at the end of a long day, watching your son and my dog curled up on the floor like they’d always belonged together. Maybe you leaned your head on my shoulder and said, “Thank you for not giving up on me.” But for now, I’ll just keep walking forward. Not away from you. Just toward myself. And if you ever find your way back not out of guilt, not out of loneliness, but because something deep inside you finally knows what I was offering I’ll still be me. Softer. Wiser. Still loving you in ways you may never fully understand.

There’s no real reason for me to write this. And yet, here I am writing to a ghost that breathes, to someone who still walks the earth and yet feels a thousand lifetimes away from me. I don’t know how to stop wanting you. I don’t even mean in that desperate, dramatic way. I mean in the way a body wants air without thinking. In the way flowers lean toward the sun even when they’ve already been stepped on.

You were never mine. But I imagined a life where you were. I imagined it in such detail that sometimes it feels more real than the one I’m actually living in. That life had your name carved into it. Your laugh in the walls. Your clothes on the floor. Your breath warming the back of my neck in the middle of winter. And I ache for it like it was taken from me. But the truth is it was never given. You rejected me. Maybe not with cruelty. But with silence. With hesitation. With the slow retreat of someone who doesn’t see a future where I am standing. And still, I stayed awhile. Just in case. Just in hope.

You have no idea how quietly I loved you. I remember the night I realized you weren’t going to choose me. It wasn’t dramatic. The sky didn’t fall.
The earth didn’t crack. But something in me shifted. Like a door that closed behind me so gently, I didn’t hear it until much later. I think grief is quieter when it has no beginning. When it doesn’t come from loss but from absence. From the life that was never held in your hands long enough to drop. I wanted it to be you. I wanted you to be the one I built everything with.
Not because I thought you were perfect, no. But because your imperfections felt like puzzles I wanted to spend the rest of my life solving.

You had this fire in you. A softness too. And I saw something sacred in that contrast. You were the kind of complicated I could’ve studied for decades and never gotten bored.
You were mystery and comfort.
You were chaos and calm. You were the feeling of coming home to someone who still makes your heart race.

And maybe I romanticized you too much. But if you’d have let me, I would’ve shown you a kind of love that didn’t ask you to be perfect. Only present. Only honest. Only trying. I would’ve met you there… I would’ve built something you could’ve believed in. Something with roots. Something that didn’t flinch when things got hard. But you didn’t want that. You didn’t want me. And that truth cuts quieter now, but it still cuts.

There are places I pass now that make me think of you. Not because we went there together. But because I once imagined us there. There’s a coffee shop I used to visit alone. And in my head, you were sitting across from me, stealing sips from my drink, your leg brushing mine under the table, your eyes tired but soft. And I’d think this is what I want. Not fireworks. Not grand declarations. Just this. Just you. Existing beside me like it’s the most natural thing in the world.

But that daydream never made it past my skin. You never saw the world I built with you in it. You never stepped inside. And so now it’s just empty rooms in my chest where your laughter never echoed. You once told me his favorite color. It was something simple maybe blue, I think. Or green. I held onto it like a secret, not because it was important in itself, but because it was a part of your world. A thread I could tug on gently, like I was quietly stitching myself closer to you. I never got to meet him. But in my mind, I already knew how to love him.

That’s the part that still gets to me.
You didn’t just say no to me. You said no to the version of me that would’ve shown up not just for you, but for both of you. That soft, steady presence I knew I could be. I pictured it. More times than I care to admit.
Sunday mornings with the smell of waffles in the air. Your son curled up on the couch with my dog’s head resting on his leg. Cartoons humming in the background. You in the kitchen, hair messy, one sock on. Me watching you like I’d never get tired of it. It wasn’t a fantasy, it was a hope. One I held gently. Carefully.
Like a tiny flame I was trying to shield from the wind.

Because I didn’t want just you.
I wanted the version of life where you were all in. Where the three of us made some weird little family that somehow worked. Where your son saw what love looked like when it was quiet and real. Where my dog found a second human to follow around, tail wagging like a metronome for how full the house felt.

Do you know how rare it is to want to love someone and their child? Do you know what it means to imagine building a home, not just for yourself, but for someone else’s heart too?
That was never obligation to me.
It was privilege. It was purpose. And I know I’m romanticizing this.
I know there’s a difference between loving the idea of someone and living the truth of them day after day.

But this wasn’t just some illusion I made up in the fog. This was desire. Rooted. Grounded. Intentional. I didn’t want you because I was lonely.
I wanted you because I saw something worth staying for. Worth building around. Worth protecting.
And you looked at that, at me and said no.

Maybe not directly. Maybe not with words. But your absence spoke loudly. Your retreat was a language I understood all too well. I still remember that one text the one you never answered. I’d asked something simple. Something small. And I waited. And waited. And something inside me wilted just a little more with every hour that passed. That’s the thing about silence. It doesn’t scream. It erodes. And even now, I catch myself wondering if you ever think about it. About me. About what could’ve been if you had just leaned in a little.

What if we’d gone grocery shopping together? What if I’d made your son laugh so hard he spilled juice on the carpet and we both yelled, and then laughed ourselves into the floor?
What if you’d curled up next to me one night and whispered that it felt like home?

You’ll never know how easily I could have stayed.I don’t love easily. Not anymore. I’ve been let down too many times. But with you C … I wanted to risk it. That was the scariest part. You made me want to try again. And maybe that’s why it hurts like this, because I wasn’t grieving someone who hurt me. I was grieving someone who never let me love them.

Grief doesn’t always come with screaming. Sometimes, it shows up in gentle ways. In the way I pause when I see a hoodie like the one you wore. In the way I still hear your voice in songs I know you’ve never heard.

Sometimes, I think grief is just love that has nowhere to go. I try not to think about you too much. But the world makes that difficult. A laugh that sounds like yours on the street.
A spunky kid jumping around in a grocery store aisle. A leash in someone else’s hand, with a dog that looks just like mine. For a second, I pretend it’s us. For a second, the ache is sweet. Then it sharpens. You’re everywhere and nowhere.
Like a ghost who refuses to haunt me properly. Not quite present. Not quite gone.

There are nights when I still catch myself thinking about the way you  kissed me back. Soft at first. Then needy. Like you’d finally exhaled after holding your breath too long. Like you were just as afraid of wanting me as I was of not being wanted. I wanted to met you there.
I would’ve held your fear as gently as your face. I would’ve traced every bruise the past left on your heart, and kissed each one like it meant something sacred. Because it did.
I didn’t want the easy parts of you.
I wanted it all your doubts, your stubbornness, your messy past, your child’s bedtime stories. I wanted your Tuesday mornings and your Sunday sadness. I wanted to be the person who saw your worst and stayed anyway.

But I never got the chance. You saw the edges of me and stepped back.
You never looked long enough to see that I was offering you something real. Something soft. Something rare.
And I get it. I do. Maybe you weren’t ready. Maybe I reminded you of something you didn’t want to feel again. Or maybe you just didn’t want me.

I’ve spun every version of this story in my head. In some, you’re scared. In others, careless. But the hardest ones to live with are the ones where you simply didn’t feel what I felt. There’s no villain in those versions. Just me. Standing in a garden that never bloomed, watering soil that never held your seeds. You were never cruel to me. And maybe that’s why this hurts so much. Because I don’t hate you. Because you just never held my heart..

And so, the pain doesn’t come with rage. It comes with longing. With questions that don’t have answers.
With love letters that will never be sent. Like this one. I write this knowing you’ll probably never read it.
But I also know you live in the folds of my memory like a pressed flower, fragile, beautiful, and already fading at the edges. Still, I keep you. I keep the version of you I once believed in.
The one who might’ve stayed. The one who might’ve let me braid a life with yours. Our days like thread. Our nights like poems. Our hearts, maybe, unafraid.

Some nights, I still make space for you in my dreams. Not by choice, 
more like muscle memory. Like the way my dog finds the spot by the door where you never stood and still curls up there sometimes, as if waiting.

He knew about you, even though you never met. Maybe not your name, but the way my voice softened when I spoke of you. The way I sighed when your name lit up my phone
and exhaled differently when it didn’t. He noticed the shift in the air.
Dogs always do. He’d watch me from across the room when I sat staring at nothing, when I played a song you’d never heard on repeat, when I’d get up halfway through a show and never come back to the couch. He knew I was waiting for someone
who didn’t know how to arrive.

I think that’s what love can become 
a kind of waiting. A holding open of the door, even when no one’s knocking. And I held it open for too long. You were the only one I imagined sharing my quiet with. The mundane. The real. The stillness. The groceries. The shared toothbrush drawer. The way your son would ask for help with homework while my dog dropped a toy at your feet and wagged like he’d never known a day without you. You never let me build that with you. And yet, it’s all still here. In the back of my mind like a film I directed but never got to cast.

Sometimes I picture you barefoot in my kitchen. Hair messy. Shoulders loose. T-shirt too big… maybe mine..
You’re humming something you don’t even realize, and I’m watching from the doorway thinking, this is it. This is everything I never knew I was allowed to want. That image plays on a loop in the part of me that doesn’t care if it’s real anymore. Just that it feels true. You made me want things I’d stopped believing in. You made me imagine softness that stayed. You made me hope again, 
and then left me with it. I used to think heartbreak was loud. That it came with screaming, door slams,
thunder, glass.

But this? This was soft. Like someone turning the volume down on a song just before your favorite part. Like a goodbye whispered from across the street with traffic between you. Like the way someone disappears by simply not showing up. I kept waiting for a moment.
Some grand closure. A sharp edge to wrap this pain around. But you never gave me an ending. Only silence. Only maybe. Only the slow death of something that never fully lived. 

I remember the first things you said to me. The flickers. The things that didn’t feel like anything at the time
but now feel like everything. The way your name looked on my screen. How I started smiling without meaning to. The way your laugh loosened something in my chest
that had been locked up for years.
That’s how it began. Not with fireworks. But with warmth.

You never touched me the way I hoped you would, but I remember the nearness. The way you’d lean in when you talked. The way your eyes softened like maybe, just maybe, you saw me. There were times I thought you might reach for me. Moments stretched out like held breath. But you never did. And I never asked.

We danced around something sacred. Too afraid to call it love.
Too afraid to name a thing that might vanish if spoken out loud. But it was there. In the spaces between. In the way I noticed everything about you.. Not because I was trying to, but because my heart paid attention.

The chipped nail polish. The way your hands moved when you were thinking. How you blinked more when you were nervous. How your voice changed when you talked your son.
How your smile got smaller when you were hiding something. How you looked like you were constantly carrying a weight that no one else could see. I saw you. And I think that terrified you. You were always quick to retreat when things got close.
You’d say something sweet and then vanish for days. You’d share something vulnerable, then act like it never happened. I tried to be patient.
To give you space to breathe. But every time I stepped closer, you pulled away. And every time I stepped back, I hoped you’d follow.
You never did. So I stayed somewhere in the middle. Balancing my hope on the edge of your uncertainty. And I told myself that was enough. That maybe one day, you’d see me standing there and finally reach.

But now I realize you were never reaching. Only drifting. And still, I find myself clinging to the almosts. Because they’re all I have. The conversation that almost turned into something deeper. The glance that almost meant something more. The feeling I almost voiced. The future I almost believed in. I would’ve built a life out of those almosts. Brick by brick. If you had just chosen to stay.
I would’ve loved you softly at first then fiercely. Like wind. Like wildfire.
Like someone who knew that love doesn’t always come dressed in perfection, but in the willingness to stay when it’s easier to run. But you ran. Or maybe you just walked away slowly, hoping I wouldn’t notice until you were already gone.

And still I whisper things to the empty air like you can hear me. I tell you how your absence still echoes. How I still remember the version of you I never got to meet. The one who leaned in. The one who stayed.

Some mornings, I open my eyes and forget, just for a second, that you’re not coming back. That there was never a goodbye. Only your absence,
folding itself into my routines
like it belonged there. My dog wakes me up the same way he always does, soft, patient, expectant. He doesn’t know how heavy mornings have become. Or maybe he does, and just doesn’t say anything. There’s comfort in that. In being seen without being asked to speak.

He doesn’t understand the way I hold onto the memory of someone who never truly arrived. But he understands waiting. He understands staying. He never left.
Not when I cried on the floor. Not when I got quiet. Not when I stopped playing the music I used to show you. He stays. And sometimes, that’s enough to keep me going. There’s something holy in a creature who doesn’t need words to say, I’m still here. I wonder if your son feels that kind of loyalty when he looks at you.
If he knows what it means to be someone’s whole world. Because I was ready to offer him that. To offer you that. But I can’t give what someone won’t take. And that’s what healing looks like lately learning to stop offering myself to someone who keeps their hands in their pockets.

Learning that silence isn’t always a test. Sometimes it’s an answer. I still dream about you. Less frequently now, but when I do, it always hurts in the sweetest way. You’re smiling. You’re laughing at something I said.
And I think this is what it could’ve been. This is what love might’ve looked like if you’d just stayed still long enough to let it bloom. And when I wake up, there’s always a heaviness.

Not the sharp stab of loss but the quiet ache of memory. Of muscle remembering how to reach for something that’s no longer there. Some days I do okay. I go to work. I make my bed. I laugh at a joke I read online. And no one knows that I’m still carrying you in the back pocket of my heart. Other days, I spiral over something as stupid as a song. Or the way the light hits my living room
at exactly the hour you used to text me. You’re not a person anymore.
You’re a feeling. A ripple. A shadow I still flinch toward. And maybe that’s what you were always meant to be 
not a chapter, but a ghost between pages. I still hold you softly. Not out of hope anymore but out of love that has nowhere else to go. I’m not angry. Just hollow in the spaces I made for you.

The seasons have changed since I last seen you. Or since I was yours.
Or since I almost was. Whatever version of the truth fits. Spring turned to summer. The flowers bloomed and died. And somewhere in the middle,
I stopped checking my phone. Not because I don’t think of you. But because I had to stop hoping you’d think of me. There’s something so cruel about the way the earth keeps turning, even when your heart is stuck.

The wanting doesn’t leave. It just changes shape. Like fog lifting slowly. Still damp. Still clinging. But less blinding. I sometimes wonder if the trees remember me from when I whispered your name into the wind.
From when I paused beneath their branches and imagined your laugh bouncing between them. I used to daydream about you walking beside me. Your son chasing leaves ahead of us. My dog tugging at the leash, thrilled by the noise, the air, the life.
We’d get coffee. He’d want chocolate milk. You’d steal a sip from my cup and smile without apology. And I’d think this is it. This is what they mean when they talk about peace. But seasons pass. Dreams fade. Leaves fall.

And not everything comes back in spring. I’m still learning how to let you be something that happened to me
and not something I failed to protect.
Because I still wonder if I could’ve done more. If I should’ve fought harder. If I should’ve told you how deep it really went. But then I remember that I did. I showed up. I stayed soft. I stood there with my hands open while you carried your silence like a shield. And that’s not on me. The hardest part of healing is admitting that you were given a choice and you didn’t choose me.
That you looked at all I was willing to give, and turned away.

Even now, on warm days when the sun hits just right, I swear I can feel the ghost of the life I wanted. A flash. A flicker. Your son’s laughter, my dog’s bark, your voice saying, “Let’s just stay here a little longer.” But I’m alone on the porch. My coffee’s gone cold. And your voice is only memory now. Still, I hold it gently. Because even if I never got the ending, you were the first story I wanted to write
without leaving any pages blank.

There’s a version of me in some parallel thread of time, where you stayed. Where your yes was quiet but sure. Where your fears showed up, but so did your hands. And they reached for mine. In that world, I am not writing this letter. I’m asleep in a bed warmed by your breath. Your son is dreaming down the hall. My dog has curled into the crook of your knees. And the house is quiet not from absence, but from peace. I visit that version of us sometimes. In sleep. In daydreams. In the way my soul detaches from this reality just long enough to imagine what it felt like to be chosen by you.

And I hold that version gently. Like a snow globe. A world I can shake and stare into, even though I’ll never step inside. Do you feel it, too? The echo of the life we didn’t live? Maybe when you walk past someone who wears my scent. Or when your son says something you didn’t realize I once said. Or when the night is too quiet
and your mind begins to wander toward what if. I wonder if there are moments where your heart stutters for no reason and it’s me. My name never said aloud, but felt like a chill in a warm room. There are versions of us in every shadow. The one where we met sooner. The one where you were ready. The one where I didn’t have to prove my love by standing in place while you vanished over and over again.

In one, you call me “home.” Not just in the poetic sense but in the way people call out when they walk in the door and expect to be held. In another, you teach your son how to trust, and I show him how loyalty looks when it comes wrapped in fur and silence and the soft weight of a dog who listens without question. In one, we fight. We cry. But we don’t run. And the storm passes. And you say, “Let’s fix it. Let’s try again. That’s the one I live in most. It’s the most human. The most possible. The one that feels the cruelest, too because we were almost that close. But we didn’t make it. We were a constellation that never aligned. A song that skipped before the chorus. And now, I live in a version of reality where you are not mine.

Where your silence is louder than any goodbye. Where I feed my dog, walk him through our routine, and he doesn’t know that I imagined your son feeding him treats by hand. That I imagined teaching both of them how to sit, how to stay, how to love without condition. I don’t live there anymore in the life we never built. But I visit. And when I do, I leave flowers at the doorstep of the home I once dreamed we’d grow old in. There’s something sacred about loving someone who never let you love them back. Not noble. Not selfless. Just… sacred. Like planting a garden
even when you know winter is coming too soon.

I still think about you.Not every day anymore. But enough that it still surprises me how grief can become background noise, a hum beneath the rhythm of life. You taught me that. Without trying. Without knowing. You taught me that I can love without being asked to. That my heart can offer something whole
even when it’s not received. That showing up matters even if I’m the only one standing in the rain. I don’t regret loving you. I don’t regret the hope. I don’t regret the way I pictured your son with my dog, the way I imagined kissing your forehead after a long day, the way I dreamed of holidays that felt like healing. What I grieve now isn’t just you. It’s the version of me I became when I believed in us. The soft one. The open one.The one who stood barefoot in the doorway of my own heart and said, come in. Stay. I’ll make space.

That version of me still lives here,
somewhere underneath the bruises. She’s quieter now. But she survived.
And maybe that’s what this was meant to be a reminder that I still know how to love like that. Even after everything. Even without you. There is beauty in things left unfinished. Not everything is meant to be tied up in a bow. Some stories end mid-sentence. Some people leave before the poem is done.

And that doesn’t make the lines I wrote for you any less true. Any less beautiful. You will always be a chapter I wanted to keep writing. A door I would’ve kept open. A hand I would’ve held until my own grew old. But now I write for myself again.Now I hold my own hand in the dark.
Now I walk the dog alone, but I do it with a heart that knows it was brave enough to try. Brave enough to dream. Brave enough to love without a guarantee. You didn’t choose me. But I chose love. And in the end, that’s something I get to carry forward. You told me you didn’t feel the way I felt. You said you still wanted to be friends and I know you meant it gently. But even gentle words can land like breaking glass
when you’ve built your heart around someone. I didn’t know how to be “just friends” with someone I had already imagined building a life with.
I didn’t know how to shrink my love into something casual, to unthread the quiet dreams I’d sewn around you. So I stayed quiet. I stepped back. Not to punish you but to protect what was left of me.

And maybe you don’t understand that. Maybe to you, it looks like distance. But to me, it’s grace. It’s learning not to reach for someone
who doesn’t reach back with the same kind of hunger. I still think of you. Like longing, or peace that hasn’t fully arrived. You’re a name I don’t say out loud anymore. But you still live in the spaces between songs, in certain kinds of weather,
in the way my dog perks up at the door sometimes as if he remembers the idea of you before you ever became real. You’re still here, in some unspoken way. And maybe that’s enough right now. Not a clean goodbye. Not a promise to wait.
Just… this. This letter I’m writing with no one to send it to, but with all of me in it. If you ever wonder if I cared, if I meant it, if I was serious when I said I wanted you.. You don’t have to ask.

It’s written everywhere. In how I speak your name in my own head. In how I carry the love you didn’t return. In how I still wish you well from this quiet distance. And maybe, in some different life, we made it work. Maybe we sat side by side at the end of a long day, watching your son and my dog curled up on the floor like they’d always belonged together. Maybe you leaned your head on my shoulder and said, “Thank you for not giving up on me.” But for now, I’ll just keep walking forward. Not away from you. Just toward myself. And if you ever find your way back not out of guilt, not out of loneliness, but because something deep inside you finally knows what I was offering I’ll still be me. Softer. Wiser. Still loving you in ways you may never fully understand.

I’m a 23F, 5’5”, Indo-Caribbean, who moved to Vancouver 5 years ago. A boring accountant by day and introvert recharging at home by night.

On a more serious note, I’m hoping to have a good conversation, one that doesn’t feel like an interview.  Would be great to have basic personal hygiene covered, the ability to make dining/coffee and takeout decisions and down to binge watch our favorite shows on rainy days.

When they refund you, that money you paid in fees and tips does not get refunded or reduced. So while you may never decide to pay $5 service fee + $5 driver tip to have a $4 coffee delivered to you, you may pay that amount to have the coffee plus a big meal or multiple small items delivered.

What is crooked is that they take away your ability to choose to pay their fee for the items you wind up with when the item is automatically refunded. You are stuck and they will not cancel an order when it has already been accepted by the restaurant.

I read that Book Loft FFM was a repackaging of Musk No 3, so I brought it home and tested one on each arm. While it’s very similar, it doesn’t have the creaminess of No 3. The bergamot and neroli give it a sharper smell. It projects way more than 3, too. Now that I’ve let it sit, there’s an artificial smell on the dry-down of Book Loft I’m not too sure about.

I went in thinking I would get Vanilla Cafe for another one of my rewards, but the Vanilla Ease caught me off guard in a good way! The lavender really wasn’t as in your face as I thought it would be, and it has a certain creaminess to it. Cafe had me thinking I would smell like I spilled coffee on myself. Nice, but I preferred it in a hand soap. Used a free travel size coupon on a VE mini FFM. 

Settled on the Rich Espresso mist for reward #2. A great clear, pure coffee scent that will layer great with other scents. Looking forward to using it paired with Milk for my own version of Vanilla Cafe. 

Loved most of the new fall soaps but only picked up Honey Wildflower, Fresh Fall Morning, White Pumpkin (love), Vanilla Cafe, and Book Loft.

*This will be a long analysis of my interpretation of the relationship between Clark Kent and Lana Lang throughout the series, recognizing it's flaws and adressing it's qualities. Since this post is going to be quite long, I will be separating my points into topics to make it easier to follow. I know this is usually a hot topic of discussion,* *so whether you agree or disagree, feel free to join the discussion — just please keep it respectful.*

**Clana**

I think it's safe to say that the general opinion regarding this pairing is not the best, both inside and out of Smallville's fandom (appearently, there's television websites putting them on a tier list of worst couples or whatever). While the most common fans' criticism I see about their romantic arc is that it's ""badly written"" or it just turns into people vilifying and hating on Lana for a multitude of different reasons, I'd argue that their relationship is not only full of depth and meaning, but also essential to Clark's journey toward becoming Superman.

I'm also of the opinion that despite its best qualities, this relationship is largely trashed by the community in a way that somewhat detracts from the nuance of it and ignores the many unforgettable moments between these two characters that are layered with real human connection, character growth, and thematic resonance. There are many factors that contribute to my understanding of Clark and Lana's relationship, and why I think it deserves more credit — and compassion. But in order to talk about them and properly analyse the relationship itself, I want to first talk about each of these two characters individually a little bit.

**Lana Lang**

Love her or hate her, Lana is a pretty popular character within the fandom (and I'd argue she's one of the most misunderstood also). She starts off as the classic “girl next door” trope — attractive, kind, and caught in the orbit of both Clark and Whitney. But as the series progresses, she becomes a pillar of support for Clark throughout the story, such as offering him emotional comfort and also even helping him to resolve a major conflict in many episodes. In many ways, she also goes through her own coming-of-age journey to find herself (just like Clark). And yes, some of her questionable decisions are part of it. Lana's character was never written to be perfect. Like all the characters in this show, she's an imperfect human being; she possesses strenghts and flaws just like everyone else. Her flaws are part of what make her human.

When looking at Lana through the lens of classic character archetypes, I believe that she falls into the Lover archetype.

In Jungian psychology, the Lover possesses a great capacity for relating, emotional openness, and a desire for connection with others. But like all archetypes, Lana possesses a *Shadow,* Jung's interpretation of someone's repressed ID or inner blindspot that contradicts their outward Ego. When unbalanced, the Lover tends to struggle with codependency, idealisation and an inability to set healthy boundaries.

Lana is not a hard character to understand (at least in theory). Her motivation is pretty simple; she wants to maintain deep connections with the people she loves in order to build a sense of home and emotional permanency, particularly following her early childhood trauma. Her fatal flaw is in her need to be useful, to be needed, and the self-sacrifice she is willing to enact in order to facilitate that.

This can be seen multiple times in her relationship with Clark, and might be a pattern of behavior stemming from her past. Since Lana already lost most of her family once, she is going to do everything in her power not to lose the people she cares about again.

Unlike Clark, Lana was raised without her parents since she was 3 years old, after they died in the meteor shower, and her only guardian was her aunt. She learned to be independant from a young age; running a coffee business on her own by the age of 16 and managing her studies at the same time is no small feat. But she also craved having someone to look out for her, and for a time, that person was her aunt Nell, and then it was whoever she was dating at the moment (until eventually, of course, Clark became this person).

Lana's desire to feel safe and emotionally anchored is both her greatest strength and the root of many of her challenges. As she grows older, the tension between her independence and her longing for emotional security becomes more apparent. It's not that Lana is weak (far from it), but her need to be needed sometimes clouds her judgment, especially when she seeks that sense of belonging in people who cannot or will not offer it fully (Clark being the most obvious example).

**Clark Kent**

Identifying Clark’s character archetype was a bit harder than Lana's, because he possesses qualities and characteristics of multiple archetypes, and although the most obvious one for him would be The Hero, I don’t believe he fully embodies that archetype until much later in the series — arguably not until Season 8. Instead, the archetype that resonates most with Clark is actually *The Innocent*, especially when you take into consideration his journey since the first season. So, my conclusion is that Clark was The Innocent on his way to become The Hero.

Let me explain why this makes sense:

The Innocent archetype craves happiness, not only for themselves, but for everyone around them, and possesses a deep desire to make the world a better place. They have a firm moral code unique to their own beliefs, and a strong impulse to do what they believe is right. Though sometimes shy, The Innocent's charisma and earnestness endears them to others, even if they aren't aware of it. They are deep thinkers, strong feelers, sensitive and empathetic, with a core belief that people are generally good. Often yet to truly find themselves, The Innocent has much more inner strenght than even they may be aware of. But like all the archetypes, The Innocent has pitfalls, and a *Shadow*.

Experience with hurt and disappointment prompts The Innocent to develop defence mechanisms to prevent further pain. They often have a hard time forgiving mistakes, both their own and others' (reminds me of all the times Clark would retreat into himself whenever he failed to save someone in any way and how he would react in a volatile way when he faced some kind of betrayal or heartbreak). They have a tendency to daydream and wallow in negativity rather than take control of their life, which can lead to insecurity or victim complex (which sounds *exactly* how Clark was in the earlier seasons, especially seasons 1-3).

And above all else, The Innocent fears being rejected or abandoned, and may develop unhealthy strategies to avoid that fear being realised (reminds me of Clark's constant lying and gaslighting the people he cares about to avoid them of the truth about his secret, fearing they would distance themselves from him, be afraid of him or abandon him, especially when it came to Lana, since he felt guilty for arriving in Smallville along with the meteor shower that killed her parents).

Now, the last part of this I think sounded oddly similar to the flaws we discussed with Lana's archetype. That's because they are similar. Especially in terms of their desires and fears, but their fundamental difference is in how they go about achieving those desires and avoiding those fears. Like real people, both Clark and Lana are full of contradictions. Lana possesses a fierce desire for independence and to self-actualise, but she also needs an emotional anchor. For example, after Clark breaks her heart once again in Season 5, and Lana distances herself from him, Lex becomes her new anchor.

Clark, on the other hand, protects connection by maintaining control. His fear of abandonment leads him to hide or distort the truth, believing that honesty will push people away — especially the people he loves most. Instead of reaching out, he often retracts inward. His instinct is to protect others from the truth of who he is, not realizing that this protective instinct is what ultimately drives people away. His withholding is not rooted in selfishness, but in fear — fear that his alien side will render him unlovable, that his powers will make him a danger to those around him, or that his presence in someone’s life will only bring suffering.

**The Relationship Arc**

Now that we have summed up the information about who these characters are, keeping in mind their desires and fears, let's examine their relationship chronologically:

* **Seasons 1–3**: Ever since the first meteor shower, Clark was taken in by the Kents and lived next to Lana's house, who lived with her aunt. Clark’s feelings for Lana are clear, but he was literally unable to get close to her because of her kryptonite necklace. So although they knew each other since they were toddlers, they never actually became friends until high school. It's unclear at what point Lana and Whitney started dating, but in Clark's freshman year of high school (when Season 1 starts), they were already together. At that point, Clark was close friends with Pete and Chloe, the latter having a crush on Clark. Around this time, Clark and Lana grew closer, although Clark's friendship with Chloe was starting to develop into something more. 
* If I'm not mistaken, Lana tells Clark in Season 5 that ever since the first time she saw him (when they were little kids, presumably), she knew no one would make her happier. So I don't know if this is a continuity error from the writers or if it implies that Lana actually always had a crush on Clark too. But even if she did, I get the impression that she wasn't aware of it until they became close friends throughout Season 1. Clark starting to take Chloe more seriously coincides with Whitney joining the military and being long distance with Lana (when their relationship was already close to it's end), and I can't help but wonder if those things were related. 
* There are some scenes toward the end of Season 1 in which Lana seems jealous of Clark and Chloe's interactions. So perhaps, Clark becoming unavailable for the first time and showing interest in somebody else forced Lana to reckon with her feelings in a way that disrupted her relationship with Whitney. Clark, meanwhile, decided to shoot his shot with Chloe because he didn't think there was ever a chance anything would ever happen between him and Lana, all at once because Lana was already in a relationship, Clark may not have known if she would reciprocate his feelings and Clark had, quite honestly, a pretty poor sense of self-esteem by that point.
* Then we finally get to Season 2, and Lana and Withney break up for good. And sometime during the season, Clark made a move on Lana when he was wearing a red kryptonite ring, and she reciprocated it at first, but then, Clark started acting like a douche due to the ring's influence and it scared her off. They distanced themselves from each other for some time after this, but then, at some point, Clark tried again to ask Lana out on a real date. And she said yes, and once again, Clark was on Red K later in this episode, made out with Chloe on the Talon, and Lana saw everything. The same cycle repeated.
* The first two seasons also showcase the main issue with Clark and Lana's interactions. Their communication is, decidedly, not great. They're not direct or explicit with their feelings and intentions in Season 1 and 2, instead resorting to teasing and vague dialogue, even in some of their intimate moments. Poor communication will unfortunately become a pattern for these two. 
* To be fair though, they aren't the only characters in this series to be somewhat stunted in their communication skills. However, this rocky start to Clark and Lana's relationship, characterised by drama, unspoken truths and self-doubt, only forshadows their issues to come. A fresh start was needed, and luckily the opportunity came the next season... though it was short-lived.
* At the beginning of Season 3, after Clark returned from Metropolis and wasn't wearing the Red K ring anymore, they had another opportunity to rekindle their relationship. And here it's when Clark's fears and desires that we outlined previously come in full display. He wants to be with Lana, he wants their relationship to work, but he didn't believe Lana could love the parts of him that he kept secret. Clark's fear that Lana might reject him caused him to put their attempts of a romantic relationship behind him, hence what I said earlier about his unhealthy strategies to avoid heartbreak and his iferiority complex.
* Lana, in turn, tried to reassure him that she would care for him no matter what, asking Clark for a second chance. And even after he put an end to it, she persisted with their friendship. She pretended that she was okay with just being friends with Clark when it was clear that she wasn't. She basically turned places with Clark from Season 1, in which he was the one longing for her, when she was unattainable. This also ties back to what I mentioned about Lana's fear to lose the people she cares about and her willingness to do everything she can to avoid anything that might create an opportunity for her worst fear to come true, including staying in a relationship that is emotionally causing her more harm than good.
* Now, a lot of people tend to criticize Lana's character in this season because of her insistance in a possibility of her and Clark getting back together and her feelings of being ""entitled"" to know his secret. But if you analyze her behavior through this lens, you'll notice that Lana’s actions are not rooted in entitlement, but in **emotional survival**. For someone whose emotional foundation was rocked by the trauma of losing her parents at such a young age and in such unexpected way, *uncertainty* is a trigger. And Clark — in all his well-meaning secrecy — becomes a source of constant emotional instability. Lana doesn’t demand to know his secret because she’s ""toxic"" or ""controlling"". She seeks the truth because the *not knowing* erodes her trust and leaves her vulnerable in a relationship that often feels one-sided from her perspective. 
* The more Clark hides, the more Lana feels like she’s loving someone she *can’t truly see*. And that creates an emotional power imbalance that’s not sustainable. This is especially tragic because, ironically, **Lana is one of the few characters who repeatedly proves she can handle the truth** — time and time again, when Clark does finally open up (briefly), she meets it with understanding, not fear. But we'll get to that.
* Season 3, especially, highlights the **emotional push-and-pull** dynamic of their relationship and the tone for how they will handle conflict going forward, which is... not to. As I said, it becomes a pattern ever since Red K was first introduced: Clark will screw up in some way and then come back, tail between his legs, and Lana, ever patient and understanding of his inner workings, will let it lie. And this is examplarised multiple times throughout seasons 1-5, but especially later in Season 5.
* While I think there's time and place for hashing things out in a relationship, and that not every conflict needs to be broken down, dealing with every issue in this manner won't be good for the relationship long-term. It means one person avoids fully taking accountability or making significant changes to their problem-causing behavior, and the other consistently must circumvent their own feelings and needs in order to keep the peace.
* This kind of dynamic, where one partner repeatedly downplays their own hurt to preserve the fragile balance of the relationship, eventually leads to quiet resentment. Lana may have seemed patient, but underneath that patience is a growing fatigue. And Clark, while not malicious in his actions, becomes emotionally inconsistent — not because he doesn't care, but because he subconsciously takes Lana's love for granted. He wants to protect her from himself and thinks she would be better off without him, but still can never let her go completely, precisely for that reason. But as we know, everybody has their breaking point. And Lana finally reaches her's when she decides to leave for Paris. 

* **Seasons 4–5**: When Season 4 begins, Lana has returned from Paris, seemingly transformed. She's more independent, self-assured, and determined to carve out her own path. This version of Lana appears to be reclaiming agency over her life — stepping outside of her identity as ""Clark’s love interest"" or ""the girl next door"" and trying to define herself on her own terms. And it's also worth mentioning that she is now dating a new dude: Jason Teague.
* Clark, too, is entering a new chapter. His feelings for Lana have never gone away, but he once again finds himself caught between desire and fear — especially as the looming mystery of the Stones of Power and his destiny starts to take center stage in his life. There’s a real sense of *urgency* beneath the surface: He is running out of time to fulfill his journey, and perhaps feels like the truth of who he is will lead him into a lonely path. I think this season's plot, while a bit messy, has a lot to do with Clark's constant feeling of isolation. 
* Also, Lana being in a new relationship provides great opportunity for Clark's character to grow outside of their dynamic and for him to go through some of his adventures alone, which amplifies the sense of isolation Clark has been feeling within since Season 3 with the whole Jor-El and his alien's origins thing (and probably even before that). And yet, despite their efforts to move on — Lana with Jason, and Clark with his own missions — their connection to each other never fully disappears. Season 4 simmers with longing and emotional avoidance. Their romantic tension remains palpable, and although neither is fully available, their interactions are often laced with subtle glances, lingering silences, and a shared emotional shorthand that speaks louder than words. 
* This season highlights another major theme in Clark and Lana’s relationship: **timing.** They are rarely on the same page at the same time. When one is ready, the other isn't. When one is emotionally available, the other is entangled. Their paths seem magnetically aligned, but rarely synchronized. 
* Still talking about Clark's burden throughout this season, while other teenagers are worried about prom and dating, Clark is shouldering the burden of being the key to humanity’s safety. He wants to hold onto something normal — and for him, that’s his human connections, and Lana is one of them — but the more he clings to that idea, the more it slips away. 
* They reconnect briefly toward the end of Season 4. Lana’s breakup with Jason and her increasing involvement in the mystery of the stones leads her back into Clark’s orbit. Nevertheless, there was an episode where they assumed the role of parents when they found a baby in a field and took care of it together. Caring for the baby together gives Clark and Lana a glimpse into what their life **could be** under different circumstances. It's also one of the few times Clark acknowledges that he's not alone, even though he feels that way a lot of the time.
* And then, in the season finale, after so much buildup and the tension between them reached it's peak, they finally declare their love for each other before the second meteor shower.
* When Season 5 opens, Clark and Lana finally get together as an official couple. For a brief stretch, it’s what fans — and the characters themselves — have been waiting for. They seem genuinely happy, even domestic, in a way we haven’t seen before.
* And honestly? I think it's adorable. The first few episodes of the season showing them openly expressing their love for each other are such a delight because after everything they've been through, they can finally have a real shot at living this love story to its fullest. It feels earned. It's the kind of sweet, almost naive honeymoon phase that contrasts sharply with everything that came before. You can see it in their interactions: Clark is lighter, Lana is more grounded, and for once, they seem to *believe* in the possibility of a future together. They aren't kids anymore and thus their relationship also evolved now that they both grew as individuals, their relationship is more adult and mature now. 
* The relatability of it also makes the relationship even more real. And I think this aspect of **Clana** is key to understanding their story as a whole. This isn't a love story about a superhero and the girl of his dreams; it's about two real people. Two flawed, messy, complicated people who see each other completely and still choose each other anyway, because they genuinely love each other. That's rare.
* And when I say that they saw each other completely and still choose each other, I'm not ignoring the fact that both of them idealised each other at some point. Yes, Clark in Season 1 kind of put Lana on a pedestal (this is mostly evident in his daydreaming scenes), but if you start to think about ""the idea"" that Clark had of her in his mind that made him fall in love with her and the actual person Lana was back in the day: a charming, kind and beautiful girl with a heart of gold... I mean, he was not wrong. Clark's idea of her was pretty much close to the reality. So even though he idealised her initially, **the core of who Lana was and who Clark believed her to be weren't that far apart**. She really *was* compassionate, thoughtful, brave, and deeply empathetic. His admiration wasn’t based on an illusion — it was rooted in real qualities she consistently displayed.
* But it's worth mentioning that they were friends before they were anything else. And although everything that Clark saw for a while was just this; a kind, smart and sweet pretty girl, it was indeed never the full picture. And he learned that in the very first episode of the first season in the cemetery scene. For the first time, Clark saw that behind the smile and her charisma, there was someone deeply traumatized and who understood loss in a way he never had before. Even after seeing the parts of her that weren't so pretty, Clark's feelings for her didn't change. He could have walked away if the so ""perfect"" idea of her he had in his mind wasn't so perfect after all, but he didn't. He stayed. He choose to be there to comfort her. Not because he had to or because it was easy, but because he cared. Even in the first season, Clark saw her for who she really was, the real Lana Lang, and knew that she wasn't perfect, she had a traumatic past, she had her own burdens and her flaws, but he didn't mind any of that.
* Likewise, **Lana’s idealization of Clark** — though subtler — followed a similar path. But similarly, she also witnessed her idea of him being shattered multiple and still choose to stay. I'd say even before that, she had consciously decided she would stay faithful to Clark no matter what, so even when he was lying to her, and she knew he was lying, she still didn't choose to abandon him or walk away, instead she persisted, she showed to him in multiple ways that he could trust her and that she wouldn't judge him for whatever he was keeping. Her love was never built on a fantasy. Even when he finally shows her the Fortress and shows her his powers, she responds with understanding and even joy.
* As I said, they were close friends before they became romantic partners, but now their relationship has reached a new level; they have fun together, they support each other, and they experience moments of real intimacy. It’s arguably the most stable we’ve ever seen them. But as much as this period feels like a breath of fresh air, we start to see that familiar tension creep back in. Despite finally being in a relationship, Clark **still refuses to tell Lana the truth** about who he is.
* Lana senses that something is off. She knows Clark is hiding something big, and it triggers her **deep fear of being emotionally unsafe** — of investing in someone who can’t or won’t fully let her in. And this time, she’s less willing to silently endure it.
* The turning point is the death and reversal moment — when Clark finally tells Lana the truth about who he is, and she *accepts* him. It’s beautiful. Validating. It shows that Clark’s fears, though understandable, weren’t grounded in reality. Lana doesn’t run. She embraces him. And for a fleeting moment, the trust between them is finally complete. But then tragedy strikes. Lana dies — and Clark makes the fateful decision to reverse time using the Kryptonian crystal, choosing to *erase her knowledge of the truth* in order to save her life. It's a devastating choice. While it comes from love, it also undoes all the progress they'd made. And worse — it sends their relationship back into dishonesty.
* Lana, once again, starts to feel emotionally shut out. The man she loves keeps her at arm’s length, even when she’s standing right beside him, always doing everything in her power to show him that she is there to support him no matter what. Their arguments intensify. Lana begins to question not only Clark’s honesty, but whether he trusts her at all. And when trust disappears from a relationship — no matter how much love is left — it becomes unsustainable.
* By the end of Season 5, Clana is broken. Not because they don’t love each other, but because the weight of everything unspoken has finally collapsed the fragile structure they built. And into that void steps Lex Luthor — offering understanding, transparency, and emotional attention.
* Lana’s decision to gravitate toward Lex has always been a controversial point among fans, but from a psychological standpoint, it makes perfect sense. Lex gave her what Clark didn’t: *truth*, or at least the illusion of it. For someone who’s spent years chasing emotional clarity, it’s no surprise she’d be drawn to someone who — at least on the surface — lays it all out there.

* **Seasons 6–7**: Season 6 opens with Clark and Lana officially apart — their relationship shattered under the weight of secrecy, emotional withdrawal, and Clark’s fateful choice of keeping the truth. Lana, now deeply entrenched in a relationship with Lex, has seemingly moved on. But for both her and Clark, that separation is more complex than it appears on the surface.
* Clark still loves Lana. That hasn’t changed. But he’s forced to watch her fall into the arms of a man he no longer trusts — a man who used to be his friend, but who has grown more manipulative, secretive, and self-serving. Watching Lana and Lex together is especially painful for Clark not only because of his personal feelings, but because he suspects (rightly) that Lex is not being genuine with her — that Lex’s affection comes with strings attached.
* Meanwhile, Lana's turn toward Lex is deeply psychological. While many fans see this as an act of betrayal or character regression, in truth, it’s a mirror held up to her emotional exhaustion. She’s *tired* of waiting for honesty, tired of building her life around people who never let her in completely. Lex gives her what Clark didn’t: answers, attention, and a kind of brutal honesty — or at least the performance of it. 
* And let’s not forget: Lana **doesn't know** about Clark’s time reversal. As far as she’s aware, *she* was the one who wasn’t enough — the one Clark never trusted, even after she repeatedly showed she could handle the truth. That deeply wounds her. So when Lex offers consistency (however manipulative), it’s not that hard to understand why she would reach for it. Lana has always sought emotional security above all else, and Lex — for a time — provides that illusion. 
* That said, there’s a tragic irony here: the more Lana tries to assert control over her life (by choosing Lex), the less control she actually has. Lex's manipulation becomes increasingly apparent. Their relationship escalates quickly, and when Lex proposes, **Lana accepts.** 
* But even as Lana tries to move forward with Lex, her unresolved feelings for Clark remain. The undercurrent of love, disappointment, and betrayal between them never fully dissipates. And Clark, for his part, wrestles with his own guilt and helplessness, watching as the person he once loved is pulled into Lex’s web.
* The theme of **timing** returns with force in Season 6. Once again, they’re out of sync. Clark is finally ready to be honest. He’s willing to give her the truth, the future, everything. But now, Lana can’t take it.
* By the time Season 7 rolls around, Lana and Clark are reconnected, but something has fundamentally changed. Lana’s marriage to Lex is over, the illusion of stability shattered, and she’s finally in possession of the truth — about Clark, about Lex, and about herself.
* This version of Lana is harder. Sharper. She’s been burned by lies, betrayal, and manipulation, and she’s no longer content to be passive. She channels her pain into action — becoming more involved in the wider fight against injustice and using her platform (and Lex’s resources) to build the Isis Foundation, a nonprofit meant to protect metahumans. 
* And yet, even with all this newfound strength, her relationship with Clark still falters.
* They try again. They always do. But something is *different* now — not just between them, but within them. Lana has changed too much. Clark has changed too. Once again, their love is tested once they both realize they've become different people, especially in the Bizarro episode, when it finally culminated into them bringing their relationship issues to the table, but ultimately decide that they didn't want their relationship to end. And they once more chose to stay together.
* However, Lana was attacked by Brainiac afterwards, which leaves her in a coma for weeks, and when she finally awakens, she is no longer the same. This event marks a shift not only in her physical state, but in her emotional one as well. She becomes even more hardened, more driven, and more willing to cross lines Clark never would. Her trauma fuels her desire for independence — to never again be vulnerable or helpless. And this is what leads to one of the most defining shifts in their dynamic: **Lana decides to become Clark's equal, not just in principle, but in power**.
* She thinks that as long as she's not his equal, she will be holding him back, so she decides to finally say goodbye, leaving a message for him on a DVD.

* **Season 8 (briefly)**: Lana’s departure at the end of Season 7 — via the heartbreaking DVD message — is the final full stop to the central relationship arc that had defined *Smallville* for seven seasons. Her message to Clark is filled with love, but also with resignation. She tells him that she loves him too much to stay, that being with him would mean preventing him from fulfilling his destiny. She leaves not because she doesn’t care, but because she *does* — and she doesn’t want to be the reason he holds himself back. 
* At the start of Season 8, Clark is a changed man. He’s working at the *Daily Planet*, stepping more fully into his future identity as Superman, and trying to emotionally move forward. But it’s clear that Lana’s absence haunts him — not just because she’s gone, but because of how she left. There’s no real closure for Clark. She vanished with a message, and that finality makes it harder for him to process the loss. It's almost like a ghost relationship — one that lingers in the mind but can't be resolved in the real world. 
* And then, in a twist that reopens old wounds, **Lana returns.** 
* Her reappearance in Season 8 is short but emotionally intense. She’s no longer the same woman who left. She’s more powerful — literally — having used the Prometheus suit to match Clark's powers, and finally become his equal. They discussed her new abilities, and she said that, together, they could make the world a better place. 
* However, Lex orchestrated a plan to make Lana absorb kryptonite from a bomb, making it physically impossible for Clark and Lana to be near each other. They can't even touch. It’s a perfect metaphor for how their relationship started in Season 1, when Clark was unable to get close to Lana because of her kryptonite necklace, and now it comes full circle. What began with Clark being unable to physically approach the girl he loved because of kryptonite ends with the same tragic reality — only this time, it’s permanent. 
* But what’s even more heartbreaking is how much they’ve grown since that first season. Back then, they were teenagers struggling to understand themselves and each other. Now, they’re fully formed adults who *do* understand one another, who have fought for years to overcome the emotional and physical barriers between them — only to lose the best opportunity they ever had in their lives to be together.
* Afterwards, they have their final goodbye scene, and are separated for good.

# The Themes and Meaning in Clana

What makes Clana stand out isn’t just the romance, but what it represents thematically: 

**Love Is Not Always Easy — And That’s Okay**

That's because their love story was never easy, never perfect, never scripted to be some  smooth fairy-taleish “happily ever after.” Sometimes love is messy, uncertain, and filled with setbacks. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t real or worth having. Clark and Lana’s relationship is riddled with misunderstanding, timing and communication issues, and emotional growing pains — and yet, through it all, their love remained deeply sincere.

Clark and Lana’s relationship wasn’t about idealized passion or flawless compatibility. It was about **learning to love through imperfection** — to love someone even when things are uncertain, when trust has to be earned again, when choices are painful, and when the path forward is unclear.

Love is a sacrifice. Love is a struggle. It's messy and complicated at times. But it's also what makes life worth living. 

And if there's something that surely defines the relationship between these characters, it's that: **love.**

Even when they were apart, whenever one was going through a hard time or the weight of the world was crashing down on them, they were always there for each other. I don't know how anyone could look at such moments between them and deny that there's real connection and genuine care for one another there.

They fought for each other as long as they could, held on when everything and everyone told them to let go. Their story wasn't always all sunshine and rainbows, they of course had their moments of doubt, their breakups, their mistakes... but no matter how many times life pulled them apart, they always found their way back to each other until it was impossible to continue.

So when Lana came back in Season 8, although many people disliked it, it makes sense plot-wise for Clark's character development. This would be the chance he was waiting for to finally get the closure he wanted and in that way, finally close that chapter of his life and embrace his role as *The Hero* once and for all. But then, their interactions reignited their passion, and it proved that even after everything, after all the fights, the misunderstandings, the lying, the fear, the losses... they were stronger together.

This final chapter of their story together wasn't just about love, it was about commitment, about two people continuing to choose each other over and over again despite everything the world threw at them.

# Why the Hate? A Look at the Criticism

Much of the disdain for Clana comes from fatigue. The on-again, off-again nature of their relationship wore thin for many viewers. But to reduce it to “toxic” or “poorly written” misses the point. Their struggles are a mirror of real-life early relationships: intense, emotional, sometimes messy, but deeply impactful.

Additionally, Lana often receives disproportionate criticism. She is blamed for being inconsistent, manipulative, or dull, yet these critiques often ignore the context: she’s a young woman trying to love someone who won’t tell her the truth. Her choices — even the mistakes — reflect someone trying to navigate impossible emotional terrain.

# Conclusion: A Necessary Love

Clark and Lana's relationship is not perfect — and that's exactly what makes it important. It's not supposed to be the final love story; it's the necessary one. It shapes Clark into someone who learns the cost of secrecy, the value of trust, and the pain of letting go. And Lana? She walks away not as the girl who got left behind, but as someone who grew stronger for having loved him.

In the end, *Clana* is a story about growth, loyalty, and the complexity of becoming who you're meant to be.

  
**TL;DR:**  
Clana isn’t a perfect love story — and it’s not meant to be. Their relationship shows that love can be deep, messy, and meaningful, even if it doesn’t last forever.",2,1752882117.0,Smallville,3,1.0,False
1m3hl96,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1m3hl96/how_normal_it_is_to_have_headaches_every_single/,how normal it is to have headaches every single day?,"hi! i have headaches almost every day!

i \[22F\] am 5'6 160lbs, white (in brazil's standards, which means very mixed blood but exteriorly white), and from Brazil. i wear glasses (astigmatism, 0.5 on each eye) and i take escitalopram (20mg) for anxiety everyday. i guess you could say i have a relatively low blood pressure but its not an issue on my day to day life aside from the fact i need to eat every so often or i lose balance.

i'm currently studying engineering (on my last years, graduating in a year and a half) in UFMG, which is a federal university known for being very hard. my internship is also very demanding and, on an average day, i get out of home at 7am and get home 10pm. i don't know how relevant it is but some friends of mine have stated that my headaches are probably due to stress so i don't know.

i have headaches every single day. or almost every single day. like, 6 out of 7 days a week. some days are worst than others. some days i wanna stick a pen into my head to drain the pressure away. some days i take a cup of coffee and an ibuprofen and the pain goes away. normally, dipirona (mitamizol) is enough to mitigate the pain, but sometimes its excruciatingly painful until it does so.

my friends are constantly fery alarmed by my headaches and say its not normal at all. and that, even though they are as stressed as me, they don't have this chronic sickness haunting them. my mom, however, is JUST like me. she was the one to teach me all the tricks to make the pain beareble (turn down the lights, close your eyes, hide under a blanket, pray until the medication takes effect). my brother (18M) is learning the way of the rocks too and recently has been getting some killer migraines.

i guess i always had them. but it definitely got worse during entrance exams in high school, when i was 18. i was studying for ENEM (equivelent for SATs i guess) during the pandemic because it was my last year of high school and i remember crawling to the kitchen and swallowing two ibuprofens with coffee before i even ate anything in the morning. adulthood made it worse i guess lol

everytime i bring this up to the doctors they,,, don't really care? my blood exams are relatively good, and since i have a LOT of screentime (kind of hard not to seeing that i work under screens every hour of the day) the pain is usually attribuited to that. but its weird because sometimes i have headaches in the middle of outings with friends or, like, in completly random settings.

  
i tried to catalogue the data, but i didn't notice a pattern in hours of the day the headache comes, or things i do or don't that make the headache worsen. ive tried a lot of things. i drink a lot of water, i try to eat well during the day to avoid low blood pressure, i use my glasses as much as i can - none of this factors alter the existence of a headache

aside from the headache, i don't really feel any symptoms related to a brain tumor. believe me, i test my coordination frequently and i do the clock test every so often to make sure i'm not losing my marbles. my brain is healthy, i think?

is this stress? should i worry about this? how worried should i be?

Seems like every time I smoke I feel horrible the day after.

After spending an hour searching google and finding no answers to this I’m turning to Reddit. 
Just a little backstory: I am 41 female, very healthy, active, I eat healthy and have no health issues. I never smoked anything until 2 years ago, when I made some friends who did and then got a boyfriend who would share weed with me. 

    The first time I tried it( from a bowl) it burned a little but I got over it quickly and got high. I was noticeably thirstier and kept sipping on water but regardless, I still woke up the next day with a very dry mouth, horrible sore throat, and also felt body aches, chills, extreme fatigue and my throat was so swollen I could barely swallow. 

    I was struggling at work and convinced the weed had made me sick, but to my surprise none of my coworkers who smoked had ever experienced anything like that when I told them. 

    It took my a few days, maybe 3-4 to feel better and I didn’t smoke again for about a month. My boyfriend also didn’t think it was correlated to marijuana and had never experienced anything like that himself so after several weeks I smoked again but very lightly but I still woke up feeling trashed like last time just not quite as bad. 

    After 2 years of dating and seeing my boyfriend once a week I have noticed that the day after seeing him I’m always exhausted and feel sick. Idk how but I accepted it as normal and maybe just bc of “staying up later”, “lots of sex”, “talking and laughing more than usual” “maybe forgetting to drink as much water and getting dehydrated”. 
But I always feel sick the next day and it’s a struggle getting through my shift at work, I find myself loading up on coffee and carbs just to get through it, and sometimes I’ve even had to call out. 


    2 days ago my bf was over and I took an extra hard hit, watching the little ember in the pipe actually grow as I puffed like it did every time my bf does it. I actually felt it get warm in my chest and burn for a second. I was extra careful to sip a lot of water throughout the night but it made me pee a lot so right before bed I wanted more water (again!) but decided not to bc I didn’t want to be peeing throughout the night. 

      I woke up the next day with one of the sorest throats Ive ever had, thought I was dehydrated but no matter how much I drank it was just getting worse. I felt like it was hard to breathe like I had mild asthma or something. As the morning went on( I start work at 6:00am) I developed body aches, fatigue and I was sure Iwas having chills/fever even though the thermometer read me as normal twice. I ended up leaving early and spent the rest of the day feeling like this plus runny nose, sneezing and occasionally coughing mucus up. 

     Today is day 2 and I had to call out because it’s all still here and I still feel this weird congested tickle right where it was burning when I inhaled the weed. I am so sick of this being the norm for me but I have found zero research anywhere saying this all could be from marijuana. I don’t even smoke every time I see him but usually I’ll take a couple hits. I have not documented whether I felt better the mornings after I didn’t smoke, but I’m going to take a break and see. 

     Anyone else out there who’s heard of this happening? I know I can’t be crazy lol",2,1752881936.0,holistic,0,1.0,False
1m3hiwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1m3hiwz/critique_for_true_story/,Critique for True story.,"To introduce, I’m from a production background, and truthfully not much of a writer. But I’ve been attempting to write a semi-true book about my rural youth, I want some help on what you may think about the first chapter as I need some pointers. What could be done better/differently in terms of style? What is possibly good? Is the story too cliche?

I’m on that same train home.The same one I’ve taken seven times since.The bump in the track just before Chalford still kicks me awake. That’s when it hits. I’m back. Back in Stroud. Back where I grew up.
It’s inevitable you’ll see people you know when you’re from a town of 10,000. People you grew up with. People who never left. The elderly Brexiters who still complain whenever a new barbers or coffee shop opens, as if it’s gentrification, not rot, changing the town.
I’ve never really understood that cliché, returning home and thinking you’re better than the place you were raised. Coming back with your city ideas, talking like you’ve outgrown it all; how you’re suddenly ‘better’ than those who choose to remain.
But this time... this time feels different.
Because I’m not just visiting. I’m back. Properly.Stationary. Caught in this gap between failure and freedom, stuck in the one place I spent years trying to escape.
Four years in London. Four years trying to survive, socialise, and act like I belonged to some higher version of myself. Four years trying to become someone.
Now I’m back here. In Stroud. A place I narrowly resent to call home.
And this time, I don’t feel anything at all.Just grey. Just weight.The slow realisation that ‘this’; Not the city, not the leaving, might be the real beginning. The lead up to the finale. 
 
I walk off the train with the same weight that grips me each time, the air tying me down, the families hugging in reunion, I walk past my friends-sisters-friend, nodding in some slight acknowledgment of politeness even though I know the local takeaway cook with more familiarity.
 
My freshly steam-pressed suit was creasing between the grip I lent to it. I turn the ticket office corner & approach my mother’s 15 year-old mud-clothed Suzuki swift; the sound of the fanbelt ready to give up, that high-pitched wheeze I used to be embarrassed by. 
Now it’s a sound I almost look forward to.It’s strange, the comfort you find in something still falling apart. At least it means someone’s waiting.
Finally moving above a 20mph speed limit felt strange.Not being perched on the second floor of a seventeen-tonne Routemaster.This road here bends with the hills.
I couldn’t hold the conversation my mum was trying to start. Not because I didn’t care - I did. But because possibly, this was it now.This stretch of road. This familiar view through the windshield.The houses, the hills, the pubs, the parks, the corner shops - all of them holding versions of me I’d half-forgotten. This time faster than I’d once seen them, losing view quicker this time. 
I knew we were nearing home; this isn’t necessarily a bad thing; cheap food, cheap rent, but it’s where everything would start back up again. Noise becomes stagnant; whatever I’d once pressed pause on, comes again, uncomfortably familiar.

This’ll be the first ‘real’ funeral I’ve been to, ever. Like one that actually matters.
 
The suit – Now crumpled now in the back of the car among everything I own. Once a prop in my room for many years, reserved for black-tie nights in a bar I shouldn’t of ever really been allowed in. Now becoming something real; Exiting my mother’s car steps away from my home door, all too close to home.
 
This isn’t a game I’d played too many times before. One of true knowledge that this time, I’d lost someone for good. 
 
I walk down these worn tiles, looking at the remnants of a once sought upon plum tree, alongside the tiny gravestones of animals I once held like siblings. My amphetamine-worn key sticks in the lock, but it still turns. The door opens to a smell I didn’t know I’d forgotten - one only this house has.
 
It wasn’t long after the expected conversations that I was back in bed. Back in my room again. We’d moved here when I was four, a couple years after mum had enough of dad. I’ve lived half of my life here, in this room, in-between sofas of friends or the floor of a forest seemingly comfortable after enough ketamine.
 
This yellow-stained ceiling less comforting than it had once been before. Warmer though, than my Victorian built freezer I’ve called home over four chanceful years. I couldn’t evade the stare I’d fixated on the red spot on my ceiling that I’ve seen so many times before, always at sunrise, always through the fog of a cold sweat and that low, gnawing dread about what I might’ve said the night before.
 
Since I exited the train door my mundanity has been numbing, like don’t get me wrong, the best times of my life are here & will always be here. These people, these hills, the smoke, the sound, this entity, this; this is my being. The thing that undoes me, and the only thing that keeps me whole.
 
I’ll see everyone soon, in our Sunday best, exchanging talk about how we never thought Jake would be first to go. 
 
Invincible he was. Made of steel. I once saw him drink a triple shot americano whilst chugging an American spirit at the caff after 16 hours of coke, booze & pills. This was enough to know he was the man who could command us.
 
Mum brought me up some tea. Ham, eggs & parsley liquor. Not all that different to what I’d eat in London, strangely, even here in the deep south-West. 
 
She hovered at the door, like she was trying to not look worried, but couldn’t help it. I told her I’d find a place soon, that I’d get sorted, be out of her hair.
 
I could tell that hurt her.
 
Just give me this week to leave Jake behind.

I’m swimming a little and doing the lightest arm workouts and 10min walks. Can’t tell if this is a trigger because it’s always days later. 

Eating? Low histamine helped me a ton! Now I’m reintroducing foods and it’s been ok. Something isn’t though but I can’t tell. I started taking Protien powder, drank coffee. All is ok till days later not at the time like before so I can’t tell. It’s hard to stay so strict on foods.

The night was thick with the kind of silence that begged to be shattered.

I stood on the roof of the old lottery house, heart pounding, blood vibrating under my skin like it was waiting to burst. Gaspar crouched beside me, hands already glistening with frost, eager. Honny was floating lazily above the ground, arms folded, as if this was just another boring Thursday.

I wasn’t sure when we stopped being scared. Maybe we never were.

“All set?” Gaspar hissed, eyes gleaming. He didn’t wait for an answer—he never did.

The building below us was pathetic. Cracked tiles, rusty iron grates, the name of the bank peeling off the walls like it had already given up. One of those tiny places where poor people come to cry over denied loans and lost futures. Ironic, really.

I clenched my fists. Focus. I wasn’t here for fun.

Boom.

The explosion wasn’t subtle. It wasn’t smart. It wasn’t even necessary. But it felt good. The moment my power triggered from my palm and launched me across the street like a cannonball, I felt it again—that electric pulse, that rush that Zula had dragged out of me. I was flying. No, I was erupting.

I crashed through the upper window like a meteor, glass showering the floor, and landed inside the lobby with a heavy, echoing thud. Gaspar dropped in behind me, freezing the cameras. Honny slid through the door as if he owned the place.

“Move fast,” I muttered.

It was over in minutes. A couple of explosions, the vault blown open like paper, bills scattered into the air like leaves in a storm. The scent of fire, metal, and wet concrete filled my lungs. I coughed—laughed—wiped ash off my cheek.

And then I did something dumb.

I walked outside.

Gaspar grinned like a maniac and yelled, “Come see, beautiful people! Today is Christmas!”

I looked at him like he was insane—but I didn’t stop him.

The sound had drawn people out, dozens of them, lining the crooked sidewalks. Old women in robes, shirtless men with plastic chairs still in hand, barefoot kids with bellies empty of dinner and full of dreams. They stared at us with wide, hungry eyes.

Honny floated above the street, holding up bundles of cash like a holy offering.

And we—God help us—we started throwing it.

“You! For your gas bill!”

“For your milk, grandma!”

“For your son’s school! Take it—take all of it!”

They rushed forward, screaming and laughing, crying. One woman dropped to her knees in front of me and kissed my wrist. “Bless you,” she sobbed. “Finally someone for us.”

Gaspar raised his arms like a prophet. Honny was spinning in the air, howling with joy.

And I—me—I felt something dangerous click into place.

Hope.

Until it wasn’t.

A voice cut through the crowd. Calm, stern. “This isn’t right.”

Everyone turned. A man in a clean shirt and tired eyes stood in the middle of the chaos. “You think this is justice? This is theft. This is madness. What you’re doing—it’ll come back for you.”

Gaspar’s smile disappeared.

“You call this madness?” he growled.

The man didn’t back down. “You’re hurting everyone. You’re making it worse.”

Honny’s hand twitched. The old cord from the abandoned utility pole slithered through the air and wrapped around the man like a snake.

“You speak like a dog with a master,” Honny hissed. “You think they’ll reward you for licking boots?”

“Enough!” Gaspar shouted. He climbed the nearest light post with ease, frost trailing behind his boots. “Listen to me! If you do not stand for your own people, then you don’t belong among them!”

The crowd screamed in agreement.

“He won’t be harmed,” Gaspar announced. “But he will learn.”

They hoisted the man with the old cable, wrapping him up like a gift and tying him to the top of the light post. He dangled there, swaying slightly, silent.

Just… watching us.

I stared at him, then at my hands.

What the hell are we becoming?

And still—still—I looked back at the people below. Laughing. Crying. Free. If even for a moment.

Maybe this wasn’t justice yet. Maybe this was just the spark.

I turned to the crowd and raised my arms.

“We’re not villains,” I said, voice shaking. “We’re not heroes either. We’re what’s left when no one else comes.”

The people roared.

I didn’t know if I believed it yet. But I wanted to. I had to.

Because maybe this… this was finally mine.

**Danny**

We were just stepping out of the hospital when the world reminded me it wasn’t done with us.

The glass doors slid open with that little hiss, and the sunlight hit my face like a challenge. Mom was at my side, finally off the IVs, walking with the kind of tired grace only a mother could pull off. Jerrod had one arm around her shoulder, the other holding the bag of prescriptions. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days. Maybe he hadn’t. Maybe none of us had.

We didn’t talk much. There was no need. The city was still humming. No one gave a damn that we had just survived an attack, that schools were being turned into war zones. No one stopped for us. That’s how it always was.

And then I heard it.

Screams.

They were close. Two blocks away, maybe less. Something sharp in them—desperation, anger, the kind that cuts deeper than blades. Jerrod and I locked eyes.

He knew before I said it.

“Let’s go,” I muttered.

“Danny—” my mom started, but it was too late. I was already walking. Jerrod followed. That’s the thing about brothers—you don’t always agree, but when it matters, they stand with you.

We turned the corner, and there they were.

Two men. One tall and jagged like cracked pavement, his arms and legs covered in pulsing stone plates. The other moved like water itself—liquid sloshing from his fingers, coiling around his arms, his smile crooked like he enjoyed this too much. They were tormenting a family. A father shielding his daughter. A woman crying over a broken wrist. Nobody was helping. No one dared.

I felt my teeth grit.

“Hey!” I shouted. “Why don’t you pick on someone who can hit back?”

The stone guy turned slowly, like the air annoyed him.

“You lost, kid?” he grunted.

“No,” I said. “I’m just done watching.”

And I ran.

I didn’t wait for Jerrod. I trusted him. I trusted myself.

I felt the pouch of blood Zula had given me still sealed under my shirt, but I didn’t reach for it yet. I wanted to feel what I could do without it. Just me.

The air tasted like burnt asphalt and sweat. I could barely hear anything over the pounding in my chest.

The water guy flicked his wrist again—too fast. A whip lashed toward my face. I ducked, felt the sting of mist cut across my cheek, icy and thin like glass. Jerrod had already thrown himself into the stone guy, fists crackling against a body that felt more like building than man. Their punches echoed like demolition hammers.

I moved on instinct.

The man of water was smirking—too confident. He thought he had me. Maybe he did.

I crouched, hands on the pavement, and then I felt it. The heat under my skin. Pressure in my palms. Something leaking—no, pouring.

My pores.

My blood.

It wasn’t just from wounds anymore.

I lifted my hands. Red droplets surfaced from the creases of my fingers like sweat, but heavier, thicker, alive. They shimmered under the streetlight, trembling with my heartbeat. I’d never done this. I didn’t know I could.

But my body did.

The droplets joined mid-air, whirling, spinning into a thin spiral. A blade. No time to think. Just act.

I flung it forward.

It didn’t slice—it cut. Right across his arm. A clean burn of red followed, and he screamed.

“You little—!”

His voice turned into a roar, and water surged from a nearby hydrant, forming a wall. He sent it crashing toward me.

I clenched my fists, raised both arms, and the blood twisted back—forming a shield midair. The water smashed into it, sending me stumbling, knees scraping asphalt. My ears rang. I was on my back. The shield broke. My blood scattered.

He stepped forward, laughing.

“You’re nothing.”

Maybe. But I was becoming something.

I pulled myself up, slower now. One breath. Two. I tasted copper in my throat again and didn’t swallow it—I called it. Blood floated from my tongue, from my lips, from my hands.

It obeyed.

I shaped it tighter, denser, not a ribbon—a nail. And I drove it forward.

Straight into his ribs.

He gasped, bent over, clutching his side.

That’s when I turned.

And saw her.

She was already moving.

A blur of red hair, cutting through the chaos like a siren. Not a hero’s entrance—just a mother running straight into danger.

I froze.

“Mom—!”

Too late.

She collided with the stone guy, her full weight slamming into his side with a force I didn’t know she still had. He staggered back, surprised, and Jerrod got his breath for half a second.

She didn’t wait. She darted left, then spun low and kicked—right into the man’s knee.

Bad call.

Her foot cracked against his skin like bone hitting marble. She stumbled, lost balance.

He grabbed her by the arm.

Like lifting a doll.

“No!”

He flung her—across the street—into a parked car. The metal folded with a scream of tearing steel.

My scream followed right after.

“MOM!”

The world stopped moving.

Heat shot through my chest, up my throat, into my face. I didn’t care if the blood answered me. I didn’t care if it hurt.

I needed more.

From my nose, from my mouth, from my palms—from every pore that could bleed—I poured. The blood wasn’t waiting for my command anymore. It knew. It spun itself, fast, wild, vibrating like fury incarnate.

A spear.

I launched it with everything I had.

It slammed into the water guy’s face.

Not enough to kill. I didn’t care.

Enough to silence him.

He crumpled, finally.

I turned to Jerrod. His shoulder was hanging wrong, his breath ragged, knuckles split open—but his eyes found mine. Something passed between us. Not a word. Just… trust.

“You’re better at this than I am,” he muttered.

“No,” I said, stepping forward, pulling blood like threads from the stone man’s ankle. “We’re better together.”

The blood wrapped around the leg. I pulled.

The man stumbled, knees buckling. Jerrod surged forward with a roar, his fists glowing with kinetic charge. One punch to the ribs—stone cracked.

My blood rushed in, threading through the cracks like water through roots.

And then it detonated.

A red burst from inside. Not enough to kill—but enough.

He collapsed.

The water guy tried to crawl away.

But there she was.

Mom. Limping. Bleeding. Still standing.

She stepped in front of him, raised a trembling hand, and with one open palm across his face—put him down.

Silence.

Only our breathing now. Sirens in the distance. The smell of metal and rain and ozone.

A family nearby cried, hugging, thanking us. We didn’t answer. We weren’t ready to speak.

Mom wiped blood from her lip, smiled through it. Soft. Tired. Whole.

“I’m proud of you two,” she said, her voice hoarse. “You’re already more than your father ever was. And I’m… I’m glad you’re fighting side by side.”

I didn’t say anything.

But I felt it too.

We started walking.

Back home.

Together.

———

**Tasha**

My father didn’t say much when he dropped me off.
He stood by the car, arms crossed, waiting for my mother to finish crying like she always did when things didn’t go as planned. They both hugged me, told me they loved me, and said Aunt Mel would take care of everything. And just like that, they drove off, disappearing into the white fog of the city like two ghosts who had finally given up on haunting me.

Aunt Mel lived in a narrow blue house that smelled like old wires and cheap incense. She opened the door wearing a bathrobe with coffee stains and a Bluetooth headset that wasn’t connected to anything.
“Oh! You’re taller than I remember. Are you sure you’re not adopted?” she asked, already turning her back. “Well, doesn’t matter now. Come in before the pigeons steal your soul.”

Yeah. That kind of crazy.

Her house was filled with stacks of receipts, humming old machines, and a dozen calculators she called “my little darlings.” I sat on a couch with a spring that poked my thigh and listened to her argue with her invisible boyfriend, João  who, for the record, was a cactus.

“Your room’s upstairs,” she said, handing me a pink towel covered in glitter. “You’ll share it with the past trauma of every tax season I’ve ever survived. But don’t worry, the trauma sleeps on the top bunk.”

⸻

The next morning, I woke up early.

Something inside me buzzed. A restlessness under my skin. I walked around the house barefoot, fingertips trailing across surfaces. I could feel the current. Every plug, every socket, every stupid blinking microwave light had a rhythm. A pulse. I followed one of them to a device Aunt Mel had built herself—something between a toaster and a printer—and touched it.

I didn’t mean to do it.

I just wanted to feel it.

But something clicked inside me. My body inhaled the energy like breath—deep and greedy—and when I pushed it back, it all surged into the machine at once. It sparked, cracked, whined—and exploded in a puff of smoke and melted plastic.

“WELL,” Aunt Mel shouted from the kitchen. “There goes my tax demon suppressor! Good thing I have two!”

I stepped outside, needing air.
And for a moment, I just… listened.

I could feel the wires in the telephone poles. The little charges running through the metal fences. Even the birds above me—they had something too. A pulse. A life. I stared at one resting on a tree branch, focused on the current beneath its feathers, and with a flick of my hand—
Pop.
It dropped dead.
My breath caught in my throat.

I ran to it, knelt beside the lifeless little body.
I didn’t mean to do that either.

But I did.

I felt its energy become mine.
I didn’t feel stronger.
I just felt… capable.

I walked back slowly, my hands tingling, and sat on the front steps, legs shaking.
I had power now. Real power.
I didn’t need to prove anything to anyone anymore.

I imagined a uniform. Black and gold, maybe. A mask that didn’t hide me—but made people finally look.
“I will save people,” I whispered to myself. “I was born to do good.”

Aunt Mel came out with two mugs. One she gave me. The other she offered to the cactus.
“You ever wonder,” she said, taking a sip, “why everyone wants to be a hero?”

I didn’t answer.

She did anyway.

“Our family was born for spreadsheets, not spotlights. Someone’s gotta know where the money goes, you know? Society only works if everyone has a role. But lately, seems like the only roles that matter are the flashy ones. You can throw a building, great. But can you file an audit on a corrupt politician? No? Then maybe your power’s not that impressive.”

She looked at me sideways. Her eyes were serious for once.
“I’ve seen heroes steal, lie, ruin people. Just because they could. Maybe we’d be better off if no one had powers at all.”

She went back inside, humming something off-tune.

I sat there for a long time, staring at the sky, trying to decide if she was right.
Maybe the system was broken.
Maybe the ones with power didn’t deserve it.

But I had it now.

And I wasn’t going to waste it.

Not like them.

———

**Zenos**

The bandage was too tight. Or maybe I just wasn’t used to breathing without guilt.

My mother worked in silence, the same way she always had. She tied each knot with the precision of someone who had watched too many sons break in her hands. Her fingers paused near my ribs once, maybe from the bruising, maybe from something else. But she didn’t look up.

“You never heal straight,” she muttered. “Still don’t.”

I didn’t answer. Didn’t flinch. Just stared at the floor until she stepped away and left me standing there, shirt half on, soul half off.

“I have to go,” I said.

No one stopped me.

⸻

The air outside Elise’s house always smelled like lavender and decay.

She opened the door before I knocked. Her hair was messier than usual. Your sky-blue eyes always pulled me in—and this time was no different. Sweatshirt oversized. And still—still—she looked like someone who remembered how to live.

“Zenos,” she said, arms crossed. “You look like hell.”

“Feels like I’m on brand.”

She didn’t laugh. Just stepped aside.

Inside, the walls were full of strange hums. Old machines murmuring to each other. Books with half-open mouths. Jars that glowed faintly on the shelves.

I sat on her couch like it was a hospital bed.

“I thought I was changing,” I said. “Thought I could be more than what I’ve been. That maybe, this time, I’d get it right.”

She didn’t interrupt.

“I’m trying to save them,” I said. “Really trying. But today… I saw myself in the mirror and I thought—shit. I look like one of your zombies.”

Her eyebrow lifted. “Excuse me, my zombies are way more coordinated than you.”

I gave a weak laugh. My ribs hated me for it.

Then she crossed the room and sat across from me. Closer than comfort. Closer than she should have. But I didn’t stop her.

“You’re wrong, you know,” she said.

“About?”

“About not getting it right. You’re getting it more right than any of them ever did.”

I looked at her.

“Elis—”

“No, shut up and listen. You’re doing something none of them ever tried to do. You’re treating those kids like people. Like they matter. And they do. Especially to you.”

She leaned forward.

“They trust you, Zenos. Not because you’re strong. Not because you’re famous. But because they can feel it—this… broken honesty in you. They believe in that. In you.”

I didn’t know what to say. So I didn’t.

“You’re not perfect,” she continued, softer. “Gods, you’re so far from it. But they don’t need perfect. They need someone who stays. Someone who bleeds when they do. Someone who’ll crawl through hell with them.”

“And you think that’s me?” I asked.

She nodded. “I know it is.”

A silence settled. Thick, but warm. She didn’t fill it. Neither did I.

There was a past there, between us—ghosts in the room. We both felt it, but neither reached for it.

After a while, I breathed in. Let it go.

“I’m not giving up, Elis. Whatever this thing is that we’re fighting… I’ll face it. I’ll train him. Even if he’s a God.”

She tilted her head. “Train God? That’s a new one.”

“How many zombies do you have ready?” I asked, changing the subject.

Her eyes narrowed playfully.

“Zenos, please. I’m a preventive woman. I probably have fifty thousand. Maybe more.”

I smiled. “That’s enough.”

“For what?”

“For a God.”

She smiled too. Tired. Sincere.

And for the first time in weeks, I felt something settle in my chest. Not hope. But something that could grow into it.

Maybe.

If we kept moving.

If we didn’t stop.

I figured out I was obese \~7 months ago. Even before that, I had purchased things online in an attempt to lose the weight which seemed unwilling to leave my body. The weight didn’t seem to come off, but I did start getting seizures. I stopped taking it and the seizures stopped.

I recently learned that I’m pre-diabetic. 

I have a registered dietitian and a (new) therapist. Neither of them care whether or not I lose weight. I want to fire both of them, but they’re both quite nice so I’m reluctant. My dietitian tells me not to lose weight at every session. She thinks it is okay to be obese.

I feel desperate. I’m already on Metformin because I’m obese and it was prescribed to me (not from an online doctor or anything), but I’m still gaining weight. I don’t know how to proceed.

The obvious treatment for weight loss is calorie counting. Every time I have *tried* calorie counting, I eat 1000-2000 calories over my calorie limit *day after day*. I download the app, add my calories, and *I go over every time*. I really just lack self-control. I don’t know what I should do. 

If you want the numbers: I was 5’ 3” and 180 lb when I was weighed at the doctor and found out I was obese. I got down to 172 lb by living on protein bars and coffee, but those protein bars are expensive and usually not available at the grocery store. I also injured my knee from overdoing cardio at the gym, and now I can’t work out anymore.  I’m back up to 179 lb, which makes me feel like I’m at my breaking point. 

It’s like I’m trapped. I don’t want to be in this body anymore.

I was 110-120 lbs for most of my life, then gained weight ***rapidly*** in the last 1.5 years. I know how it feels to be at a healthy weight and I would do almost anything to go back.

I’ve tried meal prep. I’ve tried keeping a food diary (which my therapist asked me to do). The more things I try, without losing weight, the more I just feel more and more agitated.

At this point, how do I lose weight? What suggestions do you have for me?

1m3gx2a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m3gx2a,Claude Opus 4 is writing better contracts than lawyers (and explaining them too).  Here is the prompt you need to save thousands in legal fees,"**TL;DR: An AI is now drafting 90% of my startup's legal contracts, and they're so good my real lawyer blessed one without a single change. I'm sharing the exact prompt and process below.**

For the last month, I've been running a wild experiment: can an AI replace an expensive startup attorney for day-to-day legal work?

The answer is a terrifying and resounding **yes**.

I've been using Claude 4 Opus, and frankly, it's a revolution. We're talking about generating near-bulletproof NDAs, MSAs, and employment agreements in the time it takes to make a coffee. The days of paying $500/hour for a template with my name on it are over.

# What It Actually Does (The Mind-Blowing Part)

This isn't just a fancy template generator. It's an active legal assistant. It can:

* **Draft from Scratch:** Pick any standard startup contract, and it builds it from the ground up.
* **Explain Like I'm 5:** Every single clause is followed by a simple, plain-English explanation of what it means and why it's there. No more dense legalese.
* **Spot What's Missing:** It automatically flags critical terms you might have forgotten, *before* they become a problem.
* **Jurisdiction-Aware:** It customizes contracts for specific state or country laws (e.g., California's tricky auto-renewal rules).
* **Export Ready-to-Sign PDFs:** The final output is a professionally formatted document ready for DocuSign.

# The ""Mega-Prompt"" That's Saving Me $10k/Month

This is the golden goose. It took weeks of tweaking to get it perfect. The key is giving the AI a specific role, clear inputs, and a structured task list.

>

# Real Results From the Past 30 Days:

* **✅ Flawless Advisor Agreement:** Generated a Series A advisor agreement. I sent it to my (human) lawyer just to be safe. His response? ""Looks great, no changes."" That single check-in would have normally cost me $1,500.
* **✅ EU-Compliant SaaS Terms:** Spat out GDPR-compliant terms of service in about 4 minutes.
* **✅ Caught My Mistake:** Drafted a multi-state NDA and its ""Practical Notes"" section flagged a potential non-compete issue that I had completely missed.
* **✅ Signed Without Redlines:** Our biggest client signed a 50-page enterprise MSA it generated without a single redline. This has *never* happened.

# Pro-Tips I Learned the Hard Way:

* **Opus > Sonnet:** You have to use Claude Opus 4. Sonnet is good, but Opus catches the subtle edge cases that can screw you over.
* **The ""Red Flag Review"":** After it generates the contract, ask it: *""Review this contract for any red flags or ambiguities from the perspective of the opposing party.""* It will find its own weaknesses.
* **Upload Your Templates:** If you have old contracts you like, upload them first and say, *""Learn from this style and improve it.""*
* **Play Devil's Advocate:** My favorite follow-up is, *""What's the weakest clause in this agreement? How would opposing counsel attack it?""*
* **Generate Versions:** Ask for different flavors. *""Now make this version more founder-friendly.""* or *""Generate a version that is aggressively protective of our IP.""*

# When You STILL Need a Real Lawyer

Let's be clear, this doesn't replace lawyers entirely. It replaces the expensive, low-value *grunt work*. I still call my lawyer for:

* High-stakes deals (>$1M)
* M&A or fundraising documents (Term Sheets, etc.)
* Actual litigation or legal disputes

I asked if I was allowed to take her or get her from the house because I wasn’t sure if I was allowed there due to a situation me and her sister but also my friend (AA) have been going through. A had said it’s fine, so we went and picked her up.

While we were waiting for A to come out of the house so we could go get coffee, she texted us we can come inside, because it might take her a little bit to be done with what she was doing. I still wasn’t sure if I could go inside because of me and AA not currently talking to each other and removing me from Snapchat a couple weeks prior to today.  When A came outside she told us that AA actually sent that text that we could come inside and that she was fine with us coming in. I was confused hearing that, why would they remove me from Snapchat and not talk to me for months but invite me inside the house. When we got back to the house I went inside to use the restroom and wanted to see AA, maybe talk or to just see how she was doing.  She was outside in the office when we got back, so I didn’t see her or talk to her.

Their older sister had called A on the phone and asked to speak to me, when I got handed the phone they had told me “I don’t want to be the bad guy, but I’m going to be the bad guy, I’m going to ask that you leave, there is cameras and they can see you are here, so would you quickly leave because your not allowed at the house” I had told her that I wasn’t aware I wasn’t supposed to be there. She just said okay, I just don’t want my sisters to get in trouble. When we hung up A stated she really doesn’t like you, which I had already know since last summer, and tried to understand why or come to better terms with her.  A had also said maybe AA told the older sister, due to A thinking they were on a call together when we got back.

I’m just confused how AA feels about me and if there’s something I don’t know about how the parents feel about me.",1,1752880222.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

It was quiet despite the low hum of the ship’s engines and his obnoxious snoring. The room was dimly lit from the television airing an adult animation with crude jokes and satire.

Every so often, he’d groan or mutter about vodka and lizards and smacking his lips at the thought of a bowl of warm solyanka.

Deep into his kidneys, his nerves screamed. A white-hot pain ran down his ureters like fire in a straw.

He bolts upright, clutching his side.

“OH! BLYAT!!” He gritted, sucking his teeth in. “No… not fucking kidney stones… not again!”

He kept yelling as he barreled his way towards the bathroom. He began peeing, pain ran through his urethra like he was pissing lava.

“OOOH! OOH! OH! AH!” He sighed with relief as the pain finally faded. He looked down the toilet bowl and frowned. “Dammit,” he muttered. “It didn’t pass. Of course, it didn’t.”

He sighed and flushed the toilet, his eyelids drooped and dark circles formed under his eyes. With a groan, he unscrewed a flask and took a sip. The liquid burned down his esophagus.

“Ah,” he smiled. “Nothing like some good ol’ vodka to clear the pipe.”

He put his flask away and stumbled towards his room. The door hissed open, and he leaned on the doorway and exhaled. 

Then he heard footsteps approaching. He looked around his shoulder, but he wasn’t scared or nervous or anything.

“Infiltrator?” The voice called. Then they walked towards the room.

An alien, reptilian. He had an angular geckoid head with a small horn jutted up from his nose. Bioluminescent markings ran across his cheekbones and jawline. His sclera was light blue and his pupils were razor-thin slits. His scales were mostly dark ocean-blue save for a big blotch of white scales on his lower neck that ran down his belly with an orange outline surrounding the white scales. 

He towered Infiltrator at an impressive seven-foot two compared to Infiltrator’s five-foot nine. And he was more lean and muscular than Infiltrator.

“What’s the matter, Infiltrator?” The lizard asked, placing a hand on the man’s shoulder. “I heard you yelling in your room. Something wrong, nivea?”

Infiltrator groaned, anchoring himself on the doorframe. “It was kidney stones… again. Shit burned like napalm, Jules, fucking napalm.”

Jules only smirked. “Then maybe you should stop eating all that salty food and drinking all that vodka, especially those cheese puffs you stuff your mouth with.”

Infiltrator growled with a scowl. “You… you shut the hell up, Jules. I can eat whatever I want. You’re not my mother.”

Jules narrowed his eyes and gave a light growl. But he stood up and raised his hands in mock surrender. “I’m just looking out for you, Infil. Anyways, I’m going back to bed.” He yawned. “Goodnight, Infiltrator.”

Jules walked away, and Infiltrator stared for a moment. “Good night, Jules,” he muttered to himself before collapsing back onto the couch. He stared at the screen, the episode had just rolled credits with a sad song playing. He didn’t follow the plot, but the ache in his chest matched the tone perfectly. All he could think about was himself, a big joke for everyone to laugh at. That’s what he thought to himself at least.

And he drifted off… sleep had finally claimed him for the night.

The next morning, Infiltrator woke up. He felt exhausted. He stretched and yawned and then scratched his back. He looked around for the time. The TV was showing an infomercial of a new multi-purpose vacuum that could vacuum, steam, and deep clean, no attachments needed. He turned off the television and made way towards the kitchen.

The pleasant smell of frying eggs and greasy bacon overloaded his nose. And when he got to the breakroom, a few people had already beaten him there. 

One of them was Jules frying up breakfast. Across the room was a bald man in power armor with a red cross stitched on a white tabard, he was reading the news on a holo-tablet. 

Then closest to him, smiling, was another one of lizard aliens. He looked quite similar to Jules but he had yellow-orange scales instead of blue. He was sipping some coffee, not the watery breakroom coffee, something more refined, crafted. He waved at Infiltrator with a welcoming smile.

In a dark corner was another one of the lizards. He had his feet kicked up on the table. He had gray scales. Their beauty and luster had dulled. Horns jutted out from his head, massive but they were well-groomed. And he had a patch of small horns trimmed down on his gullet. And he was a massive beast, almost twice the size of Infiltrator. Broad shoulders, wide chest, arms like logs, round a beer keg in the center, but nonetheless, built for war. He laid back, face blank, snoring like a dragon. 

Infiltrator squinted at the kitchen table. A cheap fold-up chair sat there, brave and defiant. He didn’t remember it looking so small last night. But he was too tired to care. He slumped into it anyway.

SCREEEAAAKKKK…

The poor little chair groaned under the massive lizard’s weight like it was whispering its final prayers. A leg bent sideways. Infiltrator blinked down at it, paused, and sighed.

“Same, buddy,” he muttered, rubbing his face.
The coffee machine sputtered to life in the background, somehow louder than his internal screaming.

Infiltrator enjoyed his morning coffee, which he slipped a little liquid courage in. He leaned back to see that the man in power was handing him a deadpan judgmental stare.

Infiltrator froze with the cup inches from his lips. “What? Something on my shirt, Templar?”
Templar just exhaled and continued reading the news. Infiltrator went back to his business, sipping his vodka-laced coffee. 

Jules had just finished plating breakfast: eggs, bacon, and toast, plain and simple.

“Good morning, Infiltrator. Did you sleep well?” Jules smiled, fixing him a plate.

Infiltrator grunted in response, taking the plate with a fork. He took a seat in front of Templar, who had just finished reading the morning news.

“Anything interesting on the news, Templar?” He shoves some eggs in his mouth.

“No, just a cynical alcoholic screaming last night.” Templar grunted in amusement, pouring some coffee.

Infiltrator shot him a bird.

“Oh, did I not tell you yet…” Jules butted in. “He has kidney stones again.”

“Again?” Templar replied like it was no surprise, yet it astonished him. “This is like the third time this month, Infiltrator. What the hell have you been eating?”

Infiltrator threw his hands up defensively. “Look, Templar, I haven’t been eating anything salty or drinking sodas or any of that shit. I don’t know how I’ve been getting kidney stones. So would you shut up and lemme eat my breakfast.” He gives Templar a dead stare while sipping his coffee. 

Templar didn’t reply and went to get his plate.

Then he heard a low growl that shook his soul. “Mmm, is that bacon I smell?” It spoke slowly in a pitch much deeper than Templar’s. 

Infiltrator turned around towards the sleeping giant, now awake with one eye open and a grin on his face. “Jesus, Serrax. Don’t do that again. I thought God was calling me home.”

Serrax raised a brow as he sat up, the chair slowly began to give in under his weight. “And you have a problem with my voice, Infiltrator?”

“No, that chair’s having a problem with your fatass sitting on it.”

Serrax narrowed his eyes into thin slits and growled.
“It’s like the fourth chair you broke this week.”

“Careful, Infiltrator, this fatass can rip you in half.” Serrax smirked, getting up. His head nearly touched the ceiling. He walked over to the counter and grabbed a platter, filled it up to the top with a cartonload of eggs, twenty strips of bacon, and a loaf of toast, and a big mug filled with coffee. 

“Uh, huh.” Infiltrator finished his meal then threw his plate in the sink. He wiped his hands and looked down at the lizard with the yellowish-orange scales. “Kyro, what time is it?”

Kyro looked at his watch. “In human time, eight o’clock in the morning. For me? Cuddle time.” He smiled, tail swaying lazily.

“Of course… every minute is cuddle time for you, hmm?” Infiltrator crossed his arms and shot Kyro a glance.

Kyro laughs heartily and slapped his leg. “Bonding is a cultural pastime for Avarians…” he sits up. “You should know this by now, Infiltrator. You should try it sometime.” He winks.

“Yeah, last time I did that, Serrax almost rearranged my spine in three places.”

“Ha!” Serrax boomed. “It’s because you humans are weak with your little fragile bodies. It’s cute.”
Infiltrator facepalms, face red, muttering something about horny lizards. “I need to go to the bathroom.”

“Just be sure not to scream at the toilet this time,” Templar jabs. 

Infiltrator just ignores him and marches towards the bathroom. He makes it to the toilet and unzips his pants. He exhales.

It all seemed normal until that same fiery pain shot through ureters. He yelled, groaning in a strained voice.

“Ffffffff—what the fffuckk?! SHIT, CYKA!! What kidney stone is this?!?!” But the pain burned harder. He yelled out loud, sweating and gripping the toilet seat with an iron grip. It just won’t stop. Like someone was cutting up his urinary tract. “GAAHH!!” 

But finally, the shooting pain began to recede as he passed the stone. He panted, still gripping the toilet seat. He looked down in the toilet seat.

“What the fuck?” He looked at the stone he passed.
It was pulsing faintly, nothing he’s seen in a kidney stone before. He picked it up, it was the size of a pea. 
“What the… what the hell is this?” He observed the glowing stone.

“Hello there, Infiltrator,” the stone spoke in a calm and indifferent manner. 

“AHHH!!” Infiltrator screeched, throwing the stone on the sink.

“That was… unexpected.” 

“What the... what are you?” That question hung in the air, awaiting the answer.

Okay, Reddit fam, gotta share something that's been cracking me up lately. I was SO tired of my boring, plain iPhone case. Like, seriously, every phone looked the same! I wanted something that showed a little personality, ya know? I wanted something more than a Quirky iPhone case.

So, I started searching the depths of the internet for something… different. I stumbled upon this 3D pill bottle iPhone case, and I literally burst out laughing. It's exactly what it sounds like: a phone case designed to look like a giant pill bottle. 😂

I know, I know, it sounds a little weird, but trust me, it’s hilarious in person. The 3D design is super well-done, and it actually feels pretty protective. And it's made for everyday wear and tear.

One thing I was worried about was whether or not the 3D part would break off easily. I’ve had it for a couple of weeks now, and it's still going strong! I am pretty clumsy after all.

I originally saw it on ursupermart.com, and I was a little hesitant to order at first. I'm always wary of random online stores, but the price was decent, and I figured, why not?

What I didn’t expect was how much I’d like having something so… well, *me*. This sounds cheesy but it helps customers feel more playful, humorous, and unique. Also this case has visual appeal. So it Fulfills the desire for a distinctive accessory, reducing the need to sift through generic options.

I can’t say enough good things about this best conversation starter phone cases for iPhone. So if you’re looking to Order funny phone case online then do it.

Anyway, just thought I'd share! Been a long time lurker on r/DealsReddit, and I felt like I needed to pay it forward. Hope it gives someone a laugh! If you want an iPhone case that looks like a pill bottle, I got you.

It’s a great Value Focused purchase, for its price point due to its uniqueness.

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

I’m just thankful to have stumbled on this opportunity and to have grown so much.

Went from manual roasting, to completely switching to Cropster and coming up with profiles to match. 


The dream is to one day do this for myself and with higher quality coffee. Although the amount of learning I’ve gotten from production roasting and making coffee for so many different cafes and restaurants has been extremely valuable. I won’t always be 25 batches deep 5 days a week in a 95°+ warehouse. 

I will miss the chaos of 3 roasters running one day, but for now; this is my chaos and I will make the best of what I have. 

Anyway, don’t have much people that care for what I do, so having this sub to see people trying to be better and learn is always a breathe of fresh air, and maybe a few headaches here and there.

Would love to give her credit!).

I’ve modified my own trolley to suit me, but here’s a list of what I keep in my self-care cart. :)

I ended up getting a three-tier trolley from IKEA – here’s what I got – and I also got two little ‘lids’ to go on two of the levels, like this. I really like them because it helps me work from bed as well. I can turn and sit with my legs crossed and work away. And the second tier is a great place to put a cup of coffee if you’re afraid of spilling it on your tech. 

In the top tier (smallest), I have my journal, writing activity books, pens, and a hygiene bag. In the hygiene bag I’ve included: 

- micellar water & cotton pads,
- sheet face mask, 
- a spray serum from GlowHub, 
- hair bobbins, 
- a small hairbrush,
- gum, 
- deodorant, 
- hand cream, 
- tissues,
- heating pads for shoulders and lower back,
- and some perfume. 

In the second tier (the middle, medium sized), I have more of my art hobbies – I have several colouring books alongside loads of coloured pencils – as well as some books on my TBR and my Switch Lite.

And finally, in the third tier (the bottom, the largest), I have a load of snacks and drinks. A lot of my medications require me to either take them with food, or have them straight after some kind of snack, so it’s good to keep some stuff on hand for when I can’t get out of bed to get something so I can take my meds. I also keep juices, some sparkling waters, and plain waters in here. 

I push it between my bed and my desk for work, and it’s such a nice thing to have. It’s a nice kind of luxury, without being over the top. It’s accessible, and it can provide. 

Bonus points for the fact that my emotional support cat likes to chill on my emotional support cart.

so recently i went to the er because i had a really bad pain and pressure on the back of my head. the doctors ruled it out to be a tension headache from stress (they didn’t run any blood work and i was too much in pain and out of it (and anxious to speak up lol). 

about a month later, 3 days ago, i had a horrible panic attack after i drank starbucks coffee all while smoking weed. i woke up feeling nauseous and still shaken up, i couldn’t eat anything or get enough sleep for two days which caused me to loose 5lbs. this morning i woke up extremely nauseous and ended up throwing up for about 8 hours. it got to the point where my ribs were hurting. my stomach was hurting and aching as if i had the flu. i also made the mistake of going to the gym last night, i did some light work but started feeling nauseous halfway through.

it’s been about 3 hours and i haven’t thrown up since, but i still feel sick and nauseous (i do have somewhat of an appetite but i can’t bring myself to eat anything) so i’ve been sipping on electrolytes.

now, my upper left arm is feeling a little bit achy and painful and it’s been bothering me a bit. i’m 19f, 4’10, 140lbs and my family has no history of heart issues. 

what could this be? i’m just so tired of stressing out about every little thing. too scared to ask my dad to take me to the hospital because he’s exhausted from working. i just need help and reassurance… (i also just got my period yesterday if that might have anything to do with it).",0,1752879769.0,Anxiety,2,0.5,False
