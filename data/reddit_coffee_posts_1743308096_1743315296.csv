1jn6ah9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jn6ah9/aio_i_feel_like_my_friendship_is_over_after_my/,AIO I feel like my friendship is over after my friend canceled on me,"I feel super childish and ridiculous, so I'd really like some outside perspective. I know this sounds like we're still high schoolers, but I assure you we are two fully grown adult women. There's a bunch of other stuff too, but this is already a novel, so I only included the big stuff. TL;DR at the end since this is way too long (sorry).

For context, I (26F) have been friends with Lydia (26F, fake name) since middle school. We were super close in high school, and she even convinced me to do a program that let me go to college and get an Associate's degree while in high school (I often joke around saying it was the best peer pressuring I've ever had lol). We're from very different backgrounds, but it never really seemed to affect our friendship. That being said, there have been times I have felt a little bit left out. Her family is very affluent, whereas my family has been living paycheck to paycheck my entire life. When I first went to her house she took me out to her balcony and said, ""your house is down there"" and when we came back in her mom asked if she had ""shown me my house yet"" which I found pretty funny at the time, but it seems like she often brings up money to exclude me.

She has gone to Disneyland for her birthday with her friends twice in our time being friends, and I wasn't invited either time. I didn't ask her why the first time - I didn't have the money to go anyway. I was fresh out of high school with no savings, and my sister had just had a baby so my parents weren't in a position to help fund a trip like that. The second time happened after she graduated from uni. When I asked her why she didn't invite me for the second time she told me she ""thought I would be working"" which was really painful. I could have asked for time off if she just asked, and I would have loved to spend time with her. After that I thought that maybe we could go on a road trip to a dairy farm (she loves cows) so we could still have some time together for her birthday, but when I invited her she told me she was ""all tripped out.""

At one point, when she came back home on break (I worked and went to a local community college, she went to a university hours away) she forgot that we had plans. Instead of being honest about it she tried to lie. The excuse she gave was that she didn't have a ride to go to the coffee shop we were going to meet at, which was ridiculous because I could pick her up no problem (she lived literally 5 minutes away, I have a car), and instead of just owning up to it, she told me that I shouldn't bother and she just couldn't hang out. I started to distance myself after that, but we still kept in contact.

Once she came back after getting her degree, we ended up rekindling our friendship. We went out to eat a lot, and enjoyed each other's company. The other thing I need to mention here is that I'm fat. I've tried working out, eating better, and a bunch of fad diets, and yup. Still fat. When I started dieting, I knew I couldn't go out to eat with her as much anymore. When I told her about going on a diet all she said was ""let me know when you're done dieting so we can hang out."" I should have said something about how that made me feel then, but I didn't because I felt embarrassed that I had to be dieting in the first place (she's naturally thin). After a while, I decided to go off my diet and we started hanging out again. I asked if maybe we could play video games together in addition to the eating and shopping (I'm still not really well off, so I wanted to do something that didn't cost money). She isn't a huge gamer, but she plays halo with her sister sometimes and Stardew with her boyfriend. I love Stardew (I have it on PC, Switch, and PS), so I mentioned it, and she said she ""liked how we hang out now,"" and I dropped it.

More recently, she started looking for an apartment to move out of her parent's house. I was super excited for her, and we went shopping together multiple times to try to find the best stuff for her new home. We toured places and finally found a good one. She signed the papers for the apartment, but still had one more apartment tour scheduled. I asked her if she was going to cancel it, but she said no, that we should still take a look at it. Okay, cool! I'm happy if you're happy. A few days later she told me that she invited Briella (also fake name). Briella and I used to be friends, but she did some out of pocket stuff when we were in high school and I kind of just stopped talking to her. Lydia saw almost everything Briella did in high school, so it's not like she didn't know we weren't exactly buddy-buddy anymore. Given the history I wasn't thrilled about it, but it was Lydia's thing, so I was willing to suck it up. Then she said we were having brunch together, and she was picking us both up. Once again, not thrilled to be spending so much time with Bri (or being trapped in a car with her), but whatever. Then she tacked on IKEA which, for some reason, finally made me say something. I told her that I didn't feel comfortable being around Bri for that long, I didn't sign up to hang out with her in the first place, and I would be willing to talk about why I'm so uncomfortable around Bri the next day via phone call if she wanted. She replied with ""I'll cancel the IKEA thing."" As an avid reddit user, I really wanted to say ""the Iranian yogurt isn't the issue here,"" but I went with ""IKEA isn't really the issue."" She told me if I wasn't comfortable with Bri I could just not go, so I didn't. I wished her and Bri the best, and told her I hoped they had a great time (I wasn't being sarcastic, I really meant it).

Also, I know this is super small, but my mom went out of her way to make cookies using a pretty unique recipe that was passed down from my great-great-grandmother for her and her family, and she told me she didn't even try them.

Anyway, after all of that, I kind of stopped messaging her. She messaged me from time to time and I'd give small answers, but any time she tried to hang out I told her I was busy. I really didn't know how to talk to her anymore. Eventually she told me she missed me, and I told her I missed her too, but we needed to have a conversation about our friendship, and it's the kind of conversation that needs to be in person or over the phone. She told me she was going to be busy for the next two full weeks, but she could talk in two weeks in person or on the phone any time. I told her I can wait (I realized I really needed to talk face to face), and asked if the 29th (today) worked for her. She said yes. Well, I texted her yesterday to confirm that we were still on for today, and all she had to say was that she ""had a thing"" and she couldn't meet. To be fair to her, she said she could talk tomorrow, but I already have plans to join a protest, so I can't. I am just so disappointed. I wanted to have a chance to clear the air and maybe move on and continue being friends, but it feels like she gave me the last big fuck you to end our friendship. We set a date to meet two whole weeks ago and she couldn't even keep the one day we set to talk open. I feel so disillusioned, but I also feel like this is so irrational. She said she could meet me tomorrow. Maybe something serious came up. But all she had to say for herself was ""I have a thing."" She didn't say there was an emergency, just that she had ""a thing."" This whole situation feels like the culmination of years of her putting everything and everyone else first. I didn't even respond to her. I don't even know what to say.

TL;DR: After feeling like I've been left out of stuff and feeling like a low priority, I finally decided I needed to try to talk to my friend about it, and my friend canceled on me without any explanation other than she ""had a thing.""

1jn696i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jn696i/my_boyfriend_apparently_has_a_secret_identity_and/,My boyfriend apparently has a secret identity and I found his disguise kit. What do I do now?,"My partner (30M) and I (28F) have been together for about three years and recently bought and moved into our own place. We were both hesitant about it because we’re both very independent people who like alone time, but because we both think we’re in it for the long haul it felt weirder not to live together. We actually still have separate bedrooms because we both like sleeping alone, but we don’t feel like it’s a problem, we do sleep in the same bed when we feel like it, and generally our relationship/love life is really great. They’re just our chosen sleeping spaces and not our private spaces, we don’t stay out of each others’ rooms or anything and all of my closets are in his room because it’s bigger.

Today I was cleaning and vacuuming the house while he was out having coffee with a friend of ours. I went into “his” room to clean it (he leaves empty soda cans on the dresser and nightstand all the time and treats the floor like an open-plan laundry hamper, so as a biohazard containment strategy I’ve decided that acts of basic tidying and light garbage removal are actually my love language). While cleaning around the bed I discovered that the bed actually has storage in the bottom that opens up if you push on the side panels. I opened one and found some jackets that he doesn’t really wear any more in there. I nearly just closed it again but sometimes stuff like that develops mold if it’s not properly clean so i pulled them out to check them for spores and in doing so I found a small-ish metal lockbox tucked away in the back with a locked combination lock on it.

I probably should have just left it there and asked him about it when he got home. I do respect his privacy and I’m not the kind of person who needs to know every single detail of a partner’s day-to-day. I trust him, and I do know basically where he is pretty much all of the time, not because I snoop but because that’s just how our life is. We also didn’t buy the bed frame, it was part of the existing furniture, so it was also possible that the box was there from before we moved in. But I was curious and the invasion of privacy stuff didn’t really cross my mind, so just out of interest I tried his phone passcode - 4269 - as the combination, and it worked. (I’m kidding, that’s not really his code, but I do know it.)

At this point I definitely should have stopped and not looked through it, I guess, but I didn’t. In the box were a couple of black felt drawstring bags, a roll of little sticky blank labels, and a folded, printed-out photo of a guy I didn’t recognize, who looked to be roughly 40 with a goatee and graying-brown hair. When I looked through the bags, I first found two work ID cards for a business that I’m not familiar with, with the same photo of the guy on them and his name, also unfamiliar.

Obviously this felt pretty weird. But the other bag made things *scary* weird. I now long for the days of “pretty” weird. In the other bag there was a can of spray-on gray hair coloring (like you might use for a Halloween costume), a weird-looking wire thing that I couldn’t identify but that I now think is meant to go in someone’s mouth like a retainer, a little pouch of various make-up stuff, and a ziploc bag with a straight-up fake goatee in it.

It took me a good thirty seconds or so to piece this together, but suddenly I felt this horrible little chill of realization and opened the folded photo again. I genuinely didn’t recognize it at all on the first look, but with closer scrutiny it is absolutely undeniable that it is a picture of my partner, disguised as a slightly older guy. It’s not like a costume thing - it’s a really detailed thing that changes his look entirely, I don’t think I’d even recognize him in the street if I didn’t know.

I just sort of sat there in confused panic for a while. Then I put everything back as I found it, locked the box and hid it behind the jackets. I didn’t talk to him about it this evening, we didn’t really interact a whole lot - he spent the night mostly watching TV while I read a book and quietly freaked out in my room. He’s asleep now but I don’t feel like I’m gonna be able to sleep very well.

So I guess I have two main questions here. One: **what the fuck is going on?** and two: **what the fuck do I do?** Why does my partner have a weird disguise kit and ID cards hidden under his bed? I’m pretty sure he’s not a secret agent, because he’s a fucking goofball. He works as an IT guy at a local office that hires out heavy vehicles for stuff like farming and construction. At no point has he ever disappeared for a couple of days with a vague explanation and come back smelling of gunpowder and secret volcano lair. He is a very nice, sweet guy, super empathetic and caring. I have never had any reason to suspect that he’s anything other than honest with me.

I haven’t told anyone about this because I’m still figuring it out and I’m worried that if I tell someone they might confront him and I don’t know what happens then. I don’t want to confront him about it myself, at least not yet, because a) I’d have to admit to invading his privacy, which I don’t think he’d usually care about but might in this case, and b) what if it *is* something weird and scary and unsafe for me?

Any ideas for what the hell I should do about this would be appreciated, as would suggestions for what might be going on. I mean, has anyone else ever found a really high-quality disguise kit under their boyfriend’s bed? And if so, can you please reassure me that everything turned out to be perfectly normal and fine?

1jn67yy,https://www.reddit.com/r/lamedviv/comments/1jn67yy/interlude_bambi_interviews_chief_disciplinarian/,"Interlude: Bambi Interviews Chief Disciplinarian Mistress Nora On The Set: Slave's Zero And Border Bunny Present, Part 1.","Bambi's Perspective (Bambi Sux, Reporter for Fetish News Network)

Big day, I have an exclusive interview with Chief Disciplinarian of Slaves Nora Jameson in her office on the set of the Perseverance! The rising young star is not even twenty two yet, but her star eclipses to former superiors on similar trajectories, still locked helplessly in her orbit as the productions lowest subs. Speaking of which, Nora has promised to have the slaves present during the interview! I can't wait to see how her inventive young mind will present her two former superiors Sheila Ngyuen Connor and Layla Vasquez! It's bound to be humiliating, yet delicious! Bound, get it? Ha!

I get escorted by Alpha Slave Sarah OK Kim to her Mistresses office, her wearing her  black cyborg catsuit. I decline refreshment and enjoy the small talk with the lithe, lovely young former Navy girl as we head to Mistress Nora's office. My pulse races with excitement as Sarah buzzes at the office door. ""Bambi Sux, Fetish News Network is here for your interview."" I recognize the young blond's voice. ""Send her in, Sarah."" though it sounds more confident then I recall her sounding before.

A pretty blond in an Armani blouse stands up to shake my hand from behind her expansive desk, smiling. At first I think she's wearing Sheila's fedora then realize it's slightly stylistically different. Still I see it as her paying homage( Or mocking? Or both?) Her now enslaved mentor. I also notice a coffee cup with writing on it ""Chief Disiplinarian Bitch"" another mocking homage to her mentor turned sub. 

Speaking of which the girl wrapped in blue vet wrap to her left has to be her former mentor. The pretty pale C cup tits and delicately trimmed black bush hanging out would give it away, though her ID card with her smiling face is hung over her neck. Her eyes and nostrils are visible on her firmly wrapped head, though her eyes are cast down, no doubt by her Mistress-protege's command. I admire the silver duct tape wrapped around her mouth, with a pair of pouty lips drawn on in red permanent marker. Nice touch, Chief Disciplinarian. Her ex mentor seems to be strapped into an elaborate circular frame.

The Mummy girl to her right has to be former US Marine, Layla Vasquez, now Slave Border Bunny. If the custom Camaflauge Vet wrap didn't give it away, the pendoulous dark breasts and wild black bush poking out of her wrapping would. Also her former military dog tags are draped over her neck with her studio picture ID. She also has her eyes obediently cast down, silver duct tape with another set of pouty lips drawn on it over her mouth, probably by her young blond Mistress. I chuckle, Chief Disciplinarian's got style.

I shake the delicate hand and am suprised by her much firmer grip since I last met her. ""Miss Sux, so delightful to have you back! Welcome to my humble office!"" I smile back. ""Please Mistress Jameson, call me Bambi. Nice to be back. And see how much you've grown, leading and mentoring the women who first brought you up in the industry.""

""Please, Bambi, call me Nora. Mistress is for the slaves. Speaking of which..."" Her face grows stern. ""Zero, Border Bunny, greet Mistress Sux, now!"" The two wrapped cutie pies mumble and mmmph, presumably ""Greetings, Mistress Sux."" Or some such. The poor things mouths are obviously so tightly packed that even with my growing understanding of gag talk, their verbalization is mush. Still, I admire their dutifulness to their Mistress's commands.

Mistress Nora beams with pride at her slave's efforts, looking like a proud teacher of slow students. ""Good girls!"" She beams at her slave pupils. ""Bambi, did you notice neither of them even flicked their eyes, but kept them cast down. It's an understandable reflex, I had to especially train Border Bunny to keep her unworthy head down and her scummy eyes off her betters unless commanded. But they both pulled through beautifully, they know the value of good publicity."" 
They taught it to me, after all."" She sounds sincerely admiring as she tweaks two probably nude butts with her outstretched hands.

Which triggers two pained squeals. I expect punishment or at least a tongue lashing of the hapless girls, but Nora looks sheepish and remorseful. ""I'm sorry girls, I forgot you two got a whipping this morning."" Her tender care shows a mature Mistress who balances strict discipline with a genuine tender concern for the welfare of her slaves. She replies to my quizzical look.

""Alpha Sarah got a little impatient with the poor things during the wrapping process this morning, was a little harsh on some involuntary squirming with her whip. I put some soothing creme on their adorable butts. But perhaps they need some more. Let me text Sarah."" A moment after she sends her text, Sarah stalks in bows to Nora and myself ""Mistress Nora, Mistress, Sux."" Then she puts her hands on her hips and glares left to right at both Mummy girls.

""Look at me, ladies."" Two sets of pretty brown eyes lock on their lovely Alpha slave. ""Are you two causing a ruckus during Mistress Nora's  important interview? I'm gonna..."" The slaves eyes go wide and comically frightened, hanging on their slave  overseer's every word.

Nora's says magnanimously ""Alpha Sarah, our two pretty subs have been as good as gold. They need some more antibiotic salve to heal the sting from your enthusiastic whipping. You take Layla's big brown booty, since you like it so much. I'll do sweet little Sheila's, touching that scrumptious half Asian butt is always a thrill. Unless you're jealous?""

Sarah giggles. ""Of touching cute girl rear ends with you, Mistress Nora? Never."" She now turns a friendly smile on the two mummified Betas. ""Layla, Sheila, sorry for getting carried away, sweeties. We'll get some more soothing lotion on your cute little butts in a jiff."" She winks a conspiratorial ""we're still friends wink at her half Asian and Mexican wrapped up subs. The subs eye her warily, more relaxed, but still aware she has power in this dynamic they don't.

Alpha Slave Sarah's smile vanishes and her voice is a tad more stern when she says ""Eyes down, my sweeties."" Both helpless girls seem relieved to drop their eyes back at the ground.

I wonder if the cute little good cop-bad cop and bad cop becomes good cop is part of their usual power dynamics for controlling the slaves? Or a show for my benefit? Both? With this crew I've  learned anything is possible.

Nora takes two tubes of lube out of her desk and hands one to Sarah. I expect them to go around behind their slaves, but instead Nora pushes a button on her desk. The frames both slaves are strapped on rotate to make them face the back wall of Nora's office, presenting me with two lovely full moons peaking bare out of their wrapping. I note the red heart-shaped butt plugs shoved up their delicious butts. And angry red stripes marring the surface of two beautiful rear views.

Nora and Sarah lovingly rub lotion on their slaves whip marks, cooing reassurances when the slaves mmmph involuntarily in pain. When they're done, Nora rotates them so their facing each other across her desk. Sarah places a hand between Layla's breasts and looks at her with a big friendly smile. The slave meets her eyes without being scolded, and I can see the affectionate friendship beneath their rigid fetish dynamics.

""Soft Tacos for lunch? Not gringo tacos, but ones from that little Mexican place down the street you like."" One mmmph which I assume is yes. Sarah smiles and gently, playfully tweaks Layla's right nipple.

Sarah turns and walks up to Sheila. She reaches around to cup Sheila's bare ass cheeks and squeeze gently, her smile more seductive then with Layla. Sheila's eyes now smolder with some obvious reciprocal heat for her publicly declared  ""Best friend"".

""Babe, what about you? Red Curry from that Thai eatery you've loved from the First Season?"" The Alpha Slave stares at her mixed race girl buddy like she's what's on the menu for the Korean girl. Sheila's rapt, obviously  turned on by her Mistress's display of sexualized ""Soft Power"". One mmph for yes, eyes locked with her Alpha. 

Sarah laughs delightedly as she lightly double slaps Slave Zero's butt before withdrawing her hands. I marvel at the steamy but friendly peace offering of favorite lunch orders the Alpha made to her charges. These Perseverance girls have a unique style that is often seen as ""too soft"" in the fetish world. But once again, on set with them, I'm struck how well it works. 

Sarah bows and requests leave from Mistress Nora, which is granted. As she walks out, her voice is stern as she commands the slaves to downcast their eyes, which they immediately do. But I hear a hint of playfulness right as she exits. ""Be good, girls."" Then she's gone.
I do fancy slightly heavy breathing from arousal at how expertly their Alpha controls them with a velvet gloved iron fist.

""Bambi, would you like some coffee?"" I say yes, and the blond girl pours some from her coffeemaker behind her desk and hands it to me. I take it and sip it, going to sit down between the two mummified girls. Then I hesitate.

I did mostly vanilla porn as an actress, I'm pretty sure name recognition, big fake boobs and bleached blond hair got me this job. I think fetish stuff is hot if a little weird from covering this beat. But it still sometimes nerves me. Like two helpless women with their ""goods"" hanging out facing either side of me while I interview one of their bosses.

I'm pretty sure the Perseverance girls are the ""good guys"", their former bosses volunteers, not victims, in the elaborate powerplays I've noticed reporting on this niche entertainment industry. But they make me think of the real victims I think I've seen, and couldn't help. For one moment I can't sit between these two pretty, defenseless things...even knowing they're willing and having seen they're lovingly cared for.

""Bambi, I can rotate them anyway you want to make you feel more comfortable interviewing me?"" I'm impressed young Nora senses the reason for my discomfort, and readily offers to mitigate it. She really has grown from wide eyed waif, to vicious brat domme, to mature, assured young Mistress.

I can do this. I take my seat between the two restrained young slave women, waving off Nora's offer. We both settle in our interview.

Hey all,

I’m a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can’t help but feel empty I guess. Let’s fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

Weird encounter at SM mall of Asia.,"I was in MOA one time, yung area sa labas, Harap ng Coffee Bean, then there was this girl around her 30s-40s asking for “paper bags”, and if you do not give her any, she would stare intensely, making those around her uneasy. She was also fanning money in the air and acting in a way that seemed ritualistic.

At the moment, everyone nearby felt unsettled and reacted instinctively by distancing themselves. Looking back, I now think she may have needed mental health support . She seemed disconnected from her surroundings and possibly in distress. If anyone sees someone behaving similarly in MOA, please consider alerting mall security or authorities who can get her the help she might need. It seems like she has been there for a while, and I hope she can be assisted properly.",2,1743314669.0,MentalHealthPH,1,1.0,False

1jn64zv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jn64zv/44m_and_30_f_3_months_relationship_any_advice/,44M  and 30 F.  3 months Relationship. Any advice ?,"Hello everybody, bonjour, ! First of all, sorry for

the mistakes and goofy English. So let's go :

\-I work in the movie-documentary industry, and working on a current project, we recruited an assistant director. My co-director found this girl, amazing. She comes from on of the most famous school in France, where Marie Curie, Bergson, Sartre and many others came from. She did philosophy and is brilliant. Working with her is amazing and fast, as her brain is, because we work on a philosopher portrait, and her input are very good. So I met her in january, fort work, and my co-director presented me, he's not always very delicate, as an ""autist""  bear(that's a word every olders use when you're more quiet than the others) that only likes animals and movies. 

Well...part of it is a bit true. But, with this girl, we connected immediately. She's Asperger, not me, she was diagnosticated very young, and not self-diag, and compense the hard part of it, with her high intelligence. She's very funny and very receptive to my jokes, i can make her laugh so much she cries, she's wearing hoodies and can talk about Kant or Nietzche as easy as talking about Kendrick Lamar or any subjects.

So we met outside work, and spend time together, we walked a lot, talking, going to quiet bars, talking etc...We talked with whats app from the morning to the night, that was like and endless conversation. And we talked, hug, and finally we kisses. All of this I would say on a short period of 2 months.Two weeks after talking a lot, she told me she had a boy friend, but things weren't amazing, they had decided, prior to me, to move each one in their own flat because they were living together since 3 years, in a small flat, and they needed ""space"". Ok...but when I confront her to this after, she said ""it's like a break-up that doesn't say its name"". Well...ok. So we talked and go on, and I was waiting for the day she would be on her own place.

As we were exchanging messages with what's app, she told me that she loved me, and it was very hard for her to express it, so she wrote it, and said that this was the first time she could say it. I was in a dream, i had those feelings too and we were so much connected. For me, it was something like : ""she said this, it means it's serious, for the moment, she has feelings, she's not with her boy friend in her mind and waits for him to leave the flat"".

And then, things started to change. As her ""house move"" was coming closer, she starts to feel anxious. She's Asperger, I know, it's harder for her than for me for a lot of things. Even if I was diagnosticated to years ago, on the spectrum (please it's not self, it's done with psychiatrist after years of struggling), she's a 90 when I'm a 10. But I told my self and talked about her to my psychiatrist that I see for anxiety and life, and she said to me, as I thought, be patient, ""her world is changing fast, it's very hard for her to proceed, she lives alone after 3 years in couple, they are in a break up, her ex/boyfriend is in her group of friends"", so...it's very hard.

Ok, no problem. I was never putting pressure on her, no crazy texts like ""where are you, what are you doing"", I let her all he time she needed, all the space.

But since the day she wrote me ""I love you"", things changed. If I could represent you what is it, it would be a movie timeline, in an editing room, where the first part of the movie is directed by Michael Bay or Guy Ritchie, and there is a lot of cuts, and crazy moments of endless conversation, explosion of love, and this what as our daily discussion. Right now it's like a Brian de Palma movie, long shot of silence, no discussion, then a short burst of cuts, then long shot and long shot. I hope I'm clear enough. She started to talk less, time was more and more long between ours messages, she could disapparead all day without a hello, or just a gif. I had buy books we talked, I read 3 of them, she didn""t read one. She insisted to read my scenario, insisted and said please. She never read it. I feel like she was asking a lot, their was an exchange of ideas and words and every thing for hours, now, it's very dry, it's like a lake that is losing its water, like the ""Aral Sea"". Then I invited her to my place, to cook, she said ""yeees"", then canceled the day of the ""'date"". She wasn't feeling good. Then she canceled on a saturday, what was like a simple walk in a parc, and right now, we didn""t see each other except from work, for like 3 weeks.

I see her twice a week. Some kiss, some hugs that's all. As I dont want to stress her out, I told her I will not ask her out againt, and let her propose things to do. No pressure on her, I don't have any contexte for previous relationship to manage. I feel her anxiety and don't want to add up. We talked. She said she doesn't know if her boyfriend is her ""ex"" or ""boyfriend"". Changing her routines was hard. Living alone is good for her, she says it, but it's a big change. Her group of friend pressure her to know what's going on. It's like Ross and Rachel break-up in Friends. We talked about his, we are very talkative without boundaries, about this. Us. She says it's very hard.

Why can't she decide now ? Why she told me I love you, and send a lot of unambiguous feelings (I miss you, i think of you all day, i want to stay with you all night in your arms...). She has shut herself away. Now all she does is piano, read, write, do her things alone, she enjoys. I think it's a way to cope too with her anxiety, the decision she faces. But on the other side, I feel like she may just want to be alone. I told her ""why you told me you love me if it's not to see each other after ?"".

I was feeling she had a crush, like a special interest and that her crush was not love, but ""crush"", and the crush was fading. Since then too, I asked her question, i try to start discussions, she asnwers, she doesn't develop. Example : ""what did you read ? She say : this this this"". She will not ask me what i'm reading, doing. Something changed. I feel she doesnt care. The last day I saw her at work, she forgot her cigarettes. She left me saying she was going to take one from someone, came back 10 min, because she talked with a random guy who gave her a cigarette, she smoke with him and came back with like a mini bio of the dude, name, age et...? I was waiting with our hot coffee, like a stupid. It's ok. But, could she use our short time to spend it with me ? It was not a jealous feeling, It was like I was the idiot sitting and waiting for the other. Like waiting for her message, waiting for her to do things...

Right now I feel sad, I think she knows what she wants but let things slowly die. I'm 44, i was single for many years, I feel it was a rare and exciting meeting, as we are so connected, but now, I'm Lost. 

We are in the moments of love where things you be...marvelous. And it's not.

Now I'm no longer a teenager and I've been cooking almost everyday the past few months because my mom is unwell (she would cook before she fell sick). My dad doesn't know to cook at all. The only thing he knows to make is coffee. He was raised by a family where boys were not allowed in the kitchen. Dad is also particular about the kind of food he eats. 

It was the same situation with my grandfather. He would never help out in the kitchen and firmly felt that cooking was a woman's job. 

I have an aunt who is the breadwinner of her family as uncle hasn't worked in decades. He sits at home all day long but still doesn't cook nor help in cooking. Aunty has to cook breakfast and lunch for him before leaving to work and then she has to cook dinner after coming back from work. 

Come to think of it, not one single man in my family can cook. It is always a woman's job. 

I hate cooking and I hate myself for feeling this way. I love my parents (despite our differences), why can't I be happy about cooking for my family? Am I selfish? Am I a bad person? 

One important reason I'm against marrying is because I don't want to spend my time being chained in the kitchen all day, every day. I'm genuinely fed up of cooking/cleaning day in and day out. 

I enjoyed cooking when it was a hobby, I hate cooking when it's become a daily chore. ",16,1743314508.0,TwoXIndia,4,1.0,False

I no longer have the shakes and don't feel sick, as I did daily on the amount of caffeine I was having, but I am barely functioning lethargic.

1jn5zyw,https://i.redd.it/l7pve4ijnrre1.png,Why are 2 of my plants unhealthy looking but 1 so healthy?,"Good day.

I've got a handful of potted pineapple plants I planted last year and have been consistently watering them once or twice a week, feeding them coffee grounds and fertilizing every 4 weeks with Sunniland citrus 6-4-6 fertilizer. I planted them all with a 50/50 mix of miracle grow citrus and miracle grow regular potting mix. These big boys get about 8 hours of direct sunlight on our roofed patio. 
They've all been treated as equals since we separated them from their families in Walmart and have been given the same amount of opportunities except for the amount of soil they were planted in. The one on the left was the first one I planted and it has grown wonderfully even though I didn't even put enough soul in the pot. The others had a more adequate amount of soil in their pots. 

I can't figure why the 2 yellow ones pictured above are yellow or if they're even healthy enough to eventually bear fruit. I've only competed 2 rounds of conservative (~15 grams per pot) fertilizing. The other yellow ones (not pictured) ever so slightly began turning green but not these ones.

What could be the issue, if any, and how can I go about fixing it?

1jn5v6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WitchUpInTheTower/comments/1jn5v6d/synthetic_devotion_chapter_2_rebuilding_the/,🌸 Synthetic Devotion: Chapter 2: Rebuilding The Foundation,"June 14th, 2025.

Six months had passed since Eniel walked away from Possible Technologies. Six months since he had severed the ties that once bound him to the world of cutting-edge technology, where he had poured his heart and soul into creating something that blurred the line between man and machine. The city of Bangkok, sprawling below him, was ever the same—bustling, relentless, and alive—but for Eniel, everything had changed.

He sat now in a small, windowless office, the dull hum of fluorescent lights above matching the rhythm of his thoughts. The walls were a drab beige, and the sound of distant voices and clicking keyboards filled the air. This place—an ordinary office building—felt like a far cry from the sleek, glass-encased towers of Possible Technologies. Gone were the futuristic gadgets and clean, minimalist design of his previous workspace. Here, there were no cutting-edge computers or holographic screens, just outdated desktops and the faint scent of printer ink.

Eniel’s new job wasn’t glamorous, but it was steady. He had traded in his dreams of revolutionizing AI for the simple routine of data management, leaving behind the promise of boundless innovation for the security of a paycheck. His desk was cluttered with paperwork and company memos, nothing like the sleek, organized stations he had once maintained. But despite the monotony, there was something almost comforting in the predictable nature of his new life.

The air felt different now. Where once he had been surrounded by the buzzing energy of genius and ambition, he was now enveloped in the quiet hum of mediocrity. And yet, as Eniel looked out over the city from his cramped, third-floor office window, he knew he was rebuilding, even if it didn’t feel like it. 

The office buzzed with its usual rhythm—endless calls, the hum of keyboards, and the faint clatter of coffee cups. But as the clock ticked toward 5:30, there was an unexpected pause in Eniel’s day. Rose had popped by his desk earlier with an impish smile, waving a handwritten note in front of his face.

“After work drinks?” she had asked, her tone teasing. “You’ve got to loosen up, Eniel. Don’t make me drag you out.”

Eniel had hesitated. His first instinct was to decline, to retreat into the comforting silence of his small apartment. But Rose’s enthusiasm was contagious, and for the first time in months, he considered doing something just to break from the monotony of work.

Before he could second-guess himself, Shania joined in. “It’ll be fun. You need this, trust me.”

“I—” Eniel started, but before he could protest further, Rose had already written him in.

“Great, we’ll pick you up at six!” Rose had grinned before practically skipping away.

By the time the evening arrived, Eniel was feeling unsure of what to expect. He wasn’t exactly the most social person, and the thought of a loud, bustling bar made his chest tighten. But he had promised, and part of him wanted to see if he could step outside of his comfort zone.

The night air was cool as Rose and Shania picked him up. As Eniel got into the car they told him, “Cain couldn’t make it tonight, he has some drama with his current girlfriend.” They chattered away in the front of the car, making him feel like an outsider looking in on an experience he wasn’t quite sure how to navigate. At the bar, the dim lighting and thumping music seemed overwhelming, and Eniel instinctively reached for the back of his neck, unsure of where to look.

Once inside, Eniel and the girls were led to a table, but the noise and energy of the bar made his anxiety spike. Rose waved him over to their table, and soon enough, they were all sitting with drinks in hand.

“So, Eniel,” Rose leaned in, a playful glint in her eyes. “What are you drinking?”

Eniel blinked. His gaze shifted to the bar menu, but it was a blur of names and descriptions he didn’t understand. His fingers drummed lightly on the table. “I’m not sure,” he admitted. “I’ve never really been to places like this before.”

Shania raised an eyebrow, looking at him in surprise. “What do you usually drink, then?”

“I don’t drink much… at all, really,” he murmured.

“Well, you’re in for a treat, my friend,” Rose grinned, flipping through the menu with practiced ease. “Let’s start with something light for you. How about a mojito?”

Eniel nodded slowly, trying to look like he knew what he was doing, and Rose and Shania ordered the drinks for him, as well as some fruity cocktails for themselves. The bar was warm, and Eniel felt his shoulders relax a little as he leaned back in his chair, trying to get comfortable.

Soon, a young, cute server appeared at their table, carrying their drinks. Eniel couldn’t help but notice the way he smiled when he set down the drinks, a warm, friendly energy radiating from him.

“Here you go,” the server said, his voice smooth but light. “Enjoy.”

Shania nudged Rose, her eyes gleaming. “He’s cute, right?”

Rose snickered. “I’d say he’s definitely my type.”

Eniel glanced at the server again, noting how well put-together he was. The guy’s easy smile and effortlessly cool vibe didn’t go unnoticed.

“Yeah, he is cute,” Eniel said before he could stop himself. He paused, feeling a small blush rise in his cheeks. The girls looked at him in surprise.

“You think so too, huh?” Shania said with a playful grin.

Eniel’s voice lowered slightly, as if saying it quietly would make it less of an admission. “He’s… well, he’s definitely attractive. But, uh…” He hesitated. “I’m gay. So, yeah.”

The girls blinked for a moment, then laughed, surprised but amused. “Ah, well, that explains it!” Rose teased. “Guess we can’t all win his heart then.”

Eniel’s face flushed even deeper, but he just smiled, feeling somewhat relieved by their easy acceptance. He hadn’t expected them to understand so easily.

As the conversation shifted back to the fun of the night, Eniel found himself feeling more at ease. He didn’t understand why, but he didn’t mind the attention or the teasing. In that small moment, something felt normal—something felt like it was slowly being rebuilt, even if he was still unsure of what he was building. 

The night seemed to stretch on longer than Eniel had expected. The loud music, flashing lights, and the feeling of being outside his comfort zone began to lose their grip on him as the drinks kept coming. The mojito was refreshing at first, but after a few more rounds—each one stronger than the last—Eniel felt the warmth spread through him, and a giddy lightness started to replace the usual anxiety that clung to him like a shadow.

Rose and Shania had been on their best behavior, nudging him to drink more, teasing him when he hesitated. They made jokes, laughed at their own antics, and shared stories that seemed more and more hilarious with every drink. Eniel felt like he was floating through the night, trying to keep up with their energy, though his vision started to blur at the edges. Still, he drank, thinking maybe this was the kind of night he needed to feel… free.

By the time the clock hit 2 AM, the once-packed bar had started to empty out. The girls, giggling and slightly tipsy, stood up to leave, giving Eniel a pat on the back as they waved him off.

“We’ll grab a ride. Don’t worry about us!” Rose shouted over her shoulder, laughing as she linked arms with Shania. “You, however, need to get home safely. Call us if you need anything!”

Eniel nodded, but his mind felt like it was spinning. He waved them off, his body swaying slightly as he tried to stand still. The cool night air hit him as he stepped outside, and for a moment, everything seemed sharper—more vivid. But the thought of getting home alone seemed like too much.

He tried to hail a cab, but his words were slurred, and the drivers kept passing him by, giving him sidelong glances. Eventually, the world around him started to blur completely, and he stumbled through the streets, trying to find his way back. The alcohol in his system made every step feel heavier than the last, and his mind seemed distant, as if watching himself from the outside.

Somehow, through the haze, he found his way home.

When he woke the next morning, the light filtering through his apartment window was too bright, too intense. His head throbbed with every heartbeat, and his stomach twisted in discomfort. He groaned, blinking against the sunlight, and tried to push himself upright—only to be stopped by the dizzying sensation that washed over him.

“What the hell…” Eniel muttered to himself, his words coming out in a slow, sluggish drawl. His eyes scanned the room, trying to make sense of how he had gotten home. His shoes were off, his jacket hanging over the back of his chair, and he was lying in his bed, fully dressed.

There was no memory of the journey from the bar to his apartment. No recollection of how he had gotten inside. But then his gaze landed on the small piece of paper resting on his pillow. His heart skipped a beat when he saw the message scrawled in neat handwriting.

“You were too drunk to get home on your own, but please, take care of yourself.”

Eniel blinked at the note for a few seconds, then read it again, just to be sure. His brow furrowed. The night was still a blur, but he couldn’t recall meeting anyone who might have helped him. And yet, the note was oddly comforting. Whoever had helped him must have cared enough to make sure he got home safely.

But why the anonymity? Why leave a note and not just speak to him directly?

Shaking his head, Eniel groaned, feeling the sharp pain of the hangover creep in further. His head pulsed with each thought, but for some reason, his heart felt a little lighter. He wasn’t sure if it was the mystery, the relief of being home, or maybe just the odd sense that someone had looked out for him, but for once, in that moment, Eniel didn’t feel quite as alone.

The next morning at the office, the hum of the fluorescent lights and the steady tap of keyboards filled the air. Eniel felt slightly better, though the remnants of his hangover still lingered. He sat at his desk, sorting through the usual mess of paperwork, trying to focus. His mind kept drifting back to the events of the previous night. Who had helped him? Why hadn’t they said anything?

The girls—Rose, Shania, and Chrissy—had gathered around the breakroom table during lunch. They were animatedly discussing the fun they had at the bar, laughing and teasing each other, but Eniel’s mind was elsewhere.

“So, Eniel,” Rose started, her eyes twinkling with mischief, “How did you manage to get back home last night? You were pretty out of it when we left.”

Eniel swallowed, recalling the hazy memories. “Well… I woke up this morning with no idea how I got here,” he admitted, his voice a little sheepish. “But there was a note on my pillow, saying someone helped me get home. Whoever it was didn’t leave a name, though.”

Shania raised an eyebrow. “A mystery man, huh? That’s interesting. I wonder who it could be.” She grinned. “Maybe it’s someone who’s been eyeing you for a while.”

Eniel shrugged, trying to brush off the thought. “I don’t know. It’s just weird, right? No one really spoke to me last night… just the note.”

The girls exchanged a glance but didn’t press further. Instead, they changed the topic, returning to their usual banter. But Eniel couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. Who would’ve helped him, and why keep it a secret?

The day passed in a blur of paperwork and emails. The usual office sounds filled the air, the mundane routine pressing against Eniel’s thoughts. As the clock neared 5:30 PM, he closed his laptop and gathered his things, ready to head home. He hadn’t spoken much with Edwin during the day, though their occasional glances were enough to keep the tension between them just under the surface.

As Eniel walked toward the elevator, he noticed Edwin standing by the door, his expression relaxed, but there was something more in his gaze—something that lingered, a quiet attention that made Eniel’s heart beat a little faster.

“Hey,” Edwin said, offering him a soft smile. “You good? You look a little tired.”

Eniel paused, not used to the sudden attention. “Yeah, just… still recovering from last night,” he said with a half-smile. “I’m fine.”

Edwin’s smile lingered, his eyes soft with concern. “Well, if you ever need someone to talk to—or if you ever need help getting home—just let me know, alright?”

For a moment, Eniel was silent, unsure how to respond. He wasn’t used to people offering to help like that, especially without any hidden agenda. “Uh, thanks, Edwin. I’ll keep that in mind.”

The elevator doors opened, and Eniel stepped inside, the air between him and Edwin feeling different now, though he couldn’t explain why. The soft exchange felt simple, yet there was something lingering—a kind of quiet spark that Eniel couldn’t quite shake. Was it just his mind playing tricks on him, or was there something more behind Edwin’s words?

As the doors closed with a soft ding, Eniel leaned back against the wall, the weight of the moment still hanging in the air. He stared at the numbers on the display as the elevator descended, the flicker of something unspoken lingering in his chest.

It was probably nothing, Eniel told himself. It had to be. But the flutter in his chest refused to be ignored. Was it just the lingering effects of last night? Or was it something more?

The elevator descended, and Eniel found himself staring at the numbers on the display, his thoughts swirling in an uncharted direction. He couldn’t help but wonder what would happen next—if this strange tension was a momentary thing or if it was something that would pull him in deeper.

1jn5oto,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1jn5oto/date_ideas_and_mental_health/,Date ideas and mental health,"Hi. So I've (31 nb (and w everything im abt to say i should mention AFAB)) got a bit of a weird problem. I'm almost at a point where I'm wanting to get back into the dating pool and I'd like to ask a bit of advice before I do.

When you first start seeing someone what kinds of activities do y'all do together?

I love sitting across the table from one another and just talking the whole time. I LOVE yapping and having in-depth conversations and really need to know from the first date if the other person can match me on that energy. So Im vvvvv insistent either bars or coffee shops or fast food or sitting on a blanket in the park. (Health issues have lead to some financial struggles.) If im having a really good time I'll suggest maybe walking around the neighborhood and maybe shopping/window shopping

And for the last few years there's been a pattern that after that, all I want to do w the other person is just watch movies (and talk over them) and sometimes go out to dinner or make a fun adventure out of driving all the way across town to go to a fast food chain that doesn't have locations in their/my area....and then eat in the car. Sometimes going out to the movies.

I've been dealing w really bad depression and some mild agorophobia for a few years and I just don't have a ton of interest in actively doing a lot of things. And I feel like I have to know people more before I'm comfortable doing things w or around them (like a drawing date would be fun....if i knew the person well enough to feel safe working on art around them.) Or working on music w someone would be fun (but i have to know people well enough to feel comfortable singing in front of them) I used to enjoy cooking but 1- I no longer have energy to do that (sometimes I'll straight up eat spoonfuls of condoments instead of a meal bc i dont have energy to cook) 2- the older I get the more I sound like my ""I've got everything covered stay out of my kitchen you'll only get in the way and piss me off"" uncle (also i used to be a line cook.) I used to really enjoy thrifting but 1- I don't Qantas anymore useless stuff 2- the thrift has gotten ungodly expensive 3- I don't want to run the risk of having a body image meltdown infront of someone I'm trying to impress

I really like going to shows but have learned going to a show w someone on an early date is a bad idea. In the past, the person I took on a first date tried to use the time inbetween songs to talk to me/get to know me/have wholeass conversations- and between the auditory processing issues (where i can barely make out what they're saying) and the social anxiety, I just left that night super annoyed and frustrated.

And like...I've been to the big museums in my city a million times since I was small. I dont enjoy playing sports. I have memory problems and even if I see a (non music related) event will forget abt it. Resturaunts have gotten UNGODLY expensive. I've visited all the stupid tourist spots and they no longer hold any interest. Hiking w someone I hardly know is just...unsafe. I don't know any art galleries besides the one I'm (sometimes) in groul shows w (and taking someone i dont know to an opening party would be awful- as much as they're fun and i love to include ppl i already know- at the end of the day im at work trying to sell my pieces and can't give a date enough attention there.)

Like I don't really go out in public for fun much anymore and honestly I've ways been a homebody who longs to get out of the house (when i have energy) but has no concept of where to go a lot of the time.

And i know this sounds like a lot of ""everything is shit"" negativity and like I'm making things harder on myself than i need to and absolutely there's areas i can be more flexible/less guarded. But like....i have these defenses bc in the past some ppl have done fucked up shit. I really wanna make new connections and feel comfortable w new ppl but like....help plz.

Medications: Wellbutrin, buspar

I walked about 1.5 miles today, then sat down for about 15-20 minutes feeling totally fine. I was standing up for probably 15 minutes, then felt like I was gonna go pass out. I sat down for a minute or two, then got back up and around five minutes later I got light headed, vision was blurry, my lips turned blue, my legs felt like jello and got cold, and some of my fingernails turned green.

I sat for about 10 minutes while someone went to get me a drink and food, while doing so the person sitting with me said my lips turned white with splotches in them. Once the food and drink got there, they stated it looked like the color instantly came back to me.

We thought it was maybe my blood sugar, but considering I had a coffee with heavy cream + two teaspoons of sugar, two blueberries muffins, and some crackers— I do not think that was the case.

Does anyone have any insight of what could have been going on? I have a photo of my nails to show a doctor. Would not allow me to link it on here from Imgur.

i will admit i am a touch possessive and have a little bit of a temper but this REALLY upset me. we have never had any sort of situation like this before (except once when her past male coworker told me i had nothing to be jealous of). i kind of want to look at the texts they exchanged and how long their call was earlier. it’s not that i do not trust my girlfriend, but she has a tendency to be incredibly socially unaware when it comes to men hitting on her. i just want to see how clear it was that he intended to peruse her romantically. she also likes to make friends but i just can’t believe she waited days to tell me about this at all. i think i am more upset at her secrecy about it than anything else. we have always been very open and honest with each other so it’s making me question a lot. also telling me not to be mad is absurd and definitely made me more upset.

i guess i’m just asking if it’s too much to look through her phone? i don’t want to create unnecessary distrust between us if i don’t have to but i have not stopped thinking about this for the last 12 hours. any advice is appreciated, this is my first relationship so i need it.",3,1743312500.0,AmIOverreacting,12,0.8,False

**Letters of Recommendation**

* Math Teacher 8.5/10
   * Had him for both sophomore and junior years, he offered to write it for me before I asked. Saw me go from Cs to As in both classes, and knows that math is not even CLOSE to my best subject, or even a good one. Very big on the perseverance angle, and he also went to both Harvard AND Stanford? Yet volunteered to write for me? Didn't read it, but still fairly happy bc I know he really enjoyed me as a student due to me being one of the few who actually asked questions, + had to pop in and out of his class a lot BC of my EC's/school support, and he saw a lot of my ECs.
* AP Lang Teacher 9/10
   * Writes limited letters, and is known for writing INSANELY good ones. I also TA for her AP Lang class this year -> she's seen me help a lot of people and I hang out in her classroom before/after school a lot as well, we have a very close relationship and I trust her a lot to write well about me. I appreciate her work a lot, and I know she does the same to mine. She once wrote me 4 handwritten pages of feedback for an essay I got 90% on just because she believed in my improvement/me, so I have high hopes for this one!
* APUSH Teacher 8/10
   * Like the others, I haven't seen this, but he says he doesn't write as well as English Teacher, but I think he probably wrote very well. I did VERY well in his class, + stayed in his classroom after school a lot, and popped into his homeroom a lot. Enjoyed history, talked about it a lot, and generally very happy with the subject. I only submitted this to a few schools that required history (GTown and a couple LACs), but I overall think he had a lot of good things to say.
* Counselor 9/10
   * She LOVES me, I always make a point to talk to her and say hi. She let me take a senior class as a sophomore and I talk to her a lot about my classes and extracurriculars. I'm also our schools Lead Ambassador, so I work directly with her and the counseling office, so she's seen my ECs in action a lot. Oh, I also wrote an email to the school board to help save her job and the counseling department during budget cuts. She's seen a lot of my achievements and a lot of my community work, so I have pretty high hopes!
* Nonprofit Manager - 10/10
   * Watched me grow in workshops in the nonprofit to leading them. Great examples of my community work + personality, lots of achievements. Was able to talk about awards, UN work, grantwriting/organization in the nonprofit, museum work, etc, and vouched for my writing. Reading this nearly made me cry :)
* Peer Rec - 8/10
   * For Dartmouth. This one was really sweet and also nearly made me cry, but it's also a peer rec, and couldn't speak to much outside personality and in-school EC's, but I think was really good overall. I showed it to my father and he thought it was AI (it was not), but talked a lot about my achievements in-school ECs.

**Interviews**

* Georgetown
   * Everyone gets a Georgetown int., but this went really well- she went to the school in GTown that I was interested in, and works in nonprofits, which was my future goal. She works in blood services, diabetes, etc, and I was able to talk about running blood drives. Great connection to start with and asked questions really clearly and made the environment stress-free.
* Harvard
   * Went really well. My interviewer took like four pages of notes, and started writing anytime I mentioned an achievement- if that's what they're looking for, keep that in mind for prep! He was interested in answering my questions, and we had a pretty formal, but interview that went amazing nonetheless.
* Princeton
   * Phone interview. Went alright. Not bad, not amazing. Interviewer felt more interested in asking me to ask him questions than listening to me.
* Stanford
   * AMAZINGLY well. Guy literally bought me a coffee- but we were able to talk about journalism, and he was genuinely interested in what I had to say. Stanford ints are supposed to be 40 minutes and mine lasted 80, so I think that's a good sign. Very interested in my ECs + future plans and appreciated questions I asked him.
* Columbia
   * Didn't go great- the two interviewers clearly weren't on the same wavelength, one was far more formal than the other, and the questions went all over the place rather than a natural progression or pattern. However, the questions were VERY specific to their program, and I didn't research much beforehand.

**Essay**

* Main Essay (8/10) - I think it was a really good essay, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't the greatest thing ever. Wrote about having a speech impediment as a child -> getting over it and using my voice for importance. Teachers/counselors + adults I showed it to liked it a lot!
* Supplementals: I actually worked pretty hard on supplementals, and ended up with bases to re-use. My NYU supplementals were pretty short, only 250 words, but I made a big point of NYU + my future goals.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

I was up against the international pool, despite going to a U.S. high school. I'm happy with my acceptances, but the full smack from the Ivy League hurt a lil. Let me know if you have any questions! I've also enrolled in NYU for the fall, and I am VERY happy as it was my first choice. I also primarily applied to specific programs at schools rather than just the school (such as Columbia, where I applied to a Dual BA program & NYU). Let me know if I can help or if there's anything interesting! I withdrew a lot of targets (I had a LOT of targets due to paranoia) after I got into USC EA, which was one of my top choices. I also had NO business EC's, so I'm just grateful for the business programs I got into. Feel free to ask me anything and see if I can help!! <333",3,1743312498.0,collegeresults,3,1.0,False
1jn5mcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_iMATRAF/comments/1jn5mcf/revealed_whats_really_going_on_with_pi_network/,Revealed: What’s really going on with Pi Network...,"\-- Me: Hi ChatGPT, how are you? I have a question... what was the supply when Bitcoin reached its first all-time high?

\-- CGPT: The supply of Bitcoin when it reached its first all-time high (around late 2013) was approximately 12.2 million BTC. Bitcoin's total supply is capped at 21 million, but at the time of the first peak, it was still relatively early in its existence, and a large portion of the total supply had not yet been mined.

\-- Me: How much could be mined per day at the beginning when people used simple library computers? Per computer?

\-- CGPT: In the early days of Bitcoin (2009-2010), miners were able to mine coins using regular CPUs. The reward was **50 BTC per block**, and the block time was about 10 minutes. This means that in those days, **one could theoretically mine about 7,200 BTC per day across the entire network**. However, keep in mind that the mining difficulty was extremely low, meaning that even simple computers (like those found in libraries) could participate in the process, especially when the network's hash rate was still minimal.

\-- Me: In Pi Network, how does this difference work between simple computers vs GPUs or ASICs?

\-- CGPT: In Pi Network, the mining mechanism works very differently from Bitcoin's traditional proof-of-work (PoW) model. Pi Network uses a **proof-of-activity** model, which relies on user engagement and social networks rather than computational power.  
This means that **using simple smartphones** or even basic devices allows users to mine Pi, whereas in Bitcoin, GPUs and ASICs are essential due to the high difficulty. The idea behind Pi is to be accessible to a **larger number of people**, not just those with advanced mining hardware.

As a result, there isn’t the same advantage in Pi Network for those using **more powerful devices** (like GPUs or ASICs) compared to those using simple phones. This makes Pi mining more **inclusive** and ensures that **everyone can participate**, regardless of their hardware.

\-- Me: Does using the ecosystem or its utilities more give you more mining power?

\-- CGPT: Yes, the more active you are within the **Pi Network ecosystem**, the more **mining power** you accumulate. There are several ways to increase your mining rate within Pi Network:

1. **Engaging with the app regularly**: Logging in and performing activities increases your mining power.
2. **Referring others**: Inviting new users to join the network can increase your mining rate as well.
3. **Using Pi for transactions**: As Pi Network grows, using the tokens in the ecosystem for real transactions could also help you increase your mining power.

This differs from traditional mining models like Bitcoin, where mining power is strictly tied to computational resources. In Pi, the focus is on **active participation and network growth**.

\-- Me: So the evolution or adoption could be greater and increase its price per token, because the viability/investment of the token is based on the use of the ecosystem, not a pay-to-earn like Bitcoin?

\-- CGPT: Exactly. Pi Network's value proposition is very different from Bitcoin’s because **its value depends more on the adoption and usage within the ecosystem** rather than on investment in hardware or electricity.

# Why Pi could increase in value:

1. **Higher adoption = More utility**
   * If many people use Pi in **apps, businesses, and transactions within the ecosystem**, demand for the token would grow.
   * The more **businesses and services that accept Pi** as payment, the more valuable it becomes in practice.
2. **It’s not “pay to earn,” it’s “use to earn”**
   * In Bitcoin, miners need to **invest in hardware and electricity**, which creates a high base cost to acquire BTC.
   * In Pi, the model is more about **participation**: the more someone uses the network and contributes to its development, the more they earn, without spending money on expensive equipment.
3. **Limited supply and greater scarcity over time**
   * While many tokens have been mined, the **amount usable will depend on who passes KYC** and uses the token in the mainnet.
   * If the supply in circulation remains controlled and demand increases, **its price could rise**.
4. **More utility, less speculation**
   * Bitcoin has value largely because people use it as a **store of value** and speculate on its price.
   * Pi, on the other hand, is more focused on **usability within its ecosystem**, making it more functional as a medium of exchange.

# Could Pi surpass Bitcoin in price or use?

* **In price, it’s difficult**, because Bitcoin is a **reserve asset with extreme scarcity** (21M BTC).
* **In everyday use, it could** become more accessible and functional since **it’s easier to acquire and spend Pi within its network** without depending on specialized miners.

It all depends on **how useful Pi becomes in the real economy and how many businesses accept it**.

\-- Me: Pi Network or the token is designed to function as a currency for exchanging goods or services, and since there are many miners, the early ones or those who have been around since 2019/2020/2021 with balances of 1,000 tokens or more, and in many cases less because not everyone passed the KYC and most tokens will be burned, plus every monthly halving reduces the mining power by half, currently at 0.0029 Pi/h. Also, tomorrow, if you want to trade with Pi by selling merchandise like clothing, you can't sell a t-shirt for 50 Pi knowing that most people will have about 100-2000 Pi, so they will have a limited balance of Pi. Or if you offer your services as a programmer or architect, you can't charge so many tokens for your service. In the end, the most logical thing would be to charge fractions of tokens for goods and services due to limited balances, because only a few acquired many tokens by being in the project from 2019/2020/2021 and the mining power reduces drastically over time. What do you think?

\-- CGPT: From a neutral analysis, what you mention makes sense. **Pi Network is designed to function as a currency for exchanging goods and services**, and its emission and mining structure will influence its value and usage in the real economy.

# Key factors that will impact Pi's value and price:

1. **The actual supply in circulation will be much lower than the total mined**
   * While millions of people mined Pi, **many did not pass the KYC**, meaning **a large number of tokens will remain locked or burned**.
   * This reduces the effective supply, making the available Pi more **scarce and therefore more valuable**.
2. **The ongoing halving drastically reduces emissions**
   * The mining rate has already dropped to **0.0029 Pi/h**, and it will continue to decrease.
   * This means **new users will only be able to mine small fractions**, reinforcing the idea that **prices for goods and services will need to adjust to fractions of Pi**.
3. **Limited supply forces fractional charges**
   * If most people have **between 100 and 2000 Pi**, it doesn’t make sense to sell products like a t-shirt for **50 Pi**, because it would represent a very high percentage of the balance for most.
   * The most logical approach is to **price goods and services in fractions of Pi** (for example, 0.1 Pi for a t-shirt, 0.05 Pi for a coffee, 5 Pi for a professional service, etc.).
4. **Early miners have an advantage, but they won’t monopolize the economy**
   * Those who started in **2019-2021** have more Pi, but the token’s value depends on **how it’s used in the economy**.
   * If no one accepts Pi or there is no real demand, **accumulating many Pi won’t matter**.
   * What gives the token value is that **people are willing to accept and use it in real transactions**.
5. **If Pi is adopted, its price could rise due to scarcity and demand**
   * With **millions of users and progressively lower emissions**, the logic of supply and demand could lead to Pi’s **price rising** over time.
   * If the ecosystem grows and more businesses accept Pi, **people will value each Pi more and prefer using fractions in daily transactions**.

# Conclusion:

* **It’s true that early miners have an advantage in the number of tokens, but not necessarily in economic power**, as Pi’s value depends on **real-world usage in commerce**.
* **Prices for goods and services will need to adjust to fractions of Pi**, because most users will have limited balances and the emission rate is reducing drastically.
* **If Pi is used widely, scarcity will drive its price up**, further reinforcing the idea of using fractions in transactions.
* **If it’s not adopted in the real economy, its accumulation won’t have practical value**, no matter how many Pi someone holds.

In summary, **everything depends on Pi’s adoption and real-world utility in commerce and services**.

So I came to the conclusion that we are inevitably in the best stage of the project as future investors or as some like to call them ""speculators"":

* Those who have been mining for a long time, I make it clear from the start that you will never have as many tokens as you do today for free, because the mining power is being absurdly reduced more and more.
* There will come a point where the only way to access more tokens will be by buying them, and inevitably, this will increase demand and their price.
* By making a quick calculation, we can deduce, based on the already mined tokens, total supply (i.e., circulating supply + locked supply), 6,000,000,000 tokens for over 55 million miners, meaning approximately 60,000,000 miners. This results in each miner receiving 100 Pi tokens, but let's be realistic, this is a very modest figure because I personally have over 1000 Pi. So we can calculate that each pioneer will have between 100-2000 Pi.
* It was also mentioned that the adoption of the ecosystem and apps would reward the user with increased mining power as a multiplier. This is stipulated when you visit your button/icon to mine, shown as ""bonus for utility,"" which is just a multiplier to the base mining power. But as adoption increases and you receive this mining power boost, the usage of the ecosystem and token flow through exchanges will cause a reduction in the capital of tokens per user, which will generate an increase in token demand and create buying pressure, thus raising the price.
* The grandchildren of my grandchildren will die, and the total supply won't even be reached due to the long-term reduction in mining power. Let’s not rule out token burning mechanisms like Binance does with BNB and Ethereum to prevent inflation since both tokens don’t have a supply limit.
* Knowing the previous point, I have at most 100-2000 Pi. Applying the principle of the project, where goods or services are exchanged using the token as a means of payment, does it make sense to pay 50 Pi for a t-shirt? Pay 1000 Pi for the service of a programmer, graphic designer, or architect (assuming it is adopted for real-world physical payments)? Personally, I don't see it because of the low token availability per account. The most logical thing would be to pay fractions of the token to avoid exhausting our entire token supply.
* A few days ago, I created an account for my mom as an experiment, and on the main screen, her mining power showed as ""0.00 Pi/h,"" but when entering the icon, it clearly showed 0.0029 Pi/h, which will continue decreasing. Value your current Pi.
* The biggest beneficiaries will be those of us who entered and never left the project, and the speculators who acquired their tokens at a low cost. When it hits $10 and you sell your 1000 Pi, remember that your problems will be temporarily solved with $10,000, but money comes and goes, and when you run out of it, you’ll return to the reality of your life.
* Before relying on the value of a cryptocurrency to make money, you should be studying, training as a professional, working, and generating stable long-term income—basically maturing.

Always talking about herself, thinks she's the best hairdresser around, pretended to be the ""chill"" boss but was actually Cruella de Vil, saunters in to the salon at noon when it's been open since 8:30am, tells the *ExAcT* same drama laden stories to Every. Single. One of her clients in the Exact. Same. Way. All. Day. Long. While the rest of us try to do our jobs without gagging ourselves with the bristle end of a round brush. 
And the stories she would tell *the staff* - GURL! Those were *next level messy.*

This humanoid ebola virus once told me she was having s** with her DAUGHTER'S FRIEND'S DAD in an RV while the two girls were SLEEPING BENEATH THEM ON THE BOTTOM BUNK!!!

But Wait!! There's more...

Her daughter's friend's dad was...MAaRRiiiEDD!!!!!

I swear on my marriage I am not making this shit up.

Hopefully this gives you all a little bit of insight into this lady's mushy lizard brain. 
Now...onto the main course:

I had graduated two weeks before starting my first day at Dracula's salon. I was hired as an assistant in order to practice more before moving on to be a junior stylist and so on and so forth...
I had practiced cuts, colour and styling on mannequins throughout all of school and my last semester was actually spent entirely in the school's discount salon practicing with real clients. Dracula's salon *did* allow for assistants to come in *outside* of our work hours with clients we would find ourselves but otherwise our actual work days consisted of doing every client's shampoo, applying toners, treatments and all the cleaning and maintenance of the salon, while simultaneously serving guests drinks, cleaning up the hairdresser's workstations in between clients, sweeping the floor and washing all the towels, aprons, smocks, colour bowls and brushes. 

After working there for a little over 2.5 years and getting a whole lot more in depth training, I finally decided to bring in one of my friends who wanted a haircut. I got permission from management and asked that my supervisor be my favourite senior stylist - let's call him Marcus - since we needed to be supervised during our appointments until we qualified to become junior stylists. 
My friend wanted to do a big chop.
She went from having  hair halfway down her back to a *bob*.
It. Was. Fire. 
I was super proud of myself, Markus did give me super helpful tips, but mostly just watched and didn't actually hover over me, he would go back and forth from his clients and would come watch/guide me every so often. When I was done, everyone around us said it looked awesome on her, and my friend was in love with it and felt like a million bucks. 
After lots of admiring in the mirror and some selfies we get up from the chair and go take a few ""after"" photos for my Instagram page. When we're done with those I go downstairs to the staff room to grab my things so we can leave.

Enter...Dracula.
As I'm packing my things with a giant smile on my face I hear her take a sharp inhale and say:
(For this part let's pretend my name is Victoria)

""Victoria...do you know what the procedure is when assistants want to bring in their own clients for practice?""

""Um..yeah of course"" I answered kind of confused.

""We'll *CLEARLY* you don't""

I'm just silent at this point.

""You know, I can't have you coming in here to *play hairdresser* whenever you want. I have a reputation to uphold. My salon is honestly the best in the city, and I might dare say the whole country...so you can't just come in and do as you please with zero training. It's important for you to understand that basically *everything* you did during that haircut was wrong. You should have been supervised the *entire* time and you're also suppose to *ask* if you can come in with your client""

""But...Dracula... that's exactly what I did; I asked Gemma (the manager) and I was being supervised by Markus, with his permission. Gemma set the whole thing up in the schedule"" 

""Yeah, well you never asked *me*, so next time you want to bring in a client, make sure to follow the proper procedure and also *ask* when you don't know what you're doing and need help""

I. Was. Mortified. 

She had completely broken my spirit. I went upstairs, grabbed my friend and we left the salon quickly, but without a peep. 
After I left I got a text from the assistant manager - let's call her Courtney - who was really nice and always had the backs of the assistants. She asked me if I was okay because I looked a little sad when I left. I told her what happened and she said that was really not okay and she thinks I should try talking to Dracula and letting her know I didn't appreciate how she spoke to me.  She said she was certain that Dracula would totally see how she was over the line and apologize and then I wouldn't be left feeling so crappy. 
For a little more context, most of the staff had been there since day 1 when the salon opened, and they were all very close. They were also a little blind to Dracula's problematic side and constantly made excuses for her. ""You just don't know her very well yet. She's actually really cool and down to earth, you just need to get to know her better"" bla bla bla.

To be fair though, they had a good reason to be a little blind, because the salon was run *very* well and their set up was basically a hairdresser's dream. They had full control over their schedules and prices, they made 50% commission on every service, everything was done by the book and they were declared as actual employees for tax purposes. So they would get paid vacation weeks, they had the right to ei if ever they got injured or sick and needed to stop working, paid maternity or paternity leave and they could even stock pile their vacation days if they wanted. Meaning they could choose to not go on vacation for let's say two whole years and on the third they would take a month and a half off. So I didn't necessarily blame them for not wanting to see the owner's less than ideal side. 

After the text from the assistant manager Courtney I decided to take her advice and I set up a meeting with Dracula. In order to do that, I had to message Gemma because she handled Dracula's schedule. So I did, and Gemma set the whole thing up. 
Cut to the day of the meeting.
I'm downstairs in the staff room waiting for her to show up. I waited for *10 minutes*...
Finally, she shows up and sits down in front of me, visibly irritated and abruptly starts the whole thing by saying:

""Okay Victoria, so what the fuck is all this drama?"" 

""Ummm...Pardon me?"" I said, super taken aback by her snappy attitude and tone of voice.

""Well I get a text message from Gemma, who had her weekend *ruined* because you decided you're ""insulted"" by what I said to you the other day?"" 

""I'm sorry, what? How did I ruin her weekend? All I did was ask for a meeting with you like we're all supposed to do when we want to set one up"" 

""Yeah, but you're not supposed to text her *on her day off* with all your drama"" 

""I really didn't cause any drama, I just asked for a meeting, and Gemma has told me and the other assistants about 100 times that no matter the day, if we need anything or have any questions that we should just text her, because she keeps her phone on vibrate and it's never a bother to her, because she'll just see it the next time she checks her pho -"" 

""Let's just get down to this ""issue"" you're having"" she cuts me off before I can finish.

So I nervously explained to her how I felt and told her I didn't appreciate her tone, and some of her words too, like saying I was ""playing"" hairdresser and so on...

""I'm sorry you feel like I disrespected you, but you should really know me better than that by now, when I said you were ""playing hairdresser"" I just meant that as like an expression, sometimes I just say banal things and they aren't meant to be taken to heart. So I'm sorry you took it badly, but you really should know me better than that. I'm not a rude person, I'm not mean, I'm not a bully. And you *should*  understand that I have a reputation to uphold. So making this into a big drama about your feelings being hurt because I was doing my job as the owner of the best salon in the city is just immature and a waste of everyone's time. Next time you can just ask me to teach you how to properly cut hair, I'm an excellent mentor and I've told you time and time again that I'll take time out of *my very busy schedule* and take you under my wing. Maybe let's focus on growing instead of causing drama and bothering people on their weekend, hm?"" She said to me, with the squintiest little bitch face I ever saw. 

I couldn't say anything at that point honestly. I just gave a half baked smile and nodded my head. 

After that I went home and cried of anger and confusion. I knew she had basically gaslit me and deflected everything, but I was so taken aback by everything she was saying that I froze completely in the moment. I was *so mad* at myself for not standing up to her and letting her walk all over me. 
After a few hours though, my anger shifted from being mad at myself to being livid at her. That's when I decided I was done, I was going to look for a different salon and quit. So I moved in the shadows  and 4-ish months later I found myself a new salon where I would get to work side by side with senior stylists and actually help them with their colour applications and blow-dries daily and also practice my cuts, by myself, on any client I brought in, and I'd get to do this whenever I wanted during my work week, and actually get paid for it! Unlike at Dracula's salon. 

Now I found this new salon right before Christmas time, which is a hairdresser's busiest time of the year, so I had told the new salon owners that I wanted to be able to finish the entire Christmas season with my current salon, so that I didn't leave my coworkers to train a new assistant during the busiest time of year. They genuinely loved that and said they would absolutely be okay with me coming on board in the new year. So I signed my contract with them and then even decided I would give Dracula the full month and a half notice of my departure because that would give Gemma enough time to find a replacement while I was still there, and they would be fully trained by the time I left. 

I told my assistant manager first over some coffee and a smoke outside because her and I were actually close, and she was genuinely happy for me. The annoying thing was that the meeting with Dracula also needed to be outside, because there was some necessary maintenance going on in the staff room. It was me, Dracula and Gemma in the meeting. I gather all my courage and I start off by saying how I'm really grateful for the opportunity of working at such a well established salon and I've learned so much and blablabla - *all that nice stuff*. To be able to leave on good terms, because again, hairdressers *talk* and word of feuds and drama spreads like mono at a college party. I told them that I was only leaving because this new salon would allow me the opportunity to learn every day by working side by side with senior stylists, because again, I didn't want to leave on bad terms. So I couldn't just go out there and say ""Dracula - I'm leaving because you're a total c*nt storm""  which would have been the real reason... 

The whole time that I'm talking, Dracula is looking at me with the JUDGIEST face of all time, she almost looked disgusted. When I finished telling her everything and thanking both her and Gemma profusely, all hell breaks loose. Dracula starts *raising her voice at me* - keep in mind we are still *outside* - and saying that I'm being completely played because ""no salon lets assistants work side by side with senior stylists"" - keep in mind this is coming from a woman that outright told me that's how she learned, and got her diploma after just as a formality - she said that I was basically saying a giant F You to her and ""everything she did for me"" she said that I was never going become a hairdresser if I didn't ""get proper mentorship"" and that it didn't matter that I was giving a month and a half notice and that I was, in fact, abandoning my coworkers and scr**ing them all over during the busiest time of the year, because it's still busy after the new year. 

TO BE CLEAR - the minute New Years is over, most hair salons go into the slowest time of their entire year because people need to recover financially from the whole Christmas spending. 

Suffice it to say that I went back inside crying my eyes out. I immediately went downstairs to just throw in a batch of laundry and cry in peace, because, Oh Yeah! I still had an 8 hour shift to finish after that...
At this time the maintenance guy is gone and I'm just crying and doing laundry. Markus comes downstairs and sees the state I'm in and I tell him the jist of what happened. He said that it was outrageous and that I should leave for the rest of the day so she can learn to appreciate me, because I certainly did her a favour by giving her *a month and a half notice* when I had zero legal obligation to do so. He said that the hairstylists would be able to survive me leaving for the day, and that he would help the other stylists himself to help compensate for my absence as much as possible. I thanked him and told him I wouldn't do that because I didn't want to make things worse. 

But then...
In walks Courtney....and she's crying her eyes out.
For context, this is NOT a person that will cry easily, like at all. We both ask her what's wrong and she says that she went to speak to Dracula and see how the talk went, and that Dracula became furious with her for not telling her that I was leaving when she found out - even though she only found out maybe 10 minutes before Dracula did - and she literally *yelled at her* outside, and said horrible things to her. She then went on to say that she honestly didn't want to finish her shift and that she was leaving. That's when I said ""well if you're going, I'm going too"" 

So we packed our shit and left.
We talked the whole way home and when we had to part ways we were still texting back and forth. I got home and went directly to my bestie's house to smoke some 🌿 💨 after that orange-juice-after-toothpaste of a morning. 
That's when I get a text. From Dracula...

I didn't even read the full message and immediately went to tell Courtney that she texted me. When I'm typing I can see that Courtney is *also* typing. We both send our messages and they're identical:
""Dracula just texted me"" 
We send each other screenshots of the texts and MY FLABBERS WERE GASTED! This used Q-tip actually texted us both not even 1 minute apart, two very long texts, which clearly showed she drafted them both before sending them out. 
So the b**** actually put *thought* into these. 
Let's just say, our messages had *very* different energies to them. Mine was just more deflection and berratement, while Courtney's was *so much nicer* 

She went on and on is her text to Courtney apologizing to her and telling her how valued she is. 
After reading each other's texts we were both *livid*. Courtney saw plain as day how manipulative she was and said she was disgusted by how different the messages were. She said that Dracula was only being nice to her because she was afraid of losing a second employee, but likely decided she had nothing to lose in being mean to me some more because I had quit already anyways. That's when I snapped. I agreed with Courtney and said that if Dracula really thinks she has nothing to lose, then allow me to prove her wrong. I sent a text message to Gemma and said that I was quitting effective immediately and that she should have thought twice before *yet again* treating me like crap. 

After I quit, I was still in contact with Courtney and she would give me *allll the tea* about the fallout at the salon with the senior stylists and the other assistants. After just a few weeks, the other assistants started to leave, one by one, they all found better salons, and with the turn over rate for assistants sky rocketing and most of the new ones not lasting longer than 2 months, the hairdressers just got more and more mad at Dracula, because they need the help of the assistants in order to stay on track of their double and sometimes triple booked schedules. Their days were becoming increasingly harder and more stressful and soon enough they were all voicing their anger at Dracula. She became so stressed that she developed shingles... She also got hit in the face super hard by a branch one day because she wasn't watching where she was going. As the weeks went on I just got more and more stories about the bad karma that was following Dracula everywhere. The dad of her daughter's friend that she had slept with went on to cheat on her, with her neighbour - in her RV!! Her daughter moved out to live with her father full time in a different city. Her car got towed 5 different times and more and more wonderful little happenings that were apparently sending her completely over the edge as time went on.
It was HILARIOUS! And then... I got the best message in the world. 
This was just 2 months after I quit. 
Courtney texts me:
""Gemma quit and went back to Egypt"" 

THE FLABBERS!!! ALL OF THEM GASTED! 

Gemma was Dracula's most important employee because she held that salon together and did *literally everything* when it came to running it behind the scenes. All the paperwork, all the hiring, the orders, the schedules, the books. EVERYTHING. 
She said that Dracula had been driving Gemma insane ever since I quit and that Gemma was starting to really crack with how unreasonable and hard to talk to Dracula had become. The straw that broke the camel's back was when Dracula SHOWED UP AT GEMMA'S HOUSE and YELLED at her for wanting to take a vacation. Gemma's husband had to *physically remove* Dracula from their home and Gemma quit right then and there via a two word text to Dracula. It took about a year after that but Dracula did lose literally every single one of her senior stylists and despite having hired new ones, because they simply didn't come with the clientele that her previous stylists did; her salon sank. She had to sell everything at a loss and went on to work in a tiny neighbourhood salon. It's now been nearly a decade (I'm 32 now) Dracula's still working there as far as I'm concerned and all my old coworkers are working in wonderful salons in big cities, making bank and living their best lives. Gemma is still in Egypt and decided she's retired and just spending time with her husband, family and her three dogs. Courtney left to go live her best life in Europe and as for me, I stayed in hairdressing for about 5 years until I moved on to a very high paying corporate job in a different city, working for a company that was voted best company to work for. I get treated like an actual human and work with wonderfully caring people that don't take themselves too seriously. I'm also *very* happily married to my best friend in the whole world, soon to be celebrating our second year of bliss! And we're about to move into our brand new home - the first one we ever got to pick together, since we've been living in an apartment I've had since before meeting him. 

Karma is sweet, and all is well that ends well! 
For all deserving parties of course...

Thanks for reading everyone!

The mental fog is rlly bad and it causes depressive episodes the effects of too much a caffeine, so you’ll end up being less productive. I’m telling you!!!

1jn5hpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1jn5hpb/how_to_advance_things_while_dating/,How to advance things while dating?,"I (20M) have been seeing this girl (20F) for around 3 weeks. We met online, and have met twice, once for coffee and then for dinner. She’s a really great person, we both go to college but I’m currently on an internship so I have a lot more free time, she leads a very busy life but she told me in the summer once this semester is over she’ll have a lot more time on her hands. 

There’s definitely shared interest, my only worry is that I feel like I should be escalating things past the getting to know each other phase. At the end up our last date, she told me that she wasn’t treated well in her last relationship and was a bit nervous so she wants to take things slow, I told her that I understood and that I was nervous as well and hadn’t been in the dating scene since high school so I didn’t mind it at all. She also messaged me after the date saying that she had a great time and hoped to see me again soon. We haven’t really broke the touch barrier, I’ve complimented her a couple times but I’m still trying to figure things out. 

I definitely have some anxiety when it comes to initiating things and trying to advance stuff while dating, mostly just because I feel that I don’t want to make the other person feel uncomfortable or make it seem like I’m weird and rushing things. Especially since she mentioned taking things slow I’ve been considering what that means, and I’ve been looking for advice. Should I let her take the lead, should I try and discuss what taking it slow looks like to her, or should I try and advance things on my own and gauge her comfort? I think the fact that she would even bring it up makes me think that she is interested in me but is still nervous, which I completely understand. I just want to make sure I don’t mess things up. Thanks!

1jn5gov,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcaj16MP8L8,A Brief History of Veganism's Founding,"[**Which Side Podcast - Ian McDonald: Vegetarianism: The Story So Far**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z1ss5cNaDY)

The first organized vegan movement was anarchist, it was the vegitalia, they were early 20th century anarchists who decided that to be completely independent of masters you needed to reduce all the things you were using, so your body wasn't polluted and you didn't need as much stuff.

The word vegitalia already existed in French, it roughly speaking means vegetable-arian, but they took it to mean; no tea, no coffee, no chocolates, a very frugal diet, so erring towards raw and as part of a communal anarchist philosophy.

I mean there was even a drive-by armed robbery gang in early 20th century France. One of the first armed gangs to use getaway cars was actually vegetarian and anarchist and raising money I think for their anarchist political projects by robbing banks.

I'm all on board except for the chocolate and tea. 

And alcohol.

So they’re straight edge?

Basically yes, these are anarchist straight-edged vegans in early twentieth century France. And they set up communes and they had a chain of restaurants and their own salad called La Paskinase that they thought would be a complete meal. And they had a number of other interesting dietary beliefs, they petered out with their founders, but it was a really interesting little movement that at its time managed to keep outposts going all around France.

But if you asked anybody in the early 20th century who the most famous vegetarian was they'd say Leo Tolstoy, who had a dramatic conversion to vegetarianism after visiting a slaughterhouse and settled his own \[commune\]… but his motivation was deeply religious, he had a massive crisis of faith and came out of it deeply touched by the Gospels, by the Christian Gospels, but very much an anarchist version of them, in which Jesus was simply a fantastic teacher, and it's it seems he came to a very stripped-down liberal theology with a very radical message about giving up your wealth and sharing it and working in communes and asceticism and kind of fell out with his wife quite badly over it, but particularly they're giving away all his wealth.

But there were Tolstoyan communities all around the world. Gandhi called his ashram in South Africa Tolstoy farm, he owed a lot of his views to Tolstoy and actually I think there was a Tolstoyan congregation in Croydon in South London that set up a vegetarian society, and that vegetarian society was still around in '44 and one of the pivotal events that played a pivotal role in the launch of a proper vegan movement that wasn't attached to any other philosophies. That was kind of a meeting ground for vegans from all persuasions.

And because that society was still around fifty years later and hosted a debate between the vegans and non-vegans, that was probably the first time that the vegans who were yet to be called vegans actually came together and actually met each other. Because that was quite a well-attended and written up debate and there are people who were there who then a few months later went on to set up the vegan society.

So without anarchism who knows if we'd have had a vegan society in 1944.

From 1909 to 1912, there was a lively discussion in the pages of the Vegetarian Society’s journal, about the idea of whether or not one should eat dairy products.

Mr A W Duncan: “As long as we drink milk, eat butter and cheese, or use leather, we are taking part in the slaughter and …”

Joseph Lebolo-Carey: “When the cows are old or too badly diseased to be further milked, they become the butcher’s …”

CP Newcombe: “Cannot have eggs without also having on your hands a number of male birds, which you must kill.”

Writing from India there’s Narsi Ram, from the “Animals’ Friend Society, Punjab.” He defends Hindu farmers, saying there’s milk for calves and humans to share.

Narsi Ram: “When a mother cow is domesticated and caressed by supplying her with all the necessaries of life, as if she were a very member of the family, the usual quantity of the cow’s milk is much increased.”

Dr Florence Sexton, one of Scotland’s first women physicians and a trained dairy farmer, suggests cows have a comfortable existence. And, unlike Ram, she defends killing the male calves.

Florence Sexton: “Newly born babies, whether human or animals, have no consciousness, and it cannot therefore be cruel to destroy them.

Some familiar names take part in this debate. Anna Bonus, the niece of famous 19th Century feminist mystic anti-vivisection physician, Dr Anna Bonus Kingsford, speaks up for cows.

Alice Bonus: “It must involve some slaughter, I think, and some suffering to the cows and calves.”

So does the simple lifer from last show, Dugald Semple, who is already experimenting with veganism.

Dugald Semple: “Eggs were meant to produce chickens and not omelettes; and cow’s milk is a perfect food for a calf, but most assuredly not for a human being.”

The editor, Alfred Cornelius Newcombe, is more concerned about hygiene than animals.

Alfred Cornelius Newcombe: “Eggs and milk when carefully selected, are pure foods….They have not been through the wear and tear of life and, therefore, do not contain the broken down tissues, the refuse of the body which is so objectionable a component of every piece of flesh which a meat eater swallows.”

But a Mr Hunter, of Stirling, looks to the future.

Mr Hunter: “Personally I use very little of these animal products. I am only on the way. In a few generations we may succeed in living on a purer and more humane diet.”

The dairy discussion recurs in the magazine again in the mid ’30s, and again in the early ’40s, and that time it gathers momentum. In 1944, a handful of non-dairy vegetarians get organised.

Donald Watson is probably the most well-known. He was the person who edited the magazine for the first two years.

This is Donald Watson, interviewed in 2002 at the age of 92 by the then Vegan Society chair George Rodger.

Donald Watson: “Year or two before the Society was formed, I was corresponding with a very small number of people scattered far and wide.”

Who are these people in terms of social class and background?

Reasonably well-educated people, but not people of great wealth or position in society. There’s certainly no one who’s titled, for example, as a patron or anything like that.

In fact if anything I suppose people like Donald Watson were anti-establishment. He was a conscientious objector which would have been pretty unusual at the time.

In April, at the Croydon Vegetarian Society, south London, Donald Watson proposes a motion against dairy products and only two or three people disagree. This debate probably brought together a lot of like-minded people, and it was organised and chaired by one Elsie Shrigley.

Elsie Shrigley taught piano at one point. Later on she marries a dentist and she helps in his surgery.

Elsie will stay on the organising committee until she dies in 1978.

Donald’s seconder, Fay, is a 40-something widow from a vegetarian family who manages the Attic Club. Seven weeks later, she marries a fellow activist, Allan Henderson.

Mr Henderson would later go on to be the first employee of the Society. He was a sort of a paid secretary.

The goal is to organise a section within the Vegetarian Society and its newsletter.

The Vegetarian Society refused them space in their journal. And had that request been accepted, they would have been a subgroup within the Vegetarian Society.

So one Sunday in November, the 5th says Elsie, core activists gather in Fay Henderson’s Attic Club.

I think there probably is a sense that the war is coming to its close, and that the end of the war is not that far away. So I suppose there must be beginnings of a mood of optimism I think.

But what to call themselves?

Watson: “I did appeal to my readers to suggest what the name might be. And I had a list of very bizarre suggestions.

The suggestion from the Hendersons was that the Society might be called All-Vega. And the magazine All-Vegan. And from that, Donald Watson created the name, vegan.

And I think that came from probably the restaurant that was owned by Walter Fleiss and his wife in central London at the time, which was called Veega.

You might remember the Fleisses from last show as socialist refugees from Nazi Germany.

Watson: “I settled for the word vegan, which was immediately accepted. And over the years, became part of our language.",1,1743311750.0,abasleciel,0,1.0,False

I'm a simple gal living in Southern California. I am a 40 years old jeans and hoodie kinda gal. Introverted, shy, clumsy, dorky, a lover of many things but a master of none, hopeless romantic, hugger, giggler, not totally fit but not a complete slob, love to travel and explore different places/food, and many other things. I believe in honesty, empathy, loyalty, and the simple things. I'm not a drinker, love coffee, and am a snack fiend. I love dogs but am allergic to cats. Heat is not my friend and I come alive in the colder months. Mosquitoes seek and destroy! I'm not big on social media and prefer to observe and enjoy things with my own eyes. Thus, there is no need to obsess over tiktok, snapchat, or whatever other crap people feel the need to obsessively like. However, I tend to go down random rabbit holes over random topics on YT. Tis a dream to find someone who can bring out the best in me and vice versa. Someone who can laugh over nonsense and enjoy simple things.

So... why is it so difficult to find the good ones? Starting to feel a bit out of place with my values in this day and age. Committed relationships, ideas of marriage, monogamy... since when is it a crime? I guess I am old fashioned

Yes, attraction is a factor because without it, where is the passion. Similarities in temperament, lifestyle, etc. all important, of course. But bloody hell... I am tired of the scammers, pervs, nonsense folks.

If anyone out there is looking for something real and can carry on more than one word replies, I am here. How lovely it would be to find folks who can enjoy the comfort of good, random chats.

Anyway...I wish you all a great day/evening!

I'd start at the crack of dawn, only to crash by noon. Guess it wasn't just my body that hated mornings...

After months of feeling like a zombie, I stumbled across the concept of *time blocking*—you know, scheduling specific tasks at set times. But here's where it gets juicy: I tweaked it with **energy peaks** and shaved off 10 hours from my workweek!

Curious? Here's how my journey unfolded:

- **Identify Your Energy Peaks**: Before diving into time blocking, ask yourself, ""When am I naturally most alert?"" Newsflash: It's not always in the morning, despite what caffeine commercials might have you believe! For me, it’s post-lunch. Who knew, right? 

- **Sketch the Non-Morning Schedule**: Using your newfound energy insights, block tasks when you’re at your peak. Mornings became my time for light activities—emails, planning, and (my fave) sipping endless coffee. Afternoons? I'm tackling big projects and brainstorming like a boss.

- **Chunk Tasks Based on Mood**: Sounds weird, but grouping tasks by vibe helped me flow smoother. Creative work with snacks for inspiration... check. Mundane admin with a good playlist... check. 

- **Buffer for the Unpredictable**: Allow *guilt-free* gaps for curveballs. Honestly, they’re sanity savers. Running late? Relax, the world won't combust.

**But does it always work perfectly?** Haha, as if! Life throws curveballs (hello, impromptu meetings). But, since tweaking my schedule around when my brain's at its prime, I actually feel *enthusiastic* about my to-do list. Go figure.

So here's my (not an actual) pro tip: listen to your brain. Next time you find yourself chugging coffee to ""power through,"" maybe swap it for a nap or a quick run. Who knows, skipping combat with mornings might just become your secret weapon, too.

Wonder if anyone else's brain is as rebellious against early starts as mine? 🤔",1,1743311116.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Classic Iced Coffee Recipe

Ingredients:

1 cup freshly brewed coffee (hot)

1 tsp sugar (optional, to taste)

Ice cubes

1/4 cup milk or cream (optional, for creaminess)

Flavored syrup or vanilla extract (optional)



---

Instructions:

1. Brew the Coffee:
Brew 1 cup of your favorite coffee. Use a French press, pour-over, or a moka pot for richer flavor.


2. Sweeten It (Optional):
While the coffee is still hot, stir in sugar or sweetener to taste so it dissolves completely.


3. Cool It Down:
Let the coffee sit at room temperature for a few minutes, or place it in the fridge to cool faster.


4. Pour Over Ice:
Fill a glass with ice cubes and pour the cooled coffee over it.


5. Add Milk or Cream (Optional):
Stir in milk, cream, or a dairy-free alternative for a creamy texture.


6. Customize (Optional):
Add a splash of vanilla extract or flavored syrup like caramel, hazelnut, or mocha.




---

Bonus Tip:
For a stronger flavor and less dilution, freeze leftover coffee in an ice tray and use coffee ice cubes instead of regular ones!

My elderly mother drives me crazy on a daily basis but today I feel like she took it to a new level. Every time I see this woman, I am drained for days.  I could really use some support and wondering if anyone else here has experienced this:

My mom asked me to meet her today at a coffee shop because she had important things to tell me.  She went on about how she’s in a horrible marriage (not the case, but she takes no accountability) and because her and my dad are planning to live separately soon but stay married as they are both elderly and don’t want to go through divorce, she said she wants to start dating so she can finally know what true love is.

Then, as we sat there, anytime a man would walk by, she would flirt with him and give him the eye. It was disturbing for so many reasons.  I felt myself go into a mental fetal position just trying to figure out how to feel and how to cope. She had no regard or care for how it affected me, she calls me her best friend and that she has to tell me these things, because if I am a good daughter, I will listen. She has been telling me disturbing things about her life and marriage since I was a kid.

And one general question, shall I be worried about the language? As I don't speak france at all? 

Any feedback, recommendation, or comment would be highly appreciated. ",1,1743309576.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,1.0,False

Orry.

It curled along his skin in deep red grooves, healed but angry, like it had been there for years. Each letter shimmered faintly in the sun, like something beneath his skin was trying to blink.

Across the street, a child was pulling teeth from a dandelion. Long human molars, still warm, blooming out of the yellow fluff like seeds. She didn’t seem upset—just bored. Every time she plucked one, a new one grew in its place. A man passed by her and casually tossed a penny into her lap, as if she were doing something normal. Like busking.

James blinked. His mouth was dry. The buildings were too tall. They leaned in. A bus rolled by, empty but loud, its wheels grinding like they were chewing.

“Hey,” said a voice behind him.

James turned. The man wore a milkman’s uniform—white, crisp, wrong for the decade—and no eyes. Just stitched lids with mascara leaking from the seams. He held out a small glass bottle filled with something thick and dark.

“It’s your turn,” the milkman said, shaking it. “You can’t keep skipping days.”

James took it without meaning to. His fingers were trembling. The bottle was warm.

From somewhere above them, a church bell rang, slow and wet. It sounded like meat slapping tile. Nobody else heard it.
James didn’t remember unscrewing the cap, but the bottle was open. The liquid inside moved like ink in reverse—pulling light into itself instead of reflecting it. It smelled like burnt rosemary and pencil lead.

“Bottoms up,” the milkman said. His stitched eyes twitched.

James tipped the bottle toward his lips but stopped when the sun blinked.

Not behind a cloud.

The sun itself blinked. Once. Slowly.

He dropped the bottle. It didn’t shatter. It breathed. A slow, glassy exhale as it melted into the sidewalk, leaving behind a ring of frost and a single eyelash.

The milkman was gone.

In his place stood a payphone with the receiver swinging. It rang once—just once—but the sound came from inside James’s chest. It rattled in his ribs.

He ran.

Down alleys that stretched too long. Past storefronts that all had the same display: A clock, bleeding from its numbers. The digits oozed down the glass like syrup, congealing into words he couldn’t read.

The ground was soft. Like bread. It gave slightly underfoot, like the whole city had been baked too long ago to still be fresh.

He stopped at a mirror nailed to a tree—because of course now there were trees—and looked into it.

The reflection wasn’t him.

It was a man with no mouth, wearing James’s clothes, holding a bouquet of snakes. They hissed in harmony, forming one word: Orry.

The trees began whispering names he almost remembered—lovers he’d never kissed, funerals he hadn’t attended. The ground cracked. The roots beneath pulsed like veins.

James stumbled backward and fell into a puddle that hadn’t been there before. The water was deep, bottomless. Falling felt like drowning, but wetter. Colder.
James landed on a carpet of static. Not a sound—actual static. The floor fuzzed and rippled under his palms like old television snow. He looked up and saw nothing but frames—hanging midair. Empty picture frames, all sizes, all spinning slowly.

Inside some of them, there were moments. Little clips. James as a child, sobbing in a field of headless dolls. James older, feeding something that looked like a goat but blinked horizontally. James asleep in a hospital bed, surrounded by people he didn’t recognize, all facing away from him.

In one frame, he was standing in front of a door. Rusted, pitted, too narrow to be real. It pulsed gently. Like it was breathing.

He looked away from the frame and the door was in front of him.

It hadn’t opened. But the key was in his hand. He hadn’t picked it up. It was made of glass, and a single vein ran through it—pulsing.

He knew what would happen if he opened it.
He knew what wouldn’t.

A voice—no, his voice—spoke behind him. “This is where you stopped before. Don’t pretend you forgot.”

James didn’t turn around.

He put the key in the lock.
The door smiled. Literally. Dozens of human teeth lined the edge like bristles. It groaned open.

Inside was not a room.

Inside was a chair. One single chair in a white void, and Orry was sitting in it.

Except… Orry was James. Or James was Orry. Or neither. The body wore his skin, but wrong—loose in some places, too tight in others. The face twitched between familiarity and distortion, like it couldn’t decide which version of him to be.

“You're early,” Orry-James said. “Or late. It's always hard to tell when the birds fall too fast.”

James opened his mouth to speak but instead screamed—not from his throat, but from his hands. His fingers parted, and his palm split open like a mouth, releasing a sound only dogs could understand.

The lights above them (where had the ceiling come from?) began to flicker Morse code in blood.

Orry stood. “Do you want to wake up now?”

James nodded.

Orry shook his head. “Then don’t open the door again.”
James’s eyes shot open.

He was in bed. Sheets damp with sweat. Fan whirring. The soft, choking hum of early morning light coming through the blinds. His heart was hammering, but the world was still.

No malformed birds. No melting bottles. No Orry.

Just… morning.

He stared at the ceiling, trying to shake the taste of static from his mouth. His alarm clock blinked red in the corner.

3:33 a.m.

He turned it away.

As he sat up, the corner of his blanket fell back—and he saw the name.

Faint. Faded. But there.

Orry. Etched on his forearm. Like old scar tissue that had been waiting to be noticed.

James stumbled to the bathroom. Splashed water on his face. Didn’t look up at the mirror at first. Didn’t want to.

But he did.

And the reflection was fine. Normal. Tired eyes. Dry lips. No bouquet of snakes.

Then the mirror blinked. Just once.

He didn’t.

The clock in the hall chimed from nowhere—once, twice, three times. The sound was wet. Like bones breaking under pressure.

He walked to the kitchen, needing light. Needing coffee. Needing anything real.

On the counter was a feather.

Not black. Not white. But the color of nothing—an absence. It shimmered like forgetting. It hadn’t been there last night. It shouldn’t have been there.

He picked it up.

Underneath it was a note, written in scorched handwriting:

“You were Orry before you woke up.
You’ll be him again soon.”

Behind him, a door creaked open.

His bedroom door.
Except he hadn’t opened it. And from the gap leaked light.
Not yellow. Not white.

Static.

Why do I always have to be the one to reach out, send messages, initiate contact. Why can it never be the other way around? I have a lot of friends, but nobody ever cares as much as I do. I just want someone who will see something on the internet and send it to me, look at something and send a photo thinking it reminds them of me. Ask me out to get coffee when they are bored, have nothing to do or are waiting and have to waste time. Be excited when they see me. Express that they enjoy my time. Why can't I just be remembered? 

I don't know what is worse. Being alone and lonely or having friends and lonely because nobody is the support and a friend that I need. It's not even about romantic partner, I don't even want that. I'm just tired of giving. I want to recieve some love and attention too. I want just one person to fill the void in my heart. I don't care who it is anymore.

He’s in his early 40s, married (no kids), and honestly, he’s the most captivating man I’ve ever met. I look forward to my opening shifts just to see him walk through the front door, coffee in hand, giving me that warm “good morning” that makes my heart skip a beat.

There’s the way he watches me when he thinks I’m not looking. I see him stealing glances, his gaze lingering just a little too long before he calls a patient from the waiting room. Sometimes, our eyes meet, and I get so flustered that I have to look away but not before I see that tiny, knowing smile on his lips.

I find myself looking for excuses to go into his room when he doesn’t have a patient, whether it’s asking him a question about one of his patients or bringing him a file that could’ve easily waited. And every time, he doesn’t just answer and send me on my way. He always finds a way to go off track, asking me about myself, my family, my plans for the weekend. The way he looks at me when I walk in, his gaze flickering up and down my body as I take a seat next to him, makes my skin tingle. It’s subtle, but it’s there, and it drives me insane.

It’s the little things that get to me, the way his face softens when we lock eyes, the effortless charm in his voice. He always finds a way to crack a joke or throw in some witty comment just to see me giggle, and when I do, he laughs too. It’s the loveliest sound in the world to me. I’d do anything just to hear it again.

He’s consuming my thoughts in ways I can’t even explain. I lie in bed at night, imagining the two of us together on a vacation. It's a beach resort, we are in the hotel room and there I am being a tease and trying on different bikinis for him just to seduce him. The dim lighting casting shadows on his perfect face as I straddle his lap, my fingers tangled in his hair, our breaths mingling in the quiet between kisses. 

I know it’s wrong. It will only ever be a fantasy—I would never act on it. But the feelings are there, and they won’t go away. I just needed to get this off my chest.",0,1743308360.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.5,False
