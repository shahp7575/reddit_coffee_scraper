The soft glow of the Brewing Stories sign felt like it was inviting me to slow down for a minute. The whole place was dim in that comforting way warm lights, dark tiles, wooden chairs, and the kind of seating that makes you want to sit a little longer than you planned.

I ordered a latte, sat down with my bag beside me, and just… breathed. No rush, no notifications, just the quiet hum of the café and the smell of fresh coffee. It felt like a little pocket of calm in the middle of the day, and it honestly made me wish we all had a place like this to disappear into when life feels too loud.",1,1764065705.0,cozy,0,1.0,False

The flavour is deeper, slower, and somehow more comforting than anything from a regular drip or capsule machine.

A lot of people ask where to find the *best coffee in the UAE* for phin brewing, but I’m starting to realise it’s not just about the beans, it’s the whole ritual. The slow drip, the aroma, the way the brew builds layer by layer. It’s almost meditative.

If anyone here is brewing with a [phin](https://thecaphevietnam.com/collections/phin-filter), what beans do you think pair best?

Robusta? Arabica? A mix? And do you prefer it hot or iced with condensed milk?

1p68t85,https://v.redd.it/ydxfv0ebod3g1,The Mirror Room,"# The Mirror Room

The studio closes at ten. Most nights, Lukas is the last to leave.  
Twenty-two, blond, all sharp cheekbones and long fighter’s legs, he lingers in the mirrored back room where the private lessons happen. The bags hang still. The lights are half-dimmed to save power. He likes the quiet; it lets him study himself from every angle, the way a photographer would.

He strips off his sweat-soaked shirt, drops his hand-wraps on the floor like shed skin, and stands in nothing but black compression shorts. The mirrors throw him back at himself a hundred times: lean, bruised, beautiful. He flexes. He turns. He imagines a lens instead of glass.

Then he hears the click of the lock.

The owner, Viktor, steps in. Forty-something, thick-necked, always in the same charcoal hoodie. He never says much, but tonight his eyes are different—steady, appraising, like he’s finally decided something.

“You keep coming back here alone,” Viktor says. Voice low, almost gentle. “Looking for something the ring won’t give you.”

Lukas’s pulse jumps, half fear, half recognition. He doesn’t answer. He doesn’t need to.

Viktor walks a slow circle around him. “Hands behind your back.”

It isn’t a request.

Lukas obeys before his brain catches up. The mirrors multiply the moment: one blond boy, wrists crossed at the small of his back, chest rising fast. Viktor produces a length of soft black rope from his pocket—nothing dramatic, just climbing cord, matte and discreet. He loops it twice, snug, not cruel. A cinch knot. Simple. Reversible. But the second the rope touches skin, Lukas feels himself drop into a different gear, like the world tilts five degrees and suddenly everything is sharper.

Viktor steps close enough that Lukas can smell coffee and chalk on him. “Color?” he asks. Just one word. Safe, practiced.

“Green,” Lukas whispers. His voice cracks like a teenager’s.

Viktor smiles, small and private. He doesn’t kiss him. Doesn’t need to. He just rests one heavy hand between Lukas’s shoulder blades and pushes—slow, inexorable—until the boy’s chest meets the cold mirror. Breath fogs the glass. Nipples harden instantly. Lukas watches his own wide blue eyes in the reflection, pupils blown.

“Stay,” Viktor says.

He leaves him there. Ten seconds. Thirty. A full minute. Long enough for Lukas’s arms to start aching, for the rope to bite just enough, for humiliation and lust to braid together so tight he can’t tell which is which.

When Viktor returns he’s carrying a single leather cuff—padded, discreet, the kind that could pass for kickboxing gear if anyone ever saw it. He fastens it around Lukas’s left ankle, clips a short tether to a floor bolt nobody ever notices. Then he steps back.

“Count to twenty,” he says. “Out loud. If you move your foot, we start over.”

Lukas’s forehead is still pressed to the mirror. His reflection stares back, flushed and trembling.

“One,” he begins, voice shaking.

By twelve he’s hard against the glass. By twenty he’s begging without words, just breath and little broken noises that echo in the empty room.

Viktor unhooks the tether, uncoils the rope, folds it neatly, and puts it away. No aftercare yet—just a hand on the back of Lukas’s neck, grounding.

“Shower,” he says. “Then come find me when you’re ready for the next round.”

Lukas nods, throat too tight for thanks.

He watches Viktor leave. The door closes. The lock clicks again.

In the hundred mirrors, a blond boy stands alone, red marks circling his wrists like bracelets, lips parted, eyes dark with a hunger that finally has a name.

He smiles at every single reflection.

This is only the first night.  
The studio has many rooms.  
And Viktor has many keys.",1,1764065505.0,cartoonhunks,0,1.0,False

1p68p3l,https://i.redd.it/8r35nzb4nd3g1.jpeg,WhatsApp & Amazon Targeted Ads - UK,"So, Amazon sent me a text via WhatsApp recently. That’s annoying enough, as I never received ads before via WhatsApp, only personal text messages.

But here’s where it gets a bit more questionable:


This weekend past, my partner and I were shopping. As we moved around the shop we spotted a blue Le Creuset cooking pot, and talked about how much we liked it. Same with a DeLonghi coffee machine… *neither of which I googled before being in that shop* as I had never seen these items before, and haven't had thought about since.

Then suddenly I’m receiving targeted ads with blue Le Creuset pots and deals of DeLonghi Coffee machines all highlighted against my favourite shade of orange.

I can think of no reason I would receive such a targeted Ad unless somehow WhatsApp or Amazon are working together and listening to our conversations and transcribing it.

To be on the safe side, and for privacy, I have begun to revoke microphone Access to WhatsApp and any other meta product.

Does anyone else have a more knowledgeable explanation for why this is so targeted?",1,1764065060.0,whatsapp,0,1.0,False

IT GETS BETTER!,"I started Sertraline about 4,5 months ago due to depression and anxiety. It worked wonders for the anxiety but took longer to work for the depression. When it worked, I was emotionally blunt (as many other patients can relate) and my will to do things, motivation to go to work or want anything in life was still gone.

Then my doctor introduced Bupropion 150mg XL to my meds.

* WEEK 1: Ok, just very thirsty and sleeping terrible, agitated during the night (no honeymoon phase for me)
* WEEK 2: Couldn't drink coffee for 2 or 3 days or I would get very anxious, jittery, feeling horrible. Then later I could drink max 1 cup a day
* WEEK 3: Still crappy sleep, still taking it easy on the coffee/stimulants so I don't get anxiety
* WEEK 4-5: Getting better with sleep and anxiety, but still not fullfilling the purpose of giving me more energy and motivation. Doctor considered increasing to 300mg XL but I was soooo afraid that my anxiety will come back and the sertraline wouln't be able to contain it. I chose not to increase the dose and give it more time.
* WEEK 6-8 (now): The past 3 weeks I have been feeling great EVERY SINGLE DAY, and that hasn't happened in at least 3 years. Sleep is normal, the dread of every morning is over, and most importantly: I feel life has meaning again! I can go to work again without feeling hopeless and have the energy to work on my passions and hobbies too.

It gets better! Unless you can't really cope with the anxiety or other side effects... just hang in there until it really starts working.

1p68mor,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuntaCana/comments/1p68mor/melia_punta_cana_wellness_my_experience/,Melia Punta Cana Wellness - My experience,"Spent 11 nights 7-18 Nov in the Melia Punta Cana wellness resort and heres my take:

Firstly background so you know where Im coming from. Were a couple 56 and 58, down to earth happy to swim in english beaches, shop in primark but also Boss/Ralph. Eat KFC, Doner kebabs but also like fine dining, Like a diet coke but also a Malbec, neither smoke.

The resort itself is beautiful, clean and if you are looking to relax it is perfect. The complex is large but there are buggies (carry 10-12) going up and down from beach and rooms to reception constantly and is not 15mins as reported by some. Just chill and wait or take a lovely walk - 10 mins. 

Rooms are clean and roomy and free minibar topped up daily from what you use (water/coke/beer/nuts/cereal bar). AC is a dream and fan is good, but switching orientation means fan on light on, bathroom light on, side light on. We had fan off, AC off which meant lights off at night and was comfortable.

Beach - yes there was still some sargassum but toward end of stay it was all but gone. The hotels do all they can to clear this and there are sea breaks to try and stop it but it is an ecological issue so accept it and just keep from view if your a slave to instagram and want to show off clear beaches. Sea had a nice tide to it which we liked but its not turquoise so again accept and be imaginitive with pics. Along the Bavaro beach there are some public beaches which maybe arent scraped as often as private beaches, so if not to your liking stay on the private beaches

Food - We will eat most things, so breakfast buffet was delicious and a wide range from your bacon and eggs, fruit, cereals, juices (kale/beets etc), fresh bread, pastries, cold meats. There are a few cooking stations for omelettes, poached or fried eggs etc - there will be something for everyone. Lunch is also at beach buffet and a good range again. afternoon snacks  similar to lunch cooked to order burgers. Evening buffet is up at reception and has themed nights, international/mexican/mediterranean. All nights are similar with cooking stations offering different options. Reports of bland food is harsh but ok yes after 10 nights do you want the same again and again possibly not so use the other options. You can book a mediterranean restaurant (no different to buffet imo but was nice to get away to less hectic surroundings and be served. Vietnamese restaurant was delicious. We also ventured along beach to Jellyfish restaurant. Obviously had to pay here and yes a little pricey but well worth it as location and food was excellent. If you dont like buffets, don t like carveries, then maybe you should look elsewhere or accept youre eating out with the added expense

Entertainment - up at reception there is bits going on in evening which are all noted on the resort app, Michael Jackson tribute, local dancing, clarinet player (good) DJ music. We tended to watch the 9.30pm stuff and head back to room. We heard younger groups who went to a place just outside resort with free limo so there is options for the livelier to party, but cant comment as didnt go.

Pool is right on the beach and beautifully surrounded by palm trees, and the staff are out every morning cleaning the pools, but omg accept that the trees will drop leaves etc and the beach being so close will drift sand. Now there are rules on towel saving of beds round pool but is it enforced not really, only but a couple of guests who threw others who hadnt been there all day off the beds. Suggest you get up around 7pm but your towel out, have a nice walk on beach and come back to pool bed. By all means leave them for breakfast lunch etc but dont reserve if going excursion all day

Excursion - only went on a local sight seeing half day as didnt want 3 hr drive there and 3 hr back to visit capital. It was ok i suppose and included a horse ride, a church visit, a local market (police escort) souvenier shop. cigar making factory and a good beach (short dip visit) Like I say, it was ok. One of the top excursions is Saona beach, which again you spend a lot of time driving. Didnt go and didnt hear anyone we chatted to say it was worth it - its a beach !

Hmmm for debate - Level!! We looked at it and were offered it discounted half way in to visit as rooms became available. We took opportunity to look around roof top bar etc 

You get private pool - so what most go to main pool with swim up bar

You get mattress on your sunbed - again so what

You get an area of the beach to yourself and maybe a cabana but everyone still swims in same sea, and hotel beach is same whether Level or not

Concierge - I get these can help some people book trips/massages/restaurants, but the hotel make this easy so not sure how much worth someone helping you all hoiliday is worth it - heard they were stopping this service.

Food - Level guests often seen in main buffet. Yes they have their own restaurant so thats nice but the food was not really any different - chicken is chicken, shrimp is shrimp. 

Drink - Yes you do get to drink branded drinks. If this is important to you this is the one real advantage of Level.

Location in my opinion is not as good as main rooms which are closer to main pool and beach and same distance away from reception. Rooms are a little roomier but not required 

Rooftop bar did look good, with great views of sea and pool and has live music just as does main reception bar, but most came up to main entertainment to increased atmosphere

Had a massage which was truly fantastic (had many in my time) - sound healing was so good I fell asleep and upset my good lady by snoring in front of all other sound healing guests that afternoon - it was so relaxing.

Saw TUI rep at sister (kids) hotel and added her whatsapp which she answered with my random questions so worth getting if you can.

MOST IMPORTANT! ............. Tip. Just 100 Peso (RSD) when you get a drink or waitress brings you drinks or at swim up bar take some tips occasionall. Leave maid a tip as towels and toilet rolls will be replenished more. If you use mini bar leave a 100 peso as it will get restocked with more than previous and even got a chocolate bar. I cant stress how important it is to tip at bar - you will get served quicker, and I swear the alcohol content increases if you talk to them and tip

REMEMBER! .... its Caribbean, the waiters etc move slower, they dont rush around, if you ask for wine with dinner which they always ask, or coffee in morning with breakfast, it might come halfway through..... so just keep eye out for waiters and keep reminding them .... chill .... oh and leave tip as they will be faster the next day lol

Overall I liked the place, and the food, entertainment, staff, drinks but we are an easy going couple who can slum it as well as live it up so any questions Im happy to respond - I will edit should I remember anything else to advise

1p68k3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p68k3m/aita_for_feeling_uncomfortable_that_my_husband/,AITA for feeling uncomfortable that my husband wants to meet another woman for coffee after he cheated on me during my pregancy?,"Okay, so me (27F) and my husband (26M) have been married for 4 years. It’s been an easy, happy relationship overall — good intimacy, we’re both really affectionate, no major issues. At least not until I got pregnant.

If you’ve been pregnant or know someone who has, you know the first trimester is brutal. I was exhausted, nauseous, and honestly just wanted to be left alone most of the time. Even then, we still spent time together when I was feeling okay.

Anyway, around this time I started noticing my husband becoming distant. He guarded his phone, slammed his laptop shut when I walked into the room — basically all the classic signs of cheating or hiding something. He works night shifts sometimes, and one day while he was sleeping after a shift, I logged into his laptop. (He used to let me use it, and I guess he forgot I still knew the password.)

I checked his Facebook and Instagram and found MULTIPLE conversations with different women. Most of the time he was trying to steer the chats into something sexual, but they didn’t really go along with it. He also tried to set up meetups, but nothing ever seemed to actually happen. I also saw notifications on his phone from Tinder, Grindr, and Snapchat — things I didn’t even know he had accounts on. I didn’t have access to his phone, so I couldn’t check those, but I assume it was more of the same.

When he woke up, after I spent hours spiraling, I confronted him. Long story short, he said he only did it out of boredom and insecurity (which he *does* struggle with and we’ve talked about before), and that none of it was ever physical. He was genuinely apologetic and didn’t try to blame me at all. I wasn’t sure I fully believed him, but I chose to forgive him and try rebuilding trust.

I didn’t set rules like demanding access to his phone, because I felt like that would just turn me into a prison warden. I didn’t want our relationship to become that. But I still couldn’t shake the feeling that he might fall back into old habits.

Recently I was feeling insecure again and opened his laptop to check if he’d messaged anyone. And of course, he had — this time just one woman. She’s someone he already knows, and the messages were friendly. He even mentioned me and our baby. But *he* started the conversation and asked her to meet for coffee.

I’m not against him talking to other women or even meeting someone for coffee. What bothers me is that it’s so out of character for him. He’s normally a total homebody who doesn’t like making new friends, meeting new people, or staying out long. Even with me, he prefers to be home. But suddenly he has the energy to meet up with other women?

So my question is: Should I bring this up? I feel like I’m becoming exactly what I didn’t want to be — someone spying on his messages and constantly questioning him. What do I do? How do I even ask him about this?",0,1764064537.0,AITAH,13,0.5,False

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a basketball spectacle where the underdog is about as likely to win as a vegan at a barbecue contest. The UNLV Rebels (3-3) will face the No. 8 Alabama Crimson Tide (3-2) on November 26, 2025, in a matchup that bookmakers have about as close to a sure thing as a churro in a cholesterol support group. Let’s break this down with the precision of a caffeinated statistician and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s seen too many March Meltdowns.

### Parse the Odds: Why Alabama’s Implied Probability is Basically a Foregone Conclusion

The odds for this game scream “mismatch” louder than a toddler in a fireworks factory. DraftKings lists Alabama at **1.06 decimal odds** (+106 in American), implying a **94% chance of victory**. UNLV, meanwhile, sits at **9.6**, translating to a **9.4% chance**—about the same odds as me correctly predicting the outcome of a roulette wheel while blindfolded and texting.

The spread? Alabama is favored by **13.5 points**, a line so steep it makes a skyscraper look humble. The total is set at **181.5 points**, suggesting this could be a high-scoring affair… unless UNLV’s offense decides to take a permanent vacation. For context, UNLV shot **36.7%** in their last game against Maryland, which is about as effective as a sieve made of Swiss cheese.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Struggles, and Why Alabama’s Coffee is Always Stronger

**UNLV Rebels**: Fresh off a **74-67 loss to Maryland**, the Rebels looked like a rusty sprinkler trying to hydrate a desert. Their lead evaporated during a **14-4 Maryland run** fueled by Andre Mills and Myles Rice, who combined for layups and threes like they were auditioning for a dunk contest. Dravyn Gibbs-Lawhorn dropped 17 points, but Kimani Hamilton (11 points) fouled out, proving th

1p68e0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1p68e0a/a_guide_to_obtaining_lucky_rings_and_other/,A Guide To Obtaining Lucky Rings (and other pan-able items),"Just some quick notes before I start: this guide is mainly based on my own in-game situation - I'm in year 5 with 90% perfection, mostly just waiting for my wine set-up to produce enough gold to get the Golden Clock. And so my in-game routine is primarily completing some repeated chores (animals, fish ponds, etc) by around 10am, and then having the rest of the day free for whatever (such as ring-hunting).  
  
There are almost certainly better ways to go about this, but this is the set-up that finally got me a Lucky Ring so it should be good enough; I'm mainly writing this since the info that comes up when you search for a Lucky Ring guide tends is pretty scarce, and isn't very detailed. The only ""in-depth"" guide I found on Reddit used a save game viewer for predicting the random drops in crates, which I can't use as an Xbox player. I won't go into the exact numbers for this, but they can be pretty easily found on the amazing Stardew Valley Wiki.

1. Panning for a Lucky Ring is significantly quicker than farming the Skull Cavern/Quarry Mine for it. Unless you haven't done some basic Skull Cavern runs yet, there isn't much of a point going for the ring via the Skull Cavern (and especially not the Quarry Mine), since the odds are really low. I personally was also aiming to get the Lucky Ring so that I could better farm for auto-petters, so I wanted to save my Skull Cavern resources (bombs and staircases) for those runs.

2. The chance for Lucky Rings to drop is, funnily enough, heavily dependent on in-game luck, and so everything should be done to maximise it. Lucky Ring ""farming runs"" (described below) should only really be done when on full daily luck. >!Complete secret note #20 to obtain the Special Charm!<, and eat a Lucky Lunch and/or drink a Ginger Ale before your first panning spot to maximise your chances.

3. Fully upgrade your pan. An iridium pan with the ""Generous"" enchantment significantly increases the amount of ""rolls"" for items per panning spot, which means a much higher chance for the Lucky Ring per panning spot.

4. For how much the Tracker profession seems to be disliked by the community (I will admit it is pretty useless for its ""advertised"" use-case), it's actually really useful for finding panning spots. Tracker allows you to pretty much instantly tell if panning spot is anywhere in the current region of the map, which significantly cuts down on time spent running around looking for them. Panning spots also show up with a different coloured arrow (green) compared to the other forageables' arrows (yellow). If you've already chosen your foraging professions, >!you can change them to Gatherer & Tracker at the Shrine of Uncertainty in the Sewers for 10k gold, and change them back later once you're done for another 10k.!<

  
Now for the actual ""technique"" of this guide. Only one panning spot can be spawned in each region of the map at any time (afaik - I haven't ever seen more than one at the same time), so our goal is to maximise the amount of regions with panning locations (rivers, beaches, lakes, etc) we can visit in a given amount of time. When you load into a region of the map, you should:  
1. Open your inventory to pause the game.  
2. Scan the borders of your screen for green arrows. These indicate off-screen panning spots.  
3. Scan any visible & accessible water for the gold shimmering effect. This is a viable panning spot.  
4. Unpause and move to the panning spot (if there is one).

Once you've gotten your panning spot, go ahead and pan it! (Don't forget your luck buffs for the first panning spot of the day.) Another panning spot can sometimes spawn in the same region right after you're done panning, so you may want to pause & scan again just in case. Once/if there are no panning spots, move along to the next region in the route (see below).

My route relies pretty heavily on a lot of mid to end-game stuff >!including the Desert, Island, and Mountain Obelisks, the Ginger Island Parrot Express, the Return Scepter, and Robin's town shortcuts !<. You may have to remove or modify it to suite your current capabilities, and if a panning spot takes you too far away from the usual ""entrance"" of the region, you should of course take a closer entrance if one is available. You can also repeat the route after you're done, and a Coffee/Triple Shot Espresso and/or your horse is really useful for doing this quickly. Here's my route:  
>!1. Teleport to Calico Desert (scan the pond outside the Skull Cavern enterance).!<  
>!2. Teleport home and then teleport to Ginger Island (scan the southern beach).!<  
>!3. Move to the Ginger Island farm (scan the western beach and river). You can also do any Ginger Island farm chores whilst you're there.!<  
>!4. Use the Parrot Express to go to the dig site (scan the dig site river).!<  
>!5. Teleport home and then teleport to the mountain (scan the mountain lake).!<  
>!6. Take the shortcut past the quarry bridge down to the eastern side of town (scan the town river).!<  
>!7. Take the shortcut on the eastern side of town down to the beach (scan the beach).!<  
>!8. Take the beach shortcut through to Cindersap Forest (scan the forest river and lake).!<

\*\* STRONG THEMES, READER DISCRETION ADVISED\*\*

**Part 1**

I lived a normal life, at least I did. I had a boring job in a boring town. A normal office job. It wasn’t particularly difficult or important. I was twenty-one at the time, living at home with my dad. I would help my grandmother as much as I could because she was old, had trouble getting around, and had recently lost my grandfather.

On this particular day she was sick and had me go to the store to pick up groceries—bread, ginger ale, and some medicine among other things. As the sun set, I hopped in my old Ford Bronco and went to the local Sav-A-Lot, less than a block away. It was in a small shopping center across from the mall. It had seen better days—business in the area had dried up and moved elsewhere. As a result, the average quality customers had come to expect had gone down, giving way to a new demographic of patrons.

I got my shopping cart and worked down the list my grandmother had made for me. Walking down the aisles, I’d spot something I need, tap it off the shelf, watch it fall into my cart, and then move on to the next item. See the next item, toss it in the cart and move down the list until I had everything crossed off.

Ready to check out, I move to the checkout lane and see a pretty girl. She was short with hazel eyes and pin-straight black hair. I gave her a smile, and she smiled back at me revealing small dimples indented on her cheeks. I had a girlfriend at the time, but it’s not like she was there. We had a nice, albeit brief, conversation outside the normal customer service chatter. Whether she liked me or was just doing her job, I couldn’t tell.

I dropped the shopping cart off in the corral and carried the bags of groceries out to my car. The brisk night air welcomed me as the sliding doors opened up. Only a few cars were present in the parking lot. The sun had passed the horizon, revealing a half moon and stars spread across the night sky. The darkness was illuminated by the many shoebox lights scattered across the parking lot. Walking to my car, I began to see a shadow in front of me, and then another, and then another. I heard the shuffling of feet behind me, then someone shouting.

“Hey, you”

Turning around, I see three men in front of me. They looked unkempt with stains and spots speckled across their clothing. There were two overweight guys with one thin short man in the middle of them.

“What?” I questioned.

The shortest one in the group spoke, “Gimme your groceries and your money.”

“What? No,” I said.

The short one, seemingly the leader of the group, spoke again, “No, you motherfucker, I want your groceries and your money, and I want it now.”

“No,” I said, “You can’t have them.”

“Look man, you don’t have to make this hard. We got laid off, our families gotta eat. I need that food for myself and I need that money for my bills and you’re gonna give ‘em to me.”

“You can come get them you dirty motherfucker.”

I was feeling cocky—so arrogant. I felt at the very least I could get out with my wallet and maybe a few groceries if I was lucky. The leader was a small guy, but the other two were almost double my size. Looking back, fighting was delusional given my lanky build and being outnumbered three to one, but it didn’t stop me.

The two bigger guys move in to either side of me forming a flank.

The one on the right of me spoke up, “Maaan, you better give me that money. You better stop fucking around. You ain’t making this easy for yourself.”

“Well, why don’t you get a fucking job instead of stealing from me.”

We both continued yelling back and forth, neither one of us wanting to give in until I finally came to a decision of what I’d do. I extended out my arms, offering my groceries.

“Here.”

The two bigger guys moved in to come and take them.

 I took a step back, swung my arms back and flung the groceries as hard as I could at each of the two bigger guys, catching them off guard. Maybe not my best plan, but it was all I could come up with in the moment. The short one started to charge at me. I threw a punch with my right and then my left. The right fist connects, hitting him square in nose, but the left one misses. He stood firm and shoved me back a couple feet. I found my footing and went to land another blow, but one of his friends grabbed me by my shirt and flung me into a parked car.

My vision began to shudder as I hit my head. With my back against the car, I again attempt to get up and fight. One of them struck me on the back of my head and I started to lose my balance. I stumbled, tripped, and fell face first on the ground. Everything went black for a moment. A punch to my jaw jolted me awake and it was followed up with several kicks to the ribs. I curled up in a ball as all three of them were kicking every exposed part of my body. The next thing I knew, they were holding me up against the car, supporting my whole weight as I was no longer able to stand. The punch to my face had cut open my lip. I could taste the metallic taste of blood as it ran down my mouth. I saw the leader’s lips moving, but I couldn’t hear anything he was saying. After a few seconds, the world around me slowly became audible.

His words became intelligible as he continued to speak, “… Now look at my nose. Look what you did to my fucking nose.” He cupped his hand around his nose and then stuck it out to me revealing smeared blood on his palm.

“All you had to do was give us what we asked for. We could’ve been done by now, you could’ve gone home.”

I heard a distinct *‘click’* and saw a glint of light.  It was a knife.  I couldn’t move; I couldn’t run. All I could do was lie there helplessly on the side of the car as he drove the knife into the left side of my chest, aiming for my heart. I felt a sharp pain, but it felt more like a wet punch.

I collapsed onto the ground, blood spilling out unimpeded while my eyelids began to feel heavy. They ran away and left me to bleed out. The world turned fuzzy as the warm blood exited my body. I felt cold but surprisingly calm. I struggled to keep my eyelids open.

I heard someone in the parking lot calling for help. The sight of me made her scream out but unbeknownst to me there was another set of eyes, a more important set of eyes—watching, calculating, wondering why and planning many things on my behalf.

**Part 2**

I woke up in a panic at the hospital. I didn’t know where I was. My face was throbbing and covered in gauze. Pain radiated throughout my entire body. I could feel a catheter pushing against my bladder, feeling as though it was ready to burst. When I came to, I was in a semi-conscious state which was no doubt worsened by the drugs they had given me. I attempted to remove the IV from my arm before I was stopped by a nurse.

“Oh no, don’t move. You’re at the hospital. You’ve sustained serious injuries. Just lie back down.”

I continued to panic before losing consciousness again, falling back onto the firm hospital bed.

The recovery was long and painful. I had cracked my teeth and had to get replacements. My cheekbone was fractured. I had multiple stab wounds and sustained serious brain damage. Luckily, the blade missed my heart. I should’ve been dead. I should’ve bled to death on the pavement, but I was alive.

I was in the hospital for a few weeks before they discharged me and sent me to physical therapy. When I left, the whole world felt different to me. I went from self-confident, cocky and arrogant to shy, timid and meek. When I would get on the bus, I did my best not to brush anyone’s shoulder. When someone disagrees with me, I decide not to argue for fear it might escalate.

I’m afraid. Afraid of getting hurt again.

At home I’m different. I’m controlling and aggressive, but when it leads into confrontation, I can’t handle it—I lock up. When someone shouts at me, I cry and cower. I knew it was driving my family crazy, but I couldn’t help it.

My girlfriend was getting tired of me too. For months I had put on a fake front, acting tough and shouting at her, until one day she had enough and slapped me across my face. I laid there in a ball whimpering like a little girl.

“You need to get your life together,” she said. “It’s not fair. I can’t live like this.”

It was the final push I needed. She was right. I couldn’t carry on the way I was. There was something wrong with me. My wounds may have healed some, but my mind hadn’t. There was some kind of flaw in my brain, a vestige from the trauma I’d endured. So, the next logical step was therapy.

We talked about the trauma I had experienced both physical and psychological. The therapist had explained why I had been acting the way I was and told me that it wasn’t uncommon given my circumstance. Therapy worked to a point. I started to build back my confidence brick by brick, but it was far below what it used to be. The frequency of my episodes had decreased, but after a while I stopped seeing progress, so my therapist recommended a new approach.

“We can only do so much,” she said. “You need to go out and meet people to start building healthier relationships. I’m recommending you go to outpatient group therapy.”

She handed me the number to a family crisis center. It was a bit of an unusual recommendation. Crisis centers are generally meant for families experiencing things like domestic violence, sexual assault, and other forms of abuse, but she reassured me it was where I needed to be.

The building sat alone at the edge of town. They had tea, coffee, stale cookies and cheap metal foldout chairs. If you got there early you could get one of the nicer ones with a cushion on it. I got to hear a lot of stories. Some of them had confrontation issues like me, but for various other reasons. Some were doing better than I was, others worse.

The group therapy seemed to be working. I started to see more progress, and my family was thankful for it. I even made a new friend. His name was John.

John wasn’t dealing with the kind of abuse most of them were dealing with. He had an overbearing family that had been that way since the day he was born. His family controlled every aspect of his life, even into adulthood, and his girlfriend was no better. She would decide who he could and couldn’t see. She would get jealous when he’d simply hold a conversation with a woman or even look in the direction of one for too long. He’d always obey whatever request they asked of him no matter how ridiculous it was. He had a lot of pent-up anger and frustration that had been building up since childhood.

John and I became fast friends. He had a similar build to mine; tall, lanky, but with blond hair and grey eyes and he was a couple of inches shorter than I was. Having a friend there made the days easier for me.

Things were going well enough, until I noticed someone in the room. Someone that seemed off. Something about the way he spoke, the way he carried himself. That same confidence that we longed for, he seemed to have in excess. The stories he would tell didn’t seem quite right, they didn’t make sense. When he was talking about himself, it was as if he was talking about someone completely different. Whoever this guy was, he didn’t belong here.",1,1764063556.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I finally get to share something I’ve been quietly building for a while. It’s called **Button Builder**, and it lets you design **custom-button-card** buttons through a clean visual interface instead of wrestling with YAML.

You control everything: colors, icons, tap/hold actions, animations, conditional states, shadows, borders, gradients, you name it. When you're done, Button Builder spits out the YAML so you can paste it straight into your dashboard. No guesswork, no fighting indentation at 2 a.m.

It also has an **AI mode** where you can type something like, “Make a glowing red garage button that turns green when closed,” and it will try to create the YAML for you. Sometimes it’s perfect, sometimes it’s a chaos gremlin, but it’s fun either way.

A few honest notes:

• It’s early. Things will break.  
• I’ve never coded before in my life. I built this entire thing by working with AI tools.  
• It’s available through HACS by adding it as a custom repo.  
• GitHub repo: [**https://github.com/aspenrt78/button-builder/**](https://github.com/aspenrt78/button-builder/)  
• Supporting it costs me both time and real money (AI tokens add up fast), so if you enjoy the project and want to help keep it going, my Buy Me a Coffee is open. No pressure.

Right now I need testers and community feedback. If you know dashboards, I’d love your ideas. If you’re new to Home Assistant, I’d love to see what you create. Bug reports, tips, tricks, suggestions, and contributions are all appreciated.

If you want to try something new, make cleaner dashboards, or just enjoy pressing shiny buttons, give Button Builder a shot and let me know what you think.

Happy automating!

**Answer:**

Hey, I totally understand the uncertainty and worry that comes with a reaction like that. It's great that you took action and got yourself to a safe place. Sometimes, our bodies can react to the unresolved stress or conflicts that we aren't fully aware of. This might sound a bit out there, but sometimes when our psyche is trying to protect us, it can manifest as physical symptoms.

In your case, with the recent development of allergies, it could be worth looking into any new stresses or changes in your life that might be contributing. Our bodies can react to emotional pressures in surprising ways.

Consider reflecting on these questions:

1. Have you experienced any major changes or stresses in your life recently?

2. How do you feel about the foods you've been having reactions to? Is there any emotional connection?

3. Do you notice any patterns with your symptoms and when they occur?

4. Are there situations where you feel restricted or unable to express yourself fully?

5. Has there been something specific you're trying to avoid or distance yourself from?

You ever wake up and instantly feel like the day already has its own plan for how it would play out? That was me this morning. Nothing bad had happened, i just felt very low on energy and zest. 

I made coffee and it tasted quite off, my Spotify kept shuffling between songs I rather would have preferred didn't play, and the weather was not left out, as it couldn't decide between sunny or cloudy. 

I was walking to work when I  passed by two people riding what appeared to be Super73 electric bikes or models similar. They were just zooming off so comfortably and it made me start to think about the way things are in life, where it could be so cheery for someone and gloomy for someone else.

At the office, one of my colleagues was searching Alibaba over lunch and was going through random gadgets, I found a few items that I have mentally made notes to get, one being a portable neck massager. It became a little diversion of the entire morning I had. We began to compare items we were not yet ready to buy.

Everything did later calm down towards evening. The sky was better and chill and even the music felt right again.",1,1764062963.0,venting,2,1.0,False

Leora sat with both elbows on the console, a cup of something that had once been coffee cooling at her side. The cube from Distant Field’s captain flickered in a corner of the holo, replaying the Maggot Throne from different angles, but she’d muted the sound.

She didn’t need to hear it again.

“Annette’s feed is live,” the tech at the back said. “Null channel confirmed, tight-beam handshake complete.”

“Put her on,” Leora said.

The holo split.

On one side: Valdemar’s internal model of Asterion—wireframe ring, projected stabilizer load, pirate contact estimates. On the other: a grainier but denser map from Veil-of-Glass, with overlaid harmonic fields pulsing in strange colours only the Choir seemed to like.

Annette herself appeared only as a small window: sharp features, hair tied back, a faint smudge of fatigue under her eyes.

“Leora,” she said. “I see you found one of my ghosts.”

“You threw him at us,” Leora said. “You don’t get to act surprised.”

“Spirits of correlation, not causation,” Annette said dryly. “Orth’s throat was messy. He could’ve come out anywhere. But I’m glad it was you.”

Leora pointed at the shared model.

“Let’s skip the pleasantries,” she said. “We’re about to chew on the same bone.”

She keyed a command.

The two maps—Valdemar’s and Veil-of-Glass’s—merged. Asterion’s ring grew more detailed, cross-bracing and maintenance shafts snapping into place, harmonic fields draped over them like a second skin.

“Choir harmonics from your last week of listening,” Leora said, highlighting one layer. “Karr’s engineer’s readings from his personal cube.” She highlighted another. “Our own scout data from the Orth side.”

The three waves folded into one.

There were differences in resolution and noise, but the pattern was clear: the ring was not in freefall. It was being held.

“Whoever’s on that stabilizer core knows enough not to break it,” Leora said. “Bring a hammer down blind and you either knock them loose or crack the artery. We can’t accept those odds.”

“Crack the artery,” Annette repeated. “You’re already talking like Lars.”

“There are worse habits,” Leora said. “Watch this.”

She dialed the time scale back.

The harmonics played out over days.

“You see that?” she asked.

Small spikes, irregular, darted across the wave: moments where throughput surged for a block of time and then dropped to a low simmer.

“Windowed pushes,” Annette said. “They’re timing when they move which ships.”

“Exactly,” Leora said. “They’re not just taking random targets when they can manage it. They’re creating… tides. Big pushes for high-value traffic, stutters for low-value, dead calm for prey.”

She overlaid ship logs from Distant Field’s cube: time stamps, dock slots, pirate announcements.

“They timed Karr’s public display with one of the high-flow windows,” Leora said. “Maximum audience. Maximum fear.”

Annette’s mouth thinned.

“Karr Veyl understands optics,” she said. “Of course he does. He’s broadcasting as much to Freehold and Cindral as to anyone on the deck.”

“And they’re still treating this as noise and ‘elevated risk’,” Leora said. “We both know it isn’t.”

Annette flicked a glance aside, reading something off-frame.

“Freehold just downgraded Orth–Halcyon again,” she said. “Higher premiums. No coverage freeze. Cindral replied to their first inquiry with a polite version of ‘not our jurisdiction yet.’ Concordant has put ‘discussion of Orth–Halcyon security’ on their Assembly docket for three days from now.”

“Three days just to talk,” Leora said. “Then votes. Then orders. Then jumps.”

She highlighted Valdemar’s icon relative to Asterion and, further out, the closest Concordant and Cindral fleet groups.

“From where we are,” she said, “one jump to Orth, one to Asterion. From where they are… three, four jumps and a mountain of paperwork.”

Annette leaned forward slightly.

“Give me numbers,” she said.

Leora obliged.

“Assume we get immediate slot priority at Orth,” she said. “We can drop into Asterion’s well in forty to fifty hours. Add a margin for adjustments and any flux tantrums; call it seventy-two for full fleet positioning and initial scans.”

“Concordant heavy element?” Annette asked.

“Minimum twenty days,” Leora said. “More if their Assembly stalls or some admiral worries about breaking doctrine. Cindral: same. Aniconate: unknown, but they’ve already issued a proclamation about ritual condemnations, so they’ll stall on purpose.”

Annette’s fingers moved off-screen.

“Choir agrees,” she said. “No significant gravity waves from massing heavy hulls in the right sectors. No spike in military-band noise near the Orth cluster from anyone but you.”

Leora highlighted Valdemar’s icon.

“And Anton,” she said. “Steelbridge is a jump behind us. Iron Line will follow.”

“So,” Annette said. “Within the next three days, anyone who does anything meaningful to Asterion will be… Hjertstedt.”

“Or the Crown,” Leora said. “If we sit still.”

They let that settle.

The shared model of Asterion rotated slowly between them: ring, Throne, hooks.

Annette broke the silence.

“Let’s count costs,” she said. “Because Lars will.”

“Good,” Leora said. “I’ve already started.”

She pulled up columns.

“Best case,” she said. “We burn in fast, keep our fire clean, strip the Maggot Throne’s guns and boarding spines, land Anton’s Iron Line on their hull and the ring decks, and push corridor by corridor until Karr Veyl either runs or dies. Minimised damage to stabilizer. Gate remains functional. We pay in ships and blood, but the artery breathes.”

“Worst case,” Annette said.

Leora switched columns.

“Worst case, we burn in, they use Resolute’s main batteries without caring about no-fire cones, hit something vital, and the ring cascades. Stabilizer fails. Corridor collapses. Orth and Halcyon choke. We still kill some pirates, but we break the artery. Freehold screams, Cindral has an excuse to come ‘restore order’, Concordant writes us out of the story, and we’ve spent lives to turn a problem into a crater.”

“Middle case?” Annette asked.

“We bloody each other,” Leora said. “Maggot Throne survives, we survive, the gate is limping. The artery becomes a constant warzone instead of a functional lane. We earn the hatred of everyone who depended on smooth transit there and did not ask for our interference.”

Annette nodded slowly.

“You sound like you’re arguing against moving,” she said.

“I’m laying out what happens if we do nothing versus what happens if we move badly,” Leora said. “There’s another column.”

She opened it.

“Call it ‘Somebody Else’,” she said. “We stay on Freehold’s escort chain, we send reports, we let Concordant or Cindral or some joint blessed task force act in a month or two. Maybe they succeed. Maybe they don’t. Either way, when the story of Asterion is told, our name appears in a footnote: ‘Hjertstedt noted the problem and carried on with their contract.’”

Annette looked at the numbers without speaking.

“You didn’t write a ‘no one moves’ column,” she said.

“There’s no such thing,” Leora said. “Someone always moves. If it’s not us, it will be Karr Veyl when he decides one gate is not enough.”

Annette exhaled.

“The Choir’s view?” Leora asked.

Off-screen, Mira’s voice floated faintly through Annette’s pickup.

“The artery is already under a knife,” she murmured. “If you don’t push that hand away, it will cut deeper. If you push clumsily, you might drive it in. But the hand will not stop on its own.”

Leora allowed herself a tight smile.

“Poetic,” she said. “For a brain in a jar.”

“Be polite to your instruments,” Annette said. “They make you look smarter.”

Leora tapped her console.

“I’m writing Lars a simple conclusion,” she said. “Given current deployment, response times, and political paralysis, House Hjertstedt is the only actor who can realistically contest Asterion before occupation solidifies. That’s not pride, that’s geometry.”

“And luck,” Annette said. “Don’t forget to write luck. He’ll hear it in your numbers anyway, but it helps him trust you when you admit it.”

Leora shrugged.

“Call it positional fortune,” she said. “We accepted an escort contract near Orth. You chose to park Veil-of-Glass in reach of Crown relays. Karr Veyl chose Asterion because he thought no one serious was paying attention. The pattern landed here.”

She paused, then added quietly:

“And Lars has been training us for a gate war since before any of us were born.”

Annette’s mouth twitched.

“There it is,” she said. “The real column: opportunity. Asterion is ugly, but it’s also the exact test he’s been waiting for. Take a rotting artery, cut the rot out, and hold it against everyone else. That’s his doctrine in one ring.”

“Then we frame it so he can’t ignore it,” Leora said.

They composed together.

Leora drafted, Annette cut.

Each line was stripped down to data and consequences.

*Asterion: structure intact, control seized. Maggot Throne welded to stabilizer. Crown-level asset Karr Veyl in open control. Harmonics confirm non-Republic hand on pulse. Throughput maintained under enemy schedule.*

*Major powers: observed delay. Freehold adjusting premiums, not committing fleets. Cindral citing jurisdiction. Concordant stalled in Assembly procedures. Aniconate more concerned with rites than relief.*

*House Hjertstedt: Crimson Guard and Iron Line positioned within two-jump response window. All other comparable forces require multiple jumps and non-trivial political overhead.*

*Conclusion: Within \~72 standard hours, House Hjertstedt can act as sole decisive military responder. After that window, any move risks direct collision with other great-power forces and entanglement in their claims.*

Leora added a quiet line at the bottom in her own name.

*Personal assessment: If we do not move now, we will face a stronger enemy later under worse terms. If we move now and succeed, Orth–Halcyon becomes our artery by fact before anyone else can write a law about it.*

Annette appended another, under hers.

*Personal assessment: Choir and Black Veil attest that gate integrity can be preserved with disciplined fire doctrine. We believe Crimson Guard + Iron Line are uniquely suited to this kind of surgical brutality. This is the war you bred us for.*

They signed it with their crests.

Annette routed it to Eternal Crown under Crown encryption.

Leora mirrored it up the same channel.

For a moment after the send, there was nothing to do but watch the model spin.

“Do you ever get tired,” Leora asked, “of being the one who hands Lars the matches when he’s already standing in a room full of dry kindling?”

Annette’s gaze flicked to her.

“No,” she said. “I get tired of watching other people play with candles until they burn down the whole house.”

She paused.

“And this time,” she added, “the people at Asterion are already on fire.”

Leora thought of Karr’s hollow eyes. Of the bodies on the Throne. Of the refugee child weeping in the decontam bay when they’d pulled families off Distant Field.

“Then we make the fire ours,” she said.

She closed the channel.

Now it was up to Lars.

Outside the analysis bay, Valdemar’s engines rumbled a little deeper as they slid into Orth’s jump throat, committing themselves to the path.

On Veil-of-Glass, the Choir floated in their frames, listening to the arteries.

In Eternal Crown’s war hall, a Patriarch was about to decide whether to throw his blood into a meat-grinder for a gate.

The window was open.

It wouldn’t stay that way for long.

Prime filled half the sky.

From Eternal Crown’s command spire, the world below was a dark marble wrapped in a cage of light. The megastructure around it—the great defense ring—glowed with slow, pulsing bands where shield nodes cycled and rail batteries slept with one eye open.

Above that, in the high lanes, von Hjertstedt fleets traced patient orbits: bastions and carriers and knife-ships, all tagged and tracked in Lars’ central holo.

He stood with his hands on the rail, broad shoulders still despite his age, watching the arteries.

“Update,” he said.

The holo shifted.

Prime’s local grid contracted, making room for a broader view.

Gate icons flared: the local Prime gate, heavy with inbound convoys. Further out, Orth and its own gate. Further still, a pulsing node tagged **ASTERION**.

Tiny badges sat beside it: Freehold, Cindral, Concordant, Aniconate. The old powers, attached to the artery like barnacles, each with their own claims and promises.

And now, a crooked crown.

The Black Veil brief floated above the center: Annette’s and Leora’s joint text, the Maggot Throne image frozen mid-broadcast, harmonic graphs clustered like medical charts around a failing organ.

Lars had read it twice already.

Once as a commander.

Once as a merchant.

He read it now as a father.

“Choir confirms?” he asked, not looking away.

His intelligence chief, a wiry woman with iron hair pulled tight, tapped her slate.

“Veil-of-Glass harmonics match our own deep-net scouts,” she said. “We cross-checked against Karr’s personal cube from Distant Field. It all sings the same song: Asterion’s pulse is under a new hand. Not Republic. Not ours. Carrion Crown.”

“Freehold’s response?” Lars asked.

“Incremental,” she said. “They’re raising premiums, tightening exclusions. Jast Kora filed a personal recommendation to treat Asterion as occupied, but the Council sat on it. They’ve sent ‘concerned inquiries’ to Cindral and the Concordant. No fleets moved.”

“Cindral?” Lars asked.

“Prefect Sarine replied that without a formal collapse of Republican authority, they have no legal pretext for intervention,” the chief said. “She suggested Freehold coordinate with the Republic.”

“Republic,” Lars repeated softly.

The word tasted like dust.

“Concordant?” he asked.

“Admiral Rhun is pushing for Assembly debate,” she said. “The earliest slot is in three days. After that, they’d need a vote and at least twenty days’ movement. He knows that. He’s buying time to see what we do.”

Lars nodded once.

“And our house?” he asked. “Where are my blood and steel?”

The holo zoomed.

Icons lit in crimson.

Valdemar near Orth gate, arrow already bending toward the throat. Steelbridge a jump behind, still in the process of peeling away from a garrison orbit. Other von fleets—Christer, Daniel, Leo, Lowa—scattered on distant contracts, out of immediate play.

“Joel has accepted Patriarchal override,” the chief said. “He’s detaching from his Freehold escort duties and vectoring for Asterion. Anton has acknowledged the same order and is repositioning Iron Line for follow-up insertion.”

“And the others?” Lars asked.

“Daniel and Christer are on the far spokes,” she said. “Even with priority jumps, they’d arrive after the first break. Leo and Lowa are tied into separate contracts we’ll have to bleed to reassign. They can form later waves or hold Asterion once it’s taken—if it’s taken.”

Lars’ eyes stayed on the icons for Joel and Anton.

The heir and the hammer.

He reached out and spun the Asterion model with a flick of his fingers.

The ring turned, showing the stabilizer core, the Maggot Throne welded along one arc, hooks jutting like teeth. Harmonic bands pulsed over it, the Choir’s abstract way of saying *not dead yet*.

“How bad if we do nothing?” he asked.

The chief did not sugarcoat.

“Asterion becomes a permanent throne-nest inside a critical artery,” she said. “Karr Veyl controls Orth–Halcyon. He taxes traffic under his own terms. He’ll favour his allies and bleed his enemies. Freehold will adapt, write new contracts, swallow losses. Cindral and Concordant will grumble, but unless he declares a state, they’ll treat it as banditry with extra steps.”

“And us?” Lars asked.

“We lose leverage,” she said. “Right now, we’re the small house with two major gateholdings: Prime and a growing stake in Asterion’s region. If we stay on the sidelines while a crown nails a dreadnought to a ring, every faction that pays us for ‘arterial security’ will remember that the next time they choose a protector.”

“So reputation,” Lars said. “And money.”

“And logistics,” she added. “If Veyl holds Asterion, he can choke or favour whichever contracts he wants. We live on tolls and transit. Let a pirate determine who eats, and our own bids will have his thumb on the scale.”

Lars turned the model again.

“How bad if we move and fail?” he asked.

The chief’s jaw clenched.

“Bad,” she said. “We send Valdemar and Steelbridge into a throat controlled by a hostile dreadnought. We fight near a stabilizer being run by someone who doesn’t care if it breaks. If we lose, we lose two of our heaviest hulls and the heir. Iron Line dies in corridors, turned into meat for the Crown’s hooks. House Hjertstedt becomes a story told in the past tense. Freehold writes off the loss and buys protection from someone else.”

“Gate?” Lars asked.

“Could survive,” she said. “Could crack. Depends on how clean Leora can keep our fire and how reckless Karr Veyl is feeling. If the ring collapses while everyone knows we’re the ones who triggered the fight, the blame will be ours, no matter whose shot actually broke it.”

He grunted.

“And how bad if we move and succeed?” he asked.

She blinked.

“Sir?”

“Every victory has a cost,” Lars said. “Count it.”

She took a breath.

“We lose ships,” she said. “Valdemar and Steelbridge will take hits. We lose people—Crimson Guard, Iron Line, gatewrights. The House will write new names on walls. Even with perfect doctrine, some rounds go wild. Some compartments flood. Some boarding pods don’t come home.”

She pointed at the model.

“Asterion itself will be scarred. Struts blown out, decks gutted. The Maggot Throne will either be a twisted mass of metal we have to scrape off the ring or a captured asset that everyone will demand we surrender in the name of ‘balance.’”

Lars smiled, a small, sharp thing.

“And politics?” he asked.

“Cindral will file protests,” she said. “Concordant will hold emergency Assemblies about ‘private forces unilaterally seizing common arteries.’ Freehold will complain in public and negotiate in private. Aniconate will declare we’ve profaned a structure they already thought profane.”

“And the lane?” Lars asked.

“Open,” she said. “Under our guns. Under our tolls. With our crest on every manifest.”

Silence settled between them.

Below, Prime turned in its cage.

“You sound like you’ve already decided,” the chief said quietly.

“I have not,” Lars said. “Not properly. My blood has. My merchants have. That’s not the same as the House deciding.”

He let go of the rail.

“Bring the Inner Council,” he said. “War and ledger. Five minutes.”

They met in the war hall, a long chamber whose walls were lined with old hull plates bearing the scars of previous battles: burn marks, punctures, the occasional carved name.

The central table was a hollow oval of light.

Asterion floated over it like a sick halo.

Around Lars stood:

* The intelligence chief.
* The Master of Ledgers, thin and sharp-eyed.
* The Marshal of Fleets, heavyset, his uniform still smelling faintly of machine oil.
* The House Advocate, draped in formal gray.
* A gatewright elder, skin inked with old stabilizer diagrams.

Lars didn’t waste words.

“You’ve all read Annette’s and Leora’s brief,” he said. “You’ve seen Karr Veyl’s throne.”

He gestured, and the Maggot Throne image hung above the table: bodies on rails, hooks, spike-plates.

“This is not a rumor,” he said. “This is not a minor raid. Asterion has been taken. The artery still moves, but under an enemy’s hand.”

He looked at each of them.

“I want objections,” he said. “Now, before we move. Because once we do, there will be no graceful way to step back.”

The Master of Ledgers went first.

“Freehold will fine us,” he said. “We will break contract with them at Orth by diverting Joel. Penalties will be significant. They may freeze us out of future bids.”

Lars tilted his head.

“Can we afford it?” he asked.

“With current reserves and projected tolls from Prime and Asterion’s lesser siblings, yes,” the Master said. “If we take Asterion and hold it, the penalties become rounding errors.”

“Advocate?” Lars asked.

The House Advocate spread his hands.

“In law, we have no standing,” he said. “No treaty gives us the right to unilaterally ‘liberate’ Asterion. Republic nominally owns it, though its control is paper-thin. Cindral and Concordant consider it a common artery under shared stewardship in practice. If we move, we become aggressors in their eyes.”

“And if we succeed?” Lars asked.

“Then we become a fact,” the Advocate said. “Law bends to facts, eventually. But we will face sanctions, trade pushes, perhaps unified pressure to ‘internationalize’ the gate. We will be told to share what we bled for.”

“And we will decline,” Lars said.

The Advocate smiled thinly.

“Of course,” he said. “But be aware: we will be alone in that refusal at first.”

The Marshal of Fleets grunted.

“I object to the notion that we will be alone,” he said. “Our steel will be with us.”

He tapped the floating icons of Valdemar and Steelbridge.

“Joel and Anton are ready,” he said. “Valdemar is in fighting trim. Steelbridge has her boarding bays full and her tanks fueled. Crimson Guard can handle the space kill, Iron Line can handle the decks. We’ve trained for this sort of artery fight. If anyone can cut a throne off a ring without killing the gate, it’s those two.”

The gatewright elder made a low sound.

“If they remember the blue-lines,” she said. “If they respect the lattice.”

“They will,” Lars said.

“Will they?” she pressed. “In the middle of being shot at by a dreadnought that doesn’t care where the beams go? Leora is disciplined. Karr Veyl is not. One misjudged barrage, one panic volley—”

Her fingers traced invisible patterns.

“The stabilizer can tolerate stress,” she said. “But not mockery. If they treat it like a mere battlefield instead of an organ, it will fail.”

Lars nodded.

“What is your recommendation?” he asked her.

“Bring gatewrights with them,” she said. “Not just the usual repair crews. Give them authority to veto certain shots. Embed them on the bridges. Let the lattice have a voice in the room where orders are given.”

“Done,” Lars said.

The intelligence chief spoke next.

“My objection is simple,” she said. “We are underestimating Karr Veyl if we treat him only as a butcher. He has already shown he understands timing, optics, and internal rot. We may be walking into traps he set months ago, using our own doctrines against us. Expect mutiny attempts, sabotage, and propaganda aimed at our own crews.”

Lars’s mouth tightened.

“Then tell Joel and Anton,” he said. “No Gray Boxes. No ‘trusted locals’ on their decks. Black Guard screening if necessary. We’ve seen what rot did to Asterion. It will not do the same to us.”

He looked around the circle.

“Anyone arguing we should stand down?” he asked.

Silence.

Many other message requests are still in the pending section — some individuals have written extremely inappropriate things, while others have simply asked, ‘Are you single? Come talk to me,’ ‘Let’s go out,’ ‘Let’s have coffee,’ or ‘I will send you roses, share your address.’
I honestly find myself thinking, what is wrong with people? They create anonymous accounts and then feel free to say all sorts of nonsense under that cover.

However, my previous post did receive a few good comments, and the one or two people I chose to respond to have been decent so far, with no misbehaviour.

We’re married and have a little daughter who keeps life lively and fun. My hometown is just about an hour’s drive away, but my daily life is here now.

So far, I haven’t really built a new circle of friends here—most of my social connections are still back home. I’d love to change that and meet people around my age who enjoy good conversation, music, or cooking!

🎶 A bit about me:

* Big fan of jazz & blues
* I love to cook and bake - Recently had to get into Gluten-Free cooking
* Tech & IT enthusiast (I work as a controller for a social NGO)
* Love traveling and discovering new cultures (I’ve lived in Antwerp and Atlanta before)
* Politically interested, leaning left, always up for thoughtful discussions

✨ Just to be clear: I’m not looking for anything romantic or sexual—simply genuine friendships and connections.

If this sounds like someone you’d enjoy grabbing a coffee with, going to a concert, or just chatting about life, I’d be happy to connect!",2,1764062484.0,penpalsover30,0,1.0,False

You gave the AI a perfect, specific prompt. It gave you back a perfectly written, detailed answer... that was completely useless. It answered the question literally but missed your *intent* entirely. This is the most frustrating AI failure of all.

The problem isn't that the AI is stupid. It's that you sent it to the right city but forgot to provide a street address. Giving an AI a command without **Contextual Clarity** is like telling a GPS ""New York City"" and hoping you end up at a specific coffee shop in Brooklyn. You'll be in the right *area*, but you'll be hopelessly lost.

This is Linguistics Programming—it's about giving the AI a precise, turn-by-turn map to your goal. It’s the framework that ensures you and your AI always arrive at the same destination.

# Workflow: Still Getting Useless AI Answers? Try This 3-Step Map.

Use this 3-step ""GPS"" method to ensure your AI always understands your intent.

Step 1: Define the DESTINATION (The Goal)

Before you write, state the single most important outcome you need. What does ""done"" look like?

* **Example:** ""The goal is a 300-word blog post introduction that hooks the reader and states a clear thesis.""

Step 2: Define the LANDMARKS (The Key Entities)

List the specific nouns—the people, concepts, or products—that are the core subject of your request. This tells the AI what landmarks to look for.

* **Example:** ""The key entities are: 'Linguistics Programming,' 'AI users,' and 'prompting frustration.'""

Step 3: Define the ROUTE (The Relationship)

Explain the relationship between the landmarks. How do they connect? What is the story you are telling about them?

* **Example:** ""The relationship is: 'Linguistics Programming' (the solution) solves 'prompting frustration' (the problem) for 'AI users' (the audience).""

This workflow is effective because it uses the most important principle of **Linguistics Programming**: **Contextual Clarity**. By providing a goal, key entities, and their relationships, you create a perfect map that prevents the AI from ever getting lost again.",1,1764062432.0,LinguisticsPrograming,0,1.0,False

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

There are 3 couples and me and 2 guys are single. I started to like this one guy more and more after a couple of months of being in the group (we all got friends just a year ago).

I am a photographer, so he got a photoshoot from me around 7 months ago. I offered him to watch a movie at his place afterwards and we had a lovely day (he also bought us food in a restaurant). It was nice, but no romantic moments. Later I asked him to the museum and he said yes, tho he didn’t want to have a lunch together afterwards.

I realised the coldness from him and tried to not push further, as back then he divorced less than a year ago.

Closer to the summer I noticed that he wants to interact with me more - when we had some group discussions in the friends chat, he could go to my private messages to discuss something more. Sending reels/replying to my stories. Also it was always nice to talk to him during our friends gatherings, and on the way home.

In september he had a birthday and I gave him a t-shirt specifically made for him with a quote he mentioned a few months before that.

He also can message something after these friends gatherings to me.

A few weeks ago he said we had a nice conversation during the friends gathering, and offered to meet up for coffee to discuss more. But then there was a trouble in the public transportation and he decided not to come to the city (we supposed to meet before the friends gathering and he didn’t come for both). And then I left for the vacation and got back and he didn’t get back to the idea of meeting up just for two of us.

We share some interest, he seems very gentle and empathic, he’s very smart and intelligent. I really would love to be with someone like him. I understand his divorce story and therefore the coldness towards me, but some small interactions when he’s interested in me or we discuss something that’s interesting for both of us make me more and more attracted to him.

Do you think it’s something that can develop (given that he’s initiating small talks and even offered to meet up for the first time a couple of weeks ago, but it was interrupted). Should I offer to meet up again?  I also thought of just saying straightforward that I like him and ask if anything is possible from his side.

We’re both immigrants in a foreign country and the connection with someone from your homeland that has a lot of similar values with you means a lot. I wanna go further with him, but I don’t know if he’s ready after his divorce, etc. I wonder if this can develop to love, or it’s a forever friend zone.",1,1764061997.0,TwoHotTakes,8,1.0,False

After working on this for a while, I’ve finally pushed **Leedsy** to production.

It’s a tool to filter leads from different platforms and manage them all in one place. I built it because I was tired of jumping between tabs and losing track of potential clients.

**The honest situation:** I’m not trying to make a profit right now. I’m in the ""validate and fix bugs"" phase. I need real users to break the tool, find edge cases, and tell me what sucks.

Because of this, I’ve set the Black Friday pricing to literally just cover my server and AI API costs:

* **Pro:** €5/mo (or €39/year)
* **Premium:** €12/mo (or €99/year)

It costs less than a coffee to handle your lead gen.

If you want to try it out and help an indie hacker refine his MVP, I’d appreciate it massively.

I am a photographer, so he got a photoshoot from me around 7 months ago. I offered him to watch a movie at his place afterwards and we had a lovely day (he also bought us food in a restaurant). It was nice, but no romantic moments. Later I asked him to the museum and he said yes, tho he didn’t want to have a lunch together afterwards.

I realised the coldness from him and tried to not push further, as back then he divorced less than a year ago.

Closer to the summer I noticed that he wants to interact with me more - when we had some group discussions in the friends chat, he could go to my private messages to discuss something more. Sending reels/replying to my stories. Also it was always nice to talk to him during our friends gatherings, and on the way home.

In september he had a birthday and I gave him a t-shirt specifically made for him with a quote he mentioned a few months before that.

He also can message something after these friends gatherings to me.

A few weeks ago he said we had a nice conversation during the friends gathering, and offered to meet up for coffee to discuss more. But then there was a trouble in the public transportation and he decided not to come to the city (we supposed to meet before the friends gathering and he didn’t come for both). And then I left for the vacation and got back and he didn’t get back to the idea of meeting up just for two of us.

We share some interest, he seems very gentle and empathic, he’s very smart and intelligent. I really would love to be with someone like him. I understand his divorce story and therefore the coldness towards me, but some small interactions when he’s interested in me or we discuss something that’s interesting for both of us make me more and more attracted to him.

Do you think it’s something that can develop (given that he’s initiating small talks and even offered to meet up for the first time a couple of weeks ago, but it was interrupted). Should I offer to meet up again?  I also thought of just saying straightforward that I like him and ask if anything is possible from his side.

We’re both immigrants in a foreign country and the connection with someone from your homeland that has a lot of similar values with you means a lot. I wanna go further with him, but I don’t know if he’s ready after his divorce, etc. I wonder if this can develop to love, or it’s a forever friend zone.",1,1764061908.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

Some time ago I purchased a Cervelo Soloist Ultegra di2 with Reserve wheels(40/44). I have had the intention to swap this bike for something more racy/aero.

A few days ago I went across Winsapce page and noticed a sweet deals on T1600 and SLC5. Besicly 20% off due to BF and some coupons. Having a full DA build with modern carbon wheels and integrated handlebar sounds to good to pass...

I live in pancake flat area. Where I need to make serious effort to plan the route to hit 1k elevation gain...

I do 20-25kkm(road, xc and indoors) in a year. My FTP fits me a the very bottom on A category. I do at least two centuries a week and multiple +200km in a year(my PB from this year is 4 x 200+ in a week). Usually average 500-600km a week. I do take part in some completion from time to time. I love to race with my mates on our ""coffee/easy/recovery rides"":D

The question is/are:
What would be your guestimation about performance benefits from changing the bike from Solois to SLC/T1600 with 60mm deep rims? Do you have some personal comparison between those Winspace bikes compare to wester brands? Or the margin would be soo slim that I should shut up and shave my legs to get more gains?:D",2,1764061859.0,ChineseCarbon,0,1.0,False

After working on this for a while, I’ve finally pushed **Leedsy** to production.

It’s a tool to filter leads from different platforms and manage them all in one place. I built it because I was tired of jumping between tabs and losing track of potential clients.

**The honest situation:** I’m not trying to make a profit right now. I’m in the ""validate and fix bugs"" phase. I need real users to break the tool, find edge cases, and tell me what sucks.

Because of this, I’ve set the Black Friday pricing to literally just cover my server and AI API costs:

* **Pro:** €5/mo (or €39/year)
* **Premium:** €12/mo (or €99/year)

It costs less than a coffee to handle your lead gen.

If you want to try it out and help an indie hacker refine his MVP, I’d appreciate it massively.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Their brain is doing constant back-and-forth translation, and that tiny delay destroys fluency. The real breakthrough happens when English stops being a “subject” and starts becoming the language your mind actually uses to think.

The way to get there isn’t magic. It’s daily mental training.

Start with your inner voice. Whatever you normally tell yourself—“I need coffee,” “I’m late,” “where’s my phone”—say it in English in your head. It’ll feel slow and fake at first, but the brain adapts shockingly fast when you keep feeding it simple English thoughts.

Then speak to yourself when you’re alone. Narrate what you’re doing while cooking or walking. Short, dumb sentences work best: “I’m cutting the onions,” “It’s cold today,” “I’m hungry.” You’re not trying to sound smart. You’re wiring your brain to default to English.

And stop trying to transfer long, elegant sentences from your native language. English thinking is short, direct, and casual. “I’m exhausted. Today was rough.” That’s enough. Simpler thoughts beat perfectly translated ones.

Also: thinking is private. Nobody sees your mistakes. Messy English thoughts are still better than clean translations.

Surround yourself with the language—shows, podcasts, whatever. You don’t need full comprehension. You need your brain to get used to the rhythm so English becomes the path of least resistance.

When you learn new words, visualize them instead of translating them. See the apple, not the word in your first language. It cuts out the mental middleman.

It’s basically a gym routine for your mind. The moment your brain starts lifting the weight *directly* in English, everything—speaking, listening, confidence—levels up fast.

Anyone else notice that the moment you stop translating, English suddenly feels like a place you can actually live in?",1,1764061576.0,advanced_english,0,1.0,False

What makes Paidwork student-friendly is that it doesn’t require fixed hours. You can open it between lectures, while commuting, or when you’re just scrolling on your phone. You earn through surveys, playing games, watching ads, and completing simple tasks. There’s also some passive earning features, which are perfect when you’re studying or doing assignments.

Compared to other earning apps, I like that Paidwork offers several ways to make money. So if surveys are low one day, you can switch to games or special tasks instead. It feels more flexible than apps that only focus on one thing.

The payout process is also pretty smooth and you don’t have to wait forever to withdraw your earnings. For students who just want an easy side income without a complicated setup, it works well.

1p67fzj,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chevtech.influx_feeder,Influx Feeder,"I'm a heavy InfluxDB user, running it for everything from **IoT and home automation to network monitoring**. It’s brilliant, but I kept running into one small, annoying gap: capturing the data points that simply can't be fully automated.

I'm talking about metrics like:

* The number of coffees you drink ☕
* The pressure reading on your car's tires 🚗
* The weekly electricity consumption reading at the local club.

These smaller, human-generated data points are crucial for a complete picture, but the manual logging process was always clunky and often led to missed data.

That’s why I created **Influx Feeder**.

It’s an **offline-first** mobile app designed for quick, trivial data input into your InfluxDB instance (Cloud or self-hosted). You define your own custom metrics and record data in seconds.

**Whether you are a maker, work in IT, are conscientious about your fitness, or simply love data of all sorts, this app will very likely help you.**



# Key Features for Fellow Enthusiasts:



1. **Offline Reliability:** This is key for self-hosters! If your home connection drops, or you're miles away from your server, the data queues in the app's dedicated **""outbox.""** It pushes to InfluxDB only when a connection is re-established. **Never lose a metric again.**
2. **Custom Metrics:** Define exactly what you need to track, from floats and integers to simple strings.
3. **Trivial Input:** Designed for speed and minimal effort.

I've got a bunch of improvements lined up, but I'm eager for some real-world feedback from the community. If you use InfluxDB and have ever wished for an easier way to get those ""un-automatable"" metrics into your stack, check it out!",0,1764060138.0,influxdb,0,0.5,False
1p67fo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_VistaSeller/comments/1p67fo2/i_built_a_tool_to_stop_guessing_about_competitors/,I Built a Tool to Stop Guessing About Competitors (50+ Amazon Sellers Tested It),"Hey fellow Amazon sellers—if you’re scrolling my profile, you know I’m all about cutting through the chaos of FBA 👋

If you’ve ever stayed up till 2 AM copying a competitor’s pricing into a Google Sheet, only to find they changed it again by morning… we’re twins. Last quarter, I lost a $3k/week listing because I missed a rival’s coupon launch—total gut punch. That’s when I stopped complaining and started building.

After 3 months of scraping data (and way too much coffee), I launched a tool that tracks **every move competitors make**—pricing, stock levels, keyword rankings, even their A+ content updates—all in one dashboard. No more switching between 5 tabs, no more manual updates, no more “whoops, I missed that.”

Here’s what actually makes it useful (not just another “AI tool” buzzword):

* **Real-time alerts**: Pings your phone/email if a competitor drops prices 10%+ or runs out of stock—saved me twice last month when rivals tried to undercut my best-seller
* **Keyword spy**: Shows which exact terms they’re ranking for that you’re not (I found 3 high-conversion keywords in 5 minutes—added $800 to my weekly sales)
* **Profit calculator**: Automatically factors in their fees, shipping, and promotions to show if their “low price” is actually profitable (turns out 40% of my rivals were selling at a loss—wild)

I’ve had 120+ fellow sellers test it over the past month, and the biggest feedback was “finally, something that doesn’t require a CS degree to use.” One guy said it cut his competitor research time from 3 hours/day to 15 minutes—his words, not mine.

Since so many of you have asked about my “secret weapon” for competitor research lately, I wanted to officially share the tool I built. There’s a 7-day free trial with no credit card required—no strings attached, just want you to actually test it and see if it solves that “spreadsheet chaos” we all hate.

Link is in my profile (Reddit’s rules hate direct links here, sorry!). But if you’ve got questions—how the data scraping works, if it integrates with Seller Central, even if it’s worth it for small listings—drop a comment. I’m here all day, and I promise no sales pitch spam. Just a fellow seller who’s been in your spreadsheet hell.

P.S. If you test it, let me know what you’d add! I’m already working on a feature to track Amazon’s algorithm changes—your input will make it better.",1,1764060103.0,u_VistaSeller,0,1.0,False

In the palpitating heart of modern India, the atmosphere is a battleground of sensory contradictions. Here, the ancient, cloying smog of sandalwood incense wages a silent war against the sharp, metallic ozone tang of overheating electronics. This is a tale as old as the *Mahabharata*, yet it flickers with the transience of a Snapchat story. This is the world of ""Reel Baba"".

The narrative unfolds in a Delhi that refuses to sleep, a city illuminated by a jarring duality of lights. On one side, there is the soft, wavering golden glow of oil *diyas* flickering desperately in roadside temples, casting long, dancing shadows against soot-stained walls. On the other, the harsh, unblinking blue strobe of smartphone screens illuminates millions of faces in the dark, turning human skin into a ghostly, monochromatic canvas.

Here, we meet Aryan Sharma. He is a ten-year-old boy whose reality is suspended in a purgatory between the organic scent of fresh marigolds, damp with morning dew, and the synthetic, metallic taste of viral fame. He was born into a legacy that had curdled like spoiled milk—the olfactory remnant of his father Gajesh's failed ""Sweet Shop"" empire. Now, Aryan has become the unwitting vessel for a new kind of salvation, one dictated not by scripture, but by the algorithm.

This novella, woven from the vibrant yet abrasive fabric of India's influencer culture, captures the cacophony of public opinion. It is the audio-visual clash of the digital roar of ""Jai Shree Ram"" in comment sections against the cynical, silent laughter of meme-makers on X. Aryan's life begins in the pre-dawn silence of 3:30 AM, a time that smells of night jasmine and damp earth. But as his father, a man whose ambition exudes the scent of desperate cologne and stale coffee, transforms devotion into content, that sacred silence is shattered.

The rhythmic, organic *click-click-click* of the mala beads is replaced by the relentless, digital *ping-ping-ping* of notifications. ""Reel Baba"" asks the reader to physically touch the texture of this life: the smooth, cool silk of a guru's robes rubbing against the scratchy, cheap polyester of a green-screen backdrop. It asks you to taste the temple *laddoo*, once sweet with jaggery, turning into the bitter pill of public scrutiny. As Aryan's follower count swells to a million, the narrative navigates the blinding, epileptic flashbulbs of awards ceremonies and the murky, shadowy corners of internet trolling. It is a sensory overload of devotion and deception, asking: in an age where algorithms dictate reality, can the fragrance of true *bhakti* survive the sterility of the server farm?",1,1764059899.0,digitalpolymath,0,1.0,False

**Pros:**

1. The ground experience in DBR was smooth with no problems. Boarding was orderly and on time.  
2. The flight departed and arrived early as well.  
3. My prebooked pasta meal was extremely delicious, at par with pastas that I have eaten on the ground. Surprisingly, it was also accompanied by a bread roll, a sweet and coffee. This was one of the best inflight means I have had.  
4. The seat was comfortable and well-padded. The legroom was also quite generous especially when compared to Indigo and Air India Express. However, it seemed that the seat was not fitted by SpiceJet and was the same one from when the aircraft was originally owned by AirBerlin in Germany, which might be the reason for the comfort.

**Cons:**  
  
1. The seat recline was negligible.  
2. The crew were quite inattentive and did not seem to care much about safety. Before takeoff, they did not really pay attention to whether passengers had their tray tables opened or their phones not on flight mode.  
3. The crew decided to serve hot coffee despite turbulence, which ended up spilling and burning many passengers including me. Even after this, the crew did not care much about the injured passengers and did not offer any sort of medical aid.  
4. After we arrived in Delhi, it took almost half an hour for the bags to arrive on the belt.

  
**Conclusion:** Even though SpiceJet seems to be improving, it still has glaring problems that need to be sorted in order for the airline to become a viable option for passengers.",2,1764059713.0,AirTravelIndia,0,1.0,False

[Budget around £150],"Hi all as the title suggests I am looking for a grinder, I primarily want it for decaf as that's what I mostly drink in after 2pm (I have one on the BBE which is shared in the family and tbh it's a pain to switch beans) so looking to buy something decent that can last me a decent while.

I am looking at the Encore ESP which I think ticks most boxes and I can find it at £135.96 on Amazon currently with 2 year warranty or 1 year warranty for £123.96 from HitCoffe but only has 1 year warranty from the looks of it.

The other option I saw is the mignon Zero 55s 15L fro £199 from CoffeeFriend but I have heard mixed reviews from them.

I would imagine people would tell me to get the Mignon for espresso, I am just wary of the website reviews and whether I'd be able to taste a difference between ESP Vs mignon zero, although I stared my budget is 150 I can stretch to £199 if it's legit and it's a significant difference over many years.

I would like to avoid anything that has a sketchy Chinese warranty and DF54 would be £250+ so double the ESP so I am sticking with ESP Vs Zero for now.

Thank you in advance.

I commute most of the time, so accessibility is important. My budget for **rent** is around **₱25k (preferably lower if possible)**.

Would really appreciate any recommendations or insights. Thank you! 🙏",2,1764058864.0,buhaydigital,2,1.0,False

I just wanted to share another living rent event that is taking place locally, in case anyone is interested in going along on Saturday. You can join the campaign or get more details about the union on the day. Details below. 😊

‐----------------------------------------------------------------

Rally for Mckerrell Street Playpark this Saturday!

Seedhill residents have been deprived of their playpark on McKerrell Street by the Council who removed all of its equipment years ago. They have left an area with nothing in it but a random collection of rusty poles. This part of Seedhill has a large number of young families who need a safe place for kids to play next to their home. People here are fed up! Living Rent Paisley members in Seedhill are holding a rally in the former playpark on Saturday the 29th of November at 11.30am to 1.30pm to demand that the Council rebuild the playpark. There will be games for kids, tea, coffee and lentil soup. Come along, bring the kids and confront your local councillors.

1p672r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1p672r7/vibecoded_a_trakt_tv_audience_drop_detector_in_10/,Vibe-Coded a TRAKT TV Audience Drop Detector in <10 Minutes using Gemini!,"I just had one of those moments that makes you realize how crazy fast development is getting. I had an idea for a simple utility: A tool that analyzes TV show data from Trakt, specifically tracking audience drops by comparing every episode's viewer count back to the baseline (S01E01). Why? Because I wanted a quick visual cue (like a heatmap/grid) to see exactly where a show started losing steam, episode by episode, across seasons.

Instead of spending hours writing boilerplate, setting up components, and figuring out the API request throttling, I decided to ""vibe code"" this entire thing with Gemini.

The Process (It was ridiculously fast):

Prompt 1: ""Create a single-file React app using Tailwind CSS for Trakt TV show analysis. It needs an input field and should call the Trakt API to fetch stats for all episodes of a user-input show. The baseline must be S01E01.""

Prompt 2 (Iteration): ""Display the results as a color-coded grid/table, calculating the percentage retention relative to the S01E01 baseline. Use a different color for drops vs. audience gains.""

Prompt 3 (Debugging/Refining): ""Add logic for handling missing images and implementing a proper fetch-delay mechanism to respect API rate limits, displaying a loading progress bar during the process.""

The result is a fully functional, responsive single-file React app with simple logic, custom styling, and an effective API throttling mechanism. It even has both a detailed Table View and a quick visual Grid View!

I am genuinely blown away by the speed and complexity that Gemini handled. It wasn't just writing code; it was understanding the architectural need (single-file component, state management, simple API fetching, conditional UI rendering).

This is less about my coding skills and more about how incredible these LLM tools are becoming. If you're building utility apps, give this ""vibe-coding"" approach a try you might finish before your coffee gets cold.

TL;DR: Asked Gemini to build a specific, simple TV show audience drop detector app. It delivered a high-quality, fully functional React app in a single session. Time spent: <10 minutes of prompting.",2,1764058691.0,vibecoding,0,1.0,False
