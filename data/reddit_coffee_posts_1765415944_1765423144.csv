1pjmwpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pjmwpj/is_it_wrong_of_me_to_be_upset_with_my_friend_for/,Is it wrong of me to be upset with my friend for ghosting me?,"Alright first some context.

I (M 18) have been friends with my friend, Amy (F21) for about two years now and our mutual friend Edith (F20) for about one and half. Over this past summer we all got really close to each other, like closer than I have ever been with anyone else. This fall I left to attend college out of state as a freshman and Edith left to return to her school, also out of state.

I know this is a big change but we had gone through it with Edith in the past. However lately I had been feeling like Amy was distancing herself from both of us, messages sent in the group chat or to her directly would go unanswered for days on end and when she did respond she would just say she was busy. I understand how busy life can be but it doesn't take that long to just send a quick message.

I didn't share this because I just thought it was a natural symptom of long distance. I went back for Thanksgiving break and hung out with Edith as if months hadn't passed since the last time we saw each other however when I finally got to see Amy it was at a taproom with her new friends. I was excited to meet Amy's new friends because I assumed if they were anything like Amy they would be great but instead I found myself shunned and pushed aside at the event. (I was the only one not old enough to drink but this separation felt a lot deeper than that)

The final straw came when I sent Amy pictures of a note and old photos of herself that she had put in an envelope and given to me at the start of college. (It was one of those things where you open when you're sad or miss her). I sent her the photo and said I missed her and couldn't wait to see her at Christmas. Three days went by without a response and so I called Edith to talk to her about it. She told me she had been feeling the same way about Amy lately. We agreed to message her. I sent a long winded messages explaining how I felt like we had drifted apart and how I wanted to know if it was something I did and if she even wanted to see me anymore.

Amy responded saying that she did want to see me but felt that I hadn't been valuing her friendship enough recently (by not texting her as much as I used to when I was back home) and so she had decided to cut me off so that she could focus on her own life. Edith got a similar response. We all decided to meet for coffee when we are all back in town but I can't help but feel a little hurt by the whole thing. I didn't realize I hadn't been texting her enough, I would message her when something reminded me of her or when I saw something I thought she would like and responded to all her messages. Amy says she has just been busy but it felt cold and harsh to cut off a two year relationship (one where I had stated how much it meant to me in the past) by just ignoring me completely. Is it wrong of me for not agreeing with her? Am I not seeing another side of the story. Edith agrees with me but she can be hot headed at the time so I'm asking reddit.

He owns a law firm, he works quite often. He leaves early so I have a lot of open mornings, normally leaves at 5.

 Our plan was to have babies by now, but I got diagnosed with severe PMDD back in may and my treatment is birth control, so babies have obviously been pushed back.

One of the pieces of advice I was given was to find a hobby that is for me.

I considered a part time job but my man doesn’t think that’s a good idea so not looking for that suggestion.

I’ve been seeing a therapist and she said most of things i described doing revolved around him.. like I like to bake, cook, clean. She said everytime she asks about me, I answer with something related to him so she suggested I find something for me and I have tried but I can’t find anything

Also, I love the hair salon/beauty services already, she said it didn’t count because in the end it’s not for me which I disagree completely, but I want to atleast try and follow what she’s saying …so not looking for any suggestions like that!

I’m just looking for something I can do quietly, at home or at a coffee shop even.

It just has to be simple because I’m not smart at all. I tried crocheting and got very frustrated and gave up🫠

I also tried reading books but I never focused long enough to finish one lol

Does anyone have suggestions on something I can do that’s easy, but fun? I love artsy stuff, fashion, makeup. I love movies but I don’t think I’d go see them alone

We live in Beverly Hills so if you’re nearby and even have a class or group suggestion? I can do anything between 5am-430pm. I can’t technically do evenings if I have to, only saying that because I have to make dinner haha

1pjmtih,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1pjmtih/im_exhausted_and_hes_mad/,I’m exhausted and he’s mad.,"I’m on day 7 of my 9 day work week, reaching almost 84 hours worked in a row. 
Today I REALLY felt the exhaustion, went into work with blood shot eyes, sore throat and raging nausea after I waited 30 minutes for my bus in the snow because it was running late because of the blizzard, had no time to grab a coffee this morning either so I dragged myself around work all day, hitting 25k steps. 
Before I got off work he texted me that he wanted me to buy him a lottery scratcher pack at his work because he couldn’t buy them himself because he’s an employee there, I said sure why not because my bus goes by his work anyway. 
I wait for my bus, it’s freezing rain at this point and he says he’s going on break so he’ll just pick me up, we go into his work and I get him his scratch tickets, after that he wanted me to go wait at the bus stop again because he noticed how tired I was and he wanted me to go home a rest, I leave. 
After one more hour added on to my commute home in the cold freezing weather for some scratch tickets, I make myself a bowl of soup and crawl into bed, finally. 
I ended up falling asleep, he gets home and wakes me up, tells me to get out of bed so we can play GTA. 
I get up, eyes half closed, hair a mess and he says “you don’t have to play you look really tired, it’s okay” and I asked him if he was sure and that I’m sorry I’m not in the mood to play video games. 
He then passive aggressively said “well I was really excited, now I’m frustrated because you didn’t communicate that you didn’t want to play, so yea I’m upset” 
LOOK AT MEEEE, I’m drained as all hell, my whole body hurts because I’ve been working like a dog for the past week and a half I thought it would be easy to assume that I wanna rest went I waddled into your fucking car, eyes still red look completely deflated of all life. 
All this over me not wanting to play GTA tonight because I’m tired. 
I’m working for us, to keep a roof over our head but it’s not appreciated because at the end of the night I didn’t want to sit in front of my computer with him to play a stupid video game. 
I wanted to scream and yell at him because you got to be fucking kidding me, but I have no energy. 
I’m so depressed, I want to get out of this mess. 
I’m 20 and I’m wasting my life and time at work trying to tend to him. But if I leave he’ll have nothing, he’ll be on the streets and I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I took away someone’s home. 
I don’t know what to say, I need help but idk where to start.

1pjmqu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pjmqu0/part_1_im_not_the_only_one_pulling_hairs_from_my/,[Part 1] I'm not the only one pulling hairs from my tongue. I wish I was.,"I was on mute thank god, half-listening to my project manager drone through the backlog, when I felt it.

That familiar tickle.

A hair caught somewhere between my tongue and the roof of my mouth...

\---

**Actually, before you read any further** **- I know**. I know how this will sound. I've been trying to figure out how to write this without sounding like I've completely lost it. But I need to put this somewhere. I need someone else to see it, because right now I'm not sure I trust my own perception of what's happening to me.

I'm 31. Software developer, fully remote since COVID. I live with my girlfriend Mary in a two-bedroom apartment in the suburbs of Columbus. I don't do drugs. I drink maybe twice a month. No history of mental illness, no hallucinations, no neurological issues. I had my wisdom teeth out at 22 and haven't been to a dentist since, which I'm not proud of, but it's relevant because I keep wondering if this is somehow my fault. If I missed something. If something got in.

\---

So anyways. I'd been lazy about shaving - working from home does that. I figured a beard hair had migrated during my morning coffee. I tongued at it absently, trying to work it forward, and when that didn't work, I reached up and pinched it between my thumb and forefinger.

It came out easily. I didn't even look at it - just spit into a tissue, balled it up, and threw it in the trash.

I really, *really* wish I'd looked at that tissue.

The only thing I remember was that my mouth tasted strange afterward. Metallic, like I'd been sucking on a handful of pennies. And something else - an ache deep in my throat - that faded before I could focus on it.

**Five days later:**

I'm in the shower, washing my face when I feel it again. But this time it's further back, almost at the base of my tongue, and when I try to work it forward, it doesn't move.

I spit a few times. Nothing. Hawk up from my throat. Nothing!

So I reach back there with my fingers - which, if you've ever tried to grab something off the back of your own tongue, you know is an exercise in gagging - and I finally manage to pinch it.

It doesn't come out easily.

There's resistance. Not like a hair caught in mucus. Like a hair caught in *skin*. Like pulling a splinter that's gone deep. I had to brace my other hand on the shower wall because the tugging sensation made my eyes water and my throat gag.

When it finally came free, I felt a tiny, sharp pop.

And something else. Something I didn't want to think about. A brief sensation of movement somewhere below my jaw, like a string being plucked.

I held the hair up in front of my face and took a close look at it.

Three inches long. Thin. Almost translucent in the harsh bathroom lighting, but not quite. There was something inside it.

A dark thread running through the center. Thin and delicate, like a vein.

It wasn't a beard hair.

I got out of the shower without drying off, and went straight to the mirror. Opened my mouth wide and pulled my tongue forward with my fingers.

A tiny red dot. Maybe a millimeter across. Right there on the surface of my tongue, about two-thirds of the way back. It looked like a pinprick, as if someone had stuck a needle through from underneath.

I stood there, dripping on the bathmat, staring at my own tongue for probably five minutes.

Then I did what any rational person would do: I Googled it.

""Hair growing from tongue.""

""Hair on tongue causes.""

""Hairy tongue syndrome.""

That last one returned results. It's a real thing, *lingua villosa*, where the papillae overgrow and look kind of hair-like. But every image looked nothing like what I'd pulled out of my mouth. Those were discolored patches. Texture changes. Not individual, distinct strands emerging from a single point.

I found nothing useful.

I told myself it was a fluke. Some kind of weird ingrown hair situation. The human body does strange things sometimes.

I put the strand in a plastic sandwich bag - some instinct toward evidence - and tried to forget about it.

When I checked the bag the next morning, the strand had curled into a tight spiral.

**Day 8**:

Morning coffee. That tickle again. I set my mug down slowly, like if I moved too fast it might burrow deeper.

I reached into my mouth.

Three strands this time.

Three.

One was wiry - thicker than the first, with almost a curl to it. The other two were silk-thin, almost invisible. All three came from different spots on my tongue, and all three left pinprick marks behind.

The metallic taste was stronger this time. It lingered for an hour. Underneath it was something else, something faintly sweet, like fruit just starting to rot.

**Day 9:**

Mary noticed me going to the bathroom a lot. I told her my stomach was bothering me - bad takeout - and she didn't push it.

But she watched me.

We've been together six years and by now, she can tell when I'm hiding something.

That night she asked why I'd bought sandwich bags.

""Meal prep,"" I said.

We don't meal prep.

**Day 10:**

I woke up gagging.

Something was wrapped around my tongue.

I frantically sat up in bed, heart hammering in my chest, and reached into my mouth with shaking fingers. A single strand of hair had wound itself around my tongue while I slept. Twice around, like a loose coil.

When I pulled it free, it was five inches long.

And for the first time I noticed something else.

It was *straight*. Perfectly straight. Not a single wave or curl to it, despite having been wrapped around my tongue for hours.

Hair doesn't do that. Even straightened hair has some memory. Some tendency to curve.

This was rigid. Like a strand of nylon. Like fishing line.

And when I held it up to the light from my phone, the dark thread inside seemed to shift ever so slightly. Just once.

I told myself it was a trick of the light.

That night, I didn't go back to sleep.

**Day 11:**

I couldn't stop running my finger over my tongue.

Something had changed.

The texture was different. Slightly rougher in certain spots, like fine-grit sandpaper.

When I looked in the mirror, I could see them.

Pores. Follicles. Tiny openings scattered across the surface of my tongue like the skin on a plucked chicken.

Some of them had little dark dots in the center. Like something was sitting just beneath the surface.

Waiting.

One of them, near the back, was larger than the others. When I pressed my finger against it, I felt something press back.

**Day 12:**

That's today.

I've pulled six so far, and it's only the afternoon. I'm keeping them in a ziplock bag. Mary's at work, so I don't have to hide in the bathroom. I just sit at my desk, pull one free, drop it in the bag, try to keep working.

The bag has maybe twenty now.

I keep holding it up to the light, studying them. A mess of different lengths, different thicknesses, all knotted together like a nest. But they all have that same rigid quality. That same dark thread running through each of them.

And here's the thing that's really starting to scare me.

When I pull them out now, I feel something else. A tugging sensation deep in my stomach that instantly makes me nauseous. Like there's a thread running from my tongue all the way down into my gut - like whatever's in my mouth is connected to something further inside.

The pain fades fast.

The tugging doesn't.

\---

**I found them by accident.**

I was deep in medical forums looking for weird symptom clusters, rare conditions, anything that might explain this, when I found a post from eight months ago on some obscure health board. The title was generic: ""Unusual lingual symptoms – seeking similar experiences.""

The post was clinical, almost detached. Hair-like growths emerging from the tongue. Pain upon removal. Metallic taste. Gradual development of visible follicles.

It could have been written by me.

Two replies.

The first dismissed it as hairy tongue syndrome.

The second was a single line:

""Check your DMs.""

The original poster replied once: ""Thank you. I'm not alone.""

I created a throwaway and messaged the original poster. Didn't expect a response, as the account had been inactive for months.

Three hours later, I got a DM.

Not from them.

From someone else.

A subreddit link: r/LingualPilosis.

Private community. I had to request access. They asked for a description of my symptoms, photos if I had them, and how long I'd been experiencing them.

I was approved within four hours.

What I didn't notice until later: *they never asked how I found them.*

There are over two hundred of us.

I've spent six hours reading through posts. Timelines. Symptom progressions. Theories.

Some people have been dealing with this for months. One user, u/Creative-Hurry-8431, has been documenting for three years.

Three years.

The progression charts are meticulous.

Phase 1: Sporadic emergence, 1–3 strands daily, easily dismissed.

Phase 2: Increased frequency, visible follicle development, metallic taste.

Phase 3: Rigid strand formation, connective sensations, follicle clustering.

I'm in Phase 2. Maybe early Phase 3.

No one's posted about a Phase 4.

The photos look like mine. The descriptions match exactly. The same rigid strands. The same pinprick marks. The same nauseating tugging when you pull one free.

No one knows what it is. There are some theories: fungal, parasitic, some kind of novel keratin disorder, a covert government conspiracy (there's always that one person it seems), but no one has gotten a doctor to take them seriously. Most have tried. The strands are too thin, too fragile. By the time you get to an appointment, they've dissolved or dried out or just don't look impressive enough.

Creative-Hurry-8431 has been the most persistent. Sent samples to three labs. Two came back inconclusive, citing ""keratin-like protein structure, origin unknown."" The third never responded.

There's something else I noticed.

Every post is calm. Measured. Clinical.

Even the people who've had this for years write like they're filling out a medical questionnaire.

No one seems scared.

I don't know why that bothers me so much.

There's a video call scheduled for Friday night. Ten of us. We're going to chat compare symptoms in real time, see if we notice patterns the text posts might have missed.

I don't know what I'm hoping for.

I'm going to try to nap now. I'll be sure to post an update after the video call on Friday.",1,1765422154.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

I remember the paper on my kitchen table, the word CANDIDATE glaring up at me. I remember the pen beside it, right where I’d dropped it. I remember washing my hands three times even though there was nothing on them.

I didn’t turn any lights on.

Outside my window, the city went through its normal routine. People argued on sidewalks. A siren in the distance. A couple laughed too loudly as they passed by, drunk, alive and unaware of how easily those two things could separate.

I tried not to think about Eric in the trunk. Whether he was still there. 

You did that, the voice in my head said.

You wrote him into that trunk with your lies.

I pressed my palms into my eyes until colors bloomed behind them.

If I walked away, he would still keep hunting. Prospects, volunteers, whatever he wanted to call them. I wouldn’t stop it.

But now I knew something I hadn’t known before.

I could make it worse.

I could make it happen faster.

Or,

I could try to aim it.

The thought made me want to throw up.

Find someone who deserves it.

Who deserves it?

The drunk who got behind the wheel and drove home? The guy who screams at his girlfriend on the phone and grabs her arm too hard outside a bar? The landlord who ignores the mold in his tenants’ walls? The cop who cuts corners? 

I stood at the window and watched people pass under the streetlight, each of them a file I could open if I wanted to.

For twelve years, I’ve watched people from behind glass, behind lenses, behind legal language. I’ve always been able to tell myself I was neutral and in control.

My phone buzzed.

Unknown:
I’m patient, Alex. But not that patient.

Unknown:
The longer you wait, the more people I look at on my own.

The implication was clear.

Do nothing, and who knows how many end up like Eric.

Act, and at least I could tell myself I’d picked someone who… deserved something.

The word candidate stared up at me from the table.

I picked up the pen.

Outside, on the corner, a man in a suit was yelling into his phone, one hand slicing the air. I’d seen him before, always cutting people off in traffic, always shoving past slower pedestrians. Last week I’d watched him grab a waitress’ wrist when she got his order wrong.

I watched him now, his face twisting, his voice rising, someone on the other end of the line absorbing his words because they had no choice.

I shouldn’t have thought it.

I did anyway.

What about him?

My grip tightened on the pen until it hurt.

The line on the page waited.

CANDIDATE:

I told myself I was just thinking.

Just watching.

Just doing what I always do.

But my hand still moved.

Slowly.

As if someone else were guiding it.

I wrote a name.

And the moment the ink dried, I understood the worst part of all of this.

He hadn’t forced me to.

He’d just given me a reason.

I stared at the word until it blurred. The room felt smaller, like the walls were inching closer one breath at a time. Eventually, I set the pen down and stepped back.

I should have torn it up.

I should have burned it.

Instead, I left it sitting there on the table like evidence at a crime scene.

My phone buzzed again.

This time, it wasn’t Unknown.

Marissa.

For a few seconds, I just watched the screen light up. My thumb hovered over the answer button and didn’t move.

The call went to voicemail.

A notification popped up. One new message.

I told myself not to listen. Not tonight. Not with that paper still drying on the table.

I pressed play anyway.

Her voice came through in a strained whisper, like she was calling from inside a church or a hospital.

“Alex… it’s me. I know you said you’d keep looking into him, I just…”

She took a shaky breath. I could hear something faint in the background. A TV, maybe.

“He’s been different again” she said. “Worse. He left tonight and came back at three in the morning. No laptop. No work bag. He just walked in and..”

She broke off.

“He kissed my forehead and said, ‘Thank you for starting this.’ I don’t know what that means.”

My hand tightened around the phone.

“I asked him what he was talking about” she went on. “He just smiled and said, ‘You made the call. That’s all it ever takes.’”

There was a pause. I heard a soft, distant sound behind her. A melody, maybe. Barely there. My stomach flipped.

“And Alex…” her voice dropped, almost a whimper now, “he was humming again. That same song. The one I told you about at the coffee shop.”

Another pause. Longer this time.

“He said he’s… excited” she whispered. “He hasn’t used that word in days. Not like that. I don’t know what you’ve found, or if you’ve found anything.

Her breathing hitched.

Silence.

When she spoke again, the fear in her voice was no longer just about her husband.

“Please call me back” she said. “I feel like something already started and I missed it.”

The message ended with a soft click.

For a long time, I just stood there in the dark, phone in one hand, the paper on the table in front of me.

I realized my jaw was clenched.

My shoulders were tight.

My throat hurt.

And under all of that, under the ringing in my ears and the pounding in my chest, there was something else.

A sound.

Quiet.

Steady.

Familiar.

It was coming from me.

I was humming.

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, from simple and bitter to excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, primarily because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

I started working for this family about a year and a half ago and it’s my first time being both a nanny & household manager. In my previous nanny families I did a good amount of housework in addition to nannying the children but this family is more intense. The mom of my nanny family has recently quit her job/become a stay at home mom which I have no issue with-we are friendly. However, it seems like no matter what I do/how hard I work I cannot meet the expectations of the parents. When it comes to the kids they have absolutely no complaints and I love the children very much. When it comes to the housework I am struggling more/becoming incredibly burnt out. My duties include keeping all rooms of the house tidy, everybody’s laundry (mom, dad, both kids, towels/sheets/etc), dishes (emptying/loading dishwasher), washing bottles & teethers/toys, organizing & sorting, etc. Basically anything needing to be done around the house I do. The mom & I have monthly check ins because I often request feedback. We recently had a check in that left me feeling pretty discouraged & also in the past six months (especially since mom quit her job) that I don’t want to work a household manager anymore especially because I like working with children/the actual nanny aspect. During our meeting she gave feedback that I am not cleaning fast enough for her liking, she does not like how long it takes me to fold/put away laundry, overall that I just need to be more efficient. She also told me she doesn’t want me to be sitting on the job at all and doesn’t like when I stop what I’m doing to make coffee or anything. I kind of get where she is coming from since they hired me to help but I also just feel like maybe we aren’t the right fit for each other? She also made comments about how she doesn’t like if I come in and seem too tired. She said she wants me at 100% energy all the time. They pay me very well but I am starting to get incredibly burnt out/have become miserable. I feel like they would prefer someone who is more of a housekeeper than both a house manager/nanny? It’s also a little weird to me that neither parent ever does anything around the house-when I am not here on the weekends they don’t do laundry at all and any time I am gone for a period the house falls into a complete mess. I also don’t know if this is normal. I am thinking of going back to working at a daycare (even if it would be a pay cut) because I’m feeling incredibly overwhelmed and like I can’t handle their demands.

1pjmk3q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pjmk3q,"All Crops, All Regions, One Satisfying Floating Island Garden Layout! 🌱","*Expansion info is included. Spoiler tagged for those who haven’t unlocked the packs yet.*

**For anyone who didn’t see my** [**original post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamlightValley/comments/1naci3t/comment/neslhob/?context=3)**:** I’ve been working on a fully expansion‑ready crop layout inspired by all the gorgeous floating island gardens people have been sharing. Now that Wishblossom Ranch has launched, I’ve updated the entire layout to reflect the confirmed crops and region structure.

**Updated Region Layout:**

* **Left Side:** Base Game (23 crops, including Spring Veg‑EGG‑table)
* **Top Right:** Eternity Isle (12 crops)
* **Bottom Right:** Storybook Vale (12 crops)
* **Top Centre:** Wishblossom Ranch (6 crops)
* **Centre:** Wishing Well, Storage, Crafting Table, etc.
* **Bottom Centre:** Open decor space

Everything still has clean pathways, equal plot counts, and a balanced layout that’s easy to navigate and manage.

**Floating Island Details:**

* The island uses a **65×65 grid**
* The **outer edge path** is **single‑wide**
* The **path between each crop type** is **double‑wide**
* The **central cross‑paths** (both horizontal and vertical) are **triple‑wide** for better symmetry.
* The **second photo includes colour‑coded sections** showing **where each seed is purchased**, making it easier to track which biome or region each crop belongs to.

**Plot Details:**

* Each crop section is a **6×6 plot** (36 total spaces)
* If you’re using the **Ancient Gardener**, each plot effectively becomes **35 usable spaces**
* Keep in mind: you can only place **4 Ancient Gardeners per area**
* The **pumpkin patch** is a special **6×14** section, since pumpkins are known to be one of the most profitable crops and benefit from having a larger dedicated area and it maintains an even area.

1pjmjit,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pjmjit/lotus_water_drops/,Lotus Water Drops,"Just wanted to start a discussion and forgive me if you know of a good post about Lotus water drops. I did use the search feature and found a few mentions but couldn’t find a really solid discussion.

I just ordered some and have had my eye on them for a while. They’ll be here in a few days. I’ve tried making my own coffee water a while back with Epsom salt, baking soda, and calcium chloride. That was the BH recipe, but I went back to Third Wave water because it’s just so easy. With TWW I make 6 gallons out of a five gallon packet. So basically I use about 80% of a full packet/gallon of third wave. I like my coffee. I don’t notice much difference of if I use more or less. The packets just happen to be 6.36G so the math is easy to split them into 6 gallon separate packets. If it’s helpful to know, my taste buds aren’t sophisticated enough to tell the difference if I use a lot of TWW or a little. 

Anyways… these lotus drops seem like an extremely interesting way to really tweak recipes different types of coffee, and I’m just curious if anyone else uses them?

If anyone’s tried these, the one concern I have is scale. With TWW I experience absolutely no scale in my kettle. Lotus includes calcium chloride in its recipes, and scale is my nemesis. But it’s going to be super interesting to be able to super easily see if I truly enjoy that taste. Maybe I’ll just get more comfortable with cleaning my kettle often and being careful with my espresso machine.

This one is really diving and digging deeper. I’ve deleted things in all the places I can. I didn’t eat today — finally having broth. I should just crockpot broth at this point.
I am trying to find a battle cry but my voice is lost in the waves.

My body keeps trying to give out in big ways forcing me tske more breaks than normal and hide in the bathroom to hide emotions I cant risk others seeing.

🎶 Battle Cry by Kyler England.

Someone took a glimmer and smashed it to pieces. They pathologized it and displaced anger. So I’ll share it here if I haven’t already; I don’t remember at this point. I am too tired.

The last couple days, I’ve come out of my apartment and gotten into my car, and the horses come whinnying and running to the fence. I don’t know them. But I took time to pet them the other day. I had wanted to give them carrots or apples, but I don’t know if the owner would be upset. I’ve just been looking out for them.

Someone in my trauma group went off about how I shouldn’t feed horses, etc. — which I haven’t. I’ve been cognizant about asking. But it killed the innocence of creatures loving me for some reason. I deleted all my posts in that trauma group after it happened. She turned my joy into something about her, then projected anger-and shamed  me the connection and joy. I am already holding threads rn emotionally.

 It’s the same group I’m trying to exit, but leaving it triggers a trauma bind and sends me sideways. But I think this may have finally tipped the scales.

It sent me into a really bad place. They already don’t like anything that isn’t a meme, toxic positivity imo, and “teaching stuff” — no real connection or “how one feels” posts.

I’ve struggled with this, because it is a trauma center putting out information on trauma, yet it’s only a “support group.”

I have struggled for two days now to recover from my little glimmer of love being smashed, in a vast field of aloneness and lovelessness, that has now engulfed my fragile life.

I am still struggling in very deep ways. I guess I’m somewhat graced that I already work in a hospital with one job, but I can’t speak about what I’m going through internally, alone.

1pjmifn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pjmifn/aita_for_being_completely_done_w_my_husband_and/,AITA for being completely done w my husband and his family?,"I (24F) have been with my husband (27M) for three years, married for one. I’m honestly so upset as I’m typing this it’s hard for me to think straight.

He’s active duty and as such we live a long ways away from any of our family. I’ve made it my goal since getting to our new duty station to prioritize his family as he has a brother with kids and older parents and I don’t have much family to begin with.

Well 2 weeks before thanksgiving his brother (35? M) calls us and wants us to drive to where he is (about 8 hours) and stay for the long weekend. I’m not about last minute plans or staying in other peoples houses but due to other familial concerns I arranged everything as per usual (driving in snow, finances, making it there and back on time, etc.) and we went.

Well his brother conveniently forgets to tell us that they are going over to SOMEONE ELSES house for thanksgiving, people who we’ve never met. Now I’m gonna just preface this by saying, I’m not a weak or whiny person. I can hold my own and take care of myself. But man is his brother a real ass.

Upon my first time meeting me, out in public at a restaurant, he goes out of his way to tell me he only likes to F smaller chicks so he can “bang them up against a wall” - I am plus sized. The first time I ever spoke to this guy on the phone pretty early on in my relationship with my husband, he compared my feelings for his brother to “a dog humping a couch.” There’s a large arc of drama where I spent an entire Christmas alone, my only close family in major surgery, in someone else’s house because it was more important to his brother for my (at the time bf) to be over 1000 miles away and drunk off his rocker for two straight weeks. (I also know this is husband’s fault as well, just have to show what I’m trying to say).

I can go on and on and on. Brother once told us he was coming to stay, so I did all the prep and he flaked last second to go get drunk with his buddies a few towns over (if you can’t tell, he’s a little too fond of alcohol).

Brother once had us do what he called a “fun road trip” but was a 24 hour nightmare where he was hitting himself so hard to try to stay awake that I started crying and begging them to stop the car.

And to top it all off, as if all of this wasn’t bad enough he’s one of the “better than you, coffee bros, uhm actually” types. I don’t like him. I’ve never really liked him. But he’s my husband’s only brother so I’ve tried my best to be a good wife and plan things out and send gifts at Christmas and plan trips, but this has got to be the last straw.

On the drive, brother had called us and was making some distasteful jokes (as per the usual) making sideways comments about “autistic ret*rds” and “touch of the tism” all that crap. Well I am actually autistic, I’ve just never told his side of the family for obvious reasons. I was so fed up I just blurted it out, not mean or anything just matter-of-fact. He doubled down saying “everyone is autistic” and compared me to Chris Chan. No, I’m not joking.

Today he makes a FB post that says how he “forgot to post this picture he took while his brother was visiting.” And it’s the single picture he got of just the two brothers, Conveniently leaving everyone else out, or the fact that I was even there to begin with. I planned the trip. I paid for the trip. I posted his kids on my social media, explaining how I love being an auntie.

So I’m done. I will no longer be the one to remember birthdays, send gifts of any kind, visit for any reason or any length of time. Every single time I do I feel like I spent the entire time getting bullied. I do not care what my husband does, but I can’t put up with it anymore. So, AITA?",5,1765421483.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

	**(Far From Everything)**

  
  


Chris Haddad: Journal Two, Entry One



	I laid in ruins following the aftermath of what was supposed to be a fun outing. My friends all left me, Daniela hated me, and my parents now had a reason to abuse me. I realized that every bad thing that happened to me happened in this town. One hot summer night I decided that enough was enough. I packed two bags and however much cash I could find, and sped off in my car. 

	I was going somewhere, anywhere but here: Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago, the farther the better. By the following weekend, I was four hundred miles west in Knoxville. For a week I went around town trying to find work or a place to live, but instead, I found a new vice: **alcohol**.

	While I was walking around in my search for a job, I met an older man named Jonathan who offered to take me drinking. I remember a night of laughing and throwing up until I woke up and was in bed next to a random woman with no clothes on. It was my first time sleeping with a girl and I didn’t even fucking remember it. It felt like someone had stolen my memory and handed me back my body.

	Eventually, I got to my car, said goodbye to Jonathan, and kept driving west. I didn’t have a plan—just a gas station map with circles around cities I’d heard about in songs. Memphis was the first. I slept in a Walmart parking lot and woke up to the sound of a cart slamming into my bumper. I drank warm beer from a stranger’s trunk and watched a blues band play for six people in a bar that smelled like mold and sweat. A woman twice my age tried to sell me pills. I didn’t buy them, but I thought about it.

In Oklahoma City, I got drunk with a group of college kids who thought I was someone named Caleb. I didn’t correct them. They bought me shots. I crashed on their couch and left before sunrise with someone’s hoodie and none of my dignity. I vomited in a bush outside a church and thought maybe I should pray. But I didn’t know how anymore.

By the time I hit Amarillo, I hadn’t slept in two days. My breath smelled like gas station whiskey and nicotine, and I couldn’t tell if the shaking was from withdrawal or exhaustion. I remember staring at a neon motel sign blinking *“VACANCY”* like it was a lifeline. Instead, I spent the night at a house party with kids younger than me, drinking whatever they handed me and making out with a girl whose name I never asked. I stole a deck of cards from their kitchen drawer for no reason other than it made me feel alive to take something.

In Albuquerque, I woke up in a dry fountain with sand in my mouth and sunburn on half my face. I had piss on my jeans and a flyer for a band called “Eternal Malfunction” in my back pocket. A man offered me meth and I almost said yes. Not because I wanted it—but because I wanted to stop *wanting* anything.

By the time I crossed into California, I didn’t even recognize myself in the rearview mirror. I was sleeping in my car behind a 24-hour diner in Riverside, showing up at random bars with a fake smile and a real thirst. I gambled what little money I had left at house games I barely understood, and every time I lost, I felt like I deserved it.

The scariest part wasn’t the hangovers, or the blackouts, or the strangers whose beds I woke up in. It was how normal it all started to feel. Like I’d finally found a rhythm in the chaos. Like I was meant to be this broken. I had long forgotten about the family I left behind—not because I hated them, but because remembering meant feeling, and feeling would have killed me faster than the bottle ever could.

During another one of my benders, I had half a bottle of tequila and a couple sleeping pills. My vision went blurry, I fell back on the floor. 

I woke up choking on air. My throat was dry, my chest was tight, and my arms felt like they were floating. The ceiling above me buzzed with fluorescent lights so blinding it felt like I was being interrogated. I couldn’t move at first. There were wires taped to my arms, an IV in one hand, and my mouth tasted like chemicals and copper.

Everything was white—the walls, the sheets, the machines. I thought maybe I was dead. Or dreaming. Or both.

Then I turned my head and saw them: Aunt Fatima, Uncle Yousef, Tamer, and Fayrouz. Sitting in plastic hospital chairs with wrinkled faces and plastic water bottles clutched too tightly. Their eyes met mine, and I couldn’t tell which was worse: the concern, or the disappointment.

Fatima looked like she’d aged ten years in a night. Her hands were folded in her lap like she was praying, though her lips never moved. Yousef had his arms crossed, jaw clenched like he was trying to swallow every word he wanted to yell. Tamer avoided my eyes, pretending to scroll through his phone, and Fayrouz just stared—like she was trying to recognize the cousin she hadn’t seen since she was nine.

I wanted to say something. Joke. Apologize. Ask what the hell happened. But the only thing I could get out was a dry, cracked whisper: “What… day is it?”

Fatima stood first. She walked over, brushed the sweat-damp hair off my forehead, and kissed it. Her touch was soft, but her eyes were sharp. “It’s Sunday. You’ve been asleep for almost a day.”

I blinked, trying to piece it together. The bottle. The pills. The concrete floor. The lights spinning overhead. The silence.

“You had a seizure,” Yousef said flatly. “You almost died.”

He didn’t say it to punish me. He said it like a fact. Like reading a line from a newspaper. It stung more than if he’d yelled.

“I didn’t mean to…” I mumbled, not even knowing what I was referring to.

“We know,” Fatima said quickly. “We know, habibi. You’re okay now. You’re safe.”

But I didn’t feel safe. I felt hollowed out. Like I had been scraped raw and filled with shame. Like waking up from a nightmare only to realize the nightmare was still happening—just with softer lighting and heart monitors.

They had come all this way for me. People I barely knew anymore. People who owed me nothing. And still, they showed up.

That realization hit harder than the overdose.



	Even though I never told them about what had been going on at home, they understood that I couldn’t go back home. I slept on their couch for two weeks to detox and clean myself up. The first three days were the worst of it where I vomited all over the living room floor and seized two more times. The shaking and insomnia got better but I grew extremely irritable and aggressive, constantly craving what nearly killed me.

	Uncle Yousef would bring me cigarettes to keep my mind away from the bottle, but I needed something else to distract me. Around then I was writing a lot more music and began to take it more seriously than when I was in high school. Tamer would listen in whenever I played, constantly praising my work and pushing me to release my songs.

	With the money I had from working fast food, I bought a microphone and some recording equipment just to mess around with and make a few demos. Tamer had a friend who could mix and master stuff really well and had her work on eight songs I recorded. Before I knew it, I had a small following on streaming services and was making enough money from it to quit my other job. 

	Fatima and Yousef supported me relentlessly through that time and even managed to get me into therapy and back on my medications. They even organized a little get together with family and friends to celebrate my birthday. I was sober, successful, happy, and loved. Something merely a year before, I wouldn’t have been able to imagine it. I was 21 then. As I sat in front of my cake, watching the flames dance atop the candles, I made my wish.

	*I wished I could stay in this moment forever — clean, warm, and wanted…*

	If only that moment could last forever. Not even an hour later, we had gotten in the car to go to a concert when I felt something bad was gonna happen. Just as we pulled out of our neighborhood, a drunk driver T-boned us and I took all the impact. The car slammed into my left side and we flipped. Time felt slowed as the sky became the ground and then went back. The glass tore through my flesh, my airbags rammed into my skull almost as hard as the other car did. 

As we laid on the asphalt I saw a bone sticking out of my thigh, and there was blood everywhere. I broke my femur, cracked three ribs, and sustained a head injury. We all spent a couple days in the hospital. I was the worst off though.

After several surgeries and X-rays and CAT scans, they let me go home. Even though I was getting better, my ribs still hurt like hell. They prescribed me Oxycontin to help with the pain among other things and sent me back with Fatima and Yousef. The pills not only numbed the physical pain, but all of my trauma and guilt I’d buried too.

Over the following weeks, I stayed on the pills even though the pain was gone. By then, my doctor caught on to me and cut me off. I started buying off the street and lying to my therapist that I was sober. It didn't take long for me to pick up the bottle again, pick up the pipe, reuse syringes, and lose all feeling again. 

The benders became a normal occurrence in that house. Fatima got used to me showing up shit faced at four in the morning, Fayrouz and Tamer stopped talking to me, Yousef barely acknowledged that I still lived in his house. They stopped trying to help me because I was beyond helping. I was too far gone. 

One night, I came home from a friend’s house with eight shots and half a gram of cocaine in my system when Yousef snapped.

“Here you are again. Coming home to a family that has done everything they could to save you, but all you do is get high and cause trouble! I love you like a son, but now you have to choose between the drugs or continuing to live under my roof.” He shouted.

“Fuck you, dude.” I muttered.

“You’ve made your choice. Get out of my house right fucking now, Chris! Grab your shit and leave my family!” Yousef ordered.

“Your family?” I asked.

“My family. We may share the same blood, but you’re no longer a part of this house.” He barked. I was filled with a burning rage not aimed at Yousef or Fatima, but at myself for becoming the person I swore to forget.

	I pushed Yousef into the counter and he slapped me across the face. We threw a few punches before I picked up my half empty bottle of Modelo. It was almost as sweaty as I was at that moment. I swung the bottle behind my shoulder and shattered it over my uncle’s bald head. I saw his gaze shift from self-preservation to pure anger. He grabbed me by the throat and pinned me against the wall. 

All the memories rushed back. My great-grandmother’s last words. Sitting by the highway. My dad’s hands. The way Yousef’s grip felt just like his. The way it felt to look death in the eyes and grin. I flailed around like a fish on the pier, awaiting his slow and agonizing death. My right hand brushed across Fatima’s knife box. I grabbed the closest one and gave no thought to my plan. I swung my arm and the knife sliced through his shoulder. I didn't even mean to stab him that hard. It just went in almost like it was butter.

Yousef howled in pain and dropped me from the wall. We both collapsed onto the floor: him and Fatima holding rags to his wound, and myself catching my breath. I grabbed my keys and drove into the night. Nothing sobers you up like sinking a kitchen knife into the man that took you in when you had nowhere else to go. I drove to the airport and booked the first available flight to Beirut the next morning. 

As the plane took off and I soared through the sunrise, I thought about what I had done. I tried to blame other things: my parents, the drugs, the car crash, but I could find no scapegoat to cover my crimes. I ran away. I got addicted. I stabbed Yousef. I made a bomb threat. I ran. I tried to drown it all in a bottle, but the mirror never blinked. I am the villain in my own story. Though I’ll deny it every day I live, I am my own downfall.

Chris Haddad: Journal Two Entry Three



	When I walked out of the airport into the night, the weight of my decision hit me: I was in a new land with new people, a new culture, a language I barely understand, and no family to disappoint. I brought myself here and I was gonna make the best of it. I caught a taxi from the airport to the city center and booked a hotel room for the next two weeks. In the morning I’d find a job and plan my near future. But for now, I needed to sleep.

	The next day, the withdrawals hit me like a sack of bricks. I threw up constantly, I had a blinding headache, and I was shaking so much that I couldn't hold a glass of water without it spilling everywhere. After five days of this mixed with coffee and cigarettes, I got better. I found a construction job that paid just enough to keep me fed and under a roof.

	I came home every night drenched in sweat and dirt for nickels and dimes to keep me housed. It was a form of torture, a one that I created for myself. Maybe if I carried lumber on my shoulders everyday, I would hurt as much as Yousef did the night I ran away. Maybe if I constantly worked, I wouldn't have time to miss the pills or the bottle. Maybe this would slowly kill me, I was fine with this too. 

	After a few months, I left the city. I sold whatever didn’t fit in my backpack, and walked away from my new life again. I headed east towards the mountains, walking for days—searching for food, shelter, or maybe just a place to die. As I travelled from the sea to the mountains, I slowly began to realize that I was the audience of my own story. The path I was destined to traverse was not decided at the bottom of a bottle, or by my own will; it was conceived in these sands long before I ever set foot on this earth. This land was the devil in my blood. After six days, I stumbled across the mountain village of Douma. I checked into a hotel and slept like I did my first night in Beirut.

	The next morning, I went to a small restaurant for breakfast where my life would change for the better. My waitress was a young woman not much older than me named Layla. She was short, tan-skinned, and beautiful. The second I laid eyes on her, I knew she was the one. Layla was an oasis in the desert to me. I came back to that restaurant nearly every day over the next few months. Not because the food was good, but for Layla. We started talking more and more and eventually, I mustered up the courage to ask her out in my rudimentary Arabic. 

	The next night, I came up to her house and met her family. Her father was an older man named Omar who owned the restaurant Layla worked in, her mother was a woman named Nadia who took care of their kids. Layla also had five younger brothers between the ages of four and nineteen. Her family had lived in that house for many generations, since the Ottomans controlled the region. Layla didn’t want to carry on her family legacy, but wanted to own her own restaurant one day.

	We ate dinner and I walked with Layla around the village, stopping in random cafes and corner stores. We sat at a table on the street next to a kind of ice cream parlor. I told her my life story: how I grew up in an abusive household, ran away at sixteen, and struggled with addiction and mental illness. I expected her to turn away and leave me like everyone else had, but she sat and listened and understood.

	“I’m always here for you, Habibi. I promise.” Layla told me. The last person who ever called me “Habibi” was Fatima: the woman whose husband I assaulted, the woman who always walked me to bed when I was too drunk to stand, the woman who loved me regardless of anything that I did. I sobbed uncontrollably at her words. Not tears of sadness or guilt, but tears of joy. 

	We were married the next winter and started our new lives with each other. Layla found a job as a chef at a restaurant back in Beirut and encouraged me to work on my music and art again. We rented an apartment and had our first child, a boy we named Elias, later that year. For my next birthday, we had our new friends and neighbors over. Layla’s parents and brothers even drove up for the weekend to celebrate with us. This was the first birthday I celebrated since before I ran away.

	Layla lit the candles and everyone sang me happy birthday in English. Elias was sitting on my lap smiling at the small flames dancing above the cake. I was surrounded by family and friends: both new and old. They all knew what my life was like before, they all knew why I left America. Yet they all stood there smiling, singing, loving unconditionally. I blew out the candles without making a wish this time, for I had everything I’d ever wanted. Everyone cheered and we started dancing Dabke. I was twenty-five years old and happy again.

Chris Haddad: Journal Two, Entry Four



	We’d lived in Beirut for three years by then. We lived in the same apartment, Layla still worked at the same restaurant, and I was still the same young and sober father I had always yearned to be. Though we were doing well for ourselves, my new homeland was plunged into political instability further than before.

	As the three of us were driving home from the movies, we were stopped at a checkpoint controlled by Hezbollah. I knew when they asked to see our papers, I was fucked. Though I had dual U.S. and Lebanese citizenship, I was very obviously a foreigner. Not only a foreigner, but an American. They ripped me from the driver’s seat and began beating me relentlessly. I felt every fist, every club, every rifle butt that hit me. It was at that moment we knew it was time to leave Lebanon for good.

	We moved into the apartment above Omar’s restaurant until we could sort out visas and American citizenship for Layla and Elias. I drove an hour and a half into the city and an hour and a half back nearly every day for weeks until their visas were approved. We flew from Beirut to Los Angeles, the exact flight I took five years earlier when I tried to run from my problems but instead found the solution.

	After spending ten days in another hotel room, we found a small house and we both got jobs at a restaurant nearby. The only catch was that we were two blocks away from Fatima and Yousef’s house. After talking it over with Layla, I decided it was time to try and make amends with the only family I’ve ever had. I walked down the street towards the place I used to call home. The closer I got, the more my heart raced, the more I felt the weight of everything I’d done hit me. I nearly killed my Uncle, I became a kind of burden to them that I never wanted to be.

	The last time I stood on that doorstep was when I tried to escape the monster I used to be, the monster still locked inside of me somewhere. I rang the doorbell and waited to see their faces reflect my guilt like a mirror. The footsteps approached and I heard Yousef’s voice. The deep, yet soothing tone rushed into my ears and made me feel so safe. The door swung open and he looked into my eyes. He didn’t say anything, just started. It was a look of fear,  disappointment, and longing all in one.

	“Hello, son.” he said as a tear rolled down his cheek and into his beard. I broke. I hugged him and sobbed a flood of memories both good and bad, of regrets, of guilt, of love for one’s father. Fatima heard us from the kitchen and ran out to see what was happening. She too joined our embrace and the dams in her eyes breached. 

	They invited me in for dinner and we caught up on everything that happened in the last five years. Tamer was getting his masters, Fayrouz was going to graduate high school next semester, Yousef sold his store and Fatima sold blankets online. I told them about Lebanon, and my new family, and the reason why we left. It was almost as if no time had passed and we were back to when I was barely an adult. 

	The next night, Yousef’s family came over for dinner at our place. Elias loved them so much that he called them Grandma and Grandpa. We ate and talked and danced long into the night like old times. Like my birthday back in Beirut. I’ll never leave this place. Layla and I had two twin girls named Amina and Autumn. By the time I was thirty-four, our family owned a little diner called “Aunt Fatima’s.” We used a lot of Omar and Fatima’s dishes and a few of our own that we cooked up over the years. Layla’s family flew out to see us twice a year and things were great. 

Elias’s birthday came up and everyone gathered at Yousef’s house. Even Tamer had come back from school for the weekend to see us. We all gathered around the table where thirteen years before, I had blown out the candles shaped two and one on my own cake. We all sang to Elias and gave him little gifts: everything from toys to new clothes. His little sisters sat by his sides and he blew out his candles with the most powerful winds he could produce from his eight year old lungs. 

Just then, my cell phone rang. It was a number I didn't recognize but it had the same area code as the town I grew up in. Against my better judgement, I answered.

“Hello?” I asked.

“Hey, Chris,” a woman responded. Her voice was old and shaky, like she’d been crying for some time. I heard the voice was new to me yet had a familiar quality that I couldn’t quite put my finger on.

“It’s me, bud.” she said

My heart froze when she called me that little nickname I hadn't heard since I was in high school.

	Becoming an alcoholic before your eighteenth birthday must be brutal. He was picked up by his family and got a lot better until the car accident. I still can’t decide whether I hate or empathize with what Chris did to his uncle. Fleeing the country was obviously his last resort for escaping his addiction and he found his way back to normalcy there.

	Aside from Yousef and maybe Fatima, Layla had the biggest positive impact on Chris’s life so far. Her family took him in as one of their own immediately and she left the only home she’d ever had so that her husband and son would be safer.

1pjmf7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/1pjmf7u/have_i_done_the_right_thing/,Have I done the right thing?,"I apologize right away for the long text. I am 29 years old and a late bloomer (it’s a long story; I mostly worked, helped my family, then fell into depression for 4 years, then gained a lot of weight and didn't feel attractive, so I spent several years losing weight. I only actively started dating in the last 2.5 years, and even then, I’ve only been on 17 dates in total).
I went to a guy’s place for a second date. I liked him; there was chemistry, we were intellectually compatible, we shared a sense of humor, and I was physically attracted to him. He invited me over for dinner the next day. I had never done that before. I lost my virginity last year to a guy I dated for a couple of months, and sex happened once and was very painful. Here, I was in another city, he’s temporarily here from another European country and clearly not looking for a relationship, and I wanted to gain some sexual experience.
But I wanted to have a choice and didn't want him to expect sex, so I said I would only come for dinner. Then sparks flew between us, and I decided to continue. I explained the situation to him, saying I was afraid of pain and asked him to be gentle. He said he would be careful and asked if I was sure, and that we could stop if needed, but I wanted to try.
Having sex was painful, but he was patient, saying it was okay if it didn’t work out. By the way, he was constantly hard; my previous partner could only go once a night, but this guy said he could have sex all night. We slept together 3 times that night; it was painful, but he stopped when it hurt and we took breaks. He comforted me, letting me put my head on his chest. I thought that if I did it more, the pain would pass, but he said I shouldn't have to get used to the pain.
I felt guilty that I was in pain. I wondered if something was wrong with me. I couldn't relax, and I experienced dissociation—my thoughts were somewhere else, not in the moment. We eventually fell asleep. I didn't sleep well, and neither did he, but we hugged in our sleep. He would go to the bathroom, come back, and hug me again.
In the morning, as soon as we woke up, he started kissing my chest and touching me below. The penetration was painful again. He later asked if I wanted to give him a blowjob. I said no, and he said, ""Okay,"" but he had also asked at night, and I had refused. Then I felt guilty that he couldn't penetrate me, but he kept saying, ""It's fine, don't worry."" I tried to give him a handjob, and he said he couldn't finish that way—only sex or a blowjob. I said no, and he suggested anal. I refused. Then he asked if he could cum on my chest.
Honestly, I felt humiliated after that, like I was used... although my friends say it's normal when guys finish on the chest. He then went to shower, said we could have breakfast, and he would walk me to the metro. We discussed why it was painful for me. He said he felt inside that I was tensing up from fear and getting tight. He said it was hard to enter. He said he understood it was difficult for women, especially since I only knew him for the second time, and that coming to his place was ""brave."" He also said that next time, I should ask the guy for his ID, etc.
I was mostly silent or answered briefly. We grabbed coffee to go and walked a little, most of the walk in silence. I felt empty and just wanted to leave quickly. We got to the metro, he kissed me, and we parted ways.
The next day, he texted me, asking, “did you block me? Haha” (because I had deleted him from my contacts, and my profile picture is only visible to contacts, but when he sent the message, the avatar appeared). And then he wrote: “oh I just didn’t see the avatar by the way the exam results came out I passed :)” I replied to him 2.5 hours later, saying something like, ""No, I didn't block you hahaha."" I congratulated him and asked if he was celebrating.
He replied: “insane. oh nvm. i thought its sunda haha."" To the question of why he wasn't celebrating, he answered: “bit tired and just didnt plan anything. if u need a quick schmus u can come over. i`m reeeealll chill today so no big plans for me unfroutunately.”
I found his message about a ""quick schmus"" disrespectful. I was ready for a short-term fling, but not when there's no respect, like I'm just some call girl who should drive an hour to his place after 9 PM for a quick schmus (which implies quick sex) and then leave without even staying the night.
But I'm confused because he acted like a gentleman, was soft with me, and careful—and then this message. I feel used and don't know how to shake this feeling; I don't know what to do with myself. My friends say to use him for sex too, gain experience, but I won't gain experience; I'll gain psychological trauma. I realized that one-night stands and FWB aren't for me; I'm too sensitive for that.",1,1765421230.0,TooAfraidToAsk,3,1.0,False

Hi everyone!

Whispers of Fate merchandise is being sold by many companies so it's often difficult to know where to find things, especially overseas. 

I've put together a guide on where to buy Whispers of Fate merch and what I hope will be an exhaustive list of merchandise. 

Items are listed in categories to make it easy for you to find. There are also photos and links to all pages where you can buy specific items.

Notes:
1) While this is *mostly* complete, there are still a couple of things left to add, e.g. the Puco merchandise and the Cotti Coffee collaboration merchandise. I'll also be adding more private seller options for superbuy and more xiaomang links.

2) I have tried to indicate when something is limited edition, limited time or is sold out. I will try to keep this up to date but if you notice that anything isn't right, please let me know. 

3) There are three main options for buying - Cpop universe, Aliexpress, and Superbuy, in order of most to least pricy. These are listed more generally at the top of the document if you just want to browse directly.

-----

Using Superbuy

Superbuy is a forwarding warehouse that will buy things on your behalf from Chinese sellers and ship them to you. 

Buying directly on Superbuy:

Search directly on superbuy for 水龙吟 or 唐俪辞 to find the items or paste the taobao link into the search bar directly. Then add to your cart and pay.
Be mindful of service fees for certain payment methods!

Using the DIY order option:

For crowdfunded taobao items and xiaomang links you need to use the DIY order under the search and paste the link there. Then fill in the required info and pay. Similar for Xhs links. 

Once your order arrives at the warehouse, you can choose which service you want to use to ship it to yourself, and which items you want shipped together.

A few times this year I have subscribed to LinkedIn Premium. And with that subscription I would have my morning coffee and listen to a LinkedIn Learning session. 

Every couple of days I can finish a course and get a certificate. (Most of the classes I take are an hour or two long.) I noticed that every single time I finished a course and posted the cert to my profile, I would get loads of profile views from executives and recruiters. 

There has to be something to this, right? 

Other than that, I typically stay away from the scrolling feed part of LinkedIn. I use it to make meaningful connections and look for jobs that I can then go look at on the company website.

I was dead broke. Fresh out of high school and struggling to pay for college. My job at the local mall wasn’t cutting it, and time was running out fast for me to cover next semesters tuition. 

During one of my very limited off-days, I had been in the grocery store, picking up a few things to hold me over for the next two weeks. 

As I stood over the frozen meat section, lost in a trance with my mind in a million places at once, I felt a hand on my shoulder. 

“Good morning, sir, how are you doing this morning?” 

I glanced over his uniform. It was too refined and decorated to be that of a recruiter. 

Looking down at my own outfit I realized that I looked, in fact, quite homeless. 

“Ah, you know. Making it through.”

“That’s excellent to hear, sir. Hey, I have a question: have you ever given any thought to the U.S. Military?” 

He asked as if he KNEW my answer, as if he could read it on my face. 

“Listen, man, I’m in college. Barely making it by, but, you know.” 

“Yes sir, I do. Mind if I ask what you’re going to school for?”

I answered honestly by telling him that I was going to be an engineer, to which he replied enthusiastically. 

“Ohhhh, man. The army is begging for some engineers. And guess what? All your schooling paid for. You help us, we help you.” 

I thought about it for a moment. I hated to admit it, but his words were swaying me a bit, and he could sense it. That was a dangerous place to be in. 

Before I got the chance to respond he spoke again. 

“Pays good too.” 

I knew I had to put a stop to this now before he got more of his foot in the door so I responded with a quick, “I’ll think about it,” as I shuffled away. 

As I walked with my back toward him he called out once more. 

“Please do! We’ll be seeing ya.” 

He then seemed to speak into what I assumed was a mic that must’ve been tucked neatly under his collar. I couldn’t make out what he said, just that his face had shifted from approachable to, what can best be described as a look of complete authority as he meandered back towards the entrance of the store. 

I hadn’t thought much of it and continued shopping as usual. 

I had work the next day and as I returned home from an absolutely soul crushing shift, I found that an envelope had been placed in the seam of my doorframe. 

It was marked with a stamp bearing the logo of the United States Army. 

“Damn,” I thought to myself. “They really don’t play about their recruitment.” 

I was about to push my way inside, ready to collapse in bed when my foot landed on yet another sheet of paper. 

“EVICTION NOTICE” in bright red lettering. 

The tape must’ve slipped right off the metal door. 

I don’t know if it was because of my exhausting shift or if my mind had just completely given up, but I simply stepped over the notice and made my way to my bedroom, tossing the envelope on the coffee table. 

I was out before my head even hit the pillow. 

The next morning, I had to fight to get out of bed. Everything seemed hopeless and, I can admit, this is the moment where I had lost faith in myself entirely. 

I remembered the words of the guy from the store. 

Schooling paid for, guaranteed benefits, guaranteed housing, plus a guaranteed job. 

Fuck it. 

I ripped the envelope open and removed its contents anxiously. 

What I read….surprised me. 

This wasn’t a recruitment letter. 

Well, it was. Just not for military recruitment. 

They weren’t asking me for my service, they weren’t even asking me to consider. This letter was to recruit people to test out a new drug that the army had been developing. 

There weren’t many details on the drug itself or its effects. But it DID include that payment for this little trial would be 5 thousand dollars for one day of my time. 

The letter looked official. It was even watermarked with the bald eagle symbol that you see the government use. 

It provided a phone number and urged me to “Call immediately if interested.”

I called and on the third ring, a man picked up. 

I recognized the voice immediately. It was the man from the store. 

“Afternoon, Donavin. I’m assuming you got our letter?” 

“Yeah, I did- wait how do you even know where I live?” 

He responded confidently. 

“It’s our job to know, son. Now, I’m assuming you’re calling because you’re interested in our trial, correct?” 

For a moment, I froze. I’d never even smoked weed before and now they want to give me 5 thousand dollars to try a drug meant for soldiers. Then I remembered the eviction notice, and it were as though my mouth spoke without permission. 

“Absolutely. I’m more than interested.” 

“Excellent, excellent. We’re sending the address over now.” 

Just as the last word escaped his lips my phone chimed with an email notification. 

It was completely blank save for the single address. It didn’t even appear to have a sender. Just an anomalous email amongst the thousands in my mailbox. 

Before I could speak, the line went dead and silenced fill the apartment once more. 

But fuck, FUCK, he hadn’t given me a time. 

“Oh, well,” I thought. “I’ll just go now.” 

Hopping in my car and inputting the address into the maps app on my phone, I found that the location was 2 hours from my home. 

“It’s 5000 dollars, it’s 5000 dollars,” I kept repeating to myself as the car ride dragged on. 

After about 45 minutes, I found that I was in the middle of nowhere and still had 75 minutes to go. 

I drove on, repeating my mantra as I passed trees, fields, and more trees. 

Finally, just on the horizon, surrounded by towering oak trees, was the most secret-government-looking facility I had ever seen. 

It must’ve been 20 stories tall, no windows, a single door directly in the center, and no cars in sight.  

I thought this was probably the strangest detail of all. 

Surely, SOMEONE had to be here besides me. 

This should’ve been the sign that made me turn around and figure things out on my own. I didn’t know just how out of my depth I really was. 

But, of course. “It’s 5000 dollars.” 

I pulled my car into the empty parking lot and started for the door. 

I opened it up and was greeted by darkness. An empty warehouse. I had been duped. 

Duped on an astonishingly professional level, but duped nonetheless. 

However, just as I began to turn and walk away, I could hear footsteps, and row by row the overhead fluorescent lights began to flicker on. 

Walking towards me with a false, corporate smile…was the man from the store. 

“Donavin,” he cheered. “So glad you could make it.” 

I glanced around suspiciously. 

“You the only person here?” 

He responded, almost eagerly:

“I’m the only person you need.” 

As he approached he extended an arm and wrapped it firmly around my shoulders.

“Follow me right this way, young man.”

As we walked a sudden feeling of dread began to come over me. Dread quickly morphed into regret and I attempted to pull away from the man. 

To my dismay, his arm did not budge. He was essentially *dragging* me across the concrete floor as I struggled timidly. 

As he pulled me he just kept…reassuring me? 

“This is what you wanted, you’re evicted, you need this. How are you going to pay for school? I promise, this will all be over soon.” 

The lights continued flickering on as we moved through the warehouse. 

Eventually, the place was illuminated enough to reveal a door that I had not noticed before; and we were headed towards it fast. 

I’m not sure how, but I managed to get my nerves under control. 

Maybe I WAS overreacting. I mean, it’s the military. I’m not selling an organ to someone on the black market or anything like that. I told myself I’d be fine. 

Once we entered the room, I was blinded by the sheer whiteness of everything, so much so that I had to squint my eyes to avoid a headache. 

Right dead in the center of the room, was a steel chair with leather restraints attached to the arm rests. 

I felt the man’s grip on me loosen as he gestured to the chair with his hand. 

“Please, Mr Meeks; have a seat.” 

Cautiously, I sat down and he began strapping my arms down tight. 

“Hey, so, uh, this isn’t really *needed* right? Just a precaution?” 

His lack of an answer concerned me. He just continued tightening the restraints. 

“Oh yeah, when do I get my mon-“ 

The man interrupted. He was no longer turned towards me, but instead was facing a mirror on the wall just to the right of me. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, we have here today: subject 1 for the conduction of the GH75 Trial. As you can see, the subject is restrained and is of no threat to anyone. I ask that you please take notes, and be prepared to discuss what you’ve learned once the trial has concluded.” 

No threat to anyone? What an odd thing to say. 

Amidst my confusion, the mirror seemed to…disappear. What was once mine and the man’s reflection, was now a window. 

On the opposite side sat about a dozen men and women dressed in military uniform, each one studiously looking on, gripping their pads and pens firmly. 

“Just as a precaution,” the man continued. 

On queue, two armed guards with swat shields aggressively entered the room, rifles trained on me. 

“This drug is experimental after all.” 

I knew I had made a mistake. 

Nothing about this was normal, but hell, what was I gonna do now? 

The man finally turned to me once more before whispering to me through a twisted smile: 

“Thank you for your service.” 

Before I knew it, a quick bit of pain radiated from the crease of my right arm. 

He had stuck the needle in and injected me. 

There was no going back now. 

I expected to feel, I don’t know, organ failure or something like that. But, no. Instead, what I felt, was complete and total euphoria. 

Not like heroin, at least I don’t think; more like the strength in my body had been amplified. 

I felt…capable. 

This feeling grew and before I could register anything, I felt MORE than capable. 

I felt…disrespected that they believed these restraints could hold me and my forearm muscles began to tighten and push hard against the leather straps. 

I could see my veins pulsating. They pushed so hard against my skin that they looked as though they were glowing. 

My heart began to beat out of my chest and my brain was pounding. The pain made me angry. So, so angry. 

I couldn’t help but gnash my teeth and struggle violently against the puny restraints. 

I could feel my face radiating with heat and I must’ve looked completely insane judging by the nervous looks on the guards faces. 

“Wipe that fear off your faces, soldiers,” the man screamed. 

“You are marines!” 

The man looked totally in control. This made me even angrier. 

At this point it felt like there was fire beneath my skin begging to be released, and my mouth overflowed with froth. 

My anger was reaching an absolute boiling point and all that I could feel throughout my entire body was pure unbridled rage. 

I could feel the chair shaking as I thrashed and growled like a mad man, and even so, the man remained completely calm. 

I knew I was going to kill him. I knew that there was no way he’d leave this building alive. None of them would leave this building alive. They were all dead and none of them even knew it yet. 

In one final explosive burst of energy the leather restraints snapped and with supernatural speed I had sprung from the chair. 

Both guards opened fire on me immediately, but I wouldn’t go down. I could see their terrified faces, the faces of the people behind the glass, and it fueled me. 

I hobbled towards the guards, against their barrage of gunfire. 

With one swipe of my hand, I ripped the shield from the guard on the right, tearing his arm completely off of his body in the process. 

His partner had begun beating me over the head with his rifle. 

Snatching it from his hand, I heard the shattering sound of each of his fingers that he had wrapped so tightly around the weapon. 

Both guards were screaming now and, God, my GOD WAS IT INFURIATING, 

I forced the barrel of the gun deep into the guards throat. He made a gargled, wet sound, before I pulled the trigger and emptied the rest of his magazine into his stomach. 

He fell to the floor lifeless, leaving his partner alone and critically injured. 

I didn’t need to do anything to him. Enough had already been done. He would die knowing he failed. 

I looked back at the man. 

There it was. 

There was that satisfying look of terror I had been so desperately trying to evoke. 

He fumbled, clumsily, to open the door to get to the other side of the glass window. His trembling made it impossible, however. 

I drew out the moment. Savored every step I took towards him. Every beat of his heart and trickle of his sweat. 

As I stood over him he fell to his knees, like a coward. Begging for his life. 

Tears were rolling down his face as he asked God for forgiveness; asked ME for forgiveness. 

But I was beyond reason. 

The first punch knocked him out cold. I could hear his neck splinter from the second one. But I wasn’t satisfied. 

I drove my fist into his head over and over again. 

I could hear his bladder failing as fluids began to pool around his previously spotless trousers. 

I couldn’t stop. 

Once I hit brain, that’s when the seizing began. 

His thralls were unnatural and sharp. 

Though they had been mostly destroyed, his eyes rolled into his skull and his body looked like it was being lifted off the ground from his midsection as he continued to seize. 

With one final punch, his head cracked open from the front to the back. Brain matter oozed out of the wound and I stared in awe at the bloody mess in front of me. 

In the midst of my rage, I had neglected to feel the void that had opened in my stomach. 

I had never been hungrier. 

My mind told me one thing:

“You know what you want to do…”

Without even a hint of hesitation, I began picking at the brain matter that leaked from the mans destroyed head. 

It started off small, but before I could help it I was shoveling fist fulls of this guys memories directly into my mouth. 

The taste was indescribable. 

I couldn’t stop, period. 

I devoured what was left of his face before moving on to the guards. 

The more I ate, the more I felt the drugs effects kick in. 

I had almost forgotten about the people behind the window. 

They couldn’t have been so lucky. 

The window, the false mirror, it was nothing. It shattered from just one hit and they began trampling over each other trying to leave the room. 

I tore them apart, friends. 

Limb from limb, bite by bite. 

They’re all gone now. 

They’re all mine. 

I exited that warehouse covered from head to toe in their precious lifeblood, carrying with me the vile of the mystery drug that I found in the recruiters coat pocket. 

I could barely contain myself on the drive home. 

And that’s where I am now. 

I’m not concerned with the eviction, school, and certainly not money. 

My mind has been reprogrammed. That’s what the drug does. It’s a violent drug made for soldiers who were meant to die. A last stand drug. 

I have no intentions on dying. 

I have no intentions to stop. 

The only intention that remains in my mind…is simple:

Find more food.

**Philosophy:** This guide prioritizes the **most well-rounded user experience for the effort and cost.

### ---

**Free vs. RealDebrid**

Before choosing your device path, understand the service layer.

#### **Option A: The ""Premium"" Standard (Recommended)**

**Service:** **RealDebrid**

* **Cost:** \~$3-4/month  
* **Benefit:** Instant buffering, 4K remux quality, no reliance on seeders.  
* **Why:** Time is money. For the price of a coffee, you eliminate 99% of streaming headaches.

#### **Option B: The ""Completely Free"" Route**

**Service:** **Torrentio (Free Mode)**

* **Cost:** $0  
* **Benefit:** It works well with few compromises if your internet is strong but sources arent goiung to be as plentiful and reliable.
* **Trade-off:** Relies on P2P peers; older/obscure content might load slower.  


### ---

**📱 Scenario 1: I have an Android Device**

**Includes:** Nvidia Shield, Fire TV Stick, Chromecast with Google TV, Generic Android Boxes, Android Phones, & Tablets.

#### **🏆 The ""Grandpa-Approved"" Premium Choice**

**Recommendation:** **Debrid Stream \+ RealDebrid**

* **Cost:** \~$3/mo (RD) \+ $20/year (Debrid Stream App)  
* **Why:** It offers the most polished, generic ""streaming service"" look. It passes the ""Spouse/Grandpa Test""—if you hand them the remote, they won't get confused.  
* **The ""Killer"" Feature:** **One-Time Web Setup.** You configure everything via a web portal, and it pushes the config to the device. This makes it incredibly maintainable; you can fix settings remotely without touching the device.  
* **The Trade-off:** Unlike Stremio, you are limited to the internal player or a small selection of approved players. You do not have external player freedom. Although as of its latest update the internal player is a very nice solid user experience.

#### **💰 The Budget / Free Choice**

**Recommendation:** **Stremio \+ Torrentio**

* **Cost:** $0 (Free) OR \~$3/mo (with RealDebrid)  
* **Why:** The absolute best free interface available.  
* **Pros:** **Total Player Freedom.** You can use any external player (VLC, MX Player, JustPlayer) you want.  
* **Cons:** UI is slightly less ""premium"" feeling than Debrid Stream, but still excellent.

### ---

**🍎 Scenario 2: I have an Apple Device**

Includes: Apple TV 4K, iPhone, iPad, Mac.  
Note: The Apple ecosystem generally offers superior UI/UX compared to Android.

#### **🏆 The ""Netflix-Style"" Enthusiast Choice**

**Recommendation:** **Fusion or Vidi \+ Infuse (Player) \+ RealDebrid**

* **The Setup:** Use **Fusion** or **Vidi** for browsing/content discovery and **Infuse** as the playback engine.  
* **Why:** These apps blow the Android UI experience ""out of the water"" with beautiful, Apple-native aesthetics.  
* **Preference:** **Fusion** is highly recommended due to active development and the upcoming ""Diffusion"" project (merging library \+ streaming).  
* **Player Note:** Fusion currently lacks a built-in player. **Infuse** is the recommended external player because it handles audio codecs and 4K HDR playback better than anything else.

#### **📚 The ""Library-Focused"" Choice**

**Recommendation:** **Infuse \+ RealDebrid (WebDAV)**

* **The Setup:** Connect RealDebrid directly to Infuse via WebDAV.  
* **Why:** If you prefer a curated library of your own content rather than a ""streaming"" browse feed, Infuse is the king. It parses metadata beautifully and feels native to Apple.

#### **🔄 The Cross-Platform Power Move**

**Recommendation:** **VidHub**

* **Why:** VidHub is Infuse's main competitor, but it has one massive advantage: **Cross-Platform Sync**.  
* If you have an Apple TV in the living room and an Android Tablet or Phone, VidHub will sync your library and watch progress perfectly between them. Infuse is Apple ecosystem only.

### ---

**💻 Scenario 3: I have a PC / Laptop**

#### **For MacBook Users (macOS)**

**Recommendation:** **Fusion or Vidi**

* **Why:** Stremio works on Mac, but its UI is essentially a web wrapper. **Fusion** and **Vidi** offer a far more beautiful, premium, native-feeling interface that matches the quality of the hardware.

#### **For Windows / Linux Users**

**Recommendation:** **Stremio \+ Torrentio**

* **Cost:** Free or Paid (RD)  
* **Why:** On a desktop, you want a mouse-friendly application that just works. Stremio provides a unified interface for tracking, browsing, and playing.

### ---

**💾 Scenario 4: The NAS Setup**

**Target Audience:** Users who own a Synology, QNAP, or Unraid server.

#### **🏆 The Hybrid NAS Setup (rClone Automation)**

**The Concept:** You can have the convenience of a streaming app *and* the permanence of a local NAS library.

1. **Watch:** Use Stremio or Debrid Stream to watch movies.  
2. **Auto-Cache:** Everything you watch is instantly added to your RealDebrid ""cloud"" library.  
3. **The Trick:** Set up **rclone** on your NAS.  
4. **The Result:** rclone detects the new files in your cloud library and **automatically downloads and organizes them** onto your NAS in the background.

**Why this wins:** You don't have to manually manage downloads. You just watch TV, and your NAS builds itself. ""Best of both worlds.""

#### **🏆 The Player**

**Recommendation:** **Infuse** or **VidHub**

* Point these apps at your NAS. They offer superior metadata parsing and require zero file renaming compared to Kodi.

### ---

**Kodi**

**Verdict:** HOT TAKE. **Avoid.** The ""juice is not worth the squeeze.""

#### **The ""Skins"" Reality Check**

Users often claim Kodi can look as good as Netflix. In reality, it is a choice between ugly performance or beautiful crashing.

* **Bingie Skin:** Looks beautiful, but it is a nightmare to set up. **Performance is ass.** Verified on Nvidia Shield: it causes constant crashing issues.  
* **Diggz Xenon Build:** Extremely popular for unknown reasons. The UI is garbage.  
* **Nimbus Skin:** A solid middle ground between UI and performance, but still requires too much effort compared to standalone apps.  
* **The Golden Rule of Kodi:** If the skin performs well, it looks like shit. If it looks good, it runs like shit. It is outperformed in every way by dedicated apps (Stremio/Infuse/Debrid Stream, Fusion, etc). KODI was not built for RealDebrid. It was shoehorned in as an afterthought. It was built for local media.  
* If I set up any type of Kodi build for my grandpa, you will regret it, and grandpa might as well have you on speed dial as the designated Kodi IT guy.

1pjlyiw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pjlyiw,19 y/o with weak enamel + enamel erosion spreading to adjacent teeth — how do I stop progression?,"Hi, I’m 19 and I’ve had ongoing issues with weak enamel. I had professional fluoride treatments around age 15, but they were stopped later on.

Last year, I developed a small smooth “dent” on one of my front teeth where the enamel eroded away and exposed dentin (yellow/brown shade). Recently, I’m noticing the same process starting on the adjacent tooth, and it’s really stressing me out because it seems to be progressing.

At my last dental visit, I was told I have 16 early cavity signs, but no obvious large cavities yet. The dentist said there wasn’t much to do besides monitoring, but I don’t feel comfortable just watching this worsen.

Relevant factors:
	•	History of acid reflux (improved now)
	•	I do drink Coke, currently trying to cut down (now ~2x/month)
	•	I eat acai bowls occasionally
	•	Exam-season coffee drinker — can be daily during those periods, and I tend to sip rather than chug
	•	No major sensitivity yet, but visible enamel thinning and dentin showing
	•	I use fluoride toothpaste and brush regularly

My questions:
	1.	What is the best way to stop or slow enamel erosion at this stage?
	2.	Are bonding, sealants, or infiltration appropriate to protect exposed dentin?
	3.	Should I be using prescription fluoride or hydroxyapatite toothpaste?
	4.	Could reflux still be contributing even if symptoms are mild?
	5.	Is it normal for erosion to spread to neighboring teeth like this?

I’m really trying to prevent further damage while I’m still young and would appreciate any guidance.",1,1765419929.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False
1pjly5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismParentingLevel1/comments/1pjly5z/sleep_problems_any_advice/,"Sleep problems, any advice?","Does anyone have any advice or strategies that helped their Level 1 ASD kiddo sleep better/more? We feel like we’ve tried everything and don’t know what to do. 

My daughter is 4.5yo and recently diagnosed about 2 months ago, but has been having sleep problems for a long time. She slept horribly as a newborn and we ended up sleep training using the Ferber method around 5-6 months. We were able to get her pretty consistently waking up only once per night, which was a huge help. She didn’t sleep through the night until around 13 months. Then we had a decent stretch where she mostly slept through the night for like a year. Ah, those were the days. 

But fast forward and basically the whole time since her toddler bed transition she has slept terribly. We did a sleep study last November because I thought surely there was an underlying issue, but it came back normal. She has a Hatch in her room and we’ve been practicing the ok-to-wake light change for literally almost 2 years, does not help. We have a pretty solid bedtime routine and read books at night. We have tried melatonin, but her problem is not falling asleep it is staying asleep, so this didn’t help. We recently tried Clonidine, which we were sooooo hopeful for because the doctor made it seem like it would be miraculous. She took it for about 4-5 weeks before weaning off of it, because it gave her full on insomnia. I just got her one of the so-called sensory blankets that like wraps around the whole mattress and that did nothing. She likes it okay, but it did not improve her sleep at all. 

She goes to bed between 8 and 9. Wakes up at least once overnight, sometimes around 12-1 and will sleep a little more, or sometimes 3ish and never goes back to sleep. Sometimes she wakes up multiple times. But no matter what, she is up for the day and fully awake by 5am at the latest. We’ve tried adjusting the bedtime to both earlier and later but neither helps. 

She is in pre-k and they still nap, which I think is part of the problem, but they are not allowed to keep them awake. They say the kids don’t have to sleep, they can do quiet time instead, but the teachers aren’t allowed to actively try to keep any kids awake. Fairly often she doesn’t even make it to nap time though, and falls asleep on the rug during circle time or at her table when they are supposed to be coloring or practicing writing letters. 

My husband and I are running on fumes and don’t know what to do. It’s not sustainable for none of us to sleep through the night, especially because we have another kid (2yo) and I have a commute that is over an hour each way. 

So… what helped your Level 1 kid sleep? Anything? We’ve been told once she starts OT that could help so maybeeee but it’s starting to feel hopeless and I don’t really know what an OT could even do.

If you’re going to preach fair labor, maybe start by fairly paying the person who just hiked a half-mile through a cedar-scented fever dream carrying your gluten-free pizza.

I'm following the dosage schedule, sometimes 2.5hrs between doses due to circumstances, but I don't know if I feel a drop in desire to vape yet. Probably not much of a buzz anymore if anything, but I'm still keen for it in between jobs and whilst driving/at home.

It's a busy and stressful time of year for my profession, so I'm working outside in heat for 10hrs a day and an extra 8hrs on the weekend. My sleep had been low last week and my nutrition is struggling a little. Only have one double shot coffee at 6:30am

How can I confront her without being hurtful?,"I go to a hot yoga/ fitness place about six times a week. I became friends with this woman. It started off great. We just bonded over the shared love of fitness and enjoying these classes, we also went for coffee once. We just talked, I learned a lot about her. She was telling me all about her relationship issues and family dynamics and things like that.

However, recently, since going to these classes, she's started saving me a spot beside her every day. This is a yoga studio, so everyone has their mats and they have a little assigned workout area. But like I said she has started to save my spot in class right beside her each time.She's also picking out what weights I'm going to be lifting. She's grabbing all the equipment for me. She sometimes instructs classes so she has the back-end of the booking softwares so she can tell which classes I have registered for. She's also sending me these really long texts about how amazing she thinks I am and how strong she thinks I am and how lovely she thinks I am. While this comes from such a wholesome and sweet place, it's coming off so intense.

I'm not necessarily sure how to confront her about it. It's making me uncomfortable and anxious to go to class, I am so relieved when she is not there. It makes me unhappy honestly when I get texts from her. And I feel bad because I know she's just doing it out of the kindness of her heart, but it's honestly making my uncomfortable.

Another example would be when we were in a cool down, and we were laying in shavasana, (which is a relaxing pose) I had my arms out beside me.And then I just felt her hold my hand and then when I looked over at her, she was staring at me and smiling. All these put together have made me just super super uncomfortable. I don't know how to approach this topic without being hurtful to her.

Part of me thinks that she's a lonely lady. I want to be kind, and I don't want to be rude to her at all, but honestly, it's just a weird situation that i'm in.

Not a complete list (that would be impossible), but a good start:

Bremerton / Gorst area
• 303 Coffee Co (HWY 303) – Drive-thru with a big local following. Creative drinks, friendly baristas, and strong espresso that hits just right on a rainy morning.

Silverdale
• All Star Espresso (Silverdale Way / Myhre area) – Long-running favorite with a big menu, consistent drinks, and “we already know your order” vibes once you become a regular.
• Johnny Coffee (The Trails) – More sit-down café than stand, but excellent coffee, laid-back atmosphere, and a great stop if you want to linger a little.

Port Orchard / Manchester
• Cup of Jo (S Kitsap Blvd) – Drive-thru espresso stand with organic options, breakfast items, and a loyal commuter crowd.
• Cups Espresso – Manchester waterfront – Hot coffee with water views and small-town beachy energy. Paninis too! 
- Gingerbread House on Bay. Always such charming service, always delicious bevvies. Come by for the chai, come back for smiles.

Poulsbo
• Cups Espresso & Café (Front Street) – Downtown coffee spot with espresso, sandwiches, pastries, and cozy vibes before a stroll on the marina or Front Street.

Countywide shoutout
• The Coffee Oasis (multiple locations) – Not a stand, but a Kitsap favorite. Great coffee in café settings across Bremerton, Port Orchard, and more — and your drink helps support local youth programs.

If I had to pick personal faves? 303 Coffee Co for a drive-thru pick-me-up and Cups Manchester when I want that waterfront vibe with my latte.

They had a really bad back injury so on a daily basis I would pick them up and drive them to and from work. We work in b&a school care. 
Before shifts I would go over and we hang out, talk and then go to work. Most evenings we would go out for coffee or a drive or shopping. 

We worked together over the summer time at camp and it was alot of fun. We would still hang out, and if they were ever in a pickle i would help them out. 

Fast forward to this year. They were placed in a different room and me in a different room. The room partner I am currently working with i was having some growing pains with. I would vent to my friend about it, and they would vent to me about their growing pains. 

I started to notice a shift in my friend. It seemed like now they were only calling me when they needed something. Like for me to print something or to use my computer. They also were calling me when they were having back pain again and needed rides. 

When I would help them with grocery shopping they would turn their phone on and start doing tik tok lives and them telling the followers I was their personal taxi driver. I felt insulted. 

I noticed she wasnt really talking to me as much anymore I didnt know why. Then I found out she was starting to spend alot of time with my room partner the one that I would regularly vent to her about. They were going out for breakfast, or dinners or festive activities together then I found out that they were going out and walking and its something ive asked my friend to do with me. I guess I was hurt because when I would ask her if she wanted to hang out she would say ""maybe we'll see"", but then with my room partner they'd go out on a daily basis. 

It weirded me out. I stopped venting to her out of respect to their growing friendship, and when I tried to talk to her about it, she got very defensive saying im not her only friend and she has other people. But then she tried to say I could still vent to her. (I will not vent to her at all anymore because I just feel the trust is gone)

I said of course and I was happy to see her making new connections it just caught me off guard was all, because she just would send me Snapchats of them hanging out. They also stated they felt like all I did was want to go home and spend time with my partner. Ive been very open that hanging out right after morning program does not work for me, and my partner and I are on opposite shifts and I dont get to see them after work. 

I felt like I was being put down for prioritizing my relationship.(their partner cannot leave their house, and shes been open with me about not being happy in the relationship)

I genuinely really do enjoy spending time with my friend, but lately it was feeling one sided and it really did hurt my feelings.

1pjloy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1pjloy0/devconnect_2025_payment_apps/,Devconnect 2025: Payment Apps,"(This is an EVMavericks production.)

During Devconnect 2025 in Buenos Aires, payment apps that bridge stablecoins to Argentina's peso economy were launching, updating, and competing for users. I tested as many of them as I could. Here's what worked, what didn't, and what you should know if you're planning a trip to Argentina with stablecoins in your wallet.

---

**Stablecoin Cards**

I had two debit cards before I started: Metamask and GnosisPay. These worked in most places that accept cards, but were denied a few times.  Generally, if one card was denied, the other was as well, so clearly there is something slightly different about them from the card reader point of view. The most noticeable instance of this was Subte turnstiles, which accept bank-issued cards for subway travel, but rejected both of the stablecoin cards consistently. I didn't dare try the cards on the bus, for fear of the driver kicking me off.

**QR code Payments**

Many merchants, ranging from kiosks to grocery stores to restaurants accept payment via QR code, usually through Mercado Pago or MODO. The QR payment system is regulated by the Central Bank of Argentina under the *Transferencias 3.0* initiative, which requires that all payment service providers and banks use the same standardized QR code generator. There are a number of Web3 apps which plug into this QR scaffolding, making it easy to pay using stablecoins via the apps, as long as you have Internet access.

Usually, the merchant generates a QR code for you at the point of sale. You scan this code in the app and then confirm the transaction. Some smaller shops have a static QR code displayed near the cash register. You scan that for the merchant information and then enter the amount yourself, which then sends a confirmation of the amount paid to the checkout.

Either way, once you confirm, the funds are debited from your account and the merchant receives pesos with a confirmation on their terminal that you paid. It's all very easy and straightforward.

Merchants often reacted with surprise that I, clearly a tourist, was able to pay by QR code, so being able to interact with this system as an outsider is clearly still new. Some merchants only accepted direct transfers and did not have the terminal in order to generate a QR code. None of these apps were able to do a direct transfer in this way.

**P2P(dot)me**

The only payment system that I found which felt aligned to Decentralized Finance (permissionless and trustless within a reputation framework) was P2P(dot)me,  a decentralized bridge between stablecoins and local bank/payment rails.

They match USDC-fiat swaps using smart contracts on Base and a network of ""human liquidity providers"".

At a coffee shop, I entered the cost of my order into the app, where I was matched with an offer taker who wanted to buy my USDC. Then I asked the server for a QR code to pay. I scanned that QR code, which was passed to the taker, who bought my USDC and paid my bill in pesos. It was a little bit slow but well within the tolerances of my coffee shop waitress.

I tried it again in a shop where I didn't know how much the bill would be in advance. Even so, it was just fast enough for me to wait for my offer to be accepted and then scan the QR code before the terminal timed out, needing just a little patience from the shopkeeper.

You are limited to one transaction a day up to a value of $10 USD unless you go through their zero-knowledge KYC to verify yourself as a user. The limit is raised to 10 transactions and a $100 limit if you verify using a social media account (X, Instagram, Facebook, GitHub). If you verify with LinkedIn or ZKpassport, the limit is raised to $200 per day.

I can vouch for the fact that P2P(dot)me worked great in Buenos Aires. It is apparently also popular in India, Brazil and Indonesia.

**Peanut Cash**

The belle of the ball was Peanut Cash, with their hot pink messaging and aggressive social media campaign. Peanut allows you to send/request money from other users and to pay for services using QR codes.

In order to use QR code payments, you have to KYC with an identity document and your residential information. The actual KYC is done by a third-party and varies somewhat by nationality. The payments are handled by Peanut and their banking/payment partners.

Peanut offers perks, up to 20% cashback on specific transactions, based on a tier-based system of referrals and usage.

The Chromium app uses passkeys saved with Apple or Google. You can transfer money out of the wallet that they created on your behalf but there is no way to gain control of it: you cannot access or export the private keys. They claim to be self-custodial, as they don't actually hold the funds and can't seize or spend them. I would call the wallet *not custodial*.

During the conference, Peanut announced that you could now use RedATM cash points to withdraw cash from the app via QR, up to 500,000 pesos, which is much more than bank ATMs using foreign cards. This is a big deal: when I tried to use a debit card at a bank ATM,  I was limited to 30,000 pesos, about twenty dollars, with a seven dollar transaction fee. Peanut Cash with RedATM allows withdrawals of up to 500,000 pesos with a fee of under $5, which was very useful for getting cash quickly.

**Yodl**

Yodl Pay allows you to deposit USDT and pay using QR payment systems in Argentina, Brazil, the Philippines and Vietnam. They also offer Yodl Go for P2P payments among other app users. It is non-KYC with the exception of Argentina.

KYC for using the QR payment system within Argentina was through a third-party and asked for government-issued ID and address information.

The Yodl mobile app is available through Apple Store/Google Play for iOS and Android users.  On first use, the app generates an embedded wallet using Privy, allowing you to bypass Yodl completely and use Privy options to export your keys. I have no idea how to do this and I had to wade through their terms and conditions to even find that information. Instead, I simply withdrew the funds back to my own wallet.

I had no issues paying with Yodl at any merchants who accepted QR payments; my only complaint would be that the app was sometimes slow to load.

**Settle**

Settle is a Farcaster-native wallet that offers crypto-to-crypto payments between users. Settle does not require KYC although obviously you must have a Farcaster account.

They spent the week of the conference onboarding local cafés and restaurants and ended up with about two dozen locations in Buenos Aires by the time I left. The big difference between Settle and the other apps is that there is no conversion: the buyer and the seller are trading in stablecoins, rather than a conversion to pesos at the point of sale.

Rather than cashback, specific locations offered discounts for paying with Settle, similar to existing discounts offered for paying in cash.

I saw a few conference goers speak positively about crypto-adoption in Buenos Aires having seen the Settle signs. So far, they only have about two dozen merchants who accept direct crypto payments via Settle, but I hope the high profile of their merchant onboarding campaign might increase local acceptance of crypto payments.

I didn't test it. Loading Farcaster and then the mini-app within Farcaster made me impatient, but mostly because I never ended up walking into any Settle-enabled locations.

**Takenos**

The Takenos app was aggressively marketed during the final days of the conference with friendly young locals handing out flyers in English and Spanish offering $5 free for immediate sign-up with a referral code. Takenos is a custodial ""global wallet"" that allows you to hold USDC/USDT as well as various fiat (USD/EUR/BRL/ARS). It is aimed at LatAM freelancers and small businesses and available in Spanish only.

Takenos runs on bank/FinTech rails and offers users payment card options along with QR payments within Argentina, with conversion to Argentine pesos happening at the point of sale. There are two cards available, a ""Spicy Card"" for payments in Argentina and a US-issued ""Take Card"" for use abroad and online in foreign currencies.

KYC is required. I went through the KYC requirements to be told three days later that my application was unsuccessful. I have a particular dislike for protocols that use KYC as an invisible application process for their supposedly permissionless service. If there are requirements, they should be made known before KYC.

I emailed their support for comment. I did not receive a reply.

Buenos Aires felt closer to crypto-native payments than anywhere else I've been. The solutions weren't perfect but they worked. Scan a code, send some stablecoins, walk away with an empanada.

I'm currently visiting in the US, where the guy at the Walmart checkout laughed when I pulled out my phone to pay. No, they can't do contactless yet—do I have a physical card?

I wouldn't wish the financial insecurity of Argentina on anyone, but I find myself missing these apps, especially the excitement of watching them grow and add features almost every day. ",4,1765419181.0,ethereum,1,1.0,False

He owns a law firm, he works quite often. He leaves early so I have a lot of open mornings, normally leaves at 5.

 Our plan was to have babies by now, but I got diagnosed with severe PMDD back in may and my treatment is birth control, so babies have obviously been pushed back.

One of the pieces of advice I was given was to find a hobby that is for me.

I considered a part time job but my man doesn’t think that’s a good idea so not looking for that suggestion.

I’ve been seeing a therapist and she said most of things i described doing revolved around him.. like I like to bake, cook, clean. She said everytime she asks about me, I answer with something related to him so she suggested I find something for me and I have tried but I can’t find anything

Also, I love the hair salon/beauty services already, she said it didn’t count because in the end it’s not for me which I disagree completely, but I want to atleast try and follow what she’s saying …so not looking for any suggestions like that!

I’m just looking for something I can do quietly, at home or at a coffee shop even.

It just has to be simple because I’m not smart at all. I tried crocheting and got very frustrated and gave up🫠

I also tried reading books but I never focused long enough to finish one lol

Does anyone have suggestions on something I can do that’s easy, but fun? I love artsy stuff, fashion, makeup. I love movies but I don’t think I’d go see them alone

We live in Beverly Hills so if you’re nearby and even have a class or group suggestion? I can do anything between 5am-430pm. I can’t technically do evenings if I have to, only saying that because I have to make dinner haha

I know this is a tough thing to answer so feel free to ignore it, I just thought I’d try 

Should also include, I don’t have many friends so stuff to do alone is best!",1,1765419161.0,findapath,4,1.0,False

I was dead broke. Fresh out of high school and struggling to pay for college. My job at the local mall wasn’t cutting it, and time was running out fast for me to cover next semesters tuition. 

During one of my very limited off-days, I had been in the grocery store, picking up a few things to hold me over for the next two weeks. 

As I stood over the frozen meat section, lost in a trance with my mind in a million places at once, I felt a hand on my shoulder. 

“Good morning, sir, how are you doing this morning?” 

I glanced over his uniform. It was too refined and decorated to be that of a recruiter. 

Looking down at my own outfit I realized that I looked, in fact, quite homeless. 

“Ah, you know. Making it through.”

“That’s excellent to hear, sir. Hey, I have a question: have you ever given any thought to the U.S. Military?” 

He asked as if he KNEW my answer, as if he could read it on my face. 

“Listen, man, I’m in college. Barely making it by, but, you know.” 

“Yes sir, I do. Mind if I ask what you’re going to school for?”

I answered honestly by telling him that I was going to be an engineer, to which he replied enthusiastically. 

“Ohhhh, man. The army is begging for some engineers. And guess what? All your schooling paid for. You help us, we help you.” 

I thought about it for a moment. I hated to admit it, but his words were swaying me a bit, and he could sense it. That was a dangerous place to be in. 

Before I got the chance to respond he spoke again. 

“Pays good too.” 

I knew I had to put a stop to this now before he got more of his foot in the door so I responded with a quick, “I’ll think about it,” as I shuffled away. 

As I walked with my back toward him he called out once more. 

“Please do! We’ll be seeing ya.” 

He then seemed to speak into what I assumed was a mic that must’ve been tucked neatly under his collar. I couldn’t make out what he said, just that his face had shifted from approachable to, what can best be described as a look of complete authority as he meandered back towards the entrance of the store. 

I hadn’t thought much of it and continued shopping as usual. 

I had work the next day and as I returned home from an absolutely soul crushing shift, I found that an envelope had been placed in the seam of my doorframe. 

It was marked with a stamp bearing the logo of the United States Army. 

“Damn,” I thought to myself. “They really don’t play about their recruitment.” 

I was about to push my way inside, ready to collapse in bed when my foot landed on yet another sheet of paper. 

“EVICTION NOTICE” in bright red lettering. 

The tape must’ve slipped right off the metal door. 

I don’t know if it was because of my exhausting shift or if my mind had just completely given up, but I simply stepped over the notice and made my way to my bedroom, tossing the envelope on the coffee table. 

I was out before my head even hit the pillow. 

The next morning, I had to fight to get out of bed. Everything seemed hopeless and, I can admit, this is the moment where I had lost faith in myself entirely. 

I remembered the words of the guy from the store. 

Schooling paid for, guaranteed benefits, guaranteed housing, plus a guaranteed job. 

Fuck it. 

I ripped the envelope open and removed its contents anxiously. 

What I read….surprised me. 

This wasn’t a recruitment letter. 

Well, it was. Just not for military recruitment. 

They weren’t asking me for my service, they weren’t even asking me to consider. This letter was to recruit people to test out a new drug that the army had been developing. 

There weren’t many details on the drug itself or its effects. But it DID include that payment for this little trial would be 5 thousand dollars for one day of my time. 

The letter looked official. It was even watermarked with the bald eagle symbol that you see the government use. 

It provided a phone number and urged me to “Call immediately if interested.”

I called and on the third ring, a man picked up. 

I recognized the voice immediately. It was the man from the store. 

“Afternoon, Donavin. I’m assuming you got our letter?” 

“Yeah, I did- wait how do you even know where I live?” 

He responded confidently. 

“It’s our job to know, son. Now, I’m assuming you’re calling because you’re interested in our trial, correct?” 

For a moment, I froze. I’d never even smoked weed before and now they want to give me 5 thousand dollars to try a drug meant for soldiers. Then I remembered the eviction notice, and it were as though my mouth spoke without permission. 

“Absolutely. I’m more than interested.” 

“Excellent, excellent. We’re sending the address over now.” 

Just as the last word escaped his lips my phone chimed with an email notification. 

It was completely blank save for the single address. It didn’t even appear to have a sender. Just an anomalous email amongst the thousands in my mailbox. 

Before I could speak, the line went dead and silenced fill the apartment once more. 

But fuck, FUCK, he hadn’t given me a time. 

“Oh, well,” I thought. “I’ll just go now.” 

Hopping in my car and inputting the address into the maps app on my phone, I found that the location was 2 hours from my home. 

“It’s 5000 dollars, it’s 5000 dollars,” I kept repeating to myself as the car ride dragged on. 

After about 45 minutes, I found that I was in the middle of nowhere and still had 75 minutes to go. 

I drove on, repeating my mantra as I passed trees, fields, and more trees. 

Finally, just on the horizon, surrounded by towering oak trees, was the most secret-government-looking facility I had ever seen. 

It must’ve been 20 stories tall, no windows, a single door directly in the center, and no cars in sight.  

I thought this was probably the strangest detail of all. 

Surely, SOMEONE had to be here besides me. 

This should’ve been the sign that made me turn around and figure things out on my own. I didn’t know just how out of my depth I really was. 

But, of course. “It’s 5000 dollars.” 

I pulled my car into the empty parking lot and started for the door. 

I opened it up and was greeted by darkness. An empty warehouse. I had been duped. 

Duped on an astonishingly professional level, but duped nonetheless. 

However, just as I began to turn and walk away, I could hear footsteps, and row by row the overhead fluorescent lights began to flicker on. 

Walking towards me with a false, corporate smile…was the man from the store. 

“Donavin,” he cheered. “So glad you could make it.” 

I glanced around suspiciously. 

“You the only person here?” 

He responded, almost eagerly:

“I’m the only person you need.” 

As he approached he extended an arm and wrapped it firmly around my shoulders.

“Follow me right this way, young man.”

As we walked a sudden feeling of dread began to come over me. Dread quickly morphed into regret and I attempted to pull away from the man. 

To my dismay, his arm did not budge. He was essentially *dragging* me across the concrete floor as I struggled timidly. 

As he pulled me he just kept…reassuring me? 

“This is what you wanted, you’re evicted, you need this. How are you going to pay for school? I promise, this will all be over soon.” 

The lights continued flickering on as we moved through the warehouse. 

Eventually, the place was illuminated enough to reveal a door that I had not noticed before; and we were headed towards it fast. 

I’m not sure how, but I managed to get my nerves under control. 

Maybe I WAS overreacting. I mean, it’s the military. I’m not selling an organ to someone on the black market or anything like that. I told myself I’d be fine. 

Once we entered the room, I was blinded by the sheer whiteness of everything, so much so that I had to squint my eyes to avoid a headache. 

Right dead in the center of the room, was a steel chair with leather restraints attached to the arm rests. 

I felt the man’s grip on me loosen as he gestured to the chair with his hand. 

“Please, Mr Meeks; have a seat.” 

Cautiously, I sat down and he began strapping my arms down tight. 

“Hey, so, uh, this isn’t really *needed* right? Just a precaution?” 

His lack of an answer concerned me. He just continued tightening the restraints. 

“Oh yeah, when do I get my mon-“ 

The man interrupted. He was no longer turned towards me, but instead was facing a mirror on the wall just to the right of me. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, we have here today: subject 1 for the conduction of the GH75 Trial. As you can see, the subject is restrained and is of no threat to anyone. I ask that you please take notes, and be prepared to discuss what you’ve learned once the trial has concluded.” 

No threat to anyone? What an odd thing to say. 

Amidst my confusion, the mirror seemed to…disappear. What was once mine and the man’s reflection, was now a window. 

On the opposite side sat about a dozen men and women dressed in military uniform, each one studiously looking on, gripping their pads and pens firmly. 

“Just as a precaution,” the man continued. 

On queue, two armed guards with swat shields aggressively entered the room, rifles trained on me. 

“This drug is experimental after all.” 

I knew I had made a mistake. 

Nothing about this was normal, but hell, what was I gonna do now? 

The man finally turned to me once more before whispering to me through a twisted smile: 

“Thank you for your service.” 

Before I knew it, a quick bit of pain radiated from the crease of my right arm. 

He had stuck the needle in and injected me. 

There was no going back now. 

I expected to feel, I don’t know, organ failure or something like that. But, no. Instead, what I felt, was complete and total euphoria. 

Not like heroin, at least I don’t think; more like the strength in my body had been amplified. 

I felt…capable. 

This feeling grew and before I could register anything, I felt MORE than capable. 

I felt…disrespected that they believed these restraints could hold me and my forearm muscles began to tighten and push hard against the leather straps. 

I could see my veins pulsating. They pushed so hard against my skin that they looked as though they were glowing. 

My heart began to beat out of my chest and my brain was pounding. The pain made me angry. So, so angry. 

I couldn’t help but gnash my teeth and struggle violently against the puny restraints. 

I could feel my face radiating with heat and I must’ve looked completely insane judging by the nervous looks on the guards faces. 

“Wipe that fear off your faces, soldiers,” the man screamed. 

“You are marines!” 

The man looked totally in control. This made me even angrier. 

At this point it felt like there was fire beneath my skin begging to be released, and my mouth overflowed with froth. 

My anger was reaching an absolute boiling point and all that I could feel throughout my entire body was pure unbridled rage. 

I could feel the chair shaking as I thrashed and growled like a mad man, and even so, the man remained completely calm. 

I knew I was going to kill him. I knew that there was no way he’d leave this building alive. None of them would leave this building alive. They were all dead and none of them even knew it yet. 

In one final explosive burst of energy the leather restraints snapped and with supernatural speed I had sprung from the chair. 

Both guards opened fire on me immediately, but I wouldn’t go down. I could see their terrified faces, the faces of the people behind the glass, and it fueled me. 

I hobbled towards the guards, against their barrage of gunfire. 

With one swipe of my hand, I ripped the shield from the guard on the right, tearing his arm completely off of his body in the process. 

His partner had begun beating me over the head with his rifle. 

Snatching it from his hand, I heard the shattering sound of each of his fingers that he had wrapped so tightly around the weapon. 

Both guards were screaming now and, God, my GOD WAS IT INFURIATING, 

I forced the barrel of the gun deep into the guards throat. He made a gargled, wet sound, before I pulled the trigger and emptied the rest of his magazine into his stomach. 

He fell to the floor lifeless, leaving his partner alone and critically injured. 

I didn’t need to do anything to him. Enough had already been done. He would die knowing he failed. 

I looked back at the man. 

There it was. 

There was that satisfying look of terror I had been so desperately trying to evoke. 

He fumbled, clumsily, to open the door to get to the other side of the glass window. His trembling made it impossible, however. 

I drew out the moment. Savored every step I took towards him. Every beat of his heart and trickle of his sweat. 

As I stood over him he fell to his knees, like a coward. Begging for his life. 

Tears were rolling down his face as he asked God for forgiveness; asked ME for forgiveness. 

But I was beyond reason. 

The first punch knocked him out cold. I could hear his neck splinter from the second one. But I wasn’t satisfied. 

I drove my fist into his head over and over again. 

I could hear his bladder failing as fluids began to pool around his previously spotless trousers. 

I couldn’t stop. 

Once I hit brain, that’s when the seizing began. 

His thralls were unnatural and sharp. 

Though they had been mostly destroyed, his eyes rolled into his skull and his body looked like it was being lifted off the ground from his midsection as he continued to seize. 

With one final punch, his head cracked open from the front to the back. Brain matter oozed out of the wound and I stared in awe at the bloody mess in front of me. 

In the midst of my rage, I had neglected to feel the void that had opened in my stomach. 

I had never been hungrier. 

My mind told me one thing:

“You know what you want to do…”

Without even a hint of hesitation, I began picking at the brain matter that leaked from the mans destroyed head. 

It started off small, but before I could help it I was shoveling fist fulls of this guys memories directly into my mouth. 

The taste was indescribable. 

I couldn’t stop, period. 

I devoured what was left of his face before moving on to the guards. 

The more I ate, the more I felt the drugs effects kick in. 

I had almost forgotten about the people behind the window. 

They couldn’t have been so lucky. 

The window, the false mirror, it was nothing. It shattered from just one hit and they began trampling over each other trying to leave the room. 

I tore them apart, friends. 

Limb from limb, bite by bite. 

They’re all gone now. 

They’re all mine. 

I exited that warehouse covered from head to toe in their precious lifeblood, carrying with me the vile of the mystery drug that I found in the recruiters coat pocket. 

I could barely contain myself on the drive home. 

And that’s where I am now. 

I’m not concerned with the eviction, school, and certainly not money. 

My mind has been reprogrammed. That’s what the drug does. It’s a violent drug made for soldiers who were meant to die. A last stand drug. 

I have no intentions on dying. 

I have no intentions to stop. 

The only intention that remains in my mind…is simple:

Find more food.

My anger was reaching an absolute boiling point and all that I could feel throughout my entire body was pure unbridled rage. 

I could feel the chair shaking as I thrashed and growled like a mad man, and even so, the man remained completely calm. 

I knew I was going to kill him. I knew that there was no way he’d leave this building alive. None of them would leave this building alive. They were all dead and none of them even knew it yet. 

In one final explosive burst of energy the leather restraints snapped and with supernatural speed I had sprung from the chair. 

Both guards opened fire on me immediately, but I wouldn’t go down. I could see their terrified faces, the faces of the people behind the glass, and it fueled me. 

I hobbled towards the guards, against their barrage of gunfire. 

With one swipe of my hand, I ripped the shield from the guard on the right, tearing his arm completely off of his body in the process. 

His partner had begun beating me over the head with his rifle. 

Snatching it from his hand, I heard the shattering sound of each of his fingers that he had wrapped so tightly around the weapon. 

Both guards were screaming now and, God, my GOD WAS IT INFURIATING, 

I forced the barrel of the gun deep into the guards throat. He made a gargled, wet sound, before I pulled the trigger and emptied the rest of his magazine into his stomach. 

He fell to the floor lifeless, leaving his partner alone and critically injured. 

I didn’t need to do anything to him. Enough had already been done. He would die knowing he failed. 

I looked back at the man. 

There it was. 

There was that satisfying look of terror I had been so desperately trying to evoke. 

He fumbled, clumsily, to open the door to get to the other side of the glass window. His trembling made it impossible, however. 

I drew out the moment. Savored every step I took towards him. Every beat of his heart and trickle of his sweat. 

As I stood over him he fell to his knees, like a coward. Begging for his life. 

Tears were rolling down his face as he asked God for forgiveness; asked ME for forgiveness. 

But I was beyond reason. 

The first punch knocked him out cold. I could hear his neck splinter from the second one. But I wasn’t satisfied. 

I drove my fist into his head over and over again. 

I could hear his bladder failing as fluids began to pool around his previously spotless trousers. 

I couldn’t stop. 

Once I hit brain, that’s when the seizing began. 

His thralls were unnatural and sharp. 

Though they had been mostly destroyed, his eyes rolled into his skull and his body looked like it was being lifted off the ground from his midsection as he continued to seize. 

With one final punch, his head cracked open from the front to the back. Brain matter oozed out of the wound and I stared in awe at the bloody mess in front of me. 

In the midst of my rage, I had neglected to feel the void that had opened in my stomach. 

I had never been hungrier. 

My mind told me one thing:

“You know what you want to do…”

Without even a hint of hesitation, I began picking at the brain matter that leaked from the mans destroyed head. 

It started off small, but before I could help it I was shoveling fist fulls of this guys memories directly into my mouth. 

The taste was indescribable. 

I couldn’t stop, period. 

I devoured what was left of his face before moving on to the guards. 

The more I ate, the more I felt the drugs effects kick in. 

I had almost forgotten about the people behind the window. 

They couldn’t have been so lucky. 

The window, the false mirror, it was nothing. It shattered from just one hit and they began trampling over each other trying to leave the room. 

I tore them apart, friends. 

Limb from limb, bite by bite. 

They’re all gone now. 

They’re all mine. 

I exited that warehouse covered from head to toe in their precious lifeblood, carrying with me the vile of the mystery drug that I found in the recruiters coat pocket. 

I could barely contain myself on the drive home. 

And that’s where I am now. 

I’m not concerned with the eviction, school, and certainly not money. 

My mind has been reprogrammed. That’s what the drug does. It’s a violent drug made for soldiers who were meant to die. A last stand drug. 

I have no intentions on dying. 

I have no intentions to stop. 

The only intention that remains in my mind…is simple:

Find more food.

I was dead broke. Fresh out of high school and struggling to pay for college. My job at the local mall wasn’t cutting it, and time was running out fast for me to cover next semesters tuition. 

During one of my very limited off-days, I had been in the grocery store, picking up a few things to hold me over for the next two weeks. 

As I stood over the frozen meat section, lost in a trance with my mind in a million places at once, I felt a hand on my shoulder. 

“Good morning, sir, how are you doing this morning?” 

I glanced over his uniform. It was too refined and decorated to be that of a recruiter. 

Looking down at my own outfit I realized that I looked, in fact, quite homeless. 

“Ah, you know. Making it through.”

“That’s excellent to hear, sir. Hey, I have a question: have you ever given any thought to the U.S. Military?” 

He asked as if he KNEW my answer, as if he could read it on my face. 

“Listen, man, I’m in college. Barely making it by, but, you know.” 

“Yes sir, I do. Mind if I ask what you’re going to school for?”

I answered honestly by telling him that I was going to be an engineer, to which he replied enthusiastically. 

“Ohhhh, man. The army is begging for some engineers. And guess what? All your schooling paid for. You help us, we help you.” 

I thought about it for a moment. I hated to admit it, but his words were swaying me a bit, and he could sense it. That was a dangerous place to be in. 

Before I got the chance to respond he spoke again. 

“Pays good too.” 

I knew I had to put a stop to this now before he got more of his foot in the door so I responded with a quick, “I’ll think about it,” as I shuffled away. 

As I walked with my back toward him he called out once more. 

“Please do! We’ll be seeing ya.” 

He then seemed to speak into what I assumed was a mic that must’ve been tucked neatly under his collar. I couldn’t make out what he said, just that his face had shifted from approachable to, what can best be described as a look of complete authority as he meandered back towards the entrance of the store. 

I hadn’t thought much of it and continued shopping as usual. 

I had work the next day and as I returned home from an absolutely soul crushing shift, I found that an envelope had been placed in the seam of my doorframe. 

It was marked with a stamp bearing the logo of the United States Army. 

“Damn,” I thought to myself. “They really don’t play about their recruitment.” 

I was about to push my way inside, ready to collapse in bed when my foot landed on yet another sheet of paper. 

“EVICTION NOTICE” in bright red lettering. 

The tape must’ve slipped right off the metal door. 

I don’t know if it was because of my exhausting shift or if my mind had just completely given up, but I simply stepped over the notice and made my way to my bedroom, tossing the envelope on the coffee table. 

I was out before my head even hit the pillow. 

The next morning, I had to fight to get out of bed. Everything seemed hopeless and, I can admit, this is the moment where I had lost faith in myself entirely. 

I remembered the words of the guy from the store. 

Schooling paid for, guaranteed benefits, guaranteed housing, plus a guaranteed job. 

Fuck it. 

I ripped the envelope open and removed its contents anxiously. 

What I read….surprised me. 

This wasn’t a recruitment letter. 

Well, it was. Just not for military recruitment. 

They weren’t asking me for my service, they weren’t even asking me to consider. This letter was to recruit people to test out a new drug that the army had been developing. 

There weren’t many details on the drug itself or its effects. But it DID include that payment for this little trial would be 5 thousand dollars for one day of my time. 

The letter looked official. It was even watermarked with the bald eagle symbol that you see the government use. 

It provided a phone number and urged me to “Call immediately if interested.”

I called and on the third ring, a man picked up. 

I recognized the voice immediately. It was the man from the store. 

“Afternoon, Donavin. I’m assuming you got our letter?” 

“Yeah, I did- wait how do you even know where I live?” 

He responded confidently. 

“It’s our job to know, son. Now, I’m assuming you’re calling because you’re interested in our trial, correct?” 

For a moment, I froze. I’d never even smoked weed before and now they want to give me 5 thousand dollars to try a drug meant for soldiers. Then I remembered the eviction notice, and it were as though my mouth spoke without permission. 

“Absolutely. I’m more than interested.” 

“Excellent, excellent. We’re sending the address over now.” 

Just as the last word escaped his lips my phone chimed with an email notification. 

It was completely blank save for the single address. It didn’t even appear to have a sender. Just an anomalous email amongst the thousands in my mailbox. 

Before I could speak, the line went dead and silenced fill the apartment once more. 

But fuck, FUCK, he hadn’t given me a time. 

“Oh, well,” I thought. “I’ll just go now.” 

Hopping in my car and inputting the address into the maps app on my phone, I found that the location was 2 hours from my home. 

“It’s 5000 dollars, it’s 5000 dollars,” I kept repeating to myself as the car ride dragged on. 

After about 45 minutes, I found that I was in the middle of nowhere and still had 75 minutes to go. 

I drove on, repeating my mantra as I passed trees, fields, and more trees. 

Finally, just on the horizon, surrounded by towering oak trees, was the most secret-government-looking facility I had ever seen. 

It must’ve been 20 stories tall, no windows, a single door directly in the center, and no cars in sight.  

I thought this was probably the strangest detail of all. 

Surely, SOMEONE had to be here besides me. 

This should’ve been the sign that made me turn around and figure things out on my own. I didn’t know just how out of my depth I really was. 

But, of course. “It’s 5000 dollars.” 

I pulled my car into the empty parking lot and started for the door. 

I opened it up and was greeted by darkness. An empty warehouse. I had been duped. 

Duped on an astonishingly professional level, but duped nonetheless. 

However, just as I began to turn and walk away, I could hear footsteps, and row by row the overhead fluorescent lights began to flicker on. 

Walking towards me with a false, corporate smile…was the man from the store. 

“Donavin,” he cheered. “So glad you could make it.” 

I glanced around suspiciously. 

“You the only person here?” 

He responded, almost eagerly:

“I’m the only person you need.” 

As he approached he extended an arm and wrapped it firmly around my shoulders.

“Follow me right this way, young man.”

As we walked a sudden feeling of dread began to come over me. Dread quickly morphed into regret and I attempted to pull away from the man. 

To my dismay, his arm did not budge. He was essentially *dragging* me across the concrete floor as I struggled timidly. 

As he pulled me he just kept…reassuring me? 

“This is what you wanted, you’re evicted, you need this. How are you going to pay for school? I promise, this will all be over soon.” 

The lights continued flickering on as we moved through the warehouse. 

Eventually, the place was illuminated enough to reveal a door that I had not noticed before; and we were headed towards it fast. 

I’m not sure how, but I managed to get my nerves under control. 

Maybe I WAS overreacting. I mean, it’s the military. I’m not selling an organ to someone on the black market or anything like that. I told myself I’d be fine. 

Once we entered the room, I was blinded by the sheer whiteness of everything, so much so that I had to squint my eyes to avoid a headache. 

Right dead in the center of the room, was a steel chair with leather restraints attached to the arm rests. 

I felt the man’s grip on me loosen as he gestured to the chair with his hand. 

“Please, Mr Meeks; have a seat.” 

Cautiously, I sat down and he began strapping my arms down tight. 

“Hey, so, uh, this isn’t really *needed* right? Just a precaution?” 

His lack of an answer concerned me. He just continued tightening the restraints. 

“Oh yeah, when do I get my mon-“ 

The man interrupted. He was no longer turned towards me, but instead was facing a mirror on the wall just to the right of me. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, we have here today: subject 1 for the conduction of the GH75 Trial. As you can see, the subject is restrained and is of no threat to anyone. I ask that you please take notes, and be prepared to discuss what you’ve learned once the trial has concluded.” 

No threat to anyone? What an odd thing to say. 

Amidst my confusion, the mirror seemed to…disappear. What was once mine and the man’s reflection, was now a window. 

On the opposite side sat about a dozen men and women dressed in military uniform, each one studiously looking on, gripping their pads and pens firmly. 

“Just as a precaution,” the man continued. 

On queue, two armed guards with swat shields aggressively entered the room, rifles trained on me. 

“This drug is experimental after all.” 

I knew I had made a mistake. 

Nothing about this was normal, but hell, what was I gonna do now? 

The man finally turned to me once more before whispering to me through a twisted smile: 

“Thank you for your service.” 

Before I knew it, a quick bit of pain radiated from the crease of my right arm. 

He had stuck the needle in and injected me. 

There was no going back now. 

I expected to feel, I don’t know, organ failure or something like that. But, no. Instead, what I felt, was complete and total euphoria. 

Not like heroin, at least I don’t think; more like the strength in my body had been amplified. 

I felt…capable. 

This feeling grew and before I could register anything, I felt MORE than capable. 

I felt…disrespected that they believed these restraints could hold me and my forearm muscles began to tighten and push hard against the leather straps. 

I could see my veins pulsating. They pushed so hard against my skin that they looked as though they were glowing. 

My heart began to beat out of my chest and my brain was pounding. The pain made me angry. So, so angry. 

I couldn’t help but gnash my teeth and struggle violently against the puny restraints. 

I could feel my face radiating with heat and I must’ve looked completely insane judging by the nervous looks on the guards faces. 

“Wipe that fear off your faces, soldiers,” the man screamed. 

“You are marines!” 

The man looked totally in control. This made me even angrier. 

At this point it felt like there was fire beneath my skin begging to be released, and my mouth overflowed with froth. 

My anger was reaching an absolute boiling point and all that I could feel throughout my entire body was pure unbridled rage. 

I could feel the chair shaking as I thrashed and growled like a mad man, and even so, the man remained completely calm. 

I knew I was going to kill him. I knew that there was no way he’d leave this building alive. None of them would leave this building alive. They were all dead and none of them even knew it yet. 

In one final explosive burst of energy the leather restraints snapped and with supernatural speed I had sprung from the chair. 

Both guards opened fire on me immediately, but I wouldn’t go down. I could see their terrified faces, the faces of the people behind the glass, and it fueled me. 

I hobbled towards the guards, against their barrage of gunfire. 

With one swipe of my hand, I ripped the shield from the guard on the right, tearing his arm completely off of his body in the process. 

His partner had begun beating me over the head with his rifle. 

Snatching it from his hand, I heard the shattering sound of each of his fingers that he had wrapped so tightly around the weapon. 

Both guards were screaming now and, God, my GOD WAS IT INFURIATING, 

I forced the barrel of the gun deep into the guards throat. He made a gargled, wet sound, before I pulled the trigger and emptied the rest of his magazine into his stomach. 

He fell to the floor lifeless, leaving his partner alone and critically injured. 

I didn’t need to do anything to him. Enough had already been done. He would die knowing he failed. 

I looked back at the man. 

There it was. 

There was that satisfying look of terror I had been so desperately trying to evoke. 

He fumbled, clumsily, to open the door to get to the other side of the glass window. His trembling made it impossible, however. 

I drew out the moment. Savored every step I took towards him. Every beat of his heart and trickle of his sweat. 

As I stood over him he fell to his knees, like a coward. Begging for his life. 

Tears were rolling down his face as he asked God for forgiveness; asked ME for forgiveness. 

But I was beyond reason. 

The first punch knocked him out cold. I could hear his neck splinter from the second one. But I wasn’t satisfied. 

I drove my fist into his head over and over again. 

I could hear his bladder failing as fluids began to pool around his previously spotless trousers. 

I couldn’t stop. 

Once I hit brain, that’s when the seizing began. 

His thralls were unnatural and sharp. 

Though they had been mostly destroyed, his eyes rolled into his skull and his body looked like it was being lifted off the ground from his midsection as he continued to seize. 

With one final punch, his head cracked open from the front to the back. Brain matter oozed out of the wound and I stared in awe at the bloody mess in front of me. 

In the midst of my rage, I had neglected to feel the void that had opened in my stomach. 

I had never been hungrier. 

My mind told me one thing:

“You know what you want to do…”

Without even a hint of hesitation, I began picking at the brain matter that leaked from the mans destroyed head. 

It started off small, but before I could help it I was shoveling fist fulls of this guys memories directly into my mouth. 

The taste was indescribable. 

I couldn’t stop, period. 

I devoured what was left of his face before moving on to the guards. 

The more I ate, the more I felt the drugs effects kick in. 

I had almost forgotten about the people behind the window. 

They couldn’t have been so lucky. 

The window, the false mirror, it was nothing. It shattered from just one hit and they began trampling over each other trying to leave the room. 

I tore them apart, friends. 

Limb from limb, bite by bite. 

They’re all gone now. 

They’re all mine. 

I exited that warehouse covered from head to toe in their precious lifeblood, carrying with me the vile of the mystery drug that I found in the recruiters coat pocket.

Before I knew it, a quick bit of pain radiated from the crease of my right arm. 

He had stuck the needle in and injected me. 

There was no going back now. 

I expected to feel, I don’t know, organ failure or something like that. But, no. Instead, what I felt, was complete and total euphoria. 

Not like heroin, at least I don’t think; more like the strength in my body had been amplified. 

I felt…capable. 

This feeling grew and before I could register anything, I felt MORE than capable. 

I felt…disrespected that they believed these restraints could hold me and my forearm muscles began to tighten and push hard against the leather straps. 

I could see my veins pulsating. They pushed so hard against my skin that they looked as though they were glowing. 

My heart began to beat out of my chest and my brain was pounding. The pain made me angry. So, so angry. 

I couldn’t help but gnash my teeth and struggle violently against the puny restraints. 

I could feel my face radiating with heat and I must’ve looked completely insane judging by the nervous looks on the guards faces. 

“Wipe that fear off your faces, soldiers,” the man screamed. 

“You are marines!” 

The man looked totally in control. This made me even angrier. 

At this point it felt like there was fire beneath my skin begging to be released, and my mouth overflowed with froth. 

My anger was reaching an absolute boiling point and all that I could feel throughout my entire body was pure unbridled rage. 

I could feel the chair shaking as I thrashed and growled like a mad man, and even so, the man remained completely calm. 

I knew I was going to kill him. I knew that there was no way he’d leave this building alive. None of them would leave this building alive. They were all dead and none of them even knew it yet. 

In one final explosive burst of energy the leather restraints snapped and with supernatural speed I had sprung from the chair. 

Both guards opened fire on me immediately, but I wouldn’t go down. I could see their terrified faces, the faces of the people behind the glass, and it fueled me. 

I hobbled towards the guards, against their barrage of gunfire. 

With one swipe of my hand, I ripped the shield from the guard on the right, tearing his arm completely off of his body in the process. 

His partner had begun beating me over the head with his rifle. 

Snatching it from his hand, I heard the shattering sound of each of his fingers that he had wrapped so tightly around the weapon. 

Both guards were screaming now and, God, my GOD WAS IT INFURIATING, 

I forced the barrel of the gun deep into the guards throat. He made a gargled, wet sound, before I pulled the trigger and emptied the rest of his magazine into his stomach. 

He fell to the floor lifeless, leaving his partner alone and critically injured. 

I didn’t need to do anything to him. Enough had already been done. He would die knowing he failed. 

I looked back at the man. 

There it was. 

There was that satisfying look of terror I had been so desperately trying to evoke. 

He fumbled, clumsily, to open the door to get to the other side of the glass window. His trembling made it impossible, however. 

I drew out the moment. Savored every step I took towards him. Every beat of his heart and trickle of his sweat. 

As I stood over him he fell to his knees, like a coward. Begging for his life. 

Tears were rolling down his face as he asked God for forgiveness; asked ME for forgiveness. 

But I was beyond reason. 

The first punch knocked him out cold. I could hear his neck splinter from the second one. But I wasn’t satisfied. 

I drove my fist into his head over and over again. 

I could hear his bladder failing as fluids began to pool around his previously spotless trousers. 

I couldn’t stop. 

Once I hit brain, that’s when the seizing began. 

His thralls were unnatural and sharp. 

Though they had been mostly destroyed, his eyes rolled into his skull and his body looked like it was being lifted off the ground from his midsection as he continued to seize. 

With one final punch, his head cracked open from the front to the back. Brain matter oozed out of the wound and I stared in awe at the bloody mess in front of me. 

In the midst of my rage, I had neglected to feel the void that had opened in my stomach. 

I had never been hungrier. 

My mind told me one thing:

“You know what you want to do…”

Without even a hint of hesitation, I began picking at the brain matter that leaked from the mans destroyed head. 

It started off small, but before I could help it I was shoveling fist fulls of this guys memories directly into my mouth. 

The taste was indescribable. 

I couldn’t stop, period. 

I devoured what was left of his face before moving on to the guards. 

The more I ate, the more I felt the drugs effects kick in. 

I had almost forgotten about the people behind the window. 

They couldn’t have been so lucky. 

The window, the false mirror, it was nothing. It shattered from just one hit and they began trampling over each other trying to leave the room. 

I tore them apart, friends. 

Limb from limb, bite by bite. 

They’re all gone now. 

They’re all mine. 

I exited that warehouse covered from head to toe in their precious lifeblood, carrying with me the vile of the mystery drug that I found in the recruiters coat pocket. 

I could barely contain myself on the drive home. 

And that’s where I am now. 

I’m not concerned with the eviction, school, and certainly not money. 

My mind has been reprogrammed. That’s what the drug does. It’s a violent drug made for soldiers who were meant to die. A last stand drug. 

I have no intentions on dying. 

I have no intentions to stop. 

The only intention that remains in my mind…is simple:

Find more food.

I was dead broke. Fresh out of high school and struggling to pay for college. My job at the local mall wasn’t cutting it, and time was running out fast for me to cover next semesters tuition. 

During one of my very limited off-days, I had been in the grocery store, picking up a few things to hold me over for the next two weeks. 

As I stood over the frozen meat section, lost in a trance with my mind in a million places at once, I felt a hand on my shoulder. 

“Good morning, sir, how are you doing this morning?” 

I glanced over his uniform. It was too refined and decorated to be that of a recruiter. 

Looking down at my own outfit I realized that I looked, in fact, quite homeless. 

“Ah, you know. Making it through.”

“That’s excellent to hear, sir. Hey, I have a question: have you ever given any thought to the U.S. Military?” 

He asked as if he KNEW my answer, as if he could read it on my face. 

“Listen, man, I’m in college. Barely making it by, but, you know.” 

“Yes sir, I do. Mind if I ask what you’re going to school for?”

I answered honestly by telling him that I was going to be an engineer, to which he replied enthusiastically. 

“Ohhhh, man. The army is begging for some engineers. And guess what? All your schooling paid for. You help us, we help you.” 

I thought about it for a moment. I hated to admit it, but his words were swaying me a bit, and he could sense it. That was a dangerous place to be in. 

Before I got the chance to respond he spoke again. 

“Pays good too.” 

I knew I had to put a stop to this now before he got more of his foot in the door so I responded with a quick, “I’ll think about it,” as I shuffled away. 

As I walked with my back toward him he called out once more. 

“Please do! We’ll be seeing ya.” 

He then seemed to speak into what I assumed was a mic that must’ve been tucked neatly under his collar. I couldn’t make out what he said, just that his face had shifted from approachable to, what can best be described as a look of complete authority as he meandered back towards the entrance of the store. 

I hadn’t thought much of it and continued shopping as usual. 

I had work the next day and as I returned home from an absolutely soul crushing shift, I found that an envelope had been placed in the seam of my doorframe. 

It was marked with a stamp bearing the logo of the United States Army. 

“Damn,” I thought to myself. “They really don’t play about their recruitment.” 

I was about to push my way inside, ready to collapse in bed when my foot landed on yet another sheet of paper. 

“EVICTION NOTICE” in bright red lettering. 

The tape must’ve slipped right off the metal door. 

I don’t know if it was because of my exhausting shift or if my mind had just completely given up, but I simply stepped over the notice and made my way to my bedroom, tossing the envelope on the coffee table. 

I was out before my head even hit the pillow. 

The next morning, I had to fight to get out of bed. Everything seemed hopeless and, I can admit, this is the moment where I had lost faith in myself entirely. 

I remembered the words of the guy from the store. 

Schooling paid for, guaranteed benefits, guaranteed housing, plus a guaranteed job. 

Fuck it. 

I ripped the envelope open and removed its contents anxiously. 

What I read….surprised me. 

This wasn’t a recruitment letter. 

Well, it was. Just not for military recruitment. 

They weren’t asking me for my service, they weren’t even asking me to consider. This letter was to recruit people to test out a new drug that the army had been developing. 

There weren’t many details on the drug itself or its effects. But it DID include that payment for this little trial would be 5 thousand dollars for one day of my time. 

The letter looked official. It was even watermarked with the bald eagle symbol that you see the government use. 

It provided a phone number and urged me to “Call immediately if interested.”

I called and on the third ring, a man picked up. 

I recognized the voice immediately. It was the man from the store. 

“Afternoon, Donavin. I’m assuming you got our letter?” 

“Yeah, I did- wait how do you even know where I live?” 

He responded confidently. 

“It’s our job to know, son. Now, I’m assuming you’re calling because you’re interested in our trial, correct?” 

For a moment, I froze. I’d never even smoked weed before and now they want to give me 5 thousand dollars to try a drug meant for soldiers. Then I remembered the eviction notice, and it were as though my mouth spoke without permission. 

“Absolutely. I’m more than interested.” 

“Excellent, excellent. We’re sending the address over now.” 

Just as the last word escaped his lips my phone chimed with an email notification. 

It was completely blank save for the single address. It didn’t even appear to have a sender. Just an anomalous email amongst the thousands in my mailbox. 

Before I could speak, the line went dead and silenced fill the apartment once more. 

But fuck, FUCK, he hadn’t given me a time. 

“Oh, well,” I thought. “I’ll just go now.” 

Hopping in my car and inputting the address into the maps app on my phone, I found that the location was 2 hours from my home. 

“It’s 5000 dollars, it’s 5000 dollars,” I kept repeating to myself as the car ride dragged on. 

After about 45 minutes, I found that I was in the middle of nowhere and still had 75 minutes to go. 

I drove on, repeating my mantra as I passed trees, fields, and more trees. 

Finally, just on the horizon, surrounded by towering oak trees, was the most secret-government-looking facility I had ever seen. 

It must’ve been 20 stories tall, no windows, a single door directly in the center, and no cars in sight.  

I thought this was probably the strangest detail of all. 

Surely, SOMEONE had to be here besides me. 

This should’ve been the sign that made me turn around and figure things out on my own. I didn’t know just how out of my depth I really was. 

But, of course. “It’s 5000 dollars.” 

I pulled my car into the empty parking lot and started for the door. 

I opened it up and was greeted by darkness. An empty warehouse. I had been duped. 

Duped on an astonishingly professional level, but duped nonetheless. 

However, just as I began to turn and walk away, I could hear footsteps, and row by row the overhead fluorescent lights began to flicker on. 

Walking towards me with a false, corporate smile…was the man from the store. 

“Donavin,” he cheered. “So glad you could make it.” 

I glanced around suspiciously. 

“You the only person here?” 

He responded, almost eagerly:

“I’m the only person you need.” 

As he approached he extended an arm and wrapped it firmly around my shoulders.

“Follow me right this way, young man.”

As we walked a sudden feeling of dread began to come over me. Dread quickly morphed into regret and I attempted to pull away from the man. 

To my dismay, his arm did not budge. He was essentially *dragging* me across the concrete floor as I struggled timidly. 

As he pulled me he just kept…reassuring me? 

“This is what you wanted, you’re evicted, you need this. How are you going to pay for school? I promise, this will all be over soon.” 

The lights continued flickering on as we moved through the warehouse. 

Eventually, the place was illuminated enough to reveal a door that I had not noticed before; and we were headed towards it fast. 

I’m not sure how, but I managed to get my nerves under control. 

Maybe I WAS overreacting. I mean, it’s the military. I’m not selling an organ to someone on the black market or anything like that. I told myself I’d be fine. 

Once we entered the room, I was blinded by the sheer whiteness of everything, so much so that I had to squint my eyes to avoid a headache. 

Right dead in the center of the room, was a steel chair with leather restraints attached to the arm rests. 

I felt the man’s grip on me loosen as he gestured to the chair with his hand. 

“Please, Mr Meeks; have a seat.” 

Cautiously, I sat down and he began strapping my arms down tight. 

“Hey, so, uh, this isn’t really *needed* right? Just a precaution?” 

His lack of an answer concerned me. He just continued tightening the restraints. 

“Oh yeah, when do I get my mon-“ 

The man interrupted. He was no longer turned towards me, but instead was facing a mirror on the wall just to the right of me. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, we have here today: subject 1 for the conduction of the GH75 Trial. As you can see, the subject is restrained and is of no threat to anyone. I ask that you please take notes, and be prepared to discuss what you’ve learned once the trial has concluded.” 

No threat to anyone? What an odd thing to say. 

Amidst my confusion, the mirror seemed to…disappear. What was once mine and the man’s reflection, was now a window. 

On the opposite side sat about a dozen men and women dressed in military uniform, each one studiously looking on, gripping their pads and pens firmly. 

“Just as a precaution,” the man continued. 

On queue, two armed guards with swat shields aggressively entered the room, rifles trained on me. 

“This drug is experimental after all.” 

I knew I had made a mistake. 

Nothing about this was normal, but hell, what was I gonna do now? 

The man finally turned to me once more before whispering to me through a twisted smile: 

“Thank you for your service.” 

Before I knew it, a quick bit of pain radiated from the crease of my right arm. 

He had stuck the needle in and injected me.

I expected to feel, I don’t know, organ failure or something like that. But, no. Instead, what I felt, was complete and total euphoria. 

Not like heroin, at least I don’t think; more like the strength in my body had been amplified. 

I felt…capable. 

This feeling grew and before I could register anything, I felt MORE than capable. 

I felt…disrespected that they believed these restraints could hold me and my forearm muscles began to tighten and push hard against the leather straps. 

I could see my veins pulsating. They pushed so hard against my skin that they looked as though they were glowing. 

My heart began to beat out of my chest and my brain was pounding. The pain made me angry. So, so angry. 

I couldn’t help but gnash my teeth and struggle violently against the puny restraints. 

I could feel my face radiating with heat and I must’ve looked completely insane judging by the nervous looks on the guards faces. 

“Wipe that fear off your faces, soldiers,” the man screamed. 

“You are marines!” 

The man looked totally in control. This made me even angrier. 

At this point it felt like there was fire beneath my skin begging to be released, and my mouth overflowed with froth. 

My anger was reaching an absolute boiling point and all that I could feel throughout my entire body was pure unbridled rage. 

I could feel the chair shaking as I thrashed and growled like a mad man, and even so, the man remained completely calm. 

I knew I was going to kill him. I knew that there was no way he’d leave this building alive. None of them would leave this building alive. They were all dead and none of them even knew it yet. 

In one final explosive burst of energy the leather restraints snapped and with supernatural speed I had sprung from the chair. 

Both guards opened fire on me immediately, but I wouldn’t go down. I could see their terrified faces, the faces of the people behind the glass, and it fueled me. 

I hobbled towards the guards, against their barrage of gunfire. 

With one swipe of my hand, I ripped the shield from the guard on the right, tearing his arm completely off of his body in the process. 

His partner had begun beating me over the head with his rifle. 

Snatching it from his hand, I heard the shattering sound of each of his fingers that he had wrapped so tightly around the weapon. 

Both guards were screaming now and, God, my GOD WAS IT INFURIATING, 

I forced the barrel of the gun deep into the guards throat. He made a gargled, wet sound, before I pulled the trigger and emptied the rest of his magazine into his stomach. 

He fell to the floor lifeless, leaving his partner alone and critically injured. 

I didn’t need to do anything to him. Enough had already been done. He would die knowing he failed. 

I looked back at the man. 

There it was. 

There was that satisfying look of terror I had been so desperately trying to evoke. 

He fumbled, clumsily, to open the door to get to the other side of the glass window. His trembling made it impossible, however. 

I drew out the moment. Savored every step I took towards him. Every beat of his heart and trickle of his sweat. 

As I stood over him he fell to his knees, like a coward. Begging for his life. 

Tears were rolling down his face as he asked God for forgiveness; asked ME for forgiveness. 

But I was beyond reason. 

The first punch knocked him out cold. I could hear his neck splinter from the second one. But I wasn’t satisfied. 

I drove my fist into his head over and over again. 

I could hear his bladder failing as fluids began to pool around his previously spotless trousers. 

I couldn’t stop. 

Once I hit brain, that’s when the seizing began. 

His thralls were unnatural and sharp. 

Though they had been mostly destroyed, his eyes rolled into his skull and his body looked like it was being lifted off the ground from his midsection as he continued to seize. 

With one final punch, his head cracked open from the front to the back. Brain matter oozed out of the wound and I stared in awe at the bloody mess in front of me. 

In the midst of my rage, I had neglected to feel the void that had opened in my stomach. 

I had never been hungrier. 

My mind told me one thing:

“You know what you want to do…”

Without even a hint of hesitation, I began picking at the brain matter that leaked from the mans destroyed head. 

It started off small, but before I could help it I was shoveling fist fulls of this guys memories directly into my mouth. 

The taste was indescribable. 

I couldn’t stop, period. 

I devoured what was left of his face before moving on to the guards. 

The more I ate, the more I felt the drugs effects kick in. 

I had almost forgotten about the people behind the window. 

They couldn’t have been so lucky. 

The window, the false mirror, it was nothing. It shattered from just one hit and they began trampling over each other trying to leave the room. 

I tore them apart, friends. 

Limb from limb, bite by bite. 

They’re all gone now. 

They’re all mine. 

I exited that warehouse covered from head to toe in their precious lifeblood, carrying with me the vile of the mystery drug that I found in the recruiters coat pocket. 

I could barely contain myself on the drive home. 

And that’s where I am now. 

I’m not concerned with the eviction, school, and certainly not money. 

My mind has been reprogrammed. That’s what the drug does. It’s a violent drug made for soldiers who were meant to die. A last stand drug. 

I have no intentions on dying. 

I have no intentions to stop. 

The only intention that remains in my mind…is simple:

Find more food.

I was dead broke. Fresh out of high school and struggling to pay for college. My job at the local mall wasn’t cutting it, and time was running out fast for me to cover next semesters tuition. 

During one of my very limited off-days, I had been in the grocery store, picking up a few things to hold me over for the next two weeks. 

As I stood over the frozen meat section, lost in a trance with my mind in a million places at once, I felt a hand on my shoulder. 

“Good morning, sir, how are you doing this morning?” 

I glanced over his uniform. It was too refined and decorated to be that of a recruiter. 

Looking down at my own outfit I realized that I looked, in fact, quite homeless. 

“Ah, you know. Making it through.”

“That’s excellent to hear, sir. Hey, I have a question: have you ever given any thought to the U.S. Military?” 

He asked as if he KNEW my answer, as if he could read it on my face. 

“Listen, man, I’m in college. Barely making it by, but, you know.” 

“Yes sir, I do. Mind if I ask what you’re going to school for?”

I answered honestly by telling him that I was going to be an engineer, to which he replied enthusiastically. 

“Ohhhh, man. The army is begging for some engineers. And guess what? All your schooling paid for. You help us, we help you.” 

I thought about it for a moment. I hated to admit it, but his words were swaying me a bit, and he could sense it. That was a dangerous place to be in. 

Before I got the chance to respond he spoke again. 

“Pays good too.” 

I knew I had to put a stop to this now before he got more of his foot in the door so I responded with a quick, “I’ll think about it,” as I shuffled away. 

As I walked with my back toward him he called out once more. 

“Please do! We’ll be seeing ya.” 

He then seemed to speak into what I assumed was a mic that must’ve been tucked neatly under his collar. I couldn’t make out what he said, just that his face had shifted from approachable to, what can best be described as a look of complete authority as he meandered back towards the entrance of the store. 

I hadn’t thought much of it and continued shopping as usual. 

I had work the next day and as I returned home from an absolutely soul crushing shift, I found that an envelope had been placed in the seam of my doorframe. 

It was marked with a stamp bearing the logo of the United States Army. 

“Damn,” I thought to myself. “They really don’t play about their recruitment.” 

I was about to push my way inside, ready to collapse in bed when my foot landed on yet another sheet of paper. 

“EVICTION NOTICE” in bright red lettering. 

The tape must’ve slipped right off the metal door. 

I don’t know if it was because of my exhausting shift or if my mind had just completely given up, but I simply stepped over the notice and made my way to my bedroom, tossing the envelope on the coffee table. 

I was out before my head even hit the pillow. 

The next morning, I had to fight to get out of bed. Everything seemed hopeless and, I can admit, this is the moment where I had lost faith in myself entirely. 

I remembered the words of the guy from the store. 

Schooling paid for, guaranteed benefits, guaranteed housing, plus a guaranteed job. 

Fuck it. 

I ripped the envelope open and removed its contents anxiously. 

What I read….surprised me. 

This wasn’t a recruitment letter. 

Well, it was. Just not for military recruitment. 

They weren’t asking me for my service, they weren’t even asking me to consider. This letter was to recruit people to test out a new drug that the army had been developing. 

There weren’t many details on the drug itself or its effects. But it DID include that payment for this little trial would be 5 thousand dollars for one day of my time. 

The letter looked official. It was even watermarked with the bald eagle symbol that you see the government use. 

It provided a phone number and urged me to “Call immediately if interested.”

I called and on the third ring, a man picked up. 

I recognized the voice immediately. It was the man from the store. 

“Afternoon, Donavin. I’m assuming you got our letter?” 

“Yeah, I did- wait how do you even know where I live?” 

He responded confidently. 

“It’s our job to know, son. Now, I’m assuming you’re calling because you’re interested in our trial, correct?” 

For a moment, I froze. I’d never even smoked weed before and now they want to give me 5 thousand dollars to try a drug meant for soldiers. Then I remembered the eviction notice, and it were as though my mouth spoke without permission. 

“Absolutely. I’m more than interested.” 

“Excellent, excellent. We’re sending the address over now.” 

Just as the last word escaped his lips my phone chimed with an email notification. 

It was completely blank save for the single address. It didn’t even appear to have a sender. Just an anomalous email amongst the thousands in my mailbox. 

Before I could speak, the line went dead and silenced fill the apartment once more. 

But fuck, FUCK, he hadn’t given me a time. 

“Oh, well,” I thought. “I’ll just go now.” 

Hopping in my car and inputting the address into the maps app on my phone, I found that the location was 2 hours from my home. 

“It’s 5000 dollars, it’s 5000 dollars,” I kept repeating to myself as the car ride dragged on. 

After about 45 minutes, I found that I was in the middle of nowhere and still had 75 minutes to go. 

I drove on, repeating my mantra as I passed trees, fields, and more trees. 

Finally, just on the horizon, surrounded by towering oak trees, was the most secret-government-looking facility I had ever seen. 

It must’ve been 20 stories tall, no windows, a single door directly in the center, and no cars in sight.  

I thought this was probably the strangest detail of all. 

Surely, SOMEONE had to be here besides me. 

This should’ve been the sign that made me turn around and figure things out on my own. I didn’t know just how out of my depth I really was. 

But, of course. “It’s 5000 dollars.” 

I pulled my car into the empty parking lot and started for the door. 

I opened it up and was greeted by darkness. An empty warehouse. I had been duped. 

Duped on an astonishingly professional level, but duped nonetheless. 

However, just as I began to turn and walk away, I could hear footsteps, and row by row the overhead fluorescent lights began to flicker on. 

Walking towards me with a false, corporate smile…was the man from the store. 

“Donavin,” he cheered. “So glad you could make it.” 

I glanced around suspiciously. 

“You the only person here?” 

He responded, almost eagerly:

“I’m the only person you need.” 

As he approached he extended an arm and wrapped it firmly around my shoulders.

“Follow me right this way, young man.”

As we walked a sudden feeling of dread began to come over me. Dread quickly morphed into regret and I attempted to pull away from the man. 

To my dismay, his arm did not budge. He was essentially *dragging* me across the concrete floor as I struggled timidly. 

As he pulled me he just kept…reassuring me? 

“This is what you wanted, you’re evicted, you need this. How are you going to pay for school? I promise, this will all be over soon.” 

The lights continued flickering on as we moved through the warehouse. 

Eventually, the place was illuminated enough to reveal a door that I had not noticed before; and we were headed towards it fast. 

I’m not sure how, but I managed to get my nerves under control. 

Maybe I WAS overreacting. I mean, it’s the military. I’m not selling an organ to someone on the black market or anything like that. I told myself I’d be fine. 

Once we entered the room, I was blinded by the sheer whiteness of everything, so much so that I had to squint my eyes to avoid a headache. 

Right dead in the center of the room, was a steel chair with leather restraints attached to the arm rests. 

I felt the man’s grip on me loosen as he gestured to the chair with his hand. 

“Please, Mr Meeks; have a seat.” 

Cautiously, I sat down and he began strapping my arms down tight. 

“Hey, so, uh, this isn’t really *needed* right? Just a precaution?” 

His lack of an answer concerned me. He just continued tightening the restraints. 

“Oh yeah, when do I get my mon-“ 

The man interrupted. He was no longer turned towards me, but instead was facing a mirror on the wall just to the right of me. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, we have here today: subject 1 for the conduction of the GH75 Trial. As you can see, the subject is restrained and is of no threat to anyone. I ask that you please take notes, and be prepared to discuss what you’ve learned once the trial has concluded.” 

No threat to anyone? What an odd thing to say. 

Amidst my confusion, the mirror seemed to…disappear. What was once mine and the man’s reflection, was now a window. 

On the opposite side sat about a dozen men and women dressed in military uniform, each one studiously looking on, gripping their pads and pens firmly. 

“Just as a precaution,” the man continued. 

On queue, two armed guards with swat shields aggressively entered the room, rifles trained on me. 

“This drug is experimental after all.” 

I knew I had made a mistake. 

Nothing about this was normal, but hell, what was I gonna do now? 

The man finally turned to me once more before whispering to me through a twisted smile: 

“Thank you for your service.” 

Before I knew it, a quick bit of pain radiated from the crease of my right arm. 

He had stuck the needle in and injected me. 

There was no going back now. 

I expected to feel, I don’t know, organ failure or something like that. But, no. Instead, what I felt, was complete and total euphoria. 

Not like heroin, at least I don’t think; more like the strength in my body had been amplified.

I live in my car parked in my aunt's yard when I'm not at work. When my aunt is home I can use the bathroom and shower every couple days. So a few weeks ago, I had a day off, and it was a fairly sunny time out. I was right about to fall into a nap but I felt someone approaching me before I heard footsteps. It was an officer. He asked me if the residents of the home knew I was in their yard. I told him they did and gave him their names. He asked if I just didn't have anywhere to go and if I had a plan for long-term. He asked if I was allowed to use the facilities in the house, and I told him yes. 

He tried to frame his ""visit"" as a ""concerned neighbor who didn't know if"" I was homeless. Mind you, at this point I had been in my aunt's yard for over a month. They KNOW I'm homeless, and they knew it then. Then, the cop, as if LOOKING for a reason to evict me from the property, asks me ""When was the last time you were arrested?"" I looked at him incredibly puzzled as he continued ""Because I'm pretty sure the last time I saw you was when I arrested you for check fraud."" Y'all I had never been arrested let alone by this man. I told him I had never been arrested in my life. He went to check my name and made sure it matched my car's registry, and came back with ""I must've been thinking of someone else, but this is your car, and you know the residents and have permission. You're here legally. I can't legally force you off the property."" 

It was as if he was rehearsing what he was going to say to whoever called, likely someone he knew. One of my aunt's neighbors is a cop with the same police force and lives in complete view of my car. Weird that he hasn't stopped by. And it's not like I'm doing anything wrong out here. I have a grocery bag to bring in my soaps when I shower, and I bring my dirty clothes inside in a trash bag and pack them into a duffel bag. I cook my food with a coffee maker that I keep in my car, yet to them in this privileged neighborhood filled with people who get Amazon and Kroger deliveries daily, I am still a stain. It's probably because 2 school buses drive by for pick up and drop off, and they don't want to explain the concept of homelessness to their children, but that isn't my fault. The whole thing has just irked me to my very core. ",5,1765418788.0,homeless,1,0.86,False

As we walked a sudden feeling of dread began to come over me. Dread quickly morphed into regret and I attempted to pull away from the man. 

To my dismay, his arm did not budge. He was essentially *dragging* me across the concrete floor as I struggled timidly. 

As he pulled me he just kept…reassuring me? 

“This is what you wanted, you’re evicted, you need this. How are you going to pay for school? I promise, this will all be over soon.” 

The lights continued flickering on as we moved through the warehouse. 

Eventually, the place was illuminated enough to reveal a door that I had not noticed before; and we were headed towards it fast. 

I’m not sure how, but I managed to get my nerves under control. 

Maybe I WAS overreacting. I mean, it’s the military. I’m not selling an organ to someone on the black market or anything like that. I told myself I’d be fine. 

Once we entered the room, I was blinded by the sheer whiteness of everything, so much so that I had to squint my eyes to avoid a headache. 

Right dead in the center of the room, was a steel chair with leather restraints attached to the arm rests. 

I felt the man’s grip on me loosen as he gestured to the chair with his hand. 

“Please, Mr Meeks; have a seat.” 

Cautiously, I sat down and he began strapping my arms down tight. 

“Hey, so, uh, this isn’t really *needed* right? Just a precaution?” 

His lack of an answer concerned me. He just continued tightening the restraints. 

“Oh yeah, when do I get my mon-“ 

The man interrupted. He was no longer turned towards me, but instead was facing a mirror on the wall just to the right of me. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, we have here today: subject 1 for the conduction of the GH75 Trial. As you can see, the subject is restrained and is of no threat to anyone. I ask that you please take notes, and be prepared to discuss what you’ve learned once the trial has concluded.” 

No threat to anyone? What an odd thing to say. 

Amidst my confusion, the mirror seemed to…disappear. What was once mine and the man’s reflection, was now a window. 

On the opposite side sat about a dozen men and women dressed in military uniform, each one studiously looking on, gripping their pads and pens firmly. 

“Just as a precaution,” the man continued. 

On queue, two armed guards with swat shields aggressively entered the room, rifles trained on me. 

“This drug is experimental after all.” 

I knew I had made a mistake. 

Nothing about this was normal, but hell, what was I gonna do now? 

The man finally turned to me once more before whispering to me through a twisted smile: 

“Thank you for your service.” 

Before I knew it, a quick bit of pain radiated from the crease of my right arm. 

He had stuck the needle in and injected me. 

There was no going back now. 

I expected to feel, I don’t know, organ failure or something like that. But, no. Instead, what I felt, was complete and total euphoria. 

Not like heroin, at least I don’t think; more like the strength in my body had been amplified. 

I felt…capable. 

This feeling grew and before I could register anything, I felt MORE than capable. 

I felt…disrespected that they believed these restraints could hold me and my forearm muscles began to tighten and push hard against the leather straps. 

I could see my veins pulsating. They pushed so hard against my skin that they looked as though they were glowing. 

My heart began to beat out of my chest and my brain was pounding. The pain made me angry. So, so angry. 

I couldn’t help but gnash my teeth and struggle violently against the puny restraints. 

I could feel my face radiating with heat and I must’ve looked completely insane judging by the nervous looks on the guards faces. 

“Wipe that fear off your faces, soldiers,” the man screamed. 

“You are marines!” 

The man looked totally in control. This made me even angrier. 

At this point it felt like there was fire beneath my skin begging to be released, and my mouth overflowed with froth. 

My anger was reaching an absolute boiling point and all that I could feel throughout my entire body was pure unbridled rage. 

I could feel the chair shaking as I thrashed and growled like a mad man, and even so, the man remained completely calm. 

I knew I was going to kill him. I knew that there was no way he’d leave this building alive. None of them would leave this building alive. They were all dead and none of them even knew it yet. 

In one final explosive burst of energy the leather restraints snapped and with supernatural speed I had sprung from the chair. 

Both guards opened fire on me immediately, but I wouldn’t go down. I could see their terrified faces, the faces of the people behind the glass, and it fueled me. 

I hobbled towards the guards, against their barrage of gunfire. 

With one swipe of my hand, I ripped the shield from the guard on the right, tearing his arm completely off of his body in the process. 

His partner had begun beating me over the head with his rifle. 

Snatching it from his hand, I heard the shattering sound of each of his fingers that he had wrapped so tightly around the weapon. 

Both guards were screaming now and, God, my GOD WAS IT INFURIATING, 

I forced the barrel of the gun deep into the guards throat. He made a gargled, wet sound, before I pulled the trigger and emptied the rest of his magazine into his stomach. 

He fell to the floor lifeless, leaving his partner alone and critically injured. 

I didn’t need to do anything to him. Enough had already been done. He would die knowing he failed. 

I looked back at the man. 

There it was. 

There was that satisfying look of terror I had been so desperately trying to evoke. 

He fumbled, clumsily, to open the door to get to the other side of the glass window. His trembling made it impossible, however. 

I drew out the moment. Savored every step I took towards him. Every beat of his heart and trickle of his sweat. 

As I stood over him he fell to his knees, like a coward. Begging for his life. 

Tears were rolling down his face as he asked God for forgiveness; asked ME for forgiveness. 

But I was beyond reason. 

The first punch knocked him out cold. I could hear his neck splinter from the second one. But I wasn’t satisfied. 

I drove my fist into his head over and over again. 

I could hear his bladder failing as fluids began to pool around his previously spotless trousers. 

I couldn’t stop. 

Once I hit brain, that’s when the seizing began. 

His thralls were unnatural and sharp. 

Though they had been mostly destroyed, his eyes rolled into his skull and his body looked like it was being lifted off the ground from his midsection as he continued to seize. 

With one final punch, his head cracked open from the front to the back. Brain matter oozed out of the wound and I stared in awe at the bloody mess in front of me. 

In the midst of my rage, I had neglected to feel the void that had opened in my stomach. 

I had never been hungrier. 

My mind told me one thing:

“You know what you want to do…”

Without even a hint of hesitation, I began picking at the brain matter that leaked from the mans destroyed head. 

It started off small, but before I could help it I was shoveling fist fulls of this guys memories directly into my mouth. 

The taste was indescribable. 

I couldn’t stop, period. 

I devoured what was left of his face before moving on to the guards. 

The more I ate, the more I felt the drugs effects kick in. 

I had almost forgotten about the people behind the window. 

They couldn’t have been so lucky. 

The window, the false mirror, it was nothing. It shattered from just one hit and they began trampling over each other trying to leave the room. 

I tore them apart, friends. 

Limb from limb, bite by bite. 

They’re all gone now. 

They’re all mine. 

I exited that warehouse covered from head to toe in their precious lifeblood, carrying with me the vile of the mystery drug that I found in the recruiters coat pocket. 

I could barely contain myself on the drive home. 

And that’s where I am now. 

I’m not concerned with the eviction, school, and certainly not money. 

My mind has been reprogrammed. That’s what the drug does. It’s a violent drug made for soldiers who were meant to die. A last stand drug. 

I have no intentions on dying. 

I have no intentions to stop. 

The only intention that remains in my mind…is simple:

I was dead broke. Fresh out of high school and struggling to pay for college. My job at the local mall wasn’t cutting it, and time was running out fast for me to cover next semesters tuition. 

During one of my very limited off-days, I had been in the grocery store, picking up a few things to hold me over for the next two weeks. 

As I stood over the frozen meat section, lost in a trance with my mind in a million places at once, I felt a hand on my shoulder. 

“Good morning, sir, how are you doing this morning?” 

I glanced over his uniform. It was too refined and decorated to be that of a recruiter. 

Looking down at my own outfit I realized that I looked, in fact, quite homeless. 

“Ah, you know. Making it through.”

“That’s excellent to hear, sir. Hey, I have a question: have you ever given any thought to the U.S. Military?” 

He asked as if he KNEW my answer, as if he could read it on my face. 

“Listen, man, I’m in college. Barely making it by, but, you know.” 

“Yes sir, I do. Mind if I ask what you’re going to school for?”

I answered honestly by telling him that I was going to be an engineer, to which he replied enthusiastically. 

“Ohhhh, man. The army is begging for some engineers. And guess what? All your schooling paid for. You help us, we help you.” 

I thought about it for a moment. I hated to admit it, but his words were swaying me a bit, and he could sense it. That was a dangerous place to be in. 

Before I got the chance to respond he spoke again. 

“Pays good too.” 

I knew I had to put a stop to this now before he got more of his foot in the door so I responded with a quick, “I’ll think about it,” as I shuffled away. 

As I walked with my back toward him he called out once more. 

“Please do! We’ll be seeing ya.” 

He then seemed to speak into what I assumed was a mic that must’ve been tucked neatly under his collar. I couldn’t make out what he said, just that his face had shifted from approachable to, what can best be described as a look of complete authority as he meandered back towards the entrance of the store. 

I hadn’t thought much of it and continued shopping as usual. 

I had work the next day and as I returned home from an absolutely soul crushing shift, I found that an envelope had been placed in the seam of my doorframe. 

It was marked with a stamp bearing the logo of the United States Army. 

“Damn,” I thought to myself. “They really don’t play about their recruitment.” 

I was about to push my way inside, ready to collapse in bed when my foot landed on yet another sheet of paper. 

“EVICTION NOTICE” in bright red lettering. 

The tape must’ve slipped right off the metal door. 

I don’t know if it was because of my exhausting shift or if my mind had just completely given up, but I simply stepped over the notice and made my way to my bedroom, tossing the envelope on the coffee table. 

I was out before my head even hit the pillow. 

The next morning, I had to fight to get out of bed. Everything seemed hopeless and, I can admit, this is the moment where I had lost faith in myself entirely. 

I remembered the words of the guy from the store. 

Schooling paid for, guaranteed benefits, guaranteed housing, plus a guaranteed job. 

Fuck it. 

I ripped the envelope open and removed its contents anxiously. 

What I read….surprised me. 

This wasn’t a recruitment letter. 

Well, it was. Just not for military recruitment. 

They weren’t asking me for my service, they weren’t even asking me to consider. This letter was to recruit people to test out a new drug that the army had been developing. 

There weren’t many details on the drug itself or its effects. But it DID include that payment for this little trial would be 5 thousand dollars for one day of my time. 

The letter looked official. It was even watermarked with the bald eagle symbol that you see the government use. 

It provided a phone number and urged me to “Call immediately if interested.”

I called and on the third ring, a man picked up. 

I recognized the voice immediately. It was the man from the store. 

“Afternoon, Donavin. I’m assuming you got our letter?” 

“Yeah, I did- wait how do you even know where I live?” 

He responded confidently. 

“It’s our job to know, son. Now, I’m assuming you’re calling because you’re interested in our trial, correct?” 

For a moment, I froze. I’d never even smoked weed before and now they want to give me 5 thousand dollars to try a drug meant for soldiers. Then I remembered the eviction notice, and it were as though my mouth spoke without permission. 

“Absolutely. I’m more than interested.” 

“Excellent, excellent. We’re sending the address over now.” 

Just as the last word escaped his lips my phone chimed with an email notification. 

It was completely blank save for the single address. It didn’t even appear to have a sender. Just an anomalous email amongst the thousands in my mailbox. 

Before I could speak, the line went dead and silenced fill the apartment once more. 

But fuck, FUCK, he hadn’t given me a time. 

“Oh, well,” I thought. “I’ll just go now.” 

Hopping in my car and inputting the address into the maps app on my phone, I found that the location was 2 hours from my home. 

“It’s 5000 dollars, it’s 5000 dollars,” I kept repeating to myself as the car ride dragged on. 

After about 45 minutes, I found that I was in the middle of nowhere and still had 75 minutes to go. 

I drove on, repeating my mantra as I passed trees, fields, and more trees. 

Finally, just on the horizon, surrounded by towering oak trees, was the most secret-government-looking facility I had ever seen. 

It must’ve been 20 stories tall, no windows, a single door directly in the center, and no cars in sight.  

I thought this was probably the strangest detail of all. 

Surely, SOMEONE had to be here besides me. 

This should’ve been the sign that made me turn around and figure things out on my own. I didn’t know just how out of my depth I really was. 

But, of course. “It’s 5000 dollars.” 

I pulled my car into the empty parking lot and started for the door. 

I opened it up and was greeted by darkness. An empty warehouse. I had been duped. 

Duped on an astonishingly professional level, but duped nonetheless. 

However, just as I began to turn and walk away, I could hear footsteps, and row by row the overhead fluorescent lights began to flicker on. 

Walking towards me with a false, corporate smile…was the man from the store. 

“Donavin,” he cheered. “So glad you could make it.” 

I glanced around suspiciously. 

“You the only person here?” 

He responded, almost eagerly:

“I’m the only person you need.” 

As he approached he extended an arm and wrapped it firmly around my shoulders.

“Follow me right this way, young man.”

As we walked a sudden feeling of dread began to come over me. Dread quickly morphed into regret and I attempted to pull away from the man. 

To my dismay, his arm did not budge. He was essentially *dragging* me across the concrete floor as I struggled timidly. 

As he pulled me he just kept…reassuring me? 

“This is what you wanted, you’re evicted, you need this. How are you going to pay for school? I promise, this will all be over soon.” 

The lights continued flickering on as we moved through the warehouse. 

Eventually, the place was illuminated enough to reveal a door that I had not noticed before; and we were headed towards it fast. 

I’m not sure how, but I managed to get my nerves under control. 

Maybe I WAS overreacting. I mean, it’s the military. I’m not selling an organ to someone on the black market or anything like that. I told myself I’d be fine. 

Once we entered the room, I was blinded by the sheer whiteness of everything, so much so that I had to squint my eyes to avoid a headache. 

Right dead in the center of the room, was a steel chair with leather restraints attached to the arm rests. 

I felt the man’s grip on me loosen as he gestured to the chair with his hand. 

“Please, Mr Meeks; have a seat.” 

Cautiously, I sat down and he began strapping my arms down tight. 

“Hey, so, uh, this isn’t really *needed* right? Just a precaution?” 

His lack of an answer concerned me. He just continued tightening the restraints. 

“Oh yeah, when do I get my mon-“ 

The man interrupted. He was no longer turned towards me, but instead was facing a mirror on the wall just to the right of me. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, we have here today: subject 1 for the conduction of the GH75 Trial. As you can see, the subject is restrained and is of no threat to anyone. I ask that you please take notes, and be prepared to discuss what you’ve learned once the trial has concluded.” 

No threat to anyone? What an odd thing to say. 

Amidst my confusion, the mirror seemed to…disappear. What was once mine and the man’s reflection, was now a window. 

On the opposite side sat about a dozen men and women dressed in military uniform, each one studiously looking on, gripping their pads and pens firmly. 

“Just as a precaution,” the man continued. 

On queue, two armed guards with swat shields aggressively entered the room, rifles trained on me. 

“This drug is experimental after all.” 

I knew I had made a mistake. 

Nothing about this was normal, but hell, what was I gonna do now? 

The man finally turned to me once more before whispering to me through a twisted smile: 

“Thank you for your service.” 

Before I knew it, a quick bit of pain radiated from the crease of my right arm. 

He had stuck the needle in and injected me. 

There was no going back now. 

I expected to feel, I don’t know, organ failure or something like that. But, no. Instead, what I felt, was complete and total euphoria. 

Not like heroin, at least I don’t think; more like the strength in my body had been amplified. 

I felt…capable. 

This feeling grew and before I could register anything, I felt MORE than capable. 

I felt…disrespected that they believed these restraints could hold me and my forearm muscles began to tighten and push hard against the leather straps. 

I could see my veins pulsating. They pushed so hard against my skin that they looked as though they were glowing. 

My heart began to beat out of my chest and my brain was pounding. The pain made me angry. So, so angry. 

I couldn’t help but gnash my teeth and struggle violently against the puny restraints. 

I could feel my face radiating with heat and I must’ve looked completely insane judging by the nervous looks on the guards faces. 

“Wipe that fear off your faces, soldiers,” the man screamed. 

“You are marines!” 

The man looked totally in control. This made me even angrier. 

At this point it felt like there was fire beneath my skin begging to be released, and my mouth overflowed with froth. 

My anger was reaching an absolute boiling point and all that I could feel throughout my entire body was pure unbridled rage. 

I could feel the chair shaking as I thrashed and growled like a mad man, and even so, the man remained completely calm. 

I knew I was going to kill him. I knew that there was no way he’d leave this building alive. None of them would leave this building alive. They were all dead and none of them even knew it yet. 

In one final explosive burst of energy the leather restraints snapped and with supernatural speed I had sprung from the chair. 

Both guards opened fire on me immediately, but I wouldn’t go down. I could see their terrified faces, the faces of the people behind the glass, and it fueled me. 

I hobbled towards the guards, against their barrage of gunfire.

Snatching it from his hand, I heard the shattering sound of each of his fingers that he had wrapped so tightly around the weapon. 

Both guards were screaming now and, God, my GOD WAS IT INFURIATING, 

I forced the barrel of the gun deep into the guards throat. He made a gargled, wet sound, before I pulled the trigger and emptied the rest of his magazine into his stomach. 

He fell to the floor lifeless, leaving his partner alone and critically injured. 

I didn’t need to do anything to him. Enough had already been done. He would die knowing he failed.

But I was beyond reason. 

The first punch knocked him out cold. I could hear his neck splinter from the second one. But I wasn’t satisfied. 

I drove my fist into his head over and over again. 

I could hear his bladder failing as fluids began to pool around his previously spotless trousers. 

I couldn’t stop. 

Once I hit brain, that’s when the seizing began. 

His thralls were unnatural and sharp. 

Though they had been mostly destroyed, his eyes rolled into his skull and his body looked like it was being lifted off the ground from his midsection as he continued to seize. 

With one final punch, his head cracked open from the front to the back. Brain matter oozed out of the wound and I stared in awe at the bloody mess in front of me. 

In the midst of my rage, I had neglected to feel the void that had opened in my stomach. 

I had never been hungrier.

I made plenty of eye contact throughout the date, but the girl had a hard time returning it. It didn't seem like it was an issue being disinterested because the conversation was flowing. She had this odd pattern of sporadic blinking and darting her eyes left and right. It was extra unusual because when I first met her, before I invited her for a date, she was always really good at returning it.  
  
For me personally, I used to do this a lot when talking to people due to my social anxiety, especially with my crushes. So, I thought it might be nervousness. Honestly, we were talking about pretty normal stuff, a bit bland I might add, so I don't know maybe I did something to make her uncomfortable or maybe I'm ugly or something :/.

I wasn’t looking for a career, and I certainly wasn’t looking for a ""work family."" I was twenty-something, drowning in rent for a shoebox apartment, and my cat had just developed a bladder issue that cost more than my car. So when a mid-sized marketing firm offered me a generic coordinator role with health insurance, I didn’t ask questions. I told myself I’d do a year. Keep my head down, pay my bills, and get out before the fluorescent lights sucked the soul out of me.
My first week was standard corporate stuff. Bad coffee, awkward elevator small talk, trying to figure out how the printer worked. It was boring, which was exactly what I wanted.
But then I met Adam.
You know those people who have zero concept of a ""personal bubble""? That was Adam. He was the office manager, I think, or maybe IT—his role was vague, which meant he was everywhere, all the time. He had this frantic, golden-retriever energy that felt exhausting just to look at.
The first time we met, he didn’t just say hi; he practically cornered me by the water cooler. He leaned in way too close, smelling like cheap cologne and desperation.
""Welcome to the team,"" he’d said, his eyes wide and unblinking. ""You’re going to love it here. Seriously, if you need anything—and I mean anything—I’m your guy.""
At the time, I just thought he was socially awkward. Maybe lonely. I gave him a polite smile, said thanks, and went back to my desk. I figured he was harmless.
I was an idiot.
It started small. By my third day, he somehow knew my entire schedule better than I did. If I had a meeting at 2:00 PM, he’d pop by my desk at 1:55 PM to ""remind me."" By the end of the first week, he knew which car was mine in the parking lot.
But the real red flag—the one I ignored because I was tired and polite—happened on the Monday of my second week.
I was walking from my car to the building entrance, dreading the morning, when Adam popped out from behind a pillar. He was holding a cup of coffee. Not just any coffee—a medium vanilla cold brew with oat milk. My specific, overly complicated order.
""Don't worry,"" he said, seeing the look on my face. ""I saw you walk in with that cup on your first day. Figured you needed a boost.""
My stomach did a little flip. I hadn’t told anyone my order. He must have literally watched me drink it, or maybe even fished the cup out of my trash bin to check the label. But instead of running away, I did what women are conditioned to do: I didn’t want to be rude.
I took the coffee. I thanked him.
He lit up like I’d just proposed marriage. It wasn't a normal smile; it was a beam of pure, intense relief, like he finally had a purpose. Looking back, that was the moment I sealed my fate.
After that, the boundaries didn't just blur; they evaporated.
Adam became a permanent fixture in my life. If I went to lunch, he was suddenly there, unpacking a sandwich next to me. If I put headphones on to focus, he’d stand behind my chair until I felt his presence and took them off.
Then the mimicking started. It was subtle at first, then glaring.
I started wearing my hair in a messy bun; the next day, Adam was wearing a beanie that pushed his hair up in a similar way. I used a specific slang word in a meeting; he used it five times before lunch.
The worst was the mountain trip. I had casually mentioned to a different coworker—not Adam—that I was thinking of booking a solo weekend at a cabin to decompress. The very next morning, Adam slid his chair over to my desk.
""So, I booked the cabin!"" he announced.
I blinked. ""What cabin?""
""The one in the mountains! Same dates you were talking about. I figured we could carpool. It’ll be way cheaper, and honestly, those roads are dangerous alone.""
My skin crawled. I immediately lied. I told him I’d had a family emergency and had to cancel. I expected him to be bummed and cancel his own trip.
He didn't. He went alone. And all weekend, my phone buzzed with photos of the empty cabin, the fireplace, the view. Wish you were here, the texts said. It’s so quiet without you.
By this point, I was done. The job was stressful enough without a stage-five clinger breathing down my neck. The pay wasn't worth the anxiety.
One Tuesday afternoon, after a particularly brutal client call, I hit my breaking point. I was in the copy room, rubbing my temples, when Adam walked in. I didn't even filter myself.
""I think I’m gonna quit,"" I muttered, mostly to myself. ""I can't do this place anymore.""
The air instantly left the room.
I looked up. Adam had gone pale. Not just pale—grey. He looked like I’d just told him I was murdering his mother.
""You... you can't,"" he whispered.
""Adam, it's just a job. I'm burnt out.""
""No!"" He lunged forward and grabbed my wrist. His grip was surprisingly strong, his palms damp. ""You can't leave. Come with me.""
Before I could protest, he dragged me into the break room and slammed the door. Then—and this is the part that still haunts me—he locked it.
He stood in front of the door, hyperventilating. Then he burst into tears. I’m talking full-on, ugly sobbing.
""I didn't want anyone to know,"" he choked out, snot running down his face. ""But I have cancer. It's stage three. I found out two months ago.""
I froze. My annoyance vanished, replaced by a wave of cold shock.
""Adam... oh my god.""
""You're the only reason I come in,"" he sobbed. ""You're the only person here who treats me like a human being. If you leave... I don't know if I can keep fighting this. I need you here. Please. Just... don't leave me alone to die.""
I stood there, paralyzed. My brain was screaming that this felt weird, that the timing was too convenient. But he was crying. He was talking about dying. You don't accuse someone of faking cancer in the company break room.
So, I caved. I hugged him. I told him I was so sorry. I promised I wouldn't quit—at least, not right away. I told him I’d stay and support him.
And that was the second mistake. The big one.
Because the second the words ""I'll stay"" left my mouth, the crying stopped.
It didn't taper off. It just stopped.
He pulled back, wiped his face with the back of his hand, and took a deep breath. When he looked at me, his eyes weren't sad anymore. They were clear. Focused. Almost happy.
It was like watching someone flip a light switch.
""Thank you,"" he said, his voice completely steady. ""I knew you were special.""
He unlocked the door and walked out like nothing had happened.
From that moment on, the dynamic shifted. He wasn't just the annoying guy who had a crush on me anymore. He acted like he owned me. Like my life was collateral for his survival.
And the sickest part? I believed him. For a while, anyway.

Here’s the thing about manipulative people: they don’t just lie to you; they recruit you. They make you an actor in their play without handing you a script.
After the break room confession, I didn’t just feel bad for Adam; I felt responsible for him. I became his emotional support animal. And because I’m a person who creates spreadsheets for my grocery shopping, I approached his ""cancer"" like a project manager. I wanted to help him beat it.
That was the problem. He didn’t want help beating it. He just wanted the attention that came with having it.
The weeks following his confession were a blur of manufactured crises. He’d text me at 11:00 PM on a Tuesday saying he was ""scared and couldn't breathe."" When I’d offer to call an ambulance, he’d refuse and say, ""No, just stay on the phone with me until I fall asleep.""
So I would. I’d stay on the phone for two hours, listening to him breathe, ruining my own sleep schedule because I was terrified that if I hung up, he’d die.
At work, it was even worse. He used his diagnosis as a shield against everything. If his boss asked why a report was late, Adam would slump in his chair, rub his temples, and whisper about ""brain fog"" from the meds. If I tried to go to lunch with anyone else, he’d give me this wounded puppy look and say, ""Oh, go ahead. I’ll just sit here and try to eat some crackers. My stomach is a mess today.""
Of course, I’d cancel my plans and sit with him.
He even shaved his head. I remember walking in on Monday morning and seeing him completely bald. He was wearing a slightly oversized beanie, looking frail and tragic. Everyone in the office fawned over him. People brought him casseroles. The CEO gave him a flexible schedule.
And I stood there, feeling like the keeper of his sacred trust, the only one who really knew his pain.
But about a month in, the cracks started to show. And they were stupid cracks. Little things that didn’t make sense, but I kept brushing them aside because... well, who fakes cancer?
The Burrito Incident
The first red flag happened at a Mexican place near the office. Adam had spent the entire morning complaining about his mouth sores. He told me the chemo gave him metallic-tasting ulcers and that he could barely swallow water. He was putting on a great performance, wincing every time he took a sip of tea.
Then we went to lunch.
I ordered a salad. Adam ordered the ""Mega-Fire Burrito.""
I stared at him. ""Adam, isn't that going to hurt? You said you have ulcers.""
He froze for a millisecond—just a glitch in the matrix—before recovering. ""Oh, the doctor said spicy food actually cauterizes them. It helps the healing process. It's a holistic thing.""
Cauterizes them?
I’m no oncologist, but that sounded like absolute nonsense. Still, I didn’t say anything. I watched him inhale a burrito the size of a human infant, wiping hot sauce off his lip, completely pain-free.
The ""Chemo"" Schedule
The second red flag was his schedule. He told me his treatments were on Thursday afternoons. Every Thursday at 1:00 PM, he’d pack up his bag, give me a brave little wave, and shuffle out of the office.
One Thursday, I had to leave early for a dentist appointment around the same time. I saw Adam walking toward his car, so I jogged to catch up, thinking I’d walk him out.
""Hey! Good luck today,"" I called out.
He jumped about a foot in the air. He turned around, and he wasn't looking frail or sick. He looked annoyed.
""Thanks,"" he said shortly, unlocking his car.
""Which hospital are you at again? St. Mary's?"" I asked, just making conversation.
""Uh, yeah. St. Mary's.""
""That's weird,"" I said, frowning. ""I thought St. Mary's didn't do oncology on Thursdays? My aunt goes there.""
He blinked. His eyes darted to the left. ""They... they opened a special wing. Just for emergency cases like mine. It's new. You wouldn't know about it.""
He got in his car and sped off before I could ask anything else.
The Discovery
The final straw wasn't something he said. It was something I saw.
It had been three months. I was exhausted. I was depressed. I felt like I was living two lives: my actual job, and my job as Adam's caretaker. I had stopped seeing my friends because Adam made me feel guilty for having ""fun"" while he was ""dying.""
One Thursday, Adam did his usual routine. He groaned, held his stomach, said it was ""treatment time,"" and left at 1:00 PM.
About twenty minutes later, I realized he’d left his phone charger on my desk. He usually panicked without it. I figured I’d be a hero and drive it over to St. Mary's. It was only ten minutes away. I could drop it at the front desk and leave.
I drove to the hospital. I walked up to the reception desk in the oncology wing.
""Hi,"" I said to the nurse. ""I'm looking for a patient. Adam [Last Name]. He’s here for chemotherapy?""
The nurse typed into her computer. She frowned. She typed again.
""I'm sorry, honey,"" she said, looking over her glasses. ""We don't have a patient by that name.""
""He comes every Thursday,"" I insisted. ""Stage three cancer?""
She shook her head. ""I’ve been working Thursdays for five years. I’ve never seen him. And we don’t have him in the system.""
I felt a cold flush go down my body. ""Maybe he’s in a different wing? The new emergency wing?""
The nurse looked at me with pity. ""We don't have a new emergency wing.""
I walked back to my car, my hands shaking. I didn’t go back to work. Instead, on a hunch, I drove past the movie theater that was halfway between our office and his apartment.
And there it was.
His silver Honda Civic. Parked right in the front row.
I parked across the street and waited. I sat there for two hours, stewing in a mix of rage and humiliation. I felt sick. I felt violated. I had cried for this man. I had held his hand.
At 4:00 PM, the theater doors opened.
Adam walked out.
He wasn't limping. He wasn't in pain.
He was holding a large tub of popcorn and laughing at something on his phone. He looked healthy. He looked happy. He looked like a man who was enjoying his afternoon off while I did his work back at the office.
I took a picture of him.
Then I put my car in drive and went home.
I didn't confront him that night. I didn't text him.
I just sat in my apartment, staring at the photo, realizing that the ""obsessive coworker"" wasn't just annoying. He was dangerous.
And I realized something else: if he was willing to lie about dying just to keep me close, what was he going to do when he found out I knew the truth?

You’d think finding out the truth would make things easier. Like, Aha! He’s a liar! Case closed!
It didn’t. It made everything nauseating.
I had to go into work the next morning knowing that the person sitting four feet away from me was a sociopath. I sat in my car in the parking lot for twenty minutes, hyping myself up just to walk through the front doors.
When I finally got to my desk, Adam was already there. He was wearing a thick sweater, huddled over his keyboard, doing his ""post-chemo"" performance.
""Morning,"" he croaked, his voice a rasp. ""Rough night. Barely slept. The nausea was… it was a lot.""
I looked at him. Really looked at him. I saw the healthy glow of his skin. The brightness in his eyes that he was trying to hide by squinting. The faint smell of movie theater butter that seemed to cling to his jacket.
I wanted to scream. I wanted to flip my desk. Instead, I just sat down and turned on my computer.
""I’m sorry,"" I said, my voice flat. ""That sounds hard.""
He perked up, sensing an opportunity for sympathy. ""Yeah. It’s just… it makes you realize who really matters, you know? I was thinking about us yesterday while I was hooked up to the IV.""
While you were watching previews, I thought.
""Adam,"" I said, cutting him off. ""I have a lot of work to do.""
He frowned. The ""sick boy"" mask slipped for a second, replaced by confusion. I wasn't playing my part. I wasn't cooing over him.
""Is everything okay?"" he asked, spinning his chair around. ""You seem distant.""
""I'm fine.""
""You're not fine. You're being weird. Did I do something?""
""Adam, drop it.""
""No, I won't drop it!"" His voice rose, sharp and sudden. ""I’m going through hell, and you’re giving me the cold shoulder? After everything we talked about? I thought you cared about me!""
That was it. The snap.
I didn't plan to do it right there. I wanted to go to HR first. I wanted a paper trail. But the sheer audacity of him yelling at me about his fake suffering broke something in my brain.
I spun my chair to face him. The office was relatively quiet; a few heads turned our way.
""You were at the movies, Adam.""
The silence that followed was heavy. Thick.
He blinked. ""What?""
""Yesterday. Thursday. At 4:00 PM. You weren't at St. Mary's getting chemo. You were at the AMC off Highway 9. You saw the new Marvel movie.""
He laughed. It was a nervous, high-pitched sound. ""You’re crazy. I was at the hospital. The meds must be making you—""
I pulled my phone out. I opened the gallery. I shoved the screen in his face.
The photo was clear. Him, the popcorn, the sunny afternoon light hitting his very healthy face.
""There is no new wing at St. Mary's,"" I said, my voice shaking—not from sadness, but from rage. ""The nurse has never heard of you. You don't have cancer, Adam. You're just a liar.""
I expected him to crumble. I expected him to cry again, to beg for forgiveness, to say he made a mistake because he was lonely.
He didn't.
Adam stopped hunching. He sat up straight. The ""pain"" in his face evaporated instantly, replaced by a cold, blank expression. He looked at the photo, then he looked at me.
""You were following me?"" he said softly.
""What?""
""You followed me to the theater. That’s stalking.""
I gaped at him. ""Excuse me? You are faking a terminal illness to manipulate me into staying at a job I hate, and you're calling me the stalker?""
""I did it for you,"" he said. And he said it so calmly it made my blood freeze. ""You were going to leave. You were going to abandon me. I had to give you a reason to stay. I was trying to be your friend. I was trying to make you a better person.""
""You're insane,"" I whispered.
""And you're ungrateful."" His eyes narrowed. ""Go ahead. Tell them. Tell HR. Who are they going to believe? The guy with stage three cancer, or the girl who stalks him to movie theaters?""
""I have proof,"" I said, holding up the phone.
He smirked. ""And I have your medical records.""
My heart stopped.
""What?""
""I'm the Office Manager, remember? I have the keys to the file room. I know about your anxiety medication. I know about your therapy appointments. If you try to ruin me, I’ll tell everyone you’re having a breakdown. I’ll tell them you’re obsessed with me. I’ll make sure you never get hired in this city again.""
For a second, I believed him. He looked so confident, so comfortable in his cruelty.
But then I looked around.
Our ""private"" confrontation wasn't private.
Three coworkers were standing near the printer, mouths open. The receptionist was staring over her monitor. And standing in the doorway of his office, about ten feet away, was the VP of Operations.
He had heard everything.
Adam followed my gaze. He saw the VP. His smirk fell.
The VP didn't say a word. He just pointed at Adam, then pointed at his office door.
The Fallout
Adam was fired an hour later.
He didn't go quietly. We could hear him screaming through the glass walls of the conference room. He wasn't crying this time; he was raging. He called us all traitors. He threw a stapler at the wall. Security had to escort him out.
As he was being dragged past my desk, he didn't look at the floor. He looked right at me. He locked eyes with me and mouthed three words.
This isn't over.
I quit the next day. I didn't give two weeks' notice. I just emailed them a resignation letter, blocked everyone’s number, and never went back.
I moved apartments three months later. I got a new job in a different industry where nobody knew me. I blocked Adam on every social media platform, locked my profiles, and changed my phone number.
For a long time, I was jumpy. Every time I saw a silver Honda Civic, my heart hammered against my ribs. Every time I got a ""No Caller ID"" call, I let it go to voicemail.
It’s been two years now. I haven't seen him.
But sometimes, on really quiet nights, I’ll get a friend request on Facebook from a blank profile. Or I’ll get an email from a random address that just says:
Miss you.
I don't delete them anymore. I print them out. I add them to the file I keep in my safe, right next to the restraining order. Just in case.
Because the thing about people like Adam is—they don't stop. They just wait.",1,1765418520.0,u_BruzkyYT,0,1.0,False

1pjlbvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScriptureLife/comments/1pjlbvs/scripture_life_cults_how_accurate_is_the_new/,Scripture Life: Cults.  How accurate is the New World translation of the Bible?,"This *“How accurate…”* part:

**accurate.** <definition>. Source: Oxford dictionary. Web. 1. *free from error; in accordance with fact or truth.* (accessed: 10 December 2025).

So, “How “free from error; in accordance with fact or truth” is the Jehovah’s Witness “Holy Scriptures” because, the fact is, the Jehovah’s Witnesses themselves, are the source of the New World Translation, quote: “Bible.” <See the Jehovah’s Witnesses main website on the internet - - Web. “JW(dot)org” >

* Have to be in accordance with “fact and truth” then:
   * Fact: Jehovah’s Witnesses were “birthed” out of Charles Taze Russell. Over in America (1852 - 1916). Him, like a whole pile of turd people. Like a conveyor belt of just turds pooped out - shovel onto people of the 19th Century, both before him, and alongside him.
   * Where Charles Taze Russell preached and fully believed he could predict the very year Jesus was to come back. Just like those, like Joseph Miller and the “Millerites” of 1833. He also claimed exactly what day, exactly, Jesus was going to come back; then, changed it. When he didn’t come back. That, some “Fact or Truth” of his predicition, had an “error” in it. That, it was just the year then. But even in the year Joseph Miller predicted, and he has a HUGE following or gaggle of people that just eat turd, off the conveyor belt, where the sign on the conveyor belt said “FRESH DONUTS”
   * The “Truth or Fact” was..nothing Joseph Miller said or predicted. NOT ONE THING CAME TRUE. Lost a lot of followers; but a core small group: stuck to his “predictions” and just “reclaimed” them. They happened in the Spiritual World; where Miller got it wrong was say it was in the physical world. So, when Jesus did not appear in 1844 - everybody abandoned Joseph Miller and the Millerites fizzled out. But this is called the “Origin of the Seventh Day Adventist Movement.” That after Miller, comes Ellen G. White that blabblo-blappy blares this out - that the reason Jesus didn’t come back was, Christians were worshipping him on the wrong day, so he didn’t come back. Held the truth then, it was because Christians were worshipping Jesus on Sunday; vs. how the Jews worship him. On Saturday. Oh, what a great big, pile of crap.
   * **Wow! And.. …What a great, big clue. Everything with the Jehovah’s Witnesses, where some of us, lived thru their predictions of 1975 and the few years before it, every “Watchtower! Magazine printed each month before it, left on our front porch, blared it out. Jesus is now coming back in Autumn of 1975.**
   * Then..he didn’t. Then, changed it. He came back in the Spiritual World and is in hiding. Even scripture says, when Jesus comes back, “all eyes shall see him” in Revelation 1:7, even those that pierced him - so EVERYBODY from Adam forward shall see him come back. Oh what another great, big gigantic fact poop slapped into EVERY Jehovah’s Witnesses face, who they follow isn’t Jesus - they follow some pile of turd..abominable people claiming they speak for Jesus when they speak for themselves - and they are abominably immoral people. A Governing body of liars. That’s all they are. Nothing more. That’s the Fact and Truth that leads Jehovah’s Witnesses. Doesn’t have any God in it, or the God it does have, isn’t God that runs it. Run on lies. ANd the Father of Lies is plainly said “WHO” he is.
   * So, just ANYBODY there is over the whole earth can compare Joseph Miller, and the “Millerites” as the founder of the Seventh Day Adventists, and their predictions when Jesus will come back vs. Charles Taze Russell, a generation after the Seventh Day Adventists,
   * Telling EVERYBODY the secret to when Jesus comes back is in his calculations of the Pyramid a “Geeza” (Giza) in Egypt. That, the calculations used to build it, held the secret. Even Charles Taze Russel’s tombstone, for decades, was a “pyramid.” What a load of crap.
   * That, when he did not come back, Charles Taze Russell did exactly like the earlier Seventh Day Adventists did. Just claim the earthly happened in the heavenly. That, just like the Church of Christ, Scientists believe that, founded in Mary Baker Eddy (1821 - 1910) - that Jesus is Mary Baker Eddy..came back in her teachings. That, God is “science” - that, to save her movement, she took her husband, who she said she “cured” back East to New England from San Francisco, where the CHurch of Christ, Scientists Headquarter is or was in. So he could secretly die there back East. Oh, what another turd on the conveyor belt speaks. All great big donuts of fact and truth. That, when Fact and Truth are applied to it, turns out it’s just a TURD claiming it’s a donut.
   * **Not one fact, or prediction the Jehovah’s Witness Governing Body in New York: NOT ONE OF THEIR PREDICTIONS FROM INCEPTION - NOT ONE OF THEM HAS COME TRUE.**
   * Everyone of them, they “back peddle” on - Afterall, look at all the DOG TURD on the conveyor belt being spewed out with it, all did the SAME THING and think, by it, survived when the truth didn’t pan out as they predicted it would.

You can take all three of these CULTS: Seventh Day Adventists, Church of Christ, Scientology, and Jehovah’s Witnesses and toss them in the trash can.

Just because I put a “DUNKIN’ DONUTS” sign with a box for Dunkin’ donuts next to a dog turd, with a Dunkin’ Donuts Large coffee and a Maple Bar from Dunkin’ donuts next to it, does not change the dog turd into a donut.

* Even if people believe it true. The fact and truth is, the box is from there and has their logo on it; but the dog turd originated from the neighbor’s dog across the street. Freshly crapped out, doesn’t mean you eat it, even if people put a Dunkin Donuts box next to it, if you smell stench and stink and the box claims that’s you, because, you haven’t ate the donut, you are being lied to.

1pjl8eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/OneStopCentre/comments/1pjl8eg/the_simple_grocery_list_system_that_saves_me_time/,The simple grocery list system that saves me time and money every week,"I used to walk into the supermarket **for a few things** and walk out 40 minutes later with a full trolley, random snacks and a receipt that made no sense.

Now I use a really simple grocery list system that takes 5-10 minutes and quietly saves me both time and money every week. You can do it in a **notes app, spreadsheet, PDF fillable or on a printable template**, the layout is the key.



**1.** Use one layout every week

I stopped writing a fresh, chaotic list each time and made a fixed layout with sections.



* Fruit & veg
* Protein (meat, tofu, eggs, etc.)
* Pantry (rice, pasta, tins, sauces)
* Fridge & dairy
* Freezer
* Household (cleaning, toiletries, pet, etc.)



Same sections, same order, every week. It matches how I usually walk the store, so I’m not doubling back.

 

**2.** Keep a running list during the week

Instead of trying to remember everything on shopping day, I:



* Keep the list on the fridge or phone
* Add items the moment they run low (or when I notice I need them)

By the time I’m ready to shop, **60-70%** of the list is already done.



**3.** Do a quick 3-minute **house check** before you leave

Right before I go, I quickly check:  


* Fridge for stuff that needs using soon
* Pantry for staples (rice, pasta, oil, coffee, snacks)
* Cleaning and bathroom items

  
If I don’t need it, it doesn’t go on the list. This stops **just in case** duplicates piling up.

  
**4.** In the store, list first, then one **flex box**.

**My rule now is:**  


* Buy everything on the list first
* Only then allow myself a tiny **flex box** for extras (e.g. 2-3 unplanned items like specials or a treat)

  
That one little boundary stops the trolley from exploding.

  
**5.** Park ideas for next week

If I see something interesting that doesn’t fit the budget this week, I jot it in a small **Next time** space on the list. That way I don’t feel like I’m missing out, but I also don’t blow the budget.

Since doing this, my shop is faster, I waste less food, and my receipt is much more predictable.

 

**Curious how other people do it and what you use for your grocery list?**  


* Do you organise your grocery list in sections, or just one long list?

I’ve been interested in penpaling ever since I was a kid. The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to swept me away, making me endlessly fascinated in the many things this world seemed to have out there to be discovered and experienced. That was back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from halfway across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. Since then, I’ve been fortunate enough to have people to exchange with, and I’d like to see if I can find that again.

I’m looking for someone that I first and foremost have a connection with. I want to actually get to know my penpal. Location doesn’t matter as much, as who that person is defines whether I’d like to engage with them or not. I do have a preference for cultural exchange in which we can be introduced to different and new things. But, whether you’re my state or half the world away, it’s you, the person, I want to exchange with.

I'm interested in both a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items, and a digital e-mail exchange. Due to the private nature of penpalling, however, I want us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let’s become familiar with each other to make sure we’re a good fit. I'm open to an e-mail exchange more readily.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open when the mood strikes and with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I’m designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, hence the lure of elongated methods of communication.

Incremental exchange and a mutual creation is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it’s too fluid to be defined. I sort of have a thing for making connections work that otherwise shouldn't.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young. I’m most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I’m always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I so probably have more I take for granted.

When I went to Costco last week, I saw an array of people in a black shirt and jeans walk down an aisle at Costco together. I remembered someone saying that they had a similar experience but I have no idea what any person would achieve by coordinating outfits. Is it meant to scare someone?

Then, I went into town today for an appointment. On the way there, I went to a chick fil a that was about an hour away from my house and saw these two young guys. I remembered one of them because he looks like an actor from this show I watch. That’s the only reason he kind of caught my attention for a moment because for a second, I really thought it was him! Then, about three hours later, I went to a small coffee shop. The two guys walk in while I’m ordering my coffee. They make eye contact. 

Not sure what I’m trying to get out of this post. Just maybe someone reaching out and telling me their experiences so I can feel less alone ",1,1765417759.0,Gangstalking,0,0.67,False

1pjl4ja,https://www.reddit.com/r/BNHA_OC_Characters/comments/1pjl4ja/seigo_bio/,Seigo bio,"**Full name**: Seigo Kansaki

**Hero name:** Psion

**Age:** 36

**Birthday:** February 17th

**Zodiac sign:** Aquarius

**Blood type:** O-

**Quirk:** Psionics

**Occupation: Pro Hero (full time), Heroics Professor, Member of the FAoH**

**Physical Appearance-**

**Description:** Seigo is a lean, toned man with rosy toned skin, white, fluffy long hair with light blue streaks tied into a low ponytail, and light gray eyes with a light blue ring in the center. His features are cat like and sharp, and he has a “third eye” marking on his forehead that’s usually covered by his bangs (serves no purpose but glows blue when he uses his quirk). When using his quirk, his hair begins floating and glows a bright white, and his eyes turn completely light blue and glowing with an inner white iris in the middle. He has glasses that he wears for farsightedness while teaching. He has a swirly black tattoo on his shoulder.

[Seigo’s reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNHA_OC_Characters/s/3hiEQbRn4M)

**Height:** 5’9

**Weight:** 189lbs

**Quirk-**

**Description:** Psionics (プシオニクス) is a quirk that allows Seigo to manipulate psychic energy to his will, most often appearing as physical energy constructs. He can also use ESP and telekinesis to a degree, and uses a Psionic ring to teleport short distances. His quirk is a combination between Ayumu’s telepath quirk and Bionic’s technopathy quirk.

**Type:** Emitter

**Pros:**

\- Versatile and can be used in many ways

\- Can create any construct he envisions, can quickly switch forms if needed

\- Has exhibited signs of precognition, handy in foiling potential terror plots

**Cons:**

\- When overused or overworked, Seigo will experience severe headaches and nosebleeds, putting him out of commission for the time being

\- His Psionic Ring has no set location point, meaning he can’t control where he teleports

\- As he gets older, his limit for how long he can use his quirk has decreased, he has to time when he uses it to prevent overuse. Doctors have expressed worries that if he goes over his limit, he will experience a brain bleed or anuyersm, which would not be ideal

**Stats-**

**Strength:** 3/5

**Speed:** 3/5

**Control:** 4/5

**Technique:** 5/5

**Duration:** 2/5

**Bio-**

**Backstory:** Seigo was born to a wealthy family in Tokyo and was the only son of a high ranking socialite, Ayumu Kansaki and the Number 3 Pro Hero Bionic. Having studied at UA in his teen years, he was transferred to Nouveau Wings Academy after Bionic’s death from a villian attack.

It was discovered that Ayumu had joined a secret society known as the French Association of Heroism, her high ranking status within Japan’s Hero Society shooting her up on the ranks making her the President of the organization. Seigo was essentially forced to join, his mother’s growing ego and toxicity making her hard to refuse.

At NW Academy, he was arranged into a marriage with Celie Termelin, the daughter of France’s No.1 Hero, Skyward. The two surprisingly connected over the high pressures that their parents enforced on them, and they grew a deeper bond despite only being forced together for quirk breeding purposes and publicity.

They eventually had a son, Naguyo, who they later found out was quirkless, however, scans would show that he had one joint in his pinky toe, meaning his quirk was either developmentally delayed or that something was stopping it from manifesting.

Ayumu was enraged, disowning her grandson and demanding that all records of his existence be wiped, making him a nobody in the eyes of the society. Seigo became hellbent on finding the cause of his sons quirklessness, even looking into his mothers past, trying to dig up a possible cause to no avail.

They also had a daughter a year later named Charlotte, who would end up manifesting a teleportation quirk. Even to this day, Seigo is determined to find a cure to Naguyo’s condition, rejecting his mothers requests to throw him out of the family every time. At the time of the story, Celie has just given birth to a baby girl, Yumi, and Seigo has been a heroics professor at NW Academy for 5 years.

**Family:** Ayumu (mother), Bionic (father; deceased), Celie (wife), Naguyo (son), Charlotte (daughter), Yumi (daughter), Skyward (father in law)

**General info-**

**Likes:** Crepes, dogs, meditating, gag gifts, his wife and kids, bad parody movies, morning jogs, his wife and kids again, coffee, finishing his work, did I mention his wife and kids?

**Dislikes:** Working for the FAoH, his mother, his son being bullied, vomit (major etemophobe), slow walkers, disruptive students, not being able to get to the bottom of his sons condition

**Personality:** Seigo is a relaxed, chill, and easygoing man who has a tendency to joke around, something that embarasses Naguyo and Lottie. Due to the new baby, he has a degree of baby fever and tends to dote over her alot, bragging about her to his students and colleagues. Although when the situation calls for it, Seigo can be serious to an extent, usually when dealing with Ayumu or a possible mass casualty event.

He dotes over his children a ton, especially Naguyo, and will fight tooth and nail to protect them. After finding out Naguyo suffers from severe bullying at Nouveau Wings, he loses his temper with the aggressors and demands them to be suspended. He also has a tendency to flirt with Celie alot, something she reciprocates.

He’s incredibly stubborn, and won’t give up on something until he knows it’s not an issue anymore, something that tends to worry Celie as he will neglect his own needs over getting to the bottom of others problems.

**Sexuality:** Pansexual

**Voice Actor:** Joshua Waters (EN), Akira Ishida (JP)

**Trivia-**

\- He inherits most of his fathers quirk, Nanobot Manifestation, which is responsible for the ring of psionic energy he uses to create constructs and teleport through. The psionic aspect of his quirk comes from his mother (who alledgedly has a Telepathy quirk… however there’s hints his quirk might be a mutation due to something Ayumu is hiding)

\- Seigo ranks just below his mother in the French Association of Heroism, being the “secretary” of the society. He doesn’t enjoy the job, but Ayumu has made it clear that he and his wife will join it or she gets them blacklisted from France’s hero society

\- He’s France’s number 18 pro hero on the billboard

\- He suffers from etemophobia due to an incident in his childhood where he ended up getting sick at a banquet in front of everyone, something Ayumu had ended up chastising him harshly for.

\- His most well known weapon construct are dual sai

\- Had to learn extensive martial arts to defeat villians more effectively, as his quirk isn’t the best for close combat on it’s own",2,1765417591.0,BNHA_OC_Characters,0,1.0,False

———

Norna didn’t speak for while as she followed Lucifer she just couldn’t, she temporarily lost that ability for a bit she was so flustered. 
She looked over at the altar curiously,she couldn’t help but notice and love that it held some similarities to the ones she has for her own gods back home. With the fair linen that was spread neatly over it and a nice display of candles on it.She looked up at the perfect rows of endless pews in front of them in the chancel before slowly turning to look around entirely. Just marvelling over its old and meticulously detailed statues that surrounded them and the beautifully crafted stained glass that left a kaleidoscope of colour on the walls, illuminated by the sun. This place was unlike anything she had ever set foot in on Midgard,even she could sense an ethereal presence here that can’t be overlooked. How people who’ve never been to been to heaven managed to captured a glimpse of it from merely a book and passion is incredible. But it’s a great passion even she can relate towards her gods. It’s crazy and kinda sad that the list of similarities grew between the two practices yet they’re still worlds apart.When she finally faced Lucifer her face went bright red, her eyes again taking in his appearance.Blissfully bringing her back to reality, she smiled shyly, he’s just too gorgeous for his own good. While still giddy over the nickname at least she had enough time to find her voice again“It’s really pretty” she said, almost begrudgingly. She hated to say it, but it’s the truth, this place is truly breathtaking. The whole cathedral is an entire altar of art.

And here is my more shorter and common response.

————-

Tony laughed “Can’t tell you that! It’s supposed to be secret” he teased, the corners of his mouth curling with a mischievous charming smirk. If only Ava knew. He’s the furthest from working with the FEDS. He’s their worst nightmare. A phantom in a tailored suit, who basically has the city lassoed in a chain made of his threats and bloodstained promises. The kind of man whispered about in precincts, like a monster parents scare their kids straight with “So what’s new with you?” He asked, trying to steer the subject away from his work.

Hopefully these replies are okay with you.

These are my plot suggestions. Most of these are not set in stone what AU/time period they take place, we can tweak them however much you want I’m always open for new ideas. And we certainly do **NOT** have to do them if you don’t want they’re merely suggestions. If you have any of your own please share away

# 15
Muse A Is a mob boss. And everyone in the small village knows them but fears them too much, they have too much political influence that cops won’t touch them. It’s known they go to confession every Saturday as a habit, they’ve been doing so since they were able to see over the altar. But when the priest dies of old age a younger priest,Muse B takes over the parish. Prepared for everything but the criminal confessions he’s about to hear every Saturday like clock work.

I've never had a Pache before. This seems like another super small microlot.**

Some info about the farm. They're best known for their Geshas, but obviously got other varieties too:

**Mount Totumas Coffee won 1st Place at the 2023 Best of Panama in the Geisha Natural category** and maintained an impressive standing as 6th Place Geisha Natural Auction Lot in 2024.

Established in 2008 by the Dietrich brothers, Jeff and Michael, initially as a an off-the-grid, rustic luxe, cloud forest lodge on 140 hectares bordering Central America’s largest highland national park, La Amistad, Mount Totumas was encouraged toward high-end coffee cultivation by neighboring fincas with decades of expertise in producing award-winning Panama Geisha, evinced by decorated track records in the Best of Panama.

**Mentored by Ratibor and Tessie Hartmann of the acclaimed Finca Hartmann family legacy**, the Dietrich family planted their first 500 Panama Geisha trees in 2014. To date, they have 10,000 coffee trees including Caturra, Catuai, and Typica flourishing at altitudes 1800 masl and higher, amid the legendary, biodiverse, and canopied Chiriqui terroir.

Under the leadership of Jeff’s daughter, Karin de la Rosa who steers operations according to their philosophy of holistic, ecologically-oriented specialty coffee production, as well as the support of his wife Alma, Mount Totumas is poised to continue playing an important part in endearing the most discerning connoisseurs to the Panama Geisha.",0,1765417224.0,pourover,0,0.5,False

Here’s a sample of what my longer replies can look like to give you an idea of what to expect. No pressure if you don’t have any samples 

———

Norna didn’t speak for while as she followed Lucifer she just couldn’t, she temporarily lost that ability for a bit she was so flustered. 
She looked over at the altar curiously,she couldn’t help but notice and love that it held some similarities to the ones she has for her own gods back home. With the fair linen that was spread neatly over it and a nice display of candles on it.She looked up at the perfect rows of endless pews in front of them in the chancel before slowly turning to look around entirely. Just marvelling over its old and meticulously detailed statues that surrounded them and the beautifully crafted stained glass that left a kaleidoscope of colour on the walls, illuminated by the sun. This place was unlike anything she had ever set foot in on Midgard,even she could sense an ethereal presence here that can’t be overlooked. How people who’ve never been to been to heaven managed to captured a glimpse of it from merely a book and passion is incredible. But it’s a great passion even she can relate towards her gods. It’s crazy and kinda sad that the list of similarities grew between the two practices yet they’re still worlds apart.When she finally faced Lucifer her face went bright red, her eyes again taking in his appearance.Blissfully bringing her back to reality, she smiled shyly, he’s just too gorgeous for his own good. While still giddy over the nickname at least she had enough time to find her voice again“It’s really pretty” she said, almost begrudgingly. She hated to say it, but it’s the truth, this place is truly breathtaking. The whole cathedral is an entire altar of art.

———

And here is my more shorter and common response.

————-

Tony laughed “Can’t tell you that! It’s supposed to be secret” he teased, the corners of his mouth curling with a mischievous charming smirk. If only Ava knew. He’s the furthest from working with the FEDS. He’s their worst nightmare. A phantom in a tailored suit, who basically has the city lassoed in a chain made of his threats and bloodstained promises. The kind of man whispered about in precincts, like a monster parents scare their kids straight with “So what’s new with you?” He asked, trying to steer the subject away from his work.

Hopefully these replies are okay with you.

These are my plot suggestions. Most of these are not set in stone what AU/time period they take place, we can tweak them however much you want I’m always open for new ideas. And we certainly do **NOT** have to do them if you don’t want they’re merely suggestions. If you have any of your own please share away

I am 24F, up until recently I identified as a lesbian. I am now identifying as queer bc idk I’m open to whatever. I was also in a 4 year relationship with a woman until the beginning of October. The breakup coincided with me reconnecting with a friend from college who is 24NB (AMAB). 

We started hang out a lot and over a few weeks I started to realize I was having feelings for them. And I genuinely thought they were mutual because we were both pretty physically affectionate, there was some flirting, we hung out like every day, etc etc. I assumed they were just being respectful of the breakup. Even our mutual friends all seemed to think they were interested. 

I’ve been ramping myself up to tell them how I’ve been feeling, and I had planned tell them Monday night after an event we went to together. 

But last week I barely heard from them, which was weird because we’d been talking everyday. And then over the weekend we ran into each other and we were both in dates. 

My reason for going on the date: I’m newly single and wanted to see how it felt especially since I wasn’t sure if my friend liked me back. 

Then Monday as I was getting ready for the event they called me and told me they were feeling anxious because the girl they went on a date with hugged another guy in front of them. And they wanted to talk about it. This is when I learned they have known this girl for an about a year. Shes a barista at a coffee shop they go to a lot. But the first time they hung out was last Thursday, and the second time was Saturday when I ran into them. 

Idk why but I couldn’t bring myself to stop the conversation and say “hey, I just need you to know I like you. It’s ok that you don’t feel the same way I just might not be the right person to talk about this with.” I mean I do know why. I didn’t want to make things weird and I want to be a supportive friend. So I talked to them for about a half hour about this girl.

We went to the event, had a great time. Afterwards we got into a pretty deep conversation about how they feel unsure if they deserve love and how they seek out unhealthy relationships. That they’re worried that this new girl will abandon them if they show her who they really are. And that they don’t know how they’d handle it if she was seeing other people or didn’t want to see them anymore. 

And I still didn’t say anything. I’m honestly so down bad bc I just kept saying and thinking “if she doesn’t know how incredible you are she’s not the right person for you.” But I also cut in with “but it also seems like you’re just feeling anxious and you really like her”. 

I’m really struggling with this bc I honestly really really like my friend. But I don’t want to make things weird, I don’t want to get in the way of something they’re excited about, and I don’t want to ruin our friendship. But at the same time, I feel like I might regret it if I don’t say anything. The more time I spend with them and the better I get to know them, the harder I fall.

1pjkpxh,https://i.redd.it/q16t3r3c9h6g1.png,I just launched my personal development web app today. Worked on it with Lovable and deployed with Vercel. Would love to hear what you think! www.intentionco-app.com,"Hey everyone! Today’s a big day for me. After 7 months of building, breaking things, rebuilding, and drinking way too much coffee, the INTENTION CO. personal development web app that connects to my clothing brand is officially live: [www.intentionco-app.com](http://www.intentionco-app.com). 

It’s not perfect. It’s not finished. But it’s ready, and I’d love to invite anyone here to try it out.

The app consists of the following:

It’s a personal development hub built around 5 pillars:

* Journaling: AI generates meaningful prompts based on your goals  
* Habits: shows what you’re doing well + where you can improve  
* Meditation: simple guided sessions + AI reflections  
* Manifestation: creates personalized scripts based on your goals  
* Deep Work: distraction-free focus sessions + tracking  

When you sign up, the app asks you 5 core questions about your goals and aspirations and then personalizes your experience around them.

You should definitely try it if you are someone who:

* Wants one place for all their productivity + self-growth routines  
* Journals, tracks habits, meditates, or works on long-term goals  
* Struggles with consistency and want something more intentional  
* Likes personal development but hates juggling 3-5 different apps  
* Are a fan of intentional living, wellness, mindfulness, and self-improvement  

If you’re into bettering yourself, this was literally built for you. 

This is how it connects to my clothing brand:

The app is tied to my brand INTENTION CO., which is all about intentional living.  
  


To make the ecosystem fun:

* Every app user gets clothing discounts  
* Premium users receive a free clothing item every 3 months (something for the future)  

It’s a way to connect the digital routines with a real-world community and identity. Clothing works as a daily reminder to live intentionally, everyday. And the pieces are really nice too.

I’m launching publicly because I want real feedback. Don’t hold anything back.  
Some things will feel rough. Some ideas may need rethinking. That’s exactly what I want to hear.

If you join today, can you tell me…

1. What was your first impression?  
2. Did anything feel confusing or unnecessary?  
3. What did you like the most?  
4. What would instantly make it better?  
5. Would you keep using it? Why or why not?  

Your feedback right now matters more than you know, and you can literally shape the future of this platform.

If you do try it, thank you. And if you comment, roast, critique, or suggest new ideas, then I’ll thank you even more.

It's manipulation dressed up as virtue.

Honesty doesn't mean unfiltered. You can be truthful without being an asshole. You can deliver hard truths with compassion and tact.

But people who lead with ""I'm just being honest"" aren't interested in that. They want to say whatever they want and avoid accountability by framing it as a moral good.

It's the same energy as ""no offense, but..."" a disclaimer that gives them permission to be offensive.

Real honesty doesn't need a warning label. It doesn't require you to announce that you're about to hurt someone. If you have to preface your statement with ""I'm just being honest"" you already know what you're about to say is unnecessarily harsh.

Honesty is about truth. ""Just being honest"" is about control.

I was having coffee this morning after someone used that exact phrase to justify saying something cruel and I realized how often it gets weaponized.

If someone truly values honesty they'll find a way to be truthful and kind. If they only care about the truth when it benefits them or hurts you, that's not honesty it's just meanness with better PR.",358,1765416301.0,YouShouldKnow,33,0.82,False

I wouldn’t even open my notes until the night before, then pull an all-nighter in pure panic. I couldn’t stop scrolling, watching random videos, or just... avoiding reality. I knew it was bad, but I didn’t know how to *actually* change it.

This year though, something finally clicked — and I wanted to share what helped in case anyone else is going through the same thing:

What changed for me:.

**I turned off my phone and didn’t charge it.** If it’s not at 100%, I can’t scroll for hours. That tiny bit of friction helped more than I thought.

**I prepared snacks and coffee in advance.** If I’m hungry or craving something, it gives me an excuse to stop. Now I prep everything before I start — no excuses.

**I deleted the “big 3” apps.** You know which ones. That alone probably gave me back 50% of my attention span.

**I stopped waiting to “feel ready” or “motivated.”** I realized that feeling never comes. I started setting a 10-minute timer and just opening the damn book. Most of the time, once I started, I kept going.

**I made review insanely small and specific.** Like “review 2 slides” instead of “study for exam.” My brain couldn’t argue with something that tiny.

**I reminded myself how awful panic-cramming feels.** I used to think “I can just cram later,” but now I replay that horrible night-before feeling in my head — it keeps me honest

I still get distracted sometimes, but I don’t spiral for days like I used to. Studying feels a little less like punishment and a little more like self-respect now.

1pjkljf,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1pjkljf/having_a_crush_on_a_female_after_a_long_time/,Having a crush on a female after a long time.,"Hi, I'm(24F) hoping this is a safe space and I can get some genuine advice. I see this is a ""lesbian"" subreddit but I hope it's okay I ask for advice as someone thats most likely bisexual. 

So, the last time I was attracted to a woman was in high school, around the end of 11th grade. Definitely very confusing time, mostly kept it to myself but when I like someone Im not very discreet either. A few people found out, including her(lesbian). Feelings were not mutual, moving on... since then ive just been focused on guys, trying to date men, never works out. Never really tried to look at woman in that way since high school. I feel like im giving unnecessary context but hopefully it makes sense. 

I have been developing an interest in someone at work. We don't work closely together, we're in different departments. Im not sure when the attraction started, maybe 1-2 months ago, when I embarrassingly tried to help an older lady push a heavy cart into a walk-in freezer and the handle broke off and 15+ boxes fell off, her standing a feet away watch it happen, chuckled and starts helping to pick them up(ik, im fuxkin lame to think this is cute enough to think about). We don't have conversations, we've only said HI when passing but I find her extremely attractive. I can't even look at her, not wanting her to know I'm interested or think im staring or I'm scared I will start staring. Yesterday, I bought her a drink and told the barista(that works in the same building) not to tell her its from me when she comes to buy her coffee. She asked who's it from, worried its from a creep, she was relieved to know it's from a woman. I think i made it weird lol should I have approached it differently? Maybe just got it and handed it to her? Left a note? 


Ps. Since this realization, I have not been interested in having a relationship with a guy. Still attracted to men. Not sure what this all means.

I guess my question is 
what should I do?
How do I find out if this is something I should go for?
How to flirt with woman?

Edit: thank you for that comment about referring woman as females. I did not mean it in a demeaning, dehumanizing way at all. I sincerely apologize🙏",0,1765416091.0,LesbianActually,3,0.5,False
