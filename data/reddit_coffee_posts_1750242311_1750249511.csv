On June 17, 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the launch of the Commissioner’s National Priority Voucher (CNPV) program—a move that, in my view, marks a genuinely important shift in how new medicines will reach the U.S. market. While most regulatory news gets ignored by the mainstream, I think this announcement deserves a close look—especially for aTyr Pharma ($ATYR) shareholders, given where Efzofitimod sits in the development cycle.

The CNPV program is a new, pilot framework that could dramatically accelerate FDA reviews for drugs that align with U.S. “national priorities”—whether that means tackling unmet public health needs, delivering innovative new therapies, or enhancing domestic manufacturing. Unlike the usual expedited review pathways (Fast Track, Priority Review, etc.), the CNPV aims to cut the typical 10–12 month review timeline down to just 1–2 months for eligible drugs, using a focused, multidisciplinary team review. This isn’t just an administrative tweak—it has the potential to fundamentally change the timelines and de-risking cycles that shape biotech value creation.

For aTyr Pharma investors, the timing could hardly be more interesting. With Efzofitimod approaching its pivotal Phase 3 readout in pulmonary sarcoidosis (a rare disease with no approved targeted therapies), the possibility of accessing this new voucher system means that what is usually a long, uncertain regulatory wait could be compressed into a matter of weeks. In my opinion, understanding what this new program is, and how it’s likely to be implemented, is now a central part of the $ATYR setup.

This post is a long-form, institutional-grade deep dive into what the CNPV program actually is, how it works, and why it matters for Efzofitimod and retail holders of $ATYR. I’ll break down the new rules, compare them to the old ones, explain the likely magnitude (high/medium/low) of their impact at each stage, and—above all—frame everything around real-world relevance for shareholders. My goal is to demystify the mechanics, provide context on what this means for risk/reward, and share my view on where this could go next. As always, I’ll avoid hype, keep the tone grounded, and make sure key concepts are clearly explained for those less familiar with the regulatory landscape.

**Buy Me a Coffee**  
I work very hard to bring you these deep dive breakdowns. Some days I receive no benefit at all. In fact, last night, after posting the two-part series on institutional ownership, I received a princely sum of $10 in contributions for all those hours of research, analysis, and synthesis. And that’s fine—I do it for the community, and for the love of the work. But to keep this sustainable, I need your help. If you’re finding value here, just ask yourself, what is this worth to you?

As always, none of this is investment advice—just one investor’s view, synthesizing the best available information as of June 18, 2025.

Ok, let’s get into it.

## 1. What Did the FDA Just Announce? The CNPV in Plain English—And Why It’s Not ‘Just Another Fast Track’

**Timeline and Facts: What Happened on June 17, 2025**

On June 17, 2025, the FDA introduced the Commissioner’s National Priority Voucher (CNPV) program—a pilot initiative designed to dramatically accelerate reviews for therapies that address pressing U.S. health priorities. Unlike routine regulatory updates, this came with a clear mandate from Commissioner Marty Makary: cut red tape, focus on what matters, and speed up access for drugs that fill major unmet needs. In practice, the CNPV program is initially limited to just a handful of vouchers in 2025, underscoring its exclusivity and competitive nature.

**How the CNPV Works—A Practical Walkthrough**

CNPVs are vouchers awarded to companies developing therapies for national priorities—such as rare diseases, innovative cures, major public health threats, or drugs produced in the U.S. Recipients who qualify will have their new drug application reviewed in 1–2 months (rather than the typical 10–12), following a collaborative, “tumor board” style FDA meeting. To apply, companies must submit detailed manufacturing and readiness documents (CMC) at least 60 days in advance, and remain in close, ongoing contact with the FDA. Only those that are fully prepared, with compelling data and manufacturing readiness, stand a chance.

Vouchers are non-transferable: only the sponsor who earns it can use it, and only during the pilot phase. If a company fails to meet the ongoing requirements or readiness milestones, the voucher can be rescinded.

**How CNPV Differs From Existing FDA Pathways**

- **Fast Track:** Offers more frequent meetings and rolling submissions, but doesn’t guarantee a fast final review.
- **Priority Review:** Cuts the standard review to 6 months, but still follows the traditional, sequential review by FDA divisions.
- **Old PRVs (Priority Review Vouchers):** Previously could be sold, often tied to pediatric or tropical diseases; these are now largely phased out.

The CNPV is unique in its combination of:
- *Direct national priority targeting* (not just disease severity, but also public health relevance and supply chain considerations);
- *Radically shortened, team-based review* (1–2 months, all divisions together);
- *Pilot-phase exclusivity* (only a few will be issued this year, with no secondary market);
- *High operational bar* (readiness, not just data, is required).

**Why This Matters for aTyr Pharma ($ATYR) Right Now**

For aTyr, the timing and structure are particularly meaningful. Efzofitimod’s pivotal Phase 3 readout for pulmonary sarcoidosis—a disease with no approved targeted treatments—is expected late Q3 2025, directly overlapping with the CNPV pilot window. aTyr already has Orphan and Fast Track status, a global Phase 3 trial nearly complete, and has flagged manufacturing readiness. In my view, this makes them one of the rare few that could plausibly apply immediately upon positive data.

For shareholders, this isn’t just another update in a long regulatory slog. The CNPV could—if secured—shrink the period of regulatory risk from years to weeks. That can mean an earlier, higher, and sharper rerating of risk and value for $ATYR, with direct implications for everything from institutional ownership to potential strategic bids. The scale and timing of this regulatory shift, in my opinion, put aTyr and Efzofitimod in a unique position for value acceleration if the data deliver.

## 2. Why Does This Matter? Real-World Meaning for aTyr Shareholders

When you look at the historical playbook for value creation in biotech, especially for rare disease companies like aTyr Pharma, one pattern stands out: real, durable re-ratings don’t happen in a straight line from good data. They are almost always catalyzed by key “unlock” events—where an external structural barrier (usually regulatory) is removed and the market is forced to rapidly reassess both the risk profile and the time value of future revenues. In my opinion, this is the lens through which every serious $ATYR shareholder—retail or institutional—needs to view the new FDA CNPV program.

### Regulatory Bottlenecks as Valuation Anchors

Most retail investors focus on clinical results, market size, or competitive positioning. All are critical, but none are more deterministic for near-term price action than the tempo and clarity of the regulatory process. In practice, the entire pre-commercial biotech sector trades at a steep, persistent discount to intrinsic value, and that discount is directly correlated with two things: (1) time-to-approval, and (2) uncertainty over the approval process itself.

Here’s why that matters for aTyr right now. Efzofitimod’s story is not about technical risk anymore; most key opinion leaders, the company itself, and a significant chunk of the market are in consensus about the drug’s efficacy and safety (as supported by positive Phase 2 data, four clean DSMB reviews, and growing management confidence). What keeps the valuation anchored is the “dead space” between the end of Phase 3 and the uncertain, protracted FDA review timeline. This dead space introduces opportunity cost (capital locked up for years), heightens the risk of sector rotation, and limits the breadth of institutional participation. Portfolio managers—especially at funds that benchmark against biotech indices, or those with internal capital charge rates—may simply not have the mandate or the patience to allocate to a story that could sit idle for 12–18 months, even if they believe in the science.

As a result, you can have a case where the fundamental value is multiples higher than the market cap, but the *realization* of that value is gated entirely by process. This is not just a drag on share price; it’s a cap on deal flow, strategic optionality, and even negotiating power if M&A comes into play.

### Magnitude Analysis: Why the CNPV is a High-Impact Variable

In my view, the CNPV is not “just another expedited review” box to tick. It is structurally different, and that difference is central to the $ATYR thesis going forward.

- **High-Magnitude Derisking:** The very act of removing 10–12 months from the regulatory path is a fundamental derisking event. For most biotech investors—especially the risk and portfolio managers at major funds—time equals risk. When the path to approval is shortened and more deterministic, the discount rate collapses, and so does the gap between current market cap and DCF or peak-sales-based fair value. This is not a marginal uplift; it’s a re-rating event.

- **High-Magnitude Valuation Re-Rating:** If Efzofitimod receives a CNPV, I think you’d see rapid escalation in sell-side price targets and internal buy-side modeling. Sell-side analysts are often constrained in how much they can re-rate between catalysts, but a confirmed CNPV would give them license to move much faster—reflecting both increased confidence in approval probability and a near-term cash flow pull-forward. On the buy side, the risk-adjusted NPV jumps, and mandates that previously could not engage pre-approval can begin sizing positions aggressively. Historically, these re-ratings often happen in “step changes” rather than a slow grind—triggered by clear structural shifts like this.

- **High-Magnitude Speed-to-Market, Optionality, and Strategic Positioning:** The window between regulatory approval and competitor entry, or between approval and peak adoption, is where real alpha is generated. Getting there a year earlier not only means earlier revenue, but also locks in first-mover advantage, drives earlier awareness among prescribers and patients, and increases leverage in any strategic partnership or buyout negotiations. For a company like aTyr, which is already well-positioned with manufacturing agreements and a “de-risked” story per KOLs, this advantage compounds: more time in market before competition, more exclusivity, and more runway to execute on commercial plans before the next dilution or funding event.

- **Institutional and Analyst Behavior:** Institutions and analysts are extremely sensitive to regulatory tempo. The faster and clearer the timeline, the more likely funds are to initiate coverage, increase position sizing, and treat the company as a “near-commercial” rather than “speculative clinical” name. In practice, that means $ATYR could see its shareholder base shift from predominantly retail and speculative capital to a broader mix of fundamental and event-driven institutional holders—typically driving higher volume, tighter spreads, and more sustained price support.

### Why Timeline Compression Is So Critical for Retail Shareholders

For retail holders, there’s a tendency to under-appreciate just how much timeline compression changes both the shape and the steepness of price moves in microcap and small-cap biotech. When major derisking events are far off and uncertain, the price tends to drift—often failing to reflect even major wins (like clean Phase 2 or 3 data) until a tangible regulatory endpoint is in sight. When that endpoint is pulled forward—especially in a highly visible, regulator-endorsed manner—the mechanics of the market change overnight.

- **Earlier Derisking = Earlier Realization of the Bull Thesis:** When the time between readout and approval shrinks, retail holders get to see the thesis validated and capitalized on much sooner. This can have an outsized impact in a name with a low float and a passionate retail following (as we’ve seen on r/ATYR_Alpha and similar communities).

- **Accelerated Institutional Participation:** Large funds, indexers, and even some crossover investors (who often wait for regulatory clarity) now have a window where they *must* get exposure or risk missing the move. This can lead to stepwise moves in volume and price, as institutional buying power collides with limited supply.

- **Steeper Price Curves and Reduced “Opportunity Cost”:** Instead of waiting out a multi-year approval process, retail holders can see value crystallize much faster, making opportunity cost far less of a factor in holding through volatility. In my opinion, this shift is especially important for aTyr because the float is constrained, insider and strategic holdings are high, and the “delta” between current price and fair value is material.

---

In my view, the FDA’s CNPV announcement is not just another bureaucratic update—it is a direct challenge to the market’s traditional gating of biotech value, and for aTyr Pharma, it lands at exactly the right moment in the lifecycle. If Efzofitimod can secure a voucher, the impact is high-magnitude across all the critical vectors: derisking, valuation, time-to-market, and even the quality of the shareholder base. For retail holders, the translation is simple—this could mean seeing years’ worth of risk and upside realization compressed into a matter of months, not years. And in a market where time is capital, that’s not just “relevant”—it’s potentially transformational.

## 3. CNPV Criteria and the ‘Shortlist’—How (and Why) Efzofitimod Could Qualify

In my view, understanding exactly how the FDA will judge CNPV eligibility is critical for any aTyr Pharma ($ATYR) shareholder trying to map risk, upside, and timeline. The CNPV program is pitched as a “national priorities” initiative, but the fine print around what qualifies is both more nuanced and, in some ways, more open-ended than most fast-track or priority review programs. Let’s break down what these criteria really mean, and why Efzofitimod may stand out in the race for one of these limited vouchers.

### What Does “National Priority” Mean? A Deep Dive into CNPV Criteria

The FDA has outlined four main “national priority” domains for CNPV eligibility:

1. **Health Crises:** These are situations where public health is threatened at scale—think pandemics, opioid epidemics, or critical supply shortages. The FDA wants to use the CNPV as a rapid response tool to get game-changing drugs into circulation when urgent need exists.
2. **Unmet Public Health Needs:** This captures rare diseases, neglected conditions, and major chronic illnesses where no adequate therapies exist. Here, the bar is less about the size of the population and more about the lack of effective solutions and the impact on quality of life, morbidity, and system costs.
3. **Innovative Cures:** The FDA is explicitly targeting drugs with novel mechanisms, new biological targets, or “first-in-class” approaches. The intent is to speed up not just incremental advances, but step-changes in medical science—drugs that could rewrite the standard of care.
4. **National Security Manufacturing:** This means therapies manufactured domestically or with supply chains controlled within the U.S. The FDA is increasingly focused on reducing reliance on overseas production, especially after COVID-19 exposed how fragile international drug manufacturing can be.

For a therapy to land a CNPV, it needs to make a compelling case in one or more of these domains, with supporting evidence, regulatory designations, and a clear readiness to move swiftly to approval and launch.

### How Does Efzofitimod (aTyr) Map to These Criteria?

Let’s look at each of these through the lens of aTyr and Efzofitimod:

#### Unmet Need: Pulmonary Sarcoidosis as a Rare, Underserved Disease

Efzofitimod is being developed for pulmonary sarcoidosis—a rare, chronic, and often debilitating disease with no FDA-approved targeted treatments. Current options are limited to corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, which carry significant toxicity and are often poorly tolerated. This is a textbook case of an “unmet need”: around 200,000–250,000 patients in the U.S. (and many more worldwide) are forced to cycle through non-specific, side-effect-prone therapies for years.

The lack of even a single disease-modifying or steroid-sparing drug means Efzofitimod, if successful, could fill an enormous clinical vacuum. In my opinion, this puts it at the top tier of eligibility from an “unmet need” standpoint—a critical consideration for the FDA, particularly after the expiration of the pediatric PRV program (which has increased focus on rare and orphan diseases).

#### Innovation: First-in-Class NRP2 Modulation

One of the strongest aspects of the aTyr story is Efzofitimod’s mechanism of action. This is not a “me-too” molecule or a repurposed small molecule—it’s a first-in-class fusion protein targeting neuropilin-2 (NRP2), a novel pathway implicated in both inflammation and fibrosis. A recent 2025 *Science Translational Medicine* publication has validated the NRP2 mechanism in preclinical and clinical settings, and the Phase 2 results have demonstrated both efficacy and safety.

Why does this matter for CNPV? Because the FDA is under pressure to accelerate not just “new” drugs, but genuinely innovative ones—those that could set new standards of care, especially in neglected indications. Efzofitimod’s unique biology and KOL support around its novel mechanism position it as exactly the kind of candidate the CNPV is supposed to serve.

#### Regulatory Designations: Orphan, Fast Track—and Why They Matter

Efzofitimod holds both Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) and Fast Track Designation (FTD) for pulmonary sarcoidosis. Orphan designation reflects both the rarity and severity of the disease, while Fast Track acknowledges the drug’s potential to address serious, unmet medical needs.

These designations are not just “nice badges”—they signal to the FDA that a program is both scientifically and operationally advanced, with strong clinical rationale and a sponsor ready to engage at speed. More importantly, they pave the way for additional expedited pathways (like CNPV) and demonstrate to review boards that aTyr has already cleared key eligibility hurdles. In my opinion, the presence of both ODD and FTD should put Efzofitimod at the top of the FDA’s list when considering which drugs are truly transformative.

#### Operational Readiness: Manufacturing, CMC, and Global Trial Completion

An underappreciated aspect of CNPV eligibility is the company’s operational readiness—particularly its ability to meet chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) requirements, which must be submitted well before final BLA/approval. aTyr has already completed a global, fully enrolled Phase 3 trial (EFZO-FIT™), with 268 patients across 85 centers, and has hired senior technical leaders and manufacturing experts, signaling that CMC processes are advanced.

Why is this important? Because CNPVs are not just handed out for good science—they’re reserved for programs that can translate good science into real-world impact quickly. The FDA does not want to grant a voucher only for a company to spend years catching up on manufacturing or regulatory paperwork. In my view, aTyr’s forward-leaning approach to manufacturing and CMC is not just a box-ticking exercise, but a critical strategic differentiator. It could be the difference between landing a voucher and missing out due to timing or execution risk.

### Magnitude Analysis: What If Efzofitimod Checks All the Boxes?

If Efzofitimod ticks the core CNPV boxes—rare, high-burden disease, first-in-class innovation, strong regulatory credentials, and manufacturing readiness—the potential impact for aTyr is, in my opinion, “high magnitude.” This would not just expedite the timeline to revenue, but could materially re-rate the entire investment case for $ATYR. It means moving from “clinical promise” to “near-term commercial reality,” with all the strategic, financial, and market impacts that come with that.

That said, it’s worth remembering that the CNPV is a pilot program with a limited pool of vouchers and (likely) fierce competition from oncology, infectious diseases, and other high-profile indications. The process is still somewhat discretionary and politicized—so nothing is guaranteed. But from a criteria and readiness perspective, I believe Efzofitimod belongs on the shortlist, and that’s a position with real asymmetric upside.

---

## 4. The Competitive and Sector Context—Who Else Is in the Race, and What Could Go Wrong?

Understanding the potential impact of the CNPV for aTyr requires a sober look at the competitive landscape and structural risks. As promising as the program sounds, it’s neither a blank cheque nor a guarantee—and for every rare disease therapy eyeing a voucher, there are dozens of other companies and disease areas jockeying for a spot on the shortlist. In my view, how these dynamics unfold could shape the size and speed of any upside for Efzofitimod, and also the resilience of the $ATYR story if the company misses out.

### Competition for Vouchers: Who Is the Real Peer Group?

One of the underappreciated challenges for CNPV applicants is the strength and diversity of the competition. The FDA has kept the criteria deliberately broad, meaning that the pool of potential candidates is far wider than just a handful of rare disease drugs approaching pivotal data.

- **Oncology**: Cancer drugs remain the “headline acts” for expedited review. They have well-organized patient advocacy groups, generally robust data packages, and high public profile. The FDA has a track record of moving aggressively on transformative cancer therapies, especially in areas like CAR-T, antibody-drug conjugates, and “tumor-agnostic” drugs.
- **Infectious Diseases**: The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed how the FDA prioritizes infectious disease threats. Companies developing vaccines, antivirals, or antibiotics for emerging pathogens could leapfrog the queue, especially if there’s a perceived national security angle.
- **Other Rare Diseases**: The lapse of the pediatric PRV program in late 2024 has left a vacuum for rare disease drugs seeking expedited review. The field is now wide open, with dozens of small and mid-cap biotechs presenting programs in neurological, metabolic, and genetic conditions.
- **Domestic Manufacturing Tie-Ins**: Companies that can clearly demonstrate U.S.-based production, particularly for supply chain–critical drugs, may find themselves favored regardless of indication.

In my opinion, Efzofitimod is a strong contender given its first-in-class profile, large underserved patient population, and the KOL support already documented. However, the presence of large, well-capitalized peers in cancer and infectious disease, often with stronger lobbying resources, means aTyr’s candidacy—while credible—is far from unopposed.

### FDA Discretion and Transparency: “Moving Goalposts” and Advocacy Realities

One feature of the CNPV pilot that bears close attention is the high degree of discretion left to the FDA Commissioner and review panels. Unlike traditional pathways, which have codified scoring systems and public review calendars, the CNPV relies on a more subjective, “tumor board” approach. This means priorities can shift rapidly based on leadership changes, public health headlines, or external pressures.

- **“Moving Goalposts”**: In practice, this means today’s stated priorities (e.g., rare diseases) could tomorrow be overshadowed by a new pandemic, political pressure, or public health crisis. The pilot nature of the CNPV means even the rules could be re-written in real time.
- **KOL and Patient Advocacy Influence**: In this environment, KOLs, patient groups, and high-visibility media campaigns can move the needle. Programs with vocal advocacy may see their cases elevated, while those without strong external champions risk being deprioritized—even with compelling data. For aTyr, strong relationships with leading clinicians and sarcoidosis advocacy groups could be a key differentiator, but it would be prudent to assume the field is unpredictable.

For aTyr shareholders, these are not “company-specific” risks, but sector-wide risks that could alter the trajectory of all potential CNPV beneficiaries.

### Magnitude Analysis: What If aTyr Misses Out?

In my opinion, while the upside to a successful CNPV award is high-magnitude, the downside of missing out is more medium-term in nature. Efzofitimod’s fundamental value proposition—addressing a large unmet need with first-in-class innovation—remains unchanged. The traditional BLA and review path, while slower, is still valid, and aTyr’s operational momentum (and potential for partnership or acquisition) is not predicated solely on CNPV success.

For retail investors, this means that while timeline compression is highly attractive, missing out on a voucher does not “break” the aTyr story. It simply extends the risk period and could defer value realization by several quarters. For those with a longer time horizon, or who value aTyr for its broader pipeline and platform, the long-term thesis remains substantially intact—albeit with less near-term asymmetric upside.

---

## 5. Market Mechanics—Timeline Compression and the Real-World Path to Value for aTyr

When thinking about the impact of the CNPV program on aTyr, it’s essential to move beyond the regulatory headlines and focus on how changes in the approval timeline could fundamentally alter the company’s valuation trajectory—and, just as importantly, the pattern of stock price movements around major events. This is where the “rubber meets the road” for both institutional and retail holders, and, in my view, where the CNPV program is potentially most transformative.

### Pre-Catalyst Phase: The Mechanics of the Run-Up

In biotech, anticipation often drives more price action than the event itself. Ahead of pivotal readouts (such as aTyr’s Phase 3 EFZO-FIT results), we usually see a classic “run-up”—as hedge funds, sector specialists, and retail traders position for the binary outcome. 

The prospect of CNPV eligibility, in my opinion, adds fuel to this dynamic for several reasons:

- **Rising News Flow:** Companies in contention for CNPVs may get outsized media attention, with every update on the application process, FDA engagement, or patient advocacy being interpreted as a signal. This can amplify both pre-catalyst optimism and trading volumes.
- **Anticipatory Buying:** If aTyr is perceived as a CNPV frontrunner, funds that might otherwise wait for data may start building positions earlier, given the risk that news will come quickly and without time to react.
- **Retail FOMO:** Retail communities, particularly those tracking regulatory catalysts, could accelerate their buying, trying to “front-run” perceived institutional demand.

**Magnitude:** In my view, the magnitude of this pre-readout effect could be “medium–high,” particularly if aTyr is featured in FDA communications or picked up by biotech media as a likely voucher recipient. The timeline to “price discovery” may get pulled forward, with less of the traditional “wait and see” around the readout date itself.

### Post-Catalyst Phase: Pulling Value Forward and Re-Rating the Risk

Assuming positive Phase 3 data, the combination of de-risking and a credible path to ultra-rapid approval (via CNPV) has the potential to fundamentally shift the valuation and risk profile for aTyr—often in a very compressed window.

- **Derisking Effect:** With traditional pathways, investors typically wait for both data and several months of regulatory back-and-forth before assigning high multiples or significant upside. CNPV eligibility compresses this, allowing the market to “see through” the remaining steps more quickly.
- **Buyer Base Expansion:** More institutional capital (including long-only funds that usually avoid binary events) may enter earlier, driving stronger post-catalyst re-rating and higher volume.
- **Multiple Expansion:** Timeline compression often leads to a “pull forward” of future valuation. Markets start assigning value based on projected sales, M&A optionality, or platform potential much earlier, which can steepen the share price curve dramatically.

**Magnitude:** In my view, the impact here is “high”—especially for companies like aTyr that are otherwise exposed to multi-year “dead money” risk while waiting for approval. If the market believes that approval (and therefore cash flow, M&A interest, and strategic optionality) is coming within months rather than years, re-rating can be abrupt and significant.

### M&A and Buyout Optionality: The Strategic Premium of Speed

It’s important not to overlook the signaling effect that CNPV eligibility sends to potential acquirers or large-cap partners. In an industry where time-to-market is often the most valuable commodity, a company on the CNPV shortlist becomes a much more attractive target.

- **Accelerated Timelines:** For big pharma, knowing that a target can go from Phase 3 data to launch (and revenue) in a year instead of three fundamentally changes deal math and strategic calculus.
- **Competitive Tension:** If multiple players are watching aTyr, the perceived “window” for a cheap acquisition closes much faster, often leading to higher bid competition or more aggressive partnership terms.

**Magnitude:** In my opinion, the magnitude here is “high.” Strategic activity in biotech is highly sensitive to regulatory timelines, and being at the front of the CNPV queue could be a catalyst for bids or major collaborations that would not otherwise have materialized until much later in the cycle.

### Volatility, Shorts, and Retail: FOMO Cuts Both Ways

While accelerated timelines and news flow can drive significant upside, they can also increase volatility—especially for low-float names with retail followings.

- **Short Squeeze Risk:** With limited float and growing attention, a sudden positive CNPV update could trigger sharp, forced covering by shorts, adding to upside but also to wild intraday swings.
- **Retail Exuberance (and Risk):** The same forces that drive parabolic moves can also lead to rapid reversals if the narrative stumbles. For retail holders, it’s important to understand that the same news cycles that drive excitement can also drive corrections, especially as institutional traders rebalance or take profits.

Overall, in my view, timeline compression magnifies both the opportunity and the risk for aTyr holders. The potential for earlier, more dramatic value realization is real, but so too is the chance of amplified volatility and fast-changing sentiment. As always, understanding the interplay between regulatory progress, market mechanics, and investor psychology is key to navigating this landscape.

## 6. Risks, Limitations, and ‘What to Watch For’ as an $ATYR Shareholder

In my view, one of the most important things for $ATYR shareholders to recognise about the CNPV program is that, while the potential upside is significant, there are meaningful risks and variables that can shape how the story unfolds. It’s easy to get swept up in the “voucher chase,” but the reality—at least the way I see it—is more nuanced.

**Competition for Vouchers:**  
The CNPV initiative is attracting attention from across the biopharma landscape. Efzofitimod is, in my opinion, extremely well-positioned for a rare disease drug, but so are a number of late-stage oncology, infectious disease, and even neurodegenerative candidates that tick other “national priority” boxes. The FDA has a finite pool of vouchers and, based on what we know, their allocation will ultimately be at the Commissioner’s discretion. This means that even a textbook case can miss out if the landscape shifts, if another crisis emerges, or if there’s simply more political momentum behind another indication. In my experience, this kind of regulatory “weather” is hard to predict but worth respecting.

**Data Quality and Safety:**  
While I’m confident about the design and statistical powering of EFZO-FIT, it’s always possible for new safety signals or marginal efficacy to emerge at the eleventh hour. The CNPV program is clear that only “well-characterised” data will be considered. That means the data must be unambiguous, clean, and compelling. In my opinion, this raises the bar, but it also ensures that only genuinely breakthrough drugs are fast-tracked.

**Operational Readiness:**  
I also think aTyr’s operational discipline—evident in their global Phase 3 execution and CMC progress—is a core strength. But if there are any missteps in manufacturing scale-up or in the timely delivery of required documentation, that could cause delays or even disqualify a CNPV application. The new system is not forgiving of “work-in-progress” on the operational side. For shareholders, this is worth keeping front of mind: you can have world-class clinical data, but you also need industrial-grade execution.

**Regulatory and Policy Uncertainty:**  
The way I see it, any new pilot program carries the risk of policy change. The CNPV could be adjusted, paused, or reprioritized if early results aren’t as impactful as policymakers hope. The fact that it’s a Commissioner’s tool adds a layer of unpredictability—shifts in leadership or political winds can change outcomes quickly.

**If aTyr Misses Out:**  
In my opinion, if Efzofitimod does not secure a CNPV, it’s a setback, but not a fundamental one. Fast Track and Orphan Drug pathways are already in play, and the “value creation engine” for $ATYR—the prospect of bringing a genuinely first-in-class therapy to a major unmet need—remains unchanged. Missing a voucher means a more traditional approval timeline, not the loss of the core investment thesis. The impact, in my view, is “medium”—the path to value may be longer, but it is not closed off.

**Signals to Watch:**
- **FDA Program Updates:** I’d recommend monitoring FDA communications for any subtle changes to the CNPV program, language on selection criteria, or updates on awarded vouchers.
- **aTyr Investor Communications:** Keep an eye on company press releases and earnings calls, especially any mention of manufacturing (CMC), pre-submission meetings, or explicit references to voucher strategy.
- **KOLs and Advocacy:** In my experience, strong and visible support from medical KOLs and patient groups can influence regulatory attention—especially for rare diseases.
- **Market/Index Moves:** Large changes in institutional positions, block trades, or index rebalancing can sometimes signal market anticipation or reaction to CNPV news.
- **Sector Read-Through:** Watch how the first round of CNPV awards plays out. Are rare diseases actually being prioritised, or is the program weighted towards other indications?

## 7. Summary: The CNPV Era—High Stakes, Compressed Timelines, and Why $ATYR Is in the Spotlight

Bringing it all together, the way I see it, the launch of the CNPV program marks a potentially transformative moment for aTyr and for shareholders. In my view, this is not just another regulatory tweak—it's a real opportunity to compress the time it takes for breakthrough drugs to reach patients and for value to be recognised by the market.

For aTyr, Efzofitimod fits the spirit and letter of what the CNPV aims to accelerate: a first-in-class therapy for a genuine unmet need, with strong clinical and operational foundations. If the Phase 3 data delivers, and a voucher is secured, the effect could be high-magnitude—derisking the program, moving the company into a new strategic orbit, and steepening the timeline for all major value events, including partnerships or M&A.

If a voucher is not awarded, I don’t think this is a reason for despair. In my opinion, the fundamental aTyr thesis—a de-risked, late-stage asset in a field hungry for innovation—remains as strong as ever. The only difference is that the value will play out over the more familiar timelines, which still compare favourably to the average biotech journey.

For retail holders, I would suggest focusing on the signals that matter, not just the headlines. In compressed markets, time is often more valuable than price alone. If aTyr can secure a voucher, it’s a major win. If not, the long-term potential, in my view, remains firmly intact. The upside is real, and so is the challenge, but either way, it’s a story worth following closely.

## Key Features Analysis

The best rock climbing coffee mugs combine functionality with climber-specific aesthetics. They need to be durable enough to withstand the rigors of outdoor adventures while also showcasing a love for the sport.

**Material and Construction:**

The material used in a rock climbing coffee mug significantly impacts its durability and insulation properties. Many high-quality mugs are made from stainless steel, known for its robustness and resistance to corrosion. Double-walled vacuum insulation is another crucial feature, keeping drinks hot for hours and preventing condensation. Ceramic mugs, while more fragile, offer a classic feel and are often preferred for their aesthetic appeal. The construction should be seamless, with no weak points that could lead to cracking or leaking.

**Design and Aesthetics:**

A great rock climbing coffee mug features designs that resonate with climbers. These can include silhouettes of climbers on iconic routes, topographic maps of climbing areas, or climbing-related puns and slogans. Some mugs even incorporate textured surfaces that mimic the feel of rock holds, adding a tactile element. The color scheme should be appealing and durable, resisting fading or chipping over time.

**Size and Capacity:**

The ideal size and capacity depend on the user's preferences. Smaller mugs, around 10-12 ounces, are perfect for quick espresso shots or smaller servings of coffee. Larger mugs, ranging from 16-20 ounces, are better suited for those who prefer to savor their coffee or tea over a longer period. The mug should also be comfortable to hold, with a handle that is easy to grip even with gloved hands.

**Lid and Leak-Proof Features:**

For climbers who plan to take their coffee on the go, a secure lid is essential. The lid should be leak-proof, preventing spills during transport. Some lids feature a sliding mechanism that allows for easy sipping, while others have a screw-on design for maximum security. The lid material should be BPA-free and easy to clean.

**Durability and Impact Resistance:**

Rock climbing often involves rugged environments, so a durable mug is a must. Look for mugs that are advertised as being impact-resistant or shatterproof. Stainless steel mugs are generally the most durable, but even ceramic mugs can be reinforced to withstand minor bumps and drops. A powder-coated finish can also add an extra layer of protection against scratches and dents.

**Ease of Cleaning:**

After a long day of climbing, the last thing anyone wants is a difficult-to-clean mug. Mugs that are dishwasher-safe are a major convenience. Wide-mouthed designs also make it easier to scrub the inside of the mug by hand. For mugs with intricate designs, make sure the artwork is durable enough to withstand repeated washing.

Key features of a top-tier rock climbing coffee mug include:
    * Durable stainless steel or reinforced ceramic construction
    * Climbing-themed designs and aesthetics
    * Vacuum insulation for temperature retention
    * Leak-proof lid for on-the-go use
    * Comfortable handle and appropriate size
    * Dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning

## Core Benefits

A rock climbing coffee mug offers more than just a place to hold your beverage. It provides a connection to the climbing community, a reminder of personal achievements, and a practical tool for enjoying your favorite drinks.

**Enhanced Motivation:** Starting the day with a coffee mug that features a climbing design can provide a boost of motivation. Seeing a silhouette of a climber conquering a challenging route or reading an inspiring climbing quote can set a positive tone for the day and encourage you to tackle your own goals.

**Community Connection:** Rock climbing is a tight-knit community, and owning a climbing-themed mug can be a way to connect with other climbers. It can spark conversations at the crag or in the gym, leading to new friendships and shared experiences. The mug becomes a symbol of belonging to a group of like-minded individuals.

**Improved Hydration and Energy Levels:** A good coffee mug encourages you to stay hydrated and maintain your energy levels throughout the day. Having a dedicated mug that you enjoy using can make it more appealing to drink water, coffee, or tea, which is especially important during long climbing sessions. The insulation properties of some mugs also help to keep your drinks at the desired temperature for longer, ensuring that you can enjoy them at their best.

**Personalized Expression:** A rock climbing coffee mug allows you to express your personality and interests. Choosing a mug with a design that resonates with you can be a way to showcase your love for the sport and your individual climbing style. It's a small but meaningful way to add a personal touch to your daily routine.

**Practical Utility:** Beyond the symbolic and motivational benefits, a rock climbing coffee mug is also a practical tool for enjoying your favorite beverages. Whether you're sipping coffee at home, drinking tea at the office, or staying hydrated at the crag, a good mug makes the experience more enjoyable and convenient. The durability and insulation properties of high-quality mugs ensure that your drinks stay hot or cold for hours, while the leak-proof lid prevents spills during transport.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about rock climbing coffee mugs:

**What type of material is best for a rock climbing coffee mug?**
    Stainless steel is generally considered the best material for a rock climbing coffee mug due to its durability, insulation properties, and resistance to corrosion. Ceramic mugs are also a popular choice for their aesthetic appeal, but they are more fragile. Ultimately, the best material depends on your individual preferences and priorities.

**Are rock climbing coffee mugs dishwasher-safe?**
    Many rock climbing coffee mugs are dishwasher-safe, but it's always a good idea to check the manufacturer's instructions before putting your mug in the dishwasher. Some mugs with intricate designs or delicate finishes may require hand washing to prevent damage.

**How can I prevent my rock climbing coffee mug from leaking?**
    To prevent your rock climbing coffee mug from leaking, make sure that the lid is properly sealed. Check the seal regularly for any signs of wear or damage. If your mug has a vent hole, ensure that it is closed when not in use. Avoid overfilling the mug, as this can also cause leaks.

**Can I use my rock climbing coffee mug for both hot and cold beverages?**
    Yes, most rock climbing coffee mugs are designed to be used for both hot and cold beverages. Stainless steel mugs with vacuum insulation are particularly effective at maintaining the temperature of your drinks, whether you're enjoying a hot cup of coffee or a refreshing iced tea.

1lefaa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1lefaa2/liberty_of_the_seas_review/,Liberty of the Seas review,"LOTS review if anyone is interested! We sailed to Bermuda this month and had a great time. The ship is nice. There was plenty to do for young kids and adults. The kids loved the splash pads, pools and water slides. The ship also had the flow rider, climbing wall, mini golf and ice skating. The promenade wasn't huge but still very nice. I walked my child to sleep each day in his stroller up and down the promenade and that worked really well!

Service was great. Our cabin steward and waiters were both excellent and I would recommend them to anyone. Everyone was so kind.

Food was better than I expected and I'm pretty picky. I had heard some negative reviews on the food prior to sailing but was pleasantly surprised. We ate in the MDR, windjammer, sorrentos and cafe promenade. My daily coffee at cafe promenade was very guide and I am picky about espresso and coffee.

The rooms were fine. Dated of course, but no complaints. They were clean.

My biggest complaint was the odors. There were some pockets of the ship, hallways etc that smelled awful. Mildewy, musty, just awful. So bad that I would hold my breath as I passed through. I would totally sail LOTS again but only after the refurb after replacing carpets, hopefully a new air system etc. I was also shocked at how smoky some sections near the casino were. Are there any ships that don't allow smoking indoors? 

One other complaint were the elevators were a bit inconvenient when having a stroller. However, it probably wasn't so much the elevators but people riding the elevators who don't need them lol I feel like moms with babies, children, elderly, those with handicap etc should take priority over someone who just doesn't want to walk! 

Bermuda was nice too. We didn't explore too much due to having young kids but still saw a lot in two days. I much prefer Bermuda over the Bahamas (safer, people not trying to sell you things).

like it might still remember his weight
like the crease on the left side of the mattress
might whisper something back.

The room is too quiet now.
Not peaceful
just... unfinished.

The TV still turns on to his channel.
The toothpaste cap is still broken,
and I still squeeze from the middle
just to feel a little reckless like he used to.

I pour coffee into my mug
and hold a second one for too long,
before pouring it back like a funeral.

The closet smells like cologne and hesitation.

I wear his hoodie
not for warmth,
but for the ghost it holds.

I remember his hands
how they never fit right in apology,
how they lingered more on the doorknob than on my waist.

He said he’d call.

And he might.

Or maybe he won’t.

But the silence he left behind
answers louder than any ringtone ever could.

My friends say it’s good riddance.
That I should block his number,
change the locks,
sage the house.

But they don’t know
how heavy his absence feels
when I carry it room to room,
like a child I didn’t ask for.

I tried to move the furniture once.

Thought maybe if the couch faced a different direction,
I’d stop seeing him sitting there,
half-listening to my dreams
while texting someone else.

But it didn’t work.

Even the walls hum like him
distant,
tired,
half-committed.

He’s gone.

And still,
I live with him
in every object that stayed
when he didn’t.",1,1750248058.0,SadPoems,0,1.0,False

I’m a 29 year old guy from Turkey. I’m not overly familiar with every detail of American culture (I still confuse peanut butter with glue sometimes), but that’s exactly why I’m here — to learn more, share stories, and maybe start a connection that feels real.

I’m into simple but deep things:
☕ Good coffee (Turkish style — it’s like espresso’s older, wiser cousin)
🎶 90s music (from grunge to guilty-pleasure pop — yes, even early Britney)
📚 Occasional reading when the Wi-Fi is down
🌍 Learning how people live on the other side of the world

Not looking for anything too serious or dramatic — just relaxed conversations with someone who’s curious, open-minded, and maybe a little sarcastic.

If you’re into cultural exchanges, random humor, or you just want someone to tell you weird Turkish facts like why we eat soup for breakfast sometimes, hit me up.

Worst case: we laugh a little.
Best case: we understand each other across the planet.

1lef906,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1lef906/be_the_first_to_end_a_conversation/,Be the first to end a conversation,"I recently had a brief conversation with someone who has a business where she counsels kids to find and keep friends. I think most of the kids are neurodivergent but not all. 

One of the things that stood out to me was the concept of leaving the conversation before the other person does - at least some of the time. 

She said that an extrovert might feel resentful that she has to protect an introverted friend’s feelings and it becomes unbalanced. So she teaches kids how to notice body language that indicates the other person is about to leave the conversation (such as toes pointing away). And then she advises the kid to be the first to end the conversation in order to make it a more balanced friendship. (And walks them through scripts so they know how to do that). 

This kind of blows my mind. I wonder how it can be applied to adult friendships?

Maybe it looks like this: 

Friend and I are texting a lot and then her responses become shorter or just “likes”. So I read the room and say “well I gotta go get dinner ready. Talk to ya later!” 

Or maybe it’s meeting a friend for coffee and I notice that she’s starting to show signs that she’s ready to leave so I initiate the end of the conversation. 

What do you all think about this concept of making sure there’s a balance of ending conversations?",1,1750248028.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

For context:
- 31F
- Growing up, hindi priority ng family ko ang dental health so lumaki akong hindi super maalaga sa ngipin ko huhu
- Last year lang ako nagseryoso after kong mapastahan ng 6 cavities, some malalaki na
- There were consecutive years na hindi talaga nagvivisit ang family sa dentist. It also took us a while before we found trustworthy dentists.
- Coffee drinker ako so mas madali magstain ngipin ko pero sinundan ko na ang advice ng dentist to drink water in between sips of coffee
- my dentist's rate for oral prophylaxis ranges from 800 and can go up to 2k depende sa dumi ng ngipin sooo hindi na kasing dumi ng dati ang akin (dati i would expect to pay at least 1,500 sa same dentist)

Tips:
- if you get the go signal from your dentist, mag-electric toothbrush ka na asap. YouTube vids will show you how to use it properly
- Wait at least 30 minutes after a meal before brushing your teeth. Wait at least 30 minutes after brushing your teeth before ingesting something. DO NOT GARGLE. Idura lang ang bula ng toothpaste.
- FLOSS EVERY NIGHT. YouTube vids will show you the proper way, hindi yung basta ka lang nagtinga!!
- when drinking coffee/tea, uminom kayo ng water in between sips para mahugasan yung tannins na nagmamantsa ng ngipin. If hot ang drink, hot din dapat ang water
- For parents and future parents: children should be brought to the dentist the moment their first tooth appears. Set an example na rin sa mga bata when it comes to oral hygiene. Children are sensitive and pick up habits from their parents. 
- visit your dentist for oral prophylaxis every 6 months!!!

Alagaan niyo mga ngipin niyo!!! Absolutely worth it gumastos for routine dental care 💯

Two weeks ago, nagrant ako dito about sa aftersales support ni 1Z. Out of frustrations talaga kasi October 2024 un email ko about my Elesbi not charging pero never ako naka receive ng reply, also ung support desk na same pila lang sa Fanzone ng SAW Kickoff. Nagkaroon ng discussion about sa support and hindi lang pala ako ang may problema. We are complaining as customers and for me, that is okay.

After ilang days, I received a call from 1Z na nagfollow up about sa email ko. They apologized sa delayed response and gave solution and that is to email Tech Assist. Then nabanggit nya na na-Reddit na nga sila. Bilang madaldal na tita, nasabi ko na ako ung nagpost (jusko sobrang cringe nun username ko. Hahaha). Anyways, I emailed Tech Assist immediately.

Mga after 2 days, biglang nag announce si 1Z about Merch Care. Nawindang ang tita nyo kasi feeling ko dahil un sa Reddit post. Nakakakilig sobra! (Feelingera yaaarn). Same day nyan naka receive ako ng reply sa Tech Assist asking for my Viber. Tapos, waley na ulet.

After neto, nagtext ako sa staff na tumawag sakin for an update. She was really helpful and mabilis magreply (giiiiirl, let me treat you coffee or sana bigyan ka ng bonus ni 1Z!). Since wala pang Viber msg, I decided to try si Merch Care.

Today, I received a msg on Viber from Tech Support. Sobrang swerte ko lang siguro kasi malapit ung Repair Center sakin (like <1hr ride, 100 pesos Lalamove). I shipped my Elesbi around 3pm, Tech Support received it around 4pm. Ang expectation ko is matatagalan ung repair. But nooooo, mga 5pm pwede na daw ulet pa pick up. The repair cost is 300 pesos and the issue is naputol ung wire connecting sa battery. They have to replace both battery and wire. The cause is either nalaglag daw pero I doubt. Sabi ko baka kasi kakahampas ko sa katabi ko during con kaya nasira. Hahaha. After an hour, I received my fixed Elesbi. SOBRANG GINALINGAN. Bumawi talaga.

Ganito pala ung feeling pag priority ka no? Haha. Sobrang thank you sa kung sino mang staff ang lurker sa sub na to para iparating sa management ang concerns namin. Hindi ko talaga ineexpect kasi maliit lang naman ang community ng A'tin sa Reddit. (Tanda ko mga 2-3 yrs ago, kami kami lang talaga dito. Haha).

He cheated on his wife and then moved and became a pastor under my brother. Then he burned that bridge and started a church of his own. Then the church failed and then he started this like maker space and then that failed and then he started a coffee shop and now I think it's still open but he doesn't really talk about it anymore. 

He published a book and then kind of buried that and then he had a podcast which kind of blew up for a second and then he burned that bridge and buried that project as well. 

I've never seen anyone burn somebody bridges at the rate he does. It's honestly kind of impressive. 

It usually goes like this: 

Charm them by being outgoing, positive, supportive

Offer money or opportunity 

Push time around. Avoid payment. Avoid communication. Excuse, excuse, excuse.

Retract offer. 

I've seen him do this with more people than I can count. I tried warning a few people about it but it never really worked. In each scenario where I tried to warn them, it just ended up with another burnt bridge and hurt feelings. I watched a marriage deteriorate and end in divorce after a bad business dealing with this guy. I mean the marriage was probably going to end anyway, but he really really sped things up. 

Now he's promoting himself as a ""storyteller and peacemaker"". His Instagram photo is literally him holding up a mug that says ""World Peace"". He's flying all over the world shooting this new podcast series. It's just him virtue signaling-- going to different communities and doing his white savior schtick.

He went to Iran, he went to Israel, he's going all over the place. 

All the while, I don't think this guy has one real friend and he's hated his wife for years. 

I stopped being his friend years ago, but I'll check in on him every once in awhile to see what he's doing. This is just the cringiest most white savior bullshit I've ever seen him do.

I'm interested to see how it ends. Not the series itself. That's going to be some Casey neistat-esque, hacky bullshit, (we get it, you own drones), just his relationship with whatever organization he's working with. Inevitably he will remove all of this content and reinvent himself again in like 6 months.

1leet7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKParenting/comments/1leet7r/feeling_angry_at_my_baby/,Feeling angry at my baby 😔,"I want to start by saying I really do love my baby, a lot. 

I’m just so overwhelmed and feel like I’m struggling to cope. 

Baby is 7mo.

I feel like I just barely get a minute to myself anymore and I’m starting to crack under pressure.

I’m with the baby alone from 6am when he wakes up until 6pm when my husband comes home. 

I can’t take showers without him
whining at me, I sit him in his chair in the bathroom with me, but he just gets irritable and moans at me. 

I put him on his playmat to try and get a few bits done around the house, he lasts all but a few minutes before he’s fed up, grizzly and wants me to pick him up. 

Naps are a shit show. He won’t nap unless I hold him, but honestly, I’m so down at having to sit on the sofa holding him to sleep.
If I so much as breath loudly, he stirs and loses his shit.

I’ve started putting him in the car so I can go to a drive thru and have a hot drink whilst he sleeps. As soon as I stop the car to drink, he’s screaming as if someone has hurt him (he’s not in pain as he’s absolutely fine once I go to him) 

I take him for a walk but as soon as the pram stops, he wakes up. 
I bought a rocket for his pram but that doesn’t help. 

He’s usually asleep for bedtime around 7.30pm
but I haven’t been brave enough to put him
upstairs to sleep yet so he’s down
stairs in crib until I go to bed. 

I’m finding leaving the house an impossible task.
Between trying to get things done, trying to get ready, him screaming at me, I just can’t seem to get my shit together to go anywhere.

I met a friend for coffee yesterday, and surprise, he cried and screamed the whole time. 
Wouldn’t sleep in his pram, wouldn’t settle being cuddled. 

I love him, honestly I do. I think I just need a break 😔😓

Here is what I remember in great detail:

- 🎮 Genre: Match‑3 + medieval RPG.
- 🧝‍♂️ Protagonist: Gentleman with brown hair (coffee color), smiling.
- 👸 Princess: Redhead with a green dress, similar to Fiona in the human version of Shrek.
- 🐉 Story: The knight had to advance through a map to rescue the princess, kidnapped by a dragon.
- 🧩 Combat: Match‑3 type battles. The longer the Match, the stronger the attack.
- ⚔️ Improvements: Swords, shields and armor were obtained by advancing levels.
- 📈 Difficulty: It increased with each combat.
- 🖼️ Visual style: Very beautiful, like Disney cartoons.
- 🔊 Sounds and music: During the game there were combat effects, character sounds (screams, excitement), and medieval fight-type music.
- 🖥️ Animated Home Screen: The knight, princess and dragon appeared on the cover and even made gestures or moved before pressing ""Start"".

Other information:
- It was in Spanish or at least the title or interface.
- I played it on an Android cell phone between 2012 and 2015 approx.
- It's possible that the name was something like ""My Hero"", but I haven't been able to find it by that name.

Does anyone else remember it or know what it's called?

1leeqio,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1leeqio/every_boyfriend_i_get_is_brutally_dying/,Every boyfriend I get is brutally dying.,"“It's me, Brianna. Not you.”

That's what my latest boyfriend told me before walking directly into the path of a truck. There was barely anything left of him, just enough to peel off the sidewalk.

I thought our relationship was going well. It's not like I'm desensitized to my boyfriends dying (or ceasing to exist), but it's almost become the norm.

Ben was my first boyfriend in high school and my longest relationship to date. 

Fluffy-haired Ben, with his dimpled grin and freckles. 

He was the type of guy who should have been popular but chose to keep to himself.

I met him in the principal’s office. Ben was being lectured for ‘sneaking around,’ and I was handing in a late assignment. All he did was wink at me, and I fell.

Hard.

We dated for two years, and I really thought he was the one. Ben told me he loved me, and every Friday he introduced me to a new restaurant. I was in love. 

I loved everything about him.

On the night before our senior prom, a drunk driver T-boned my boyfriend's car, killing him instantly. After his funeral, it was like he stopped existing. 

His parents left town, and every time I mentioned him, my parents would slowly tilt their heads and act confused.

My brother was the worst for it, considering he and Ben were best friends.

But he just looked at me with this weird fucking look in his eye, like his soul had been ripped out. Eyes are the windows to the soul, apparently, and my brother's soul was MIA. “Ben?” His expression crumpled. “Wait, who?”

Alex was my emotional support, who later became someone closer.

Funny Alex.

Blonde-but-not-quite-blonde Alex.

I met him in group therapy.

My boyfriend was dead, and he had just lost his mother. We didn't label it, because he had a girlfriend, and I didn't want to move on so quickly. I think we just found comfort in each other.

Eventually, though, Alex became something I wanted to label.

His sense of humor was a breath of fresh air. I didn't go to college because of Ben’s death, settling for a mediocre barista stop in town. Alex came in every day with fresh coffee and a sugar cookie. 

I think I loved him. 

I told him that, half asleep, I told him I wanted to try and be something more with him. Alex looked taken aback, but happy.

We spent the night together.

The morning after, I woke to my mother screaming.

Alex was dead in the bathroom, his blood splattering, staining pristine white.

According to the first responders, he died of a self-inflicted head injury. The exact same thing followed. I attended his funeral, and Alex’s family disappeared.

This time, I went back to his house. But according to a neighbor, his house had been abandoned for ten years. I had eaten pancakes in his kitchen just days earlier.

I broke in to see for myself, but my neighbor was right. The hallway was piled with ancient mail and threats of eviction. Alex’s room didn't exist. Instead, there was a storage room filled with boxes.

When I got home, my family had already forgotten Alex’s existence.

The town had forgotten him, and yet his blood still stained my bathroom.

Following Alex’s death, I was terrified of getting too close to people.

But Esme made it hard.

She was my third relationship. We met at a bar. 

I was extremely drunk and convinced I was cursed to kill all of my romantic partners. Esme. Cute Esme. Crooked teeth, smudged lipstick, and warm Esme.

Do you know that person you meet and instantly connect with? The person you're sure is your soulmate?

That was Esme.

I told myself I wouldn't get close to her. But I was already talking to this girl, already pouring my life out to her. 

Esme sat and listened, her chin resting on her fist. 

She was a first-year creative writing student, and she had a cat called Peanut.

I didn't remember much after that. 

We hit it off, and next thing I knew, we were curled up in the back of her car watching Buffy on her iPad. 

I told her about my exes, and she nodded and smiled, but I don't think she was really listening.

I told her all of my exes have died, and then been erased from existence.

Esme called me cute. She wanted to base a story around the concept, sitting up and grabbing her phone.

I have this memory of the girl I fell in love with at first sight.

She's nodding along to a Smiths song sputtering from my car radio, typing on her phone. I can hear the tapping of her nails, her lips curving into a smile. 

I can see the exact moment she gets inspiration, pulling her knees to her chest. She's wearing fishnet tights that are torn and a jacket that doesn't fit her.

She is fucking beautiful, and I don't want to lose her.

Alex was beautiful.

He had pretty eyes and brown curls that I liked running my hands through. Ben was beautiful. He made my heart swim, my stomach swarm with butterflies when I first met him. Ben was my first love.

The realization woke me up one night, three months into dating Esme.

Both of them were dead, wiped away like they never existed.

And Esme would follow.

At first, I tried to break it off with her without sounding crazy. I told her it was me, not her, and I wasn't in the mindset for a relationship.

Esme understood, but her eyes didn’t. I didn’t want to lose her. Esme lit up every room she entered. Her obsession with thrifted clothes, badly written poems, and her irrational fear of pandas made her someone I wanted to be with.

So, I stayed with her. I told myself Ben and Alex were just coincidences, that it was nothing to do with me, and I wasn’t indirectly fucking killing the people I fell in love with.

I avoided the ‘L’ word for as long as I could.

It slipped out on my way to work. Esme was driving.

I just said it, and her eyes lit up. She reached out and squeezed my hand.

At work, one of my colleagues, Jasper, caught my eye. When I twisted around to ask him to grab something, I glimpsed his phone screen. It looked like Tinder, though I didn’t recognize the layout.

It reminded me of Twitter, in dark mode. Jasper was leaning against the counter, his thumb hovering over a photo of Esme, chewing his bottom lip.

I watched his thumb prance across the screen before he gave up and swiped left.

Finishing up the woman’s coffee, I handed it over.

“Uhh, I asked for cream.”

Ignoring her, I sidled in front of my colleague, hyper-focused on whatever app he was playing around with. “What's that?”

Jasper looked up, his eyes widening, lips parting like a fucking goldfish.

“Clearly nothing.” Jasper sidestepped me, opened the refrigerator, and pulled out milk. But he already had milk. The bastard was stalling. We had zero customers waiting, so it was just the two of us and a long, dragged-out pause.

Jumping up and down on the heels of his feet, he shot me his usual grin, slipping his phone into his apron.

Jasper may have been smiling, but there was something twisted in his expression.

I couldn’t stop myself. “Was that a dating app?”

“Dating app?”

“Excuse me, can I get what I ordered?” The woman demanded, waving her coffee in the air. “I asked for whipped cream.”

Jasper saw that as an excuse, an escape, and nodded, fashioning a grin. He saw an opportunity, and took it.

“Of course, Ma’am! I'll get that for you!” He said, with a little too much sarcasm.

The boy took her coffee with a spring in his step, ducking in the refrigerator for the whipping cream. Jasper added too much whipping cream, dumping the drink on the counter with a little too much force. 

It was a good thing my colleague was marginally attractive guy with cropped blonde hair, and a deadpan voice that *somehow* attracted the ladies. 

Jasper could insult someone directly to their face, and they would just blush and get all tongue tied. I had seen it happen in real time. A girl was flirting with him, and used a *bad* pick-up line, which was something along the lines of, “Did it hurt when you fell from Heaven?”

He laughed, and her eyes brightened. She giggled along with him, nudging her friends. 

But he wasn't laughing with her. I saw the gleam in his eye. 

He was laughing *at* her. 

Still laughing, Jasper plonked her milk latte down so hard half of it spewed out. 

And, with that exact same charming smile, he deadpanned, “Did it hurt when you dropped out of a drainpipe?”

Yeah, my colleague was blessed with good looks. 

Otherwise, he would have been punched in the face by now. 

Presently, he was being his usual asshole self. “Is there anything *else* I can get you?”

The woman shook her head, pulling a face. 

Jasper had, essentially, ruined her drink. It was more cream than coffee. 

When she left the store, I situated myself in front of him when he was counting cash. “What were you just looking at?” 

I nodded to the guy’s phone sticking out of his pocket. “Was it like… a dating thing you were on?”

Jasper didn't even look at me, his lip curling. 

“That's kinda rude,” he hummed, “I don't peek at your phone.”

“Esme Hope.” Was all I could hiss out. “Was she on that dating app?”

My colleague proceeded to stare at me like I'd grown a second head, before his half lidded gaze flicked behind me. Jasper’s expression brightened. 

“Oh, Hanna is calling me!” He said, choking out a laugh. 

Hanna was *not* calling him. She was in the break room getting high. Jasper slowly backed away, maintaining his smile. 

“I'll be back in a sec, all right?” He grabbed that same carton of milk with a grin. “Don't you just *love* when your milk stays fresh?”

“What?” 

“Fresh milk!” He grinned. “Mulberry Farm’s finest.”

Jasper was darting away before I could coerce a sentence. 

After work, I texted Esme as usual. She was my ride on Fridays. 

Esme didn't reply. 

I texted her again, a little more panicked. 

**Hey, are you okay?”** 

When I called her, an automated voice told me she wasn't available. 

Already feeling sick to my stomach, I drove to her place myself. 

I could see the flashing lights before anything else, blurred red and blue sending my thoughts into a whirlwind. 

It took me ten minutes to muster the courage to jump out of my car, and ask a pale looking deputy what was going on. 

I tried to jump over the yellow tape, only to be politely pulled back. 

“Carbon monoxide poisoning,” the deputy told me. 

“The whole family is dead.” he sighed. “Mom, Dad, and their daughter in college.” 

I think he was trying to be sympathetic, awkwardly patting me. But I was already on my knees, all of the breath dragged from my lungs. “Luckily, it's just like going to sleep. Monoxide is a silent killer.”

*Monoxide is a silent killer.*

Was that the same as, *“I'm sorry. Ben was in the wrong place at the wrong time.”*

And, *“Alex was silently suffering. He did what he thought was best.”*

I didn't go to Esme’s funeral. Mom and Dad and Will had already forgotten her, just like the others. What I did do, several days later, when her name wasn't even a memory anymore– I bought flowers from the store. Roses were Esme’s favourite. 

The seller was around my Mom’s age, a plump looking woman wearing a floral dress, long red hair tied into a ponytail. 

She was on her phone, humming to a tune on the radio. 

*The Smiths*. 

“I hope she likes them.”  The woman said, wrapping the flowers in red ribbons. 

She had a strong southern accent that immediately annoyed me. 

I took the roses, stuffing them in my bag. “What did you say?”

The seller cocked her head. “Hmm?”

“How did you know they were for my girlfriend?”

The woman sighed, placing her phone on the counter. I glanced at whatever she'd been so interested in, but the screen was faced down. “Esme came in here a lot,” Her lips broke out into a sad, sympathetic smile. I was quickly growing sick of them. 

“Esme. She, uh, she told me you guys were dating. Esme was always buying roses for her room. Sometimes she would stand in here for hours, and just stare at flowers. I think she found comfort in them.” 

The woman sighed, fixing me with what I could only describe as a pitiful pout. 

Urgh. 

“I hope you can find the same comfort,” she murmured. The seller handed me an extra rose, and I found myself reaching out for it, my eyes stinging. Fuck. 

I hadn't cracked in at least fifteen hours, and that was a record. 

But now I could feel myself splintering, tears trickling down my cheeks. 

The Flower lady squeezed my hand. “I’m sorry, sweetheart. If it makes you feel better, it's just like going to sleep. Monoxide is a silent killer.” 

Her words were familiar. 

Exactly what the deputy said. Before I could speak, she dumped weed killer on the counter. “Did you know our plant killer is ten dollars ninety nine?” 

Her sudden bout of energy took me off guard. 

I tried to smile. “I don't want any plant killer.”

The seller nodded, handing me another rose. “Oh, of course, Darling! But it is five ninety nine! Just for today!”

Something pricked me, and I hissed out, wafting my hand. 

Damn thorns. I could already see a single spot of blood. 

I nodded, sucking my teeth against a cry. “Thanks. But I'll skip it this time.”

I took the roses to what used to be Esme’s grave. Now, it was an empty headstone with no name, no memories, no flowers, nothing. Just like Alex and Ben, Esme had been reduced to dirt under my feet. I stayed at her ‘grave’ for a long time, long enough for the sky to grow dark, and my thoughts darker. 

I tried to find a logical explanation for the sudden deaths of the people I got close to, but all I could think of was a curse. 

So, I started googling curses, leaning against Esme’s headstone, my knees to my chest. Had I *been* cursed? 

Was my family cursed? 

According to Google, a cursed object connected with the curse itself. 

Which could be anything. Though I didn't remember visiting any ancient ruins, or an old church. With zero answers, I headed home. I passed a guy playing The Smiths in his car. Then a group of older  women wearing ripped fishnets. 

Esme was following me. Just like Alex’s smell. Fresh coffee and rich chocolate. 

Ben’s cologne filled my car last summer. His favourite band was playing all day on our local music station. 

I drove around with no destination, listening to each one on repeat, until I was losing him all over again. 

The sweet aroma of flowers followed me all the way home, and I was tipsy on the smell, when I found myself face to face with a boy. Under the overexposed streetlight, this guy was almost ethereal, thick brown hair and freckles. 

He reminded me of Ben. Which wasn't fair. I thought I was hallucinating him, before he came closer, bleeding from the shadow. I saw more of him, white strips of something wrapped around his head. 

*Wrong*. 

The word slammed into me when I glimpsed his clothes. Filthy. 

The guy was wearing a white button down, a single streak of bright red ingrained into the material. His white pants were torn, glued to his legs. 

He was barefoot, the soles of his feet slapping on wet concrete. 

I didn't realize he was in front of me, nose to nose, until he shoved me. Hard. 

“Josie.” His voice was a whimper, despite his narrowed eyes, his lips twisted into a scowl. 

He was crying. 

The boy shoved me again, and I staggered. 

His ice cold breath grazed my cheeks. “What the *fuck* did you do to my sister?”

“Sister?” I whispered. 

Something wet landed on my cheek, suddenly. 

Rain. 

I wasn't expecting a downpour. The weather was forecasted to be clear. 

To my surprise, the guy let out a harsh sounding laugh. The two of us were slowly getting drenched, but neither of us were making a move to get out of the rain. My hair was glued to the back of my neck, my clothes sticking to me. 

But somehow, I wanted to stay in the rain. It was refreshing. 

When a thought hit me, telling me to *get out* of the rain, it was shoved to the back of my mind. The guy spat water out of his mouth, shaking his head like a dog. 

“Of course,” he muttered, “Drown me out with the rain.”

I found my voice, my gaze glued to intense red seeping through the bandage stapled to his head. He looked like he’d escaped an emergency room. “I don't know anyone  called Josie,” I said, “I think you've got the wrong person.”

The guy’s eyes narrowed. He stepped closer, grabbing my shoulders, and I noticed how hollow his eyes were, empty caverns carved into his skull. 

Eyes are the windows to the soul, and this guy was completely soulless. 

“I'm only going to say this once,” he whispered, “What did you do to my sister?”

Before I could respond, the guy was being violently grabbed, and dragged back. 

Figures who appeared seemingly out of nowhere. 

“Let me go!” He cried out, struggling. “You fucking assholes! Let me go!”

His screaming became muffling, when his cries were gagged.

“You promised!” He yelled, his cries collapsing into a sob. 

“You said if you took me, she wouldn't get hurt! So, where is she?” he met my gaze, his expression crumpling, something inside him coming apart, splintering by the seams. 

“You can't take *both* of us, this wasn't in the agreement!” 

When he was dragged further back, I noticed a car parked at the side of the road. 

The boy was pulled inside. At first, he refused, before an extra pair of hands shoved him. “You fucking– *mmmphmmhphmmm*!”

I heard his fists slamming into the windows. 

“Don't take me back there! Please! Just let Josie–” 

His cries once again collapsed into angry muffle screaming, and I felt my hands moving towards my pocket for my phone. 

This was a kidnapping, right? I was witnessing a kidnapping in broad fucking daylight. 

A shadow was suddenly in front of me, and I jumped, tearing my eyes from the car. Jasper, my colleague. He was still wearing his apron, and to my confusion, was swinging a carton of whole milk. 

“Sorry, Bree,” He winked, speaking in a  single breath. “As you can see, our friend here had a *little* too much to drink.”

I nodded, craning my neck. Jasper stepped in front of me, maintaining a grin. 

“Who is he?” This time, I side-stepped away from him, only for him to copy. 

“Just a... guy.” He said. “As you can see, he's a little…” Jasper prodded his right temple. “Let's just say he's got a few too many screws loose.” Jasper laughed, staying stock still, blocking my way. 

When I made a move to counter him, he stepped in front of me, his eyes hardening. “I heard he lost his family a while ago in a…” He pretended to think. “Oh, yeah, a car crash. Maybe a gas explosion, I’m not really sure.” 

I could hear the car behind him, and once again I tried to dart past him. But he was quick to block my way. He was getting closer to me, very subtly backing me in the opposite direction. 

“Anyway, this guy is kiiiiind of nuts. Dude still thinks he's got a sister.”

When I lost patience and shoved him out of the way, the car, and the guy, was gone. 

“See?” Jasper rolled his eyes. He was still holding milk from work. My head spun. 

It was 8pm, we were in a suburban neighborhood, and Jasper was holding half a pint of milk. His apron was stained with coffee, and when I really *looked* at him, I realized he was out of breath. 

He was doing a good job of hiding it, exhaling in intervals, swiping at his forehead to clear sweat. 

When I noticed, he pretended to run his hands through his hair. 

“I, uh, I feel for him! Like, I'm sorry his family died, or whatever, but attacking random girls isn't cool, y’know?”

Instead of replying, I stumbled home. It was sunny. 

At 8pm.

And when I took notice, I wasn't even wet. 

Esme was my last straw. I made a promise to myself to not get close to anyone. 

The guys and girls I met were friends, and nothing more. Weirdly enough, the only guy I was getting close to was my colleague. I don't know if it was brain damage, or I was finally losing the plot. 

But Jasper’s shameless cruelty towards customers, and that quirk in his lips when he made them cry, was kind of hot. 

However, he was playing hard to get. 

And I mean REALLY playing. 

I was in storage trying to find vegan milk, and he was suddenly a fucking expert, spewing milk facts. 

When I slammed the refrigerator door shut, he was inches from my face. 

In the dim light from a single spluttering bulb, his eyes reminded me of coffee grounds. I thought maybe he was going to kiss me, judging from his softening expression. I felt his hands go around my waist, and I felt myself immediately melt. 

I don't know what came over me. It's like, one minute I hated him, and the next… I was suddenly hot. Really hot. And I really wanted to take my clothes off. I thought that's what he wanted to do too. 

I mean, his gaze followed mine, piercing, fingers playing with the buttons on his shirt. Before he leaned forward, his breath in my face. 

“Did you know that Mulberry Farms is an award winning brand of milk in our town and ONLY our town? Mulberry farms was bred and made right here.""

And suddenly, I was no longer hot and bothered. 

“I didn't.” I said, ducking into a crouch to search the shelves. “Have you seen our vegan milk? We did have some.”

“Three *time* winner,” Jasper continued. When I jumped up, he stepped closer, and I felt my cheeks spark. His smile was rare. In fact, Jasper was only smiling when he was talking about *milk*. 

“Mulberry Farms have the best pasturization. It's suitable for everything! Coffee, cereal, or maybe you just want a glass of fresh milk to yourself! Perfect for kids, too! Breakfast time *is* Mulberry Farms.”

“Are you having a stroke?” I whisper-shrieked. 

“Nope!” 

Jasper twisted around, shooting me a grin. 

I left the storage, however, with butterflies in my gut. 

There was no way I was falling for my asshole colleague. 

Somehow, though, I was. 

Just standing next to him filled me with electricity. 

The way he talked down to customers, insulting me to my face… I was thoroughly, and disgustingly, in love. 

I tried to stop myself. 

I showered in ice cold water. 

I ate (choked on) a ghost pepper. 

I even asked my BROTHER for advice, who told me to go for it. 

I told him Jasper had one (of several) flaws, but this particular one was off-putting. 

“He’s obsessed with milk.” I told my brother. 

Harry lifted a brow. “Is that a euphemism, or…”

He paused, for way longer than necessary. “So, your would-be-boyfriend has a milk fetish?”

I left his room before he could take that conversation further. 

I wanted to say Jasper was the only one who acted weird. 

But over the next few weeks, I noticed it in quite a few people. 

I was having breakfast with Mom, and she lifted up the box. 

“Choco Flakes.” She blurted, “Aren't they just the best?”

I nodded slowly. “Yeah, Mom. They're great.”

I prodded the box with a smile. “Only a dollar ninety nine.”

There were so many townspeople on their phones. They walked around with groceries or briefcases, their eyes glued to whatever they were swiping through. 

I was serving an old woman, when I caught her phone screen. 

I could have sworn there was an image of Jasper. 

She swiped right, and I had a hard time looking her in the eye. 

The woman was at least in her 80’s. And I'm talking, can barely walk, and needs assistance. 

Was she seriously hitting up 25 year old guys? 

Walking home, *everyone* was on their phones. 

I stopped at a crossing, stabbing the red light. 

It started to snow the second I stepped out onto the road, white flakes dancing in front of me. It didn't even cross my mind that it was almost June. The snow was pretty, accumulating on the ground. 

“Oh shit, sorry!”

Lifting my head, a guy was standing in front of me holding an umbrella. 

I knew him. 

But not from whatever was trying to pollute my mind. 

I knew him from a while ago. I knew him from the rain. I knew the bloody bandages wrapped around his head, and soulless, seething eyes I couldn't understand. It was the boy who was dragged away three months prior. 

He looked different, his hair was shorter, his face carved into a thing of beauty. 

The white strips of gauze bleeding scarlet were gone, his filthy clothes replaced with a white shirt and pants, a trench coat flung over the top. I didn't remember him being this handsome. His dark brown hair had been tamed and curled. 

It was his expression that sent shivers sliding down my spine. 

His too wide smile and unblinking eyes made me suddenly conscious of two bright lights on the two of us. 

So bright.

Something shattered in my mind, and I was aware of a lot of things. 

The snow under my feet was *too* soft. 

I glimpsed a single streak of red seeping from his nose, his hands trembling around a takeout coffee cup. 

Behind me, people were staring. I could see a group of teenage girls giggling. 

“It's him,” one of them squeaked. “It's the new love interest!”

“Bree?” His grin widened, snowflakes prancing around us. His teeth gritted together. I could tell he hated every word. “Holy shit, long time no see!”

He held out his hand, and I could see visible pain contorting in his eyes. 

*Help me.* He was screaming through a twinkling smile. 

“Don't you remember me? It's… it's uh, it's Sam!” he laughed. “From eighth grade!”

The lights blinked out, and the thought crashed into my mind. Static images filling my head. I shook them away. 

Oh, yeah, it *was* Sam. 

My childhood friend. 

 But I didn't reply. Instead of saying, “Sam? It's been so long!” I found myself walking, stumbling over to the girls. 

Who were rapidly swiping left on their phones. 

“What's that?” I demanded in a sharp breath. 

I grabbed for the phone, only for Sam to step in front of me. He settled me with a smile. 

Behind me, one of the girls fainted. 

Sam’s smile didn't waver. Though he did side-eye the girl being carried away. “Why don't I take you out for coffee?”

Apparently, *coffee* was the code word for hooking up. 

Sam dragged me into the nearest coffee store, straight to the bathroom. 

When he shoved me into a stall, I didn't know what to say. 

“Take off your shoes,” he said in a hiss, and after hesitating, I did. 

Sam pulled off his jacket, shook snow out of his hair, and got real close. 

“Look up.” He murmured. 

I did, my gaze finding the ceiling. 

“To your right, a camera is very well hidden, but can be seen with the naked eye if you catch what looks like a red laser,” Sam said. 

“To your left, another camera, as well as a vent that is currently pumping the stalls with aphrodisiacs. And right now, we are in the red zone. Meaning, you should be conscious.”

He prodded me, and I flinched. 

“Mostly conscious.”

His words went right over my head, my mind was foggy. 

I couldn't think straight.

I think I asked him what he was saying, but my mouth was filled with cotton. 

“Snap out of it,” he said, “Like I said, they're *making* you feel like this.”

He shoved me against the door, which broke me out of my trance. Slightly. 

“I hate what I'm going to say right now,” Sam groaned, tipping his head back. 

He was sweating, I noticed. 

Bad. I glimpsed beads of red pooling down his neck. He noticed me staring. 

“I'm okay, for now. I’m faulty, so the connection is severed. He squeezed his eyes shut. “I…think.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Sex.” He said, blinking rapidly. I wasn't going to comment on his slurring voice. 

Sam stumbled, fresh blood dripping from his nose. 

“We need to do the sex. Like…” His eyes rolled into the back of his head, but he managed to stabilise himself. “Nooooow.”

“What?!”

“Is everything okay in there?” 

The voice was a woman. She knocked on the stall. 

Sam’s eyes widened, coming back to life a little. “They're paranoid,” he whispered. When I could only stare at him, he pounded his fists into the door. 

“They think we’re fucking,” he hissed, “So, we need to make it believable.”

*“They?”* I mouthed. 

He didn't reply, swiping at his haemorrhaging nose. “Just… move around against the door. That'll fool ‘em.”

I did, doing my best to shuffle around, slamming my back against the lock.

When the metal clanged, he shot me a look. “I said sex!” He hissed, “Not murder!” 

Sam jumped onto the toilet bowl. There was an open window above him. 

*“That's enough.”* He mouthed, hoisting his way through. 

He helped me through, and I expected to land on concrete. 

What I did land on, however, was something… squishy. 

Something wet sliding between my bare toes. 

Looking closer, I recognised the beaded anklet. 

Fishnet tights. 

Something animalistic clawed from my throat. I was standing on Esme. Or what was *left* of Esme. She was just a torso and legs, the rest of her ripped away like doll pieces. I couldn't see her face. I looked for it, digging through what could only be old flesh and pieces of limbs. 

I felt suffocated. I grabbed half of Ben’s face that had been ripped off, and then Alex’s tattooed arm. 

There was so *much* of them, piles and piles of the same heads, the same filthy and rotting clothes. I was screaming by the time I shuffled back on my hands and knees, trying to wipe them off of my skin. 

They were all over me, staining me, painting me. 

Sam’s hand slick with blood gently covered my mouth. 

“Stay calm, all right?” He whispered. “I would tell you everything is going to be okay, but the truth is, it's really *not*, there's like, a 99.9% chance you're going to… understandably freak out.”

He pulled me to my feet, letting out a heavy breath. 

Blinking rapidly, I could only see… pieces. 

Pieces of *people*. 

Legs and heads and torsos all piled into one mass of gore. 

“We’ve got maybe five minutes before they realize we’re not doing the devil's dance,” Sam sniffled, “Maybe ten, before my brain short circuits and I bleed out.”

I didn't know I was hyperventilating, until I couldn't fucking breathe. 

Closer towards the door, and I could hear… machinery. 

I couldn't stop myself. Even when I was aware I was standing in congealing blood. 

Rotten bodies. 

The dim light led me into what could only be described as a factory. There were three levels, and we were on the highest. 

Sam stepped forward, gripping the metal bar in front of us. I felt my legs buckling, a thick, pukey slime filling my mouth. 

“Soo, I guess it all started when Brianna Timberman was seventeen years old, and rejected by her childhood best friend, Sam Thwaites.”

Sam’s words collapsed into a low buzzing in my ear. 

All I could see was a conveyer belt, filled with… people. 

Boys. 

Girls.

But most noticeably, Ben’s, Alex’s, Esme’s, and *Sam’s.*

But they start as Ben’s, Alex's, and Esme’s. 

I could see regular people, their hair stripped away. 

Their skin sliced into, cruelly moulding them into the exact same four faces. 

When a large looming needle plunged into the back of an Alex’s head, I couldn't *not* watch. I waited for the guy to wake up, but I don't even think he was alive. 

He stood, unblinking, letting this thing twist and contort his face. 

And it was then, when I realized these things weren't even human. 

I could see the mechanics built under their flesh, both living tissue and metal melded together. 

“Brianna’s father, who is a liiiitle on the crazy side, with too much cash and not not enough logic, took his daughter’s rejection a little *too* personally,” Sam continued. 

“So, he promised his daughter he would find her the perfect match.”

I started to speak, the words coming out before I could stop them. 

“My father would never–”

“I didn't say it was *your* father,” Sam said. His eyes darkened. 

“Anyway, as I was saying, the townspeople became unhealthily obsessed with who Brianna would choose.""

He sighed. ""So obsessed, in fact, that the girl’s day to day life was broadcasted across town, while her potential love interests were ranked, week after week. Think of it like the Truman Show mixed with matchmaker. First, there was Ben.”

Sam’s smile thinned. “Her high school boyfriend.”

Sam shrugged. “She grew bored of him. Also, he kinda did something unforgivable.”

He continued. “Then… Alex. She liked him, but sometimes, he was a little too unserious. The guy was a clown.”

I backed away, but he was quick to grab my shoulders. 

“Finally? Esme. Who she truly fell for.”

I swallowed. “Esme is–”

He cut me off. “But I didn't mention that they hurt her, did I?” 

Sam leaned against the bar. Behind him, I could see a figure in white pushing a gurney with a Ben strapped to it. 

“Ben tried to assault her, insisting she *wanted* it. Alex dumped her on her birthday. Esme ended their relationship with a one word text. *Goodbye*.”

Sam mimed an explosion. “That was the nail in the coffin.”

I caught blood sliding down his nose. “You're still bleeding.” 

Sam gingerly prodded his nose. 

“Urgh. Yeah, it's an effect of the severing. I've been in the red zone too long. I should probably speed this up.”

He talked faster, his voice collapsing into a mumbled slur. 

“Brianna couldn't take it. Her best friend was ignoring her. Everyone she had fallen in love with hurt her. Esme wasn't returning her calls. Ben was sleeping around right in front of her, and Alex was still being a clown. Brianna’s poor parents found her hanging from her bedroom ceiling fan.”

I shook my head, my thoughts screaming. 

“No–”

He held a finger up to shush me. “Let me talk. Jeez.”

Sam folded his arms. “A grieving father would do anything to avenge his dead child, buuut… Mr Timberman took ‘finding a perfect match’ and ‘the show must go on’ a little bit too literally.”

His sickly smile found me. 

“The town wanted more of Brianna, and her life, so he turned his daughter’s failed love life into a town wide TV show, sending the entire teen populace into here,” he gestured around him. 

“To make the *perfect* suitors. Who *wouldn't* hurt his *new* Brianna.”

Something ice cold crept down my spine. 

He cleared his throat. “Mr Timberman grew, let's say, obsessed, with getting revenge on these specific four people. So, he started killing them–” He coughed. 

“Sorry. Us. Killing us for the funny ha-ha, ‘Look at how many times I can fuck with them!’ bit. And then recycling us into someone completely different.""

""Our names are gone. Then our personalities. Finally, our bodies ripped to pieces and sculpted into Brianna’s exes.” Sam poked me in the cheek. 

“The cycle continues. They reset your ticker and the town eats it up. They can bring back Esme, Ben, and Alex whenever they want and add curveballs.""

""Like the *bad-boy* colleague who becomes the fan favorite.” Sam’s lips curved. “For… some fucking reason.”

His eyes flickered open. “However, Brianna will never find a suitor because her father is a fucking  sociopath. To him and the town, his dead daughter’s pathetic love life is entertainment.”

He held out his arm. 

“See?”

I tried really hard not to look through the makeup. 

At noticeable skin grafts. 

“I was a Ben.” He said. “Then I was an Alex, and *then* I was an extra.” His eyes found mine, sad, suddenly. “But who I was originally is kinda gone. All I remember is a deal to protect Josie. I gave myself up so they wouldn't take her.”

“Your sister.” I said. 

Sam nodded. 

His earlier words hit me. He was talking like Brianna Timberman was dead. 

But *I* was Brianna Timberman. 

I was rejected by Sam, yes, but I found Ben. 

As if he could read my mind, Sam shook his head. 

“Look at yourself.” He said, his voice shaking. 

“And I mean *really* look at yourself.” 

Sam stepped closer. 

“Because, underneath all of that make-up and the prosthetics and surgery, and fucked up memories, you're just another recycled lump of flesh.”

He prodded my temple. “Who *thinks* she is Brianna Timberman.”

His voice was slurring again, a fresh stream of scarlet seeping down his chin. 

“Don't you want to know?” His eyes rolled to pearly whites. 

Before he could finish his sentence, Sam dropped to the ground. 

I remember warm arms grasping hold of me. 

Shadows with no faces. 

They pricked me twice in the back of my neck. 

A familiar voice in my ear, almost a hiss. 

*Jasper*. 

“You are the *worst* fucking Brianna.” He murmured. ""Like, dude, it's *painful* to be with you.""*

When I came to, I was standing up, somehow. 

At *work*.

**I am Brianna Timberman.**

The thought floated around in my head, my memory hazy. 

“Hello?!”

A man was waving his hands in front of me. 

“I asked for iced coffee, lady!”

Jasper was serving another customer. “Bree, wake the fuck up.”

They were trying to make me think I was hallucinating. 

Which was crazy, because my fingernails were still tinted with Sam’s blood. 

The marks he'd left on my wrist when he was yanking me, were still there. 

Bruised on my arm. 

“Bree!” Jasper snapped. “Snap out of it and make the dude his drink.”

“Right.”

The word slipped out of my mouth.

He caught my eye, winking, and Brianna Timberman internally squeaked. 

I half wondered what he was. Was he recycled, or an unwilling performer?

Throughout the day, I was fully aware my words were not mine. 

Like I was on autopilot. 

But not just that. 

My *thoughts* weren't mine, either.

I spent half of my shift staring at my colleague’s biceps. 

During my break, I went into the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror. 

I *am* Brianna Timberman. 

But even when I told myself that, my eyes were too blue.

My smile was too perfect. 

My teeth. 

Too white. 

My shaking hands prodded at my face, at someone else's face. 

So many faces, so many skin grafts. 

The thought was violent, sending tremors through me. 

How many people was I *wearing*? 

I started to claw at my arms and legs, my face. 

How many fucking people had I been? 

I grabbed a knife and tried to slice at my face.

 But there was no blood. 

How could there be no blood?!

When I got home, I found my family waiting for me. 

Mom, Dad and Harry, all of them beaming. 

“Bree!” Mom stood up, her lips stretching into a grin. 

My mouth was already moving, but they were not my words. 

“Mom!” 

I didn't know why she was smiling so much, until I saw Sam sitting at our dining room table. His smile was too big. 

His over-expensive shirt and pants did not suit him, and looked fucking gross, but somehow my brain thought it was hot. The worst part is, I couldn't and still can't tell which Sam he was. 

Was he the guy who told me the horrific reality of my existence? 

Or was he another recycled, mindless suitor? 

“This is Samuel.” Mom said, and Sam slowly stood. 

He took slow steps towards me, and kissed my hand.

I saw the slightest smudge of scarlet on his lip, but his eyes were blank. 

In the corner of my eye, my ‘father’s’ eyes were glittering. 

“Hello, Brianna.” Sam said, and I *swore* Now that I was awake, the walls were wolf-whistling. Laughing. 

*""Ooooooooooooooo!”*

My town is a blip on the map. 

I keep thinking if I tear at my skin, I will find who I am underneath. 

I don't bleed. 

I don't think who I *was* still exists under so many layers. But even if this is just a cry into the void, please help us.

A lot of the time, it’s not even about talent.

It’s more that no one ever really teaches us how to make a *living* from it.  
Music schools definitely don’t. They’ll drill technique and theory all day, but there’s zero focus on how to actually earn money in a way that’s sustainable.

So we just copy what everyone else is doing.

Gigging non-stop. Taking whatever students we can get. Charging rates that don’t even cover a coffee after the lesson.

And we think that’s just how it is.

But the truth is, it’s kind of the blind leading the blind.  
Most musicians are struggling, so we model ourselves on people who are also scraping by.

It wasn’t until I started stepping outside that bubble a bit that things shifted.

I started seeing musicians that were thriving, and making good money.  
And they were doing things I’d never even considered, teaching online in a different way, building systems, actually charging properly.

It made me rethink the whole thing.

I made a video on this topic here if you want to check it out:

1leep4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/italianlearning/comments/1leep4n/can_anyone_help_with_translating_a_supply_chain/,Can anyone help with translating a supply chain abbreviation?,"Hi!

I hope this is an acceptable post - I work in supply chain and one of our Italian suppliers sends an order tracker with the following headers:

QTA_ORD 
QTA_PTA
QTA_SPED
QTA_X_SCAT

Having worked here for a few years with lots of Italian suppliers, I can guess that QTA_ORD is total quantity ordered, QTA_SPED is derived from “spedizione” and therefore quantity shipped, and QTA_X_SCAT is short for “scatone” for quantity of boxes/cartons.

Can anyone help with QTA_PTA? With context I’d assume PTA is an abbreviation/acronym for something to do with a picking ticket/packing list, and guessing it means quantity available to load? I’d be interested to know if this is a widely used abbreviation or just this persons shorthand?

Side note - I find it very interesting how much you can subconsciously learn over the years just from immersion, and with the help of some knowledge of Spanish and French. I can understand the gist of an email regarding intermodal transport, but I’d struggle to order a coffee! 😁

✅ Great food

✅ Clean space

✅ Friendly staff

✅ Local support

But behind the scenes, we were barely holding on.

I was obsessed with *today’s* sales.

I just needed to survive the week.

The idea of planning for next month — or next season — felt impossible.

And that was my biggest mistake.

We had *no way to follow up.*

*No customer list.*

*No system to bring people back.*

We were relying on hope.

And *hope isn’t a business strategy.*

**Dan Kennedy** said it best:

*“Most business owners focus so much on today’s harvest, they forget to plant the seeds that grow tomorrow’s business.”*

We focused on the harvest.

Not the seeds.

When the slow season came, we panicked.

*Payroll was coming and we didn’t have the money.*

There was no more room on the credit cards.

No more credit left on the online loan we had already taken.

We were freaking out.

I knew taking out another loan was a terrible idea — but I didn’t see another way.

*My biggest fear was not being able to pay our staff.*

So we took out $30,000 just to survive.

That decision turned into **$163,000 in total debt** over the next decade.

All because we didn’t understand one key truth:

**The first sale is the hardest.**

After that, it gets easier — *if* you have a system to stay in touch, deliver a great experience, and give people a reason to come back.

We didn’t.

We just hoped they would.

The businesses that thrive?

They build *simple, proven systems* that do all of that for them — automatically.

And it changes everything.

If this hits home for you like it would’ve for me back then, 

I Appreciate the feedback on this — I learned the hard way.  

I put together a full breakdown of what I would’ve done differently, without the mistakes.  

Not trying to pitch anything — just real info I wish I had back then.

1leemjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1leemjf/colleague_ruining_my_work_life/,colleague ruining my work life,"tldr: my colleague is ruining my work life more and more as time goes on, manager is on her side without even listening to mine

context: this is in the UK, i work for a law firm in an admin role, the colleague is in the same role as me. she works two days a week, i work full time. i have been here 2 months, she has been here since 2019.

my (23F) first day working here, my colleague who we will call S (40ishF) has made me feel isolated and ostracised. the colleague who covers her non-working days is lovely and friendly. but S makes a point not to talk to me. if i ask for help (i’m new and still learning) she rolls her eyes and acts like it’s an inconvenience. if i try and make conversation with her she just gives me blunt one word answers and then remains silent the rest of the day. however, she will go and chat to other people working upstairs for literal hours at a time.

she misses things at work all the time - silly little mistakes like forgetting to send all the post out or close all the blinds (i have never brought this up with my manager because it would be unnecessary to when these things are easily fixed, and if it became a bigger issue i would bring it up with S herself. remember this for later).

she rarely does any work, choosing instead to sit on her phone, stare at her emails for hours or talk to people upstairs. whereas i’m doing all the tasks on a thursday and friday to compensate (i don’t mind as it means i don’t get bored in the afternoon, however it’s just for context that she hardly does any work on the two days she is in)

on friday, my manager (40ishF, we will call her C) came into the office and asked S for a catch up. this is normal for my manager to do as she doesn’t come in often so i didn’t think anything of it. they were in the room for about an hour which i did think was a long time but i didn’t question it. after my lunch break, C called me in for a catch up and said she had several points raised by S that she now had to bring up with me. this was everything that was brought up to me:

1. ‘the coffee machine had granules in it between wednesday and thursday. S shouldn’t be expected to clean it.’ - OF COURSE it had coffee granules in it, it had been used by everyone in the office between wednesday and thursday evening. i clean that damn machine every single day, morning and evening, but on thursday S had made a point that she wanted to clean it. the one time i don’t do it, she suddenly complains about having to do it. why would she complain about something she offered to do?

2. ‘little things are being missed’ - yeah, by S. but when i tried to bring that up in response, C told me i was just trying to shift the blame onto S. so it’s ok for S to bring things up but not me?

3. ‘OP leaves at 5pm’ - that’s my hours? 8:30-5 are my contracted hours, i am not going to stay and work unnecessary overtime especially when there’s nothing else to do and we don’t get paid overtime so it would be for free. just because S stays an extra 10 mins for no reason doesn’t mean everyone should have to. i tried explaining to my manager that those are my contracted hours so I will leave once they are over as stated in my contract, she told me not to talk back.

4. ‘i don’t know OP very well’ - i’ve tried the entire time i’ve worked here to get to know S. i’ve put in so much effort and she has shut me down everytime. i already find it so awkward, difficult and stressful to work with her, hearing her complaint about this to our manager just makes me feel even worse.

5. ‘i don’t like things being left for me to do on a friday. it’s not fair on me to have to do everything’ - this would be valid…if it was true. the only things left for her on a friday are a starters and leavers log which is HER designated job, and the friday stock order which we share between us anyway. she’s complaining about having to come in and do work that she doesn’t do anyway

6. ‘i didn’t appreciate having to change the batteries in the doorbell’ - at 4:55pm on a wednesday, we didn’t have time to change the batteries in the doorbell as it only died at that time. as i’m fairly new i had no idea how to change them. i asked S the next day if she could show me how to get the doorbell off and which batteries it needed. she said not to worry and that she would do it. so she bought the batteries and changed them. then she complains she shouldn’t have had to do it. once again, she offered to do something then complained about having to do it. it’s her literal job to do these tasks and i can’t learn if she refuses to show me.

7. ‘OP was in a bad mood yesterday’ - this is the first im hearing of it. i’ve NEVER been in a bad mood at work before. firstly, i would be SO embarrassed to be in a bad mood at work. secondly, there’s not even anything to be in a bad mood about! this job is easy and not stressful at all, i have a wonderful home life, i’m healthy, etc etc. i haven’t been in a bad mood for months, and i certainly never would be at work of all places. to me personally that would be unprofessional and awkward and embarrassing. i tried to explain this but yet again i was told to stop talking back.

my manager wouldn’t listen to me at all and told me these are all things i need to consider going forward. i am now taking photos of everything i do and logging them in a spreadsheet with dates and times. if S offers to do something instead, i make a note of that too. so if this gets brought up again i have some sort of evidence to back me up.

i am now dreading working with this woman, it was bad enough before she complained about it everything she could possibly think of, but now i know for a fact that she doesn’t like me and that how i’ve been made to feel since i started was true.

i am looking for another job but it’s going to be very hard to take time off to go to interviews (i will have to make up the time with this woman) and i’m not in a position where i can just quit without having another job lined up.

also, i will probably get comments about going to HR. i am employed by a parent company but work in the office of the owned company if that makes sense. therefore i have to bring up issues with the parent company HR who are based on the other side of the country and are renowned here for being mediocre. it’s an option but i don’t see much point.

anyway, just wanted to rant and if anyone has any ideas with how i can make working with S more bearable. i don’t want to clear the air with her because she’s made it perfectly obvious since i started working here that she can’t stand me and i’m now worried anything i say will get twisted to my manager, and C won’t even hear me out let alone take me seriously. thanks for reading lol

**“It’s clearly a wake up call, and unfortunately we waited until now to really listen to that call,” Smith said in an interview last week. “We need to have capabilities so that we have something more than zero.”**

**When China last used its grip on rare earth metals in a diplomatic dispute — temporarily cutting off exports to Japan 15 years ago — Smith was running the only rare earth mine in the US, as chief executive officer of Molycorp. As prices zoomed higher, he attempted to build out a mines-to-magnets supply chain.**

**The plan faltered, not least in the wake of falling prices as Chinese exports resumed, and Smith left in 2012. Burdened with debt and tough Chinese competition, the company eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2015.**

**Molycorp “needed more support, and they could not get it from the government at that time,” Smith said.**

**Smith is now CEO of NioCorp Developments Ltd. and along with a number of former colleagues from Molycorp, is developing a new mine in Nebraska which could produce rare earth elements as byproducts, including terbium and dysprosium, which Beijing started controlling earlier this year. It will also extract scandium, a relatively abundant rare earth, along with minor metals niobium and titanium.**

# Permitting pains

The Nasdaq-listed company has all the environmental permits it needs and is applying for a grant from the US Department of Defense, as well as loans from the Export-Import Bank of the United States and its UK and German equivalents, Smith said. It will then begin the three-year process of building the mine as soon as later this year, he added.

**“We have all of our permits in hand to start construction today,” Smith said. “Almost every other mining project that I can think of in the United States is into the permitting nightmare of litigation and appeals.”**

***Even with “zero permitting risk,” production would start in 2029 at the earliest — a reminder of just how long even approved mines can take to get to production, even when companies and governments around the world are frantically trying to find sources of supply.***

Smith argues the last crisis was a cautionary tale. Tokyo set about reducing reliance on China, using government money to create a stockpile and invest in a mine in Australia run by Lynas Rare Earths Ltd.

In 2010, Japan “saw the issue and did something to deal directly with it — they supported Lynas,” Smith said over video chat. The company is now one of the largest miners and refiners outside of China, and supplies about 30% of Japan’s rare earth needs. It was not an overwhelming win — not least given the time required and cost — but a crucial one.

The reaction in the US was different. While firms and the government initially looked to build up domestic suppliers, a subsequent crash in prices meant Chinese companies were the cheapest suppliers. That mistake is now being rectified.

# Seeking alternatives

**“Every time we go to Washington, DC, all that we hear about is critical strategic minerals, particularly the heavy rare earths,” he said. “They are the number-one priority in the country right now.”**

Past efforts to push back have made a difference, though.

The successor to Molycorp, now called MP Materials Corp., produces neodymium and praseodymium elements used in magnets. Smith argues it’s because of the existence of Lynas and MP Materials that China didn’t impose export controls on those two elements — a supply chain Beijing doesn’t completely control.

However, no firm outside of China can yet produce significant quantities of the terbium, dysprosium or samarium limited by Beijing and necessary for magnets to endure high operating temperatures. By far the biggest sources of those elements have been in China and Myanmar, with almost all the refining and processing done at Chinese plants.

# “We have resources in the United States. We have resources in Australia. We have resources in Canada. Those are the ones that we need to go after,” said Smith.

# “We need to start building the facilities that we need, onshore, to address this problem,” but it’s going to be a “long, hard process” until these metals can be produced at volume and do away with China’s negotiating card, he said.

***Beijing’s dominance in strategically crucial minerals gives it major leverage in trade talks.***

[China has a virtual monopoly in the sector, dominating the entire supply chain from the extraction of rare earths to their processing and the manufacture of permanent magnets. | China Out\/EPA](https://preview.redd.it/qkc8z7eiun7f1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c58b68a85e9172ff770e9b619c6f81ed64764838)

BRUSSELS — As Beijing asserts itself amid global trade tensions, it is playing an ace it has kept up its sleeve for decades: control over the flow of minerals Western countries desperately need to fuel their green, digital and defense ambitions. 

When U.S. President Donald Trump last week [hailed a draft “framework”](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/11/trump-trade-syndicate-00399047) with Beijing to end their trade dispute, he singled out China’s export controls on seven rare earth elements — minerals deemed “critical” because they are used in the production of high-tech products such as magnets used in cars.

“Our deal with China is done, subject to final approval with \[Chinese\] President Xi and me,” Trump [wrote in a post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114664632971715644) on Truth Social. “Full magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, up front, by China.”

In return, the U.S. agreed to drop plans to revoke Chinese student visas. But the situation remains tense — at the G7 summit in Canada, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen [accused China](https://pro.politico.eu/news/200314) of “weaponizing” its leading position in producing and refining critical raw materials.

At the summit, Western leaders were expected to pledge to implement a “G7 critical minerals action plan.” But [their statement](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2025/06/17/g7-critical-minerals-action-plan) didn’t name-check China, instead obliquely mentioning “non-market policies and practices in the critical minerals sector.”

“China has the upper hand in the short term,” said Philip Andrews-Speed, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. Beijing’s export controls are “much more powerful than a tariff that Trump is putting on,” he added. 

Those controls — initially imposed in April and framed as a response to Trump’s tariffs — sparked outrage and alarm among [industry bosses](https://pro.politico.eu/news/199789) and officials in the U.S. and across the EU. They apply to all countries, requiring companies to be granted a license for each shipment. 

Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič earlier this month called the situation “alarming” for the European car industry as well as for industry more broadly. “Rare earths and permanent magnets are absolutely essential for industrial production,” he argued, with the magnets an essential component in everything from smartphones, TVs and computers to car and wind turbine engines and defense applications. 

# Decades in the making

It’s a gambit Beijing has skillfully crafted for decades — and one that projected market developments are only set to buttress.

China has a virtual monopoly in the sector, dominating the entire supply chain from the extraction of rare earths to their processing and the manufacture of permanent magnets. 

According to the International Energy Agency, [the country accounts for](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1drqeev36qo) some 61 percent of rare earths extraction and 92 percent of refining. Moreover, it provides nearly 99 percent of the EU’s supply of the 17 rare earths, as well as [about 98 percent](https://eit.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2021_09-24_ree_cluster_report2.pdf) of its rare earth permanent magnets. Global demand for these minerals is expected to increase by [50 to 60 percent by 2040](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2025/overview-of-outlook-for-key-minerals).

https://preview.redd.it/j9l9vgyoun7f1.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=4290a9d998e53ce82b430ccadb558ac0ef1525be

“Over the last few years, China has managed to build up this kind of defence system,” said a person from the Chinese business sector, granted anonymity to speak candidly. That gives Beijing “confidence” on the international stage, they added.

Back in 1987, when the U.S. still dominated mining and the metals and minerals were of far less — and certainly not “critical” — importance, then-ruler Deng Xiaoping said: “The Middle East has oil, China has rare earths.” Deng, China’s most important figure from the late 1970s until his death, was at the time touring Baotou in the interior of Mongolia, China’s rare earth center. 

Since then, Beijing has heavily invested in growing its monopoly and capitalizing on it. 

In 2020 it overhauled its export control regime, passing an [Export Control Law](https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/charting-china/2025/02/chinas-use-of-export-controls/#:~:text=The%20Chinese%20government%20began%20by,security%20technology%20into%20one%20framework.) that largely emulates U.S. legislation. Four years later it took another step in building a domestic legal foundation by introducing [export control regulations](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-issues-new-export-control-regulations/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20new%20regulations,subject%20to%20temporary%20control%20measures.) for so-called dual-use items that can be used for military and civilian purposes.

It has also shown it doesn't shy away from using these tools. In 2010 China [briefly restricted](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/revisiting-china-japan-rare-earths-dispute-2010) rare earth exports to Japan; more recently it [has imposed](https://www.stimson.org/2025/chinas-germanium-and-gallium-export-restrictions-consequences-for-the-united-states/#:~:text=China%27s%20new%20ban%20on%20germanium,through%20trade%20via%20third%20countries.) [export restrictions](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-bans-exports-gallium-germanium-antimony-us-2024-12-03/) on gallium, germanium and antimony (which are also deemed critical minerals) and [banned the export](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-bans-export-rare-earths-processing-technologies-2023-12-21/) of rare earth processing equipment. 

https://preview.redd.it/x4g1jtvtun7f1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a234efe83b6bd26b5aca6d8d28726833efacf53

While the person from the Chinese business sector quoted above argued that the export control system is a “tit-for-tat measure for the U.S.,” Beijing decided — in its latest move — to target all countries rather than just the U.S. That’s also leaving a mark on European industry.

“All export licenses now have to be re-approved and there has been a temporary de facto export ban, meaning we are experiencing a backlog in the approval of new export licenses, which is still affecting supply chains today,” said Stefan Steinicke, a raw materials expert at the Federation of German Industries, a business lobby group.

The controls not only give the Middle Kingdom more leverage in trade talks with the EU by sending a warning to Brussels not to team up with Washington — they also afford it valuable insight into rare earth supply chains. Earlier this month Beijing [agreed to set up a “green channel”](https://pro.politico.eu/news/199949) for European companies to speed up the approval of licenses.

# Catch me if you can

In response, industry bodies are pushing for the EU to accelerate its own efforts to diversify supply away from China, alongside pursuing diplomatic efforts.

James Watson, director general at metals lobby Eurometaux, called on Brussels to “continue to invest in international cooperation,” to “support recycling efforts and the circular economy in the EU,” and to push “domestic production of certain metals in the EU.”

But as keen as the EU is to play catch-up and slash its dependence on China for the minerals — as recently exemplified by its [designation of several rare earth](https://pro.politico.eu/news/199692) extraction and processing projects within and outside the bloc as “strategic” — it faces a mammoth task. 

Rare earths aren’t as rare to find as their name suggests — they are, however, difficult to extract and refine in economically viable quantities, with all of the biggest reserves found outside the bloc’s borders. 

https://preview.redd.it/gnb7jok2vn7f1.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&s=b43941056933d7186bd6d8f473cca3a75c6ceab5

“The outlook for substantially denting China's dominance in the next years is pretty grim,” said Andrews-Speed, the Oxford researcher. “Twenty, 30 years ahead, anything can happen with technology and trade.” 

With more minerals set to be used as levers in the future, China’s chokehold on rare earth minerals is only the beginning. 

Its sway over rare earths is an “extreme case,” but China also dominates a vast array of other minerals such as lithium and cobalt and is “increasingly moving … downstream in the value chain,” said Edoardo Righetti, a researcher in the energy, resources and climate change unit at the Centre for European Policy Studies think tank.

Rare earth elements play an essential role in building new technologies, especially those used for renewable applications; however, the global supply chain has been primarily dominated by China.  

The group is made up of 17 metals that are relatively abundant in the Earth's crust, but are difficult to extract and rarely found in pure form, earning them the name ""rare earth.""

Heavy rare earth materials are a subset of that group, and Australian firm Lynas Rare Earths recently [announced](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/LYC/02947190.pdf) that it's ""now the world's only commercial producer of separated heavy rare earth products outside China.""

The company has been operating a rare earth refinery in Malaysia since 2012, where it's been processing ""light"" rare earth materials used in [smartphones](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/rare-earth-elements-magnets-smartphones/) and defense applications, according to [Mining.com](https://www.mining.com/lynas-becomes-first-producer-of-heavy-rare-earths-outside-china/). 

Now that Lynas has begun to produce dysprosium — a key material for manufacturing [electric vehicles](https://www.thecooldown.com/electric-vehicles/) and [wind turbine](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/us-wind-power-coal-surpassed-energy/) generators — it represents a major milestone in diversifying the supply chain for heavy rare earths beyond China, [according](https://techxplore.com/news/2025-05-rare-earth-production-china-major.html) to TechXplore. 

A [report](https://www.iea.org/news/diversification-is-the-cornerstone-of-energy-security-yet-critical-minerals-are-moving-in-the-opposite-direction) from the International Energy Agency has shown that critical mining markets have actually become more concentrated in recent years, with China handling the majority of the supplies aside from nickel.

""In a world of high geopolitical tensions, critical minerals have emerged as a frontline issue in safeguarding global energy and economic security,"" [said](https://www.iea.org/news/diversification-is-the-cornerstone-of-energy-security-yet-critical-minerals-are-moving-in-the-opposite-direction) IEA executive director Fatih Birol. 

The expansion of Lynas' material processing capabilities marks a potential shift in the market and opens up the possibility of more rare earth processing facilities in other regions. 

Lynas sources most of its ore from its Mt Weld mine in Western Australia and recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Malaysia's Kelantan state government to secure [additional feedstocks](https://www.mining.com/lynas-signs-deal-to-secure-rare-earth-feed-in-malaysia/) closer to its processing facility. 

The company [pitches itself](https://lynasrareearths.com/) as an ethical and environmentally responsible producer of rare earth materials, which is especially important given the environmental impact of [mining operations](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/newmont-gold-mine-pollution-air-quality/).

""However, it is a start, and it is crucial that other possible projects in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Europe, and Asia also prove technically viable and can be approved, so that the supply balance can really begin to shift.""

While mining is still necessary, there are advancements in [recycling](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/rare-earth-elements-magnets-smartphones/) that are helping to reduce the need for new [raw materials](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/e-waste-recycling-gold-extraction-carbon/) and ultimately lower costs for consumers. 

By extracting and reusing rare earth elements from [end-of-life devices](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/rare-earth-metals-e-waste-startup-alta-resource/), we can keep harmful substances out of [landfills](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/wefix-tunisia-electronic-waste-management/) and mitigate the impact that mining operations have on local ecosystems.

# China agrees to temporarily lift export restrictions under new trade deal with the U.S.

The United States and China have agreed on a trade deal that is expected to provide some relief to American manufacturers that have been forced to scale back production due to a lack of rare earth magnets needed for automobiles, clean energy, and high-tech devices.

""Our deal with China is done, subject to final approval with President Xi and me,"" President Trump wrote in a June 11 Truth Social post. ""Full magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, up front, by China.""

Critical minerals policy experts and the executives of companies endeavoring to establish rare earth supply chains in the U.S. say the deal struck between the U.S. and China during negotiations in London will likely bring short-term relief to American industries starving for rare earth magnets but does not resolve the underlying issue that makes rare earths such a powerful weapon in China's trade war arsenal.

The strength of rare earths leverage wielded by Beijing during trade negotiations with the U.S. and other Western nations lies in the fact that China controls approximately 90% of the global capacity to separate and refine this suite of elements critical to the clean energy, high-tech, and defense industries.

When it comes to heavy rare earths like dysprosium and terbium, which are used in the powerful magnets for electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, computer hard drives, and a long list of other modern devices, China has a near-complete monopoly over global supply.

""Each and every buyer in the U.S. now has to ask permission from China to build anything more technical than a handheld calculator,"" said USA Rare Earth Joshua Ballard.

While USA Rare Earth and several other companies are making significant headway on building various links of a rare earths supply chain in the U.S., substantial work remains to expand domestic light and heavy rare earth mining, refining, and magnet manufacturing capacity to meet the needs of American industry.

Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), notes that the current lack of domestic rare earths production capacity, coupled with the instability of U.S.-China trade relations, leaves American industry vulnerable to future rare earth restrictions or bans.

""The only long-term solution to the rare earths crisis is to build alternative supply chains that reduce dependence on China,"" she said.

In addition to building out domestic capacity, Baskaran says the U.S. should also work with international partners to unlock new deposits and establish processing and manufacturing hubs.

""Until these alternate supply chains are developed, China will retain its leverage, which poses a significant risk to the U.S. economy,"" the critical minerals policy expert added.

# China's chokehold

China's increased use of rare earths and other critical minerals as leverage in trade negotiations with the U.S. began as a response to the Biden administration's restrictions on the exports of U.S. chipmaking technologies to China.

Since 2023, Beijing has restricted or banned the exports of 16 critical minerals, along with separation and processing technologies that could be used to produce rare earths outside of China.

""China has increased its weaponization of various minerals over the last two years, including restrictions on gallium, germanium, graphite, antimony, tungsten, and rare earths,"" said Baskaran.

This growing list includes restrictions on the exports of seven rare earths highly critical to aerospace, automotive, energy, defense, and high-tech manufacturing put in place by Beijing in response to the heavy ""Liberation Day"" tariffs announced by President Trump in April.

The impacts of China's rare earth export restrictions quickly reverberated through American manufacturing sectors.

In May, Ford Motor Company temporarily halted Ford Explorer production at its Chicago plant due to a shortage of rare earth magnets.

This was quickly followed by a warning from the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA) that China's rare earth export restrictions have the potential to paralyze U.S. auto parts production if prolonged.

""The situation remains unresolved and the level of concern remains very high,"" MEMA penned in a statement to Reuters. ""Immediate and decisive action is needed to prevent widespread disruption and economic fallout across the vehicle supplier sector.""

Baskaran says China's export restrictions have also impacted the European Union and Japan, where automotive manufacturers have been forced to shut down parts and vehicle production due to the lack of rare earths.

Western manufacturers are expected to see an increased flow of rare earths and magnets following the latest round of U.S.-China trade negotiations that resulted in Beijing agreeing to pause export restrictions for six months.

In exchange, U.S. negotiators provided China with tariff concessions and agreed not to revoke visas for Chinese students attending American universities.

While the trade deal brings some temporary relief for American manufacturers reliant on Chinese rare earths, Beijing can still use these critical minerals as leverage if the trade war heats back up after the six-month truce.

""With its recent export controls (and outright bans) on rare earth elements, China has proven that it can choke off just about any technology industry in the United States at any moment and on any whim,"" said Ballard. ""Automakers were suffering, so we came to the table and presented our offering. They relented, and the industry can breathe... for six months, at least.""

# American supply chain

While it will take much longer than six months to break America's reliance on China for rare earths, several companies are working on various links to a complete mines-to-magnets rare earths supply chain in the U.S.

• **Energy Fuels'** [White Mesa Mill](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/04/23/tech-metals/americas-answer-to-chinas-rare-earths-ban/2242.html) in Utah is producing neodymium-praseodymium (light rare earths used in magnets) and accumulating concentrates containing six of the seven rare earths now restricted by China.

• **MP Materials** has [invested more than $1 billion](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/04/23/tech-metals/us-china-rare-earths-master-link-breaks/2243.html) in establishing a complete rare earths supply chain in the U.S., which includes the Mountain Pass mine and processing plant in California and a rare earth metals and magnets plant in Texas. The company has also forged a [partnership with the Saudi Arabian Mining Company](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/05/21/tech-metals/forging-a-saudi-us-rare-earths-supply-chain/2283.html) to establish a rare earths hub in the Middle East that can compete with China.

• **NioCorp Development** received an invitation from the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) to [apply for an $800 million loan](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2024/05/08/tech-metals/niocorp-takes-step-toward-800m-us-loan/1748.html) to help fund the development of Elk Creek, a critical minerals project in Nebraska that would provide a domestic source of niobium, titanium, scandium, and rare earths.

• **ReElement Technologies** is using a patented process to produce rare earths from mine concentrates, recycled magnets, and magnet manufacturing waste at its [recycling and processing plant in Indiana](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/02/12/tech-metals/reelement-drives-rare-earths-independence/2141.html). Earlier this month, the company reported the recovery of high-purity terbium, a heavy rare earth used to improve the performance and heat resistance of magnets, and the critical metal gallium from U.S. defense sector waste materials.

• **Rare Element Resources** has received an invitation from EXIM to [apply for a $553 million loan](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/03/26/tech-metals/us-bank-backs-wyoming-rare-earths-project/2203.html) to finalize permitting, engineering, and construction of a rare earths mine and processing plant at its Bear Lodge project in northeastern Wyoming.

• **Ucore Rare Metals** is utilizing funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the Canadian government to ready its newly developed RapidSX technology for upgrading heavy and light rare earth feedstock to salable individual rare earth products for installation at its commercial-scale [Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/06/04/tech-metals/dod-funds-ucores-final-rare-earths-push/2308.html).

• **USA Rare Earth** is scaling toward commercial production at a [rare earth magnet plant in Oklahoma](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/01/15/tech-metals/ok-facility-produces-rare-earth-magnets/2094.html) and plans to develop a rare earth and critical minerals mine at its enormous Round Top project in Texas.

[Rare earth metal produced at MP Materials' Independence metals and magnet plant in Fort Worth, Texas. - \(MP Materials](https://preview.redd.it/h32vjkiw4o7f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=63da56a04d9d4c6b48e13d9af36572c1af62855c)

While the U.S. projects currently in operation or under development represent all the links of a complete mines-to-magnets rare earths supply chain, they are not enough to eliminate America's reliance on imports, and many are several years and hundreds of millions of dollars away from being fully developed.

Ballard likened the need for federal support in developing a domestic rare earth supply chain to a ""modern Manhattan Project"" for the U.S.

""Just as the US moved quickly to build up manufacturing capabilities to defend ourselves and our allies in WWII, we need to make a similar effort to get this critically important industry up and running,"" the USA Rare Earth CEO said.

In the meantime, China holds a powerful trump card to play in future trade negotiations with the U.S.

""Whether or not this trade war lasts six months or five years, what is plain to see is the danger of a single choke point on such critical minerals and technologies to our way of life,"" Ballard added.

Not the storytelling. The soul-crushing, repetitive, 12-hour-day kind of editing.

The game has changed. Great AI tools now give you both speed & control. This isn't about replacing creativity, it's about automating the grunt work so you can finally be a full-time creator.

I found a tool that’s like Cursor for video editing, where you can edit your video with text prompts.

As a test, I gave it a 1 hour podcast and a single prompt:

""Remove all silences over 0.5s, cut out every 'um' & 'like'. Trim background noise. Cut to a close-up every time the guest starts talking. Export a 15-min highlight reel with key moments only.”

The entire rough cut was rendered in under 3 minutes. It processed and delivered a clean rough cut in less than 3 minutes. 3 MINUTES.

A task that normally takes me 3-4 hours of deep work was done before I could finish my coffee. This is how it 10x my workflow.

I didn't build this tool, and I'm not selling anything. I'm just sharing this because it feels like a fundamental change.

Our value as editors is no longer in our speed with hotkeys, but in our creative direction. The machine can do the labor, we provide the vision.

If you’re an editor and still drowning in manual edits, you need to check this out. The game is different now.

Have anyone used something like that before? Please share your experience below. I'm curious to know what everyone thinks.

P.S. The tool I tried is in private beta. It’s insane, you can request to join their beta access here - [itsrank.com](http://itsrank.com/)",0,1750245790.0,SmallYoutubers,3,0.22,False

and i belive i know alot more the most of the ppl about skin care (  i maybe wrong )

this is the reason i think i know alot about skin care 

and this is how i started doing skin care 

soo basically when i was in 10th grade my brother got chicken pox for the first time and my mom told me to stay away from him and didn't and i got it too 

and i got really severe chickpox , like for normal ppl it stay for a week and then it goes but for me it didn't goo i had the pox for like more than 2 weeks 

and i'm not talking about the marks i'm talking about the whole pimple like thing

and it was full of the ewwww liquid puss 

it took time but they fade but it  took a hell lot of time and my face had shit tones of marks even tho i never poped any of them on my own 

and my self confidence was soo low at that time 

and to fix it i tried everything ppl said and guess what nothing worked , not even  a slight change 

i had put soo many stuff ppl said from besan to coffee and dahi and hell lot of stuff 

not gonna name everthing but did it for a year and nothing worked 

then i just accepted it and stoped doing all that BS and thought that my face is gonna change now 

( i meant the marks )    

and when i came in 11th once my cousin didi ( not a close one ) came and said why does my face look soo ugly and lot of stuff ( she didn't say it in a mean way but she was really concerened about it ) 

and said that its nothing  but puberty but she said but this is look soo bad

and she told me mother to take me to a skin doc and my mother did that 

the doc was really nice and good with me 

and that this is not how i look and this is just temporary 

i though that she said that just to make me feel better 

i told her everything i did to  my skin to fix it after the pox 

but no i was wrong , she really meant that , 

i  had hyperpigmentaion around and below my lips ( reason was coz of coffee use to open my pores and i  didn't put any moistuzer after that so alot of dirt came in ) 

white head on my noes and on my chin 

uneven skin tone 

my chicks were full of acnes and chicken pox marks 

and i had combination skin ( not dry skin and not hydrated skin ) 

the first thing she told me to do is use a gentle face wash when i bath and before sleeping and after a come from outside and not to forget to put sun screem before going out 

and after using the face wash she told to put moistuzer on my face  

she also recommended me to applu aloe vera gel before sleeping ( but sometimes i missted that ) 

its not over yet , she also gave me list of serums that i should put on my face 

but she told me to that i should use these serums once i make a habbit of washing and moistuzing my face like brushing my teeths 

i followed it as she said i could see that my skin felt better ( but i still had all those prob ) 

now comes the best parts 

the magic 

the serums 

ohhhhhh boi serums are like magin like litrally dude 

soo enough of hyping serums and here what i serums u used ( i'll say the name and how i used them coz the above part is allrealy pretty huge ) 

1st serum = 0.5% conc of kojic acid ( for hyperpigmentaion ) after washing face and before putting moiztuzer 

2nd serum = 5% conc of vitamic c serum ( to even the skin tone and keep my face hydrated ) 

after the first serum and before moiztuzer 

i used this these 2 for a month as she said 

my skin now felt super good and looks good too but it still had some prob 

after that 

3rd = 2% conc of kojic acid ( same thing as the first serum but with high conc for even better and fast result ) 

4th = transexamic acid and salacilic acid 2% ( to remove scares , acne marks , and white heads ) 

after washing face and before moiturizing 

5th = niacinamide ( i haven't used this one but she told me once i grow up then this would be really good ) 

and currently i have no acnes , no white heads , a good hydrated skin with even tone , the hyperpigmentaion is stll kinda there but i think its 90% gone only a little is left beside my the left side of my lips 

i still have those bloddy chicken pox marks but they are not visible and guess what they are kinda fading away a little 

i m really happy now and feel alot confident too and everyone gives me a compliment about my skin too 

as i  said in the title u can ask me and all this is just a summary about what i  did

Hello, I'm new here

Do you want to have a peek
at my world?

to a parallel world, or something similar?

I'll show you

Since I experienced beyond what's in the unified world.

I am diagnosed with schizophrenia several years ago

I'll tell you all the things I wish I have known
sooner

First stage
My thoughts seems to be broadcasted in public
I feel like all my actions were being watched

Second stage
Chaotic mind, from waking up to sleep, my mind is polluted with noise

Third stage
I'm hearing voices in my mind, not heard by others
These voices are entirely foreign,
not coming from me

Fourth stage
The bullying happens, then more bullying

Fifth stage
denial taking prescriptions

Sixth stage
Horror happens
Whenever I'm about to sleep,
my breathing slows down until it stops
Messed-up mind
Feeling the body moving on its own
More bullying


Here's some of what happens to me during psychosis and my analysis of it

>The increased activity of voices in my mind and more drama
I categorized them into three
The external voices
The external voices that hides behind self
The one with the highest chance of
being the true self

What are they?

The external voices - Type A
At the early stage, they sound distant but grows louder depending on the severity of situation.


The external voices that hides behind self
Type B
This is the voice that pretends to be the ego, or self
just like the rubber hand illusion, these external voices are voicing out my immediate thoughts so that I would think they are mine
Sometimes, I caught it still yapping even I'm already half-asleep
When I woke up from light sleep, it was already yapping even before my mind catch up to what it was saying
It has strong connection to the self
I frequently forgot it wasn't mine

These two types are an effective combination to bully me

Example
I was enjoying quiet time
My mind is exploring some ideas
Trigger comes out e.g. loud noise
Type B voices appear and provoke anyone else
In my world, what I hear in my mind is public
Neighborhood replies with more triggers
e.g. neighbors ridicule me, car horn, insulting and perfectly-timed animal sounds
Type B voices provoke them more, guiding my thought to what they want me to think
like crimes, revenge, that kind of plots
Type A voices will join the fray and create more drama
Type A and Type B just having casual stupid war, with the neighborhood as the source of sound effects
Since I'm conditioned that Type B is my own, just thinking about this is not to escape from emotional suffering


And Type C
This is the voice I hear in my mind when I think I'm normal. It's weak and silent voice. During psychosis, I think it's the most suspicious one

>Some objects will be trashed
It happens frequently during that time range, whether intentional or accidental

>Breathing out of control
During the peak of bullying, sometimes my breathing just stops, I have to be mindful and breathe on my own for a while.
Diaphragm breathing is very helpful for me, I just think that whenever I do it, my body and mood will feel better.

>The prohibited diet and craving
This, I have no control. Even I know it's bad for me, it's what's available on the table.
One time I was under schizo attack, I've researched that the meal I've eaten can be a trigger too. Corn and coffee. They are taboo.

>new unwanted memories
no need to explain

>the feeling of the body being controlled by unknown
this only happened to me a few times, I expected it to happen anyway since I've read about it
I'm amazed at first, until it tried to harm me, later I was brought to hospital and stayed there for a week


I just have to create my own defense to feel better

I know that there are others who experience this that can be found in prison, or asylum. I've even watched an interview how one was just fighting back against the other's harassments. He was even hated in their community. So I know that like the others, harassment is a common occurrence and everybody else are just jailbaits. I just have to escape from my reality and distract myself with video games.

Distraction is the easiest remedy. Whenever I am focused on doing something, there's high chance that I won't experience any phantom bullying. 

Without taking medicine, it will be hard to practice meditation and mindfulness, which is good for self-reflection and calming myself.

Exercise and taking bath also makes me motivated for a short while so it's good too.

Also, I don't know if it's unique to me but it's bad to use earphones during attacks, there'll be annoying inserts not originally in the song, I also still hear the type A voices even with loud volume. The worst is when there are silent gaps between songs. Silence is taboo, no matter what occasion. If unavoidable, just listen to radio channels that skip silence.

I think no matter our past, we'll suffer the same. 

All I know is it's not all bad, I think I've explored more of my world because of these voices.

Not the storytelling. The soul-crushing, repetitive, 12-hour-day kind of editing.

The game has changed. Great AI tools now give you both speed & control. This isn't about replacing creativity, it's about automating the grunt work so you can finally be a full-time creator.

I found a tool that’s like Cursor for video editing, where you can edit your video with text prompts.

As a test, I gave it a 1 hour podcast and a single prompt:

""Remove all silences over 0.5s, cut out every 'um' & 'like'. Trim background noise. Cut to a close-up every time the guest starts talking. Export a 15-min highlight reel with key moments only.”

The entire rough cut was rendered in under 3 minutes. It processed and delivered a clean rough cut in less than 3 minutes. 3 MINUTES.

A task that normally takes me 3-4 hours of soul-crushing work was done before I could finish my coffee. This is how it 10x my workflow.

I didn't build this tool, and I'm not selling anything. I'm just sharing this because it feels like a fundamental change.

Our value as editors is no longer in our speed with hotkeys, but in our creative direction. The machine can do the labor, we provide the vision.

If you’re an editor and still drowning in manual edits, you need to check this out. The game is different now.

Have anyone used something like that before? Please share your experience below. I'm curious to know what everyone thinks.

P.S. The tool I tried is in private beta. It’s insane, you can request beta access here - [itsrank.com](http://itsrank.com/)",0,1750245175.0,SaaS,4,0.11,False

**Memory Transcription Subject: Tiltva. Venlil Singer in training at Little Branson.** 

**Date: \[Standardized Human time\] February 18, 2138**

I watch him stand there stupidly at the edge of the street as Raymond’s car takes me and a few other employees into the sky. Just before Halin becomes an indecipherable dot on the ground, I see him startle at something behind him. A light giggle bubbles in my chest as I turn my gaze out onto the golden-glowing lake. Feeling a bit obligated for conversation with my coworkers, I turn my view back inside the car but see everyone is already absorbed into their pads for the commute to Little Branson.

*I guess I don’t do a lot of talking with them during our flights anyway. Usually it's just Halin and me watching Bleat and MyHerd videos together.*

*Halin…*

*He’s been so much more… Close. Yeah, ""close"" is the word. He’s been so much closer since that day we spent swimming Ray and Thyla, but he’s still so avoidant! Breathe, the plan is still in motion; I got this.*

\------

I quickly step out of the car to get out of everyone’s way as we arrive at work. We all quickly split to our separate tasks, but I have a particular task that’s the envy of the whole company.

First meal with the owner and his daughter.

Normally it is just on virtue of tagging alongside Halin as he’s Ray’s right-tail man running the business, but Thyla insisted that I come anyway for first meal this waking. 

Unlocking the door with my own pad this time, I step inside the Oakley residence and take a deep, tasting breath as I take ear to the [speedy tunes](https://youtu.be/AgPITdW3lRA) lofting out of the kitchen. On the air, flavors of cooked fruits and warm strayu flood my tongue, and I nearly let my mouth water at the thought of another one of Raymond’s meals. Strangely, I don’t taste anything savory in the air.

*Huh, Raymond must not want any meat or meat substitute for myself or Thyla this paw. Oh Stars, here I am wondering why there isn’t meat to eat. Not long ago I sold the supplies that would be used to deal with someone with those thoughts. This cycle has been a wild ride…*

Before I can reminisce too hard on my old job, a small missile hits my midsection, nearly knocking the air out of me. Instinctively, I lean down and wrap my arms tight around the fluffy and clothed little menace. Luckily giving me time to catch my own breath back, Thyla steps back and, with a wagging tail, waves at me. I notice this paw she has on another new dress, but this one has a few different parts with a white, short-sleeved top part and a knee-length blue cloth skirt.

“Mornin’ Tiltva!”

“Warm waking, Thyla! I love your dress! How is your paw so far?”

Thyla’s ears and snout turn a light blue as she twirls her dress for me quickly before resuming.

“It’s good! Dad said he thinks you’ll like his breakfast. Are you hungry?”

“Now that you mention it, I *am* hungry. Do you need any help setting the table?”

“No, I can do it.”

Following Thyla as she heads back into the kitchen and dining room area, I see Ray hovering over a baking dish on the stove as Thyla starts collecting plates and utensils for the table. Ray turns around and gives a wave before lowering the volume of the music and talking back at me despite still messing with the dish in front of him.

“Mornin’, Tiltva. Got any bruises on your stomach from that kiddo yet?”

I quickly run a paw across my belly and feel the slight tenderness from Thyla’s favorite impact zone.

“She doesn’t jump at me that hard…”

“...”

Ray’s silence speaks volumes as he completely stops his motion in obvious doubt at my statement.

“Okay, being completely honest, I checked last time because I thought there’d be one for sure this time, but nothing. Anyway, she can give me all the Thyla hugs she wants. I think she and I benefit from them equally.”

“Well, appreciate you treating my girly nice.” He turns to look at Thyla in the other room, ears raised as she *very* conspicuously listens in to us. “And Thyla, don’t think I don’t know you’re listening! Tiltva said you jumping at her hurts. Apologize, or she’ll stop letting you do it!”

Ray then takes an insulated mitt and picks up the dish he had been working on as he also grabs another tray with slices of toasted strayu and small wedges of what I’d learned is called avocado and others of lime citrus.. Noticing that the table is just missing drinks, I step to the refrigerator and pull out three pitchers, one of water, one of sugary lemon citrus juice, and the other with *milk*…

Joining the two at the table, we fill our own glasses as Raymond points towards his two dishes. The steaming dish is filled with slices of brown-speckled golden fruit, and with another scenting breath, I get a sharp sense of spice from the dish.

“Alright, Tiltva, this mornin’ we have apple crisp, which is baked apple slices with some cinnamon and oats, real sweet and nice. The other is toast with some avocado slices. Put the avocado on the toast with a bit of salt, pepper, and a drip or two of lime juice. Savory side of breakfast. And of course, milk for Thyla and myself only unless you want to take another try at it, Tiltva?”

I feel my stomach try to twist itself into knots to prevent entry of the potent white liquid before I quickly laugh it off with a flick of ‘Absolutely not’ with my ears and tail. As we dig into first meal, I hover my hand over my stomach again from where the bubbly little girl had jumped into me. As I do, I notice her focus right on me. I flick a ‘What?’ to which she flicks back a ‘Hurt? I’m sorry.’

*Aw, she is sweet. Good thing she isn’t a Venlil pup, though; otherwise, that’d be a much harder head to take to the chest.*

“I’m fine, Thyla, thank you. You guys just got back from Earth again, right? How do you like going to Earth now, Thyla?”

“Oh, I really like it there! Dad’s-I mean ***my*** family lives in these hills called the Ozarks, in Missouri, in the United States of America, which means they have more than just the big UN government; they have a country and a smaller country-thing inside that! Oh, it’s also really cold there during this season. Oh, and ***my*** family is all really touchy with me. They keep hugging and kissing me all the time! They’re really nice, I guess…”

*I’m sure she gets plenty of attention there as a family member given how much of a hit she is here with the humans. Huh, maybe half of the Venlil-Farsul tension is just Farsul taking just as much attention from humans?*

“That sounds like a wonderful time, Thyla. The flights there and back aren’t too bad, I assume?”

“Well, it takes five hours from Mirror Lake City to St. Louis, and then two hours on the train, and then the same back to Mirror Lake City when we leave, so it’s a lot of sitting around, but I keep sleeping for a lot of it.”

Raymond giggles with some food in his mouth as he quickly washes it down.

“By ‘sleeping,’ she means using me as a pillow while my hands go numb scratching at her head and ears for half of a day. It’s good though; everyone at home loves their Thyla. Anyhow, I think it’s time you get going, kiddo. School starts in an hour.”

Thyla's eyes widen before she scarfs down another few spoonfuls of apple crisp and then downs her glass of milk. She then bolts over to her backpack on the wall and nearly out of the house door but stops in her tracks. She then sprints back to us and wraps Ray in a hug.

“Bye, Dad, love you!”

“Love you too, have fun at school.”

*Those two are just so adorable. I wonder if anyone thought the same of Dad and I…*

With just the two of us now at the table mostly finished with first meal, Raymond turns his attention to me.

“So, Halin is out on an orthopedic appointment again. What are your plans for the day? Just practice on your own again and then together at our normal time? Still working on your ‘plan,’ right?”

“Yeah, plans for the paw are to practice on the stage before second meal and then after that join up with everyone around for main practice.”

“Sounds like a plan. Don’t worry about helpin’ with clean-up. I’ll handle it.”

“Are you sure you don’t want help?”

“I’m sure. Have some fun, good luck.”

With an ear-flick goodbye, I step up from the table but make sure to bring my own plate and glass into the kitchen despite Ray’s assurances otherwise. Only then do I leave the house and make my way over to the old ipsom barn containing what might be the only ‘Honky Tonk’ on Skalga. Slipping in through the employee entrance, I enter near the stage and release a happy sigh as I look out over the glowing dance hall. No artificial lights shine, as only the sunlight from the windows lights the barn. Stopping to listen and look for anyone else inside, I neither see nor hear anyone or anything.

*Good. Just me and this music. Ray’s song while cooking has me inspired; the ‘bluegrass’ songs do need more practice, but first I better focus on my set.*

I step on the stage and walk to the center, where a small stand waits. Booting up my translated music app on my pad, I connect to the hall speakers and set the pad in front of myself on the stand. I reach to my own ear and turn off the translator as the [steel guitar and regular guitar kick in](https://youtu.be/VVXnQSia_VE), and I mentally morph from Tiltva the ~~failure~~ anxious, to Tiltva the ~~confident~~ singer. I take a final deep breath and roll into my part.

\------

Song after song fills the hall, but before long I come upon the [end of my assigned practice set](https://youtu.be/DRtNXfwIn3Y). As I finish out the last note to match the twangy human instrument, I nearly jump into the air in fright as I hear a single set of tail thumps and whistles from within the dance hall. I look out to see a short old lady I’m all too familiar with getting herself a drink from behind the bar. Out of habit, I quickly turn my translator back on before yelling at her.

“Brelkam! You nearly scared the tail off of me!”

“Well, I couldn’t stand to interrupt you while you were doing such a wonderful job singing! You really do sound like a human woman singing!”

I feel my face flush orange, but before I can eke out a reply, she quickly pours a second drink of a rather different composition than her own and sits it on the bar next to hers, and she bugles out to me as she waves me over.

“I know that look, dear; you’re about to say something like, ‘Oh, it’s really nothing. I still need to get a lot better,’ and while practice makes perfect, I’m a bit worried you might actually believe it’s ‘nothing.’ Am I right, darling?”

*Direct hit. I still am not great. I think…*

“Spot on, actually.”

“I thought so. Now why don’t we share a drink and let your deep, pretty voice take a break?”

*Huh, that might be the first time a Venlil aside from my closest friends called my voice pretty… Wait, drinks?*

I take a seat next to Brelkam as I look down at my short glass of amber liquor with a small red fruit at the bottom, while she has her own glass filled with a liquid nearly the color of my stripes.

“Is Ray alright with us having drinks on the job?”

“‘Us’ having drinks on the job? Dear, you’re the employee, not me. I just bum food and drinks off the boy.”

“Well, that’s very nice of Ray, I guess.”

“Oh, it’s not, *not* paid for. My little Beg is kind enough to pay for her old mother’s tab with that big Chief Exterminator salary that she has. It’s not like she’s using it on a mate or grandpups…”

“Grandpups… Is Kam your only one?”

“That human want-to-be? No, he has a sister that is off doing who-knows-what in Dayside City for her Assistant Magistrate position. But those are my only two, with no sign of great-grandpups coming anytime soon. Unless you and Kam…”

My tail sinks as I can feel my face instantly flush a deep, sad orange at the statement.

“I-uh-Miss Brelka-”

Her serious demeanor only lasts for a moment before she breaks into whistles with her ears flicking all around.

“You should see the look of your tail and ears, dear! Oh my Stars, I got you good! Me and this whole compound know that you are after that Halin boy.”

*The whole place…*

“Everyone knows? Then why doesn’t Halin?”

“He’s just nervous. It’s silly from our perspectives, but I’d wager he’s just worried about not wanting to create any distance between you two.”

*I guess I haven’t exactly helped with that in the last cycle.*

“That’s why I have a plan. A plan I’ll enact very soon.”

“Oh my, now you’re scheming like my Beg. Tiltva, you have really grown into a bold young woman since we first met. Well, ignoring you giving that big ol’ lick to Halin at the Christmas party, that was pretty bold.”

As I finish my glass, the thought of what Brelkam’s milky-colored drink could contain finally breaks my curiosity.

“That means a lot, Brelkam, but I do have to ask, what is your drink, and why did you make me a different one?”

“Oh, this? This is a White Russian: good strong liquor mixed with coffee liqueur and milk cream.”

“Milk cream? Are you like Thyla, and you can actually drink that stuff?”

“Oh Stars, no dear, it makes me all types of gassy, but there’s no nose on this old Venlil, so it’s not really my problem.”

We simultaneously break out into deep whistling laughter as the absurdity of her statement echoes through the dance hall.

“Brelkam, that might be the funniest thing said to me in a whole herd of paws; the best part is I know you’re not lying.”

“Not lying even a bit. Now are you going to do another song?”

“Actually, I think I’ll get second meal before getting to the late paw practice with Ray.”

“Enjoy your meal, dear. Have a nice paw.”

“You as well, Brelkam!”

As I leave my glass on the bar and head back out of the dance hall, I take a quick moment to just close my eyes and feel the warmth of the sun and the humid breeze flowing off the lake. The crunching of shoes and paws on the paths around the site alerts my ears to the first patrons of the paw heading over to the restaurant. In the crowd I see a healthy mix of Venlil in with the normally strong human crowd during paws like this. My moment of silent relaxation done, I walk behind a small group and enter the restaurant with them.

With a flick of my tail to the Yotul hostess girl, I enter the human side of the building and take a seat at yet another bar. Around this side of the room, various types of meats are being consumed with all of the stealth and grace of a Mazic in a ceramic shop. My stomach briefly bubbles at the sight of bones in one man’s food before I quickly turn to just the bar itself. I wave to the bartender and give a light shout for my order of Ittelian icewine and a plate of preserved, sweetened stringfruit strands.

As I wait for my small meal to be served, I notice a human man take a seat beside me. Still not allowed in most places on Skalga, Ray’s property has no rules requiring face masks, allowing me to see the man staring hard into the side of my head as I stare off the wall mirror into the room behind me. 

“So, Miss? Miss right?”

*Oh, he’s talking to me, isn’t he?*

“Are you asking if I am a miss?”

“I-uh. How are you doing today?”

“I’m doing well, I guess. How are you, sir?”

“Great. I mean, I’m good... So, I don’t really see too many aliens on this side of the restaurant because of the, you know, but here you are.”

*Meat? Yeah, it’s weird, but even I eat some fake stuff sometimes.*

“Yep, here I am.”

“So, will you be here all day for the dance hall to open up? Because I was thinking that maybe we-”

*Oh brahk, he’s asking me on a date!* 

“Wait, we? Sir, sorry, I’m already taken.”

“Oh... Sorry, have a nice day.”

*Stars, I was not expecting that at all, and I* ***am*** *taken as far as I’m concerned.*

I watch the man return to his friends, who split into half of the group laughing at his expense while the other half consoles him for my shutdown. I notice the bartender bringing my food over with a speh-eating grin. Before I can even tell him to shut up, a familiar gray-wooled man with a cowboy hat and boots walks in, arms loaded with three boxes. He drops them off in the recently vacated chair beside me and quickly begins to unpack them without even a word to me.

“Kam! Is that what I think that is?”

“Yes, yes’n, howdy, and a fine good paw, Tiltva. Quite literally just got’en these delivered, and Ray tol’ me to find you and han’ ‘em over. So ‘ere’s you hat, boots, and dress. Yippee.”

Standing out of my stool, I take the smooth, knee-length red dress and without a care for the eyes of the room, I throw it on, taking a moment to make sure it sits well on my shoulders and gives my tail clearance. Then I take the white, synthetic-skin boots and put them on my feet, followed quickly by the white fur-felt hat on my head with clearance for my ears to go through the cutouts. Looking back at the mirror behind the bar, I twirl myself back and forth to gauge the outfit. A loud thunk echoes across the room as I look to see the human man from earlier has let his head drop onto the table with a groan.

*At minimum, this outfit has one fan.*

“Well, Tiltva, up to snuff?”

“It still feels weird on my tail, I think.”

“It’s a dress; that’s what dresses feel. Anyhow, congrats on da outfit. Ray said to meet ‘em at the house when you’re ready. ‘is meetings are done fer the paw.”

“Thank you, Kam. I-I, does it look nice at least?”

“Lookn' great, but am not exactly ‘un unbiased opinion on this’n type ‘o clothes.”

*There goes his accent change again. He can’t keep it straight even after all this time practicing…*

“Yeah, that’s right. See you later, Kam.”

“Farewell, Tiltva.”

Still in my new outfit, I retake my seat at the bar and watch as Kam takes the empty boxes away, leaving me to actually eat my second meal. Looking at myself in the mirror at the bar, I again catch a few stray gazes and even a not-very-subtle picture being taken of me as I eat and drink my small meal. A nervousness begins to bubble in my chest again at the attention, so I quickly finish up and wave bye to the bar staff as I exit the restaurant and start back over towards Ray’s house.

Just as I am getting close to his front porch, I hear the telltale thin hum of the hovercar coming in to land. I stop in my tracks and look behind me to see a familiar Farsul pup quickly throw open the car door as the screen door to the house now creaks open behind me. The little girl’s eyes light up as she sees me, and she comes running with her pack bouncing wildly like her long ears. I brace for a tackle that never comes as she much more softly hugs me and quickly releases.

“Hello, Tiltva! School let out early today!”

“Oh, why’s that?”

“There were some people protesting down the street, so they sent us all home. It’s alright because I finished my homework already while—Oh, your clothes! You look like Hilda when she—OH! Dad! I’m home!”

Thyla then sprints past me and jumps the last few tails of distance up and into her father’s arms. He lightly spins in place while pulling her tight into his chest. The force of the spin has no power over her tail as it flails wildly behind her as he stops the spin and sets her back on the ground.

“Welcome home, girly. How was school?”

“It was okay. You had the car pick me up because of the protest, but it was really fine because it wasn’t against me. Oh, Dad, we didn’t eat lunch because of it; can you make something?”

“Sure thing, let’s get something going.”

Ray rubs the top of her head as he begins to walk inside with her trailing close behind. He stops for a moment to look back at me, and with a wave over his shoulder to the door, he calls out.

“Come on, Tiltva, I think kiddo here would love to tell you about her day over lunch, and then we can get started. Your outfits looks great, by the way. Good choices for sure.”

I flick an ear in agreement and then in thanks and make my way towards the house. Thyla again gives her dad another big hug as they cross the house. The way they interact sends a pang of longing in my heart.

*Oh, how I miss being in Thyla’s spot…*

*But that’s not to say I can’t be in Ray’s if things all go to plan. Just follow the plan…*

Context: Your crush, who had a mental breakdown right on the first date, has fled to his house. With the help of Jerry, the waiter in the cafe, you found out his house. Curiosity got the upper hand and you decided to pay him a visit. What is awaiting you behind that wooden door?

\[Muffled sad piano, sobbing sound\]

\[Muffled, table slamming\] Stupid…stupid…stupid…Why did I do that? What would she think of me?

It’s so over now! It’s always so!

I knew it…I knew it…it’s always so

\[Sob, long pause\]

…I guess…it all comes back to how it used to be

\[Footsteps\]

\[Drawers opening\]

\[Slashing sound\]

\[Grunts in pain\]

\[Knock on the door\]

\[Gasp\]

What!

Ummm…ummm…Coming!

\[Footsteps\]

\[Open the door\]

Oh heyyyy\~ \[Awkward laugh\]

Good afternoon…

Sorry for leaving you alone at the cafe, ehehe…\[Sniffle\]

I realized that I had something to do at home

How did you know I live here?

\[Pause\]

Jerry? Oh…right…

Ummmm…So? Did I give you enough money to pay for the drinks?

\[Pause\]

W-wonderful that it was

Ummmmm…would you mind if I asked you to go home?

I still have something to do

\[Listener says no\]

No? What do you mean no? \[Sniffle\]

\[Mumbles and fast\] Gosh my nose is runny…

I mean

Don’t you have things to do?

Well…I suppose you don’t because this is summer

W…well \[Sniffle\]

H-how about we go out now?

I-I can make up for you. Let’s go grab some boba or perhaps ice cream \[Sniffle\]

Bad…timing

No n- Don’t touch i-…

\[Grunt in pain\]

\[Listener immediately pulls back and apologizes\]

N…no, it’s not your fault dear… just, please

Wait stop! Babe don’t go inside!

\[The listener gets inside. The curtains are closed. The room is completely dark with the only light source comes from the TV which is playing some melancholic melodies of piano. On the coffee table lays a bunch of paper scattered around and a razor blade with a hint of blood on it. The whole room sends shiver down the listener’s spine\]

Gosh…you have seen it, right?

The knife…the blood…the paper…\[Sniffles\]

\[Pause\]

What are those papers?

My diagnosis of…depression as you can see there \[Sniffle\]

Schizoaffective disorder…

…

And the knife…

Well, I guess you know what happened

Frankly, those stupid anti-depressants doesn’t fix anything

Sure, they work for a month or two

But then…it’s all just pure willpower to resist the temptation to…you know…something dangerous \[Last sniffle\]

\[Listener rushes inside the bathroom and scrambles the drawer. She spots a roll of bandages and a half-empty bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide. They then speeds to the speaker\]

\[She asks why there is Hydrogen Peroxide in the drawer\]

Why do I have that bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide?

Ummmmm…I’m not an old-schoolers

I…just want to torture myself even more whenever I cut myself like this…

Shocked…right?

I’m a masochist at heart…

Now…can we just quit chatting and move on to the real torture?

I really crave for some pain now…

\[The Listener hesitates\]

Please…just do it…and you can go home instead of dealing with me…

\[The listeners shakes. She questions why do the speaker want to push her away\]

Because if you stay, I will just bother you more, dummy

Now pour it on me, please!

\[The listener questions about why he’s afraid to bother her\]

Well…I don’t want to bother you is because it’s annoying for you

Dealing with a depressed boyfriend…would be a pain for the brain

Especially when they are delusional and won’t seek for help

I know it because I’ve gone through it enough times to learn this bloody lesson

\[Pause\]

You thought this was my first time dating someone?

\[Huff\] Honey, this is like the third time already…

It will leave some scars, a lot of them…

Well, I will just…continue to wear baggy shirts like usual

You see why I always wear long sleeves to school?

That and the sun are roasting me like grilled chicken…but I refuse to wear ANYTHING else

No tanktop, no being shirtless in swimming classes, no t-shirt, only long sleeves

\[Steady breaths\]

\[Long pause\]

You can go home if you want…it’s getting really late out there now

Stubborn as I am…

Fine, if you want to stay to protect me, then I won’t force you. Do whatever you please

I will go clean the mess…

\[Act like nothing just happened and a bit cold\]

What? What are you staring at?

You want to see other scars?

Heh, here you go

\[Rolling up the sleeves\]

\[Short pause\]

See? Nothing special…just long and shallow scars

Oh and over here, on my shoulder, you can see something like a burnt mark. That was when I rubbed it and burnt the wound

\[Pause\]

I’m crazy?

Heh…For someone who wants to end himself…I would say it’s still amateur

\[Pause\]

\[Teasing attitude\]

What? Scared? Wooooooooooo

Scary scars and stories, woooooooo might wake you up at night, woooooooooo

\[The listener’s confused, why am I so indifferent about all the things just happens\]

Why am I so indifferent?

It happens usual darling. I’m used to it now

Especially when sick…

With severe migraines, exhaustion, ugh…those things

\[Long pause\]

You know what? You are quite dumb to love me

After all of this, you still want to stay

Are you a masochist like me?

Or a certain builder that can to fix anything?

\[Mocking tone\] **CAN WE FIX IT?**

TCH!…And my answer? No!

That’s not going to happen

So grow up, become a woman for once and leave. the. house

…

I’m being rude?

I’m being honest with you

You. can’t. fix. anyone

If they don’t want to be fixed, you can’t do so for them

\[Mumbles\] Speaking from experiences here

Hm? I didn’t say anything

Oh and, are you hungry?

\[Stomach growls\]

Right…I will take that as a yes

Let me cook something for you

Something easy like…steak?

Is that good for you?

You stay here, think about your decision and I will cook for you

No help, no but, no nothing. Just…thinking

Remember this: ”You owe me nothing. But if you *do* stay… I’ll cook. And if you leave… I understand it’’

And don’t forget…to keep your mouth shut about today

I…don’t really want to be sent into that hospital again…

My friend didn't return my schoolbooks in time and shut down everytime I mentioned it.,"So to understand the situation, I have to explain some things first. I'm currently in a apprenticeship where we are studying six months in school and then doing an internship for the rest of the year. The whole thing is during three years. My friend started the school semester while I already went to the internship. 

We are/were friends since almost four years, we worked together, shared many things with eachother and spent now and then our freetime together. We live like 45min apart by car, spontaneity could be difficult sometimes.

She still needed some schoolbooks that we are required to have in the school semester. I already bought those, because I already needed them obviously. And I needed a new book for the next school semester, which she had to buy too. So we made a deal: She can take my school books for this semester and when we switch (me to school - her to internship) we exchange the books again and I can use the one she had to buy. 

All went fine, we even met once for dinner in this time. About a week in advance to my school semester I texted her how we want to manage it, if we want to meet for a coffee or whatever so we could chat and exchange the books. She texted me, she was too busy and wont find any time at the moment. 

Okay, no problem I thought. I've waited about two or three weeks, I was in school again. I've heard nothing from her, so I texted her again something like this: Hey, how is it now? I'd be glad if I'd get the books soon. If it doesn't work out to meet, you could send me pictures from the codes inside so I could use the online accsess.

I can't really remember all of our texts because it was on Snapchat and got deleted right after. But her answers always seemed more or less passive aggressive when it came to those books. She said she would bring them to my house if it's so important and urgent. 

In the meantime I had to buy the book I would've borrowed from her. So now I just wanted my own books back. Anyways now it's three months into my school semester (so already half time) and I still haven't got an answer or anything from her on how I get my books back. So I texted again:

Me: Hi I would be glad if you could put all of my books outside on saturday so I can come get them. I'd be thankful if they were outside in the morning so I can stay flexible when I can come.

(I was left on read even though she was at home lying in her bed she sent me a snap lol, 8h later I texted again) Me: Is it working like this?

The next morning I got a text back: Good morning \[m/n\], I'm happy to hear from you, yes I'm doing good and how are you? Of course I will do that if you ask this nice! I'm going to put them in a plastic bag and send you a photo. Have a nice day.

I was furious. She has the audacity to tell me indirectly I'm not friendly and don't care for her? (Atleast that's how I see it. I had to translate it, I hope it has the same meaning in a passive aggressive way lmao)

After I calmed down I texted her a Thank you and wish you a nice day too. On the day we agreed I drove to her house and finally got my books, without seeing or talking to her. After I got home I texted her a Thank you again but never got an answer back. Now we are no contact.

I'm just so confused and angry and I can't stop to think what I could have done to hurt her? But even if I did something, shouldn't she tell me instead of giving me an attitude?

By slowly rendering thick-cut Applewood-smoked bacon with caramelized onions, balsamic vinegar, and a touch of brown sugar and coffee, this jam offers an incredible depth of umami flavor that elevates everything from gourmet burgers to artisan cheese boards. The deep, dark consistency and complex smoky-sweet profile make this homemade jam an irresistible culinary creation that blends rustic charm with sophisticated taste.\

1lee4v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1lee4v0/a_saas_idea_that_no_one_even_talk_about_it/,A SaaS idea that no one even talk about it,"First I need to great you guys because it's my first time I join a place where I see people fight the life not sitting in coffee shop saying ""ohhh well life is hard man , I can't do it"". Keep it up guys

  
About the SaaS idea I will try to explain it here , I've made like 60% of the job to validate that it can be implemented and it's the time to share it here , I hear people saying why are you sharing it and the answer is in Islam Allah said love to the others what you love to your self and be sure you will get better.

  
Let's start , first I'm a full stack developer with like 10 years experience , A coding is not typing code it's about reasoning , remember things , it's like training your self to turn an idea to reality 

I know I'm talking too much but that's necessary to explain the idea , If you ask your self why **vibe coders** or currently learning people struggle to guide **cursor** , **windsurf etc....** , all of them if you ask them why man , they will all answer that ""**He suggest this I don't know XD"" "" I don't know the technology we're using , cursor suggest it"" ""I don't know English very well man so how the hell I can explain what we've done previously"" ""Why he is forget what I said in the beginning of the coding session""** 

I've a friend of mine he  needs to start his degree final project using cursor after just one day he get  stuck , he was not able to explain the previous conversations , technologies used , problem with outdated docs because as you know cursor uses LLMs so they're not always up to date so they get stuck easily when a new hook get changes , package get moved or removed etc..... 

  
At this point the ones who reads this they're really interested and probably do you know things like MCP , NEO4J , GRAPH CONTEXT , EMBEDDINGS , VECTOR SEARCH 

The most working method to keep context is to make the LLM update a markdown file with the updates he is making so he can reference it in the next chat but this is a context consuming , for that here what you gonna do 

\- Use Nest Js with it's built-in mcp support

\- The tool you gonna create will be used by cursor , windsurf and any IDE editor 

For example you can receive the error message , the solution code , the reference file and other metadata all those will be passed by cursor , you can add as much tools as possible you can even add an LLM model and expose it as MCP tool like orchestrator so instead of the user make him understand what implemented in the previous coding sessions the LLM with the saved history will be able to understand everything , this mean instead of charging the cursor's context you use an external LLM to do the heavy job and much more tools and ideas can be implemented

  
This is the idea and still more , All I'm asking is a good word it's enough for me.",1,1750244322.0,SaaS,6,0.56,False

Okay, buckle up because I swear this sounds like a Wattpad story, but it actually happened.

About a 7 year ago, I 25 was *madly* in love with my best friend (let’s call him Sam). We had one of those painfully close friendships where everyone assumed we were already together. I had written a long, emotional message one night where I finally poured out everything how I’d fallen for him, how I couldn’t keep pretending to just be friends, and how terrified I was to lose him if he didn’t feel the same.

The plan was to sit on it, proofread the next day, and *maybe* send it after a bottle of courage. Instead, sleepy-me hit send… not to Sam… but to my classmate *Dan* a guy I barely knew outside of group projects.

Cue the full-body panic. I immediately tried to unsend it, but it was too late. Dan had read it. Then came his reply:

""Wow. I don’t think this was meant for me... but if it *was* I feel the same way.""

I was *mortified*. I explained the situation, apologized, and tried to laugh it off, but Dan wasn’t joking. He said my message made his heart race. That he had noticed me for months. That maybe fate was being weirdly generous.

We went for coffee a few days later just to clear the air. That ""coffee"" lasted 5 hours. We haven’t stopped talking since.

I never did confess to Sam. We drifted naturally, and I realized maybe the idea of him was bigger than the reality. Meanwhile, Dan has been my safe place, my partner, my person for 7 whole years.

Life is *so* weird. But sometimes, the wrong message finds the right person.

**TL;DR:** Tried to confess to my best friend. Sent it to a random classmate by accident. We’re now celebrating our 3-year anniversary.

Just a point to make - in the new pics there is clutter and living items and that's because we live here and aren't aiming for show room organised on a daily basis!

- changed the green walls to a light pink. This has immediately made the room brighter 
- moved the shelves to the kitchen extension and brought our dining table into the back half of the living room to create a dining space 
- put the desk at the front of the room 
- moved the coffee table to the kitchen extension to create a more intimate seating area in front of the fire
- put a light coloured runner rug from the door way to create a ""hallway"" 

Now, here's the fun bit. LITERALLY as we were panting the walls, I got a call from our estate agents saying we had people wanting to view it. So I arranged it for a few days later, quickly tidied and organised, and....they put an offer in and we accepted 🥳

So the pictures obviously didn't put these people off viewing it, but I like to think the changes we made cliched the offer.

I originally planned to go with Swiss Coffee by BM at full strength on my cabinets and 75% strength on my walls throughout the entire house. I have a powder room, two bathrooms and a laundry room that are interior rooms and will have no windows for natural light. Would Swiss Coffee still be a good choice? If not, please give me recommendations on another creamy white that won’t look yellow without natural light! I’m so worried it will pull too yellow in these bathrooms. If I change paint colors for these bathrooms, should I follow suit with the rest of the house? I think having two, possibly three, different shades of a creamy off white would be pretty odd. My range hood and kitchen island will be maple wood stained in special walnut. My home is facing north, I’m not sure how much that matters. These two bathrooms will have Aluma Marble laminate. The powder room and kitchen will be Calacatta Elysio.

Also, I’ve thought about doing white dove walls in these bathrooms (possibly even the whole house) and doing a darker painted cabinet. I thought about iron ore for my son’s bathroom and powder room. Maybe a mushroom color for my daughter’s bathroom? They’re very small children so I don’t plan on letting them pick haha we’d have bathrooms color drenched in purple and green if I did.

In the laundry room I plan to have brick floor in Old Orleans by Cherokee brick with either butcher block or Aluma Marble laminate.

She was like “you can literally earn tokens while flirting.” I rolled my eyes, laughed, and thought… why not! 

I didn’t expect anything serious. I mean, I’ve been on enough apps to know how these things go — weird DMs, too many “heys,” and the occasional “wanna link?” guy.

But then I matched with this guy whose first message was:
“You look like the type who ghosts people just to protect your peace. Am I wrong?”
I laughed way too hard. It was stupidly accurate. We ended up talking till 2 AM about life, love, chai vs coffee, and somehow even philosophy??

And it wasn’t just flirting. It was fun, flirty, slightly chaotic — but not creepy.

Not saying I’ve met the love of my life or anything. But for once, it felt like I wasn’t just being swiped. I felt seen.

Using a throwaway because my friends know me on here. 

So I (26M) am dating (26f) who we will call Helen. We met at our current workplace. Before I was seeing her I was seeing another woman in the office casually for about 6 months on and off, it was not exclusive, official or serious which I thought was clear to the woman, let’s call her Ella (25F). Ella was under the impression that we were dating, not gf or bf or anything but just dating. I must admit that I never made it clear that we weren’t exclusive or anything but I just assumed idk. (I may have been an asshole in that regard). Anyway fast forward to 5 months ago Helen starts working in the same department as me, Ella works in a different department but does the same thing essentially as Helen not me. We become very close, obviously with spending all this together and we realise we have developed feelings for each other. So she asked me out, I said yes and the rest is history. The next couple of weeks go by and I haven’t seen Ella like we used to as she has been quite busy but I wouldn’t have seen her anyway now that I am in a relationship, but I am still messaging her every now and then and sometimes we will have lunch together, Helen doesn’t know the entirety of our relationship so she had no issue with that and Ella had no idea I was seeing Helen at this point because I thought she was aware that we weren’t anything more than casual. Well I walk into the office with Helen after she spent a night at my place and we walk in holding hands and we go to our company “cafeteria” to grab coffee, still holding hands we walk in and Ella is sitting at the table with some colleagues and immediately I notice her eyes zone in on my hands with Helen and I’m close enough to see that she is about to cry, she gets up and rushes out. Again I’m still under the impression that we were casual but I guess I owed her a conversation instead of just blindsiding her with my new relationship. Besides all that Ella has been working really hard on a system at work which she has been doing in order to get a promotion and I’ve seen how she spent so much time on it, from me spending nights at hers and vice versa. Well I guess she submitted/implemented it the previous day and after seeing me and Helen, she asked for a personal day (found out through another colleague). Our boss comes down and asked who was responsible for the new system (I can’t really explain it as I don’t understand it lol, its some sort of coding thing) and Helen ended up saying it was her even though I know full and well it was Ella. My boss asks to speak with Helen, they go up and she comes out beaming about the fact she just got a promotion to her dream position. I said to her that she never made the system, Ella did and that she should tell our boss the truth but she is saying she can’t because she worked so hard to get this job and she will be fired if they find out she was lying. I know if I do something about it Helen will dump me and I kinda really like her so I don’t want that and I mean Ella can come in and prove that it was her I’m sure so I am just planning on letting it play out.

# Why Getting Found in Oxford is Harder Than Anywhere Else

Running a business in Oxford is a unique challenge. You're not just competing with the shop next door; you're competing with centuries of history, a global academic powerhouse, a booming tech scene, and a constant influx of tourists. The digital landscape is crowded, sophisticated, and incredibly noisy. When a potential customer searches on Google, they're met with a wall of results. Why should they see you?

The key to cutting through this noise is authority, and in the world of Google, authority is built with high-quality backlinks. These are links from other reputable websites that act as powerful endorsements. But acquiring them in the Oxford ecosystem is a monumentally difficult task if you rely on outdated, manual methods.

You search for ""Oxfordshire business blogs,"" ""tech news Oxford,"" or ""lifestyle bloggers in OX1,"" hoping for a breakthrough. Your list is a mix of university department pages that will never link to you, huge media outlets that ignore you, and tiny, irrelevant blogs.
* **Emails into the Ether:** You craft what you think are polite, professional emails and send them to your list. The result? Silence. You're competing for attention with global PR firms, university press offices, and thousands of others. Your email is just one of a thousand that a busy editor or academic will delete before their morning coffee.
* **The Prohibitive Cost of ""Expert"" Help:** You contact a digital marketing agency. They talk a good game, but their quotes are astronomical, often demanding thousands per month for a vague promise of ""building brand presence."" For a growing business in Summertown or a restaurant on Cowley Road, these fees are unsustainable.
* **The Hidden Dangers of ""Cheap SEO"":** In desperation, you see an offer for ""Guaranteed Page 1 Rankings."" These services almost always use black-hat techniques and toxic PBNs (Private Blog Networks). This is the SEO equivalent of a ticking time bomb. When Google discovers these schemes, your website won't just drop in the rankings—it will be removed entirely, a death sentence for any business.

This old way of doing things is a losing proposition. It's a resource-draining, morale-sapping grind that delivers pitiful returns. In a city as intelligent and fast-moving as Oxford, you need an equally intelligent approach to your marketing.

>""As a tech startup in Botley, we're competing on a global stage. We needed an SEO strategy that was as innovative as our product. Manual link building was a total non-starter. It felt like using a carrier pigeon in the age of fibre optics. We knew we needed an AI-driven solution to scale our visibility.""

# Why Getting Found in Oxford is Harder Than Anywhere Else

Running a business in Oxford is a unique challenge. You're not just competing with the shop next door; you're competing with centuries of history, a global academic powerhouse, a booming tech scene, and a constant influx of tourists. The digital landscape is crowded, sophisticated, and incredibly noisy. When a potential customer searches on Google, they're met with a wall of results. Why should they see you?

The key to cutting through this noise is authority, and in the world of Google, authority is built with high-quality backlinks. These are links from other reputable websites that act as powerful endorsements. But acquiring them in the Oxford ecosystem is a monumentally difficult task if you rely on outdated, manual methods. The 'old way' of doing SEO in Oxford is a recipe for frustration and wasted marketing spend.

# Why Your Business Is Invisible in Oxford (And Why It's Not Your Fault)

You have a brilliant business. You offer a superior product or service. Yet, when potential customers search online, you're nowhere to be found. Why? Because the Oxford digital landscape is one of the most competitive in the world. You’re not just competing against other local businesses; you're up against the immense digital footprint of the University of Oxford, multinational corporations, and a constant flood of high-budget marketing campaigns.

The key to breaking through is \*\*authority\*\*. In Google's eyes, authority is built with high-quality backlinks—links from other trusted websites. These are votes of confidence that tell Google you are a leader in your field. However, trying to earn these critical links using traditional methods is like trying to cross Magdalen Bridge at rush hour on a tricycle. It’s a slow, painful, and ultimately futile exercise. The old model for link building in Oxford is fundamentally broken.

# The Losing Strategy Almost Every Oxford Business Uses

If you've hired an [Oxford SEO agency](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-service/) or tried to do it yourself, this expensive tale of woe probably sounds familiar:

* Wasted Hours on Manual Prospecting: You or your staff spend countless hours searching for ""Oxfordshire business blogs,"" ""local news Oxford,"" or ""lifestyle writers in OX1."" You end up with a messy spreadsheet full of dead ends: university sites that don't accept guest posts, major news outlets with no public contact, and low-quality blogs that would do more harm than good.
* The Sound of Silence: You meticulously craft and send hundreds of outreach emails. The result? Crickets. Your messages are buried in inboxes already overflowing with spam, press releases, and pitches from global PR firms. Getting a single reply feels like winning the lottery.
* Astronomical Agency Fees: You get a quote from a traditional digital marketing Oxford agency. They want a four-figure monthly retainer for vague promises and a slow trickle of mediocre links. For most businesses in Headington or Cowley, this is an unjustifiable expense with no clear ROI.
* The Terrifying Risk of ""Cheap SEO"": You're tempted by a too-good-to-be-true offer for ""guaranteed rankings."" These services invariably use black-hat techniques and toxic Private Blog Networks (PBNs). This is the fastest way to get your website completely de-indexed from Google, effectively erasing your business from the internet overnight.

This outdated approach is a constant drain on your resources and a barrier to your growth. In a city built on innovation, it's time for an equally innovative marketing solution. It’s time for [AI link building](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/).

>""We're a professional services firm in North Oxford. We compete with long-established players with huge budgets. Manual SEO was a black hole for our time and money. We needed a scalable solution that delivered real authority, not just empty promises. AI was the only logical answer.""

# Ready to Stop Gambling with Your SEO?

If you're tired of wasting your marketing budget on strategies that don't deliver, it's time for a change. Discover how AI provides the predictability and power your business needs to thrive in Oxford.

# The Unfair Advantage: How AI Delivers SEO Dominance in Oxford

Imagine a world where your business has a team of a thousand brilliant SEO strategists. They work 24/7. They've read every website, blog, and publication relevant to the Oxfordshire market. They know exactly who to contact, what to say, and how to say it to earn your business the most powerful backlinks imaginable. This isn't a fantasy; it's the reality of AI Monstertools.

Our platform uses sophisticated artificial intelligence to execute a flawless link building campaign at a scale and precision that is humanly impossible. We go beyond simple automation; our AI is a thinking, learning system that understands the unique, intricate digital ecosystem of Oxford. It transforms link building from a game of chance into a science of predictable growth. Our [automated link building](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/) platform is designed for one thing: to get you results.

# How AI Masters the Oxford Market:

* Surgical Prospecting with Local Context: Our AI understands the nuances of Oxford's geography and culture. It knows a link from a Jericho food blogger is perfect for a local restaurant, while a mention on a tech site covering the Begbroke Science Park is invaluable for a B2B startup. It finds these hyper-relevant opportunities in minutes, not weeks. This is the core of our industry-leading backlink building software.
* Rigorous, Multi-Layered Vetting: We don't just look at a website's Domain Authority. Our AI analyzes over 50 data points: its organic traffic within Oxfordshire, the quality of its own backlink profile, its historical ranking trends, and social signals. This data-driven vetting process filters out 99% of low-quality sites, ensuring we only pursue links that will significantly boost your authority and rankings.
* Intellectually Honest, Hyper-Personalized Outreach: Generic email templates are the kiss of death. Our AI crafts bespoke outreach messages that command respect. It will reference a specific article, compliment the author's work, and propose a collaboration that offers genuine value. This intelligent, authentic approach is why we achieve response rates that are orders of magnitude higher than manual efforts.
* Building a Moat of Digital Authority: Every link secured by our AI does more than just boost your SEO. It builds your brand's reputation. When your business is featured on trusted local platforms, you become a recognized authority. This drives direct referral traffic, enhances brand trust, and creates a powerful competitive moat that your rivals simply can't cross. This is the ultimate goal of any serious [local SEO Oxfordshire](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-service/) campaign.

This is the new paradigm for success. While your competitors are stuck in the past, you can leverage the power of the best backlink software for 2025 to build an unassailable position at the top of the search results.

# Frequently Asked Questions About SEO in Oxford

# My business is on Cowley Road. How specific can the targeting be?

It can identify and target local food bloggers, community groups, music venue sites, and other East Oxford-centric platforms that are most relevant to your business. We help you become a landmark online, not just on the street.

# Can you help my business in Summertown and Jericho stand out?

Absolutely. Whether you're a boutique in Summertown or a trendy pub in Jericho, our AI can tailor its search. For Summertown, it will seek out upmarket lifestyle blogs and directories.

I like drinking coffee, but not spending too much time making it. I am usually in a rush (or multi-tasking making breakfast) when making morning coffee. I also use the instant hot water option from bambino quite a bit.

Basically I am quite happy feature-wise/workflow with the bambino, but looking to up the espresso quality. 

I was looking at Oracle Jet for some time, but I think I just couldn't justify the price. If there is an oracle jet without the grinder at a lower price, then that would be my perfect fit. I am wondering if a similar machine exists already? buying single boiler machines would slow down my workflow due to having to wait for it to switch from brewing to steaming, and I don't think I can justify spending 1k+ on heat exchanger machines

Hello everyone, this is the first time I am posting in this Subreddit. I'm having a hard time and I hope I will find some clarity simply by writing this. Before I begin with the main story, some much needed context to begin with.

I am 23-year old guy and broke with my girlfriend in March. She was the one who broke things off despite being in love with me (and me with her, of course) because she felt she was a mess and not able to contribute to this relationship (out of respect for her I won't go deeper into this, but there is a serious background). As difficult as it was, I had to accept that, but both of us left the door open and wanted to re-unite in the future. We stayed in moderate contact following our break-up, nothing too intense, and recently we agreed to meet-up soon to talk about us and everything.

Last week she went to a vacation with her sister and friend... I'm not going to try and rationalize what happened next - I decided to follow my heart and try and make something happen. I set upon a 800km journey to surprise her and see if she wants to take a walk, grab a coffee or anything really. I think I watched waay too many films 😂 When I boarded the final bus to my destination, I messaged her and revealed my intentions, but to my, (and hers) unpleasanant surprise, she was shocked by this move, said she feels like crap and that she feels like she is SUPPOSED to see me now I'm there.

Admittedly, I was blindsided by my emotions and projections, and what I did was absolutely  inconsiderate and disrespectful to her feelings, privacy and everything, I had good intentions, but this wasn't a smart decision. She invited me to a coffee in her apartment, but I politely declined, since it was evident she was not ready for this and I didn't want to make things any worse than they are. I apologized a couple of times, I truly regret making her feel that way, the fact that I am the source of her sorrow is shredding my heart.

I am writing this as I boarded the bus all the way back home. I dreaded this moment and have a lot of negative thoughts on my mind. I flew too close to the sun and lost my wings. I know I have the strenght to pull out of this and, eventually I will.

This may sound fucked up, as I truly regret the consequences of this ""adventure"", but I would do anything for her, and I would start doing it in a second! That's not going to change... So I will raise my chin up and be proud about that, while trying to work on my mistakes.

Now it's time to re-focus and re-build. Maybe I am a hopeless romantic, but love takes us to strange, and often unplanned directions. It's not the time (yet) to give up on this dream. People who love you are worth fighting for. But,  for now, the ball is on her side of the court, and I hope she passes it back.

I know I will probably get judged by the responses, if there will even be any, but this is my story, and I found some clarity by writing this. That alone won't get me over this hill, but it's a beginning. 

To everyone who got to the ending, thank you for reading this and I wish you nothing but a good, happy life blessed with people you love and cherish. 

At the end of the day, that's the important thing in adventure that is called life :)",74,1750242885.0,TrueOffMyChest,56,0.81,False

I originally planned to go with Swiss Coffee by BM at full strength on my cabinets and 75% strength on my walls throughout the entire house. I have a powder room, two bathrooms and a laundry room that are interior rooms and will have no windows for natural light. Would Swiss Coffee still be a good choice? If not, please give me recommendations on another creamy white that won’t look yellow without natural light! I’m so worried it will pull too yellow in these bathrooms. If I change paint colors for these bathrooms, should I follow suit with the rest of the house? My range hood and kitchen island will be maple wood stained in special walnut. My home is facing north, I’m not sure how much that matters. These two bathrooms will have Aluma Marble laminate. The power room and kitchen will be Calacatta Elysio.

Also, I’ve thought about doing white dove walls in these bathrooms (possibly even the whole house) and doing a darker painted cabinet. I thought about iron ore for my son’s bathroom and powder room. Maybe a mushroom color for my daughter’s bathroom? They’re very small children so I don’t plan on letting them pick haha we’d have bathrooms color drenched in purple and green if I did. 

In the laundry room I plan to have brick floor in Old Orleans by Cherokee brick with either butcher block or Aluma Marble laminate.

The day I got my marriage license with Reed Hawthorne, he told me:

""We'll only have the title of husband and wife, nothing real between us.

""As long as you behave and play the good Mrs. Hawthorne, I can give you anything you want—except me.""

I was obedient. I played the perfect Mrs. Hawthorne for three whole years.

Three years later, his first love, Vivian Cross, suddenly appeared and handed me ten million dollars and told me to leave Reed.

""Reed says you two are just victims of the previous generation's mess. Your marriage has always been in name only.

""He wants to have a real family now, with a child born from someone he actually loves.

""You've already held him back for three years. I hope you can let him go.""

So he had someone he liked now!

It really wasn't right for me to keep occupying the position of Mrs. Hawthorne anymore.

That night, I went to find Reed in his study.

""Back then you said I could have whatever I wanted. Does that still count?""

Reed put down the documents in his hands, his slender fingers removing the glasses from his nose.

His eyes flickered, a smile playing at his lips.

""Of course.

""What do you want?""

My hand holding the documents tightened slightly as I placed the divorce papers in front of him.

""I want you to sign this.""

\---

Everyone said I hit the jackpot when I married Reed Hawthorne—like I'd won the damn lottery becoming Mrs. Hawthorne.

But they had no clue. This marriage? Neither of us wanted it.

It all started when Grandpa got really sick and had to be hospitalized.

Reed's grandfather happened to be in the same place, and by pure chance, Mr. Hawthorne recognized Grandpa as an old war buddy.

The kind who'd saved his life, no less.

The two old guys spent hours reminiscing about the past, catching up on everything.

When they got to talking about me, Grandpa's voice cracked.

He was terrified that after he was gone, my stepmother and her kids would make my life hell.

Mr. Hawthorne couldn't stand seeing his old friend so torn up. Right then and there, he said I should marry his grandson.

So that's how Reed and I met—on day one.

Day two, we found out about this arranged marriage that came out of nowhere.

Day three, we were husband and wife.

Right after we got our marriage license, Reed laid it out for me.

""We'll only have the title of husband and wife, nothing real between us.

""As long as you behave and play the good Mrs. Hawthorne, I can give you anything you want—except me.""

Honestly? I was relieved when he said that.

I mean, some guy I'd known for three days suddenly becoming my husband?

Truth is, I couldn't wrap my head around it either.

So we settled into this weird roommate situation with wedding rings.

At first, I felt pretty awkward about the whole thing.

But Reed? He was actually amazing.

On the daily, I got nannies and housekeepers handling everything.

Money-wise, he used to drop five million into my account every month, and he'd even given me his extra card.

Relationship-wise, he actually acted like the married man he was supposed to be.

I never saw a single tabloid story about him with other women.

Even though hardly anyone knew he was married, and absolutely nobody knew I existed.

As time went on, I started really loving what we had.

I thought we'd go on like this forever.

But I forgot—he never loved me.

So of course he wasn't going to let me be Mrs. Hawthorne forever.

Chapter 2

Last night Reed didn't come home.

I mean, sometimes he'd be gone on business trips and stuff.

But this time felt different.

There it was on the news—Reed gently helping Vivian along, and her looking all shy and smitten as she gazed up at him.

In three years of marriage, this was the first time I'd ever seen any news about him with another woman.

\[Hawthorne Group CEO and Emmy-Winning Actress Vivian Cross Spotted on Late-Night Malibu Beach Walk.\]

The comments section was going crazy.

Most people were saying how perfect they looked together, what a power couple they'd make.

My fingers unconsciously traced over Reed's face in the photo—how relaxed he looked, how genuinely happy.

My chest tightened.

Yeah, they really did look perfect together.

The next morning, I saw Reed.

I had no idea when he'd gotten back.

Not that he needed to tell me anyway.

""Have you been keeping up with the news lately?""

Reed's smooth voice cut through the quiet, and I stopped mid-spoon, looking up at him.

""What news?""

Something flickered in his eyes. He studied me for a long moment before saying casually, ""Nothing important.

""Just some trashy gossip.""

I kept my voice even. ""Okay.""

Then went back to my cereal.

After a beat, he spoke again.

""Probably better that you didn't see it anyway."" His voice was low, and I couldn't tell if he sounded relieved or disappointed.

My heart clenched.

I figured he was probably hoping for a different answer from me.

That way he could've kept the conversation going.

And then dumped me.

I thought if I just kept dodging the truth, maybe I could stay by Reed's side a little longer.

But here's the thing about stuff that was never yours to begin

—no matter how badly you want to hold onto it.

Eventually, you're just fooling yourself.

""Thanks for agreeing to meet with me today.""

Sitting across from me was Hollywood's hottest leading lady, Vivian Cross.

When the housekeeper told me Vivian wanted to see me, my first instinct was to say hell no.

But if it wasn't today, it'd be tomorrow.

I could dodge her once, maybe twice, but how long could that last?

""What did you want to talk about?"" I asked, even though we both knew why she was here.

Vivian picked up her coffee and took a delicate sip, every movement graceful, her smile picture-perfect.

There was no contest between us.

""Reed and I went to college together,"" she said with a soft smile. ""He never told you that, did he?""

My stomach dropped, but I nodded.

""No, he didn't mention it.""

""But Reed's told me all about you."" Her tone shifted slightly. ""You're the wife his grandfather forced him to marry three years ago, right?""

Forced.

So, that's how Reed had explained me to her.

I mean, he wasn't wrong, but it still felt like a punch to the gut.

""Yeah, that's right."" My voice came out flat, emotionless, as I gripped my coffee cup tighter, willing my hands not to shake.

She smiled that calm, confident smile and pulled a check from her purse, sliding it across the table.

""That's ten million. I want you to leave Reed.""

Her smile was so sure, so composed—and it made me want to throw up.

""Did he ask you to come here?"" The words came out like gravel.

Vivian shook her head, her voice flowing like silk.

""Reed told me you two are just casualties of some old family debt, that your marriage has never been real.

""He wants to have a real family now. With someone he actually loves, and kids of his own.

""You've already taken three years from him. I think it's time you let him go.""

Chapter 3

I didn't take Vivian's money.

I'd already been sitting in someone else's rightful place as Mrs. Hawthorne for all these years—taking her money on top of that?

That just felt wrong on every level.

My grandfather passed away a year ago.

Back then, I thought Reed would divorce me right away.

But he didn't.

He was the one who handled all the funeral arrangements after Grandpa died.

My dad and stepmom's family? They were nowhere to be found from start to finish.

Ever since they found out Grandpa needed surgery and it was going to cost a fortune, they just vanished into thin air.

The only reason I agreed to marry Reed in the first place was because his grandfather promised he'd cover my grandpa's medical bills.

During that time, Reed stayed with me for two whole weeks.

When I'd break down crying under the covers in the middle of the night, he'd hold me tight and just wait in silence until I cried myself to sleep before he'd leave.

When I had no appetite for anything, he'd personally go out and buy me those chocolate chip cookies from Levain Bakery that Grandpa used to get for me.

And when I felt completely alone in the world, he brought me a dog so I'd have company again.

I'd already fallen in love with him.

But the person he loved wasn't me.

Someone that wonderful—how could I be selfish enough to stand in the way of his happiness?

That evening, I went to find Reed in his study.

Sitting behind his desk, Reed looked even more untouchable than usual.

I slowly walked over to face him, and after steeling myself, I spoke up.

""Remember when you said I could have anything I wanted? Does that still stand?""

Reed set down the papers he was holding, those long fingers of his removing the glasses from his nose.

His eyes flickered with something, a smile playing at the corners of his mouth.

""Of course.

""What is it you want?""

That look in his eyes—like he'd been waiting for this moment forever.

So he'd been wanting to divorce me all along!

My grip tightened on the papers in my hand, then I placed the divorce agreement in front of him.

""I want you to sign this.""

As the document hit the desk, it felt like someone had grabbed my heart in a vice grip—the pain was so sharp I could barely breathe.

My eyes burned hot, and before the tears could completely betray me, I rushed to finish what I had to say.

""I already signed it.

""Once you sign, we can go file for divorce tomorrow.""

With that, I spun around and bolted from the study.

The tears started falling like rain the second I turned away.

Back in my room, I buried myself under the covers and sobbed.

This was only the second time in my life I'd cried this hard.

Turns out love really does hurt.

It hurt until my eyes were swollen, until my whole body ached, like it wasn't even mine anymore.

I didn't sleep a wink, and by morning my eyes were puffy and red.

Looking at my wrecked reflection in the mirror, I sniffled and told myself I absolutely could not let Reed see that I'd been crying.

After several layers of concealer, once I was sure my face showed no trace of tears.

Finally, I dragged myself out of the room.

1ledm9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ledm9s/the_honeymoon_phase_is_over_anxiety_is_returning/,The 'Honeymoon' Phase Is Over & Anxiety Is Returning. Was the initial calm even real?,"Hey guys, looking for some wisdom here as I'm feeling a bit lost.

**Background:** I'm 35, been drinking 2-3 strong instant coffees every day since I was about 19. I've had a constant, low-level anxiety for as long as I can remember.

**The Quit:** I had my last coffee on May 31st. For the first \~2 weeks, I switched to just decaf and the occasional green tea just dipping the teabag in and out, and used this when my headaches got bad. The change was profound. My anxiety disappeared completely. I felt a sense of calm I haven't felt in my adult life. I was so excited that I'd found the ""cure.""

**The Problem:** About a week ago, I cut out the green tea as well to go truly caffeine-free. Ever since then, my anxiety has started to creep back in. It's not as bad as it was when I was drinking coffee, but it's there, and I'm feeling really disheartened and confused.

It's making me question that first amazing week. Was it real calm, or was it just some kind of emotional numbness from the initial shock of quitting?

(For full context, I also recently restarted Wegovy after a few weeks off, and have been feeling the usual fatigue/headaches from that, which probably isn't helping).

Has anyone been through a similar rollercoaster? Where you feel amazing at first, only for the anxiety to return for a while? How long did it take for you to finally level out?
