Hi everyone,

I’m based in Scotland and currently working as an Assistant Manager at a large coffee chain, three months into a six-month probation period.

Recently, another staff member expressed interest in becoming a manager at the same chain. Today, I received an unexpected email requesting both myself and this staff member to submit an application for the role to be forwarded to our area manager.

I’ve drafted an email to the area manager asking why I’m required to apply for the role when I am already performing in that position. The reason it hasn’t been sent yet is because when I asked my current assistant manager, he initially gave me his personal email address instead of the area managers, when pressed for the correct email he then told me to wait until I returns from my time off. 

Although I understand that I don’t have full employment rights yet due to not being employed for over two years, I’m concerned about the possibility of being pushed out in favor of a long-standing employee for the role I’m already performing.

Where do I stand in this position? Should I start looking for a new job?

Thanks in advance for any advice or guidance.

Not sure how to start this but I, 21 female, have gotten into multiple issues with my bf, 25 male, his mom, and dad on “priorities”. I’ll start from the beginning. To add a bit more context, me and my bf have been together for 6 1/2 years. 

My bfs dad’s birthday is in December, which also is my best friend’s birthday month. Back in August, me and my best friend, let’s call her Emily, made plans for me to drive her out of state to go see her long distance bf. She had already paid me for gas and my food expenses since I was helping her out. She can drive on her own BUT she has been in multiple freak accidents and prefers not to drive long distances. Now mind you we have had this plan not for months. My bfs dad’s birthday was the Wednesday after the weekend I would be driving Emily out of state. I would never make plans on his actual birthday and no one told me we had plans for anything yet. 

The Monday before the weekend me and Emily had planned, his mom calls and tells us; “we will be celebrating your dad’s birthday this weekend.” I politely let them know that I will be running late because of previous plans. My boyfriend would be going down Friday night, and I was going to come down around Saturday afternoon and stay till Sunday. In total, I would be driving around eight hours to Emily’s bfs and back. Once I would drop Emily off back at home I had another hour drive to get to my boyfriend’s parents house. This was not enough for them. They said I am not prioritizing them and putting my friends above them. My boyfriend also agrees with them and tells me that I should drop everything for family.

Don’t get me wrong if this was just a coffee date or a dinner with a friend, without a doubt I would have rescheduled. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case and these were already very important plans for my friend. I offered up the weekend after his birthday and I’d be able to spend the whole weekend with them. They did not want that. I am now in the doghouse, and do not think I did anything quite wrong. Maybe I was just raised differently, but I do keep my word, and I think that is very important. But with being in the doghouse, it’s making me reconsider and think maybe I am in the wrong. There has been multiple other issues, but for now I will just stick to this one.

Can someone tell me the rules of fasting?

If you have a non alc drink is that considered a cheat (i.e. coffee)? I also hear that in the church, the day is considered over when the sun sets (I have not fact checked this), therefore can I eat when it gets dark outside? If you have to eat every so often to not feel ill, how does that effect it? If someone has suffered from an ED in the past, how would this play into fasting?

1jgnack,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jgnack/day_five/,Day Five.,"I have no real drive to quit vaping. I dont have breathing issues. I sleep just fine.  No health concerns whatsoever. I just don't like paying for it anymore. It's become stupid expensive. It feels stupid to keep paying for it.

I used to smoke ciggies.. I hated the smell of ciggies. It's fine when im smoking it.. but i hate the smell of other people smoking it. I hate the way it clings to my clothes. I hate how it sticks to my fingers.. but i loved the way it forces me to breathe deeply and slowly. Then one day i discovered juul.. Simultaneously, the need for the deep breathing exercises eased up as well. I never went back. I was an easy convert.

I won't say that i vape heavily. I can go for hours.. even half a day-a full 12hrs without a drag if i have to. No problems. Not cranky.. not emo. But i seem to struggle with being completely without it. I like having it. Unlike most people, they associate smoking with the urgent dopamine fix for whenever the circumstances aren't ideal. However, I am not like that. If anything, i think i use it as an amplifier for when the times are good. I may have used it as a reward for myself as well.. A great view after a long hike. A warm cup of coffee when everyone and everything is still asleep. Cold summer night drives with the windows down. A break from people. I just solved a problem. I built this ikea thing. Coming home to where all my favorite things are. 

It's not like I don't enjoy these things anymore cause I don't have it.. it's more like there's something missing from the experience. An urgent gratification for the everyday struggles of a pedestrian life.

Hopefully this helps for anyone debating between Lelit Mara X (a unique HX that operates like a dual boiler due to dual PID engineering). vs a dual boiler which is known to be more ideal for precise temp controls but  may be overkill for a few drinks a day. 

*Steam Mode:* It actually was oddly colder (~190-192F) on steam mode and brewed a few degrees higher, close to the 197 target setting. Steaming milk did not impact brew temperature in any meaningful way. 

*Brew Mode:* Temps around 194 and brewing a few degrees higher around 199-200. Weirdly slightly higher temps than steam mode without as strong of steam power


*Conclusion*: Lelit Mara X is a very temp stable machine, and you get all the benefits that come with E61 (pre-infusion, robust build quality and aesthetics). 

All this fuss about steam mode “burning your coffee” at least on my machine is not the case.  It’s actually the opposite, somehow the brew appears to be colder.  *And back to back workflow no impact on temps surprisingly.* 


I’m just going to keep my machine on steam mode going forward.

1jgn5df,https://www.reddit.com/r/sirenhead/comments/1jgn5df/something_was_in_the_forest_story_by_me/,Something was in the forest. Story by me.,"I heard a sound in the forest, a cry from an animal. It sounded off, like something had compromised its vocal cords, tightening them to make it choppy. I assumed a cougar or other predator had made a kill. I sat in my watchtower, looking around, doing my job of watching for fires. I liked my job, it was remote and cozy, plus I get to do whatever as long as I am alert and aware of the forest.  
  
My watchtower is about 100 feet above ground, so I can see a large portion of the surrounding forest. I was in watchtower 5, to the right was watchtower 6, probably 4 miles away. It was a slow day, so I sat back and played a game on my computer. I looked around and saw some smoke coming from the trees. I paused my game and went over to the radio to check if there was a camper set in the surrounding area.  
  
The operator said there was, and that they would be staying two nights, I confirmed they had arrived. I went back to my game and played for about another hour. After I got off, I took a look around, making sure to take certain observations, like if there were fires and where they were.  
  
It was starting to get dark, so I decided to call radio control and say I am turning in for the night. I got no response, so I decided to wait a few minutes before calling again, in case they were switching operators. I called back, no response. I took a step outside and looked at the radio relay, it wasn’t there. I was confused as there was no loud thud of it falling. 

I called watchtower 6, the connection is direct, so he picked up. “Watchtower 6.” He said. “Hey, it's watchtower 5, I’m pretty sure the radio relay is down, so I don't have any connection to radio control,” I replied. “I still have a connection but it is very choppy, I’ll try to contact radio about it, anything you want me to tell them?” “Yes, I’m turning in for the night.” “Copy that, watchtower 6 out.”

I layed in my bed, thinking about how the radio tower could have been knocked down without us hearing a sound. I pondered that thought until I fell asleep. I didn’t have much sleep as I woke up in the middle of the night. I don’t know what caused me to wake up, but I had an eerie feeling. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling until drowsiness could take me out.

I was falling back asleep when I heard a somewhat loud bark, echoing through the forest and off the hills. That woke me up the rest of the way, and I decided to do a quick check for anything out of the ordinary. I looked around, the darkness was almost suffocating and I could barely see anything because the clouds were blocking out the moon.

The air was filled with a cold, bitter tone. I felt as if I were being watched, I know it sounds strange and silly, but the feeling was there and undeniable. I couldn’t shake the feeling, and I knew I would struggle to fall back asleep, but I tried to do so anyway. The morning came quickly, and I sat up in bed, smelling the fresh air. I looked around at the nearby campsites, their fires were lit, so I knew they were awake.

I had assumed radio control knew I would be awake by now, and would think I'm on duty, so I did my morning routine of checking all of my equipment. Everything worked, so I went to the shed by the base of my tower to grab some firewood. A camper came up to me, said he wanted to buy firewood. The camp hosts allow firewood selling, so I gave him 2 bundles for $10. I went back into my tower and put my own firewood in the stove and filed the statement of firewood being sold.

Later that day, they got the radio relay replaced and rewired. They even reinforced it, so once they were gone I checked in with radio control. Radio said they had a report of a predator in my sector. I acknowledged this and went to let everybody in the immediate sector know about the situation. I went to the watchtower speakers and said “Everybody in the immediate area of watchtower 5, there is a predator, do not be alarmed, it will not attack unless threatened. Be alert.”

The message echoed off of the hills. I repeated the message, for clarity. Because of the alert, I was required to keep watch, so I took my binoculars and looked around. I saw a tornado siren in the distance, it was old and the pole it was on looked to either be wooden or rusted.

There was a clearing southwest of my tower, and in it I saw an animal corpse. I knew that must be why there was a warning. I got my binoculars and looked at it closer, that is when I realized it was a human body. I immediately got to my radio and called in a report.

“Radio Control, this is watchtower 5, I have seen a human body in the clearing southwest of my tower” I said shakingly. “Copy that, we are going to send rangers, a coroner, and the police. We need you to tell everybody to evacuate the area and they will get a different campsite assignment if they choose to stay.” “Roger.”

I went to the speaker and announced that they need to pack up immediately and go back to the main camping office. I saw some plumes of smoke and steam coming up as they extinguished their fires. I went back outside and continued looking around for anything out of the ordinary that could do harm to campers. I heard a scream in the distance, coming from a campsite south of my tower. I grabbed my flashlight and radio and went down the stairs and ran to the campsite. I approached it quickly and my heart dropped.

The fire was extinguished, but there was blood everywhere. There was the lower half of a human body, the upper half was nowhere to be seen. I unholstered my gun and radioed in the second body and the campsite. Minutes later, police came, they took my statement of what happened.

When I returned to the tower, it was night time, this was the first time anything like that had happened. I called in and told control I was turning in for the night. I lay down in bed and was practically paralyzed with the fear of whatever killed them coming for me next.

I tried falling asleep, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I eventually gave up on sleep and brewed a pot of coffee. I kept nervously looking at my surroundings, thinking someone or something was going to jump out at me. When my coffee was done I got to drinking and looking around.  
  
The sky was clear, so the moonlight of the full moon illuminated everything. I looked back towards the old tornado siren, it was gone. I was struck with confusion, it couldn’t have moved or been toppled over. Then I heard it, a child’s voice calling out for help, loudly echoing throughout the forest. I exited the watchtower and tried to hear if they would call again. They never called back, so I called out for them and told them to come to my watchtower if they needed help.  
  
I flipped on my watchtower lights to use as a beacon. I was looking around the forest, when I turned the corner, something ducked out of my light. It was as tall as the trees and looked like it had not eaten. I retreated and turned off my lights. I went into my watchtower cabin and listened for it to retreat.  
  
I heard a loud radio announcement, the same one I had made about the predator in the area. I was shocked to my core. I contacted watchtower 6 and told him to look out his window at my tower.  
  
He told me what he saw: “I… I don't know how to describe it.” He said, shakingly. “It has sirens for its head, but it's… it’s looking at me. I have to go.” I heard the creature walk off, its footsteps sending thuds. I grabbed my camera and snapped a photo, I brought it back inside and let it develop. I realised the creature was heading for watchtower 6.  
  
In the morning there was no contact from watchtower 6, so control sent me to investigate. It took two hours to walk there, my atv was in the shop. When I got there, I froze, there was blood covering the ground. He was nowhere to be seen, I assumed the worst. I went up to the watchtower cabin. There was a broken window, I could tell it was broken from the outside. He was nowhere to be seen. I called control and informed them of the tower’s condition. I went back to my watchtower but I knew I couldn’t leave.  
  
I had to get to the bottom of this. I looked at the photo I had taken. It was true, a grotesque monster, with two sirens for a head, but the sirens were mouths. I contemplated everything, my stomach turned. I realised I had not eaten. I took a microwave burrito out of my freezer and threw it into the microwave.  
  
Everything hit me at once, I cried. I didn’t know what that was or what it wanted. I only knew it would come after me next, and I was defenseless. All I had was a small handgun, it wouldn’t do anything to the behemoth. I ate my burrito in solemn silence.  
  
I was visited by police asking for my input, I told them about the monster and showed them the picture I took of it. At first, they didn’t believe me, but then they realised another forest in the county has been having similar occurrences. They took notes of everything and put some heavily armed officers around the watchtowers.  
  
The officers made me feel more safe, but I still had the fear it wouldn’t be enough. When night came, I heard a tornado siren in the distance. It was distorted and creepy, like the one in Chicago that malfunctioned. There were booming footsteps coming towards my watchtowers.  
  
The officers took aim towards the direction. Then he showed up, the towering monstrosity. I turned on the lights to get a better picture. His limbs were covered in a pale brown skin, he was thin and lengthy, his head had no eyes, we had no clue how he knew we were here. The officers were shaking in fear. I guess one of them had the nerve to fire first, and with a burst of 12 gauge from a mossberg, a loud bang rang out. Sirens emerged, a mix of an EAS alarm and tornado siren, ringing out as the creature went ballistic.  
  
The other officers started spraying at it, blindly firing, the creature let out screams, but it felt empty. I don't think it could feel the pain. I unholstered my sidearm and took aim at its siren, with an estimate of where the bullet may land, I pulled the trigger.  
  
That thing screamed, its weakness was its sirens. I kept firing, but it got on all fours and ran off into the distance.

1jgn4rw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jgn4rw,What smell/perfume do you think the LI's like best on your MC?,"Stop right there, this is a sniff checkpoint!

I wanna know what everyone thinks their MC smells like? What perfume would she wear? Do you think it reflects her personality?

I think my MC smells sweet and spicy. Like vanilla, white pepper, and cinammon, with notes of sea salt and cardamom. A little Gourmand, but not overly so.

But most importantly, what scents do you think the LI's really like? They're always sniffing in the crook of our necks 💀 

My hc for them would be:

Xavier: Fruity and floral, something like orange blossom, citrus, berries, bergamot, patchouli, with subtle notes of oud. He likes what reminds him of spring, a picnic in a field, or flowers in freshly washed hair.

Zayne: His preferences are a bit on the simpler side. He probably doesn't like complex scents as they offend his nose. Pear and Jasmine with a clean powdery base. He might like eating sweets and pastries, but I can't see him enjoying an offensively sugary scent. He will, however, go feral for a decadent musky/amber vanilla tonka bean scent.

Rafayel: He'd lick the sea salt off her neck if he could (he can). Wood sage, ash, pepper, water lily, ginger flower, and another vanilla enjoyer. Think burnt caramel pretzels, saffron, hot ginger tea, figs over toast and caviar.

Sylus: Ah this man. For the most part, he likes what he likes. As in, he likes to smell *him* on her. Tobacco, iron, musk amber, warm sandalwood, with notes of plum and smokey cherry. Hot red wine, cocoa, kerosene and rain. 

Caleb: It goes without saying this man likes the smell of home. Leather/suede, warm apple brandy, cedarwood, and cardamom. Layered with vanilla and oud. He likes what smells lived in. A bit of dust dancing in evening sunlight, fresh bread baked in the morning, hints of coffee on warm skin.

Bonus round: What do you think that one Lemurian pheromone perfume that made Rafayel go crazy in 'Your Fragrance' smells like? Asking for a friend.",0,1742579968.0,LoveAndDeepspace,1,0.5,False

I have developed a protocol to keep me as safe as I can. Worked well in Rio. 

We stayed in Copa.

1- Rio is Awesome! So alive and vibrant. People seemed to be having fun and enjoying life. Infectious really. Everyone should be having fun. 

2 - Safety - never felt unsafe once. 

3- People are nice. Even though I speak no Portuguese. Except to say water and thank you.  

4- Google translate came in handy allot.

5- My iPhone, I carried it with me and used it to take pics and used it generally only when we were sitting at a beach bar or cafe. Something I tend to do anywhere I travel. I did step into a store or two as well. 

6 - You hear about the beach culture in Brazil. Wow they love the beach. Me too LOL. I would get a fruit smoothie and coffee each morning and people are already going to the beach, I imagine to get a good spot.

7 - There are some fit people in Rio. I know not everyone but wow! 

8 - I though the food was good. The fruit smoothies! Yummy. 

9 - The caipirinha! Tasty but those will sneak up on you! I am a bourbon guy and can handle a a couple good old fashioneds or manhattans.  Damn if the caipirinha didn't kick my ass the first night. 3-5 bucks each! The most we paid was 5 but it was really big. 

10 - the Sun and humidity. Coming from the Pacific NW. It was a welcome change. Though I did take 3-4 showers a day LOL. But it is intense so sunscreen up.

I plan to 100% go back. We could only fit in a week. Though I think I was just getting in to my groove and we had to leave. 

We ARE not sex tourists. We both have girlfriends we love very much. Why didn't our girlfriends go? We both wanted them to go. 

They both have some other things planned plus they didn't want to travel that far for only 6 nights. I have to agree. Next time at least two weeks. 

Sorry for the long winded review. But if anyone is on the fence about Brazil, just go.

I have not met BM. I had a good relationship with SD prior to me becoming pregnant, now almost everything that comes out of her mouth is clearly straight from the mouth of her BM. 

I will be moving in with my DH soon and I am wondering how yall would move forward. BM and I have several mutual friends, small town, but have never met. I’m wondering if I should send her a message to see if she wants to meet for coffee in hopes to have a cordial relationship? 

She hasn’t said anything bad directly to DH or mutual friends but SD is clearly being a parrot relaying things like- “it’s just so shocking” and “it’s way too soon to move in together “ even though BM was pregnant in the first month of the relationship. 

It doesn’t bother me too much but I also know that things could take a turn for the worse. For example, I told SD I would take her birthday shopping for DH and then SD shows up with a huge gift for DH from BM with a hoodie that says “just do nothing “ 👀👀  ??

I told SD let’s go shopping and she said” No! I’ve done enough shopping for him” - 

Also I asked her to get her nails done etc.. and she used to be excited and now she says she won’t. so clearly that’s also from BM / I can only assume BM is feeling some type of way about me being pregnant but is only expressing this through SD. 

DH has asked SD about her behavior and she claims everything is just fine and she really likes me. Which I know she does but is torn between being loyal to BM

Should I reach out to BM? And ask her to coffee? She told DH that yes we should all get together at some point but I just want to help my relationship with SD by getting coffee ☕️

I woke up today with the worst fatigue I’ve had in a while and just crazy feelings of being like something is wrong - what is wrong with me?! - and wanting to quit life for a day, shakiness, skin crawling, leg heaviness, etc. I have flex in my job that i could take the morning to rest at home but had to come into work for the rest of the day. But for real - it’s a full-on, day-long panic attack. 

I’m here and, well… Cannot. Calm. Down. It’s nuts. I’ve never had one this bad coinciding with my PMDD symptoms. Trying to isolate what the heck has caused it to be so extreme…
-could I be in premonopause (36yo)
-is it sleep?
-is it because I switched to mushroom coffee recently and ran out yesterday/drank coffee for the first time in 2ish weeks (😂)
-is it lack of sleep?
-is it an MS flare up?

This will be long, and I ask your forgiveness in advance.

Necessary explanation on how this all began: In 1999 I was a college student majoring in English, in the Professional Writing track. Like an idiot, one year I signed up for three English classes in one semester. There was a week that I had 3 papers due, 5-10 pages each, and a case of major writer's block. In desperation, I went to the local bookstore to hopefully find a book on how to get past said writer's block.

The store was a B&N, so there was a good sized section for books about writing. In my browsing, I saw a small, black paperback book titled ""Automatic Writing"". To me, that sounded like it could be what I needed. So I read the intro and it was all about channeling spirits through writing, how to do it, etc. I put it back on the shelf and thought ""sounds interesting, but that's not what I'm looking for"".

Fast forward to about a year later. I'm chilling out, watching some movie, and for some reason start thinking about that little black paperback and what the intro said. Eventually (of course) I decide to try it out. 

Before I continue, I realize that the most discussed method of channeling in this way is to relax, meditate for a moment, ask for protection, and just let yourself write from that space. This has *not* been my experience, and I have never been able to find anyone who shares it. 

When I sat down for the very first time to try automatic writing, when I put the pen to the paper, it immediately took off. Like took off on it's own. Literally all my hand was doing was holding the pen in place. The best way I can describe it is, imagine there's a magnet on the underside of the page, and it's locked on to the pen, moving it along and merely needing me to just hold it upright.

The first thing it wrote was ""sheshereshesheresheshere..."" over and over again. I looked at it and thought ""Sheshere? What the hell is a sheshere?"" Then it occurred to me that it was ""she's here she's here she's here"". This was 25 years ago, and it still blows my mind. I took it as meaning that the spirit world was excited that I finally figured out that I could communicate with them. I do not lift the pen at all when it writes, it is one continuous line. So there is lack of punctuation, crossing t's, and dotting i's which means sometimes it can take a minute for me to really look at it and see what's being said. 

So this continued to be something I just randomly did over the next several years, up to 2017 and sporadically since then. I haven't quit doing it, I just don't feel the need to as much as I once did.

In 2013, I very nearly died from long-term Crohn's disease, with an obstructed intestine, and massive internal infections from a fistula gone wild, and a botched surgery to try fixing it all. Apologies for the gross factor here, but after switching surgeons to one more qualified for advanced bowel disease, I had four drain bags inserted in various parts of my abdomen to suction and catch the infection and fluid build up. I was in the hospital for 3 months altogether fighting this.

At one point, the doctor thought it might do me good mentally to go home and have home nurse visits twice a day. He could see how so much time in the hospital was affecting me, and thought being at home would also help me to heal. Of course I was on board with this, and went home, even though I was a bit scared because of the extremely bad shape I was in.

One of the things my doctor asked me to do at home was, when I emptied my drain bags, to do so into a measured cup he gave me, and write down the amount of output. So I kept a notebook and a pen on the coffee table at all times. 

I also had an awful UTI, and the incision from the botched surgery also was infected, and had opened back up, so I had a bag over that as well. To get up from a laying down position was extremely painful because it requires so much of your abdominal muscles. So what I did was pile up a few big blankets on the couch, and just kind of leaned on them and did my best to try getting some sleep (hard enough even if I could lay down).

One night, I emptied my bags, wrote down the output, sat back and closed my eyes. When I closed my eyes, I pictured in my head what I had just done: written something down. The instant I did this, I was very suddenly and aggressively grabbed by my left forearm (I'm a lefty) and pulled out of my body. Literally one second to the next I went from a quiet living room with only the glow of the TV, to having a spirit grabbing me. I felt the grip, like there was an actual hand.

I immediately started talking to the spirit, all by thought, because that's how I had always done the channeling. I've never spoken a word out loud to spirit. I would always reply with thought, and even if I interrupted, the pen would stop immediately, and go back to the far left of the page to reply to my thought. 

So with this spirit it was the same, by thought only. It went something like this, ""WHOA, hold on a minute, wait wait wait...I appreciate that you want to help me. Thank you for wanting to get me out of this body and out of this pain, but this is way too overwhelming right now...there's so much I'm dealing with, I can't do this right now, please let me back down, I love you, but I'm not prepared for this, please"" and gradually I sank back down fully in my body once again. I immediately sat up, lit a cigarette, and sat there mind-blown and shocked. 

My best theory is that years of channeling opened up some kind of entrance for spirit via my left arm, which is what they use to write with me. I had a friend once tell me ""Be careful with that, you don't want to invite anything dark to come in. You need to close that door when you're not writing with them"". I have since done this, and have also fully recovered physically from that horrific time.

Apologies for the novel, and thank you if you've read this far. I am open to any questions anyone may have. Love and light to everyone.",4,1742579082.0,Experiencers,2,1.0,False

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you dreaming of a living space that stands out? Red barndominium designs may be the answer. With their unconventional style and practical benefits, these unique homes are capturing the attention of many. Imagine a bright red exterior paired with rustic interiors, creating a perfect balance of charm and modernity. Let’s dig deeper into what makes this design so captivating.

### What is a Barndominium?

A barndominium is a blend of a barn and condominium, providing a spacious and functional living environment. They often come with high ceilings, open floor plans, and a variety of design options. A red barndominium, in particular, offers a striking visual appeal that brings warmth and character to any landscape.

### Why Choose a Red Barndominium?

The choice of red isn’t just about aesthetic. Here are a few reasons why this design is appealing:

- **Bold Statement:** The vibrant red color attracts attention and makes a memorable statement. It stands out against green pastures, blue skies, or snowy landscapes.
- **Versatile Style:** A red barndominium can fit in with rural settings or provide a striking contrast in urban areas, making it suitable for various locations.
- **Rustic Charm:** The design often incorporates wood, metal, and other materials that embody a rustic flair, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Many barndominiums are built using sustainable materials, which can reduce energy costs and environmental impact.

### Design Elements to Consider

When planning your red barndominium, consider these essential design elements:

- **Open Floor Plans:** The interior should feel spacious. High ceilings and an open layout can make the living area feel larger and less constricted.
- **Large Windows:** Installing oversized windows allows natural light to flood the space, making it bright and airy. Plus, they offer stunning views of the outside landscape.
- **Outdoor Spaces:** A deck or porch can extend your living area outdoors. It’s an excellent way to enjoy nature while being comfortable.
- **Custom Touches:** Personalize your barndominium with unique features such as barn doors, tongue-and-groove ceilings, or a modern kitchen layout.

### Interior Design Inspirations

The inside of your red barndominium can be as stunning as the outside. Here are some design inspirations you might consider:

- **Rustic Meets Modern:** Combine wooden beams with sleek finishes to achieve a balanced look.
- **Farmhouse Aesthetic:** Use vintage furniture, soft colors, and natural materials to enhance the home’s cozy vibe.
- **Industrial Style:** Incorporate metal accents and minimalist decor for a fresh, contemporary feel.
- **Nature-inspired:** Bring the outdoors in with houseplants, nature colors, and organic textures.

### Bringing Your Vision to Life

Once you've decided on the color and style, you might wonder how to bring your red barndominium vision to life. Here are key steps to consider:

- **Plan Carefully:** Work with an architect or builder to create a detailed plan that meets your needs and adheres to local codes.
- **Budget Wisely:** Establish a budget that covers construction, design, and any possible upgrades. Stick to it to avoid overspending.
- **Select Quality Materials:** Invest in durable materials that ensure longevity. Quality often makes a big difference in design and maintenance.
- **Involve Professionals:** Collaborate with interior designers or contractors who specialize in barndominiums. Their expertise can guide you towards achieving the desired look.

The Benefits of Choosing a Barndominium: Combining Style and Functionality in Home Design
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In recent years, the popularity of barndominiums has skyrocketed, not just for their eye-catching designs but also for the practical benefits they offer to homeowners. If you’re searching for a unique living space, a barndominium might be the perfect choice. These homes elegantly blend rustic charm with modern comforts, allowing you to create a space that is both stylish and highly functional.

One of the biggest benefits of choosing a barndominium is the open floor plan. Unlike traditional homes that often feature segmented spaces, barndominiums allow for vast, open areas that foster natural light and a feeling of spaciousness. The absence of interior walls offers versatility in design, meaning you can create your dream layout tailored to your lifestyle. Whether you prefer a modern loft aesthetic or a cozy family gathering area, the flexibility of a barndominium can meet your needs.

Another advantage lies in the cost efficiency of building a barndominium. Typically, the materials and construction methods used for barndominiums are more economical than conventional homes. Steel and metal components can often be sourced for less, and the quicker assembly leads to savings on labor costs. Homeowners can find themselves spending less while gaining more square footage, allowing for greater investment in interior amenities.

The durability of barndominiums is also a significant consideration. Built primarily with steel and metal siding, these structures are equipped to withstand severe weather conditions, including heavy winds and snow. This durability translates into lower maintenance costs over time, making it an ideal option for families living in challenging environments. With proper insulation, barndominiums are energy-efficient, ensuring you stay comfortable year-round.

- **Energy Efficiency:** Many barndominiums are designed with energy-efficient features such as high-quality insulation, solar panels, and energy-efficient windows, reducing utility bills and environmental impact.
- **Customization:** From choosing floor plans to selecting finishes, barndominiums offer extensive customization options, allowing homeowners to express their style and personality.
- **Multi-Purpose Spaces:** The open layouts can easily accommodate various functions, whether you're looking to create an office, gym, or artist workspace.

Choosing a barndominium means creating a space that meets your specific needs. For instance, you might envision a giant workshop attached to your living area, perfect for hobbies or small business ventures. The large square footage supports various configurations, whether you’re looking to house animals or gather friends for barbeques. This multifunctionality can be especially beneficial for those who work from home or enjoy DIY projects.

Barndominiums also stand out for their aesthetic appeal. Their unique design, often a mix of modern and rustic elements, attracts attention and admiration. You can combine fresh, contemporary finishes with traditional barn-like features, giving your home a distinctive look that rivals any cookie-cutter house. The use of reclaimed wood, metal, and expansive windows adds character while creating an inviting atmosphere.

Moreover, barndominiums cater to sustainable living. Many homeowners are now opting for environmentally friendly building practices, and barndominiums naturally lend themselves to this preference. By using recycled materials and systems such as rainwater harvesting, you can reduce your carbon footprint and promote an eco-friendly lifestyle.

In addition to being visually striking, barndominiums can offer an array of outdoor living spaces. You can design expansive porches or decks that allow you to appreciate nature while sipping your morning coffee or hosting family gatherings. The integration of large outdoor spaces adds to the overall appeal of barndominium living.

Making the decision to invest in a barndominium is a step towards achieving a unique and efficient home that fits your lifestyle. With their blend of modern design, economical construction, and flexibility, barndominiums provide a compelling option for homeowners looking to create something truly personalized and distinctive.

### Conclusion

Red barndominium designs stand out as an exciting trend in home construction that perfectly marries aesthetic appeal with practical functionality. The bold colors and unique architectural details introduce a fresh perspective to living spaces, inviting homeowners to express their individuality. Whether you're drawn to the rustic charm or the modern innovation of barndominiums, these structures offer a distinct style that resonates with many.

Choosing a barndominium goes beyond just its unique appearance. The benefits are numerous: they are often more cost-effective than traditional homes, environmentally friendly, and easy to maintain. The open-concept layout typical of these designs allows for versatile living spaces, making them ideal for families or those who love to entertain. Furthermore, barndominiums can be customized to feature energy-efficient installations, ensuring that you not only save on costs but also contribute positively to the environment.

Investing in a red barndominium means investing in a lifestyle. You gain the ability to weave your personal style into every aspect of your home, from expansive interiors to the choice of materials and colors. For those looking for a bold, beautiful, and unique living space, red barndominiums present an exciting opportunity to create a home that is both visually striking and highly functional.

I was sitting at a small coffee shop in the city, typing away on my laptop, when I couldn't help but overhear a conversation between a young professional and her mentor. The mentor, a middle-aged woman with a stern expression, was lecturing the young professional on the importance of ""networking"" and ""building relationships.""

The young professional, who looked like she was in her early twenties, was nodding enthusiastically and taking notes, but it was clear she was struggling to keep up with the mentor's jargon-filled advice.

At one point, the mentor said, ""You need to think about your personal brand and how you're presenting yourself to the world."" The young professional replied, ""I'm not sure what you mean by personal brand."" The mentor sighed and said, ""Never mind, it's not important.""

The rest of the conversation was equally painful, with the mentor using buzzwords like ""synergy"" and ""disruption"" without explaining what they meant. The young professional looked more and more confused as the meeting went on.

As I listened to their conversation, I couldn't help but think about how much I hated networking events and small talk. It seemed like the mentor was more interested in sounding impressive than actually helping the young professional.

After about 20 minutes, the meeting finally came to a close, and the young professional looked relieved to be escaping. As she packed up her things, I caught her eye and smiled sympathetically. She smiled back and mouthed, ""Help me.""",3,1742578584.0,stories,1,0.71,False

I am a backpacker here in AZ, I have taken the trail the brothers are going on (as well as hundreds of others out here in the Sonoran Desert).

Some background before we get started; I know when they filmed this, it was when they came to Phoenix for their liveshows in October 2024. 

I want to make something very clear for those inexperienced with hiking out here, I feel it is my duty. This is an ""acceptable"" time of year to go hiking mid day out here. **Do not attempt to do this so late in the day any other time of year aside from late fall/winter.** It gets VERY HOT out here, and going hiking on even the easiest of trails can get you heat exhaustion/heat stroke.

Secondly, should you wish to come hiking out here (and please do, it really is beautiful) **make sure you are drinking PLENTY of water.** We do not have any humidity out here, so once you sweat out your water, its gone from your body forever, even in the winter months. Drinking water is so so important out here, and even more important than that is drinking something with electrolytes in it to replace the salt that leaves your system as you sweat.

Sorry to be a dad, but we get a lot of dipshits out here who get themselves sick or killed. Anyway, enough of the lecture. Let's start the video. 

\-**""We did not discuss between the 3 of us what we were bringing with us""** oh jesus h christ these brothers are going to stress me out in this video arent they. Oh my god please laugh at the bit and never ever do this in real life please.

\-Justin wearing jeans on a hike in October. Fucking idiot. lmao.

**-""Instant coffee and coffee cup if I need it.""** Travis genuinely how long do you think you're going to be out here?? It's a two hour hike??? Also i'm imagining the weight of the fuckass coffee packet and cup and cringing oh lord my over-prepared brothers. less is more. 

\-You can never have too much paracord. I feel seen by Travis. You'll probably never ever use it but I always carry a bracelet of about 4 ft of paracord with me at all times because you legit never know. Maybe you'll need to tie something down. Maybe you'll need to make a clothes line. Maybe you'll need to make a shelter. you don't know.

\-Griffin's hiking poles are cracking me up. I doubt this man has ever practiced hiking with poles before. If you never have it's the surest way to make your hike 1 million times more difficult for yourself. I can't wait to watch our Baby Brother trip.

\-Not sure whether the flute bit pisses me off or if I think it's funny. We'll see if he uses it in public on the trail. If he does then it'll piss me the fuck off.

\-Why the FUCK did Justin pack freeze-dried meals??? FOR A 2 HOUR HIKE???? I- These city-slicker yuppie fucks are pissing me off what the fuck are you DOING. And those freeze dried meals are SO expensive. Ugh this actually made me mad bro.

\-Hatchet is actually a really good book and I read it during elementary school and it became a formidable core memory to me and shaped how I view having to live outdoors/survival skis. Definitely give it a read.

\-Griffin giving his second pole to Justin was very smart because if he didn't he was going to trip over himself like a newborn foal.

\-Oh my god this group would have been a fucking nightmare to hike near lmao.

\-SPF Shirts that are long-sleeve are your very best friend out here. Even in the summer, you want to make sure you're preventing as much sun as possible from touching you. You'll feel cooler and you also won't get skin cancer. Good work, Travis.

**-""This is my first time seeing a little cactus.""** Are... Are you fucking kidding??? Justin please say psych right now this is giving me immense emotional damage. Hey... non-desert jerkers... you've seen cacti right? like small ones??? Please??? Also the cactus Justin saw was a barrel cactus, more specifically a California Barrel Cactus, known for their red spines and in the spring gorgeous red and yellow flowers!

\-Justin for the love of god to not touch Cacti. Even if the spines are big enough you might break one and allow the lack of protection to become bird food. But knowing you you'll probably get yourself pricked and then the prick will get infected because the desert dust is a massive microbiome.

# ALSO AND HOLY SHIT I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!!!! STAY ON PREMADE TRAILS AND DO NOT STEP OFF THEM UNLESS NECESSARY!!! 

The Desert dust is covered in a layer of topsil called the ""crust"" or the cryptobiological crust topsoil. **It is literally alive, much like a coral reef.** It is the very reason the Sonora looks the way it does, like hard soil, rather than sandwastes/sand dunes. [Stepping on it will literally kill it.](https://www.nps.gov/articles/soil-crusts-of-sonoran-chihuahuan-deserts.htm) **It takes centuries to grow,** and we need the crust to prevent the sand and dust from becoming a horrific dust storm in times of heavy winds. **Please, please, please don't bust our crust!**

**-""Some of the people on this trail are very aggressive. They just sprint right past you.""** Yeah Juice. It's because you're a big annoying group going slow and you're all serving terrible hiking etiquette by walking the way you are on the trail. Single file lines, assholes.

\-Tom bringing up hiking etiquette but not bringing up the fact they're walking like assholes. Damn.

**-""Are we not allowed to just say merry Christmas""** Damn, you got me Justin that was really fucking funny genuinely. have a hearty laugh at that.

\-""Dilberts Rotten Crotch"" Hey guys... are the mcelroys actually still funny after all these years??? damn....

\-Hey gamers... do not fuck with a saguaro cactus. One because it's impolite but two because they're federally protected much like the Giant Sequoia trees. And don't film yourselves committing a crime??? And don't encourage your viewers to commit a crime????

\-Justin has committed many a food crime in his time as a podcaster. This is probably one of the worst ones. jfc. stop eating freezedried meals raw.

\-Nobody fucking calls it gorp anymore except asshole 20-somethings who spent $2,000 at REI on clothing they wear to yoga and cava bars.

**-""it's terribly dry.""**  Griffin you're dehydrated,

It's not Granola Oats Rasins and Peanuts its ""Good Ol' Raisins and Peanuts."" Fake ass gorp fan. Call it trail mix like the rest of us you poser fuck.

\-Justin's backpack is open lmao. 

\-The slow shambling walk down hill. These good good boys are very tired it seems. You can always tell when a hiker is at their limits, and it's the slow shaky shamble walk downhill. minute 8:40 for those interested in seeing it. **Look out for hikers like this**; if they're far enough from any kind of good stopping point it's a good idea to let them know you notice they're getting kind of shaky and recommend they stop for a second to let their body rest.

**-""you had 3 open pockets you fucking child.""** griffin is me 2 minutes ago.

\-Laughing my ass off that Travis Scr\*ps McElroy had a whole podcast episode about Leave No Trace and yet here he is... trying to take a fucking rock. It makes me so mad.

\-For the past 3 minutes I've been unable to pay attention to a single word they're saying about gollum or whatever the fuck because I can see people behind them that want to pass but are being too polite to do so because of the cameras. it's so fucking distracting.

\-Travis learning like an out-of-state ASU Freshman Sorority Girl first hand why you shouldn't wear makeup while hiking. LMAO.

\-The brother's theorizing about the mystic past of the old worn trail path lmao. It's just an old trail path lmao. Back before we stopped making trials like that because of their impact on the environment. Now we just leave trails as dirt.

\-Justin stop walking off trail. seriously. making me so fucking mad. Same with the filmer. pissing me the fuck off.

\-Lmao clint. Living the AZ resort life. 

  
**Okay, what did we learn:** Overall, funny episode. Would have preferred they picked a less busy trail to film on so they wouldn't have been so disruptive to other hikers. I like them doing stuff like this in person. The effort really comes back. Pretty good overall, a sold 8/10 from me. 

Stay on trials and drink water. Keep your grades up. That's all.

(And we wait)

The whole world is ending, but Milo still hasn’t done damn the dishes.

I sit at the kitchen table, arms crossed, staring at the sink full of plates, crusted with last week’s pasta. The mold looks to be doing better than most people right now.
I turn my head to the mostly open window hoping to see something less depressing.
The air outside is thick with smoke, curling through the atmosphere like spectre, it brings with it the smell of burning plastic, fuel, shot powder… and bodies. 
Gunfire rattles, like lightning in the distance. And I see the flashing light of explosions far away. 
The sound of it all isn’t too close, but it’s close enough.

Inside, though, it’s quiet.
Not the peaceful kind of quiet. The kind that stretches, pulls tight on you, and pushes you through the floor.
Olivia stands by the window, finishing the last of her cigarette—at least, I think it’s a cigarette. She sucks it down like it’s the only thing anchoring her to the floor.
Milo leans against the fridge, staring at… nothing. His pink laces are untied, leaving his boots splayed open and loose. His hair’s a greasy blond mess.
Jo, the oldest, sits hunched over a map in his armchair, his hands massaging his temples while he studies it. The paper is covered in red and blue boxes. His breath is slow, and he’s mumbling some jargon I don’t understand.

No one’s sleeping tonight.
They don’t say why.
They don’t have to.
I may be young, but I know what’s coming.
I hear it in the way Olivia toys endlessly with her piercings, the the slow, ritualistic crack of Jo’s knuckles, in the way Milo checks the safety on his rifle—once, twice, again, as if it might reset when he blinks.
They don’t talk about the war anymore. It’s not a war when it reaches your front door. It’s just old news.
A gust of wind rattles the last loose pane in our only  window. Olivia flicks her cigarette out into the street below. The ember falls, slowly down the high-rise, finally vanishing into the dark.

“Reckon we’ve got ‘til morning,” she says, voice rough.

Milo exhales. “Maybe.”

No one looks at each other.
I pick up the old candle on the table, rolling it between my hands. The wax is hard from the cold. It won’t be lit anytime soon. It’s too small to give light but too big to throw away.
We can’t risk a light tonight anyway.
On que a gunshot cracks. Closer.
We hear shouting and footsteps down below, far too close for comfort.
Then, they quickly fade away.
Olivia’s fingers twitch nervously, and Milo straightens sharply.
Mo stays deep in his thoughts, thinking about his next strategy.

Olivia told me he used to be her history professor at the university, back when there was still a university to teach at.
He was the kind of professor students either loved or feared—sharp-tongued, endlessly patient in his anger, but relentless in his questioning. He didn’t just teach his expertise; he made his students live in it, made them argue against the dead, made them justify every belief they carried in their heads.
Milo said his office was always full of crumpled papers, made up of half-drunk ramblings that matured into “6 a.m. half-drunk-coffee-cup thoughts”.
Milo would know, though. He must have spent a lot of time in that office getting lectured about his academic performance.
But that was all before my time.
Now, Mo is a man without a classroom, without a podium, without a captive audience.
He is just another revolutionary without a revolution.
We all sit still, as if the long-passed battle might come back to find us.

Then—

A knock at the door.
Not hesitant. Not polite.
A sharp, urgent 
bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang,
frantic. It won’t stop.
No one breathes.
Jo’s fingers tighten around the pistol on his table.
Olivia moves first, pressing her back to the wall beside the door.
Another pounding at the door.
This time harder. Louder.
Then a voice. Hoarse. Shaking. Familiar.

“Let me in!”

I know that voice.

Lena

After what felt like an eternity of breathlessness, Olivia moved to along the wall next to the door frame unbolted our ply wood safety net whilst more aimed his rusty gun in the middle of the void.
Lena stepped inside, alone, 
the terror of the city coming with her.
The stink of smoke, of sweat, of blood. 
The scent of everything wrong trailing behind her like a demon shadow.
The door clicks shut, but it didn’t matter. 
The war is inside now.
She swayed where she stood.
Her coat is half-burned. Her hands black with soot, her face streaked with something dark—maybe blood, maybe ash, maybe both.
No one moves.
No one rushes to her
Because no one’s sure if she’s really here and r a ghost who doesn’t know she’s dead yet.
Then Mo, finally taking any kind of action, gets up and hugs her.
“Lena?” He sobs, unsure if he can trust that she’s really here. 
Lena exhales. A long, shaking breath escapes her. She leans against the doorframe and sinks to the floor.
Jo stands, slow. “What happened?”
Lena swallows, her throat choking her words. When they do come out, they sound hollow.

“They burned the district.”

The silence that follows is thick like. It settles into the walls, the floor, the space between us.

But she keeps talking.

“They came before dusk. Paramilitaries. Private guys. Not even insignia on ‘em this time —just guns, fire, and hate.”
A pause. A swallow. A shake of the head. “Blocked the exits they knew about, shot anyone slow enough to stay behind. Then they set the buildings alight, one by one.”

Another silence. Heavier than the first.
Jo sits back down. Olivia’s face hardens. Milo grips the back of a chair like it’s the only thing keeping him upright.

Lena exhales, sharp. A laugh. But there’s nothing funny about it.
“It’s over.”
They collapsed our tunnels. God knows who told them about ‘em.
But we are…
We…
We won’t make it past the metro or the district now, we are boxed in!!
 
Milo exclaimed. “So Ethan was right, we should have listened god damn it”




Ethan, was a long-gone friend, told me about our Historie, that the revolution started the way they always do.
Small. Desperate. 
Bourn from too many mouths left empty, too many hands left broken from labor, too many lives chewed up and spat out by people who never even cared to learn our names.
We were lucky that the war had started when it did, that the nation was already weak from the years of near-peer fighting that had worn it down.
So we  took the opportunity and burned the first power station. Sabotaged the first train line. Dragged the first officers into the street.
And for a while. 
We were winning.
But nothing good lasts, our great nation got wise. 
They got hired guns. The kind of men who only exist when war lets them.
The kind with no vested interests. No place to call home. No flags to swear too. No names. With black patches, black masks, shooting white phosphorus, and yelling white power.
I think out  fighting doesn’t matter anymore. Not in the way it used to. The ones who could’ve changed things are buried under rubble, or strung up in the plazas, or pressed into mass graves with dozens of others jist like them.

What’s left is people like us. The ones who won’t stop breathing, even when the city tells us we should.
But breath isn’t enough. Survival isn’t enough.
And tomorrow, if we live to see the sun rise,
we’ll still be here. Waiting.
For Milo to do the god damn dishes.

I'm a guy in my mid-20s and I make about $160,000 a year in a MCOL high tax area.  I moved for my old job and now have a new job where I work remotely.  I'm single and don't have kids.  Financially my 2 big priorities are retirement savings and saving for a down payment on a house.  I also have some student loan debt I'm trying to pay off in the next 5 years. Fortunately I'm able to max out my 401k and my company gives a very good match.  I'm making some decent progress saving for a house, but not as much as I'd like.  I'd also like to have a bigger emergency fund. 

  
I've been looking over my budget and one area where I could cut back is I could go out less.  I don't go out a ton, but I might go out for dinner one night a week and drinks another night a week.  Sometimes I'll get coffee on Saturday morning too. I also travel a bit to see my friends and family as I don't really know anyone where I currently live. Dating certainly isn't cheap as a man either.  

I already try to really take advantage of the free activities in my area, but I'm still finding it hard to meet and interact with people there.  I certainly could cut going out even more than I do, but then I might go a week without talking to another person.  How do people who are single in a new city have a social life while also saving money?  Any advice would be appreciated. ",0,1742578311.0,MiddleClassFinance,17,0.27,False

1jgmfrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1jgmfrp/sleep_issues/,Sleep Issues,"Hello! For some reason the past 2 days I have taken vyvanse 30 mg (the only time i’ve taken it this week) I have been having way more sleep troubles than I normally do. I haven’t been able to fall asleep and i’m having to take melatonin, I keep waking up in the middle of the night and waking up way too early and i’m getting around 5 hours of sleep. I never felt this way on the adderall (switched off due to physiological effects) and with vyvanse before until now, I think it’s because I have been now having vyvanse with coffee and both are making me stay awake, but coffee is the only way to make my medication work and stay working for a long time.

Is there anything else I can consume instead of caffeine that will make the medication work? I ordered L-tyrosine online to take with my medication, as I heard  it increases the strength and longevity of vyvanse from this subreddit. How long should I wait to take it after taking my medication? Do you recommend this or any other supplements or anything I can take that won’t keep me awake at night? Is there another stimulant that does not have these effects as much? Not getting enough sleep in turn makes my medication not work as strong either. I never felt this way when I was just taking adderall or just taking vyvanse without coffee, but if I have vyvanse without coffee I barely even feel it. I am taking vyvanse at 7:30 am and coffee at 9:30 am.

  
I am also possibly going to switch to dyanavel. Is this stimulant or any other stimulant easier on sleeping?",1,1742578246.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

CW: 243 lb
H: 6’-2”

If I had one piece of advice for those experiencing constipation, it would be to consume more fiber, I prefer Metamucil in addition to a diet change.

Metamucil (or any fiber supplement really) helps keep me regular, and curbs hunger. It does make me a feel a little bloated, but it’s not bad and I’ve gotten used to it. But with it you gotta drink PLENTY of water. Without water it doesn’t do much to help keep you regular. I drink it in the morning before I drink my coffee, and then I’ll also have a glass when I get home from work. If you’ve never had it before I recommend starting at half the recommended amount for a few days, and then after a week or so increasing it to the normal serving size.

I’ve drank fiber supplements on-and-off for a couple of years now and it really does make me feel a lot better. The foods in the U.S. suck with fiber, so adding this really helps even if you’re not on GLP-1. Being on the medication has made me more constipated so I have to be more consistent with the fiber supplements, but it works to keep me regular so I’ll stick with it!",3,1742578218.0,HimsWeightloss,0,1.0,False

Finland has **more lakes than any other country in Europe**—about 188,000! That’s a lot of places to take a refreshing dip or go ice fishing in the winter.

🌲 **2. More Saunas Than People?**  
Okay, not quite, but Finland has **over 3 million saunas** for a population of about 5.5 million. That means almost every Finn has access to a sauna, whether it’s at home, at work, or even in a Burger King (yes, Helsinki has a Burger King with a sauna).

🦅 **3. Finnish People Invented... Competing at Weird Things**  
Finland is home to some of the world’s most bizarre competitions, like:

* **Wife Carrying Championship** (Eukonkanto) – where husbands carry their wives through an obstacle course for a prize equal to the wife’s weight in beer.
* **Air Guitar World Championship** – because who needs a real guitar when you have imagination?
* **Swamp Soccer** – like regular soccer, but played in a muddy swamp.

🕰 **4. Midsummer Magic**  
On **Juhannus (Midsummer)**, Finland gets almost **24 hours of sunlight** in the north! People celebrate with bonfires, sauna sessions, and a whole lot of partying. It’s basically nature’s way of saying, “Make the most of this before the long, dark winter returns.”

❄ **5. Home of the Real Santa Claus**  
Santa Claus *officially* lives in **Rovaniemi, Lapland**, where you can visit his village, meet the elves, and even cross into the Arctic Circle. Sorry, North Pole, Finland has you beat.

🥶 **6. The Coldest Temperature Recorded in Finland**  
The lowest temperature ever recorded in Finland was **-51.5°C (-60.7°F)** in 1999. That's colder than your ex’s heart.

💙 **7. Finns Are Some of the Happiest People on Earth**  
Despite the cold and darkness, Finland has been named the **happiest country in the world** multiple times in the annual World Happiness Report. Maybe it’s all the saunas, lakes, and coffee (Finns drink the most coffee per capita in the world!).

**Memory Transcription Subject: Solvak, Unworthy yet Dutiful Speh** 

*Date \[standardized Terran time\]: September 25, 1960* 

The fallout from the Speaker’s address had been as colossal as it was predictable. Every new station in the system was running the broadcast on loop as their anchors and personalities hotly debated between themselves about the ramifications and consequences of the address. Pundits of all stripes and creed verbally sparred in increasing heated discussions that quickly tottered on the edge of becoming physical. 

The local social media networks were likewise full to bursting with people blasting their opinions across the public forum. Most were various reactions that could be summed up between the gamut of shellshocked disbelief, smug satisfaction, and fervent disapproval, though as expected from online discourse, there were several virial strains consisting conspiracy theories, wildly racist remarks, rambling, disjointed rants and so on. 

Azad had been staring at his holopad in slack jawed astonishment when we returned, scrolling through threads that updated by the moment. Quall sat on his shoulder, reading through the posts with a frown which only seemed to deepen with time. Zerka sat on the couch, silent as he watched a debate between a trio personalities made up of a Terra-Sol Kolshian, a non-native Farsul, and a human. 

“...ying that this is a bad thing?” The human asked, brushing a pale silver lock behind his ear. 

“Well, it sure as hell isn’t great.” The Kolshian said, folding her arms. “I’m surprised you even agreed to show up, Yves. Thought you would’ve been celebrating with your Jovian buddies.” 

“While it's a momentous occasion and comes after many hard fought years of efforts, I wouldn’t be so arrogant as to assume the battle is over quite yet.” The human said, adjusting his glasses. “There’s still the matter of freeing our Kolshian and Farsul brethren from their bondage, a task that the TSA officials seem rather hush about.” 

“Because it's a stupid idea. Its reckless, bullheaded, and liable to get all of us killed because you people need to be the galaxy’s ‘Great Saviors’.” The Kolshian rolled her eyes and an irritated undulation of fronds. 

“I don’t see you coming up with ideas.” The Farsul quipped, shooting a look at the other woman. “All you Martians ever seem to do is say how every idea the Jovians have are bad and never offer an alternative besides sitting on our paws and hiding.” 

“Serious, Kitte? I thought you were on my side!”  

“Obviously she’s become enlightened to the failings of your people and its passive government.” The human cut in with a casual tone that practically dripped with smugness. 

“The only thing my time on Titan enlightened me to is that Jovians love being right even more than rockheads.” Kitte said, her eyes slashing into him and drawing a flinch. “I’m still on your side, Fahla. However, I’m also not naive enough to believe that the council won’t try and use this as an excuse to kick the issue of freeing Servants down the road.” 

“In favor of what exactly? The Titanian strategy of running screeching into the nearest Republic colony guns blazing, freeing slaves and torching all the orphanages on our way out?” 

“Do you constantly have to throw that incident in our faces? We’ve already disavowed that charter and have taken more cautious measures for the future.” The human clicked his tongue as he shook his head. “And it was a hospital, not an orphanage. As if a Mayan has any business taking moral high ground.” 

“The hell you say, you prissy, chrome-dome fop?” The Kolshian growled as she rose to her feet. 

“I’m just stating a fact. We all know your so-called ‘empire’s stance when it comes to the practice of capturing-” The man’s words went unfinished as the woman leapt across the gap between them, arms curling over his arm and throat as they crashed into the floor before the screen shifted into a screen showing a stylized rodent lifting its shoulders under a banner that translated into ‘technical difficulties’. 

It wouldn’t be the last program the cartoonish rodent intervened with that evening. 

And while the TSA seemed to be in a fit over the announcement, it utterly paled in comparison to the Terrans’ reaction. What had been an uproar when we finally managed to pull ourselves into slumber had erupted into a frenzied conflagration upon our waking the following morning. 

When my escourt came for me and Jolsk, I’d seen the Mercer family and the Farsul sat before their TV screen, eyes fixed to a report from an alien rodent as they relayed the situation on the ground. Complete pandemonium had consumed large pockets of Terran civilization, public services were overwhelmed as citizens took to the streets in roving crowds causing all manner of discord with their blind terror. Stores were overrun with panicked shoppers reduced to base tribalism as they fought over canned goods and toiletries.  

 There was footage from other regions that showed riots and revolts breaking out amongst the several racial groups, raising their fists and improvised weapons high as they stormed government buildings and the residents of officials. A large continent called Africa seemed the most affected as populations of Kolsul waged war with human soldiers and militiamen. Another large nation named China was also in the throes of a brewing insurrection, this time by the humans who charged through towns and cities like a great, vicious tide given sentient. 

Other places weren’t so extreme, though their was clear tension in the air as confusion ran rampant, as their people demanded in increasingly pleading tones if what they’d heard yesterday had indeed been true. Many vouched for the broadcast’s authenticity while others withheld judgement until proper professional could offer their answers. Others dismissed it as a massive hoax, while others still used it as justification to lay grievance at the feet of their enemies, as was the case in a dispute between the powers of Brazil and Colombia.  

Their own nation, a country named The United States, was suffering a series of riots and protests in nearly every major city as crowds flooded the places of power and demanded answers. Looting and disorder were quickly spreading as the population panicked, tensions sublimated into violence as the various racial and ethnic groups began to fight amongst each other. Not even a full \[day\] had passed and civilization seemed to be at the point of collapse. 

Their own settlement was faring better than most but even it was quickly being overwhelmed as fearful citizens poured through the streets, some holding signs or raised fists as them marched upon their city hall. A barricade had been erected and was being manned by a human officer barking into a megaphone, attempting to wrangle the people into order and barely managing. 

Jolsk’s arms were wrapped around his family who huddled close to him, the Farsul from before standing behind the couch as his claws dug into the upholstery. It was a poor scene to leave off on but unfortunately more pressing matters called for our attention. The large Kolshian kept his family close as we made our way through a Rec gate into the shipyard, the port absolutely swarming with people though our area was thankfully clear, no doubt thanks to the armed personnel forming a perimeter.  

The two of us said our goodbyes for now, our escort graciously allowing us a few moments for a proper sendoff. Jolsk’s shoulders shook as he hugged his family, his wife and son likewise quaking with unbridled emotion as it likely dawned on them that we were walking into the shadestalker’s den. Brenden in particularly seemed reluctant to leave him, even begging to be brought along though his father quickly shot down such suggestions not wanting to risk his safety. 

I found myself sharing a similar sentiment as I held my little one tightly, firmly denying his own requests to join me on our voyage. It hurt to see his eyes glisten with tears but I bit back the impulse to relent and instead tried to infuse as much warm affection into my embrace as possible before parting.  

Wugul had promised to look after him in my stead and on a quieter, more somber whisper agreed to take him in should the worst befall me. Ralcho had looked ill as he stood there, eyes bloodshot and pose devoid of his usual swagger, though he managed enough energy for a parting embrace, which I used to tell him to be strong. Zerka had presented a closed-fisted salute which I returned but just as I turned away, a pair of bulky arms smothered me for a heartbeat or two before rapidly vanishing, the Arxur pointedly looking away with a bright bloom. 

Delma had marched up to me and gripped the back of my head, bringing our foreheads together as she stared heatedly into my eyes. She promptly threatened to use my as a blade sharpener if I failed to return alive and though a part of me wished I wouldn’t I agreed to her terms. She stared at me for a while longer before she was satisfied and pulled away, moving towards the Farsul as he finished his own farewell to the elder Mercer. 

Then, to my and the shock of all of those present, she grabbed the canine’s paw, the man turning his head and smiling down at her before raising their joined palms and placing his lips atop them. Adrenaline surged through me as I felt my stance shift, ready to intervene in her reprisal at his audacity allow to be blindsided by her rolling her eyes and leaning up to lightly lick his cheek.  

I felt the world tilt for a beat, my eyes honed forward at the improbable exchange which had garnered attention even from passersby outside the zone. The Gojid had just stood there, flabbergasted as he tried to form sentences as his Yotul partner gaped at the pair in the first signs of expressive emotion I’d seen from him in over a day. Zerka was the first to shake off his stupor and ask the obvious question. 

Delma’s response had been a confirmation that yes, the two of them were indeed together now or ‘going steady’ as the Farsul, whose name was apparently Lucki, put it. The Mercers seemed less phased by this revelation than we were, Brenden walking over to congratulate his friend of his new relationship while Liana had flashed a broad smile as she went about introducing herself to Delma and expunging the virtues of her new paramour. Jolsk had scrolled over and placed an arm on his shoulder, jabbing the tip of one into the younger man’s chest and having him promise to not do anything sinful until we returned. 

With that, we boarded the vessel which was a compact yet streamlined design I’d not seen before and in quick fashion were propelled from the yard and into the void of space and then soon after into FTL. Which brought us back to the present as the pair of us sat in a living area, Jolsk staring with eyes wide with equal parts wonder, awe and terror. It was easy for me to forget that despite his appearance, the man had never experienced space travel outside of movies and books, neither of which could fully capture the majesty of the cosmos. 

Such awe was largely beyond me at this point; space travel was such a regular activity for me that I scarcely paid it much attention these days. Familiarity had dulled the luster of the universe’s natural machinations as had my duty which had trained me to see the unknown as a possible hideaway for wicked Kolsul which had only diminished it further. Even knowing better now and how horrible my actions had truly been couldn’t hold back the encroaching boredom that threatened to crash over me. A shame and concern as it left me nothing to bother with than the mission before us. 

After voicing my intentions to find something for breakfast, I rise to my feet and began making my way through the connecting corridor. Despite its smaller size, its interior was surprisingly spacious, though that was likely merely a consequence of having to cater to taller species, with several doors and hatches at various levels along the walkway. I ponder for a moment as I wonder where exactly the kitchen would be located before taking a chance on a nearby door. 

Before he could, however, the metal slid open, revealing the towering form of a human, mid-stride with his head in his pad. A yelp escaped him as he stumbled back to as he noticed me, grabbing the frame of the door as his pad fumbled through his fingers and towards the floor. My reflexes save it from a disastrous fate, digits catching it a hair from the hard flooring before I righted myself and presented it back to its owner. 

The human’s face slacked in relief before he seemed to fully notice me and his expression curdled with visible disdain and anger, a response I found perfectly reasonable given they previous conduct. *It's the proper reaction you deserve for what you are. He sees the monster in you and is naturally repulsed.* A breeze steals over my palm as the man snatches his pad and roughly pushes past me, elbow jabbing at my head as he stomps away.  

A part of me rankles at his rudeness, but I hold my tongue. I hadn’t any ground to speak on things such as politeness or common curtesy. Still, my feet carry me forward as a sentence bubbled up my throat and over my tongue. 

“Do you know where the kitchen is?” My words cause the man’s steps to falter as he slowly turns his head to glare at me. “Me and my compatriot missed breakfast earlier.” 

“And how’s that my problem?” He spat and again, I balk at his tone but I let it pass. 

“We’re to assist the TSA in their bid with the Republic and the task would be easier served if we were both properly fed.” 

Blue eyes stab at me, my wool practically frizzing under the heat of his stare before he let’s out a derisive snort and turns back around. He makes it a few steps forward before he glares back at me and jerks his head, a growling groan rumbling from him at my incomprehension before he raised an arm and signs \[Follow.\] as well as something that my implant translates into ‘mental handicapped ungulate’. Curious about the term but not wanting to push his already knife thin hospitality, I trail after him silently. 

We step up a small ramp and through a door that opens into a modest-sized, pentagon shaped room. A kitchenette sits tucked into one of the corners while a set of rather plain tables with matching, sloped chairs fill the floor with an entertainment system lining one of the walls. It was a suitably relaxed space, helped by the plants sat on the sill of the window which showed a view of the streaking barrage of hyperspace outside. 

The human makes his way towards the counter, reaching up into one of the cabinets and pulling out a dark rectangle wrapped in plastic. He then moved to the refrigerator and started retrieving amore items, such as a jar, a pouch, a small white oblong, and a broad, green leaf. Dexterous digits untied the rectangle and plunked a small section free before a pan on the stove and clicking it on. As he continued to go about fixing his meal, I took the time to peruse the contents of the fridge for my own sustenance.  

The contents were largely alien to me, having never gotten a look at the pantry or Liana’s cooking before she’d worked her talent with it, so I defaulted to smell in this instance. I managed to cobble together a decent enough plate of fruit and greens for myself, ducking in once more to retrieve a small bag full of insects labeled ‘weevils’ and a red delicious for Jolsk. Gathering my haul, I made my way towards the door only for it to hiss open and reveal a familiar figure standing in the frame. 

“There ya are.” The Terran said “Was wondering where ya’ll went. Oh, need help with that?” 

“Only if you don’t mind.” I was more than happy to carry our food, but the Kolshian struck me as the type to lend a paw, or rather tentacle, even when not prompted. “I hope my choices were suitable.” 

“More than.” He said, pulling open the bag and pulling out one of the insects within. “Been a while since I’ve had longnose and these look fresh.” 

We took a seat at one of the table and after the large man completed his pre-meal ritual, we tucked in. The fruit I’d picked was apparently called a pear and had a flavor that was milder than the apples I’d indulged in prior but were no less delicious. Jolsk meanwhile was chomping through his longnose with relish, humming lowly with each audible crunch. After a while, Jolsk rose from his seat for a drink which brought him close to the human as he was finishing up his preparations.  

While the Terran went about making a cup of something he called ‘coffee’, he struck up conversation with the other man. Unlike his brief and hostile interactions with me, he seemed much more open and animated around the Kolshian, speaking with a casual cadence that dipped into a joking measure. The sight tugged a rueful smile from me, knowing the Sheriff could easily find company yet had chosen to chain himself to me out of misguided compassion. He deserves better than a worthless wretch such as yourself. 

My self-pitying is interrupted by a loud scrap as Jolsk returns with the human in tow who takes his place with obvious hesitance. I offer an ear flick which he acknowledges with a bob of his head as he grips his...culinary curiosity in his paws before taking a sizable bite out of it. 

“What is that?” I ask politely and get silence in return. 

“It’s called a sandwich. A regular stable for plenty of folks' back state-side. Or I guess Earth-side?” The man’s brows furrow as he chews his breakfast thoughtfully. “What would the proper word even be fer that?” 

“Planet-side, though plenty of people use different slang depending on the region, customs, langauge, or mood.” The human provided helpfully as he took another bite. “Planet-side should work fine, however.” 

“Hell take it, I can already feel the headache comin’.” The Terran slouched forward as he kneaded his temple. 

“I can help with it, if you’d like.” I offered and received a stunted flick from his short fronds before he raised his tail and firmly flicked his tail.  

The meal passed by without incident, though the human’s eyes always seemed to be homed in on me even when answering one of Jolsk’s questions. I was able to learn the man’s name thankfully, having given it out with managed reluctance when I asked him. Kulakov was from a moon of their system’s gas giant by the name of Titan, the largest moon in Sol and home of the Jovian Union which were the Outer regions governing body.  

After finishing up, my comrade offered the human a place on our slice of the living area, and he seemed to grabble with suggestion for a while before eventually accepting and following us back. We spent the rest of the day in there, sitting in a comfortable silence marred only by the Titanian’s constant stare, chatting about current events, and even engaging in a bit of playful sparring. When the time came for rest, the human seemed to have warmed up to the Kolshian a fair bit, though the jovial mien evaporated the instant his gaze landed on me. 

When I next woke, it was with a heavy weight on my shoulders. The colorful array of FTL had dissipated as we landed back in real space having reached our destination. The designated meeting zone turned out to be a modest research station built into an asteroid, its construction bearing the architectural hallmarks of some unknown species.  

The station, however, was not the primary focus of the view. Looming behind it was the fierce facade of a Destroyer flanked by several cruisers and smaller ships, a cursory glance hardly needed to know that each and every one of them were gilded to the hilt in wartime armaments. It certainly made their feelings clear, I supposed. 

“So, that’s your people?” Jolsk asked, his voice level though his wide eyes and trembling limbs told me all I needed to know of his true feelings. “They definitely look...impressive.” 

“Impressively overdone, you mean.” Kulakov quipped, stepping up beside us in his full military attire, his rifle slung over his shoulder. “As if we needed further proof that this meeting is a deathtrap.” 

“Skalgans don’t do traps, Lieutenant.” The splotched patched Farsul from the trail said as he stepped forward, adjusting his uniform. “They are a fierce, warrior culture that prizes honor and perseverance as virtues above all others. When they do battle, they do so as straightforward and fair as possible, which is why they hardly utilize bombing measures on planet-side threats. Though I am curious about what our resident Skalgan expert might think on the matter.” 

It took me a few moments to realize he was speaking of me and a few more to arrange my scattered thoughts into a reasonable order.  

“It's an intimation tactic.” I surmise, turning to give the man my full attention. “Meant to show our overwhelming military prowess as a means of scaring our opposition into submission or at least to cause hesitation.” 

“Doin’ a helluva job.” The Kolshian muttered under his breath, arm twitching towards his pocket where I knew his rolled tubes lied. 

“Why are we still even here, sir?” Kulakov asked with a hard frown. “The Republic clearly means to strike us down the moment we’re in firing range. We should cut our losses now and focus on an attack plan-” 

“They gave their word they wouldn’t attack us.” 

“And we’re just suppose believe them? The same people who even now keep hundreds of millions of innocents in bondage?” 

The Farsul said nothing as he stared down the human in a silent battle of wills, the brawny primate eventually averting his gaze as the canine’s flicked towards me.  

“The delegate will be made of two Warchiefs, a representative from the Leirn Bureau of Commerce, the Tinsas Revitalization Board, and the Colian Insitute of Health and Care. Given the makeup, how difficult do you think a dialouge will be to establish?” 

“...The Yotul and Sivkit will likely try to block most avenues as both heavily depend on Servants to sustain much of their economies, the latter especially had a rather infamous distaste for the Kolsul. The Zurulian would make for a strong ally as they’ve famously refused the Servitude System since its inception and were one of the leading votes against it. As for the Warchiefs...” 

“It’ll depend on who we’re dealing with.” The Farsul said, finishing my thought. “Unfortunately, while they sent a message with their titles, we don’t yet have names to put to them.” 

“Can’t ya-Can you not just pull up information like with Solvak and his people?” My brow raises at the sudden switch in vernacular from the Terran, but I let it pass. 

“Their using a more advanced encryption format, one that we can’t pierce without more time than we currently have.” He sighed, rubbing the bridge of his snout with a digit and thumb. “I suppose we’ll just have to this Terran-style, I suppose.” 

“What does that entail, exactly?” I asked with a quirk of my head. 

“We improvise.” His lips pull into a sharp smile at my unmasked concern. “Don’t fret, Mr. Solvak. If there’s one thing us Terrans are good at, it’s turning a seemingly poor situation in our favor.” 

*Welcome back everyone’s favorite Freedom raider and arsonist advocate, Kulakov! I’m sure he’ll bring a measured and sensible perspective to these delicate discussions. Next time, our heroes exchange words, pleasantries, and threats with their adversaries.*  

*This week’s question: You are one of the people at the table, how would you approach the situation? What would you’re opening move be? Until next time, have a great day!* ",10,1742577821.0,NatureofPredators,1,1.0,False

**1. Fuentes Kitchen – 94 Genesee St., Utica**

With inspiration from multiple cultures, Uziel Fuentes opened Fuentes Kitchen, an upscale but casual restaurant.

“It’s Asian and Mexican fusion. Very unique dishes, I don’t really have anything traditional on the menu,” Fuentes said. “It’s more for me to bring new food to the Utica population.”



A few of Fuentes' most popular dishes. (Emily Kenny/Spectrum News 1)

Fuentes moved to New York from North Carolina, where his family operated several restaurants, and cooking has always been part of his history. One of the most popular dishes is a salmon risotto, he said.

“It’s made with edamame, shiitake mushrooms, shallots and it has an agave chipotle glaze on top to give it a little bit of smokiness and sweetness to the salmon. I feel like it complements the risotto on the bottom, which is made with sushi rice,” he said.

Another popular menu item is the Korean fajita mac and cheese — a sweet Korean beef, peppers, onions and mac and cheese made with cotija cheese. The restaurant doesn’t have a liquor license yet, but Fuentes said he has a plan for when he does.

“I’m working with my bar staff to create a few cocktail menus, but I know I have a dragon fruit margarita coming out. I have a matcha martini and some other Asian and Mexican inspired cocktails,” Fuentes said. “I want to expand my non-alcoholic beverage menu to have hibiscus tea, Vietnamese coffee and some other options for our customers.""

**2. Beef and Bird – 106 Genesee St., Utica**

A fast-casual restaurant that focuses on beef and chicken will open “when the birds return,” said owner Tucker Rosemyer.

“It will be roast beef sandwiches in the forms of French dip, beef and cheddars with homemade cheese sauces. French fries fried in beef tallow; poutine is going to be another one of our staples there,” Rosemyer said.

With more than 20 years of experience in restaurants, Rosemyer said he developed a recipe for a fried chicken sandwich that is also cooked in beef tallow. Beef and Bird will be a seed oil-free restaurant. Some familiar types of seed oils are canola, peanut, grapeseed, soybean and corn oils.

“One of my daughters has a health issue, so it’s been important for me to go seed oil-free. For the years I’ve been in the business, I’ve had a conscience about the products that I’m using,” Rosemyer said.

1886 Prime in Frankfurt, Rosemyer’s other restaurant, also uses beef tallow, and he said he has had a great response to it. He said it is a healthier option to frying with traditional seed oils.

“It gives me a sense of pride that I’m able to create something healthier for people,” Rosemyer said. “What I’m trying to create is a fast-food, in a healthy fashion, something where things are made from scratch. It's very simple and it’s fresh, nothing frozen.”

**3. Silk – 104 Genesee St., Utica** 

Silk is a new cocktail and dessert bar in Utica. The all black and pink bar was designed and created by CEO Tyler Young.

“I wanted to nod at that, make it kind of sexy and moody. I also love black everything, so I went with the whole Marilyn Monroe theme, modernized it a little bit with some hot pinks,” Young said.

The menu has a variety of cocktails and desserts available, but their most popular dessert menu item has been the strawberry fantasy.

“It is a play on a sushi roll. It's made of cake, mascarpone, fresh strawberries, fresh strawberry jam and it’s garnished with the strawberry crunch ice cream bar, like from \[our\] childhood. It’s sliced to serve with green icing on the side, so it looks like wasabi and ginger and comes with chopsticks,” Young said.

Silk serves all kinds of cocktails from sweet to savory, Young said.

“One of our biggest sellers is Carrie Bradshaw in a pleated skirt. It’s a revamped Silk twist cosmopolitan. It comes with an aromatic citrus cloud bubble on top and people love that. It’s a showstopper,” he said.

Since opening, availability at the new bar has been limited, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays. Reservations are available online, and Young highly recommends making them.

“If we get complaints, it’s about our table turn times because we have so many people, we have such a demand and we’ve had to turn people away at the door because we simply can’t fit any more in here,” he said. “We are packed all night long.”",4,1742577697.0,Utica,0,0.83,False

I pored over elevation maps each night in fearful apprehension, and by each morning the road sat up to meet me like a clay-colored fist. Altiplanic dunes changing color by the hour. Stampedes of sand and unrelenting headwind. Nameless jeep tracks through the dust of rocky shrapnel. I kept thinking that the hardest parts were behind me, but they never stopped coming.

Over the Hill of Black Death at +16,100 ft [4,907 m]. Past the Salvador Dalí Desert. Past Laguna Colorada, then Laguna Blanca. When I finally hiked my bike into the Bolivian aduana [customs] exit office, I laid down on the floor in spent exhaustion. Their tiny outpost was the day’s sole escape from the wind which roared outside like a subsonic war horn, specters of emptiness in all directions.

From there I pushed through the remaining daylight hours to reach the Chilean border office in time, a small A-frame structure in the literal middle of nowhere. Immigrations officers cheered my approach, whistling with one fist in the air. Their green army fatigues were sharply pressed. Hair slicked back and cleanly shaven. I shared some dried apricots and they offered hot coffee, advising me to stay with them overnight because the sun was setting and it would be too dangerous to bike further. I rolled out my sleeping bag in the corner and curled up like a dog.

Most people head west from there towards San Pedro de Atacama. But I was too tired for more, not wanting to climb back up the notorious switchbacks en route. I turned left instead, another 75 miles atop dizzying lunar altitudes for Paso Jama, the only open border crossing into Argentina.

More Mars-like desert. More lassos of wind. Extraterrestrial valleys with mineral lakes in odd pastels. Flamingos and flightless Rhea birds dotted the outskirts. I stopped often but not for photos, just to breathe, turning back at each barbed hilltop to watch the horizon wither in the distance.

I am F (27) with an anxious attachment style who was seeing someone for a little bit and M (27) with an avoidance attachment style and who is emotionally unavailable.

Things started strong. We went on a coffee date as our first date and had a fantastic time. I'm not sure how to explain our chemistry, but it was something else. Something I haven't felt in a while. Not only do we have so much in common but our lifestyle and our goals are in line. I know it was only the first date and for me to get this excited over someone was a big deal to me. We had our second date and did an activity where we shared his favorite hobby - golfing. This second date was a big step for me since I usually never make it past the first date.

With this second date, I wanted to get nitty gritty asking him deeper questions. When the conversation came up about dating he said he wasn't into dating. I sat there wondering wtf was I doing here then. One thing my therapist has told me was to get curious - ask why. So I did...he was very hesitant to tell me about it. He eventually did. He said he had a cycle where he would hook up with girls, get attached, he would lose interest get bored of them, and cut them off. He acknowledged he had hurt people in the past and that he didn't want to do it to me. Immediately, I knew avoidant attachment.

I pursued to ask him what his thoughts were on us and it took him a moment before he answered when he did he said it wouldn't work out because of how broken we both were. (Disclaimer: I talked about my struggle with my anxiety). He was very good at holding eye contact, so for him to say if I didn't want to talk to him anymore he said he understood and looked away when he said that .. it was salt in the wound for him to say that. I told him that I couldn't do that because we just shared a moment where we were vulnerable with each other.

The next day at the gym (we both work out at the same gym), he came up to me and we started to have a flirty banter. It almost seemed like our conversation from the day before never happened and it made me question if it even ended.. It gave me some hope and I was going to offer him a proposition to see if we make it work but, set firm boundaries between us. 

Days passed when I didn't see him and today I finally saw him. He gave me a weak wave and kept on pushing. He didn't bother to stop by and make conversation with me like he usually did. The coldest thing he's done to me since we started talking. 

I know who I am and where I stand, I've been doing work on myself so I was the best version of myself for him, and the fact that cold shoulder he gave me, really hurt me down to my core. But I don't know how to handle him since we both work out at the same gym and we both work there. I refuse to give him another flirty banter after what he did. I'm trying to find some clarity in all of this, and I know it's not me it's him at the end.",1,1742577450.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

## Why Choose a Saucepan (or Cezve!) for Turkish Coffee?

Before⁣ we‍ dive into the reviews, let's understand why a dedicated **turkish coffee saucepan** is essential for authentic brewing.

*   **Control Over Heat:** Turkish coffee ‍requires precise temperature control. A smaller saucepan allows⁤ for even heat distribution, preventing scorching and ensuring a smooth, consistent brew. This is crucial whether you are using a **gas stove cezve** or an **induction ⁣cezve**.
*  ⁣ **Ideal Size:** Traditional Turkish coffee is served in small **demitasse cups**,which means the pot or saucepan used ⁢needs to⁤ be ‌appropriately ⁤sized. A standard saucepan is often too large, making it ⁣arduous to achieve the right⁢ concentration and froth.
*   **Enhanced Flavor:** The shape and material of the saucepan can impact the ⁤flavor of the ​coffee. Certain materials, like **copper cezve**, are known for their excellent heat ⁤conductivity, resulting in ⁣a richer, ​more nuanced ‍taste.

## What to Consider When Buying a Turkish Coffee Saucepan

Choosing the ‌right **turkish coffee pot for sale** (or really, a saucepan that can act like one) involves careful consideration of several factors. Here's what to keep in mind:

### 1. Material: The Foundation of Flavor

The material of your **cezve**‍ or saucepan directly affects heat distribution and flavor. Common options include:

*   **Copper:** A classic choice,⁤ **copper ⁤cezve**‍ are prized⁤ for ‌their extraordinary heat ⁤conductivity.This allows for even heating and prevents hot spots, resulting in⁣ a smoother, more flavorful brew. Pure copper requires tin‍ lining for‌ food safety.
*  ‍ **Stainless Steel:** durable and easy‍ to clean, **stainless steel ⁤cezve** are a practical choice for everyday use. While stainless steel ​doesn't conduct heat as well as copper, it's still a ⁤reliable option. Look for⁣ models with a thick base for better heat distribution.
*   **Brass:** ⁣Similar to copper, **brass cezve**⁤ offer good heat conductivity. They often have a gorgeous,traditional aesthetic.‍ Like copper, often lined with other ​materials.*   **Enameled:** Some saucepans feature an enameled coating over a metal core. this adds durability and prevents the coffee⁤ from ⁢interacting directly with ‌the metal. **Enameled cezve** can be a good option, but check the quality of⁤ the enamel to ensure it's chip-resistant.

### 2. Size: Perfect Portions

The ideal size‌ for a **turkish coffee saucepan** depends on ​how many servings you typically make. A smaller saucepan (around 8-12 ounces) is perfect for single servings ⁢or dual ⁣servings. For larger groups, consider a slightly larger option.

### 3.Handle: Comfort‍ and Safety

A comfortable‌ and **heat resistant handle** is essential for safe and easy pouring, especially‌ when it comes from handling very hot liquids. Look for handles made from wood,silicone,or heat-resistant plastic.Ensure the handle is securely attached to the saucepan.

### 4. Pouring Spout: Precision Pouring

A well-designed **pouring ‍spout** allows for precise and​ controlled pouring, minimizing ⁢spills and ensuring you can evenly‍ distribute the coffee into​ your **demitasse cups**. Look for a spout that is smooth and tapered.

### 5. Compatibility: Stovetop Considerations

Consider the type of stovetop you have.Most saucepans are compatible with gas and ⁣electric stoves. However,if you have⁣ an induction ​cooktop,make‌ sure the saucepan is specifically designed for **induction cezve** ⁢use. An **electric cezve** exists as an alternative way to avoid this⁤ consideration. Some brewers prefer a **sand coffee** approach which requires⁤ specialty equipment.### 6. Durability: Built to Last

Choose⁢ a saucepan made from high-quality materials that are​ built to withstand frequent use. Look for sturdy construction⁣ and durable finishes. Read reviews to get an idea of the saucepan's longevity.

## How to Brew ⁤Authentic Turkish Coffee⁣ with a Saucepan

Now that you've chosen your **turkish coffee saucepan**, let's learn how to brew⁤ the ⁤perfect cup⁣ of **eastern⁤ coffee**.

Here's a step-by-step⁣ guide:

1.**gather Your Ingredients:** You'll need finely ground Turkish coffee (finer than espresso),cold water,and sugar (optional). A very fine grind is crucial.
2.**Measure Your⁢ Water:** Use a **demitasse cup** to measure ​the amount of water needed. Typically, you'll use one cup of ‍water per serving.
3.**Combine Ingredients:** add the water, coffee (about 1-2 teaspoons per cup), and sugar (if desired)​ to your **turkish coffee saucepan**.
4.**Stir‍ Well:** Stir the ingredients thoroughly until the coffee and sugar are dissolved.
5. ‍ **Heat and Simmer:** Place the⁣ saucepan over low heat. Avoid⁣ stirring after this point, as it ⁤can disrupt the formation ⁣of the crema.Let the coffee slowly heat up.
6.  **Watch for the Crema:** as the coffee ⁣heats, a dark foam ⁤(crema) will begin to form on the surface. This is a crucial element of Turkish coffee.
7.⁢  ⁤**Remove from Heat:** Just before the coffee boils over, remove the ⁢saucepan from ‍the heat.⁢ This step is crucial to prevent the coffee from losing its crema and becoming bitter.
8.  **Repeat (Optional):** For a richer, ⁤more flavorful coffee, you can repeat the heating⁢ and cooling process⁣ 2-3 ⁤times.
9.  **Pour and Serve:** Gently pour ‍the coffee into your **demitasse cups**, being careful to distribute the crema evenly.
10.‍ **Let Settle:**‍ Allow the coffee ⁣grounds ⁣to settle to the ‍bottom of the cup for a few minutes before serving. This is similar⁤ throughout many​ variations​ of this coffee; some ‍of the names ⁢might potentially be slightly different (**ottoman coffee, traditional coffee**).
11. **Enjoy:** Savor the rich, intense flavor of your authentic Turkish coffee!

*   **Use Freshly Ground coffee:** For the best flavor,grind‌ your coffee beans just before⁣ brewing.
*   **Use Filtered ‌water:** Filtered water will help to ensure a clean, pure​ taste.
*   **Use Low Heat:** ‍Low heat is essential‌ for even heating and preventing⁣ scorching.
*   **Don't boil:** avoid ‍letting the coffee boil over, as ‌this can make it bitter.
*   **Experiment with​ Sugar:** Adjust the⁣ amount of sugar to your‌ personal‍ preference.
*   **Serve with Water:** It's customary to serve Turkish coffee⁤ with a glass of water to cleanse the palate.

1jglujr,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1jglujr/i_lowkey_hate_my_bf/,I lowkey hate my bf,"Me (25F) and my (28M) bf are living in together for 2 years now. Wala syang bisyo, work and bahay lang talaga. This means, wala din syang friends. Meron sa work, oo, pero not on a deeper level like mine na literally has a circle, people I know and trust ever since I was in elementary.

Nung initial stages namin as bf/gf, issue na sa kanya yung paglabas-labas ko with my friends na technically ay family na. Also note na majority of them are my cousins sa father's side (grew up together at nagkakasama sa mga family reunions, Christmas parties). Sometimes with my sister pa nga. Yes, I am outgoing and adventurous. I told him about this nung bago pa lang kami. He is aware that my friends are a huge part of my life. They make me happy and complete as an individual. I admit, we've shared our kalokohan, even vices, throughout the years we have all been together. We drank and smoked during our younger years. Syempre, pa-cool akala mo talaga. As we matured, we became more career-focused, but we're still the same old people, tawanan, minsan nag-iinuman, at nagro-road trip sa gabi. Most of the time, ginagabi ng uwi just to make chika & drink coffee. I love going out, and I love being SPONTANEOUS. When I say this I mean, hanging out and driving at night, laughing, eating outside, etc.

In contrast, sya ay behave lang, umikot na sa trabaho ang buhay nya since he graduated college. (Both po kaming working, WFH ako). Even sa day off nya halos all about work lang ang usapan namin. He's the one who's always ranting about shit going on sa workplace nya. As a partner, of course it's my responsibility to I listen and understand. I do not share anything stressful about my work, I want to talk about things that touch the emotions though. About dreams, childhood, etc. I share my family problems with him. All of it. Siguro nasistress din sya about my family problems as much as I am stressed about his job, that is why I don't complain.

May mga bagay din na hindi kami pareho ng perspective, like:

1. Iba ang fashion choices nya sa akin. I like trendy outfits, whereas he wears whatever he thinks will do. This I do not mind, because to each their own, however

2. I discovered magkaiba din kami ng political beliefs. 

He hates researching, AND READING. I always remind him to read, read, read if and when he can. Even yung mga nakapost sa socmed, check if fake news or not. Especially those things that tackle politics. Minsan tuloy natatarayan ko sya kasi nakakapagod ang paulit ulit na magsabi about sa isang bagay when in fact kaya mo naman i-search, like mga how-to's, meaning ng isang word, etc. Nakakadagdag minsan sa mental load ko kapag ang daming tanong, especially about some things na parang kaya naman madaan sa google, self help ba...

However, I have no right complain about this kasi, siya naman, hindi napapagod everytime he does our laundry and cooks. I admit I am not a very good cook. And when our relationship started, he made it clear and insisted that he's gonna be the one in charge of all our laundry. He told me, ""ayaw nya akong mahirapan maglaba.""

I just wash our few dishes sometimes and walis walis. Ganun.

3. When asked about his opinion on divorce, he basically told me ""may other options naman other than divorce."" I asked, ""kahit binubugbog ka na, or sexually abusive sayo, no divorce pa rin?"" He said jail is an option.

4. At the early stages of our relationship, I mentioned na it's better for us to have our own bank accounts then have another one to put money for shared expenses. He doesn't agree with this. He believes that ""transparency"" is the key.

Because of this, I found it hard to surprise him with a gift during special occasions, birthdays, anniversaries... Because our salaries are joined. I even got to a point where I had to hide my previous personal debts I acquired even before we became together, because I was ashamed to admit that I am paying for something outside of our expenses, for myself. I thought, nakakahiya kung madamay pa sya. Eh 'nung single ako, sige, shopping, check out, etc.

There also was a time na nagsinungaling ako about where some money went. In my head, gusto ko kasi bumili ng mga things na walang nausisa. I admit, this is because hindi ako sanay na may kahati sa expenses, let alone imonitor ang pera with another person aside from me.

5. He got so jealous that one time he saw me talking and laughing with another older male supplier (I worked in events before). He got so mad. Almost felt like pinagbibintangan nya ako of cheating on him. Well, that's just me being friendly and polite. My family and friends can testify to that. Never in my life have I had any history of cheating.

For context, he had been cheated on by his ex-girlfriend before I came into the picture. Maybe it's his trauma (Though I told him it's not my job to heal him).

6. When we fight, tumataas boses nya. Oftentimes, he gets defensive. Napapansin ko, palagi syang may rebuttal sa kada statement na binabato ko sa kanya kapag magkaaway kami, like ""Eh ikaw nga eh...""

7. He questioned/questions my going home late at night. Sometimes, on my days off, I would go out with friends. During these times, he has work (hindi same ang rest days namin) and syempre me being alone sa apartment, I get sad and bored. I want to go out, chat or eat, anything to make the most out of my day. And him being not around (sometimes, overtime pa sa work), I won't wait for him to come home and do my thing na. When I come home, 90% out of 100%, magaaway kami. His reason would be ""Hindi gawain ng babae yan"" or ""May nagaalala sayo, bakit kailangan ginagabi"". I always update him about my whereabouts, and send pictures of places we are in. In my head, hello I'm with my bestfriends/cousins?

I remember a few times I lied about my location, dahil I had anxiety knowing na he'd get angry at me regardless kung 

I have no right nor expertise to psycho analyze, but sometimes I think maybe the reason why he is the way he is was because of the things he experienced during his childhood. Idk, neglect ba? I ask myself, why does he have too much trust issues?

For context, he has very strict parents (especially his father). Did not let him go out to play basketball, etc. He told me he doesn't have a ""solid circle of friends"" and growing up, all he had was those ""just friends"" type of friends. The ones you've had a great time with but didn't establish a connection with.

Also, maybe the reason why I get so avoidant is because I grew up without support. I cannot communicate my feelings well. And it sucks.

'Di ko maalis sa isip ko na through time, I actually, silently labeled him as ""the guy who is insecure"".

Deep down, I know he is a very good and sweet guy. Responsible and maalaga. No signs of cheating, too (AFAIK). He is sweet, and makes sure I am fed everyday.

But sometimes I look at him as someone na ""mababaw"" as a person. Why? Kasi minsan gusto ko mag-engage sa deep talk, and then I feel like, hindi ko pa nga nacocommunicate yung deepest feelings ko, nag-iba na agad yung topic. Or minsan, yung mga responses nya ay hindi ""swak"" sa depth na gusto ko marinig mula sa isang tao.

Personal story behind this question: My therapist asked me a few weeks ago how I am finding motivation through all of this, and I still don't have any good answers. I originally planned to work throughout spring break but took a few days off after a really demoralizing grading session. I burned out from this semester a little too quickly because I worked overtime to address what seemed to be their gaps in knowledge and skills only to find out that that's only half the problem; the other half is that so many students are literally sitting around doing nothing for the class. I operated on the assumption that they needed compassion first (especially in the current moment with the FAFSA freeze etc.) only to find out that the majority of my students are actually really only motivated by the threat of punishment (so I'm going to take a more punitive pedagogical approach for the rest of the semester lol it's contrary to my training but I'll do what it takes to survive and conserve my own energy).

Right now, I don't know what saddens me the most: students who are clearly trying their best but lack basic skills (like keeping track of course materials, checking emails, taking notes, comprehending what they are reading) or students who not only don't try but expect me to compensate for their lack of effort and raise their grade if they complain (and/or gaslight me into thinking I didn't explain something clearly so they were too confused to do the assignment).

Sometimes I feel like I am almost having an existential crisis because it hits me that I spend my full-time job doing something futile, like building someone's fancy custom home on sand because they want it to be located by the beach (an imperfect metaphor for the situation but it's the first thing that came to mind re: futility lol). The work is never-ending to begin with (academia problems in general but also composition teachers: you know the struggle), so any time I take off to rest and recuperate just puts me further behind in grading & providing feedback on the writing of 90 students. The work and the stress are piling up, and it's hard to see the point of it all.

The only thing keeping me going at work right now, other than strategic doses of caffeine (just sat down at a coffee shop), is that I ordered a bucketload of stickers and stick them in my sticker book (thank you Gen Z for bringing back sticker books) every time I finish a grading task. So far, it's a way to feel like I am making some kind of progress because even if students read none of my feedback (again) or complain about their grade later, at least I succeeded in filling another page with cute stickers.",9,1742576469.0,Professors,6,0.85,False

Started Ozempic Nov 15, 2024 - 18 weeks ago -- down 31.7 lbs and 4"" on my waist

In 2021, during pandemic lockdowns, I found out I had a rare cancer. A producing tumour that was pumping out testosterone, cortisol and 2 other hormones I don't remember, and I was gaining 8 lbs a month, even if I exercised for 1.5 hours a day, even if I ate only 600 calories a day, and I was hungry all the time.

I gained weight so fast. So so fast, I'm shocked my heart could take it. I got up to 247.2 lbs at my highest weight, but I don't think I logged it anywhere because I felt so awful about it. 

The cancer I had isn't treatable by chemo or radiation. It was surgery or nothing, so I did the surgery and I was insanely lucky. They got it all out. It didn't burst. That was the risk - that if it burst, the non-treatable cancer would be everywhere. I had good surgeons. They saved my life, and I've been cancer free since - and in post-surgical menopause overnight. 

I fought my way down to from 247.2 to 220 lbs over about 6 months eating only whole foods and walking. Then I fell off track, regained about 12 lbs, and that's when I finally got referred to an obesity specialist, and she has helped me so much. What an amazing doctor! 

I do literally everything she says. I'm sleeping more, drinking only water and coffee, I lift weights 3 times a week (as heavy as I can), and walk for 1 hour 4 times a week or more. I'm on a very low dose of Ozempic because that's effective for me, and I'm losing on average 1.7 lbs a week. 

I'm about halfway to my goal of 160 lbs and I feel amazing! 

And today, I'm in onederland. I can't believe it. I'm 199.6 lbs! It really doesn't feel real lol

Ozempic and this reddit community have changed my life. I feel healthy. I can do so many things i couldn't do before. I can climb 5 flights of stairs before I'm winded. I can keep up with my 20-something kids. 

I've been able to turn my cpap pressure down from 12.0 to 7.2. I think I can actually drop lower, but I'm taking it slow. I no longer have NAFLD. My A1C and glucose fasting levels are so much better, I clearly have less insulin resistance, and I wake up with so much energy I *want* to exercise and dance and run and play. Me. The world's most sedentary human. It's shocking. And amazing.

I'm not brave enough to post progress pictures. I'm still obese and I have a terrible body image. I can't really see the changes in the pictures anyhow. 

Very grateful to all of you for answering my questions when I started Oz and being there when I felt  frustrated or hopeless, and especially thankful for my weight-loss buddy u/sw-1979 who has made this journey fun 💜 ",68,1742576312.0,Ozempic,16,1.0,False

That is when I found out that all black edition Huel contains green tea and kombucha. 

Being sensitive to caffeine due to anxiety or other health issues is a big deal and Huel should be more cautious with this type of labeling.

Yes I am aware it is sugar but 5 little carbs? Shot me up 40 points (I manage prediabetes and hypoglycemia med free and with a low carb diet for years now)and then, even though I ate- almond flour pancake, guacamole and scrambled eggs- I still dropped shortly after. I dropped 60 points an hour later. I am wearing a dexcom right now to just get an idea without finger pricks because I was so sick of doing that. So I saw where I was headed.

I had eaten about 4 hours earlier as well, I ate a 5 mg edible tohelp me sleep and also some PLAIN NO sugar greek yogurt (which also raises my blood sugar a bit and I dont think it used to)- and peanut butter.

Normally with food I am okay with a cup of coffee in the morning. It was probably the sugar in the creamer but ffs all that dramam over 5 little carbs.

And even without any creamer but half and half- it seems like if I over do it with coffee throughout the day, even if I eat- I can still drop lower.

Anyone else see caffeine causing lows even if you eat?

Anyone else seeing increased sensitivity to sugar? I rarely indulge but this has me worried. That was a big reaction for so little sugar.

My Crohn’s started off absolutely terribly right from the start, needing my ileum and cecum removed within months of my first diagnosis.

Since then, I would say it has been “mild” and I’ve been able to live a relatively normal life just taking Pentasa and avoiding triggers like caffeine. 

However, my most recent colonoscopy and stool samples still show inflammation of the small bowel, with calprotectin levels elevated compared to before. Some of this I blame to having coffee and getting instant flares. 

Anyway, my PA is recommending I go to Humira or Remicade as she doesn’t want the inflammation to go untreated or worsen. 

I’m leaning towards going on Humira, knowing the very slight risks regarding Lymphoma since I’m worried about the long-term risks of leaving the inflammation as is.

[\[FIRST PART\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1igcll6/there_is_a_weird_guest_in_my_hotel_and_i_need_to/)

Hi guys, I just wanted to start this post off by saying thank you for the comments on the last one. I really thought I might have been over exaggerating how weird this guy was. I told my sister about it yesterday as well once she got home and she didn’t think it should have freaked me out as much as it did. She said, “if the worst that happened was a bad phone call, then I think your day went pretty fine OP.” But reading all of your responses being equally weirded out by the guy made me feel a bit less crazy. I mean, today has been... a day. Kind of starting to feel crazy again, but you know, I’ll get into it.

As for if my manager ever updated me on anything the guy did yesterday… No? I mean she did text me about him today, but I’ll talk about that in a second. So I guess after I checked him into his room, he just stayed there all day. 

We have a passdown system here, so basically we have a log where we put all our notes for the day, including things like strange behaviors from guests. Usually it looks something like this:

**\[ROOM NUMBER\] - guest had issues using the shower. Work order entered.** 

Or:

**Cops were called on lady in lobby, lady did not have a reservation and refused to leave. She is trespassed, if she shows up again, call cops. \[DESCRIPTION OF GUEST\].**

I think you get the idea. They are usually pretty short and sweet. There really isn’t a need to gum it up with information that doesn’t really matter. I was reading the passdowns from our overnight girl this morning though and it was a bit longer than her usual entries. I copied it here for you guys (a bit redacted, sorry, privacy policy stuff):

**\[ROOM NUMBER\] - Mr. \[GUEST LAST NAME\] was in the lobby for a while last night. I asked if he needed help for anything but he said he was fine. I asked for his room number to make sure he was staying with us (he is). Called \[SECURITY GUARDS NAME\] and asked him to stand up at the desk with me. Mr. \[GUEST LAST NAME\] went back to his room once \[SECURITY GUARD\] got here. Got a call from his room too, but I think his phone is broken. (\[OP\], can you have \[MAINTENANCE\] check it out in the morning?).** 

I read it after she clocked out so I wasn’t able to ask her more about the phone thing, like if she felt the weird breathing thing that I did yesterday. 

There weren’t any other notes about him in our passdowns, but one of my housekeeping girls today did text me saying that when she went to give him room service he was really weird. The thing about that is, the room has to be vacated for someone to do housekeeping. It's a safety policy thing. It’s been a while since I’ve read it, but basically it’s for the safety of our housekeepers. Well, Mr. Weird was in the room while she was cleaning. 

I’ll copy our texts here so you can see what she had to deal with. (Also, sorry but another note here. She doesn’t speak English, and I don’t speak Spanish, so our texts back and forth can read a little weird. We are just doing rounds of google translate to the other person's language and it doesn’t always go well.)

\[Housekeeper\] - Our guest in \[ROOM NUMBER\] is strange.

\[Me\]                 - Yes! I noticed yesterday at check in! How did he behave with you?

\[Housekeeper\] - He is standing in the room as I cleaned. He watched me as I cleaned.

\[Me\]                 - Ew! I’m so sorry! \[long apology about the situation\] He didn’t do anything else 

though? Just looked?

\[Housekeeper\] - He only looked as I cleaned. 

\[Me\]                 - I’m so sorry. 

\[Housekeeper\] - It is okay! I won’t enter that room again.

Then a bit of time passed, maybe 5 minutes?

\[Housekeeper\] - Can I tell you something about \[ROOM NUMBER\]? 

\[Me\]                 - Yes

\[Housekeeper\] - I left his room and I hear him talking. He sounds behind me. 

\[Me\]                 - He sounds like he is standing behind you?

\[Housekeeper\] - yes

\[Me\]                 - Do not go near his room again. 

\[Housekeeper\] - ok

I’m pretty sure she got an early lunch, and my housekeeping manager came down to talk to me about it. I told her what I knew, which isn’t a lot. That, apparently, he had requested housekeeping (but I really can’t find any notes about this literally anywhere), she had gone to the room and entered, then texted me that he was in the room when she was cleaning. I want to double down that the housekeeper that went in is 100% not the type to do that. All the housekeepers know not to go in the room if someone is in there, but her especially. So now I’m thinking, like, what did he say or do to get her in the room? 

The housekeeping manager said something about going up to tell him we would not be cleaning the room if he was in it, but he’s set to check out tomorrow so it shouldn’t be a big deal. I just told her we shouldn’t send anyone up to that room alone, but she thinks I’m being a bit dramatic about it. But I never got a message from her saying she went up there to tell him anything so maybe she decided against it. 

So about my manager's text. She sent it to me like halfway through my shift (it was actually during my lunch break), and it’s not all that weird on its own but, you know. In addition to everything else, it's pretty weird. She texted me and asked if he’d called the desk again. And obviously I was confused because she didn’t have anything in her notes about him being weird and calling the desk. I’ll copy these messages as well for you:

\[Manager\] - Did \[ROOM NUMBER\] call the desk again today?

\[Me\]          - Not yet. Why?

\[Manager\] - He kept calling last night, and I know he called during \[OVERNIGHT GIRL\]’s shift 

too. 

\[Me\]          - Oh, well he hasn’t called again. 

\[Me\]          - Did he say anything weird?

\[Manager\] - On the phone?

\[Me\]          - Yeah

\[Manager\] - No, I think the phone in that room is broken.

\[Me\]          - Did he say anything on the phone?

\[Manager\] - No, I think it’s the phone in that room. We just need to go in and change it. I texted 

\[MAINTENANCE\] about it and he said he would check it out. 

\[Me\]          - I’m going to tell him not to enter the room if the guest is in there. \[GUEST NAME\] 

really creeped me out last night, and \[HOUSEKEEPER\] too this morning. 

\[Manager\] - Just let me know if \[MAINTENANCE\] can fix the phone when he’s done. Text me if 

anything weird happens. 

I mean guys, I don’t know but this phone thing is really bothering me. Like really really bothering me because I checked the call logs and he called the front desk like 32 times. It looked like twice an hour every hour from around 3pm ish till 6am ish. That is crazy right?? I’m not crazy for thinking that's crazy? No one tried to call back and tell him to stop? No one went up to the room to tell him to stop? Because there is no way that 32 times is an issue with the phone. I mean unless some techy person on here can tell me some super obscure way that causes phones to call one specific number over and over again like that. I don’t know, I feel like it's really weird. 

Anyway, this is the most exciting part. I’m sorry it took so long, these other things were just a bit too weird to not include them. I saw him again. 

So I was going back to the kitchen to refill the coffee, and it was like almost the end of my shift so I was sort of losing hope that I was going to see him today. So I fill the little coffee container, and walk back up to the desk, and turn the corner. Who do I see? Mr. Weird standing right in front of the coffee station.

He wasn’t making coffee or anything, just looking at it. So I walked up beside him and tried to talk to him. Kind of went something like this. 

“Hello Mr. \[LAST NAME\], do you mind moving over just a bit so I can set down some fresh coffee for you?”

“Fresh?” Which is the first question I’ve heard him ask. Yesterday when he came to make the reservation to begin with he just said ‘I need a room’ or something like that. I don’t know, maybe I’m reading into it too much. 

“Yes Mr. \[LAST NAME\]. I just roasted a new pot of coffee, so I just went to the back to refill it here.”

And this whole time I was trying to like, observe him without making it obvious. A couple of comments yesterday made me think that I should like, maybe try to see if there is something off about him, looks wise. 

So another baby interlude here, when you are behind the desk and helping someone out, it's hard to fully realize the scope of how tall someone is. There's just space between you, so it makes a height difference seem less intense. I don’t know the science or psychology behind it, just know that's how it feels.

So I walk up to the guy, try to get him to scooch over while also trying to see if he looks ‘off’ somehow, and suddenly I notice that he’s like Really Tall. I’m not that short either. I mean, I’m only 5’8 but this guy is dwarfing me. Not like, “he’s 6ft omg!” but like, “This is freakishly tall and I have no idea how I didn’t notice yesterday” kind of tall. I don’t think it helps that he was standing so straight, like he had a rod up his back or something. It was freaky. 

And then, he looked at me, which he was not doing before and I fucking felt his eyes in my skin again. I’m sorry, I tried to keep cursing out of the post, mostly because it’s not really necessary but oh my god. I swear, I could feel his eyes in my skin. 

I… I really don’t know what else to say. I don’t know how to describe it. He was just… Looking At Me. Staring at me. I really don’t even have words close enough for how it felt when he looked at me. I felt so bad, did my housekeeper feel like this? Like, guys, did I somehow, inadvertently, send my poor housekeeper into this fucking guy’s room???? Because this staring is just… it feels awful. I feel awful. Like sick or something I don’t know. Like when you are so anxious you start to feel sick, even if nothing is really happening. That’s kind of, a little bit like what being watched by this guy felt like. Sort of. 

The really unfortunate thing is that his… fucking staring, god christ it was awful, sort of distracted me from trying to notice much else about him. I know I had mentioned in one comment that I would try to see if he looked as normal as I remember him and I really couldn’t tell you. I kind of felt… frozen. Or maybe more, paused? Like I couldn’t get myself to move. I don’t know. It’s really hard to describe. Maybe it’s just fight or flight (or freeze). 

Anyway, he stopped looking at me eventually. I set up the coffee for him, and like, apologized for staring (I kind of was staring at him), then went to hide in the back office. 

Saying I was recovering from him staring at me sounds a little stupid, but hey that's what I was doing. So I sat in the back and watched on the camera monitor. I’ll do that sometimes if I’m really not in the mood to be at the desk or if it's really slow. 

Well anyway, there he was on the camera. Standing in front of the coffee station, the funny thing is, he did not look as tall as he felt. He looked tall but not freakishly tall. Maybe my anxiety was warping the height in my brain or something. 

There really isn’t much more to tell you from there that isn’t the same as yesterday. I was looking at the camera, there was some camera fuzz, I looked under the desk to try and see if something wasn’t plugged in properly, and by the time I looked up, the guy was gone. The coffee station was messed up too. Like, coffee all over the table, coffee cups half filled, sugar packets kind of, everywhere. A huge mess that I had to clean in the last like, 30 minutes of my shift. So that’s cool. 

I looked back in the camera recordings again for when he was in the lobby before I hid in the back. It sort of just looked like we were having a staring contest when he was looking at me. He didn’t… move or anything. I kinda didn’t either. Looking at it from that perspective kind of tripped me out, I don’t know. On the camera it sort of looks pretty normal. Apart from having a staring contest. 

I didn’t tell my manager about it, I just wanted to get home and type this all up so I can get it off my chest. I also told the agent following me to text me if literally anything weird happened with him. Anything at all. Hopefully he doesn’t freak her out. 

Also a couple of notes for some of the comments. 

1. The only thing reported missing was a set of car keys that ended up being found later in the guest's room. I also didn’t notice anything missing from the desk, and housekeeping didn’t mention anything missing either. 
2. The only other ‘disappearing act’ situation that happened with him today (so far) was him being in the lobby and then being gone, but that could have been the camera malfunctioning, and also I was away from the desk to fill the coffee containers so he could have just walked up like normal.
3. I haven’t rewatched the ‘men in black’ episode of unsolved mysteries/buzzfeed unsolved yet. Felt like just coming home, changing into pajamas, and watching tiktoks in bed for a bit. 

Again, if any other front desk agents or anyone has dealt with this guy or someone like him, some help or advice would be really appreciated. He should be checking out tomorrow so I will update you if anything happens at that time. Hopefully not though.

Any advice is welcome, but I am very pessimistic since it feels like I've tried most things.

I'm currently pregnant with my second child, 29 weeks.

My last pregnancy was fairly easy, with the only issue being pelvic girdle pain to the point where I needed crutches. I was 22 years old.

This time I'm 27 years old, same weight but way more active from working, going to uni and caring for a 4yo.
Everything feels horrible. I already feel a bond and love this baby almost as much as my 4yo, but I hate being pregnant with my entire being right now.

- The pelvic girdle pain is horrible, with it being centered in my lower back this time. I can't bend down, I can't carry or lift anything. I walk very slow and with lots of effort. I still have to study and do my internship tho, because we won't be able to pay rent otherwise.
Now my hips hurt too from straining them too much, causing me to sleep horribly from pain.

- I'm borderline anemic, and I can tell. I've never had anemia. This is the first time. I don't remember the units, but the limit for being anemic is 100 and I'm at 105. The supplements aren't raising the numbers although I do everything recommended. I take the fancy, expensive ones with the best uptake, I take it in the late evening 2 hours after dinner and then I go to bed. I even have an alarm to wake me up to take it in case I fall asleep. I avoid magnesium, coffee and tea, but can't avoid a high fiber diet due to IBS. I can't stop taking omeprazole because the heartburn is too extreme and makes me vomit straight acid, but I take it in the morning.
I'm out of breath from turning over in bed, walking slowly across the house, getting up from a chair etc. I'm so tired... it might be me overthinking, but I think I look pale.

- I cant drink much. Its super frustrating because I can only drink very small amounts at a time or I get nauseous, probably from the lack of space for my stomach. So ofc, on top of everything else, I'm dehydrated and feel like I can't do much about it without becoming nauseous. I was already bad at drinking before pregnancy.


I'm extremely tired of pregnancy. I no longer feel joy from this. Not even from feeling my little baby move around. I just want these last 10 weeks to fly by so I can have my baby. All I think about is how uncomfortable and in pain I am and how much work my husband has to do since I can't do basically anything. I see that he is tired. He never complains, because he knows I do more than my midwife recommends I do, but I know he thinks this sucks too.

All sugar makes me just crave more, and I feel like this is true more for some sugar-free alternatives than others (black coffee with just sugar free syrup makes me so hungry, but with a splash of light cream helps so much. I’ll ask about coffee on appetite in another post). I just struggle to detect which additive truly impact my hunger signals vs which are the reliable choices when it comes to sugar-free or sweetener options (because no, unfortunately realistically I cannot cut out sweets altogether forever).

I loved the idea of decaf but any time I tried to brew decaf in my Switch, it would come out completely terrible. I'm not a coffee snob but the stuff I made was completely undrinkable and tasted like watered-down dirt, even with expensive beans.

I finally decided to try one last bag of beans before giving up on decaf completely and ordered the Perc decaf. I just brewed my first batch now using the Coffee Chronicler method, Switch, K6 grinder and it's delicious. This is the first decaf I've made where I can't taste any difference between this and caffeinated stuff.

I know this sounds like an astroturfing post but I have no affiliation with them, just wanted to pass this along for anyone who had given up on their quest to find a drinkable decaf.",22,1742575377.0,pourover,20,1.0,False

Manufacturing is chaos on repeat. One month it’s “MANDATORY OVERTIME OR ELSE,” and the next, you’re perfecting the ancient art of broom-pushing because there’s nothing to build but you still have to “look busy.”

The setup? Classic corporate pyramid scheme. Owner at the top raking it in, management layers below, then us—the people who actually make the product that pays everyone's salary.

Here’s where it gets downright absurd:
When things slow down, it’s us—the lowest-paid, hardest-working folks—who get stuck doing busywork to “justify” our jobs. Cleaning stuff that doesn’t need cleaning. Inventing tasks out of thin air. Meanwhile, the higher-ups? Meetings, coffee, LinkedIn browsing, and pretending Outlook is hard to use.

So let me get this straight:
The people who physically create the thing your company sells… have to “find stuff to do,” while the folks collecting bigger paychecks for PowerPoint decks and vague “strategy” sit comfortably doing next to nothing?

How is this still the norm? How is everyone not screaming from the rooftops?

Corporate logic: Where those who do the least get paid the most, and those who do the most get to “look busy.”

Or ​perhaps you're a café owner serving discerning customers ⁤who appreciate the nuanced notes only a Chemex brew can unlock? Whether you're a seasoned home barista or ‌a busy professional, you know‌ that the heart​ of the Chemex experience lies in its‌ filters. ⁣This comprehensive guide delves‌ deep into the⁢ world of​ Chemex ⁤coffee filters, exploring everything from ⁢the classic ⁢options to‍ the best alternatives available in 2025. We'll cover everything‍ you need to⁢ know,​ from the different types of‌ Chemex paper filters to finding​ the best ​price‍ on‍ your next purchase.

## Understanding​ the Importance ⁣of Chemex ‍Coffee Filters

The ​Chemex coffeemaker, with its distinctive hourglass shape and pour-over brewing method, is ​more than just a coffee maker; ⁣it's a design icon.However, the magic truly happens⁤ when ⁢paired with​ the right filter. ⁢Chemex coffee filters aren't just⁣ any filter paper for⁢ Chemex; they are specially⁣ designed to provide a ⁤unique brewing experience. Let’s understand why.

**The Role of Filter Paper ​for Chemex**

*   **Purity ​of ⁣Flavor:** Chemex filters excel at removing impurities, ⁢oils, and sediments⁢ that can detract ⁤from the coffee's true character. This results in a ​remarkably clean and shining cup, highlighting the subtle nuances of ​your favorite beans. Many users report enhanced ⁢clarity when using the Chemex brewing process, a testament to the‌ filters' effectiveness.
*   **Optimal Flow⁢ Rate:** The thickness‌ and fiber ⁤structure ⁢of Chemex filters are engineered to provide the ideal flow ‍rate for extraction. This controlled flow​ allows for a​ balanced brew, preventing both under-extraction (sour,⁢ weak coffee) and over-extraction (bitter, ⁤astringent‍ coffee).
*   **Superior Filtration:** Compared to⁢ metal filters or other ‍pour-over methods, ​Chemex filters ⁤arguably ‌offer the most comprehensive filtration. They trap even the finest particles, resulting in a smooth, sediment-free cup of coffee.
*   **The Chemex Taste Filter:** In the specialty coffee world, the discussion⁤ around‍ taste is ⁣very common. The Chemex filter​ is designed ⁤to not impart ‍any⁢ flavors into the coffee, which results ⁤in an extremely clean ⁣cup of ⁢coffee.

**Who This ⁤guide is For**

This guide is ​specifically tailored to three ⁤key audiences:

*⁣   **Coffee Enthusiasts/Home Baristas:**⁣ You're‍ passionate ‍about brewing high-quality coffee at ⁤home and​ appreciate the chemex's ‍unique brewing method. You're looking for⁤ the best chemex ⁢filters‌ and maybe the alternatives.
*   **Coffee Shops/Cafes:** You⁣ use Chemex ⁤brewers⁤ in ⁣your ⁣commercial establishment and need reliable access to high-quality filters at competitive prices. You ‌might be looking for Chemex filter bulk options.
*   **Chemex Brewer Owners:** You already own a Chemex and need to replenish your filter supply,⁢ seeking convenience, trusted sources, and options‍ for filter type (bleached/unbleached).

[[Explore Top Rated chemex coffee filters on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/breville/?kw=chemex coffee filters)
## Chemex ⁢Filters: A Deep ‌Dive into the Options

Chemex offers ⁢a variety of filters to suit different preferences and needs. ⁣Understanding these ⁤options is crucial for selecting the⁣ right filter for your brewing setup.

**Types ‍of ⁤Chemex Filters:**

*   **Chemex Classic filters (Square):** These⁤ are the original and most iconic Chemex filter. They come ‌pre-folded⁢ and are designed to fit‌ all Chemex coffeemakers except the‍ CM-1, CM-1C, and CM-1GH models (which require⁤ a⁣ half-moon filter).
*   **Chemex ⁤Pre Folded Filters​ (Square):** These​ save you the ⁢step of folding and are often preferred⁤ for their convenience, which in turn speeds up ⁢use‍ of the Chemex⁤ method.
*   **Chemex Square Filters:** Can frequently enough meen the classic filters.
* ⁤  **Chemex‍ Unbleached Filters:**⁢ The natural ⁤choice for those seeking ‍an ‍eco-amiable option. Unbleached filters retain a slight paper taste initially, ‍often diminished by pre-rinsing with hot water.
*   **Chemex Bleached Filters:** ⁣These⁤ filters⁤ are treated with oxygen to achieve a​ bright white appearance. Some believe they offer a slightly cleaner‌ taste compared to ​unbleached filters, tho the ⁣difference is frequently enough ‍negligible.*   **Chemex Half-Moon Filters:** Designed specifically for the ⁣CM-1, CM-1C, and CM-1GH models, these filters are shaped to fit the smaller⁤ cone.

**Key Considerations ‌When⁢ Choosing Chemex Filters:**

*   ‍**Bleached vs. Unbleached:** As mentioned above, this⁤ choice comes down to personal preference and environmental concerns. Experiment to see which you prefer.
*   **Pre-folded vs. Unfolded:** Pre-folded filters⁢ offer convenience,⁣ while unfolded ⁤filters allow for some customization in folding technique​ (though most users⁢ stick to the standard‌ fold).
*  ⁤ **Size⁤ and Compatibility:** Ensure you choose the⁤ correct filter size for your⁤ specific Chemex model.Square​ filters are the standard for most brewers, while half-moon filters are reserved for ⁢the⁤ smaller models.[[Explore Top Rated chemex coffee filters on amazon.]](https://storeins.com/breville/?kw=chemex coffee filters)
## Finding the Best price: buying Chemex Filters

For both home baristas and coffee ‍shops, cost is a important factor.⁤ Here are strategies for ‍finding‌ the​ best price on Chemex filters:

* ⁤  **Compare‌ Prices Online:** ⁤Websites⁢ like Amazon,Target,and the official Chemex website frequently enough have varying prices ⁤and promotions. Utilizing price comparison‍ tools or manually ‍checking multiple retailers can reveal significant savings.
*   **Consider a‌ Chemex Filter Subscription:** Some retailers offer subscription⁢ services that provide regular filter deliveries at a discounted rate. This is a convenient option for frequent Chemex users.
* ‌  **Buy Chemex filter Bulk:** Purchasing in bulk is almost⁢ always⁤ more ⁢cost-effective, especially for​ coffee shops and high-volume home brewers. Look ‌for ‍bulk discounts from online retailers or restaurant‌ supply ⁢stores.
*   **Look for ‌Chemex Filter ⁤sale and Chemex​ Filter⁤ Discount opportunities:** Keep an eye⁢ out ​for seasonal sales, promotional offers, and discount codes. Subscribing to email newsletters from Chemex and its ​retailers can‍ provide ‍early⁤ access to these deals.
* ⁢  **Check for Chemex filter Alternatives (If Looking for Cheaper Options):** While official Chemex filters are highly regarded, exploring⁤ alternatives can save you money. We'll delve into this in more detail later.
*‌   ‍**Where to Buy Chemex Filters:** Buying directly from the chemexcoffeemaker.com always guarantees you are buying official chemex filters.

## Chemex Filter Alternatives: Exploring Your⁢ Options

While official Chemex filters are prized for their quality and ‍performance, several alternatives offer‌ comparable⁤ results at a ‍perhaps ​lower price point. These options can ‍be particularly ⁣appealing if you're looking to save money or⁢ prefer a more sustainable ‍approach.

**Factors ‌to Consider When Choosing Alternatives:**

*   **Filtration⁢ Quality:** The‌ primary function of a filter is to remove impurities and sediment. Look for alternatives that offer similar⁣ filtration capabilities to Chemex ‌filters.
*   **Flow‍ Rate:** ‍The filter should allow for a consistent and controlled flow rate, mimicking the performance of Chemex filters to ensure ‌proper extraction.
*  ⁢​ **Material⁢ and⁤ Taste:** The filter material shouldn't⁤ impart any unwanted flavors to your coffee. Opt for filters ⁢made from high-quality paper or other neutral materials.
*   **Size⁢ and ​Compatibility:** ⁣Ensure the choice filter is compatible with⁢ your Chemex brewer. Some filters may ⁣require slight modifications to ⁤fit properly.

**Popular ​Chemex‍ Filter Alternatives:**

*   **Other⁤ Brand​ Pour⁤ Over Filters:** ​Some brands offer filters that are similar in‌ construction to Chemex ​filters, ⁢which may ⁢work ​as coffee filters compatible with chemex.
*⁤   **Reusable‍ Cloth ⁣Filters:** ⁣These are a⁤ more sustainable option,as ‍they⁢ can be washed and reused​ multiple times. however, ‍they require more maintenance and may⁢ not offer the same level of filtration as ⁢paper filters.*   **Metal⁢ Filters:** While not⁣ a direct replacement ⁢for Chemex filters, ‌metal⁢ filters can be ‍used⁢ with a Chemex. However, they⁤ produce a ⁣different flavor profile, as ⁣they allow more ‌oils‍ and sediments to pass through.
* ⁤  **DIY Filter Paper​ for ⁢Chemex:** Some resourceful coffee enthusiasts create their own filters using laboratory-grade filter paper. This requires some experimentation and skill but can ⁣be a ‌cost-effective option.

While‍ exploring alternatives, keep in mind that the official Chemex filters⁢ are designed specifically⁢ for the Chemex brewer. ‌Using alternatives​ may require some adjustments to your brewing ⁣technique to achieve optimal results.

## ‌Mastering the Chemex Brewing Process with the Right⁣ Filter

The quality of ⁣your Chemex coffee filters ⁢is only one piece of ⁢the⁣ puzzle. Mastering​ the Chemex brewing process is equally crucial‌ for achieving ⁣a consistently appetizing cup.

**A Step-by-Step Guide to Using Chemex Filters:**

1.  **Prepare Your Filter:** If using ‌pre-folded filters, ⁢simply ⁢open them ​up and⁢ place them‌ in the​ Chemex brewer with the​ thicker, multi-layered side ⁤facing the spout.If using unfolded filters, follow these steps for pre-folded ⁤chemex filter tutorial:
    * ‍  ‌Fold the filter in half.*   Fold it in‌ half again.
  ⁣  * ⁢  Separate one of the⁤ points to create a cone shape, with three layers on one side⁤ and one layer on the other.
‍ ‌   * ​  Place the ⁣cone in ⁣the Chemex, ⁤with the three-layered ⁣side facing​ the spout.
2.  **Rinse the Filter:** pour hot‌ water​ over the filter to rinse away any paper residue and preheat the Chemex.This also helps the‍ filter adhere to the sides of the brewer. Discard the rinse water.
3.  ⁤**Add Coffee Grounds:** Grind your coffee beans to a medium-coarse consistency. Add the grounds to the filter. The amount of coffee ​will depend ⁤on your desired ​strength and the size of your ‍Chemex. A general guideline ​is 1-2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounces of water.
4.  **The ⁤Bloom:** This is a‍ crucial step in the Chemex brewing ⁢process.Pour a small amount of hot water (just off⁢ the​ boil) over ​the grounds, saturating them⁣ evenly. ‌Allow the coffee ​to ""bloom""⁤ for 30-45 seconds. ⁤This allows the coffee to degas and release trapped carbon dioxide, ​resulting in ‍a more flavorful brew.
5.  **Pour Slowly and Evenly:** After the bloom, slowly ⁢pour the remaining hot water over⁣ the grounds in⁢ a circular motion, ensuring even saturation. Maintain a steady​ flow rate,allowing the water ⁣to drip through the filter.
6.  **Monitor⁣ the Brew:** The entire brewing process should take around 3-4 minutes. Adjust your grind size or pouring technique if the⁤ brew is too fast or too slow.
7.  **Discard the Filter:** Once the brewing is ⁣complete, carefully​ remove the filter ​and discard it.
8.  **Enjoy Your Coffee:** Pour your ‍freshly brewed Chemex coffee and savor the clean,​ nuanced ⁣flavors.

**tips⁣ for Optimal‌ Brewing:**

*   **Use Freshly Roasted Coffee:** The fresher the⁣ coffee, ⁣the better the flavor.
*   **Grind Your Beans Just Before Brewing:** This preserves the volatile oils that‍ contribute to ⁢the coffee's ​aroma and flavor.*   **Use ⁤Filtered Water:** Clean, filtered ‍water ⁣is essential for a pure-tasting cup.
*  ⁢ **Experiment with Grind ⁢Size and⁣ Water​ Temperature:** ‍These factors⁣ can substantially impact ⁣the flavor‍ of ​your ‌coffee.
*   **Preheat Your Chemex:**‌ This helps maintain a consistent​ brewing temperature.[[Explore Top Rated chemex coffee filters on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/breville/?kw=chemex coffee filters)
## The Science⁢ Behind Chemex Filter Quality

The ⁤exceptional quality of Chemex coffee is not just as of the glass brewer’s design;⁢ the ⁣Chemex filter material ‌has a vital role. The ⁤unique filter paper ‍used in Chemex filters is thicker ⁢and denser than most other ⁤coffee filters. This increased thickness is what enables ‌the filter to remove the majority of oils and fine sediments that contribute to bitter flavors.

The Chemex coffeemaker filters are ​based on laboratory‍ grade paper and specifically designed to filter out impurities, unhealthy and bitter elements from​ the coffee. Chemex⁢ filters are 20-30% thicker than⁤ your ⁤average coffee filter, which is⁣ made possible ​by ‌the heavy weight bonding in the design.

**Chemex Filter Lifespan**

Chemex filters are designed for‌ single use only. Because of its filtration properties, it traps all the oils and sediments from the​ brewing process, and is not designed to​ be cleaned​ and reused.

**Chemex Filter Disposal**

Chemex filters, along with the coffee ​grounds, ⁤are fully compostable.

What do I do next?,"So, today I did something stupid out of panic and I don't know what action I need to take. I preface this by sharing I did not have the best upbringing, and I have no support system; I'm just trying to do my best with what I have.

I left the house with 15 extra minutes this morning to head to a doctors appointment (specialist that I have fought to get in with). I stopped to pick up my coffee from the nearby shop, pulled out of my parking spot and began to exit the lot, stopping at the stop sign. As I move to pull forward, someone flew in front of me from the right side, making me slam on my brakes. Someone approached on my left, so I quickly put myself into reverse to pull back a foot so they could pass. At the same moment, another car (a woman on her phone) pulled forward from the drive thru and we made contact. 

My car is grey/brown, already has some scratches from the past decade, and I am not someone who cares enough to fix every one of them so my bumper looked no different to me. Her car was white, and now had a black scratch just along the edging. Not a deep scratch, no denting, no damage to the headlight on that side. I understand that there is a best way to handle these situations, but out of panic to make my doctors appointment, that did not happen. 

I immediately apologized for the accident, and then asked if we could exchange information and handle this later in the day. She got upset, reasonably, and demanded my information. I told her only as long as I got hers. She said, well, then we are going to have to call the police and wait around. It has taken me so long to get in with this specialist, and the thought of missing my appointment sent me in to a panic, so I just agreed to send her a copy of my insurance card. I got her number and a photo of her license plate and she of mine. She refused to provide me with her insurance information, and I did not feel that I had the time to stick around and argue or wait to have a report filed, so we both pulled away. I know how wrong I was, and there is absolutely no excuse for it; I should have stayed, and handled it proper.

After my appointment, I reached out to my insurance agent for advice and he did not have much to offer. He could send me to the claims department, and I could speak with them but it would likely end in a claim regardless/be on record. He also mentioned waiting to see if she even does anything with the idea being; if the cost of the paint is minimal for repair, is the deductible even worth it? I don't really know where to go from here or what to do. HELP.",1,1742575027.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

The ultrasound rolled around and the results came back and I definitely have fatty liver disease.

I mean it literally felt like my whole world was about to end lol. and that I’d die young without the possibility of marriage or growing old then I just kind of accepted it.

She kindly turned him down and I, admittedly, occasionally check their text thread because I don’t like the energy he’s giving off, though I fully trust my gf. I don’t like the thought of someone actively disrespecting me by pursuing my gf knowing she’s seeing someone. Anyway he regularly ask her to grab a bite, and most recently invited her to top golf. She told him she’d be open to doing coffee so they could study instead. 

Under normal circumstances I’d be fine with this, as she typically ignores his advances to go get food and flat out leaves him on read, however this time she hasn’t mentioned going to get coffee with him once, nor has she even ever talked about him. She is the type of person to do something she doesn’t want to do just to avoid hurting someone’s feelings. I am uncomfortable with her meeting 1 on 1 with a guy that’s clearly trying to “court” her, but she doesn’t know I check their messages. And again I fully trust her. It’s not her intentions that bother me, it’s HIS, and it does bother me that she’s agreeing to go out one on one with him and not even mentioning it to me (likely to avoid the conflict. Is this something that’s normal to be worried over? Maybe I am overreacting? ",5,1742574628.0,relationship_advice,77,0.59,False

1jgkxgr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jgkxgr,"Cycling Alaska to Argentina: the Atacama Desert, Chile, Argentina, Bolivian Lagunas","It took an entire week to complete the infamous Lagunas Route, a 300-mile [500 km] sandpit that snakes its way along the Atacama Desert dividing Chile and Bolivia. I pored over elevation maps each night in fearful apprehension, and by each morning the road sat up to meet me like a clay-colored fist. Altiplanic dunes changing color by the hour. Stampedes of sand and unrelenting headwind. Nameless jeep tracks through the dust of rocky shrapnel. I kept thinking that the hardest parts were behind me, but they never stopped coming.
 
Over the Hill of Black Death at +16,100 ft [4,907 m]. Past the Salvador Dalí Desert. Past Laguna Colorada, then Laguna Blanca. When I finally hiked my bike into the Bolivian aduana [customs] exit office, I laid down on the floor in spent exhaustion. Their tiny outpost was the day’s sole escape from the wind which roared outside like a subsonic war horn, specters of emptiness in all directions.
 
From there I pushed through the remaining daylight hours to reach the Chilean border office in time, a small A-frame structure in the literal middle of nowhere. Immigrations officers cheered my approach, whistling with one fist in the air. Their green army fatigues were sharply pressed. Hair slicked back and cleanly shaven. I shared some dried apricots and they offered hot coffee, advising me to stay with them overnight because the sun was setting and it would be too dangerous to bike further. I rolled out my sleeping bag in the corner and curled up like a dog.
 
Most people head west from there towards San Pedro de Atacama. But I was too tired for more, not wanting to climb back up the notorious switchbacks en route. I turned left instead, another 75 miles atop dizzying lunar altitudes for Paso Jama, the only open border crossing into Argentina.
 
More Mars-like desert. More lassos of wind. Extraterrestrial valleys with mineral lakes in odd pastels. Flamingos and flightless Rhea birds dotted the outskirts. I stopped often but not for photos, just to breathe, turning back at each barbed hilltop to watch the horizon wither in the distance.

1jgku1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1jgku1s/lacking_confidence_to_start_my_own_business_but/,Lacking confidence to start my own business but it’s all I think about ?,"For years now all I think about it’s starting my own business, I currently work full time and I don’t hate my job and it pays me well, above average I would say, I could progress further in this role if I focus and don’t give up - but it’s difficult as it’s stressful as I work in healthcare. I would have little freedom and in healthcare there’s a LOT of learning always so your always having to do some courses and then deal with crappy managers and bad attitudes. ANYWAY regardless of all of this I don’t hate it and it’s pays me well and I do enjoy it. 

However, for years now probably around 4-5 years all I think about is starting own business. Iv had like 100 ideas of what I want to do but can’t seem to focus on one. When I do I just talk myself out of it and start comparing myself to other businesses owners and then I start to feel like I’ll just be a failure and I’m fooling myself if I think I can start a business. Literally I know nothing about running a business I come from a working class family I was the first person in my family to go to uni and all I know is to wake up and go to work - I lack confidence plus I am very dyslexic. However I have two degrees one at masters level which sometimes I feel like I should give myself more credit, 

Anyway, so what iv been thinking about starting ; 

1) cleaning business - I decided against this as I HATE cleaning lol and I would need to find trustworthy hard working cleaners and probably will need to get my hands dirty and clean also. I decided I don’t want this. 

2) clothing online business ( specifically focused around modest wear) I have some great idea but I feel like everyone and their grandmama has a clothing business right now, it’s over saturated and I need at least 10k-15k as a start to make it. I do not want to borrow money or go in debt. Benefits I can work from anywhere, I would deal with customer’s but not this constant face to face you know. The idea of being creative makes me so excited? Meeting with suppliers, manufacturers, creating something out of nothing makes me so excited. It would be tough I know but I feel like I can do it before I just have the confidence, I see people online with their own clothing brand and I feel like… what the hell they are making rubbish clothes and selling lol, I could do it sooo much better. Not being big headed but people are selling so much fast fashion, crap material, cheap, polyester everything, some brand are literally identical, everyone is in their office era right now blazers bloody everywhere where. Anyway I’m ranting but still completion is fierce since there is sooo many amazing brands out there and who am I a nobody.. not like these influencers who have an audience and a following. 

3) having my own coffee shop ( again over saturated, will be competing with big coffee chains, also will mean I would need to be present at the coffee shop a LOT make sure people are making good bloody coffees - since I’ll probably mostly employ young people and they won’t even care. iv worked in a coffee shop before competition is fierce. Long days, early mornings.. unhappy customers, hmmm tax tax tax that you have to pay and what if you don’t make enough revenue, you’ll need to sell crap load of coffees. 

4) aesthetic business - beauty treatments/ Botox / injections etc. I have thought about this a lot, since I am a professional healthcare worker I can easily train up and start building all my skills up, HOWEVER what puts me off is that I could not care less about this obsessed world we live in right now where girls are full with fillers and botox. Basically I am not passionate enough about it. I would need to be a sales wizz since I would need to build a strong customer base, I hate pleasing people and the idea of communicating with people face to face constantly!!! I don’t wanna be dealing with vain, overly obsessed girls when it comes to their looks and girls who literally are addicted to cosmetic work. Basically I don’t believe in the model and I myself have never had a facial or any work done to myself so how would I persuade other people to do it lol. However there is a need now since people are obsessed with this looks. 

What keeps me up at night most is the idea of an online business, e commerce as they call it, I want to be able to work from anywhere, build a successful brand and sell sell sell via online purchases. I walk down the city centre where I live and all shops are closing down - I feel like everything is just online now. Huhhhh what do you advise, anyway good tips pleaseee. This will sound dramatic but I literally lose sleep over this i feel like my soul is screaming at me to make the jump and find the confidence and motivation to go for it.

1jgktq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jgktq4/my_son_said_the_neighbors_cat_told_him_shes_dead/,My son said the neighbor's cat told him she's dead,"“Mommy, why do things die?”

I turned to my son from the stove. He sat at the worn-out cream wooden table, his feet dangling towards the tile. Too small. Too small to touch the floor. 

“Where did that question come from, honey?” I ask, laughing and turning back to the cooking bacon quietly. 

*Pop. Sizzle. Pop.* 

“Mr. Nate’s cat,” he replied.

*Pop. Sizzle.*

“Well, I guess, sometimes, when someone or something is very old, or sick, or has been hurt in a way that can't be fixed, they die. That means their body stops working. Death is a natural part of life.” I paused. “Did something happen with Mr. Nate’s cat, Seb?”

*Pop.* 

“She told me she’s dead.”

–

He was good, my boy, Sebastian. 

He used to sleep all through the night. Him, a baby blue blanket my late mom crocheted when she found out I was having a boy, and the baby monitor right next to his crib. I felt like I was blessed to have such a quiet baby. He never fussed or made a mess. Even when he began to speak, he always said, “Yes, ma’am,” or “Yes, sir.” People would stop and say, “You must be a wonderful mother—teaching your boy such manners at this young age.”

They’d smile. I’d smile. Sebastian would smile.

He was such a good student, too. Always came home with a project or another. I didn’t have to ask him to get good grades. He just knew. I think he knew that it was just me and him. His dad split when he was one. Now, at seven, he had the biggest mind of all the third graders in his class. His teacher called me one day to tell me he’d be the next Einstein. I was so proud. So proud to think that maybe I, a single mom, could have parented the next Einstein. 

When I think about him now, in this moment, I guess I never should’ve been a mom. 

–

Everything started going downhill when he brought up that cat. 

*Mr. Nate’s cat is really scared, Mom. She said it’s dark in there. She wants to meet you.* 

I just brushed it off. Laugh. It hadn't even been a few days since he brought this cat up. What was I supposed to do? I tried telling him she couldn’t talk. She can’t do that. Cats can’t speak, right? I thought that I should put an end to it. But how? I finally decided that when Seb was at school, I would go to Nate’s house and see what all the fuss was about. 

–

Walking up to the door, I didn't think anything was wrong. But the redwood and golden knob taunted me in the faded fall sun. 

Nate was an older man. Late sixties. He'd always been there for me and Seb after Seb’s dad left. He called me his surrogate daughter, in a way. His had died when she was twenty. Lila. Car accident. Nate didn’t like to talk about it. It definitely ate him up inside. I just didn’t think it was my place to ask. 

*Knock. Knock.* 

No answer. 

*Knock. Knock.*

No answer. 

The door creaked open. That was unlike him. Nate never kept his door unlocked because of his time in the Army. He didn’t like the thought of someone, anyone, random, barging into his house unwanted. He knew me, though, so I walked in.

It was dark. Unusually dark. Nate liked to keep a light or two on if he wasn’t home. But there were none. So, I assumed he was home, at least somewhere home. 

“Nate?” I called, looking around the house. 

Sofa. Side table. Lamp in the corner. A recliner chair in the other corner facing towards the TV. Dark books piled up on the coffee table in an erratic fashion. His house smelled sour. 

I walked into the kitchen, disgusted. On the island was a carcass. A rabbit. Cut up in weird ways. Clumps of fur scattered on the counters. Strange symbols on the cupboards and fridge. Its legs bent back. It was still breathing. 

I covered my mouth with my hands and ran towards the back of the house, nearing the bedroom. 

Nate. There. Lying in bed. Symbols drawn all over the walls. Carved into the wooden bedframe. He lay with his hands folded like he was in a coffin. A photo of his daughter, Lila, sat on the dresser beside his bed. A red circle drawn around the frame. A lock of hair right in front. Candles burning to emit a smoking plume that caked the room. And around–***Meow.*** 

That cat came out from underneath his bed. 

–

I left. I ran. I went straight home, into the bathroom, and locked the door. This was the time that Sebastian would be coming home from school. The bus should be dropping him off in front of the house right about now. I should have dinner cooked. I should be doing laundry. I should be setting the table. But I couldn’t. I couldn’t do that. He was dead. Nate was dead, and that cat was just there. She wasn’t dead. But he was. What the fuck was going on?

“Mom? I found Layla outside. She said she wants to meet you. She said you saw her. How’d you see her?""

*""She knows where you are.""*

That last sentence. Quiet. Soft. Calculated. 

What happened to my good boy?

I didn’t answer. How could I? 

Footsteps approached the door. 

–

I can hear him and the scratching at the door. It's been an hour. His little hands aching for his mother. Or were they her paws? Faint meows and begs heard from outside. 

*Mom.* ***Meow.*** *Mom, please let me in.* ***Meow.*** *Please. Mommy.* 

My face is tear-streaked, and mascara runs down my cheeks. My phone in my hands, shaking. I’m writing this from the bathroom. The door is locked. I can’t call anyone. There’s no one to call. Just me and Seb.

And that cat. ",16,1742574265.0,nosleep,3,0.87,False

We fly from Kona to Lihue Monday morning. We are staying on Kauai for 5 nights. We leave Kauai on Saturday night and will have an overnight flight. This gives us most of Monday, all day Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and most of Saturday in Kauai.

Things we want to do: hiking, visit coffee farm, snorkeling, helicopter tour, Luau, VNP.

Questions I have: 

Should we stay in Kona for two nights and Hilo for 2 nights? Or stay in one place all 4 nights and drive to opposite side of the island one day?

What is the best coffee farm to visit?

Where is the best snorkeling?

Any hikes that are a must-do? 

Are Luaus worth the money?

Any other recommendations for things to do? We are not lay on the beach/by the pool kind of people. We may do this for part of a day but we like to go out and do things.

Do you ignore? Do you redirect? What works best?

For context, I have an almost 3 year old with suspected anxiety and some sensory processing issues. She doesn’t do this behavior all of the time, but I’d say once every week or every two weeks, she’ll get angry at something (insert random toddler reason here), and throw some toys and knocks things down. It’s not super destructive if I’m being honest, she’s not throwing things at us. Nothing is breaking. She’ll knock some books off the coffee table or throw a few of her toys to the ground. It lasts 30 seconds to 2 minutes, and then it’s done. 

We try to redirect and give her safer options to express her feelings, but it never seems to work. Last night, she was doing this and my husband was trying to redirect her and it just seemed to be making it worse. So I said let’s just ignore her. We did, within a minute or so she stopped, and she pleasantly joined us at the dinner table as if nothing had happened. The thing is, it feels so tough to ignore her when this is happening.

Actually, madalas naman kami magkausap sa chat. Sometimes may disc night kami, rants and kwentuhan but all casual like we usually do. Kaya nung may naramdaman ako last time we met sa reunion, I got confused, maybe I discovered something or misunderstood his sweetness. 

So ayun, I followed some suggestions sa last post ko na ayain siya mag-meet just to hang out. Testing the waters? maybe but my mind during nun is to be his best friend. I was so excited to meet him, parang dati lang kasi uli. I'll try to be as detailed as possible sa nangyari.

Pagka-out namin, we met up sa coffee shop na near lang sa office ko. He insisted dun nalang para raw di hassle sakin. Nauna ako dun, I already ordered pastries for both of us kaso pagdating niya sabi niya siya raw sana mag treat, tbh nakalimutan ko hahaha sinabi niya pala yun. As I was observing, he's back to his default self, composed and soft spoken. Parehas kami introvert pero kapag kasama ko siya parang ako yung extro, most of the time listener ako pero pagdating sa kaniya ako yung madaldal. Anyway, nagkamustahan muna kami and onting kwento sa nangyari sa work for that day tapos may dala pala siyang regalo na hindi niya nadala last reunion. Alam niyo yung pen na pwede mag-engrave ng pangalan. He gave me the same gift I gave him nung graduation. He felt daw na he owed me something kasi wala siya binigay nung graduation lalo na naging lucky charm niya yun while taking boards kasi nakalagay dun ""Engr. (his name)"". I can't with this guy, nakalagay sa note nung gift ""To fluffy boy"" corny na nickname na tawag niya sakin kasi mataba raw pisngi ko, which I disagree pero bilog mukha ko ah not fluffy. Honestly, kinilig ako lol pero I was trying my best to keep it together and remind myself over and over not to mess up. 

Nakwento niya rin na nagstart na uli siya bumalik sa church service. Lecturer na raw siya ng church. Lowkey inaasar ko siya kasi running joke dati na magpari nalang siya kasi laging failed sa babae. Pero naopen up niya rin na he's doing it again because of personal problems. It got serious, I sensed his hesitation sa pag open up so I immediately said na if di niya kaya sabihin details ok lang. Pero he eventually said na he's been having more bad days than good days, he was unsure exactly why but marami raw factors. One is mga tao na namemeet niya, he's having a hard time finding new friends sa work na ka same niya ng wavelength kaya he said na he really missed me. Also he''s been feeling confused. He said sorry and looked so sad. That time, gusto ko nalang lumubog sa lupa kasi kinakabahan ako sa sasabihin niya. So sinabi ko nalang it's okay kahit idk yung full context. Ayaw niya lang daw talaga ako madisappoint kasi after all this time, he never felt comfortable opening it up sakin kahit na alam niya maiintindihan ko raw siya. To put it simply, he's having an identity crisis. His way to ease his confusion was mag engage uli sa church. Idk how that works pero I listened. I asked him how this started. He doesn't know daw, he's been repressing it. I felt so bad for him.

After nun naglakad lakad muna kami, may park kasi near dun and less ang tao. There he initiated a hug. He looked more relieved kaya the energy shifted. I said na I wasn't mad at him for being afraid to open up something I would totally understand. And okay lang kasi I'll still be there for him. I joked bigla ""bakit ang clingy mo na lalo na last time?"". Ewan daw at gusto niya lang lol. After namin mapagod kakaikot sa park, he insisted uli sumama magcommute sa long way pauwi. I guess sinusulit niya talaga oras namin magkasama which I appreciate. As we parted ways, I made sure na mayayakap ko siya. I also joked bago umalis na ""ito na ba love language mo?"", he replied oo hahaha. Odd kasi he's always been the acts of service guy.

To be clear, he didn't confess any feelings, neither of us. I was just there to be his friend. I wont put any further meaning kasi everything is unsure, I'll just be there for him.

This might be the last update idk if I should continue updating pero I'll just leave you guys some descriptions of us both to make all of these feel more real sa online world na itoo. We're both nerds, I'm the slim gamer nerd and he's the buffed gamer nerd. We're both tall, but he's taller. We're both soft spoken. He's a bit nonchalant, I am not but awkward at times. I can remember he described me as a ""warm"" person, he's the ""colder"" type of guy. We're both bad at coding, but for some reason we're a recipe of success kapag magkasama gumawa.

1. Brighten the Image  
   * Hey, this pic’s way too dim—can you lighten it up? Make it feel all sunny and happy, like a perfect day.
2. Make Colors More Vibrant  
   * The colors are decent, but I want them to really jump out at me—can you boost them so they’re super bold and lively?
3. Adjust Contrast  
   * Everything’s kinda mushy here—can you tweak the contrast? I want the details to pop so I can actually see what’s happening.
4. Change the Background  
   * The background’s blah and boring—how about switching it to something cool, like a deep purple fade? That’d look so much better.
5. Crop the Image  
   * There’s all this extra junk around the edges—can you chop it down to just the guy in the center? He’s the star of the show anyway.

Adding or Removing Elements

1. Add a Red Sports Car  
   * This needs some pizzazz—how about sticking a slick red sports car over on the side? That’d totally kick it up a notch!
2. Insert Birds in the Sky  
   * The sky’s just sitting there—can you throw in some birds soaring around? It’d make it feel more alive and free.
3. Remove a Tree  
   * That tree on the right is bugging me—it’s blocking everything. Can you zap it out of there?
4. Add Text  
   * I want this to say something—can you add big, chunky white letters at the top that say ‘Good Vibes Only’? That’d set the mood.
5. Add a Dog  
   * This pic’s missing some cuteness—how about popping in a scruffy little beagle right up front? I’d melt every time I see it!

Style and Mood Changes

1. Vintage Black-and-White  
   * I’m feeling all retro today—can you make this look like an old black-and-white snapshot? Like something my grandma would’ve framed.
2. Watercolor Painting Style  
   * This is too crisp for me—can you blur it into a soft, flowy watercolor? I’m craving that dreamy, artsy feel.
3. Rainy Day Mood  
   * I’m in a chill mood—can you turn this into a rainy day with dark clouds and wet streets? Perfect for curling up with tea.
4. Cyberpunk Style  
   * I’m hooked on sci-fi vibes—can you make this a glowing cyberpunk city with neon signs everywhere? Make it crazy cool
5. Cartoon Version  
   * This is too serious—can you turn it into a goofy cartoon with thick lines and wild colors? Let’s have some fun with it!

Specific Object Modifications

1. Change Shirt Color  
   * That dude’s shirt is so dull—can you swap it for a bright red one? It’d totally wake up the whole pic.
2. Modify the Cat  
   * I’m not vibing with this gray cat—can you make it a fluffy white one instead? Way cuter in my book.
3. Turn Car into Motorcycle  
   * The car’s okay, but I’d love a motorcycle more—can you change it to a shiny silver bike? That’d be epic.
4. Change Hair Style  
   * Her straight black hair’s fine, but I’d rather see it curly and red—can you switch it up? It’d look so much sassier.
5. Replace Coffee Mug  
   * Coffee’s not my jam—can you ditch the mug and put in a tall glass of iced lemonade? That’s more my speed!

Combining Instructions

1. Brighten and Add Sunset  
   * This feels dark and meh—can you brighten it and slap a gorgeous pink sunset in the back? I want warm, cozy vibes.
2. Remove People and Change to Night  
   * Too many folks cluttering this up—can you clear them out and make it a quiet night with twinkly stars? Super peaceful.
3. Make It a Snowy Scene  
   * I’m dreaming of winter—can you add snow falling and turn the house into a little wooden cabin? It’d feel so toasty.
4. Sharpen, Add Rainbow, Change Grass  
   * This is fuzzy and flat—can you sharpen it, toss in a rainbow on the right, and swap the grass for a golden desert? Let’s mix it up!
5. Sci-Fi Transformation  
   * I’m in a spacey mood—can you transform this into a sci-fi world with a floating drone and glowing blue plants? Go nuts with it!

I’ve been messing around with Grok’s natural language prompts to tweak and transform images, and honestly, it’s been way too much fun. Thought I’d share a few of the prompts I threw at it—some of these results had me cracking up or just straight-up impressed. Here’s a taste:

* Hey, this pic’s way too dim—can you lighten it up? Make it feel all sunny and happy, like a perfect day."" (Grok nailed it—suddenly, it’s like the sun came out and everything’s glowing.)
* The colors are decent, but I want them to really jump out at me—can you boost them so they’re super bold and lively?"" (Boom, instant eye candy. The colors went from “meh” to “whoa!”)
* This needs some pizzazz—how about sticking a slick red sports car over on the side? That’d totally kick it up a notch!"" (And just like that, there’s a shiny red car chilling in the scene. Grok gets me.)
* I’m feeling all retro today—can you make this look like an old black-and-white snapshot? Like something my grandma would’ve framed."" (Nailed the vintage vibe—feels like I found it in an attic.)
* This is too serious—can you turn it into a goofy cartoon with thick lines and wild colors? Let’s have some fun with it!"" (It’s like Grok turned the image into a Saturday morning cartoon. Pure chaos, and I love it.)

Seriously, if you haven’t tried this yet, you’re missing out. It’s like having a magic wand for your pics—just describe what you want, and boom, it happens.

**Why This Pick?**

I’m not sure what happened to the Grizzlies – but ever since coming back from the All-Star break they’ve been lukewarm at best. Memphis' last 3 losses have all been by at least 9 points; meanwhile, the Clippers have casually won 7 of their last 8 games, and 6 of those 7 victories were by at least 8 points. My money is on the home squad to cover the spread tonight, friends.

1jgkqc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkersComp/comments/1jgkqc6/needing_to_vent/,Needing to vent,"I don’t even know where to start. I’m not expecting anybody to respond, I’m just hoping getting this out of my system will also help with my suicidal ideation. 

It’s been two weeks since I’ve gotten paid and subsequently ate a meal. I’m not hear for a pitty party but it’s just absolutely insane the level of abuse and neglect this system is allowed to put you through. Having thoughts of going and causing harm to people involved in this process isn’t a healthy feeling but it’s one I constantly battle with. It would be so satisfying to inflict the same amount of pain onto them that they have me. As they go and get off work to drive their car, get coffee, and have a warm meal I’ll be crying uncontrollably because of the fact that I’m now homeless with absolutely no assets. I’ve begged and pleaded and showed anybody and everybody my finances and what my life was coming to. This is where harming others come into play because of the lack of their sympathy. 

I tried to get antidepressants to help with everything but I was denied because “we don’t want to trigger another episode by introducing an antidepressant while you’re depressed” this came from my doctor but keep in mind my psychologist is the one who believes I need an antidepressant. 

I begged my doctor for pain meds as I’ve done the holistic side like she wanted for the last 2 years and her solution was to take away the only med that helps me sleep at night and give me a much lower, much less strong dose for the daytime. I already take it at night to help me sleep since the pain keeps me up for 6-7 hours out of the night but it also makes me extremely tired so taking it during the day is just not an option. 

I feel like I’m not being listened to and being walked all over. I’ve been nice and I’ve been mean but the only thought that keeps circling back is to go cause harm to as many people involved in my workers comp case till I’m stopped or to just end my life. 

Some might say you can come out of this, I doubt it. The amount of debt I’m in now will last for generations. I already had to correct my credit because my parents abused it when I was a kid, it’s impossible now a second time. I just feel lost in this process and extremely alone. I have no friends, no family, no help, no love, nobody to massage my back when I’m in pain, nobody to tell me they love me, nobody to tell me it’ll be ok. As a man I’m expected to bottle this up and suck it up which I do but now it’s come to the point where I’m a threat to myself and others. Go into a psych facility just to come out and be in the same situation? This is where ending my life comes into play. 

Again, let me make this really, REALLY clear, I’ve sought help, I’ve begged for help and I’ve been denied it. Delete the post if it violates the terms but at least in this moment the anger and wanting to hurt others has passed temporarily since I’ve vented it. It’ll come back because typing isn’t that connection I need but I’m hopeful this is at least enough to get me by for a few more days. 

So in short what did workers comp provide for me? NOTHING, they took more than they gave. I lost my kids, my relationship, my car, my house, my whole life. I’m left with a injury going from T11-S1 and grueling pain from the multiple fissures and bulging disks, I can barely stand up for long periods most days. I’ve applied to literally hundreds of jobs, even used the DOR to help and nobody will hire because of the strict and massive amount of accommodations I need. 

Resources I’ve tried are SDI, EBT, Section 8, and SSDI to which I was turned down for various reasons. ",6,1742574027.0,WorkersComp,14,1.0,False

1jgknf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jgknf5/fn_magic_in_the_moonlight/,[FN] Magic in the Moonlight,"Spotlights from the back of house glisten upon Moonlight and her bright red hair as she stands before a packed crowd at Engelton Amphitheatre. They sit in silence, for they had already seen her levitate above stage and fly in a loop through rings of floating fire. How she had done it, nobody could say, but they are waiting now for something special. Something that will blow them away.

“There once was a mage,” Moonlight began, her voice confident with a gentle strength, “a mage long ago who commanded an army. He marched them upon the barren fields of The Badlands to fight The Demon King and his army. They fought bravely, and overcame The Demon King’s forces, but he received word that among the wounded was his young love. She died there as they attempted to close her wound, for no magic or human intervention could save her. The mage mourned, for she was not meant to be at the battle, and the mage, after emerging from his keep after three days, traveled to the barren fields and cast a spell on the land. He wanted to eradicate death, so where he struck his staff, a field of Dalmatian irises sprung up, as far as the eye could see, smelling so sweet that the inhabitants of the next town over, having known only the stench of death, recounted now of the sweetness of the air. It is said that no living creature, no man nor beast, would ever pass through death’s doorsteps when they strode through that field of irises.”

A wave of breathless anticipation rolled over the crowd.

She wears a white blouse and long black skirt — a dark masquerade mask covering the skin around her eyes — and with a long wooden staff in hand, she says, “I will take you there, to that very field, and you may play among the flowers.” She strikes the staff into the ground, and a sound like thunder radiates from its epicentre. Violets and greens spread out in waves from where she struck, all across the venue, small flowers blooming from the stage in which she performs, to the long aisle that leads up to it, to the rows and floor beneath everyone’s feet.

The crowd rise to their feet in thunderous applause, as a gentle unmistakable sweetness pervades the venue. “And one more thing,” says Moonlight, and with the wave of a hand, small winged creatures — butterflies seemingly appearing in the outline of golden light — begin to flutter through this newly christened field. The crowd cheer again, one lightened butterfly landing on the wrist of a young girl. Moonlight bows, takes in the praise of clapping and roaring, and disappears behind the veil.

After their midday show, at a table on the sunlit veranda of The Enlightened Piggy Tavern, Moonlight — who appears to be in her mid thirties though carries the aura of being older than time itself — is met by a younger beauty, a girl of nineteen, with dark hair and dark Windsor glasses. She sits down. “Hell of a show, Moonlight.” she says. “Or can I call you Maggie, now that the show is over? You had them all buzzing.”

Maggie Moonlight smiles, folds her arms, and relaxes back into her chair. 

“News will spread fast. They’ll want another show,” the young woman says.

“Then we’ll give it to them, Gabrielle.”

The waiter brings over coffee and two slices of strawberry cake. Maggie spoons a helping into her greedy mouth, and licks her lips clean.

“But I’ve been thinking,” says Gabrielle. “I’m only here to shine a spotlight on you, literally. That’s my whole job. To keep you in the spotlight when you’re up on stage.” She taps at her fork nervously. “Why don’t you trust me to be part of the act?”

Maggie sets down her utensil. “You’re the brains behind the whole operation. You come up with the tricks. You write the script. I only perform the magic.”

“Maybe I’d like to perform an illusion one day,” Gabriele says boldly.

“Your magic is experimental. Thus less consistent and harder for you to replicate. You think outside the box. That’s why we work. I’m a refiner,” says Maggie. “I simply refine your ideas so I can perform them on stage. You’re raw while I’m seasoned. I’ve simply been doing this for longer.” Maggie pauses. A knowing smile appears on her face. “But if you think you can perform a trick in front of everyone, prove me wrong.”

Just then the waiter arrives with a papered message. “Thank you,” says Maggie, and she dismisses him.

With concern on her face, Gabrielle asks, “what does it say?”

“Something’s amiss with the mayor and her new advisor. Says there are plans being laid for a canal to bring water to The Badlands.”

“That’ll mean…”

“Right. They’re trying to support an army. We must go to the mayor, and investigate at once.”

The pair find Mayor Coburn in her office at Engleton Town Hall, behind a desk stacked with thick books and papers. An orange tabby cat lays on her desk, licking at its paws.

“What’s this we hear of plans to fuel the Demon King’s resurgence?” demands Maggie.

Mayor Coburn smiles, deviously it appears, her blonde wavy hair falling to her shoulders. “Demons simply want to live amongst us. I cannot deny them a basic human privilege such as drinking water. They want to live good lives, just like us.” Her voice monotone and robotic, without rise or fall.

Maggie raises a fist. “But these demons are not human, Mayor. They are…”

The door behind the office opens to a young man, clad in violet tuxedo with slick back hair. He has an aura that matches, perhaps exceeds Maggie’s. He appears young too, though has that similar element of timelessness. “Greater than human,” he says, concluding her sentence.

“Overdressed much?” says Gabrielle, and her face contorts to a look of disgust as if she is smelling something rotten.

“My name is Count Verde. I am the new advisor to the mayor.”

“Let me guess. You’re a demon,” says Maggie dismissively.

“ I am a concerned citizen with ties to The Badlands…”

“Yeah,” says Gabrielle, “you’re a fricken demon.”

“And you’ve possessed the mayor, haven’t you?” pleads Maggie.

“You’ve come with vile attempts at accusation,” Count Verde says, defending himself.  “Here to undermine my name and the work that the Mayor has done. Will you not listen to reason? Demons are simply the next iteration of human. The inheritor of the world they left behind. And as humans give way, ceding their world to us, we must work together in cooperation in the meanwhile. In brotherhood.”

“I know a demon when I see one,” says Maggie, pointing. “And your lies, the foundation you are built on, will be your ultimate downfall. For there was a fatal flaw in your design. There’s no getting out of this one.”

“So you have found me out. But know I will not play nice.” Count Verde takes off his suit and tosses it to the corner, rolling up his sleeves and putting up his fists, ready for a fight.

The Mayor runs out the door screaming, shutting in the tabby cat following close behind her. Mewls from the kitty flood the room, as it retreats behind a potted plant in the corner. Maggie and Gabrielle take two steps back. ‘Papers will fly everywhere,’ Maggie thinks. ‘We’ll scratch the floral wallpaper. Maybe a few windows will break. But I’ve never fought in an office before. This will be… exciting!’

“You ready, girlie?” asks Maggie.

“You bet,” answers Gabrielle.

They put up their fists. And the demon charges in.

He conjures a flaming sword, swinging it at their heads, but Maggie and Gabrielle dodge away. He continues the relentless assault upon Maggie, swinging the sword back and forth, and Maggie stumbles to the floor, busting her lip. As Count Verde thrusts the searing sword at her, aiming to put it right through her chest, Gabrielle dives in and provides a dome of light around Maggie. Protective magic. Gabrielle’s specialty. The dome shields Maggie, and the sword crashes down on it, clanging, glancing off the shield. When Count Verde retreats a moment to gain his breath, Gabrielle hoists Maggie up from the floor.

“No offence. Only defence,” says Count Verde. “I thought you would provide more of a challenge.”

“We’re only getting started,” Maggie says, wiping crimson from her bloodied mouth.

Maggie conjures a staff, and it materializes in her hand. She lashes it toward him, and a flood of lightened butterfly move in a targeted wave towards Count Verde, overwhelming him, blinding him. He shields his eyes, falls to a knee.

Quick, finish him off,” shouts Maggie.

Gabrielle summons a staff of her own, and unsure of where to aim it, she strikes it upon the potted plant, and it turns magically into a cupcake.

“What the hell?” Maggie yells.

Gabrielle shrugs. Count Verde struggles to his feet, the assault of butterflies waning from Maggie’s staff. Gabrielle points again. Tips it forward.

“Meow!” the cat screams, and suddenly in its place is a brownie topped with whip cream.

“I said finish him off, not feed him with a brownie cat!”

Gabrielle steels herself. Closes her eyes, breathes deep a moment. She takes aim at the demon once more. But the power of the butterfly assault is concluding, and Count Verde manages to stand against the diminishing storm. Gabrielle takes aim one last time, waves her staff towards him, and boom!

Where he stood, is a five tier vanilla wedding cake, waiting to be eaten.

“That was close,” says Maggie. Relief descending upon the dynamic duo.

When the fight is over, Mayor Coburn returns.

“That man advising you was a demon working for The Badlands. His effect on you will not last. You’ll be better in no time,” says Maggie.

“Great. But where’s Fluffy?” asks Mayor Coburn.

The pair are seen dumping the wedding cake at the pig trough at The Enlightened Piggy Tavern, where the bar owners keep three pigs as pets.

The next week the pair are at the Engleton Amphitheatre, performing once again. It is a sold out show. And this time, Gabrielle, bright eyed, takes centre stage.

From behind her back she pulls an old newspaper. She smiles, a wide-grinned smile, finally having her chance at the big times. “Look here,” Gabrielle begins. “A regular old newspaper. You can’t find the happenings of your own day to day here, nor most smidgens of good news. But every now and then, you’ll encounter something delightful, something sweet.” She fans out the newspaper. Conjures her staff. And blasts it into a five tier vanilla cake. She pulls out more newspaper, and turn them into cake as well. “Cake for all!” Gabrielle shouts. The crowd erupts in a frenzy, and a host of servers arrive from the darkened corridors with carts of plates and cutlery, passing a piece of cake to every person in every row. “This is the news, and this is how it spreads. Cake for all! Spread the good news!” And Maggie Moonlight shines the spotlight on the young beautiful Gabrielle, as she strides up and down the aisles, exciting the crowd.",1,1742573828.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Please help me understand!,"Dear community, I wanted to share my recent experience (TL;DR at the end) to see if others have noticed something similar or have any advise, I’ve had CFS for +2 years, I'd say is mild but unable to work. My main issue is ""just"" PEM when I exceed my limits (mid-severe fatigue, sore throat, intense back paint). If I stay within my limits, which I know now very well, I feel 70-75% normal which is not bad at all considering the situation.

I’ve tracked my diet micros/macros, barely eat processed foods, for the last 12 weeks taken NAC, PQQ, Ubiquinol, glutamine, creatine, d-ribose, l-carnitine, R-ALA which do absolutely nothing AT ALL. Blood tests 2 weeks ago were fine, except slightly high cholesterol and Epstein–Barr was positive but I know that alone does not mean much.

I live in Belgium (cold, very little sun). 2 weeks ago, I traveled to Puglia, Italy where the weather was great, spent 6 days outdoors walking 8-10 hrs, drinking wine, coffee, gelato, dehydrated by the end of the day, poor diet, yet felt 75-90% normal! better than I have in years despite clearly exceeding my known limits, every day I was expecting PEM at any moment (as it usually happens when I push a bit) but it never happened, instead each day I felt better and better (only the first day I felt around 60% due to the lack of sleep the previous day), some days I did felt I needed a break so we would sit for a while and then I pushed to continue the tour. Back in Belgium, I felt great (\~85% normal) for 3 days in which I didn't do much, then a 1-hr walk dropped me back to my usual 70-75% and haven't improved.

My current theories are: 1- The sun exposure and better air quality? 2- There is something at my home that is causing me this, perhaps mold (although, is it possible to see improvements in less than 24hrs?) 3- The air quality in general here in Belgium?...

To test those theories: I just got a NIR light therapy panel to test for 30 days and I am doing 20min a day whole body, if no change then I am planning to go to a hotel for 1 week here in Belgium, if no change then I will go back to Puglia for 2-4 weeks.

After this I will try oxaloacetate for 30 days, nicotine patches and I need to find a Dr. that is willing to prescribe LDN. I am also planning to do a mitochondria test since I am assuming my problem lies there but just to make sure.

Any idea what is going on or suggestions to try? thanks.





**TL;DR:** I have mild CFS (unable to work) with PEM as my main issue. Despite tracking diet and taking various supplements nothing has helped. A recent trip to Puglia, Italy saw me walking 8-10 hours daily with a poor diet and even dehydration, yet I felt *better* than in years and no PEM, improving daily. Back in Belgium, I felt great for 3 days, then back to my usual baseline. Theories on what helped during the trip: sun exposure, air quality, or something in my home (mold?). I'm currently testing with NIR light, then I'll try a hotel stay to rule out the mold at home, then possibly returning to Puglia to reproduce results. Next steps: oxaloacetate, nicotine patches, LDN, and a mitochondria test.",23,1742573767.0,cfs,36,0.9,False

## Electric Kettle Energy Consumption: Speed, Efficiency,​ and Smart Features

Electric kettles have surged in popularity thanks to their⁢ convenience ⁤and ‌often⁤ perceived speed. But how do they fare in terms of energy‍ efficiency?​ Let's break down the key factors influencing electric kettle energy⁢ consumption:

*   **Heating Element:** Most electric kettles use an immersion heating element placed directly in the water. This direct contact allows for rapid heating, reducing energy loss.
*  ⁢ **Automatic Shut-Off:** A critical feature in most electric kettles is automatic shut-off once the water boils. This‌ prevents wasted energy and potential safety hazards, unlike ‌stovetop kettles, which can continue boiling indefinitely if unattended.
*   **Wattage Considerations:** Electric kettle wattage typically ranges from 1000 to 3000 watts. A higher wattage kettle will ⁣boil water faster, but it will also draw more power during that time. However,the quicker⁣ boiling time can offset the⁢ higher wattage,possibly leading to overall energy savings compared⁤ to a lower-wattage kettle that takes⁢ longer to boil. Consider rapid boil kettle energy use when choosing.
*  ​ **Variable Temperature Kettles:** modern variable temperature kettle energy usage can be optimized by selecting a target temperature for specific beverages. This prevents⁣ overheating and saves energy by only heating the water ⁢to the‍ required temperature, ⁣rather than always bringing it to a full boil.
*   **Energy Star ⁤Kettles:** ​While not as ⁣prevalent as other energy Star ⁤appliances,some electric kettles meet specific energy efficiency standards. Look for this certification when comparing models ​to identify⁢ potentially more sustainable kettle options.

## Stovetop ⁤Kettle Energy Consumption: Gas vs. Electric Stoves

Stovetop⁢ kettles, an ‌older technology, rely on an external heat source⁢ to boil water. Let's examine factors impacting​ stovetop kettle energy consumption:

*   **Heat Source Efficiency:** The efficiency of the heat source plays a significant ‍role. ⁢gas stoves generally have lower efficiency than electric stoves, meaning more energy is lost to the surrounding environment. Consider stovetop kettle gas usage if applicable.
*   **Kettle Material:** The material of the stovetop kettle also⁣ impacts efficiency. Copper and stainless steel kettles tend to heat faster than cast iron, but ⁢this may influence how conductive the kettle will be.*   **Boiling Time:** ​Stovetop⁤ kettles often take‌ longer to boil water than electric kettles, leading to increased energy consumption. This is particularly true on gas stoves, where heat can ⁣dissipate quickly.
*   ⁤**Lack of Automatic Shut-Off:** The absence of automatic shut-off in most stovetop kettles presents a significant energy waste risk. If ‍unattended, the kettle will continue to boil, wasting⁢ energy and potentially causing ⁤damage.

## Electric Kettle vs. Stovetop Kettle Efficiency: The numbers Don't Lie (Mostly)

So, ​who wins the energy efficiency showdown? While ther's some debate, the general consensus leans toward⁢ electric kettles being more energy-efficient.Many studies suggest that electric kettles are about 80% efficient, whereas stovetop kettles​ hover around 70%⁤ efficient. this difference stems from the direct heating element in electric kettles and the potential for ⁣heat loss with stovetop⁣ methods.

Though, the type of stove matters. Using a stovetop kettle on⁤ an ⁢induction cooktop, which heats the pot directly, can significantly improve efficiency ⁤compared to a gas stove. Induction kettle energy use can approach the efficiency of some electric kettles.

## Cost to Boil Water: Dollars and Cents Analysis

Beyond efficiency, let's examine the cost to boil water using each method. To calculate this, you'll need to know:

*   **Electricity Rates:** Your local ‍electricity rate (dollars per kilowatt-hour).*  ‍ **Gas Prices:** The price⁢ of natural gas (dollars per therm).
*   **Kettle Wattage/BTUs:** the electric kettle's wattage or the stovetop's BTU rating.
*  ⁣ **Boiling Time:** The time it takes each kettle to boil a specific amount of water.

Here's a simplified example (remember ​to use your actual figures):

**Electric ‌Kettle:**

*   1500-watt kettle (1.5 kW)
* ⁤  Electricity rate: $0.20 per kWh
*   Boiling time: 3 minutes (0.05 hours)
*   Energy consumption: 1.5 kW * 0.05 hours = 0.075 ⁢kWh
*   Cost: 0.075 kWh * $0.20/kWh = $0.015

**Stovetop Kettle (electric Stove):**

*   Electric⁣ stove element: 2000 watts (2 kW) While⁢ the⁣ element is 2000 watts, ‍efficiency losses mean more energy is used overall.
*  ⁣ Electricity rate: $0.20 per kWh
*   Boiling time: 5 minutes (0.083 hours)
*   Energy consumption: 2 kW * ⁤0.083 hours = 0.166 kWh
*⁤   Cost: 0.166 kWh⁢ * $0.20/kWh = $0.033

**Stovetop Kettle (Gas Stove):**

*   Gas stove ‌burner:⁣ 10,000 BTU/hour (Convert BTU to kWh for consistent comparison. 1 BTU = 0.000293 kWh)
* ‍  Gas price: $1.50 ⁤per therm (1 therm‌ = 29.3 kWh) Thus cost per kWh is around ⁣$0.05. This value is much smaller so there may still be more over all expense to using the gas kettle.
*   Boiling time:⁢ 7 minutes (0.117 hours)
*   Energy consumption: (10,000 BTU/hour * 0.000293kWh/BTU) * 0.117 hours ⁤= 0.343 kWh
*   Cost: ‍0.343 kWh * $0.05/kWh = $0.017

In this⁤ example, the electric kettle is​ the clear winner, ⁣followed by the gas stovetop kettle. However, induction cooktops could yield closer results depending on the⁢ model. ​This simplified example does not take into ​account the diffrent fuel⁤ costs.⁣ Be sure to factor in‍ current local energy rates and water boiling demand to⁢ perform an adequate assessment of cost to ⁣boil water electric kettle compared to‍ the cost to boil water stovetop kettle for your usage.
