A break up caused me to get honest with myself and my disease which I kept denying for many years. Getting back with this girl (hopefully) has always been my carrot on a stick during my sobriety. However that ship has sailed and there's no chance of that happening. Now I'm left with getting sober for myself and my self esteem is still really shaky.

A last note. I had thought about doing this cover for the past year, but doubted myself for a number of reasons. When I found out my agency, NEXAS, was shutting down, it felt like the timing was telling me to do it.

1hlrz94,https://i.redd.it/mto4ehppow8e1.jpeg,"""May the stars bless our union"" ","**“To your smile, I dedicate this beautiful star ridden sky.”**

A day like many for Mikamo Neru, the leader of C&C. After waking up and putting on her uniform, complete with her jacket and her twin MPX submachine guns, she meets up with her colleagues and starts heading with them to deal with some troublemakers that showed up near the school precinct; the usual. Until, in the midst  of battle, a little rumbling in her pockets caused by her smartphone catches her attention: 

“Are you free today Neru? Wanna spend some time with me?” were the words written in the message sent by SCHALE’s Sensei, catching her off guard as the battle draws to a victory.

It wasn’t uncommon for Sensei to ask Neru out, as they had been going around to the arcade and going around visiting different places a lot to hang around with each other, but he’d usually tell his plans for the day beforehand instead of being so vague.

“Ha…? What’s this idiot up to now?” Is what she thought as she responded to his message, writing: “Sure thing, just don’t take me figurine shopping again. Who in their sane mind takes someone who knows nothing about the series they’re taking figures of out shopping with them?!”.

A few moments later, a new message pops up reading: “I’m so sorry… But can you blame me?! There was a new release I just couldn’t miss out on, cut me some slack!”. As she finishes reading, she chuckles to herself before muttering quietly: “Heh, dork…”

“When do you want to meet up? After you finish up work at SCHALE?”, she texts.

“That’s what I had in mind. Can we stay out late? I want to take you somewhere later tonight.” Is what his message reads. This only makes Neru more suspicious about his plans for their day out, considering they’d usually stay out very late when they’re together, sometimes even up to 2AM, but he had never asked for such confirmation before.

“Sure… But do you mind telling me what's up? You know we stay out late together normally, so why are you asking now?” she responds. 

“Sorry, it's a surprise. You'll see tonight, after we finish up with our outing."" The text says, only growing her suspicions. But deciding it's best for her to not question him, she quickly drops the thought. 

“Alright then. See you later in your office. What do you say about 4PM?” she sends. 

“Perfect. Through some miracle today I have less paperwork than usual, so I should be free much earlier. I'll make myself ready around that time.” After she reads his message, she can only do so much before gently smiling at the thought of hanging out with Sensei. 

XXXXXVVVVVXXXXX

It's about 3:45PM, and I'm getting ready to receive Neru in my office to go and spend time together, having changed into more comfortable and casual clothes. I make sure to take everything I need for today, slipping my wallet and phone into the inner pocket of my jacket, and carefully position a small box in the left side pocket of my pants before hearing a knock on the door. 

I open the door to find Neru in a grey sweater and hotpants, still rocking her sukajan on top of them. Her guns were nowhere to be seen, probably left back at her apartment so as to not burden herself with carrying them during our time together.

“Yo, Sensei! How’re you doing today? Are you really not telling me what we’re doing today…?” She asks with a curious expression, still wondering about the plans I have prepared for our day out. Unfortunately for her, as much as I want to tell her what we’re going to be doing, I’d prefer keeping it a secret to make her enjoy the surprise at the end.

“‘Sup Neru! I’m doing as I normally would, a bit happier since I’m not submerged in work today and seeing you now also helps with my mood. And to answer your question, you’ll see later tonight~!” I reply as I put a finger on my mouth, indicating my silence on the matter, and wink at her. She diverts her eyes, flustered by my slightly flirtatious answer and gestures before speaking up.

“W-whatever, moron! Just get a move on already, let’s not waste anymore time and get right to it. Are you fully prepared?” She asks, having recomposed herself quickly from the prior interaction. I check my pockets for everything before giving her the okay.

“Yup. Off to the mall we go then!” I happily declare as I exit the office and close the door, with Neru following suit besides me. We start heading to the mall as per intended.

“Need to buy some stuff, or maybe you wanna hit up the arcade today?” She asks. She always seems to know what I’m thinking about, since I was just about to tell her about my wanting to buy some things for her and some necessities I need for the office, mainly energy drinks in preparation for some all-nighters that are obviously going to happen soon and going to the arcade to play a few rounds at the fighting game cabinet and maybe a pair of rounds at DDR.

“What if I were to tell you both? How do some rounds in the fighting game and DDR sound?” I ask her cheerfully, before getting hit with a light jab of her elbow.

“ANYTHING but DDR. You know I much prefer racing games instead of that… Also, how are you so damn good at it?!” She cries, as I chuckle lightly at her overly-exaggerated outburst, knowing full well she isn’t very fond of any of the dancing cabinets present at an arcade.

“I know, I know… But what if one day you come to enjoy it? And as for how I am so good at it, I’d say it’s mostly due to lots of practice in my free time. I could ask you the same about how you seem to drive so well in those driving games, seeing as I suck at them.” I admit truthfully, earning myself a light chuckle in return.

“Heh, guess you’re right. I guess a few rounds at the dancing machine won’t do me any harm. In return, you’ll let me teach you how to drive like the undisputed champion. What do you say?” She says cheerfully, prompting a gentle laugh to escape my lips.

“Sure thing. Let’s hit up some stores before that. I have to buy some energy drinks in case I have to pull another all-nighter, which is likely. We can also go check the game reseller and see if they have anything you like, like the new issue of that gaming magazine you like.” I tell her, lightening her face and mood furthermore.

“You truly know me well, dont’cha?” She says with a bright smile, making me blush at her unexpected cuteness.

“I could say the same about you.” I retort, looking away embarrassed, as I calm myself down.

For the next few minutes, we discuss less important things, such as how it’s going with her club and how we’ve spent our past few days as we reach our destination. The mall is slightly crowded, but it’s not as bad as if it were a saturday evening, so we proceed with our shopping: buying the drinks, the new issue of Neru’s gaming magazine and window shopping some jackets together. We then decide to hit up a cafè and order something before going to the arcade.

We sit down and I order an espresso, while Neru decides to take a parfait. A few minutes later the waiter comes to our table with our order.

“How are you able to drink espressos without any sort of sweeteners…? Are you trying to look cool or do you actually enjoy it like that?” Neru questions me, while savoring each bite of her parfait.

“I actually enjoy it like that, I don’t care about looking cool, don't worry. You want to try it? Once you get the hang of its bitterness it becomes pretty tasty.” I respond as I push my coffee closer to her.

“Nah, I’m fine with this. I much prefer sweet stuff. Thank you for the offer, though.” She shuts me down as she keeps indulging in her sugary snack. I quickly finish up my drink and wait for her to finish eating. 

A few minutes pass and we exit the establishment, not before paying the tab and thanking the staff. After exiting, we quickly head to the arcade. To the surprise of very few people, we spot the GDD kids playing together at the fighting game section, and decide to play a few rounds with them, both of us predictably losing to Aris’ and Yuzu’s techniques and reactions. Neru predictably got beaten, but not after getting pretty close to winning one round. As expected, the same thing happened with me, but without the almost winning part, earning me a bit of teasing from Neru. As we keep going, it all culminates with one last fight between me and Neru. We’re both pixel, and whoever does the best read wins the match.

“Just give up already Sensei, you know you won’t beat me! You should already know why I’m regarded as the strongest in Millenium!” She says, trying to taunt me into reacting first and probably lose, which I fall for.

“Oh yeah? What if I do this the-n..?!” I shout as I rush my action, earning myself a loss with a side of teasing from both the GDD kids and Neru.

“Hm? What was that, Sensei? What were you trying to do I wonder~?” She says teasingly, complete with a smug look of superiority.

“Hahaha! Sensei you actually fell for her taunt!” Says Momoi, only adding insult to injury.

“Sensei is very gullible… Aris will take note of that!” Adds Aris, probably thinking of how to use this new information for her own gain.

“Haaah. Next time keep calm and think it through without falling for such obvious taunts, Sensei.” Comments Midori, looking at me jokingly disappointed.

“H-here you should’ve done this, instead of running in…” Lectures me Yuzu, explaining in much detail what I should’ve done to win. I chuckle at the commotion, as me and Neru start heading for the DDR cabinet.

“That was lots of fun. See you, kiddos.” She states, waving goodbye to the Development Department’s members.

“It really was. The two of us will go to the Dancing machines. You lot have fun, and don’t stay out late!” I assert as I do the same.

“Okay! Bye guys!” Exclaims the group in unison, as they all wave back.

XXXXXVVVVVXXXXX

A few moments later, the two of us end up in the rhythm game section of the building, and I guide Neru to the game cabin I wanted to play so much ever since we set foot into the arcade.

“...I’m not sure I wanna do this, Sensei. Isn’t it… Embarrassing?” She utters sheepishly, likely embarrassed at the thought of failing.

“I’ll let you in on a little secret, Neru. I also thought the same when I started out. I was so embarrassed that I would straight up start a round and quit midway through out of shame. But after a while, I set that aside. Now I get compliments on how I play! Only you can decide if being a little embarrassed at the beginning is enough to stop you from playing.” I reassure her.

After a bit of hesitation, she steels up her resolve and takes place on the pad besides me.

“Alright… I’ll give it my all!” she declares with a serious yet hopeful expression as we begin playing.

We complete a few rounds, and Neru gets comfortable with the game, not feeling embarrassed anymore. We’re both kind of tired due to the exercise, with me feeling especially tired due to the high difficulty charts.

“I’ll never wrap my head around the fact you can move that fast with your feet dude. Like seriously, how do you do that?” Neru asks me awestruck, earning herself a light chuckle from me.

“Like I said before, it’s all practice. Who knows, seeing as you got over your embarrassment, you’ll also be able to do this with enough time and dedication. You’re pretty good for a beginner!” I tell her cheerfully.

“Now you’re exaggerating…” She says bashfully, turning her head and thinking about it. She clears her throat.

“A-anyways, let’s start going for the driving machines now, yeah? After all, you promised you’d let me teach you how to drive as well as me after we finished here, remember?” She remarks, changing the subject and leading me to a bike driving game.

“Alright then. I can’t wait to actually learn how to play these things!” I exclaim happily, earning me an earnest smile from Neru, who seems to enjoy my eagerness.

“Heh, you’ll be learning from the best. It’s understandable you’re so excited.” She declares with a smug tone as she sits on the bike seat and starts the game, teaching me the basics and the different techniques to cut time while dodging obstacles safely. After she ends her run, I applaud her performance. After she dismounts, she gives me a bow before laughing gently, prompting me to do the same.

“Well, let’s see how I fare with the tips the undefeated champion blessed me with, what do you say?” I say as we switch places, taking a seat on the bike saddle and starting my turn on the machine. Following Neru’s advice, I dodge and weave through clusters of obstacles. Although I still hit the occasional stage hazard, I keep it to a relative minimum, as opposed to how it’d usually go. I end the game with a decent score.

“Not bad for someone who couldn’t stay straight for 5 seconds the first time they played. I’d say I’m more “Sensei” than you, eh?” She says with a snicker, before putting her hand on mine, which is still on the accelerator. A light blush appears on my face as she starts explaining.

“At the U-turn part you should’ve pulled the brakes earlier, and since you’re a beginner you were better off taking the curve wider, not sharper.” She explains, turning her head to meet mine. Confused as to why my cheeks turned slightly red, she poses her gaze on her hand, still on mine, and quickly retracts it. She flicks her head away embarrassed, and I do the same. There’s an awkward silence for a few seconds, before Neru speaks up.

“Why’re you blushing, you idiot?! It’s not that big of a deal…” She utters, still recovering from the sudden awkwardness. Her head rotated just enough that I can’t see her face clearly, but I do catch a glimpse of crimson hue on her cheeks.

“S-sorry, sorry. I don’t know what came over me… Seeing you so focused on teaching me may have made me proud as a teacher. I guess… I guess I got distracted by you placing your hand on mine, I wasn’t expecting it.” I admit truthfully, earning me an elbow to the sides.

“Don't go making it weirder than it already is, you jackass…!” She asserts. A moment passes, and the two of us burst into laughter. 

“Yeah, you're right. My bad. I take it you didn't mind taking my hand? I certainly wasn't against it.” I tease during our moment of laughter.

“As if I'd ever mind it! I don't think anyone would have a problem with it, if it's you. Especially me.” She retorts with the small blush still present. 

Hearing that, it takes all my willpower not to pat her head at that very moment. My hand slowly moves up to the height of her head before stopping abruptly, indicating my attempt at refraining from doing said action. She quickly notices, and leans her head forward, indicating her approval. Seeing as she's fine with it, I place my head on her head and start moving it gently on her hair.

“You never change, do you?” She observes with a small giggle, accompanied with a soft, precious smile. 

“I doubt I ever truly will, not when you act this cute.” I say gently. Surprisingly, the use of the word ‘cute’ doesn't tick her off, only making her lean more into my touch. After what seems like a while, I take off my hand and lead Neru outside of the arcade.

It's about 9:20PM, and the two of us are starting to feel the effects of hunger caused by our prior exercise. We settle on a popular restaurant that opened not too long ago, and enjoy a hearty meal for the next few hours. After we're done with the feast, I decide to pay for the food, much to Neru's discontent, who suggests we split the bill equally. After a bit of arguing we decide to go for the latter and pay together. As we're leaving, I ask her what she thought of today so far. 

“Today's been great, Sensei. Thank you for making this otherwise boring and repetitive day one worth cherishing. And considering there's still something you've got prepared for me later, I only grow happier and more thankful.” She tells softly, with a heartfelt smile. The biggest, purest, and happiest smile I've ever seen Neru make, one that melts my heart instantly.
 
“I'm very glad you enjoyed it so far. Just you wait until that surprise, it will make this already beautiful day even prettier.” I state proudly as we finally exit the mall. 

XXXXXVVVVVXXXXX

It's now 11PM, and I take Neru to an isolated hill near SCHALE, hidden away from all schools and their respective residents.

“This here is my favorite spot in all of Kivotos. It's so calm.” I whisper calmly, feeling relaxed by the environment.

“...Just because of that? Is this what you've been anticipating all day…?” Asks Neru, rightfully confused by the vast emptiness surrounding us. I point up to the sky above us. 

“...Just tilt your head up a bit, then you'll understand.” I tell her gently.

As she does, she finally notices the incredible sight of uncountable stars shining in the dark sea of the night sky, making her jaw drop. 

“Woah… Where did all these stars come from? I didn't see THIS many when we were getting here…” She whispers, genuinely amazed at such an amazing sight. 

“We couldn't see them because there's a lot of light on the streets. The less light there is, the better the view. Now you understand why I like this place so much?” I note, sitting down on the grass and gazing at the stars as Neru does the same, sitting besides me. 

“Yeah… This place is amazing, alright. The sky looks… Magical, for a lack of a better word. I understand why you were hiding the fact you wanted to go here. The surprise effect did wonders!” She exclaims, stunned. As we're sitting together, she slides her hand on mine. At first, I'm not sure what to do, but then I figure it's best to let it happen, intertwining my fingers with hers.

“I'm really glad. You're the first person I've ever brought here, you know?” I reply as I lay down on the grass, dragging Neru to the soil with me, with our hands still locked together.

“This way we can see better.” I add. Looking to my left, I can see my companion still mesmerized with the view. A few seconds later, she turns to me, fixing her gaze on mine.
 
“You have no idea how happy I am at the thought that I am the person you'd show this place to first. I'm also incredibly thankful for how you treat me. You don't just view me as the ‘Strongest in Millenium’, no. You actually look at me for who I am as a person, caring about me all the way through, even during that stupid infiltration mission where we had to catch that Koyuki fool. And that's barely scraping the surface, but for the sake of keeping it short, lemme tell ya’ straight. Thank you, Sensei. For everything up until now.” She says with a heartfelt tone, as small tears of joy form on her now thankful expression.

I go to wipe her tears, but she gently stops me from doing so, letting her cheeks get wet from said tears rolling down her face. I decide it's best to let her do as she pleases, to not ruin the mood.

A bit later, the tears stop flowing, and we're left with an awkward silence, so I decide to break the ice.

“No problem, Neru. I'm glad to have a studen-, no, a FRIEND, as good as you. Someone who's willing to spend time with me, no matter the circumstances or stupidity of the actions I come up with. Someone who's by my side when I need company the most, someone who gets me. You are someone I always look forward to having fun with, have a laugh with, and just being together with in general. So let me thank you back, Neru, for always, and I mean ALWAYS, choosing to spend time with me, and helping me make a few unforgettable memories of my own.” I admit truthfully, making Neru grip my hand tighter, as she keeps her eyes fixed on the star filled horizon without speaking a word. 

A long silence later, I decide to speak up, just as Neru does the same. The two of us grip our hands tighter. 

""I'm not sure how to say it, but...""

""I've been thinking about it a lot, and…”

""Sensei…”

 “Neru…”
""I love you."" We say in unison, catching each other off-guard. This makes us turn our heads and sit up to stare at each other dumbfounded, as Neru speaks first.

“W-what the hell was that?! Why'd you have to ruin my moment?!” She cries, still shocked by the interaction.

“H-huh? Me?! You ruined my moment, not the opposite?!” I retort. A few seconds later, as the two of us keep staring at one another, we burst into laughter.
 
“What the hell was that? That was like a scene from a romance movie!” She exclaims, all the while giggling like a maniac, as I do the same.

“Don't ask me! I can't believe such a thing just happened. That was just like a cliché…” I say astonished, still giggling.

We keep laughing for a while, before falling back to the same silence we had before. A bit later, she clutches my hand tighter once more, staring with her longing red eyes into mine.

“Just to… Just to make sure, can you repeat it…?” She asks bashfully, putting our hands on her chest, much to my surprise and embarrassment, and allows me to hear the incredibly fast thumping of her heart.

“I love you, Neru.” I repeat without hesitation. This earns me a bright smile.

“I love you too, Sensei.” She says as she pulls me into a tight hug. The moment lasts for a while.

As the hug ends, our eyes meet again. I sense a feeling of longing in her gaze, and I can feel my pulse accelerating. Deciding to go for it, I lean in to go for a kiss. To my surprise, Neru puts her arms behind my neck, and pulls my lips onto hers, locking them into a kiss.

The kiss doesn't last for long, but after a taste of my lips, Neru goes for it again. This time though, she's not holding back.

She pushes her tongue into my mouth, exploring every nook and cranny, as I try to keep up with her sudden aggressiveness. It continues for a bit, until she gently pushes me on my back, sitting on top of me. Our faces still showing signs of our messy spit-swapping, and our breath has become ragged. 

“Now… Now I'm fired up. It's your fault for making me feel this… hot inside. And remember, you said you accepted every part of me, so take responsibility…” She says while panting, as she lowers herself on me to have a feel of my lips once more, clearly unsatisfied with tasting them twice.

“I'll always take responsibility, if it's for you.” I respond right before she shuts me up with her own mouth. The two of us embrace each other as we make out with a fiery passion, never letting go. It's almost as if we're scared that the moment we let our lover out of our grasp, they'll be taken from us.

As this is happening, a certain spot in my pants begins to grow, indicating my current state of excitement. Neru, gently grinding on me, takes notice, and starts focusing more on said spot.

“Hm~? What's this hard spot down here poking near my thighs? Do I… Make you THIS happy?” She teases, making me blush gently, as the red hue on her cheeks spreads like mine. 

“You're the only one who'd be able to make me like this, but I think you know that already~” I tease back, prompting her to go for the zipper of my pants.

“I'm glad~” She says with a low, sultry voice as she reveals my raging member, and removing my shirt. She goes back for my lips as she positions her hips over mine, shifting her panties to her sides and revealing her incredibly wet slit. My tip touching her entrance.

As we're exchanging saliva, she quickly lowers herself on me, impaling herself with my Binah. She rocks her head backwards as she gasps for air, all the while adjusting her hips, likely trying to get comfortable with the unknown feeling of fullness.
 
“F-fuck… You feel… Way to good, Sensei…” She whispers in between small pauses, as she starts slowly rocking her hips. 

“I could… Say the same about you…” I retort, with labored breaths. She then takes my hands, intertwining our fingers, and begins moving up and down, repeating this cycle gently. 

This goes on for a minute. After which she starts picking up the pace, having accustomed to the pleasure. As she picks up the pace, she pins my arms above me with one hand, and puts the other on my shoulder, to refrain me from moving or taking the lead. She keeps going like this for a few minutes, bouncing up and down in with an hypnotic swaying of her hips.

As if it wasn't enough, she starts nibbling on my now sensitive neck, pleasuring me even further, as I can feel myself reaching the point of no return.

“Haah… Haah… I’m close, Sensei… Finish with me, please…” She says with her head on my chest, accelerating her movements.

“I'm close, too…!” I respond, feeling the knot in my lower body start to loosen. 

“Sensei… Sensei…Do it inside!”

“Neru…Neru!”

The two of us finally feel our knots come undone, as my seed finally permeates her insides. She does the same, making her juices fall all over my already drenched pelvis. The two of us take a moment to regain our breath before speaking up. 

“T-that was amazing…” I say shakily, recovering from the plentiful pleasure received in the last few minutes. 

Neru however, stays silent. At first, I'm confused as to why, but when I see the look on her face, I realize what is going on. She had the look of a beast in heat. 

“Who said we were done…?” She says seductively as she begins rocking her hips again. My expression devolves into one of horror. 

“W-wait, Neru! I'm still sensitive, I jus-!” I try, but she shuts me up quickly with her hand. I try to get up, or at the very least attempt to take the lead, but she keeps me immobile with her superhuman strength. I didn't mind, but I would've liked a moment to rest.

She keeps going roughly, all the while whispering my name with need, as I do the equivalent, and I already feel myself climbing the hill of pleasure. As is if it weren't enough stimulation before, to muffle her cries of pleasure she bites down on my neck, clearly leaving a mark that I'll have to explain the day after to anyone who sees me. This causes me to groan as she now holds me in a tight embrace as we keep up our lovemaking, her nails digging into my skin, marking me further. I put my now free arms behind her back and pull her closer as we finally begin feeling ourselves reaching the summit of pleasure. 

“Again, fill me again…!” She shouts in an uncharacteristic need, and I oblige. 

“Here it comes…!” I say as I paint her inner walls anew, and she soaks me further. Finally satisfied, she removes herself from me, and lays herself over my chest, looking at me.
 
“I… May have gone a bit overboard…” She whispers, likely embarassed at her lack of restraint during our intimate moment. I laugh gently at her bashful display. 

“A bit? I'll have to explain all the marks you put on me!” I exaggerate as I put my hand over her head, and begin to pet her slowly. 

“Can you blame me?! This was the first time I've ever felt something like this… Seeing you so… happy, made want to make you enjoy it more. Even if it meant putting some… marks on you.” She shouts, admitting her true feelings. Her blush is very noticeable, as she nuzzles her face into my hand, allowing me to caress her cheeks. 

“Well, it worked. I don't think I would've felt anything this good otherwise.” I reassure her, as I gaze back up to the night sky, still shining bright with the miriad of stars. Neru does the same. 

We keep laying on the ground for a while, talking about stars and such. A bit later, I speak up. 

“I have something for you, Neru.” I say, as I take out the small box from the left pocket of my pants. It's a golden ring, with her name engraved on the inside. I show it to her, and she starts crying tears of joy. 

“You… No way…Does this mean what I think it means…?” She asks incredulous, as the tears keep flowing. 

“Will you marry me, Neru?” 

“And you're actually asking?! Obviously, you idiot! I accept…!” She exclaims joyfully, as the tears don't stop falling. I take her ring finger, and put the ring on. 

“I love you more than anything in this world, Neru.”

“And I… I love you more than anything in this universe, my dear husband.”",15,1735093810.0,SenseisKitchen,2,1.0,True
1hlryt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1hlryt0/giddy_up_for_a_long_post/,Giddy up for a long post.,"Here I am; almost ten years into a relationship with a man. Feeling unfulfilled, unloved, needing something more, and I suggest us finding a third. He says yes, no problems there, we trust each other and we have no issues. 

I start talking to this cute girl, she’s well aware I have a boyfriend. She’s saying all the right things. Doing all the right things. Making me feel like I own the entire world and nothing can stop me. We talk about how we were looking for a third, she says she totally down, she just feels like it would take her more time to get comfortable with the boyfriend than with me. I’m like okay yeah that’s totally cool. 

A couple weeks turns into a month, we have sex for the first time without my ten year partner. She is still saying and doing all the right things, always showing up for me, making sure I’m good, bringing me coffee, buying me lunch, bringing me cards, etc.  then she tells me, she’s not okay with the boyfriend. She doesn’t want any part of that. I’m like okay, well I’ll talk to the boyfriend and see how he feels about me having a girlfriend and see if she changes her mind later (dumb of me, I know idk why I thought that) but she came into this knowing I had a boyfriend and he wasn’t going anywhere. 

So, she starts making up issues with my boyfriend. Saying he’s inconsiderate and he doesn’t treat me well, etc etc. which, the second part was a lie but she kept saying he wasn’t intentionally doing things to piss her off. So, she decides to break up with me. I’m distraught. This is the best I’ve been treated in 5 years, right? I’m in shambles. I’m saying “you said you’d never make me choose” blah blah blah. We don’t talk for a few days, and then we end up talking and getting back together a few days later. A week or two goes by and she does it again. 

Now, I’m over here thinking… well she’s right, my boyfriend doesn’t treat me well, why would I stay with him? When I could just be happy with her?? So her and I talked and I decided that I was going to leave him. So I told him I was done. But again, she became insecure and broke up with me again… and said she was done talking to me. So I decided to make it work with my boyfriend. She decided to tell me “I knew you would do this the whole time, that’s why I ended things.” So I just stopped talking to her. 

But I started missing her so much, missing that feeling. Yall know the feeling. The fucking feeling of being so in love it’s intoxicating. Idk how they do it. And the next part I TAKE FULL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR!! I went out of town with my best friend and came back and immediately had to work, after work instead of going home to my boyfriend, I went to her house… I cheated on my boyfriend. I KNOW IM A POS for it. Spare me please. I told my boyfriend, and he ofc wants to separate. I do not blame him. She wants to get back together, but as we’ve talked about many of times, we just don’t work. My boyfriend and I decided we were going to work it out, but he kept accusing me of things I wasn’t doing. I couldn’t handle it anymore, so I told him I thought we should split up. 

She messaged me saying ALL the right things again, and I told her that I wanted to just be friends and take things slow, I told her that I wanted to go with the flow and see how things went. And she agreed that that would be best for us. We ended up messing around, nothing crazy, but still maintaining those boundaries. She kept saying she wanted to get things right this time. She was going to give me time to grieve my ten year relationship and be easy on me, then the next day, she was cold to me. 

I asked her if she was okay and she said yeah she just had a long conversation with her friend. I asked her how that went and she said that they decided that they were going to be together…. I was shocked… what happened to her only loving me? Me being the love of her life? She can’t live without me? What happened to that? 

I know that it’s just how things are, I’m processing things each and every day, but it still hurts. Every day. 

In between all these times she’s getting me cards telling me how much she loves me, getting me gifts, talking to me, remembering little things I tell her. But the longer we’re together the more she stops asking about me and only talking about herself. I should’ve noticed the red flags. But I was so happy feeling something other than alone I just couldn’t think straight. Point of the post is to say, I’m 3 days no contact, I’m sad, I’m mad, I’m hurt, one minute I want to freak out, the next I want to reach out, the next I’m telling myself it’s going to be a repetitive cycle. Thank you guys for being here for me. ",1,1735093759.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False
1hlryaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/VanLife/comments/1hlryaw/i_love_dirtbaggers/,I love dirtbaggers,"I was not dirtbagging it, but I love you dirtbaggers. I used my electric car to travel. I was able to charge at slow chargers for free overnight while I slept. People are not only surprised to know that EVs are more affordable than teslas, but that I took my EV to several parks, planning routes by charger, taking roads through nowhere for obscure stations. Thanks to CoolWorks seasonal jobs I have been able to afford to travel to other states.

Loneliness. Rarely will I complain about the heat or cold - smoking cigarettes will do that for you too, when you need to be outside. Roads I will never remember. Long stretches of Utah, little towns with rainy parking lots and trees with orange in the distance. A lot of roads in Utah are named something like Ghost but aren't even haunted. Utah has so many colors. Truck stops in Utah are the prettiest I've seen.

The snow seemed so bright and shiny in Colorado in the sun. The winding mountains swept my thoughts away. The hills were rich with red in Gypsum where the name of the town came from. At least as I was told. Best seasonal job I took was in Colorado.

A desert has a quiet dignity while granite mountains seem to reflect both an ancient and innocent beauty. I have driven mindlessly through the mojave desert until the heat bleached my brain clean. I found an old laundry machine riddled with bullet holes and empty rounds all over the dust on a random hike.

Driving up and down the hills of green in Flagstaff where rain would come suddenly, the greenest place in Arizona. Flagstaff felt so huge and high up. And I love the way the rain seemed to slant in the Grand Canyon, coming at us sideways, the thick mud that stuck to my boots.

The raw beauty of a landscape after rubbing your eyes before the sunset to crack your back in your cold car: coughing like shotgunning a red bull. Lots of cold stony dirty bathrooms without toilet paper that smelled of shit and piss. I must have smelled bad too. The trails I walked alone to think around the trees even if I had no one to share the morning with. I do not even know how long I have looked off into the mountains and cried good and cleansing. The joy of someone climbing a mountain is like the grin of ""I just got laid.""

Thank you for reading this far

And being prepared with your own toilet paper to shit in old porta potties. A car must always have fast food napkins and disposable utensils. You learn to know your own odor. A hot car is still a place for you to sleep that's safer than the street. You smell like feet and a little like piss. Curling up naked in the hot backseat in the blank beige somewhere outside Vegas on shrooms, lights from semi flashing over the mountains like a theater. Waking up sweaty in a cloudless Nevada nothingness, McDonalds iced coffee.

When I am looking at the sky I am not only staring off into space - I am selfish and I want to look at the sunset. If I wasted my time looking off into space, the clouds weren't wasting their time.

Thanks for reading, it's okay to laugh at me, just sharing my thoughts

If you're dirtbagging it right now, thanks for being who you are

I just don't have it in me to write up the whole thing rn. I'm in my 50s and about at the end of my rope with insomnia issues. It has ruined my career and my financial situation. Lack of sleep is aging my body and my mind. 

I currently take alprazalom at night to sleep. I don't get supremely restful sleep but it's better than nightmares, anxiety, and no sleep. I've tried many (a dozen and a half or so) other meds over the years. The only ones I've been able to take with any success are Valium and alprazalomalprazalom. I hate that my entire life is ruled by the fact that I have to take sleep meds and go to sleep early so I can get up and function for work. Very little flexibility in my sleep schedule. Anyway, I'm sure that I'm far from the only one here that feels this way so here is my actual question.

Typically, if I wake up really early, I end up eventually just getting up, making coffee, sitting on my meditation cushion until it's time to function. Every once in a while, I put in my earbuds and fall back to sleep listening to some yoga nidra or meditation music. It never fails, though, that I feel even more exhausted when I wake up again and hour or two later. I end up basically non-functional, as I do if I forget to take my sleep meds. It happened this morning. I was just too tired to get up at 4am today so went back to sleep to some yoga nidra. Spent all day watching re-runs, with chest pains and feeling like absolute crap. I had things to do! If it was a work day, I'd have had to call in sick.

Generally, I believe that I get my deepest sleep in the early morning because I often feel that when I wake up between 3 and 5 that I’m being pulled out of a dreamdream. Not sure if that matters. Just mentioning it in case it is a factor. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Why do I feel worse for having gone back to sleep??

* Broke up with my recent ex 9 months ago. I was the dumper, we were both in a rut for a few months and trying to work on things but things kept getting more strained so I ended it. She and I are in mutual friend groups and were friends for a few months before dating.
* When I ended it, I said I want to go no contact for at least a month or two just to have some distance. After two months, we spoke again. She wanted to have a big clear the air conversation. I was nervous about it but agreed on the condition that we'd air everything out in this one meeting and anything else that comes up after we deal with on our own. It ended up being a very long and painful conversation.
* She asked if we could try to be friends. Since we were friends before, I said we could try but it'd have to be baby steps. I also told her I had no intention of getting back together and she said she understood. We went on a walk once and had a few phone conversations, very quickly I realized there were too many emotions on my side and I couldn't handle it. So I went to her in person and said I wasn't mad but I couldn't handle anything 1:1. I said I'd say hi in group settings, but we should work through our emotions on our own. She agreed and revealed that she'd secretly been hoping to get back together the whole time. I was hurt by this but didn't mention that because it seemed irrelevant now that I was already ending the friendship.
* In the few months after that she would reach out every now and then. If it was something appropriate (like ""hey can I have one of those merch water bottles from the organization we're both part of""), I would be responsive. If it was a text just to make conversation, I usually wouldn't respond. One time she texted to clear the air about something a friend was supposedly saying about me. I respectfully told her I thought that wasn't appropriate to talk about and I reiterated I couldn't handle 1:1 conversations.
* I saw her at a party a few months later. I was anxious being around her, but I tried to power through and have a conversation with her. It was pretty normal, nothing bad happened, but still felt weird the whole time. Later that night she comes up to me to say goodbye and asks if I want to get coffee or something sometime. I tell her no, it's too hard, but she keeps asking for more details and keeps being persistent. I just keep saying no, even bringing up the fact that I heard she has a new boyfriend and it wouldn't be appropriate for us to hang out. I felt really uncomfortable after that and blocked her phone number so I wouldn't be tempted to reach out and blow up at her.
* Two months later she texts me on a group messaging app saying she's hurt that I find it hard to be around her and that she's still hopeful we will be friends. By this point I was sick of repeating myself so I just didn't reply.
* A few weeks later we are again in a big group setting together. This time, I felt really anxious around her so I just didn't approach her for conversation. We kinda ignored each other the whole time until everyone is leaving and we say hi and exchange pleasantries.
* The following weekend I come back home to find an old book I lent her and a letter on my door. It's from her just basically saying she doesn't know if I still care about her, it's clear I don't want her in my life, and that she's letting go of all attachments to me. I thought that was a fair, if painful, thing to communicate, but the letter goes on to say how she senses a deep sadness within me just by looking at me. She says she's had a wonderful year and found herself again and hopes I find myself. 
* I felt like those last things were unnecessarily hurtful to say considering she doesn't know what's going on in my life. I wouldn't guess whether she's doing good or bad because I don't know either. I tried not to do anything toward her out of spite, but I knew having distance would be the only way I could move on so I tried to communicate that. I'm just so confused by her letter and behavior so maybe one of you can help give me perspective. Or if it sounds like I've been the cruel one, please tell me.",2,1735092335.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1hlrl1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1hlrl1t/a_chess_tool_to_help_you_avoid_blunders/,A Chess Tool to Help You Avoid Blunders,"# Background

We all know that to avoid blunders in chess, one crucial approach is to perform multiple checks: before making an actual move, we need to analyze our opponent's attacking intentions and confirm whether we have means of attack and counterattack.

However, playing rapid chess for a long time has led me to develop a bad habit of moving pieces before thinking, often completing moves before analyzing all possible variations. In this state, I frequently make basic mistakes and subsequently lose games.

To overcome this issue, I created a small tool: when it's your turn, this tool prevents you from controlling the chess pieces. You must complete six check items before you can operate the board. This way, I am forced to complete the checks before making a move. I've used this tool in my practice over the past two days and found it quite effective, so I'm sharing it with everyone, hoping it helps those who face similar struggles.

After using this tool for a while, I won **12 games in a row**! (The elo is a bit low because I only played chess for two weeks 🥹)

# Demo

# Preliminary Notes

* Currently only supports the web version of chess.com
   * If you want to use this tool on other websites, leave a comment below, and I'll work on compatibility support for other sites when time permits
* There might be minor bugs
   * Since I developed this tool casually, I'm not certain if it works perfectly in all scenarios. Therefore, I personally recommend using it only when playing against computers to avoid any unexpected situations that might affect your performance. (By the way, I think playing against computers is indeed a good way to develop the habit of checking before moving, as we don't need to worry about time constraints)

Currently in a rs for 2+yrs but i think my gf is emotionally unintelligent. We had a rough start but nging ok nman. Evrytime may away (na dpat hndi nman) na xa nag sstart bcos di nia nagustuhan ngawa ko, simpleng bagay na nkalimutan na nbanggit na nia pla to, since ayaw nia ng paulit ulit ang lala nia magalit. Recent na away is naglambing ako ilibre nia ko sa coffee shop. She did then umupo xa sa high chair then binigay na ng barista ung coffee for takeaway. Gsto nia bumaba kso mxado mataas ung chair so ako, im waiting na alalayan xa pero sumigaw xa na ako na nga nilibre, nkasimangot pa ko. I dont know san galing na nkasimangot ako and mas gsto nia na dpat ung drink ung ipriority ko. Dun sumama loob ko ksi pinahiya nia ko sa lakas ng boses nia. Pauwi sknla d ko xa kinikibo till dumating sknla nag ayos pa kmi mga pinamili nia. Then nung kinagabihan, dhil bigat na ng saloobin ko, i told her d ko nagustuhan ung gnwa nia. Im crying sa dismaya na bkit gnon nkkipag heart to heart talk ako pero since nsa labas kami ng bahay  nilalaro nia ung cat and dog na nsa tabi nmen. Wala ung attention nia sken. Told her ill go home and bfore pa pla mag start ung heart to heart talk e nagsabi ako na mag angkas nlng ako pauwi. Nung nagsabi na ko uuwi na ko, nag book xa and may rider na pero sobrang sama ng loob ko na wala ngyare sa pag sabi ko ng feelings ko sknya. Nag walk out ako at hinabol nia ko pra pisilin ung braso ko at glit na glit xa. Got home and saw na im blocked sa lahat pero ung last chat nia is kinansel nia ung angkas and if malakas daw ba trip ko sa pag walkout at dinadamay ko pa daw ung nagttrabaho lng. I txted her saying mga hinanakit ko pa din and buti pa si rider, concern xa. Di kmi nag usap ng 2 days then knina nagkausap kami. Asked her if nkuha nia ung txt ko. Sabi nia hndi since pati don blocked ako. Ang sakit kase wala xang pake. 

Share ko lng den sa whole rs na to, sobrang takot ako mag share sknya ng concerns, or feelings ko ksi nauuwi sa argument. Tkot ako mag ask ng help sknya since sinusumbat nia. I think msama loob nia na nagpalibre ako ng coffee kya nagalit. Sa start ng rs, i didnt leave her na nag sstart pa lang xa sa work till nag resign xa, naging VA sa agency then nkahanap ng direct client. Im happy sa naaachieve nia pero simula ng tumaas na sahod nia than me, prang ang baba na ng tingin nia sken. Lagi pa cause ng away is gstong gsto nia ko umalis sa work ko. I promise yall im looking for a job, but hndi nman ako kaagad nttanggap. Shes helping me nman kso nssumbat nga. Nagsshare xa ng mga posts aside sa nghhnap din ako. Na worried lmg daw xa sa future and if ano ssabihin ng family nia smen and if ano papakain ko sknya. Financially wala kami prob, i know na gsto lang nia mging secure ung future nia pero kht kkmatay lang ng mom ko 3months ago, aun ang away nmin. Pasalamat pa ko ksi di daw nia ko kinukulit pa nung kkmatay lng ni mama. Im doing interview pa while nsa burol. Still, till now wala pa din ako nallipatan na work coz gsto nia din ako mag VA. For me dhil lht ng tao sa ofc kinakaselosan nia or galit xa sa mga taong nkapaligid skin kya gsto nia ko umalis. I isolated myself pag nsa ofc ako. Wala ko kht sinong may nggstuhan sa ofc na kht anong assurance ko, wala nman sknya. Sa lahat ng lakad nmen, bilang lang sa daliri ang pag aambag nia ng gas (car). Hndi ako naninigil. Hndi ko sinusumbat, dito ko lng sinasabi. Physically, emotionally abused. Mmurahin ako katakot takot, mag wwalk out. Lht nman yn ilang beses ko na sinabi wag nia gawin but still ngyayare pa din. Mraming times na nkklimot din xa ng nga updates ko sa buhay pero inuulit ko lng sknya unlike her na magwwala xa. 
Di ko na alam ano pa ggawin pra iplease xa.gsto ko na makipag break mmya since magkkita kmi. Salamat po sa pagbasa.",3,1735091839.0,OffMyChestPH,2,1.0,False

Would love some help figuring out what color/type of coffee table and rug would go with [this sofa](https://www.raymourflanigan.com/living-rooms/sofas/diego-leather-sofa-202097110).

For context, the floor of the living room is a light, beachy oak color. Walls are an [off white](https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-colors/color/oc-45/swiss-coffee). Our dining table & chairs are this [light bamboo IKEA set](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/voxloev-dining-table-light-bamboo-40434322/). So, at the moment, it kind of has a bohemian or maybe even beachy vibe to it. However, the one part of the room that breaks it up is the accent wall, which is black with warm brown wood paneling on it (right across from the sofa). [Here's an example](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c7/ec/7c/c7ec7c47390885614c5febc97bcdb702.jpg) I found online that matches the coloring we have.

I'm thinking it might be good to get some warm browns into the coffee table to bridge the gap between all the light colors and the accent wall color, but let me know what you think!

I stacked up on some NAC, ALA, CoQ1, C and Taurine.

So there I sit in panic. Heart racing. Warmth flowing over me. My past trauma awaits the black out sensations and squeezed chest and I'm plotting how to make my way to the ER that is 20 mins away.

The other symptoms never came, but I am pretty sure I worked myself into some induced state of panic.

The waves flowed over me in the coming hours.
 Each peaking a bit lower than the previous one.

I was quite sure I was going to have a very catastrophic day there for a while.

Hello! I'm Mercedes, a 5'11 big girl who's looking for a new connection.

I'm married to my long-term partner (NB27) and engaged to my fiancé (M31) but I'm looking for something new!

Some of my interests: 
Board games (like a huge variety), cats, music, crystals, tattoos, piercings, unhinged memes, TikTok, coffee/energy drinks and reading (horror and smut specifically) 

About me:
I have brown hair typically but I do love dying my hair. Hazel eyes that get called pretty often. I'm a hopeless romantic who loves to cuddle, go on cute dates, send sweet memes/TikToks, I'm loyal and empathetic (almost to a fault), I cannot stand dry conversations, I tend to wear shorts and t-shirts because they're comfy. I'm not religious and very liberal. I'm also a mom! 

What I'm looking for: 
I would love someone who will let me be clingy, respond in a timely manner (or let me know that you're away/busy), have a dark sense of humor, and is open and honest, I tend to prefer thick body types but I'm more into your personality. 

I'm currently looking for online and long-term, but I'd love some new friends, and would be interested in-person if we hit it off, dms are open! ♥️ ",2,1735090911.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

1hlr6z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanExpat/comments/1hlr6z7/can_you_meet_people_in_your_city_with_the/,Can You Meet People In Your City With The TimeLeft App?,"Recently, I learned about a new app called ""TimeLeft"". TimeLeft organizes dinners for 5-6 strangers and gives you an opportunity to get to know new people. I decided to give it a try. I bought a 3 month subscription for 50 euros, which signs me up to attend 4 dinners per month for 3 months.  Once there, you just pay for anything you consume. You have a choice of signing up for meetings in English or the local language or both. I selected meetings in English.  
I have attended 4 dinners, below is my experience with each. 

The first dinner only 3 people showed up. Me a woman and a guy. For some reason, two of the people who were supposed to attend did not make it. We met in a upper end sushi restaurant which I had never visited before. I enjoyed the place and I enjoyed the people. In fact, I am still in contact with the one woman I met there and I have even helped her change apartments.

The second dinner did not go as expected because when we arrived, we found there was no table reserved for us. It is a very popular restaurant mentioned in the Michelin guide.  Later I discovered that the restaurant had cancelled the reservation, but the organizers of TimeLeft did not get the message and we particjpants were left with no table.  One of the participants immediately left and two of us went to another restaurants and had a pretty good time.

The third was a group of 7 people, 4 women and 3 men. It was the biggest group by far and very interesting. The discussions were lively and interesting. It was in a restaurant that I know well. I enjoyed the dinner alot.

I mentioned TimeLeft to a friend of mine and he signed up as well. The fourth meeting, he and I were in the same group, which makes me wonder if there is only 1 English table per week in our city.  There were 2 women and 4 men, one of the men was quite intense, which make the discussion a bit stressful for me. The meeting was in a local restaurant that I know well. Afterwards 4 of us connected up and are planning to meet again for coffee next weekend.

What is my conclusion? Overall, TimeLeft is a good way for expats to meet people, both locals and foreigners. It is not meant as a ""dating app"", and indeed many of the participants were married and were just looking to expand their social circles. But there were also single people there and of course, it is a resource if you are interested in finding a partner as well. TimeLeft is experiencing ""growing pains"" which resulted in us arriving to no table reservations. I heard from another participant at one of my dinners that it happened to him as well. I am hoping that with time, the experience improves.  Would I do it again? Absolutely. In fact, when my 3 month subscription runs out, I expect I will do a 6 month subscription for 70 euros. I think it is a bargain at that price.

Sustainable Practices in Woodcraft: How Local Artisans are Making a Difference in the Triangle Area
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Triangle Area – encompassing Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill – a remarkable shift towards sustainable practices in woodcraft is taking place. Local artisans are leading the charge, promoting eco-friendly methods that not only respect the environment but also enhance the quality and uniqueness of their products. You might be curious about how these artisans are making a difference. Let’s dive into the ways they are implementing sustainable practices while crafting beautiful wood pieces.

One of the fundamental approaches to sustainable woodcraft in this region is the use of locally sourced materials. Many woodworkers opt for wood from nearby forests, ensuring that transportation emissions are minimized. This practice also supports the local economy, benefiting landowners and ensuring that forests remain healthy through responsible harvesting. You can often find artisans using hardwoods like oak, maple, or cherry that are sourced locally, which not only preserves environmental integrity but also adds character to the final products.

Check The Details for 160,000 wood working plans Here: https://tedswoodworking.myofferdeals.com  
  
Many artisans in the area employ reclaimed wood in their creations. This practice reduces waste by repurposing wood that might otherwise be discarded. It’s not uncommon to see craftsmen using old barn wood, shipping pallets, or dismantled furniture to create stunning new pieces. The charm of reclaimed wood lies in its history; each piece carries a story, adding depth to the handcrafted items. These are just a few advantages of using reclaimed wood:

- Reduces deforestation by minimizing the need for newly harvested trees.
- Helps divert waste from landfills.
- Adds unique textures and colors to finished products.

In addition to sourcing materials locally or using reclaimed wood, many artisans are adopting eco-friendly finishes and adhesives. Traditional finishes often contain harmful chemicals that can be detrimental to both the environment and human health. Many craftspeople now choose natural oils, beeswax, or water-based varnishes as alternatives. These options not only help lessen the environmental impact but also ensure that the products are safe for homes, especially where children and pets are present.

The Triangle’s artisans also emphasize educating their customers about the importance of sustainable woodcraft. By sharing their processes and the rationale behind their choices, they inspire a greater appreciation for handmade products and eco-conscious living. Workshops, community events, and social media platforms have become popular for these artisans to engage with their audience. Sharing insights into their craft helps promote a culture of sustainability in the entire community.

Another innovative approach gaining traction among local woodworkers is crafting multi-functional furniture and decor. Instead of creating single-purpose items, artisans design products that serve numerous functions, reducing the need for multiple purchases. For example, a beautiful coffee table can also serve as a storage unit, or a bench can convert into seating for guests. This not only benefits consumers by providing versatile products but also helps minimize waste and resource consumption over time.

The Triangle Area’s woodcraft scene is enriched by collaboration among artisans. Many local woodworkers team up with designers, builders, and even chefs to create unique pieces that reflect the area’s culture. These collaborations often lead to innovative designs that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional. When artisans work together, they also amplify the message of sustainability, creating soothing connections to nature and community.

With the growing awareness surrounding sustainability, customers are increasingly seeking “green” products. Artisans in Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill are responding by ensuring their work not only meets aesthetic demands but also aligns with eco-friendly principles. By choosing sustainable woodcraft, consumers contribute to a healthier environment while supporting local craftspeople.

This shift toward sustainable practices in woodcraft is truly making a difference in the Triangle Area. The commitment of local artisans to responsible sourcing, eco-friendly finishes, and community engagement showcases how creativity can merge with sustainability. You, too, can be a part of this movement by purchasing from local artisans and advocating for environmentally-friendly practices.

As the demand for sustainable furniture and decor continues to rise, the woodcraft community in Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill is poised to lead the way. With each handmade piece, artisans not only create something beautiful but also inspire change and demonstrate that sustainable practices can be woven into every aspect of creativity. The commitment to the environment is as strong as the wood they craft into art, and together, they are building a brighter, greener future.

1hlquwb,https://v.redd.it/qwljoltgbw8e1,QEP (Quarantine Enforcement Platform) Moonpool Base,"I built this in creative, but i plan on building this in my survival world.

I REALLY like how smooth the prawn moonpool dock is. I dont even need to boost up, i just walk under and get grabbed.

Speaking of being grabbed, the scanner room will be useful to see where the reapers are so i dont get grabbed. Will also help in finding the close ones so i can kill them. The holographic display of the island looks AWESOME too.

I also really like the “common” room things. The way the room is set, i have everything i need. The aquarium is super nice as well, and i really like how the walls smoothly connect, so its like theres kinda a glass window that curves inward. 

The vending machines and coffee machine were meant to just take up space so it doesnt seem empty, but they fit well.

The water and food room (i will plant marblemelons in the wall planters and lantern trees in the pots) is also nice. The 5 water filtration machines will take lots of energy, but i have 35 thermal plants, so i will be fine. (Link to post with the power stuff will be at the end).

I think the planters on top of the multipurpose rooms are genius. Since theyre out of water, ill be able to plant land flora like bulbo trees, chinese potato, marblemelon, lantern trees, and other less useful but pretty plants. 

The planters on the moonpools are self explanatory, for water plants. Things like acid mushrooms and creepvine since im far from them.

Another smooth feature of this base i really like is the above water hatches. I just love how i can exit, and immediately step on land. And its not like i fall down or anything, i step directly on the perfect level.

Some things i dont like is that fact that the above water level hatches dont have the bulkhead and stairs. I believe that the devs programmed it so that the hatches change only when the depth meter reads 0, which it doesnt here. 

Another thing that bothers me is the fact that its skewed from the center of the qep moonpool. Its not that big of a deal for my test world, but i really like symmetry (as can be seen in the design of my base.)

“You see, I’m not small. I guess I’m pretty average but some might call me above average in the size department. I’m 5’6” and a chubby size 14. Like most women, I float through feeling comfortable and uncomfortable with my size. Unlike most women, I’ve been open to dating men on the shorter side—but 5’2” was a range I’d never ventured into.”

“We took off like a rocket. We quickly fell in love and made plans to meet in person. In casual conversation, he mentioned that he wore a size 28 jean.”

“I’m going to split him in two and kill him,” I shared with a good friend about that particular factoid.”

“In reality, when we met, our bodies fit together like the peas and carrots of our personalities and that was that. It was easy, and perfect.”

“We recently completed a three-week whirlwind tour across four states in a car. We slept in seven different beds, soaked in three bathtubs together, rode in my car and navigated all kinds of crowds.”

“I came home and contemplated some of the benefits of being with this gorgeous man who stands tall four inches lower than me.”

“I figured I’d give the shorter-than-average fellas a shout-out and a little encouragement to the ladies to reconsider this “I could never date a man whose butt is smaller than mine” thing. Here are some added perks that come with the smaller guy that only someone who’d lived it might discover:

1. Bed space relations.

We slept in so many different sized beds and could comfortably be in every one, without having to spoon all the time either. We could each have our own breathing room in a double bed and realized that we will easily navigate that lower bunk in the train trip we intend to take for our honeymoon.

2. Bathtub navigation.

Slipping into a tub and into the arms of your man easily without overflowing the room is a moment of joy. Then you realize you can even move around in there trying different shapes and positions together with ease. Additional space adds to that intimacy.

3. Crowd cruising.

Smaller men get used to slipping through crowds almost unnoticed. My love would grab my hand and I’d flow right along behind him as he sourced our way from the back to the front like water in a stream. The next thing I knew we were outside on our way to the car.

4. Personality.

Shorter guys often didn’t have it so easy in adolescence simply for that one physical factor. If they wanted to be popular or fit in, they would have to work just a little extra in the personality department. You often find the jovial, fun-loving, funny, life-of-the-party guys in shorter altitudes. This makes for great conversation and fun.

5. Industriousness.

It’s not fair, but things don’t come as easy to the shorter guys as, say, the 6’3” quarterback. My fiancé is the most hardworking, energetic man I’ve ever been with. On our trip, he did all the laundry, helped me un-decorate my entire house after Christmas and brought me coffee every morning although he doesn’t drink it himself. I’ll leave it up to your imagination what this looks like in the bedroom.

6.  Presence.

People who’ve met my fiancé don’t believe that he’s four inches shorter than me. He’s developed a larger-than-life presence. He doesn’t slouch and projects such a positive, palpable energy that it makes him appear much higher in stature.

7.  Confidence.

I leave this for last because it’s the most important trait of all. Shorter men have often had to dig deeper in order to reach and develop that inner confidence women find so sexy. I asked my man, “Have you ever felt insecure about your height?” to which he replied, “Never.” It shows. He exudes a quiet confidence which, I think, is the sexiest trait in a man.

Ladies, I encourage you to open that vertical lens a little wider and go deeper as you gaze into the dating pool. I’ve never felt as protected, loved, nurtured or as much of a woman as I have with this man who looks up to kiss me.

And let’s face it: when you’re lying side-by-side in bed having that delicious post-love-making pillow talk, everyone is the same height.

1hlqsa0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1hlqsa0/how_do_you_actually_get_out_of_bed_in_the_morning/,How DO you actually get out of bed in the morning? I have a massive struggle and need to change,"So, I’m F28 and I have had insomnia all my life. Some of my earliest memories are laying awake at night, knowing my parents want me to sleep, and just being unable to do that. As a result, I have been having severe issues getting out of bed in the morning, also for as long as I can remember. Even at almost 30, I continue to oversleep, have super messy mornings, arrive last minute,… I feel so embarrassed about this but NOTHING helps.

**Here are things that I have tried to combat the insomnia:**

- I have tried since childhood to have a healthy and continuous nighttime routine. I would get ready for bed always the same way, do something calm and relaxing, and then go to bed at an age-appropriate, reasonable time. When smartphones became a thing I limited my screen time. When I was introduced to caffeine drinks, I didn’t have any in the afternoon or evening. And so on. Anything that could get in the way of healthy sleep, I didn’t do. Still, I lay awake for hours and hours, and I just cannot sleep.
- I have also tried medication under doctoral administration (and, where necessary, sleep supervision). Over the years, doctors tried me on a large variety of meds from different angles (anything from sleep medication to anti-depressants). All of them did either nothing or had severe adverse effects or side effects. Melatonin also didn’t help (and yes, I did use it the right way, as discussed with my doctor).
- I have had therapy to deal with some underlying issues. It has helped a lot in many ways and improved my life significantly, but the insomnia remains unchanged.

I have at this point mentally given up on the idea that I might ever not have insomnia, and am working on accepting it.

**Here are things that I have tried to get out of bed:**

- All of the alarm clocks: Radio alarm clock (didn’t work), sunrise alarm clock (worked for about a week), alarm clock in a different room (worked also for about a week), alarmy to force me to do math and take a certain amount of steps (my sleep-deprived ass figured out how to disable/trick it, I will not tell you how so I don’t ruin it for other users, also I can do complex math in my sleep now), any combination of these. Always, after about a week, my brain has figured out how to beat the system and I do it before I am even awake enough to realize what is happening. Even if I switch up the order or places of things, I will turn everything off and find myself back in bed before I gain proper consciousness.
- Support from loved ones: My Mom used to bring some coffee or tea to my bed in the morning and now my wonderful partner does the same. I deeply appreciate it, but… First of all, it doesn’t wake me up. And more importantly, I feel awful relying on someone else to do something so basically functional that even a child can do on their own.
- Having pets rely on me: I have two cats and thought that them needing me in the morning to be fed should be a valid reason to activate my brain. Apparently, and I am ashamed to say that, it isn’t. I have slept through my alarms, including subconsciously getting up to turn them off, more than three hours over my cats’ feeding time.

So once in a while I see people asking for tips for getting the medium CAs done. A lot of the usual tips are to just check for completion on the wiki and follow along, but I think a more comprehensive guide could be of help. So here is how I did it as a complete beginner at RuneScape. The order is completely up to you, except the first step, which enables some of the later CAs

**Chaos Elemental (13 points)**

The reason for going here early is that one of the drops is a weapon poison++, which will help a ton on some of the later CAs. For all kills I used the safe spot from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FFMwZkB32w&ab_channel=EastHants) guide. The tasks for this boss are pretty simple. Kill it 25 times and then pray for some good rng to get the no damage achievement. the poison is a 1/13 drop, so you should have it after getting 25 kills. If not either you farm for it, or you find 7-10 points somewhere else and call it a day

**Temporos and Wintertodt (21 - 27 points)**

Since I started my account with grinding a bit of both of these bosses, I had a lot of the CAs done here. Pretty self-explanatory. I never bothered with the two hard tier achievements for Tempoross, since I got spooned on my book and barrel.

**Scurrius (8 points)**

Kill the rat until you get a spine and make it into the staff or the bow. The only tricky part about the CAs for me, was getting the method for killing 6 of the small rats in 3 seconds down. A ranged ratbane weapon helps a lot here. You want to gather the rats up, and then attack the rats furthest away first. This travel time of you projectile gives you some extra time to click the rest of the rats

**Crazy Archaeologist (9 points)**

Cheese him with the [safe spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF38gCCNsiE&ab_channel=LilratbagsOsrs) and collect points

**Giant Mole (15 points)**

This is where the poison really comes in handy. Poison damage does not count as an instance of damage for the Hard Hitter CA. So you want to hit it once, wait and see if it got poisoned and then let the poison do the work. Get a cup of coffee and have some entertainment on the second monitor and then rinse and repeat. This might take a couple attempts. This is also a great method for withering the mole down so you can kill it quickly after it resurfaces

**Barrows (14 points)**

Again we have an achievement where the weapon poison comes in handy. The CA for only killing Karil with specs does count even if most of the damage was done by poison. So spec and run behind the tomb and go back to that second monitor. For Can't Touch Me just follow the guide on the wiki (tldr: Run behind tomb right at spawn -> turn run of and freeze -> do dmg -> repeat). This helps with the 0 prayer CA too. Just bring tons of food, and you should be good.

**CoX (25 - 61  points)**

This is a big one. Lots of easy points to get even with lower combat stats. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adVcIjMGReg&t=356s&ab_channel=Extile) video has a guide for all of them. I completed Dancing with Statues, Kill It with Fire, Cryo No More, Shazien Specialist, Blizzard Dodger and No Time for Death without any issues. I also gave Mutta-diet a couple of tries, but didn't have the stats for it, so I gave up on the rest of them.

**Hespori (13 points)**

Not much to say here. The speed tasks seem pretty hard to do with low stats, so I haven't included them in the point total. Just kill it 5 times and have one of those be without using any prayers.

**Moons of Peril (9 points)**

Blood Moon is going to suck with low stats, but it is doable with D-scim and good rng. Do a full D-scim run and loot the chest for 4 points and then do a eclipse kill only attacking clones for 3 points. The last 2 points  are for opening the reward chest 5 times. you only have to kill 1 boss to loot the chest. I did Blue Moon because it was the fastest for me.

**Finishing up**

At this point you should have at least 127 points and only need 12 more to get the hilt. There are tons of easy achievements still available, so go look them up and find some you can finish quickly. A lot of monsters have kill CAs (Black Dragon, Shaman etc.). If you got lucky on some giant keys you turn them into some points. Or you could do Amoxliatl or Deranged Archaeologist.

This is probably not the fastest nor the most meta way to do it, but it worked out just fine for me. And if I can do it, so can you. Feel free to add your input in the comments. I'll try to read them all and keep the guide updated.",34,1735088788.0,ironscape,9,0.93,False

now after soldering a picofly i just wanted to share that its a pain in the ass to mod a switch if you are coming from a steamdeck which allows you to do everything on software.  
now i appreciate my linux handheld much more than ever before

but not gonna lie i like the switch  
the agility to play games on tv/table or handheld mode and being able to setting up the controllers in seconds for single or multiplayer is pretty nice.

the soab switch took me some nerves and sweat cause i didnt expected the transistors to be that small and i had not the ideal tools for the job but fortunately it worked.  
the tools i´ve been using were my pixel 6a on a coffee mug to zoom in and have a better view.  
a cheap soldering iron i've been using for 15years now.  
and sn60pb40 solder which is unfortunately not legal to buy in germany anymore

i just wanted to share that with you guys.

TLDR at the bottom

This past summer me and my boyfriend went and stayed in another city where my best friend happens to live. This is the first time they've ever met given we live so far away.

They got along really well since they both have similar personalities and are smart in the same way. To preface, my friend is flirty even in platonic relationships. She likes to hold hands, cuddle, and be physically/emotionally affectionate with everyone. I know it's not sexual/romantic so I didn't necessarily have a problem when she would cuddle with my bf, hold his hand, and other stuff. However, I started getting jealous when she would sleep in the same bed as us and place herself in the middle. I brushed it off though because I trusted her enough to know it wasn't meant to be intimate in that type of way. I also trusted my boyfriend not to overstep even if she was acting in that way.

There were a few instances that did keep bothering me. Once after a house party I had thrown, my boyfriend was drunk and needed help getting into bed. We carried him together. Once he was on the bed, she proceeded to try and take off his pants. He was wearing boxers underneath, and I understand that she was maybe just trying to care for him, but I remember having to physically remove her hand and stop her from doing so. Again, I don't think my bff meant anything sexual by it, but it felt like a boundary had been crossed. 

We also all went on a road trip together to a national park. We went on a hiking trail, and since they are both a bit more fit than I am, outpaced me and were walking together several feet ahead of me. It got to the point where I couldn't even see them. This happened for the whole trip. We also shared a motel room that night (there were two beds, my bff had her own bed and my bf and I had our own). Apparently during their walk together, he mentioned wanting to get his hair braided, and she got on our bed, sat behind him and proceeded to do so. Again, I felt weird about it, but I trusted them both. On the ride back, they talked the whole time about a niche topic I couldn't really join in about so again I third wheeled. 

After this trip, I talked to my boyfriend about feeling jealous and he insisted that I didn't have anything to worry about. That they both thought I just wanted some time alone and didn't mean anything by it. To make it short and sweet, he denied and insisted I was overthinking my jealousy until my best friend told me about the following events: 

On the last day of our trip, we all slept in the same bed again. Again, she got in the middle, but I purposefully got up and placed myself between them that night. I fell asleep fast since we all had been smoking prior. The following is a mix of what both of them told me happened: When I was asleep, she reached over and started rubbing his arm. He reached over and placed his hand on her hip and slipped his fingertips on the waistband of her shorts. She removed his hand and placed it on her stomach. That was it and they both fell asleep. In the morning, I got up before either of them and went to get coffee. During that time, my boyfriend sat my friend down and apologized for what he did. He told her that it was completely inappropriate for him to place his hand there and he's sorry for making her uncomfortable. He said that he values her friendship and would never do something like that again. She told him he appreciated his apology and that she was glad that he brought it up, so they could talk about it. When I came back, everything was fine, and they were both talking about their favorite movies. 

Her and I then went out together to hangout one last time before I left the state. She told me she wanted to have a serious conversation with me and that if we weren't on the same page, she couldn't be my friend anymore. She told me she wanted us to be in a 'Boston marriage', a platonic partnership between two women where we would have kids together via IVF with my partner being the potential sperm donor and 'father' figure to our children. She told me that it hurt her feelings to see me talking about building a future with him since I wouldn't ever explicitly mention her in those plans. We've talked about something like this before (moreso about how we always saw each other as family), but it was always in a more hypothetical context since we live across the country from one another and never had any plans of living in the same place together before. Not going to lie, I didn't want to blow up our friendship on the last day of the trip, so I agreed even though I hadn't fully processed this idea. She told me at the end of that conversation that next time she'd come to visit my partner and I we would talk about the possibility of all three of us moving and starting a family outside of the US. 

My bf and I went back to our state where we moved into our apartment together. I sort of pushed the convo with my friend to the back of my mind for a few weeks until my bf let's slip that they've been texting. I have full access to my bf's phone and looked through the conversation. He texted her first a few days after we left to ask about a movie she recommended to him. They'd consistently had conversations after that, even sending each other voice messages. Side note: my bff has never even texted me with that much substance, we usually talk on the phone every few weeks, so this was really surprising for me. 

I confronted my bf about it and again he told me that I had nothing to worry about. He even offered to stop texting her which I refused, telling myself I was being possessive for no reason. However, I asked him how he'd feel if I acted like this with his bff and that it felt very suspicious. He then told me he had to tell me something. He proceeds to confess that he's always had a fantasy for a threesome and that he had thought about my friend as a potential contender since he liked and trusted her, if that were to ever happen. I laughed in his face when he said this and told him that that was never going to happen. He said that he knows that, it was just something he briefly thought about, and that that was the only context he found her attractive. My idea was that a fantasy is just a fantasy. So, we talked about, I forgave him and just told myself to get over the jealousy. 

Then she came to visit us at our apartment. He was working, so her and I hung out together alone most of the time.  At one point, she talked about wanting to wear a more masculine shirt for whatever activity we had planned for the last day of her visit, and I let her borrow a shirt from my partner. When we got back home, my partner was on the couch unwinding from work, and she teased him by pretending to be him since she was wearing his clothes. We all sat and cuddled on the couch together and watched movies until it was almost time to take her back to the airport. At this point it was the middle of the night ( we were pulling an all-nighter) and I said I wanted to take a nap before going to the airport. My bf went with me, and she followed and we're all cuddling on the bed again, but I'm in the middle. I never fall asleep this time, so nothing happens. Once we get up and she's packing up her stuff, he lets her keep the shirt of his she's wearing, and she takes it with her. 

A few days after her visit, I got a call where she confessed what happened the last day in Cali to me. She told me she decided to do so because she felt guilty after my partner had sent her playlist that contained romantic/sexual songs in it. She also told me she was afraid to tell me about what happened because she was afraid, I would be upset with her. I told her it wasn't her fault and that I wasn't mad at her (which is true) because it was my boyfriend who ultimately made a move. She admitted to being flirtatious but promised me she only ever meant it in a platonic sense. I told her that he had mentioned a threesome fantasy before which I had immediately shut down (and again thought I could just look past because it was just a 'brief fantasy') and she told me she was hurt by this because she felt she was sexually objectified by him. 

I immediately called him and confronted him (I was visiting my mom when this happened, so we were a part) and he confessed everything to me. He told me step by step what happened that night but told me that the playlist was genuinely just a token of friendship (he makes playlists for all of his close friends, including female one's so I did feel inclined to believe him). When I got back, we went through the playlist together. Some context, my bf and bff are from the same country. He was born there, and she was not, so he put a lot of traditional music from that country to show her. He also showed me a text exchange with one of his own friends who even helped him find some of the songs. I would say 90% of the songs were like that, 5% were just old rock (which they would exchange recs when they would text each other so I didn't see this as romantic either) but there were at least three songs that were pretty romantic/sexual. He told me in detail why he decided to put those songs in there and that it all had to do with the melody and rhythm of the song rather than the lyrics. 

However, I was obviously more upset by the hand on hip thing that happened on our last night. He told me that he had tried to confess to me about it before but chickened out at the last moment and instead told me that he had just 'fantasized' about a threesome. He told me that that night he was feeling a lot of regret for not doing anything the entire trip and just staying inside all day despite this being his first time in another state in the US. When we all got in bed together that night and she reached over to rub his arm, he thought maybe he could do something adventurous for our final night to make up for not doing anything the whole trip. He said that he thought my bff was at least a little into him given their previous interactions and thought he'd try and make a move to initiate a threesome. He said as he was doing it, a switch flipped, and he realized what he was doing as wrong and didn't go any further and apologized in the morning. He reached out to her via text after we left and made the playlist because he wanted to emphasize that he did value her friendship and apologize for making a move. 

It's been months since this all went down. My bff and bf no longer are in contact with each other, and I basically have separate relationships with both of them. My bff says she loves me and that she'll never make me choose between them because she knows how much he means to me, but if we were to get married, she wouldn't attend the wedding. This was heartbreaking for me. 

I'm also devastated by the prospect of leaving my boyfriend. I was housing and assisting my mom who had left my abusive dad the year prior. She ended up going back to him and blamed me for it saying that living with me was so unpleasant that I drove her back there (she was secretly going back to see him on the weekends and was upset that I was so upset when I found out). My bf was my rock during this period of my life. He cared for me and helped me through obstacles that would have been insurmountable without him. My dad was sending me violent threats via text every day and this man would stay up with me all night until I felt safe. He's also helped me through so many health scares and helped me through so much grief that I have been through over the years. He's bent over backwards to take care of me.

The idea of breaking up with him feels so incredibly devastating and I feel like my life would be over. I've never had someone love me so much and make me feel so secure and I don't think I'll ever find someone else like that again. Part of me is also just scared of being alone. All my friends are out of state, I have no family, I'd be so utterly alone it would be terrifying. I just don't know what to do and ultimately feel like I'm a terrible person.

I also feel resentful of her and I feel incredibly guilty about that. I know a lot of it may be internalized misogyny, so I try to redirect my thoughts, but I do feel she crossed a boundary with him. None of my other close friends were ever physically affectionate with him like she was, and I don't think I would ever think to be physically affectionate like that with any of my friends' partners. At the same time, I know that's not an excuse for my boyfriend since he's the one who explicitly made a move. 

I just feel terrible, guilty, and shameful all the time. I'm having daily panic attacks and feel so much grief over a beautiful thing being stained and ruined forever. It feels so unfair. After a lifetime of abuse, I thought I finally found something good and beautiful in my life and it's been ripped away from me without me having to do anything. I feel so out of control of my life. And I have no one to talk to about this and no one to seek comfort from except from the person who hurt me. I feel so alone, and I don't know what to do. It's eating me alive, and I genuinely don't think I'll survive this. 

TLDR: BF and BFF became really close over the summer and BF made a move while we were all sleeping in the same bed together. Feeling really conflicted and falling apart because I don't know what to do.",0,1735088631.0,survivinginfidelity,2,0.33,False

I've always been prone to depression since I am neurodivergent but I swear since I started HRT, I became way more prone to be bothered by the tiniest things and overthink them to all hell, like, really silly shit makes me linger and fall into depression for hours, there's also many intrusive thoughts and emotions that are hard to deal with. In general day to day, my mind is constantly overthinking, falling into constant emotional slumps again and again and the only thing that alleviates it is something like drinking coffee but it's not perfect and it doesn't work all the time. There were times I wondered if it was all caused by HRT, few days ago I finally decided to test it by lowering my dose in half to 6.25. It seems I was proven right, my depression, intrusive emotions and overthinking were exacerbated by HRT, because in just one day my mind felt lighter, the incessant sadness and depression and overthinking were like 90% less and I felt like I can just live life fine but here comes the caveat that made me make this post. 
Not long after on day 2, I started to feel the good old male inability to cry again, like there was this emotional wall again, and also the weirdest thing is that I started to feel like a guy again, like I can't describe it properly but my mind started feeling like pre-HRT me, I just started to feel masculine again, dysphoria increased, and I just didn't feel like the girl I've been for the past year. So I immediately went back on the higher dose and everything went back to how it's been for the past year but I am back with dealing with the depression and overthinking, and I am sick of those, so I don't know what to do?

1hlqmrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hlqmrc/first_time_ghosted_and_kinda_sucks/,first time ghosted and kinda sucks,"Hey guys! F24 here. So my last serious relationship was 4 years ago. I have been doing my own thing, travelling, working on myself, building beautiful friendships in that time since and really finding my identity, which has been great! Don’t get me wrong, I’ve slept with other people, flings ect. I don’t use dating apps often, I’d rather meet someone in person. Now and then I get curious and create an account to see if anything piques my interest. A month ago I did this. 

I work in a small cafe and I matched with a fairly new customer. I don’t usually initiate, never put myself out there with guys and keep to myself a lot so I did something out of my comfort zone and messaged him. Seeing him come into my work definitely made it easier too because I got to know his vibe ect. We hit it off and by the end of the day we’d organised to go for a drink the next night. 

Next night comes along, he greets me with a hug and we sit at this place for 3 hours just talking non stop and although still trying to suss the vibe it was nice to have decent conversations with him and they flowed really well. We ended up going back to his place because he didn’t live too far away, the venue was shutting and we both wanted to keep chatting. From there we were up chatting till around 2am. I was honest with him and said I don’t usually do this, meet up with guys, go to their house ect but he made me feel really comfortable! Not once did I ever feel like I was unsafe. It was welcomed. I learnt he’s a very affectionate person too, which I can be as well once comfortable with someone so by the end of the night we were cuddled up to each other. Him with a hand on my leg or I holding his hand. It was strange, it felt like we’d just connected so easily…but part of me was also thinking wtf am I doing right now 🤣 We ended up sleeping together and god damn was it great ahahahaha and afters we went to bed and he hugged me to sleep. 

The next morning I woke up to him literally giving me heart eyes. I just thought oh GOD 12 hours it took for us to end up here 🤣 He kept reminiscing on the night before, how much he wanted to just lay in bed all day with me, do it all again when he gets back from working away and I agreed but also felt a little wary and worried he was beginning to come on a bit strong. We get up into the kitchen and he’s cuddling me from behind saying things like “I just wanna go back to us sitting on the couch when you had your legs on mine” and look, usually that would make me go ugh but something about this guy made it hit different ahahaha and one thing I distinctly remember him saying to me before I left was, “Don’t go ghosting me now because I know where you work and you cant get rid of me that easily!” I thought it was funny and warmed me a little. I don’t ghost, I’m straight up with my feelings so I knew for certain I wouldn’t do that. 

Throughout the week we were chatting and he suggested many times to hang out again but most nights I finished work too late and then I got sick so didn’t want him to get it. He would say things like tomorrow I’ll come in grab a coffee and then at night I’ll come grab a beer at your other job. Just like super keen to hang out and see me, probably more than I wanted to see him. Again, he was coming on really eager and strong and part of me just thought is this guy serious? I was kinda surprised by it but again, it was welcomed and I was open to it. 

A week after our first date and a week of chatting consistently I asked him to hang out because finally it all aligned and I had the time free! He ghosted me. I don’t double text…I have this funny thing with not wanting to pester people, I just don’t have that try hard attitude with things so I waited for him to be the one to message me. A few days went on and I could see him active on socials but no message. Feeling gutted, I decided to message him asking if everything is okay, why he ghosted me and if he’s just not feeling it anymore. 

He replied instantly and apologised for not communicating with me. Long story short he has a bit going on in life with family, work but is still up seeing each other just doesn’t want to jump into anything at all. 

Not gonna lie, that made me mad because his behaviours were not that of someone who doesn’t want to jump into anything. And the whole “Don’t ghost me now” thing?!? I was like what the hell at that ahahahha So I just wanna know what your guys interpretation is of this. 

As I said earlier, I never date, open myself up to guys as I did with this one. It’s all pretty new to me and while my goals atm are not to find a lifelong partner I’m just open to meeting someone and if it works out then cool! I understand we only knew each other for a week, it’s my fault we slept together first date but I’m genuinely gutted that things ended up like this in the end! What I think may have happened is someone better came along and he’s just letting me down easy but I still wanted that closure with him, not left wondering wth I did.

I know its not the end of the world, I love the life I live (I move to Japan in 3 weeks im sooooo excited) and Im a very positive and happy person so at the end of the day this is just a little notch in my life experience belt and I know another doorway will open someplace else 💗

1hlqhsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/threebodyproblem/comments/1hlqhsy/the_trisolarans_dominant_strategy_is_to_befriend/,"The Trisolarans' dominant strategy is to befriend Earth, not fight it","Just finished reading Book 1, and I have some questions/thoughts. Would love to hear counter-arguments to my points, **but please don't spoil anything from the next two books.**

1. I think Ye Wenjie is a very well-motivated character. This entire story hinges on the believability of a human actively choosing to subjugate us to a power higher than us on the food chain, leading to our own destruction. Considering what Ye went through during the Cultural Revolution, her actions were at least understandable (though not agreeable). **I will say, I actually think the Netflix show did this better. In the show, Ye didn’t make the final decision to help the Trisolarans until** ***after*** **she had met with the girl who killed her father.** I think this is much more powerful, because it crystallizes the theme of the story. The way Netflix portrays it, if Ye had received an apology, it would have been a symbol of humanity’s capacity for redemption; and she may not have gone through with the Trisolaran contact. The book makes the same point with this scene, but I think it loses much of its impact by occurring *after* Ye has already forsaken humanity to the Trisolarans. The Netflix show uses that scene as the final tipping point for Ye, and I think that’s much more effective.

1. I very much enjoyed the puzzle-solving aspect of the story, i.e. having to figure out the nature of Trisolaris’s chaotic climate.

1. **Wang Miao was kind of boring.** When I have an issue with a protagonist, I like to analyze them with a rubric created by author Brandon Sanderson. He says that a good protagonist should be at least two of the following: proactive, competent, and sympathetic. In my estimation, the only one of these traits that Wang Miao exhibits is competence. And I feel like even that is not portrayed as powerfully as it could be. Yes, he figured out that Trisolaris suffers from the 3 Body Problem, but the way it was portrayed…I don’t know how to explain it, but it didn’t *feel* like he had accomplished something major by figuring that out. Maybe it’s because many other people in the story (those who played the 3BP game) had figured it out too. Or maybe it’s because I’d already watched season 1 of the Netflix show and knew the answer beforehand. Either way, even if I (reluctantly) grant him the ""competency"" metric,  I think he still fails on the other two.

1. **What the hell is the point of Wang Miao having a wife and kid?** They added nothing to the story. If anything, their presence took away from Wang Miao’s likeability because he treats them like afterthoughts. This is only made worse by the fact that he spends most of the story longing for and low-key obsessing over a woman he never actually met (Yang Dong). I have to assume that his wife and child will play a more significant role in the following books, because if not, their presence is inexplicable to me.
2. **The ETO’s, especially the Adventists’, ideological motivations seem weak to me.** The coffee shop scene felt especially cartoonish, because it seems like Adventist-sympathizers arrived at this position through a logical deduction that either humanity could not be saved or was not worth saving. But I don’t know…maybe it’s just me, but I feel like such extreme positions are only undertaken by people with strong *emotional* reasons (even if they won’t admit it to themselves). Of all the characters presented as part of the ETO, the only one whose motivation I could accept was Ye Wenjie.

1. The vetting process for joining the Adventists seems way too lax - show up in a coffee shop, lie about your intentions, and boom, you’re in? Like seriously? Pan Han is incompetent at best and deserved to get popped.

1. I like the fact that Earth and Trisolaris are evenly balanced - although Trisolaris is far more advanced technologically, the Earth’s rate of growth is much faster, such that they will likely outpace Trisolaris by the time they arrive. A good, solid game where neither party has a clear advantage. As someone who enjoys game theory, the premise of this story scratches an itch for me. 

1. **However, I simply don’t think Trisolaris is using the most effective strategy to ensure their survival.** In the book, it’s demonstrated that Trisolaris attacks Earth not only because they want to take it over, but also as a *defensive* measure. The idea being that if humans are allowed to advance, humans might surpass Trisolarians, view them as prey, and try to take over *their* planet. But like…isn’t Trisolaris kind of a shithole? Lol. It’s literally a dying planet that could get swallowed into the sun at any moment. Even if Earth develops the capability to take over Trisolaris…why the hell would they want to? Resources? No, because there are probably much closer options than traveling 4 light years away. Humans may not even need to leave the solar system for resources. Then, perhaps Earth might attack Trisolaris over ideological differences? Well, ideological differences only matter when you are physically close enough to the other party for their ideology to affect your life in some way (e.g. neighboring countries, or tribes sharing the same space).  But humans and Trisolarans are so far away from each other - who gives a fuck about the ideology of people on a dying planet 4 light years away? All this to say: the Trisolarans actively choosing to antagonize Earth almost 100% leads to a war scenario; and considering that they have very real reason to fear Earth, this seems like a bad idea. Why not try to befriend Earth instead? Maybe share some tech with them? Maybe with the two planets’ best minds working together, combined with the fact that Earth doesn’t have to deal with Chaotic Eras, a solution for Trisolaris’ problem could be found. Or maybe humans might even elect to share planet Earth with Trisolarans. Of course, the Trisolarians are right in their assessment that humans are a warfaring race, and friendly (or no) contact *might* end in Trisolarians’ destruction. But antagonistic contact will *almost definitely* lead to the Trisolarians’ destruction, unless they manage to defeat the humans. In general, I don’t see a downside to starting off with diplomacy and friendliness whenever dealing with a foreign entity. The possibility of war is always on the table. You’ll get to it if you get to it. But I see no reason to make it a first resort.

1. The stuff about the sophons was fascinating. I really liked the chapter when we see the Trisolarans unfolding the protons. I only wish I had the physics knowledge to understand the mechanics of what they were doing. For those who do, this part of the book was probably super fun.  My favorite part was when they unfolded the proton into 3D, and it displayed intelligence by turning into a giant eye and trying to annihilate the capital city, lol. Is this what cosmic horror is? I’ve never read/watched it before, but if this is it, I like it.  **But this makes me wonder - if unfolded protons are sentient, how can they control them? Is this something that will be explained later in the story?**

1. The scene at the end where Trisolaris sends the “You are bugs” message to the Earth resistance group is weird to me. If Earthlings really are no more than bugs, why do you feel the need to tell them that? Do you take the time out of your day to verbally establish superiority before stepping on an anthill? The only possible reason I can think to send that message is to instill fear in the resistance group. But if you’re superior, why do you need Earth to fear you (especially when they already do!)? The message felt like a petulant, emotional reaction to getting caught spying. This is something I wouldn’t expect of Trisolarans, who are supposed to be relatively stoic.

1. Finally, the idea of irrational mob rule exhibited by Liu’s portrayal of the Cultural Revolution resonates with me. In recent years in the US, I’ve increasingly felt as though rationality has been tossed aside in favor of mindless tribalism. Just as the purveyors of the Cultural Revolution eschewed modern science because much of it was coming from the West, I feel like many people today will ignore any information that does not serve their political purpose and refuse to acknowledge correctness in anything the opposing side does. This is something I truly detest, especially because this behavior is motivated by fear. The leaders fear being proven wrong and losing power. The followers fear being wrong, but they also fear being eaten alive by their compatriots if they step out of line.  In general I’d consider myself a populist, but what I learned from the Cultural Revolution in this book (I have almost no context/knowledge of it outside of 3 Body Problem) is that while an angry (perhaps even *justifiably* angry) youth can be an immense force for change, the difficulty in controlling this beast means that this change could easily be for the worse, rather than the better. (Through the lens of this book and that of my own ideologies, I would say the Cultural Revolution was for the worse, but I acknowledge that at the end of the day it’s a matter of perspective. I don’t know what conditions were like before, and perhaps many Chinese people look fondly upon the aftermath of the Revolution. Like I said, I’m not studied up on this, so I don’t know.)

Overall, although I have some issues with the book, I'm locked in for the ride and I can't wait to continue!

Now feeling meh.

I'd like to know if I'm doing this as optimally as possible, I'd love any feedback on what I'm doing please!

I am doing this to heal the damage the covid vaccine did to me. I have incredibly bad brain fog, memory problems and MCAS now and I'm hoping this diet can help me. If anyone has any anecdotes about how long it took for those issues to be helped me them I'd definitely love to hear them please.

**Start date:** 19/12/2024

**Height:** 5'11""

**Weight:** 154ibs (estimate)

**Age:** 28

Diet (per day):

1kg 12.5% unaged beef mince (2150kcal, 125g fat)(Unaged stuff is really expensive so cannot afford steaks, I have to have this due to having MCAS, aka histamine intolerance, from the covid vaccine)

5 tablespoons of tallow (**575 calories and 65 grams of fat**)

40g frozen, raw, unaged beef liver (**40g of liver** has approximately **55 kcal and \~2g of fat**)

Water.

\~500mg magnesium

1/4 tsp potassium

1 tsp salt

**Total: 2780kcal, 192g fat.**

20/12/2024

Woke up feeling awful. Got more energy throughout the day. After dinner I felt great, so much energy, like I'd had a coffee.

21/12/2024

Noticing some pubic hair loss. This is apparently from the shock/stress to the system of entering ketosis. More energy than average but not as much as yesterday. Executive dysfunction seems to be reduced. Not wanting to eat the mince much. Did some tasks which I’d been putting off for ages which was unusual.

22/12/2024

Heightened focus on work. It was still not easy to get into work, but when I did I focussed much more than I have for a long, long time. The mince was significantly easier to eat after dropping the salt to 1 tsp and 1/4 tsp potassium.

24/12/2024

Feeling normal, maybe slightly worse than normal now. I believe the great energy I felt in the beginning was from cortisol from my body feeling the stress of shifting into ketosis. I haven’t had a poo since starting the diet. Whiter sperm.

As we navigate the internet for work, socializing, banking, shopping, and entertainment, we generate vast amounts of data. This data is constantly being collected, analyzed, and sometimes exploited by companies, governments, and hackers. VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)In today’s digital age, the need for online privacy has never been more important. As we navigate the internet for work, socializing, banking, shopping, and entertainment, we generate vast amounts of data. This data is constantly being collected, analyzed, and sometimes exploited by companies, governments, and hackers. VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) have emerged as one of the most effective tools for enhancing online privacy and protecting your sensitive information. In this post, we’ll explore the importance of VPNs for online privacy, how they work, and why you should consider using one.

1. What is a VPN?

A VPN is a service that creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device (laptop, smartphone, tablet) and the internet. When you connect to a VPN, all the data you send and receive is routed through a secure server operated by the VPN provider. This connection encrypts your internet traffic, making it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept it.

In addition to encryption, a VPN hides your real IP address and replaces it with the IP address of the VPN server. This makes it difficult for websites, advertisers, and even your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to track your online activity or pinpoint your physical location.

2. How VPNs Protect Your Online Privacy

2.1. Encrypting Your Internet Traffic

One of the key functions of a VPN is encryption. VPNs use strong encryption methods (such as AES-256-bit encryption) to secure your internet connection. This means that any data sent between your device and the VPN server is transformed into unreadable code. Even if a hacker or a malicious actor manages to intercept your connection, they won’t be able to decrypt and access your sensitive information without the encryption key.

This is especially important when using unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi at airports, coffee shops, or hotels, where hackers often lurk to steal personal information such as login credentials, bank details, and credit card numbers.

2.2. Hiding Your IP Address and Location

Your IP address is a unique identifier for your device and can reveal a lot of information about you, including your geographical location, browsing habits, and potentially even your identity. By using a VPN, your real IP address is replaced with the IP address of the VPN server, making it harder for websites and third parties to track your location and online activities.

This feature is important not only for privacy but also for avoiding personalized ads or targeted content based on your browsing history. It also helps prevent websites from tracking your activity across different sites or collecting data about your interests.

2.3. Preventing Tracking and Profiling

Many websites and online services collect data on your browsing habits for targeted advertising or profiling purposes. This practice, known as behavioral tracking, involves tracking your online movements, including the sites you visit, the products you browse, and even the time you spend on specific pages.

By masking your IP address and encrypting your connection, a VPN makes it harder for advertisers and data brokers to track your activities and build detailed profiles about you. This helps protect your privacy and reduces the amount of personal data that’s available for sale to third parties.

3. Why VPNs Are Crucial for Online Privacy

3.1. Protection Against Hackers and Cyberattacks

The internet is filled with potential cyber threats, including hackers, malware, and phishing scams. One of the primary reasons for using a VPN is to protect your data from falling into the wrong hands. Hackers often use man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks to intercept and steal data, especially when users connect to public Wi-Fi networks.

A VPN protects your data from such attacks by encrypting it, ensuring that even if your connection is intercepted, it remains secure. This is particularly crucial for activities like online banking, shopping, and accessing sensitive work documents.

3.2. Safeguarding Your Personal Information

Many websites and online services require you to provide personal information, such as your name, address, credit card details, and email address. Unfortunately, this information can be harvested by third parties if you’re not careful about your online privacy. VPNs can help safeguard your personal data by making it harder for websites and advertisers to track your identity and collect your data.

By using a VPN, you reduce the risk of your sensitive information being exposed or sold without your consent. For example, even if a website collects your data, it will only have access to the IP address of the VPN server, not your real identity or location.

3.3. Avoiding Government Surveillance and Censorship

In some countries, governments heavily monitor internet activity and censor access to certain websites or online platforms. For individuals living in these regions or traveling abroad, a VPN provides a way to circumvent censorship and access the open internet freely.

A VPN can help you maintain your privacy by preventing government agencies or other entities from tracking your online activities. It also enables access to geo-restricted content, such as streaming platforms or websites blocked in certain countries.

3.4. Avoiding ISP Monitoring and Throttling

Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) can monitor your online activities and throttle your connection, especially if you're streaming high-definition content, playing online games, or downloading large files. Some ISPs may intentionally slow down your connection to manage network congestion or push you to upgrade to a more expensive plan.

Using a VPN hides your online activities from your ISP, preventing them from monitoring or throttling your connection. With a VPN, you can enjoy faster internet speeds and uninterrupted streaming without the fear of being limited by your ISP.

4. VPNs and Online Privacy in the Modern World

As online privacy concerns grow, the role of VPNs in safeguarding our digital lives becomes even more critical. With increasing government surveillance, corporate data collection, and cybercrime, VPNs provide a much-needed shield against these threats.

4.1. The Growing Need for Privacy Tools

With the rise of social media, data collection, and the increasing threat of cyberattacks, more individuals are turning to privacy tools like VPNs to protect their personal information. VPNs are now considered an essential part of digital hygiene, especially for individuals who frequently use public Wi-Fi or want to maintain anonymity while browsing the web.

4.2. The Shift Toward Decentralized Internet

In the future, the internet may become more decentralized, giving users greater control over their personal data. As this shift takes place, VPNs will play a pivotal role in helping individuals protect their online privacy and secure their digital identities in a more open and decentralized online space.

5. Conclusion

VPNs are an essential tool for anyone looking to protect their online privacy in today’s connected world. By encrypting your internet traffic, hiding your IP address, and preventing tracking, VPNs provide a crucial layer of protection against cyber threats, government surveillance, and data collection. Whether you're browsing the web, accessing sensitive information, or simply want to avoid being tracked, using a VPN is one of the most effective ways to safeguard your privacy.

If you value your online privacy, a VPN should be part of your digital toolkit. With countless VPN options available, it’s important to choose one that provides strong encryption, a no-logs policy, and reliable performance to ensure that your data remains secure.

1hlqev2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HoneydewPersonal1739/comments/1hlqev2/on_margate_kent_uk_and_gentrification/,On Margate Kent UK and gentrification. ,"Margate’s new wave of ""DFLs"" (Down From London) seems to come with a strange mix of urban pretension and provincial nostalgia. On the surface, it looks like they’re bringing a cosmopolitan edge to the town, think craft beer bars, art galleries, and vegan cafes... but scratch the surface, and something’s missing.

A lot of these people aren’t really ""Londoners"" in the way you’d think. Many grew up in small, predominantly white towns before moving to London, and now they’re heading to Margate, bringing with them a very narrow cultural framework. It’s like they’re playing at urban sophistication, but their ideas of ""cool"" often feel dated or shallow.

What’s striking is how poorly equipped many of them are to engage in an international or multicultural context. Margate has the potential to become a vibrant, diverse place, but instead, the influx of DFLs often reinforces the same kind of provincialism they claim to have left behind. It’s all very white British, with a thin mask of urbanity that doesn’t really hold up under closer inspection.

The result? Margate ends up feeling like a strange mix of gentrification and cultural stagnation. There’s an artsy vibe, sure, but it’s not exactly cutting-edge (save for Tracie's circle), and it doesn’t seem to embrace much beyond a narrow, self-referential bubble. It’s like they’ve brought London’s coffee shops but left behind its actual diversity and cultural depth.

It’s not to say Margate isn’t changing—clearly it is... but it feels like it’s stuck somewhere between trying to be cosmopolitan and staying provincial. If anything, it highlights how gentrification can sometimes bring more shallow change than real cultural growth.

The difference between the locals and the DF""L""s is that the locals never left, the new comers just moved from one provincial town to the next via London and think they are better 👏👏👏👏👏👏 Please come down you pedestals, it's sad and embarrasing. And bring your old folk, they'll really feel at home here, at the greasy spoon. 

After 3 years of analysis, I've finally spat it out and it feels grrrrreat.🤣🦁

I value meaningful friendships and love getting to know people who bring fresh perspectives.

A little about me: I’m passionate about traveling and exploring new cultures, especially when it comes to food. Cooking and baking are two of my favorite ways to unwind—I enjoy experimenting with new recipes and flavors and would love to swap ideas with fellow food lovers. I’m also a big coffee enthusiast, always on the hunt for the perfect cup or a cozy café to spend time in.

I’m a curious learner, always eager to dive into a new topic, whether it’s related to my work or just something that catches my interest. Lately, audiobooks have become my go-to for relaxing and enjoying great stories during busy days. In my downtime, I also enjoy gaming as a fun way to unwind.

If you enjoy talking about travel, food, books, coffee, or life in general, I’d love to connect!",2,1735087602.0,penpalsover30,0,0.75,False

I'm home from college for the holidays, and I'm having a rough time. I'm realizing how many rules my parents have that feel so unfair and stressful. 

Some of these rules include:
1. No eating anywhere near dinner and if I am caught eating I will be scolded (we have dinner at 7, but this rule means 3pm onward).
2. No making noise after 8:30pm, even for good reason. That also means no showering.
3. All chores must be done as soon as I wake up. So, forego eating breakfast or having coffee or washing up at all.
4. Door must be open when I have my boyfriend over. He's 22 almost 23.
5. They have me on life360 and if I'm going to be home later than 10 I have to tell them otherwise I will get a bunch of calls and texts.

They also both have very short fuses. When I'm asked to do something (many, many, many times a day for all sorts of tasks that they would rather I be doing), they dont start it off by communicating with me like an adult. No matter what I'm doing, even if I'm trying to eat, trying to shower, if my friends are over, what have you - they will constantly have me doing tasks. I have to scoop the cat litter and walk the dog and do the dishes and clean the house all while entertaining guests, so I don't have guests over. Also, they start off already mad that I haven't done whatever it is BEFORE they ask. Or they just blow up at me for random things, especially my dad, he can go from 0-100 so quickly.
Nevermind a lifetime of him yelling at me, and saying awful things about me. I can hear my parents talking bad about me while I'm in the house. It's awful. I'm a nice kid I think, I'm a straight A student, I don't do anything bad I don't know what they want from me. 

A lifetime of this has made me walk around my house insanely dissociated. It's the feeling of walking into a room and forgetting why you were there - but for the entirety of my ""break"" here. I didn't realize it was this bad until I left for college, and now that I'm back it's shocking that I used to operate like this for years. I'm so tired of this. Any support would be appreciated.",3,1735087327.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False
