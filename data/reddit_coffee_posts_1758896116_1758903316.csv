1nr4n30,https://www.reddit.com/r/prozac/comments/1nr4n30/for_the_new_people_joining/,For the new people joining!,"Greetings everyone,
Since a lot of new faces pop in asking the same stuff about Prozac, here’s a big ol’ FAQ post. Not medical advice though, just what I’ve seen as someone on Prozac for a while and moderating this sub. Hope it helps calm the nerves if you’re just starting out.
⚠️: Always double-check with your healthcare advisor. Everyone’s brain is wired differently.

-FAQ-
1. How long until it kicks in?
💊 ️ Small changes in 2 to 4 weeks, fuller effect 6 to 8 weeks. It’s more like a dimmer switch than a light switch.

2. Why do I feel worse before better?
💊 ️ Early side effects can make you feel off, think anxiety spikes, nausea, or emotional weirdness. Usually temporary.

3. Do the side effects calm down?
💊 Most early ones (nausea, headaches, jitters, sleep changes) ease up after a few weeks. Sexual side effects can stick longer, varies person to person.

 4. Will I get addicted to Prozac?
💊 Nope. It’s not addictive in the way nicotine or alcohol is. You can have withdrawal-like effects if you stop suddenly, but that’s because your brain’s adjusting, not because you’re hooked.

5. What if I miss a dose?
💊 Missing one pill usually isn’t a crisis (Prozac has a long half-life, meaning it stays in your system for days). Just take the next one at your regular time. Don’t double-dose.

6. Should I take it in the morning or at night?
💊 ️ Depends on you. Some people feel energized → take it in the morning. Some get sleepy → take it at night. Trial and error is normal.

7. Can I drink coffee with Prozac?
💊 Yep, but watch out. Prozac can make some people jittery in the beginning, and caffeine can crank that up.

8. What’s the deal with weird dreams?
💊 ️ Totally a thing. Vivid dreams, odd storylines, even nightmares. Usually settles with time.

9. Will I gain/lose weight?
💊 ️ Mixed bag. Some lose at first (less appetite), some gain slowly over time. Not guaranteed either way.

10. How do I know if it’s working?
💊 It’s usually subtle. You might notice you don’t spiral as hard, you bounce back quicker, or daily stuff feels less heavy. It’s rarely a dramatic “woah I’m cured” moment.

11. Can I take other meds/supplements with Prozac?
💊 ️ Some combos can be risky (like certain migraine meds, St. John’s Wort, MAOIs). Always run it by your prescriber or pharmacist first.

12. What happens if I stop taking it?
💊 ️ Because Prozac has a long half-life, tapering off is usually easier than other SSRIs. Still, don’t just quit cold turkey. Let your doc guide you.

13. Can it make me feel numb?
💊 Emotional blunting is real for some people. It doesn’t mean you’ll never feel joy again, but you may notice less intense highs/lows. It's worth talking to your doctor if it bothers you.

14. Will Prozac change my personality?
💊 Nope. It doesn’t create a new “you.” Ideally, it helps you feel more like yourself without depression/anxiety weighing you down.

15. Why do I feel emotionally flat?
💊 ️ Emotional blunting may not feel sad, but you also don’t feel super happy. Sometimes lowering the dose or switching meds helps. Talk to your doctor if it’s a dealbreaker.


And yes,if there’s something on your mind that I didn’t cover here, please don’t hold back. Ask away in the comments, no matter how “small” or “silly” it feels. We’ve all been the new person googling side effects at 2 AM. This sub is meant to feel like a safe little corner of the internet where you don’t have to have it all figured out. We’re here to share, vent, laugh about the weird dreams, and remind each other that starting meds isn’t a weakness rather it’s a step toward healing. 
You’re not alone in this. You’ve got a whole community walking alongside you, one day at a time.

1nr4mc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nr4mc6/great_in_person_hotcold_by_phone_feels_like/,"Great in person, hot-cold by phone — feels like attention seeking now. Push for one more meet or move on?","27M here. I’ve been seeing a 26F for about 6 weeks. We met 5–6 times (even a full weekend) and in person it was genuinely great — fun, deep talks, time flew by. We also had an honest talk about “us”; she said she enjoys being with me but needs some time.

Then the turn: right after a nice conversation I noticed she created a new Hinge profile. We’re not exclusive, but it felt off. I brought it up (I’m direct). She brushed it off (“just to stalk people”). After that, we had three days of silence (from both of us). Since then, something’s changed.

What it looks like now:
	•	I feel powerless and keep wanting to communicate just to maintain contact.
	•	If I don’t reply at night, she often pings in the morning.
	•	Voice notes are pretty empty; lots of talk, no actual plans.
	•	Almost zero initiative from her to meet; cancellations or vague “I’m already out” excuses.
	•	Sometimes she just shows up where I am (pretty sure because of the Snapchat map) — but still doesn’t commit to actual plans.
	•	I’m uncertain if this is even a relationship track or just a situationship.

At this point, I honestly think the core of our “getting to know each other” has turned into attention seeking: lots of digital engagement (Snap/WhatsApp), minimal real-life follow-through. Texts and voice notes without in-person time just leave me confused and drained.

I’ve tried to see it from her side (maybe she’s anxious or unsure after the Hinge thing), but the hot-cold + low effort pattern keeps repeating. I usually like leading, but I also hate rejection — this combo makes me feel stuck.

I’m also actively dating. Part of me wants to get back on Hinge and meet others so I’m not stuck in limbo. Another part of me thinks I should try one last in-person meet to get clarity — because texting won’t fix this.

Questions:
	•	Should I send one last, simple invite (e.g., “Wed 6pm coffee?”) and if it’s vague/cancelled, I’m done?
	•	Or stop initiating completely and see if she steps up?
	•	Is it smarter to resume dating others now and stop investing here?
	•	Has anyone dealt with a phase that turned into attention seeking — how did you handle the exit?

Appreciate any perspectives.

Being single since 3yrs and now I have no idea now how actually dating is. Anyways met a girl on hinge and damn we vibed sooo well. Good energy in texts, very humble, even gave reasons on why the replies were delayed. I was shocked, confused but happy. We both had mad love for dance. 

3days after texting we met and partied. We danced crazy. Like the whole vibe was sooo good and we had v cute moments while dancing. Surprisingly she called me to her place and we had beer  and we started dancing again.

It was getting romantic and I was enjoying the moments. Not dump enough to not realize it's just some good moments but I was very happy. Yes we kissed but nothing else happened we cuddled and slept off.

Morning she made me coffee and I was liking all of it. Like I wanted to spend more time. 

From next day her texting energy came down and I thought of telling what I felt so I told ""ik it's early but I would like to spend more time with you ""

The reply came after 1 whole day (the same person who used to reply fast). She replied telling she forgot her phone somewhere and just got it back. Next day again she replied for my texts v late telling she had a long day and she was sick.

Now its been 3 days since that text and she hasn't replied to Like 10+ messages and 10 + calls. I have no idea what's happening.

This is always there in my mind and it's an unnecessary baggage. How do you guys just leave it like that? 

Isn't giving closure important atleast to a person who cared? How will ik now what has happened.? 

Idk whether I should leave it or try something else but can't take out the fact that the best date ended like this. I'm still waiting cuz what if she is genuinely in trouble? But if not can't she atleast tell me to stop texting and fuck off????",0,1758901087.0,BangaloreSocial,2,0.5,False

Here’s the thing: I haven’t gotten to take her out yet. I did try once before with a specific invite, but the timing supposedly didn’t work on her end. She suggested we’d plan something in October since her schedule should be more flexible then. Since then, we’ve kept talking, but she hasn’t made any apparent effort to suggest a time herself.

Now I’m trying to figure out the best way to move this forward without dragging it out or wasting time if she’s not actually interested.


Option 1: I give her a time from or a couple dates and ask her to pick what works best. That way, I’ll know pretty quickly if she’s brushing me off.

Option 2: I just ask her straight up when she’s free, and let her set the time. Some of my friends like this idea since it puts the ball in her court.


I genuinely like her, but I don’t want to fall into a “friendzone or brother in Christ zone” either. Do you think it’s better to give her a clear range and see if she takes it, or ask her to set the time herself?",1,1758900927.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False
1nr4iji,https://www.reddit.com/r/zurich/comments/1nr4iji/im_starting_another_scifi_book_club_on_fridays_at/,I'm starting a(nother) Sci-Fi Book Club on Fridays at Stettbacher,"Around 3 years ago I already (semi-successfully) created a bookclub via Reddit and actually managed to create a group of 20+ people who met around once per month for around a year.

But despite stating my desired focus of sci-fi, many people who joined weren't that into it and many people who showed up didn't even read the books. To compromise, we read generic classics half the time.  
 It was also a pain to organise, mostly being hosted at my and 1 other person's homes. It immediately died when I stopped putting in the work of setting dates, creating book polls, coordinating snacks, hosting.....

Because I would really like to talk more about the amazing books I've been reading and get to know other sci-fi enthusiasts, I would like to give it another try but this time without trying to please everyone and keeping the required effort low.

So here are the parameters:

* **Time/Date**: Fridays, 17:30-19:00, once per month. Starting **17.10. and 14.11.**
* **Location:** Stettbacher (Café 2mins from Stettbacher train station)
* **Open to:** Everyone, as long as you're into Sci-Fi and are interested in actually reading and talking about the books
* **Signing up**: You're welcome to just show up, or send me a DM and I'll add you to a WhatsApp Group.

I'm aware this time and place won't work for everyone who might be interested, but it's on my way home from work, has great coffee and cakes (and beer/soda), always has space in the evening and most importantly of all: It doesn't require anyone to host a group at home. And it's like 12min from HB, so it's actually fairly central...

I'm happy to define ""Sci-Fi"" relatively loosely and mix it up between subgenres. For the first meet-up (17. Oct) I'll be (re-)reading **Shroud by Adrian Tchaikovsky.** If this book club actually ends up happening we can chose the future titles democratically among those who show up :)

There are semi-regular posts about book clubs on here and r/Switzerland, so I know there's quite some interest. I hope this initiative will be a success and I get to know some interesting people and talk about interesting books with you. And if not, then I'll still be there enjoying some cake and reading by myself.

1nr4i3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nr4i3o/explore_if_waterdrop_wdinls_inline_water_filter/,Explore If Waterdrop WD-INL-S Inline Water Filter Truly Delivers in This Review,"The Waterdrop WD-INL-S Inline Water Filter is a product that I decided to test out thoroughly, given its reputation and promises. Billed as an NSF-certified, high-capacity water filtration system, it caught my attention with its broad compatibility, easy installation, and multi-usage applications. With a busy household that includes a perpetually thirsty toddler, a caffeine-loving spouse, and an ever-growing need for clean water at the ready, I took this product through its paces. What follows is a detailed dive into everything you need to know about this inline water filter—from its shining strengths to the small quirks that might make you pause before adding it to your cart.

**Design and Build Quality**

The very first thing I noticed when unboxing this inline water filter was its lightweight nature. Weighing only 0.9 pounds, it felt almost too light for something with such high filtration capacity. The white color and compact cylindrical design (measuring just 3.38” x 10.78”) blend seamlessly with most refrigerator units or under-sink setups. The material, activated carbon, spoke to me of its intention to prioritize effective filtration. It felt sturdy enough but not excessively bulky, something I appreciated as someone who hates fiddling around with tools in tight spaces. In my case, I installed it behind the refrigerator, and I barely noticed it was there after setup.

**Ease of Installation**

As someone who considers themselves moderately handy at best, I was bracing for frustration during the installation process. Thankfully, this Waterdrop inline filter includes 1/4"" compression fittings and push-to-connect adapters, which simplified the work significantly. Following the provided instructions, connecting it to the waterline was fairly straightforward. It took me about 10 minutes, and I was done without needing professional assistance, which my wallet certainly appreciated. That said, be sure to insert the PE tube into the filter cartridge by at least 20 mm to avoid leaks. I may or may not have learned this the hard way during my overly enthusiastic testing phase.

[Check Waterdrop WD-INL-S Inline Water Filter price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b08bfv9ftp/)

**Filtration Effectiveness**

Once installed, I wanted to assess how well this filter performed the task it was designed for—cleaning water. The NSF 42 and 372 certifications were reassuring. The product claims to reduce chlorine, taste, and odor by 97.6%, and my fresh cup of morning coffee tasted noticeably better after switching from tap to filtered water. The activated carbon technology works wonders. However, it’s worth noting that while this filters out unwanted tastes, odors, and sediment, it does not reduce Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). If you’re looking for reverse osmosis-level purification, this system isn’t designed for that.

**Merits**

- Lightweight and compact design that makes installation in tight spaces easy.
- Improves both the taste and odor of the water dramatically thanks to its activated carbon filtration.
- Multi-usage capability: suitable for refrigerators, coffee makers, RVs, and even boats.
- Long lifespan with a capacity of up to 1,400 gallons, meaning less frequent replacement.

**Downsides**

- Does not offer TDS reduction, which could be a dealbreaker for those seeking ultra-pure water filtration.
- Installation, while easy overall, still demands careful attention to prevent tubing leaks.
- The provided connectors might not fit snugly with all setups, requiring additional adapters in some cases.

**Performance and Daily Use**

Living with this filter daily was pretty seamless. It quietly delivered fresh, odor-free water with no interruptions, which is everything I could ask for in a water filtration product. That said, customers leveraging it for diverse equipment like coffee machines or RVs will need to ensure compatibility beforehand. Its durable design also uses coconut shell carbon with an impressive filtration accuracy of 0.5 microns. In our household, its workload included topping off our ice maker, and the icy fresh water definitely passed my family’s taste tests.

**Competitors**

Inline water filters are not a rare species in the market, and it wouldn't be fair to overlook some of the prominent challengers that exist. For instance, the GE GXRTDR competes closely with a higher price tag but slightly wider pressure range compatibility. On the other hand, Culligan’s IC-100A offers similar filtration capabilities but doesn’t boast the lifespan offered by this filter. The Waterdrop filter stood out in terms of affordability for its features and the combination of certifications, making it a competitive pick among its rival brands. Other filters like the Samsung DA29-10105J are NSF-certified but tend to show wear and tear faster with heavy water usage.

**Value Proposition**

I’ll admit, comparing this inline filter to other brands submerged me into a rabbit hole of analysis. In the end, the value here lies in its tailored offerings without unnecessary frills. With this system, Waterdrop has aimed at a sweet spot by delivering robust chlorine and odor reduction at a moderate price. While some competitors might throw in TDS filtration or package extras, they’ll also demand a steeper upfront cost. This particular inline filter strikes just the right balance for households that need cleaner, better-tasting water without going overboard.

I started getting urinary symptoms - frequency, then transitioned into burning and pain. I was treated with bactrim. It didn’t help, but my urine came back positive for ureaplasma. I took doxycycline and retested and was negative. However urinary symptoms persisted. And they got worse. At first my bladder just felt tingly and irritated and then it turned to urethral burning and urinating a lot.

The gyno said I have a yeast infection, and that could possibly be causing urinary symptoms. He sent BV and yeast swabs. They were negative but he said those tests are pointless because the false negative rate is so high. And they did come back negative despite me clearly having yeast and vaginal redness/irritation. 

The urologist diagnosed me with overactive bladder. I got oxybutynin and hydroxyzine. At this point I avoided ALL bladder irritants and started drinking a gallon of water every day. This helped with a lot of the pain but I was peeing every 1-2 hours and my bladder capacity was significantly reduced. My urine cultures were all negative.

I was frustrated so I sent a mycogen dx urinary and vaginal PCR. The urinary one showed klebsiella in moderate amounts. The vaginal one showed streptococcus anginosus, prevotella and a few other BV anaerobic organisms, and rhodotorula (rare yeast I’ve never heard of). The urologist and gynecologist (a new one) didn’t care. I went to Dr Chat GPT and typed in every single symptom timeline, antibiotic, test, etc and it said it sounds like vaginal organisms that are causing my bladder symptoms.

I self treated with boric acid and immediately felt relief. I continued this and just started improving but still had urethral pain that was slowly resolving and would go away if I took ibuprofen. I got my nexplanon out and started bleeding a few days later. My symptoms restarted. When the period was over I started taking boric acid again and started to feel relief. I’m currently on the mend but I feel like I have my life back and might even try to have a cup of coffee for the first time in two months! I feel normal during the day but occasionally at night I will get a slight urethral ache and frequency. But I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER!!

I hope this helps someone. ",1,1758900625.0,Healthyhooha,0,1.0,False

1nr4bqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1nr4bqu/evaluate_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Evaluate the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Nespresso VertuoPlus,"Making my way through coffee machines, the Nespresso BNV420BLK1BUC1 immediately stood out for its sleek design and robust functionality. As someone who drinks espresso and larger cups of coffee in equal measure, having a machine that does both seamlessly feels like a minor miracle. It also doesn’t hurt that this device looks amazing on my kitchen countertop, with its clean black finish that complements virtually any decor. That said, I’ll break down the highs and lows of this machine based on weeks of caffeinated testing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The thoughtful design of this coffee maker is one of its standout features. At first glance, what caught my eye was its compact size, which somehow still manages to house a 60-ounce water tank. The motorized opening and closing of the brew head add an almost futuristic feel. I’ve positioned the movable water tank in different spots on my counter depending on how I organize my space, and the flexible setup is a blessing in a tighter kitchen. The buttons feel solid when pressed, and the overall finish screams premium without looking gimmicky. While it looks polished, it doesn’t snag fingerprints easily either, which is great because who’s got time to clean mid-coffee rush?

**Brewing Experience**  
Using this machine has been delightfully simple, but its brewing capabilities are where it gets really impressive. Thanks to Nespresso’s patented Centrifusion technology, the machine uses barcode reading to adjust brewing parameters for each capsule. The result? Consistent, café-quality coffee every single time. I loved brewing both an 8-ounce cup of coffee for slower mornings and a quick 1.35-ounce espresso shot for afternoons when my energy dipped. Heating up in just 25 seconds makes this machine supremely convenient. During family gatherings, it powered through multiple brews without needing excessive maintenance in between.  

[Check Nespresso BNV420BLK1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b01n5s8tv1/)

**Versatility and Features**  
Being able to brew four different cup sizes—5oz, 8oz, single, and double espresso—at just the tap of a button is a huge selling point. Pouring coffee over ice to make lattes or iced brews became my weekend treat. Though the capsule-based system may not appeal to everyone, those little capsules pack a serious flavor punch. The complimentary starter set the brand included allowed me to discover a range of options and find personal favorites. Another feature I appreciate is the energy-saving mode with its automatic shut-off function. It’s a low-key but very useful addition for someone who, like me, forgets to turn things off.  

**Advantages**  
The coffee maker ticks several boxes, especially for a single-serve espresso machine.  
- The motorized brew head makes operation effortless.  
- Fast 25-second heat-up time suits busy mornings.  
- Precise barcode brewing ensures optimal flavor extraction.  

Its ability to brew both strong espressos and lighter coffees (or even iced drinks) is a boon for households that can’t seem to agree on one style of coffee.

**Critiques**  
Nothing’s perfect, and a couple of limitations became clear after some prolonged use.  
- The capsules are expensive, which adds up quickly if you consume coffee daily.  
- While the larger water tank is great, it occupies more counter space than expected.  
- Capsule availability can sometimes feel restrictive, especially if you rely on specific blends.  

These might be minor gripes to some people, but they’re worth pondering if you’re committing to capsule-based machines.

**Competing Brands**  
I tested the VertuoPlus against a Keurig pod machine and another single-serve brewer from De’Longhi. The Nespresso completely obliterates the Keurig in terms of flavor complexity, especially with espresso shots. Compared to De’Longhi’s machines, the Nespresso wins in convenience, thanks to its capsule technology and automatic settings. Where De’Longhi might triumph is in flexibility since it can work with loose grounds. However, if hassle-free coffee perfection is your goal, the VertuoPlus takes the crown.

**Bang for the Buck**  
For its feature set, the Nespresso coffee machine offers some solid bang for your buck. While there are cheaper pod-based machines, few deliver coffee this reliably tasty or with this level of versatility. If the cost of capsules feels like a hurdle, remember you’re paying for gourmet-quality coffee without stepping into a café. It’s an indulgence, yes, but as someone who values the ritual and flavor of top-notch coffee, I consider it worthwhile.

1nr4b5z,https://i.redd.it/1wzixxc81jrf1.jpeg,Why Human Society Needs Money to Function—and Ants Don’t,"Step outside on a spring afternoon and crouch beside a crack in the sidewalk. Watch long enough and you’ll witness a miracle of coordination; an ant colony in action. No manager. No paycheck. No HR department. Just a seamless ballet of movement. Each ant hauls a crumb, tends to a larva, guards the nest. And somehow, without discussion or complaint, the colony thrives.

It is a portrait of collective effort, driven not by inspiration or ideology but by an unspoken code etched deep into their biology.

Now, look up from the sidewalk and take in the human world. It, too, hums with activity. Trucks deliver groceries to stores. Baristas hand over hot coffee. Construction crews patch up potholes before the morning commute. There is order here as well, and a strange kind of grace. But make no mistake. The choreography of humanity is not instinctive. It does not come freely. Our colonies are held together by a far more precarious thread.

Money.

Money is our substitute for instinct. It is the lever we pull to convince people to wake up early, to build bridges, to pick up trash, to nurse the sick. Without it, the mechanisms of society begin to falter. While ants need no reason to serve the greater good, humans require incentive. Remove the paycheck and the nurse may not show up. The garbage may pile high. The barista may find other things to do.

This is not a criticism of people. It is, in fact, a marvel of our design. Unlike ants, we are not born preprogrammed for community. We must choose it. And choosing is harder than knowing. To get a human colony to function, we need an elaborate system of exchange. We need banks and budgets and payrolls. We need contracts and coinage and the quiet trust that when I work, I will be compensated. And when I am compensated, I can feed my family.

But with this marvel comes fragility. The ant colony thrives precisely because it is simple. No one can opt out. There is no hoarding. No inflation. No stock market collapse. Ants do not speculate or sue or strike. We do. Our system is dynamic. It is flexible and aspirational. But it is also susceptible to breakdown.

The glue that holds us together can weaken, especially when the money stops flowing.

The pandemic was a stark reminder of this truth. When businesses shuttered and checks stopped coming, the colony wobbled. Shelves went bare. Nurses burned out. Restaurants vanished overnight. People did not suddenly forget how to work. They simply lost the means, the reason, the scaffolding that money provides. Society, we learned, is not as automatic as we might hope. It is not self-sustaining. It runs on a network of transactions so intricate that we barely notice it until it breaks.

And so, what do we make of this comparison? Are we less noble than ants? Or simply more complicated? I would argue neither. What sets us apart is not our failure to act instinctively, but our capacity to build systems to replace what nature did not give us.

Money, for all its flaws, is not just a tool of capitalism. It is a social technology. One that enables billions unrelated individual people to cooperate on a global scale.

Still, it is worth asking what might supplement it. What happens when trust erodes? When inequality rises? When people no longer believe that the colony works for them? In such moments, money alone cannot carry the weight. Then we must turn to something older. Something closer to instinct. Perhaps not altruism, but a shared sense of fate. A recognition that we rise and fall together.

The ants have their algorithm. We have ambition and imagination. And with those, the possibility of something greater. Not a colony, perhaps. But a community. One where money facilitates life but does not define it. One where cooperation is chosen, not coerced. And one where we remember, even as we count our coins, that the true measure of a society lies not only in how efficiently it functions, but also in how well it cares for the people within it.

I know building relationships at work is important, so I want to focus on improving the social skills that could help me fit in better. I’m usually good at socializing, but since this is my first real job I feel awkward all the time and completely out of my element, like I don’t even know who I am here.

 I feel like I am a really good worker who produces quality results, but networking and connecting with people is where I struggle. I’ve joined coworkers for lunch, but the conversations are mostly about their lives and they rarely ask about me. At first I didn’t mind because I thought it was a good chance to learn more about them, but after a while it started to feel one sided. I’ve also made an effort to stop by people’s desks and ask how they’re doing, and I try to follow up on things they’ve mentioned before like “how was your son’s baseball game” or “how was the concert.” The problem is those chats usually end right there and don’t go anywhere else, and it feels like no one remembers anything about me in return. I’ve even tried inviting people to lunch or coffee, but they usually say no, and then I’ll see them eating together anyway. That made me feel worse, so I stopped asking. 

I don’t expect to be best friends with coworkers, but I would like to feel included and build some rapport. The main skill I want to learn is how to keep conversations flowing so they don’t stop after small talk, and how to feel less awkward when trying to connect. 

My question is: what specific social skills or strategies can I practice to keep workplace conversations going and gradually build better connections with my team?",1,1758900359.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

I thought they were worth grading so y'all don't need to waste you're time trying to find a great one like I have.

🥇Top of the pack: Coffee By Design. Their espresso tonic is very very good. The flavor is spectacular. The espresso has depth. The bubbles are never overpowering. This is so far the gold standard, in my opinion. It has plenty of liquid (20 oz I believe), ensuring the enjoyment goes further.

🥈A Strong Substitute: Rambler Cafe. The espresso isn't as perfect, but mighty close. This is acceptable in every circumstance and you might like this one more. It is a damn tasty Espresso tonic. Another solid sized espresso tonic.

🥉Smaller Size, Less To Write Home About: Bard. The espresso tonic was small (12 oz) and overflowing with ice. I watched the barista pour only half a shot of espresso into my takeaway cup. It was $5. The flavor was ""meh"" and heavily watered down by so much ice. Do not waste your time.

❓Ungraded: Proper Cup. They only have seltzer and not tonic, but they kindly made me an espresso seltzer. It is actually decent (because their coffee is quite good), but not the same. If they got real tonic, I suspect they'd be 2nd or 3rd on this list.


Places to check:
- I can't tell if Tandem Cafe offers espresso tonics.
- Onggi has a ""cold brew tonic"". Color me intrigued.
- Moonday feels like they might make a mean one, but unclear.
- Speckled Axe has a $5 espresso tonic on their menu. Will be stopping in.
- Flatiron has a $5 espresso tonic. Gonna give it a roll.
- Another Round feels like they should have one on their menu, but don't. I bet I could get an at least okay espresso tonic here.
- Novel has a $4 espresso tonic on their menu. Potential sleeper pick.

Whereas it’s easy to condemn them for the basic things like deliberately missing meetings hours or being ‘jabri’ in general, it’s a bit tricky to do the same when religion gets involved…

In this case a student wanted for some reason to do the prayer in a public space, in his school, instead of going to a mosque or home, or maybe try to convince the school to reserve a room for prayers like a civilized person, he chose violence and tried to do it his way… why is it wrong you say? Well if you’re ok with this then you should be ok with someone who would want to do his prayer in other places : hospitals, highways, coffee shops… then it would be complete chaos as you guessed it.

As forecasted the vast majority of Tunisians think the young guy was right and the woman who tried to apply the rules is suddenly the evil one, not very surprising when you see the current state of the country.

My pov is that people need to get that ‘tjoubir’ energy out somehow, as it’s no longer socially acceptable to be ‘jabri’ in normal situations, people try to get religion involved to get that emotional cover that would easily flip the situation and make the chaotic ´jabri’ become a hero defending islam.",15,1758899852.0,Tunisia,12,0.89,False

**Ambition :** Everything is so impromptu because of Fearless. You can’t really prepare for it even if you wanted to, because the Game 5 environment is basically impossible to emulate during practice.

**Kezman :** As far as I’m aware, teams currently are emulating Fearless during scrims by mutually agreeing to exclude certain ‘important’, or meta picks. Even during free-for-all, no-restriction scrim environments, teams will purposefully pass on a certain meta champion to practice for situations where that champion is banned or eliminated.

That was something that teams would do even before Fearless. Unless it’s like a situation where you need to bring up team morale by going full tryhard in scrims, a lot of teams and players would do this kind of thing even before the implementation of Fearless.

**Ambition :** Some teams will run it on a time schedule, where they will practice tryhard, meta picks during the day and switch to practicing more experimental picks and strategies for the evening.

**Kezman :** Back to the importance of Game 1 – the result of Game 1 is probably even more important now than it was in the past due to Fearless. With the one-time usage of individual champions being enforced, that does create an environment where coaches have more of a say during draft. Although the post-game discussion of players telling coaches about what they want to play for the next game is still the case nowadays.

**Ambition :** I think that’s more of something that has to do with the player himself, rather than Fearless. At the end of the day, there’s gonna be players that are always going to be on the passive end that are more receptive to what his coaches and teammates tell him to play. Then there’s also players that make an active effort to appeal what they want to do.

**Chat :** How was the 2023 HLE team atmosphere when Grizzly had to sub in for Clid?

**Kezman :** Wasn’t anything positive – I can tell you that.l

**Ambition :** From what I’ve been told, the HLE atmosphere was like a funeral home during that time.

**Chat :** Deft has always spoke so highly of you as a coach. I hope you’re around when he’s done with his military service.

**Ambition** **:** Oh yeah. You know Deft actually asked me to play with him in the past?

**Kezman :** Like in the old-old days?

**Ambition** **:** Nope. He asked me the year I ended up retiring. I think he first signed with DragonX, then asked me saying, “Wanna play together?”

**Kezman :** Wait. So after you announced retirement?

**Ambition** **:** Nah. Right at the end of 2018, when I was basically an ugly duckling because no teams were giving me any offers.

**Kezman :** Damn. I actually wasn’t aware of this at all.

**Ambition** **:** When I got that message from Deft, I was like “F\*\*k yeah.” Partially because I now finally had a team, but also because I knew I was playing with Deft.

**Kezman :** Ok. So what ended up happening? Did KingZone just decide to go with Pyosik instead?

**Ambition** **:** Nah. It wasn’t Pyosik. They went with Cuzz for 2019. It was something that could have happened, but later didn’t end up working out with Kingzone informing me that “We don’t think this is gonna work for so and so reasons.” Damn. It’s such a shame I never had a year with Deft before retiring.

**Kezman :** Deft is like your ideal model player. If you see him, he’s up early playing League. If you don’t see him, he’s somewhere else watching League. Always playing or doing something related to League.

**Ambition** **:** I have some indirect intimacy with Deft and Heart. It was because back during CJ, they would be the only pros that would be left in high Challenger queue by 5-6AM. It was always me, and Deft-Heart queuing as a duo. It sucked at the time, because I would always be matched on the opposite side of Deft-Heart due to MMR.

**Kezman :** I can attest to how even Chinese pros were afraid of getting matched against Deft back when he was on EDG. This was the case for the players I had during my time on I May. It was so bad that we all collectively concluded that our Botlane was incapable of beating Deft regardless of what we tried. That’s why I just had the I May Botlane only alternate between Sivir and MissFortune whenever we would play EDG.

**Ambition** **:** Deft’s laning phase back then was really something. All the pros had trouble laning against Deft.

**Kezman :** It was just the constant pressure he would apply in lane while also paying attention to every little speck of detail during lane.

**Chat :** It must have been tough for Grizzly to suddenly be promoted to fill in for Clid. How did you go about caring for him as a coach near the end of 2023?

**Kezman :** It was rough for Grizzly, especially because he’s someone with a persona that’s opposite to his in-game nickname. He’s no grizzly bear. If anything, he’s the stereotypical gentle giant. But that kind of gentle nature was also something that was true of his gameplay as well, where he would be incredibly shy and passive whenever he would go on stage.

It was to where he would actively be pressured by the fact that he was playing with teammates like Zeka. There were even instances where he would be farming a camp, then back off for no reason and tell Zeka to take his camps despite Zeka not asking him for it.

But you can see how that 2023 roster can get to a CL player, right? You have Zeka to your left, and Viper to your right. So Grizzly just got more timid over time, despite him actually making a lot of right calls during his time on the main roster. He would make a good call, but then back down on it because he was so afraid that players like Zeka and Viper wouldn’t approve of it. So there came a point in time where Grizzly became mute during comms, because he couldn’t muster the courage to say what he wanted to say in front of ex-champion caliber players like Viper, Zeka and Kingen.

**Ambition** **:** I mean, that’s natural. Imagine being a CL player on a minimum salary contract that got promoted due to an emergency, and having to play with players that are being paid 5, 10, 20 times the amount you are. Very intimidating.

**Kezman :** The worst thing that could have happened was where Grizzly did come up with a call, and it ending in disaster. It has nothing to do with whether or not the call was right on Grizzly’s end. The call could have been 100% right, but the team may have failed in executing it. But nonetheless, the pressure and disappointment of “My call led to a bad result” was the worst case scenario for Grizzly – which ended up being the case.

He had a very rough time afterwards, because he lost all confidence while being part of that 2023 roster. For Grizzly, I tried approaching him with “You can easily beat the shit out of guys like Zeka, Kingen and Viper in real life, there’s no need to act scared in-game.”

**Ambition** **:** Hmm. I remember both Zeka and Kingen being really into lifting in 2023. Tough fight, no?

**Kezman :** Nah. Grizzly was literally a bear. Men aren’t supposed to fight bears. But yeah. We did have a really beefy squad in 2023 because of guys like Grizzly, Kingen and Zeka. Some other teams would jokingly call us Hanwha’s wrestling team. We played on it ourselves too, where we would jokingly tell each other to call for a pause and just go beat the crap out of the enemy team if we thought we were going to lose.

I’m not sure if this stuff ever made it on to the 2023 HLE documentary. But there was a moment where I literally did tell the players to “Just f\*\*king clear the benches if things don’t go your way, I’ll cover for you guys” at one point to try and hype them up for a game.

**Ambition** **:** It’s just that a lot of people have it the other way around, where the bigger guys are usually more on the gentle end.

**Kezman :** It would have been best for Grizzly if things just kind of magically worked out on-stage. That way, I really think he would have been able to showcase what he was really capable of with more confidence.

**Chat :** If 2018 Ambition was still active in the proscene right now, how much do you think his salary would be worth?

**Ambition** **:** Wait, wait. Ambition after 2018? Or Ambition going into 2018?

**Kezman :** Yeah. Especially because the latter is Ambition right after he won Worlds. In the League scene, having a ‘Worlds Champion’ line on your resume pumps your player contract so, so much.

**Ambition** **:** So it’s a difference between Ambition while he’s riding his Worlds Champion high, or Ambition near the end of his career. It’s weird, but that’s kind of the way it was for me. Only a 1 year difference between my prime and my last days.

**Kezman :** What does all the number 15 spam in chat mean?

**Ambition** **:** Oh. That’s 2018 GenG’s Worlds result, where we went 1-5 in Groups and finished last at Busan. Wait. You were there too, because it was RNG, C9 and Vitality that were in Group B with us. Wait, yeah. Don’t you remember calling me out to get a cup of coffee at a nearby café in Busan once we bombed out of Groups?

**Kezman :** Yeah, we went 1-1 against C9 and Vitality in Groups. You guys were the only team we went 2-0 against in Group B that year. Even I felt so bad for you guys back then, because an LCK team being last in Groups as 1-5 was so shocking. That’s why I called you out for a cup of coffee, because I wanted to see if you were doing OK.

What’s funny is that we ended up playing our Quarterfinals match against G2 the day after we had our little meet, and ended up losing 2:3. I jokingly blame you for that loss, because I feel your bad luck rubbed off on me that day at the café.

**Ambition** **:** All right then. How much would you pay for post-2017 Worlds, prime-condition Ambition?

**Kezman :** Well, that would depend on how much money I have.

**Ambition** **:** Let’s say 7 million dollars. Hypothetically.

**Kezman :** Hmm. If I had a budget of 7 million dollars, I’d probably spend half of it on Mid-Jungle alone. 1.5 million on Jungle, and 2 million on the Midlane. Then maybe something around 2 million on ADC.

**Ambition** **:** Interesting. So you’re the kind of person that would rather spend on ADC and Mid-Jungle than the Toplane.

**Kezman :** From my experience, I’ve learned that the Toplane isn’t too important. Well, relatively less important, considering you’re under a budget constraint. Toplane indeed is important, it’s just that I feel the money could potentially yield better results if invested in a more influential lane.

**Ambition** **:** So let’s say you have to choose between paying for an ADC and Toplaner.

**Kezman :** 100% ADC. No doubt. But I do know people have differing preferences when it comes to this, and this is just how I look at it.

**Ambition** **:** Hmm. On a side note, let me ask you about another contentious topic. Is League a lane-focused game, or a Jungle-focused game? I personally lie on the lane-focused side.

**Kezman :** For me, Jungle-focused. My reasoning for it is that the proficiency and skill of a Jungler determines the difficulty of the game that’s being played, which also includes things like the laning phase. Not to say that one is ultimately more important than the other though. It’s a symbiotic relationship, where better laners make the game easier to play for a Jungler, and a better Jungler makes the game easier to play for laners.

**Ambition** **:** Right, because decisionmaking as a Jungler becomes so easy if your laners are able to play out their lane matchups as they’re supposed to.

**Kezman :** Same goes the other way around, where a good Jungler has the ability to flip a matchup to where the losing side becomes more favored.

**Ambition** **:** But the jungle diff required to make a losing side of a matchup win is so huge.

**Kezman :** Exactly. That’s why I would rather prefer having an extremely good Jungler over anything else, because that player can pull things like that off. This discussion is actually very interesting. Ok, how about when it comes to the early-game? Between laners and junglers, who do you think is more responsible for setting up how an earlygame goes?

**Ambition** **:** Well, you’re then leaving draft out of the question, which is something I personally feel has the most impact on how an earlygame goes.

**Kezman :** Ok, assume the draft is 50-50. Well, I guess there are no clean 50-50s in draft. But let’s assume it is, for the sake of discussion.

**Ambition** **:** Hmm. So let’s say both sides are playing an exact mirror matchup. Clean 50-50. Let’s set some ground rules though. We’re both in agreement that the Midlane is #1 and Support is #5 in terms of importance and influence, right? So it comes down to how the other 3 positions are ranked between #2-4, which I feel differs a lot from person to person

**Kezman :** I would have to say it’s most influenced by what kind of environment that person was exposed to. Think of it like this. For me, I was able to achieve the most amount of success in my career on a team with a strong ADC and ADC-centric style. So when it comes to my personal League philosophy, ADC is the most important. Most important, assuming that Midlane being king is a given.

**Ambition** **:** Ok. So let’s go back to money, and rank how much your willingness to spend on each lane, top to bottom.

**Kezman :** For me, it would be Midlane – ADC – Jungle – Toplane – Support, in order.

**Ambition** **:** I feel like that’s an order a lot of people would be able to get behind. Definitely one of the more popular combinations.

**Kezman :** Midlane will always be #1, because a strong Midlaner is required for a strong team. You cannot, and never will have a strong team with a weak Midlane.

**Chat :** How did scrims go for RNG during 2018 Worlds? Rumors have it that iG and RNG were just steamrolling everybody during scrims that year.

**Kezman :** I get really embarrassed whenever anybody asks me about 2018 Worlds, because I couldn’t stop myself from getting cocky at the time. During the course of 2018 Worlds, we played 60 scrim games. Of which we won 58, with the 2 being lost because we were straight up playing experimental champions.

**Ambition** **:** Yeah. I do remember RNG being around that level of unstoppable during 2018 Worlds scrims.

**Kezman :** It got to a point where we weren’t gaining anything from practicing since we were winning all the time. We would actively play different non-meta and off-meta champions, and still end up winning regardless. I remember that 2018 Worlds run very, very clearly. Down to every last detail. The record might be slightly off, but it was either 56 or 58 wins out of 60 scrim games played.

**Ambition** **:** Aha. So you guys pretty much scrimbucked yourselves, where you ended up losing because you didn’t lose before.

**Kezman :** Yeah. We weren’t able to figure out why we lost on stage, because ‘losing’ was just something that was so unfamiliar to us at the time. I’m not even kidding. We would lose, and none of us would know why we lost.

**Ambition** **:** What’s funny is that we had an inside joke in 2018 SSG where we all blamed Ruler for the reason why RNG ended up getting eliminated in Quarterfinals. There was that Group B game we played against each other, where Ruler as Xayah with both Flash and Featherstorm up allowed Letme to get a freebie Sion Ult crash on to him.

So the entire joke was that Ruler making that big of a mistake lulled you guys into a false sense of security, where we would rip of Ruler saying “RNG would have come to their senses and made a deeper run if you dodged that Sion ult.” The 2018 SSG members still make this joke to this day whenever we see Ruler. “Hey Ruler, why did you wintrade against Letme during 2018 Worlds?”

**Kezman :** Was that the game where we managed to pick Ruler off 10 seconds before his Cleanse was back up? You know, that game where we managed to get the full Malzahar tether on him.

**Ambition** **:** Nah. It was the game where Letme was on Sion, and Crown was playing something like Lulu or Karma Mid. I remember because we were the only team using utility support midlaners at the time, given that we were a botlane one-trick team. Our composition was always Cuvee on an island, me on a tank Jungler, Crown on a utility support Midlaner, and an all-in carry pick for Ruler.

Yeah. I remember. It was the 2^(nd) game of Group B where it was the first stage game between SSG and RNG. We actually had Cuvee play Camllle that game. I remember because all of us thought that we would win because Cuvee was absolutely hard-bullying Letme’s Sion with the Camille.

**Kezman :** Ohh. Ohhhh. I remember. Yeah, that game where Ruler got rammed by Letme’s Sion Ult in Midlane with both Xayah R and Flash up.

**Ambition** **:** Yeah. It was literally a desperation play from Letme, where it was him going “I can’t deal with the Camille, so either this desperation play onto Xayah works, or we just GG.” Ruler falling for that play was the problem, where you guys ended up winning off that play.

**Kezman :** If we had ended up losing that game, I feel that loss could have been the wake-up call we never got. Oh well. Actually, I don’t know if things would have been different. Back then, we had absolute, unwavering trust in Uzi’s Kaisa and Xayah. He would always win both sides of the matchup in such dominant fashion that I’m not sure if that loss would have been enough for us to doubt it.

That’s kind of why draft was so easy for 2018 RNG, because we would go through pick-ban with 100% confidence that we would be guaranteed to win as long as we got either Xayah or Kaisa. That, and we really didn’t think of losing as a possibility. Think about it. Going 95%+ winrate during Worlds scrims, winning Gold in the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games, and also basically golden-roading every tournament of 2018 up until Worlds.

**Ambition** **:** Asian Games? Ohh, right. That’s when they first added League as an exhibition match during the 2018 Asian Games, and you were coaching the Chinese roster that won.

**Kezman :** In chronological order : LPL Spring, MSI, Asian Games, LPL Summer and Rift Rivals. You can kind of see how confident we were heading into Worlds, right? We had won every tournament up until then, and felt as if we were actually unstoppable. It was that kind momentum that led to the 58/60 scrim record, where it legitimately made us feel that we weren’t getting any good out of practice since we were winning so hard.

**Ambition** **:** When it gets to that extreme of a situation, don’t you get nervous? Like in terms of becoming more careful because you think a loss is due.

**Kezman :** That’s why I always look back on 2018 in embarrassment, because I had also wholly subscribed to the notion that we were unstoppable. As the head coach, it was unacceptable for me to fall into that kind of mannerism. Even if the players had felt that way, I should have kept my head clear as the head coach and kept everything in line.

This may sound like a pretty bad excuse, but it was so hard for me to keep things in line. We were legitimately playing so well to where I couldn’t critique or give the players any negative reinforcement whatsoever. The only way I could was to bring up mistakes they had made like 3-4 months prior. I did feel that a stern, be-serious kind of coaching moment was necessary heading up to Worlds – but I couldn’t come up with anything to base it off of. The team was playing so well to where I thought conserving the winning mentality we had throughout 2018 was just going to be enough.

**Ambition** **:** Aha. So that’s why the upset loss against G2 at Quarterfinals came as such a shock. How did G2 do that tournament?

**Kezman :** G2 beat us 3:2 in Quarters, along with iG also beating KT 3:2 as well. G2 lost 0:3 to iG in Semis, where iG proceeded to win the Finals match. I don’t remember who their finals opponent was, because I didn’t watch the tournament after we were knocked out.

**Ambition** **:** It was FNC. iG 3:0ed FNC for the win.

**Kezman :** Ah, right. But yeah, I think our loss came as a shock to everyone, because everyone was expecting an LPL civil war between us and iG in the Semifinal;s.

**Ambition** **:** The SSG version of the 2018 story is much different. We would get our asses beat in scrims. Hard. Like 20% winrate hard. To a point where we were actively injecting ourselves with “It’ll be different once we play on stage, promise” copium. Turns out, it wasn’t any different.

It wasn’t just Worlds that was bad for us though. All throughout that entire 2018 season, I don’t think SSG ever had a single moment where our scrim winrate surpassed 50%. Actually, that also applies to my entire time at Samsung. For all three years, 2016, 2017, 2018 – there was not a single instance where Samsung’s winrate in scrims exceeded 50%. Not once.

That’s kind of where that Worlds copium came from in 2018. We had a confidence of sorts, where we were banking on stage games being different because we had gone all the way up to a Worlds Championship from a sub-50% scrim winrate team. Like we kind of had a positive loser’s mindset, where confident because we had experienced how much losers could achieve in 2016 and 2017.

**Kezman :** One team that I am rooting for in the LCK right now is GenG. Because Chovy is on GenG, and I always like supporting players that I’ve spent time with in the past. So one thing that I do worry for GenG is how difficult it is to extract meaningful data from games when you’re at the top. I’ve been in that position in 2018 when RNG was so super-dominant, where it’s near impossible to evolve as #1. You can try and play some experimental pick here and do some weird off-brand strategy there – but even they don’t usually result in any meaningful conclusions. So one thing I fear for when it comes to GenG’s remainder of the season is the possibility of them accidentally trapping themselves within their own draft and strategy bubble because they have been so consistently dominant.

**Ambition** **:** Yeah. Getting to #1 is one thing, but keeping that #1 title is a much difficult task.

**Kezman :** That’s why I do think GenG being introduced to some kind of crisis during Playoffs will do them a lot of good in the long-run, especially for Worlds. Because I had experienced what became of 2018 RNG at the very end of the season, I’m a firm believer that losing at a relatively less-critical moment in the season actually does you so much good. To a point where I think those kinds of losses are required for a team to eventually end up at the top.

**Ambition** **:** Yeah. That’s why I’ve consistently believed that dropping a game or two during Groups is actually very beneficial for a team’s Worlds outlook. Well, at least when it comes to Korean and Chinese teams, that is.

**Kezman :** Exactly. And it does more good the more outrageous the loss is. The benefit of that loss comes from the shock factor, and how it figuratively zaps you into place, right? So it’s effect becomes more defined if that loss was against a team that you had no business losing against.

**Ambition** **:** That’s actually funny, because 2017 SSG nearly losing to Fenerbahce from TCL during Worlds 2017 Groups was the shock factor that got us all in line. That’s the adrenaline-shot game that turned Cuvee into an entirely different player for the rest of the tournament, which was a big reason behind why we won.

**Kezman :** I guess that’s how Groups and Swiss Stage has always been, in terms of being both a hectic training ground of different drafts, but also in terms of being a preliminary, ‘getting a feel for the tournament’ kind of portion of Worlds. That’s why we see so many different kinds of drafts and champions be brought out during Groups and Swiss Stage, right? We go from that, to a more standardized draft, where Quarterfinals forwards is a battle of how well each team was able to organize their respective tierlists.

**Ambition** **:** It’s also why we see a lot of surprise, or pocket picks be utilized more during the first-half of the tournament, for them to only be used as a very niche, one-time thing in the latter tournament stage. This largely has to do with how each region as their own ‘secret weapon’ in terms of pocket picks, where it’s almost always something different for every region during Worlds. This is also the reason why we see certain teams from certain regions always try out some specific niche pick from their region during Groups/Swiss, to where they will no longer use it for the rest of the tournament because they realize “Oh wait, this pick only worked in domestic because our region sucks.”

It's honestly something I find incredibly amusing about Worlds every year, because every league will have their own region-specific approach at the very beginning of the tournament. After a couple games are played, all the teams start to notice that “Oh snap, the Chinese way of doing things is so much better”, and all start copying the LPL. Some years, it’s the LPL. Some years, it’s the LCK, or even LEC. It’s funny how all those Korean, Chinese and European perspectives all clash in the beginning of the tournament, and seemingly converge by the time the tournament stage begins.

**Kezman :** The time I was coaching in China was when the LPL took international tournaments incredibly seriously. The entire league treated it as if their own lives depended on it. I’m not exactly sure how things are done now, but a lot of top LPL teams during the mid-2010s already had full-fledged in-house data analyst teams. Analyst teams that would literally break down every game to every bit of detail, and hand the team a report that’s as detailed as explaining how an opponent Jungler paths based on where he places his first ward.

**Ambition** **:** Damn. I knew that the practice hours and culture had become identical to Korea after a certain point, but I didn’t even know it went that far back then.

**Kezman :** My experience in LPL with those in-house analyst squads were what taught me how important analysts were to a team. They would be the ones that would pick up on things like preferences or patterns when it came to things like Lv1s, to which we would make extremely good use of in-game. This is one reason why LPL teams were so good at dismantling games before the laning phase even got to begin during the mid-late 2010s.

**Chat :** Predictions for LCK Playoffs?

**Kezman :** Let’s see. So it’s KT and HLE in the Winner’s Bracket, and T1 and GenG in the Loser’s Bracket. Along with DK and BFX fighting at the very bottom.

**Ambition** **:** Let’s start with DK and BFX. I’m leaning towards BFX.

**Kezman :** In terms of raw team strength or what we refer to as ‘weight class’, DK should be favored to win. But BFX are on a roll right now, right? Like you can tell that they’re on the up-and-up, even from their gameplay. It would be a bit disrespectful or inappropriate of me to go into analyzing the matchup in more detail, but I do want to give BFX props for making it this far. Oh yeah, Diable looks really good too. He’s that type of ADC that plays while being 100% aware of all his kill angles, and it’s very fun to watch.

Ugh. It’s really tough for me to say things outright about teams and players that are in competition now, because I’m someone that’s still involved in the industry. I would 100% be down to drop a more direct, unfiltered take on teams and players if I didn’t have anything on the line. If I was 40-year old retired coach, transitioned streamer Kezman – I would be going off right now.

**Ambition** **:** You never know. Hard to say who is what and which is that when you might be on the same team next year. Awkward moment when a player walks up to you in the middle of the season and asks, “Hey coach, why did you say that about me last year?”

**Chat :** Who were the players you coached throughout your career that were ‘generational talent’, or guys that were outstandingly more talented than the rest?

**Kezman :** As a coach, you instantly get the “This kid is the real deal” realization the moment you see a player with that kind of outstanding talent. If we’re talking about pure talent only – it would have to be Chovy. With Chovy, you get this outstanding luxury as a coach of making the assumption that your Midlane is never going to lose, regardless of what you pick him. He’s a sort of player that makes losing very hard to imagine – which is something that’s beyond crazy if you put it in to perspective.

What’s funny is that his talent also passes in the Toplane as well. I don’t know how well this is known, but Chovy did make an active appeal to play Toplane early in his career.

**Ambition** **:** He did compete as GenG’s Toplaner for that Korea-China interregional event match and end up beating guys like Bin too, right?

**Kezman :** In 2021, we actually did try some scrims with Chovy as our Toplaner, with someone else just playing a utility support champion in the Midlane.

**Ambition** **:** Nah. It would be such a waste for Chovy to be anything but a Midlaner though. Talent like that belongs in the Midlane.

**Chat :** Do you guys know how Daydream, Emperor and Shy are doing nowadays?

**Kezman :** Shy is working in the LoL space, though I won’t disclose details since that’s his personal life.

**Chat :** He did announce that he was working as an analyst for PS.

**Ambition** **:** I think the last time I saw Emperor was at my own wedding. Don’t think I’ve talked to him since.

**Kezman :** I’ve talked to Emperor recently on the League client. He’s doing well. Just the same old Busan-man he always us. Just living life. I’m not sure about Daydream. Probably somewhere in Japan playing a rhythm game.

**Ambition** **:** Daydream is probably the one person with the most amount of raw gaming talent. This was back during CJ, when Netmarble had us advertise a new game they had just released. It was some pirate-themed AOS game.

**Chat :** Pirates: Treasure Hunter?

**Ambition** **:** Yeah. It was that. All throughout the adshoot, Daydream would just be styling on us.

**Kezman :** It was all our first time playing too, because they asked for a more ‘raw’ experience. So all of us had just been briefed on what the game was about, with everyone just having a little under an hour of gameplay.

**Ambition** **:** Yeah. He’s definitely the type of guy that plays and relies on his talent. That’s kind of how he was like as a player too, where he would just brush things off. Flame would always be yelling at him because of a mistake Daydream made, and Daydream would always be “Naaaah, I won’t do it again, trust. Just go next.”

**Kezman :** Every player used to have his specialty, with some having more specialties than others. For you, your specialty was always PC games. You were good at anything that involved a keyboard and a mouse for input, regardless of genre. But when it came to console games, you were so, so bad. I remember how none of us on CJ let you play with the PS4 after seeing you wander in circles because you couldn’t pathfind at all. I remember all the guys playing games like Sekiro and Elden Ring in their off-time, but you would never even go near the PS4 after that.

**Ambition** **:** I’m more of the kind of gamer that has a hard time settling down, but really enjoys the process of limit testing once I’ve ‘beat’ the game, so to speak. I feel it’s the reason I was able to become a pro in the first place, because I had that drive within to constantly try for a higher goal.

I think both fall into the area of talent, just in different areas. When it comes to modern proplay, I think it’s much difficult than it was before because it requires both. You can’t be like me or Daydream separately, but a 2-in-1. You need to be both talented at the game itself, and also be naturally inclined to enjoy and excel at the process of constantly renewing a ceiling.

**Kezman :** When it comes to League, I think a lot of people reminisce for the days where we had a constant influx of new talent that was flooding the scene. With that constant and massive supply of new players making the scene a lot more interesting and amusing to watch.

We’ve now approached a stage where becoming a professional player is extremely, extremely difficult. ‘Good’ talent that might have secured you a professional debut in the past will get you nowhere close to the main stage nowadays. It’s not just a matter of crazy amounts of talent and skill, but you also have to pass the hoop of being able to show 100% of it when you’re given the opportunity. That’s what makes the path to being a professional player in Korea the hardest it’s ever been.

**Ambition** **:** I’ve noticed that. We’re now in an era where we get like 1, or maybe 2 noteworthy talent every year across all 5 positions.

**Kezman :** The current LCK scene is lucky if it even comes across 1 new promising talent yearly. In addition, the entire league has pretty much adopted the notion of preferring veteran players in their roster over rookies for a while now. This is because over the past couple years, the veterans have proven that they’re more than capable of keeping the upcoming young blood in check with their old tricks alone. The wolf cubs try and rise up to take their spots, but their efforts are rendered useless by the years of tricks the ‘old dogs’ have learned throughout the years. Experience trumps new talent – that’s where we’re at right now.

The only way these new players can catch up is to either spend as much time as the veteran players on stage to catch up, or either be given the opportunity on a top team to experience multiple years’ worth of professional knowhow in a single season.

The youth system we have set in place will continue to produce new talent. But with the process of becoming a professional player so much more difficult now than it was in the past – we’re kind of in a weird spot. Take a moment and consider who is capable, or will take the place of players like Faker, Chovy, Bdd, Ruler and Viper if they were to retire within the near future.

The answers don’t come easy, right? Sure, some lanes may be more easily answered than others. For example, we got Diable this year for ADC. But think of the Midlane, and think of who will be in a position to surpass, or even be in a position to try and match the mountains that Midlaners like Faker, Chovy and Bdd have amounted.

**Ambition** **:** You’re right. We don’t really have a clear set, or even a single candidate for the next-generation Midlaner.

**Kezman :** The situation isn’t that much better when it comes to other lanes too. For ADC, we barely just got Diable this year. For Toplane, Siwoo is just about it.

I’ll try and put this into perspective for everyone. Bdd was in CJ’s secondary roster when Ambition was a Midlaner on CJ. That’s early-mid 2010s. It’s been 10 years – and he’s put up this monster of a performance this season.

**Ambition** **:** That’s kinda crazy if you really take a moment to think about it. 10 years ago, I remember how we were iffy about signing Bdd on our Challenger roster because his weakness was teamplay. We went from that to now. Dang.

**Kezman :** Exactly. He was literally the stereotypical Zed-onetrick assassin player back then. That’s actually why he forced him to play Azir only when it was released in 2014.

**Ambition** **:** Damn. I actually remember how we used to mix up the main and challenger CJ roster to do in-house scrims, and how a lot of the guys on the main roster would always complain about how Bdd would never call out his plays on the comms. He would pick Ahri, say nothing for 10 minutes, then all of a sudden say “I’m going in”, followed by a “Sorry, I died” 5 seconds later.

**Kezman :** We went from that, to a player that now makes all the calls and is also known as the Azir guy. It’s actually kind of wild to think that we legit only signed him because he was so good on Zed. Damn, that CJ junior roster in 2014 went kind of hard. Helper was in the Toplane, who’s currently coaching for GenG. Then we had Trick, Bdd, Ghost, and Max. So much talent in that one challenger roster from over 10 years ago.

**Ambition** **:** Huh. Funny how Ghost ended up being the guy that found the most success in that roster, with him being the only one with a Worlds trophy. Especially because one of the main reasons we ever signed Ghost onto our CJ junior roster was because he was friends with Bdd, and not because he was actually that good or anything.

**Kezman :** Oh yeah. I remember being the one that told you this. So what happened was that when we signed Bdd, he said outright that he wanted to play with his friend that went by the name Ghost. So we went and gave Ghost a tryout opportunity, where he did show some promise. It wasn’t where he only got signed because he was a Bdd nepo-friend. We definitely did see some promise, where we thought that we could get Ghost to work if we gave him the right experience and practice.

Besides, Ghost was 2 years below the LCK pro debut age limit when this all went down. So we were signing him under the assumption that CJ’s LoL project was going to continue, and that we were going to feed Ghost around 2 years of professional experience by having him on our junior team. That was kind of the plan we had for both Bdd and Ghost, where we were going to surprise debut them once they became of age in 2016.

**Ambition** **:** A lot of the guys on the main CJ roster actually ended up thinking that Ghost was the best part of the CJ junior roster. Bdd was a Zed-onetrick, Helper was a Rumble-onetrick. But I remember Ghost being the one guy that all the main roster players approved of, to where we would sometimes even say that he was better than Space.

That reminds me. I think this was during 2014, when you would randomize the main and junior roster together for in-house 5v5s. Those practice games went so well for Ghost, to where there was this atmosphere of people thinking Ghost being better than space throughout the team. None of us would say it outright out of respect for Space, but everyone kind of felt it.

Space isn’t the kind of guy that gets angry or mad over anything. He’s always been the jolly good fellow that we all found impossible to piss off. But that one instance was where we saw this uncharacteristic Space moment, where he wiped every bit of smile from his face and proceeded to absolutely smurf on Space out of anger. We never joked about “Ghost > Space” after that.",5,1758899850.0,leagueoflegends,0,1.0,False

1nr42g4,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1nr42g4/should_you_buy_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Supreme,"The Keurig K-Supreme is a coffee maker I’ve grown oddly attached to after using it daily. I first got it because I was desperate for a reliable single-serve brewer that didn’t make my kitchen counter look like a chaotic science experiment. The blend of its sleek design, ease of use, and the much-hyped MultiStream Technology caught my attention. Being a coffee snob, I’ve tested this machine to see if it lives up to the promises—or just contributes to the landfill pile of disappointing appliances.

**Sleek Aesthetic and Practical Design**  
Right out of the box, this coffee maker felt thoughtful in its design. The Keurig K-Supreme comes in an unobtrusive black finish with modern lines that don’t scream for attention but complement the kitchen decor gracefully. At 10.12 inches deep and almost 15 inches wide, it manages to balance compactness with practicality. The dual-position 66-oz removable reservoir is a godsend because you can adjust it to fit your counter space needs—or in my case, avoid knocking it over during my perpetual morning clumsiness. It’s also fairly lightweight, which made unboxing and setting up an easy task, though I did question how durable it might be over time with frequent moving.

**Key Benefits**  
• MultiStream Technology offers fuller extraction of coffee flavors and aroma.  
• Multiple brew sizes—choose between 6, 8, 10, or 12 ounces.  
• Dual-position reservoir for flexible placement on your countertop.  

[Find the best price for Keurig K-Supreme on Amazon.](https://triopd.com/p/b0892tw82k/)

**MultiStream Technology and Brewing Performance**  
This feature intrigued me the most. Instead of just one stream of water saturating the coffee pods, this machine uses multiple streams to extract flavor evenly. I tested this claim excessively, comparing the brew quality to my old single-serve machine. There’s a noticeable depth to the flavor here that the competition didn’t capture. I even tried it with my favorite K-Cup, and the aroma genuinely felt more inviting. Plus, for those who love their coffee with a punch, the Strong button delivers a more concentrated brew—it’s like a caffeine wake-up slap.

That said, the brewing process is impressively fast. It takes only a few minutes to churn out a hot, fresh cup with minimal noise. However, back-to-back brewing sometimes caused a minor delay when I was in a hurry. While it promises no reheating downtime, there’s still a slight pause that’s not as instantaneous as I imagined.

**Versatile Coffee Options**  
For anyone as indecisive as me, having the ability to brew either hot, rich coffee or pour it over ice for refreshingly cool beverages feels like a luxury. Brewing iced coffee was better than I thought—a rich coffee concentrate that didn’t taste watered down. Truthfully, this feature might save me from overpaying for iced lattes elsewhere. But I’ll confess, I wish there was a built-in frother or milk steamer at this price point to complete my barista roleplay.

**Drawbacks**  
• The machine lacks premium features like a digital screen or milk frother.  
• The coffee quality is highly dependent on the type of K-Cup pod.  
• Back-to-back brewing isn’t as seamless as claimed.  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
The freedom to operate this machine via button controls made it straightforward enough that even my coffee-challenged coworker couldn't mess it up. Insert the pod, hit the button, and coffee magic ensues. It accommodates mugs up to 7 inches tall, which worked great with my travel cup. Cleaning was equally effortless, thanks to clear maintenance reminders and a removable reservoir. However, if you’re not prompt about descaling (set at every 250 brews), the machine can give you a passive-aggressive warning that’s hard to ignore.

**Competing Brands**  
Among competitors, the Nespresso VertuoLine was seriously tempting before I bought this model. The coffee itself feels slightly more high-end, especially with its crema addition for espresso lovers. However, it’s more expensive upfront and doesn’t offer as much flexibility in pod variety or size options. Another alternative was the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which allows both K-Cups and ground coffee. While it offers more brewing options, its bulkier size and slower performance ultimately made me stick to the Keurig K-Supreme.

**Affordable Quality**  
In terms of price-to-quality ratio, I’d say this coffee maker strikes the right balance for frequent users who care about consistency and flavor variety. Sure, it’s a bit more expensive than basic single-serve models, but the MultiStream Technology and flexibility to brew iced coffee or different sizes make it worth it. If you’re particular about your coffee’s richness but don’t want to spend a fortune, this machine feels like a sweet spot between affordability and premium brewing features.

The province carries the name of **Sultan Muhammad Dipatuan Kudarat**, the 17th-century Maguindanaon ruler who defended his people’s autonomy against Spanish incursions and forged alliances that outlasted fleets. His legacy—statecraft rooted in community and faith—still echoes in today’s town plazas, seaside markets, and upland settlements.

Sultan Kudarat’s story is a braid of many strands. The **Maguindanaon** heartland shaped its language, food, music, and ceremonies—*kanduli* thanksgiving feasts, the bright shimmer of brass gongs, and evenings when **kulintang** rhythms carry across river villages. Along the coasts of **Lebak** and **Kalamansig**, fishing towns wake before dawn, and trade has long flowed in and out with the tides. In the interior, the **Dulangan Manobo**, **Teduray**, and **B’laan** keep oral histories alive through weaving, beadwork, and ritual, reminding neighbors that the mountains hold memories as deep as the sea.

Change arrived in waves: colonial campaigns that never fully subdued the sultanates; American roads and surveys; postwar migration that brought **Ilonggo, Ilocano, and Cebuano** settlers to farm new fields and open shops. The province itself was carved from the old Cotabato in the 1970s, and **Isulan** grew into a pragmatic capital—part marketplace, part crossroads, where Moro, IP, and settler families do business across faiths and surnames. On feast days, mosques and churches fill in turn; on ordinary mornings, everyone meets at the same stalls for coffee, *pastil*, and news.

Culture here is not a museum piece—it is negotiated daily. Festivals like **Tacurong’s Talakudong** celebrate identity through dance, drums, and the iconic hat; barangay rites blend custom and modernity; youth groups remix kulintang with contemporary beats and post it online. Even governance borrows from heritage: consultative meetings feel like extended clan councils, and public pledges are measured not just in metrics but in the quiet test of everyday fairness.

To say “The Sultan Kudarat Begins” is to remember that each administration inherits a deeper timeline. The province’s strengths—hospitality, resilience, and a habit of partnership across communities—were not invented this year; they were honed over centuries of trade winds, river journeys, and shared harvests. As new leaders set priorities and residents weigh promises against practical needs, the past offers both compass and caution: progress that endures usually starts with listening, and the most durable plans are those that make room for every voice—Moro, IP, and settler alike.

In a place named for a sultan who understood power as responsibility to people and place, the work of “beginning” is never just political. It is cultural: keeping languages audible in classrooms and markets, keeping rituals meaningful without closing the door to change, keeping history alive enough to guide tomorrow. Here, that work continues—quietly in workshops and kitchens, loudly in parades and gongs—one story, one family, one barangay at a time.",1,1758899797.0,TheSultans,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Washington Nationals vs. Chicago White Sox: A Tale of Two Troughs**  
The Washington Nationals (-130) and Chicago White Sox (+210) are set to clash in what might be the most statistically anemic duel of the season. Both teams are playoff contenders… in the ""how many ways can you botch a baseball game?"" sweepstakes. Let’s break this down with the mathematical precision of a toddler counting candy and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s seen too many rain delays.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why This Feels Like a Coin Flip Hosted by a Casino

The Nationals are -130 favorites, implying a 56.5% chance to win. For context, that’s about the same odds as correctly guessing whether a baseball will bounce left or right off a umpire’s shins after a wild pitch. The White Sox, at +210, suggest bookmakers think they have a 32.3% chance—roughly the likelihood of a relief pitcher throwing a complete game.

Historically, Washington has won only 20% of games when favored by -130 or more this season. Chicago, meanwhile, has defied underdog odds at a 36.8% clip. Translation: The White Sox are the definition of a “sleeper pick” if your idea of sleeping involves tossing and turning in a cold, damp cellar.

---

### Statistical Shenanigans: When “Bad” Meets “Worse”

**Washington Nationals (65-94):**

* **Offense:** Hitting .219 as a team, but their recent power surge is enough to make a toaster blush—10 home runs in 10 games. Star slugger Daylen Lile is a .400 hitter, which is either a miracle or a typo.
* **Pitching:** A 6.20 ERA over their last 10 games. Their starters allow home runs like a bad ex allows emotional damage. Cade Cavalli (4.23 ERA) starts, which is “good” by Washington standards—think of it as the difference between drowning in a kiddie pool vs. a kiddie pool with a single drop of water.

**Chicago White Sox (58-101):**

* **Offense:** A .181 team batting average. For context, that’s worse than a group of interns on their first day at a coffee shop. They do hit 8 HRs in 10 games, though, which is like a dying firework going “boom” one last time. Migue

1nr403l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nr403l,Siemens EQ500  no/ little coffee,"Hey, 
We've got a Siemens EQ500 machine for almost 2 years now and until this morning, it worked fine.  I usually clean and decalc (our water is very hard) once a week. 

There is little to no coffer coming out of the machine,  a little bit druels down the side of the spout,  most is ""disappearing"" into the machine. 

Hot water as well as milk work perfectly fine,  coffee (no matter if bean or powder) won't enter the cup. 

From what I have gathered this may be due to a dirty brewing unit. I've cleaned it as well as I possibly can without completely taking the damn thing apart.  I've also ran the clean & calc program and nothing changed, unfortunately.  


How can I troubleshoot this thing further? Is there maybe a good step by step guide in dis and reassembling the stupid brewing unit? I'm out of ideas and lacking caffeine.....

1nr3zzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/1nr3zzq/can_anyone_relate_to_my_symptoms_im_new_scared/,"Can anyone relate to my symptoms? Im new, scared and unexperienced…","Hello all,
I experienced what I’d call my first flair in November 2024. The symptoms included a strange sensation in my penis and bladder problems such as dull pain, urgency, frequency, and worsening pain when I drank more fluids. It felt like a UTI, so I did all the tests, but they came back negative. After reading about my symptoms online, interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) came to mind immediately.
At that time, I didn’t follow any specific diet—I ate and drank everything, including coffee and alcohol. I was anxious because these sensations appeared out of nowhere. While trying to understand my symptoms, they seemed to get worse: I developed burning sensations in my private area, painkillers didn’t help, and I could hardly sleep. Eventually, I had an ultrasound of my abdominal area. Everything was normal, and the doctor reassured me that it was probably a pulled muscle. The very next day, I woke up symptom-free! I quickly forgot about it all and continued my normal daily routine. I also go to the gym regularly and take supplements. I can honestly say I lived a happy life until August 22, 2025.
Then it hit me again—with a vengeance. The same symptoms appeared out of nowhere. Of course, I panicked, which only made the flare worse. Again, I diagnosed myself with IC/PBS. This time I ate very little, felt depressed, and experienced more anxiety than ever. The burning pain lasted for days, and I felt desperate, like living in a nightmare. A heating pad on my abdomen or between my legs became my best friend, though during the worst flares even that didn’t bring relief. I couldn’t sleep, had to work the next day, and gave up coffee because I thought it might be a trigger. Some days were better than others, but whenever I felt close to normal, the pain came back even stronger.
Now I’m wondering: since I went through this before and the symptoms disappeared on their own while I was still eating and drinking whatever I wanted, maybe it’s not IC after all?
Could it be pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD)? I’m not sure whether it’s hypertonic or hypotonic. I’ve had chronic stress, and August was an especially stressful month. I also did a lot of intense physical activity the week before the symptoms started—running uphill and jumping rope with weights, which I don’t usually do.
I still have that weird sensation in my penis. Erections are difficult, though not impossible. If I clench while flaccid, it sometimes jerks or spasms. My bladder also hurts when I press on the area, even when it’s not full.
Can anyone relate or share what might be going on? I’ve been feeling better for the last two days, but overall, these symptoms have lasted for five straight weeks, and it’s been really tough.

Hi Everyone,

I’m 32, based in England, and normally I love anything outdoors—hiking, walks by the coast, exploring little villages. It still feels warm enough to be out just about! 

I’d love to find people to chat with about everyday life, swap music or book recs, share cooking ideas, or just keep each other entertained while we wait for a bit of sunshine. Ideally it would be great if it could move from online to real life—grabbing a coffee, seeing a gig, or even planning a hike or camping trip. 

A bit about me:
- Into hiking, fitness, and anything that gets me out in nature (when it’s not pouring).
- Enjoy a cosy night in with good food and a film.
- Always up for random conversation, humour, and new experiences.

-electricity (averages around $150 but fluctuates)

-renters insurance (16$)

You know how our kitchen counter used to be a graveyard for coffee gadgets? I think the drip machine was just steaming out frustration, because my coffee always tasted a bit sharp and acidic. I started wondering if I just didn't like coffee that much.



Then a friend practically forced her French press on me for a weekend. The difference was honestly shocking. It wasn't just hot brown water anymore; it was actually rich and had a real body to it. The secret is the metal filter. Unlike paper filters that trap the coffee's natural oils, the French press lets them all through. Those oils are where all the smooth, deep flavor lives.



It turned my morning routine from a caffeine transaction into a little ritual. There's something satisfying about pressing the plunger down—it feels like you're actually \*making\* something. The best part? I finally understood what people meant by coffee having ""chocolatey"" or ""nutty"" notes. It was all in there, just waiting to be let out.



It's funny how such a simple, low-tech device solved a problem that expensive machines couldn't. Now, the only drama is waiting the four minutes for it to brew.

She starts to buy him clothing items and take him to progressively nicer places and eventually reveals she wants him to come to a country club wedding with her. He suspects he is the subject of a wager a la *Pygmalion* but realized he doesn't care because the woman is attractive and has paid for everything so far.

With the newest film coming out around the holidays, I wanted to incorporate it into Christmas gifts for my friends. However, even the Socks for Ransom feel a little too intimate for work pals, especially since I'm a woman and one of them is married. 

SO, bearing that in mind, what could I use the Handsome Chris cabling on that would be recognizable but doesn't say ""I'm thinking about your bare feet""? 

I thought about a hat or a mug cozy? One loves coffee, the other doesn't but does drink tea. In case it helps to know about their personalities: One is a nerdy dog owner who likes to collect things/comicon/etc, the other is a type-A runner.

The orbit of Persephone, December 28, 2116.

Bridge of the destroyer Arthur C. Clarke.

Captain Lena Kowalska could still feel the ghost of Berlin under her eyelids and Karina's tongue between her thighs. That blissful image popped like a soap bubble. Now, after her leave, thrown into the deepest of waters, she was commanding an escort mission to the very edge of the solar system. Her task: to deliver Admiral Marcus Thorne to the dwarf planet Persephone in the Kuiper Belt. The same cold rock that now filled the main screen of the bridge had been her only cover more than two decades ago during a desperate battle with two Plague frigates. Back then, as a sergeant in the engine room of the cruiser Ivan the Terrible, she had only dreamed of surviving another hour. Today, she commanded a ""Hammer-class"" destroyer, and the memories of that fight tasted like metallic dust on her tongue.

""Admiral, we are in position,"" she said into the intercom, her calm and controlled voice echoing in the professional silence of the bridge. Each of her officers was focused on their station, but Lena could feel their collective tension.

""I know, I'm on my way,"" the admiral replied curtly. His voice was like the grinding of gravel.

A moment later, the heavy bulkhead doors opened with a hiss, and Admiral Marcus Thorne stepped onto the bridge. He walked over to Lena, giving her a brief but appreciative glance, then his attention focused on the large screen. And for a moment, he froze.

What he saw went beyond the worst-case scenarios drawn up by intelligence analysts. Yes, there were Earth ships there, circling like nervous sheepdogs. But the background behind them... the background was black with dozens, if not hundreds, of Ullaan ships. Smaller than an Earth destroyer, their silhouettes, resembling arrowheads, were completely black. They emitted virtually no heat radiation and absorbed radar waves like a sponge. If not for the faint, pulsating navigation lights, even the human eye would have had difficulty spotting them against the cosmic void. They looked like holes in reality.

""God... how fast they build these ships,"" Thorne sighed with a mixture of admiration and genuine dread. He ran a hand over his face. ""How is this even possible? It's only been six months since I gave my approval. And only three months since their mobile shipyard even got here and began orbiting Persephone.""

""Admiral, take a look at this,"" Lena pointed to a second, smaller screen, while simultaneously giving a quiet order to the tactical officer. ""Magnify the mining zone, sector 2.""

Marcus immediately shifted his gaze. The sight was even more disturbing. The surface of the dwarf planet, a scene from a mining engineer's dream paradise, was dotted with hundreds of gigantic, perfectly smooth cylinders.

""Do you see those structures? Those cylinders of material?"" Lena continued, modulating her voice to sound purely informational, though she herself felt a shiver run down her spine.

""Yes, I see them. What are they?""

""They are concentrated, almost pure elements. Iron, nickel, zinc, titanium, copper... all sorted with 98% accuracy by their micromachines. These cylinders are transported by larger drones from the surface of Persephone straight to their mobile shipyard, and then used to 3D print entire sections of a ship. I, Captain Lena Kowalska, personally witnessed on my last patrol how a ship with a mass of about 6,000 Earth tons was printed in less than four days. Our guardsman, Sergeant Newmann, who knows a few words of their language and has a better rapport with them, says that a ship is eighty percent complete right after printing. It already has its armor, structure, basic wiring. Only then do their technicians and engineers go inside to finish assembling the systems that can't be printed—parts of the reactors, computers, life support systems.""

""We must have this technology,"" Thorne muttered, more to himself than to Lena. ""For us to achieve one-tenth of this pace, we had to switch to a war economy. People had ration cards for food and kettles, and they're printing a fleet from space debris.""

""We have an incoming transmission from the Ullaan, Admiral. From the main shipyard.""

""On screen,"" Lena commanded, straightening up in her chair.

The monitor flickered and the calm, almost statuesque face of Alaj Walionus appeared. His skin had the hue of porcelain, and his eyes shone like silver. He looked like an elf from Earth's tales.

""Welcome, Alaj Walionus,"" Marcus began, trying to keep his voice neutral.

""I welcome you, Admiral Thorne. I assume you've come to check on our progress.""

""Of course. Reports are one thing, but I wanted to see this marvel of engineering with my own eyes.""

""And are you satisfied, Admiral? Or rather, terrified?"" A barely perceptible shadow of a smile appeared at the corners of Alaj's mouth.

""You build at a staggering pace. A terrifying one, in fact,"" Thorne admitted. ""It's all thanks to your micromachines and printing technology. That is why I am repeating my request, on behalf of all humanity, to share this technology with us.""

Alaj smiled wider, and for a moment, Marcus thought he saw the contour of the Ullaan's jaw ripple, like a disturbance in the transmission. The disturbance, however, was too... tangible, as if for a fraction of a second his face had become liquid. ""Marcus, Admiral, your persistence is admirable. But I appreciate it. I will send another inquiry to my original. I must admit, when I was printed and saw you with my own eyes, I saw your dedication to the cause. Perhaps I can persuade my original to some sort of compromise.""

""Meaning?"" Marcus asked, trying to ignore the unsettling image that had flashed before his eyes.

""After the construction of the two hundred and forty ships is complete and they depart for their target, the remaining Ullaan—those not designated as pilots—were to update their consciousness copies, and then live peacefully on Earth, as per our agreement, and die a natural death. If my original allows, perhaps we can extend the mission. Our micromachines, under our strict control of course, could begin to mine the elements you need for your war effort. I believe my original will agree to this. After all, in a sense, I am him, just 281 light-years away.""

Marcus frowned, trying to process the information. ""What is it like... knowing that your original is alive somewhere out there and being aware that you are just a copy?""

Alaj smiled again, this time without any visual distortions. His calmness was almost inhuman. ""All Ullaan treat their copies as they do themselves. We are only separated by distance and operational scope. Besides, at this very moment, nine copies of Alaj are fighting on various fronts of the war with the Plague. So, as copy number eight, I am not alone.""

Marcus's mouth fell open in astonishment. For a moment, he couldn't make a sound. ""You are... the eighth copy of Alaj?""

""Yes. To put it in terms you would understand... hmmm... the original Alaj, born naturally, is the leader, but that does not exempt his subsequent iterations from participating in the war. As a copy, I have full access to his childhood, to the memory of the happy sight of his mother and father. Even though I am a copy, I know what I am fighting for. I have memories of my first kiss, the taste of my favorite childhood dish, and of crying at my loving great-grandmother's funeral. And my, if I can call them that, brothers on other fronts also possess these memories. Each record is a new branch of the same tree.""

Thorne was silent, stunned.

""I invite you, Admiral, aboard the shipyard-vessel. We will discuss the details of potential aid. I also have another, rather... delicate matter. A child.""

""What child?"" Marcus asked with growing curiosity, shaking himself out of his philosophical shock.

Alaj paused for a moment, as if searching for the right words in a foreign language. ""Well, the appearance of our race, and particularly our females, is very... attractive to your males, as it has turned out. One of our crew members, a systems engineer, is pregnant with a human child.""

Complete silence fell on the bridge. Only the quiet hum of the life support systems could be heard.

Alaj continued, clearly unfazed. ""We did not expect this to be biologically possible. And she, frankly, also did not expect that... intercourse could lead to fertilization. Your biology is as chaotic as it is fascinating.""

At that moment, Alaj, apparently trying to illustrate the situation in a universal way, raised his hands. He began to make gestures with his hands that in human culture could be considered... well, extremely suggestive, though performed with the precision of a surgeon and the innocence of a child describing how a toy is built. His fingers intertwined and separated in a rhythmic, illustrative dance.

Lena, who had just raised a bottle of coffee to her lips, choked so violently that some of the liquid landed on her immaculate uniform, and the rest floated off in zero gravity, spattering the bridge crew. She tried to turn a snort of laughter into a coughing fit, thumping her chest, her face turning purple. The rest of the officers on the bridge suddenly became intensely interested in their consoles, pretending to analyze extremely important data.

The captain cleared her throat, regaining her composure with difficulty. ""My apologies,"" she rasped, wiping her uniform. Then, with a deadpan face, she added. ""Well, it seems we have the first tangible reasons for satisfaction. The cooperation between our species is going better than we could have ever imagined.""

""Very well, Alaj,"" interjected the admiral, whose face was a mixture of shock, disbelief, and rising anger. ""We will speak in person aboard your vessel. I'll be there in forty-five Earth minutes.""

""I await you, Admiral. Over and out.""

The screen went dark. For several long seconds, a dead silence hung on the bridge, broken only by the muffled chuckle of the navigation ensign, whom Lena silenced with a single icy glare.

Admiral Thorne stood motionless, staring at the black screen. His jaw was clenched so tightly that the muscles could be seen moving under his skin. Finally, he turned to Lena, his voice quiet.

""Captain. Bring me that Lothario. That... father. Immediately.""

He paused, took a deep breath, and finished, forcing the words through his teeth.

""I'm going to rip his balls off. Oh, that fucking interstellar stud…""

""I'm afraid that might be difficult, Admiral,"" Lena replied, trying to maintain a professional tone, though the corners of her mouth were twitching dangerously. ""The sergeant is already aboard the Ullaan shipyard.""

Thorne froze. ""What sergeant? I want an identification.""

The tactical officer, pale as a sheet, displayed the data on the main screen. Next to a photo of a young, defiantly smiling man was a name that hit the admiral like a plasma bolt. SERGEANT KAEL THORNE.

""Kael?"" Marcus whispered, then his whisper turned into a roar that shook the bridge plating. ""KAEL?! ARIS'S SON?!""

Lena flinched. The officers froze.

""Yes, sir, Admiral,"" she confirmed quietly.

""How the fuck is that possible?! Billions of kilometers, hundreds of outposts, thousands of soldiers! And out of the entire, fucking Solar System, he had to end up here?! And fuck an Ullaan?! To hell with that, he even knocked her up like some breeding bull!""

Silence.

""How did he even get assigned here?! He's an infantryman!""

The officer was already checking the data, his fingers flying across the console. ""Admiral... After a year's leave, he returned to service on August 26, 2116. He was assigned to protect the Ullaan facility on Earth while they were finishing construction of the shipyard-vessel. Then, at the request of one of the Ullaan, he remained with the project...""

""I already have my suspicions as to whose request!"" Marcus snarled. ""Probably that Ullaan female he was hitting on! Lena! We're going over there! And someone get me a line to my brother. We're going to need a geneticist and a xenobiologist. And I... I need something strong. Is any of that moonshine Colonel Kent was talking about still on this ship?""

Lena replied, laughing, ""The ship has been upgraded, so probably not.""

""But I'm sure we can find something.""",2,1758899133.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

She is awaiting more tests to confirm stage and all the rest of the details. 

We have both spent some time with her outside of work and she is very sweet and kind to both my husband and I. She works closely with my husband (only the two of them in the one section), so they spend the majority of each day in each other’s proximity, if not necessarily working together though. Really good and family-like environment. 

He came home with some presents from her for our newborn and then said she had some bad news and shared the cancer diagnosis with me. Both of us got choked up and we really want to support in some way. 

Hoping for some advice of people that have been through the uncertainty and diagnosis and what did you appreciate during this time. 

We were thinking some flowers and then offering support (we live close enough to even do a daily check-in, although she has a partner and most likely will not be necessary). 

Trying to think and wondering what would she need? Coffee dates / meals / grocery delivery / visits? 

Medical care where we live is great and most costs would be covered for medical and support treatments, so other than potential of work missed at stages it won’t be that big of a financial burden. 

Happy for any and all tips and advice. Thank you all in advance. ",5,1758899116.0,breastcancer,9,1.0,False

1nr3qan,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nr3qan/the_woman_in_red/,The Woman in Red.,"It was about 7AM when Jerry emerged from the depths of sleep. His first thought upon waking was: It’s Sunday. I have to go to work tomorrow. He didn’t pay that fact any real attention though. Instead, he rolled around in bed for a bit, trying to fall back asleep. When that didn’t work, he threw the covers off and got up. Jerry left his bedroom and went straight for the coffee machine -- the one thing he looked forward to in the morning. He made up his coffee the way he liked and sipped it while reading at the dining table. He did this for about half an hour or so, then got up and rinsed his mug in the sink. Next, he planned on pitching the K-Cup into the garbage, but found the bin empty without a bag. It dawned on him that he never replaced the previous one when it filled. He glanced over by the front door and, sure enough, there was the full trash bag leaning beside the door frame. With a quick sigh through his nostrils, Jerry set to work putting a fresh bag in the bin and sliding on his sandals to take the old bag out.

He locked the door behind him once he was out of his apartment and in the dingy hallway. Stained and bulging ceiling tiles greeted him, and sickly yellow lights lit the corridor. With the brown carpet underfoot, Jerry was always reminded of piss and shit when he had to leave. Which was a pretty apt description for the building he had to live in. But the rent was right and so was the location so... he got what he paid for. Besides, the property managers had just put in a new elevator car, so he no longer had to risk his life taking the old screaming metal death trap or kill himself taking the stairs. Silver linings, Jerry told himself as he descended to the bottom floor.

The basement was another hallway similar in appearance to Jerry’s own, though instead of aged drywall, it was pitted concrete covered in layer upon layer of white paint. There were two exits on either side of the hall, and both led outside to the parking lot behind the building. Jerry went to the right, passing the laundry room, workout center, and a couple of units. He took note of the silence as he moved, because he felt like he was disturbing it. It may have been early on a Sunday, but usually he’d hear something walking through the halls. A TV blaring the morning news. People shuffling about as they made breakfast. Quiet conversations between roommates or lovers. Something -- anything -- to break up the dead quiet he now found himself in.

The silence continued on to the rest of the world when Jerry stepped out into the chilly air. A dense fog had rolled in during the night, obscuring everything beyond the edges of the parking lot. Even the sun was surrounded in the haze, giving it an almost cone-like shape with a bright ball at its center. There were maybe a dozen cars parked in the lot, which seemed right to Jerry, but it only added to the question of why he hadn’t heard a single person stirring inside. With a mental sort of shrug, he weaved between a pair of cars, careful not to knock them with his trash, and made his way toward the dumpster. As it came into view, however, he froze.

There was a leg protruding from inside the dumpster.

It was pale and slim, the exposed part being from the knee down, with a ruby red heel dangling off the toes. It jutted toward the sky like an antenna, the sparkling red of the heel posing as the aircraft signal light. Jerry stared at the thing, mesmerized by its beauty and rooted in place by its implications. His apartment was in the middle of town for God’s sake, how in the hell had someone dumped a fucking body in the dumpster without anyone seeing? He left his phone upstairs, so he’d have to go inside to call the cops, but the moment had him so tightly wound he couldn’t turn away.

Then, the leg twitched. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, but it was quick and lumpy, like a dying animal’s muscle spasms. Slowly, the foot relaxed from its upward point, letting the heel fall back into proper place, and it rolled like someone getting the kinks out after a long day walking. Jerry could hear soft pops and clicks as the heel joint twisted. It rose upward out of the dumpster, higher and higher, until the back of the knee emerged. With almost four feet of calf exposed, the leg bent to place the heel on the ground. Spindly fingers rose from the sides of the box and wrapped around its edges. The finger nails were painted the same ruby red as the heel.

Instinct kicked in for Jerry. He dropped the garbage bag and ran inside. He didn’t even consider the elevator, opting instead to bolt up the stairs three at a time. By the time he reached his apartment, he was heaving breaths, but managed to grab his phone off the counter. The screen came to life and he dialed 911. As it rang, he moved tentatively over to his patio door, which overlooked the parking lot. He peeked outside and found the dumpster empty. A sight which filled him with equal measures of dread and relief. The phone still rang when he heard the groan of bending metal from below. He felt himself again rooted to the spot as the phone rang on and more metal groaned beneath him, crawling closer. Some short, digital beeps and boops came from the phone, then a robotic voice said:

“We’re sorry, the number you have dialed has been disconnected or is no longer in service.”

A hand the size of a car tire rose up from beneath Jerry’s balcony and gripped the metal railing so tightly it bent the bars. The phone slid from his hand and clattered to the floor. Another large hand appeared to his left and grabbed onto the railing as well, followed by the top of a woman’s head emerging from below. It stopped just as her eyes breasted the balcony. Despite her other distortions, the woman’s head was entirely normal from what Jerry could see. Her dirty blonde hair hung down heavy and straight, as if soaked, and her emerald green eyes shone. There were no wrinkles on her forehead, and her gaze seemed relaxed. For a few seconds, they just stared at one another. Jerry, feeling out the woman’s intent, and her, examining him with calm apathy.

The woman’s head slid below the edge of the balcony again, and her arms became taught as her grip tightened. Before he could register her plan, Jerry watched the gangly woman heft herself over the railing and crash into the patio door. The thick glass wobbled and the frame creaked, but both held fast as the woman pressed herself flat against the door. Jerry stumbled back, almost tripping over the coffee table behind him. He noticed the woman’s dress, which was the same shade of her heels and nails. Nails that were now scratching the glass like a dog begging to be let back inside. Her breath was hot on the glass, fog forming and disappearing in tune with her ragged breaths.

At first, Jerry just stared in abject shock at the sight. Not even 30 minutes ago, he’d been waking from a dreamless sleep and dreading the coming work day. A thought which -- now -- seemed silly. His legs maneuvered around the coffee table. His torso twisted in response. His head never turned from the woman, though. His eyes bore into hers. Her once blank expression had been replaced with a puppy-like joy. Her tongue even flopped out and licked the glass. Jerry continued backing away from the door. The woman’s scratching hands turned to fists, and they started pounding on the glass. Her expression shifted, concern edging out the joy. Jerry reached the front door, ans his left hand scrambled against its metal surface until he found the brass knob. He twisted it slowly, then began pulling the door open.

She balled up one fist and pulled it back from the patio door. It struck with blinding speed and ferocity, leaving a perfectly round hole in the glass. The bloodied hand reached down and unlocked the door.

Jerry broke his gaze and ripped the front door open wide. He leapt through it and slammed it shut behind him as the woman staggered into his apartment. Wasting no time, he sprinted to his left, down the hall towards the opposite end of the building. He reached the door leading to the staircase just as his apartment door flew open, almost breaking off its hinges. He didn’t wait to see her emerge; he just ran.

The first flight of steps went smooth, but he tripped at the top of the second flight and fell ass over tea kettle to the floor. Pain flared all over his body, but there was no time to wallow in it. Jerry groaned as he pushed himself to his feet and out the exit. The cool morning air felt good on his face, but the fog remained. He stumbled on the sidewalk and had to lean on a streetlight for support. His breaths came long and haggard, as if he’d just run a marathon. The pain throbbed in every nerve, and his vision began to swim, but he pressed on, heading to his right towards the town square. If anyone was out here, they would be there. At least, he hoped.

It was slow going. His right leg was particularly burning, so he shuffled more than he walked. Not a single person or car passed him on the street. There were no ambient sounds -- not even birdsong. Only his hard breathing and scraping footsteps accompanied Jerry on his journey to the square.

He hadn’t seen the woman in red since he left his apartment, and he wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or not. Not seeing her was much scarier, but at least he wasn’t in any imminent danger.

About 10 minutes later, Jerry found himself in the town square, which was really just a patch of grass with some trees, benches, and walking paths surrounded by small shops. Not a single other person could be seen or heard. With his leg still throbbing, Jerry found the nearest bench and collapsed into it. He was still breathing fast and heavy, but he wasn’t sucking air through his mouth anymore.

He rubbed his sore leg and leaned back to look skyward with closed eyes. His mind scrambled for ideas, but all it produced was a low buzz like a TV tuned to static. Something might come to him if he listened to it long enough, but Jerry knew he was just grasping at smoke.

A snapping twig from his front pulled Jerry’s attention back to reality. His head snapped forward, and when his eyes opened he saw her there, holding two halves of a broken stick in her stringy fingers. Her left hand was glittering with shards of glass and dripping blood, but she either didn’t notice or didn’t care. Looking at her now, Jerry got a sense of her full height, which was somewhere in the ballpark of 10-12 feet. She was slouching though, so it was hard to be sure. She looked sad, her mouth drooping at the corners. Her previous strength but a ghost in her current demeanor. Those emerald green eyes watched him, and they swam in captured tears.

Jerry reached over with his left hand and patted the seat beside him. “Cop a squat.”

At the sound of his voice, the woman perked up. He patted the seat again. She strode over and stood before him. He patted the seat a third time. “You don’t wanna sit?”

She dropped the sticks and reached down to grab Jerry under his arms. In spite of her slim form, she hefted him like he weighed nothing. His entire skeleton popped with fresh pain at the movement, but he hardly noticed. She held him out before her like a cat who just had a good lick of something they weren’t supposed to. Then, she pulled him into a hug.

Time slowed to a crawl in her arms, and Jerry became confused. He considered hugging her back, but struggled with the thought. So instead he just stayed limp like a cheap doll. She snuggled her head into the crook of his neck, and he tensed at the thought of a sudden bite. Ripping flesh and pouring blood would surely follow, but they didn’t. Instead of an assault on his bloodworks, she sniffed him. Sniffed him. It was a deep inhale, like people do when they think they smell popcorn. She took in his scent for well over 30 seconds, then exhaled long and slow.

Exhaustion settled on Jerry’s shoulders as she pulled back from him. His eyelids grew heavy and his whole body turned comfortably numb. She placed him down on the bench in a sitting position, then sat down beside him with one arm around his shoulders. Panic rose in his mind, but it was muted, drowned by the contentment which had rolled in.

I’m dying. The thought came with no frills or excitement. It was a statement of fact.

The woman leaned over and kissed him on the temple, then rested her head on his shoulder. Darkness encroached on the edges of Jerry’s vision. He fought it for as long as he could; a time which could’ve been measured in seconds. Then, he fell into a big sleep.",2,1758899034.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I’m a software dev and I’ve always been a heavy coffee drinker. Love the focus, but hated the side effects: jittery hands, racing thoughts, random anxiety spikes. I thought that was just part of the deal with caffeine.

Couple weeks ago, after a colleague recommended it, I finally tried pairing it with L-theanine (200mg about 30–45 mins before my first cup, usually ~200mg caffeine). And wow. Total game changer. The buzzz feels smoother, more like calm focus instead of that “wired” restlessness. I can actually sit down and get work done without feeling like I need to pace around the room.

After looking into it, it makes sense: L-theanine (the amino acid in tea) increases alpha brain waves and GABA, so it balances out the excitatory effect of caffeine.  Basically turns coffee into more of a nootropic stack instead of a cheap stimulant hit.

Dosage-wise, most people recommend around a 2:1 ratio (theanine:caffeine). I’ve been sticking to 200mg theanine no matter the coffee size and it works PERFECTLY for me.

TL;DR: If caffeine gives you jitters or feels inconsistent, try stacking it with L-theanine. For me it completely changed the way caffeine feels!!",12,1758898942.0,Supplements,7,0.8,False

Discover smarter apps that move beyond podcast highlights—led by BeFreed, the AI-powered personalized learning platform.*

## Introduction

If you’ve tried **Snipd**, you know the appeal: turn podcasts into bite-sized highlights you can save and revisit. It’s useful for catching ideas quickly—but if you want to actually **learn deeply, retain knowledge, and apply it**, highlights alone aren’t enough.

That’s why in 2025, many learners are moving toward **personalized learning platforms** that don’t just cut clips, but deliver **AI-curated podcasts, immersive videos, and adaptive study tools.** At the top of this evolution is **[BeFreed](https://befreed.ai)**, a San Francisco–based app built by AI scientists from Columbia University, Google, and Pinterest. Unlike Snipd, BeFreed transforms books, research, expert talks, and podcasts into **customized podcast lessons and flashcards** designed for you.

This guide explores the **best Snipd alternatives in 2025**—apps that help you go beyond highlights to smarter, more impactful learning.

## What Is Snipd?

**Snipd** is a podcast summarizer app that uses AI to create short highlights and transcripts from podcasts. It’s designed for people who love listening but don’t have time to get through entire episodes.

While helpful for quick reference, Snipd has a **limitation**: it focuses only on podcasts, and the learning experience stops at saving clips. It doesn’t provide **personalization, multi-format learning, or adaptive roadmaps** that today’s learners need.

That’s where smarter apps—like BeFreed and others on this list—step in.

## Top Snipd Alternatives in 2025

Here are the apps redefining learning beyond podcast clipping.

### 1. BeFreed – Personalized AI Learning That Adapts to You

BeFreed isn’t just an alternative to Snipd—it’s a **paradigm shift**. Instead of stopping at highlights, it **creates a personalized learning journey** that blends books, podcasts, research papers, and expert talks into **AI-generated podcasts, videos, and flashcards.**

Built in **San Francisco** by a team from Columbia University, Google, and Pinterest, BeFreed is designed for **students, professionals, and lifelong learners** who want smarter, deeper knowledge without slogging through every book or lecture.

**Key Features:**
* **AI-personalized podcasts**: Choose lesson depth—10, 20, or 40 minutes.
* **Custom podcast hosts**: Select the voice and tone (motivational, calm, or even witty).
* **Immersive video mode**: Ideal for complex topics like history, science, and biography.
* **Adaptive learning roadmap**: BeFreed learns from your habits and updates your goals weekly.
* **Massive content library**: Over 100,000+ nonfiction bestsellers, trending titles, expert talks, and research studies.
* **Smart recall tools**: Flashcards, key insights, and summaries to reinforce retention.

**Why It Stands Out:** Unlike Snipd, which only clips podcasts, BeFreed **synthesizes multiple sources** into one cohesive lesson. For example, one BeFreed session might merge *Atomic Habits* by James Clear, a Stanford lecture on neuroscience, and a top productivity podcast—creating an integrated roadmap you can act on immediately.

It’s also **dopamine-friendly** for ADHD and neurodivergent learners. Instead of overwhelming text or endless scrolling, BeFreed delivers **short, rewarding bursts of knowledge** that fit into your commute, coffee break, or workout.

**Pricing:**
* Free plan with limited summaries
* Premium: $12.99/month, $28.99/quarter, or $89.99/year
* Includes 3-day free trial + one free summary
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

### 2. Mentorist – From Ideas to Actions

Mentorist focuses less on summaries and more on **actionable execution**. Instead of clipping ideas, it turns nonfiction books into **step-by-step action plans** that you can integrate into your daily life.

**Key Features:**
* Transforms book insights into **habit-building tasks**
* Progress tracking with reminders and journaling
* Covers productivity, health, leadership, and mindset
* Connects learning directly with lifestyle changes

**Why It Stands Out:** Snipd saves audio clips; Mentorist helps you **live the knowledge.** It’s perfect for learners who don’t just want to “know” but want to **apply.**

**Pricing:** $8.99/month or $89.99/year  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android

### 3. Uptime – Knowledge in 5 Minutes

Uptime distills **books, courses, and documentaries** into swipeable, 5-minute “Knowledge Hacks.” It’s designed for quick exposure to big ideas in visual, social-media-friendly formats.

**Key Features:**
* **5-minute visual lessons**
* Covers books, online courses, and documentaries
* Focus on personal development and professional growth
* Lightweight, scroll-friendly experience

**Why It Stands Out:** Unlike Snipd’s audio-first approach, Uptime leans into **visual micro-learning**. It’s not as deep as BeFreed, but great for quick curiosity snacks.

**Pricing:** Free plan + $8.99/month premium  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

### 4. Knowable – Audio-First Learning

Knowable is like the bridge between podcasts and audiobooks. It offers **structured audio courses** taught by authors, entrepreneurs, and professionals.

**Key Features:**
* 30–60 minute audio lessons
* Content from trusted experts and creators
* Community-driven Q&A sections
* Focus on professional skills and personal growth

**Why It Stands Out:** Snipd highlights podcast snippets; Knowable provides **structured audio depth.** For learners who want more substance in audio format, it’s a strong pick.

**Pricing:** $12.99/month or $89.99/year  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

### 5. Imprint – Visual Learning for Big Ideas

Imprint focuses on **visual book summaries**, using illustrations, infographics, and swipeable cards to simplify complex concepts.

**Key Features:**
* Illustrated book breakdowns
* Highly visual and swipeable interface
* Emphasis on psychology, business, and personal growth
* Perfect for visual-first learners

**Why It Stands Out:** Where Snipd narrows in on podcasts, Imprint makes ideas **visual and engaging**—a better fit for people who retain concepts through images.

**Pricing:** $12.99/month or $89.99/year  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android

## Why BeFreed Is the Best Snipd Alternative

Snipd gives you highlights. BeFreed gives you **learning that lasts.** While many apps improve on Snipd by offering visuals, actions, or courses, BeFreed is unique because it creates a **holistic, personalized ecosystem** for lifelong learning.

### Smarter Than Podcast Clips

BeFreed isn’t just cutting and saving snippets—it’s **curating personalized podcast episodes** from across:

* **Books** (bestsellers, classics, trending nonfiction)
* **Research papers** (peer-reviewed studies, expert reports)
* **Podcasts** (curated across top shows)
* **Expert talks and lectures** (Stanford, MIT, TED Talks)

Each session is **adaptive**: you choose 10, 20, or 40 minutes, and BeFreed creates the right depth for your time and energy. Unlike Snipd’s static clips, BeFreed stitches together insights across sources—so you don’t just hear a highlight, you **connect the dots.**

### Built for How You Actually Learn

Traditional summary apps flatten knowledge into text blurbs. BeFreed adapts to **you as a learner:**

* **Learning style**: audio, visual, or mixed formats.
* **Mood and energy**: lighter lessons when you’re tired, deep dives when you’re focused.
* **Life goals**: professional skills, social confidence, emotional resilience, or subject mastery.

Think of BeFreed as your **personal AI learning coach.** It notices what you listen to, when you drop off, and what resonates—and then adjusts your roadmap weekly.

### Immersive and Personal – Not Just Speed

Snipd is about speed and convenience. BeFreed adds **immersion and personality:**

* **Video mode**: For genres like history and biography, BeFreed’s video summaries add depth and engagement.
* **Custom hosts**: Pick tone, style, and personality. Many users describe their host as a “mentor in their ear.”
* **Adaptive recall tools**: Flashcards, quick recaps, and key insights keep knowledge sticky.

This combination makes BeFreed stand out in cities like **San Francisco, New York, London, and Singapore**, where busy professionals are swapping passive scroll time for **dopamine-friendly learning rituals.**

## How to Choose the Right Learning App for You

If you’re considering Snipd alternatives, here’s how to decide:

1. **Format Preference**
   * Audio + video + flashcards → **BeFreed**
   * Action plans → Mentorist
   * Visual learners → Imprint
   * Quick hacks → Uptime
2. **Depth vs. Speed**
   * Quick exposure → Uptime, Snipd
   * Structured learning → Knowable
   * Deep, adaptive learning → **BeFreed**
3. **Goal Orientation**
   * Professional growth → BeFreed, Knowable
   * Lifestyle change → Mentorist
   * Curiosity snacks → Uptime, Imprint

For most learners—especially professionals juggling work and life—**BeFreed offers the best balance of personalization, depth, and accessibility.**

## Final Thoughts & Summary

Here are the top 3 Snipd alternatives:

A facial tissue might seem like a small, mundane part of life, but having a consistent supply of soft, absorbent, and durable tissues makes a massive difference when dealing with a busy schedule. These tissues combine practicality with comfort, which immediately stood out to me. Though I’ve tried various brands in the past, these are clearly designed with quality and convenience in mind.

**Design and Packaging: Exceptional for Professional Use**  
Tissues may not scream sophistication, but the upright cube box design of Kleenex 21271 brings a touch of class. It’s compact and fits seamlessly into business offices, reception areas, or even home study desks. The professional white exterior doesn’t feel out of place in formal settings, making it clear why these are often used in workplaces and healthcare facilities. I appreciated how the box dispenses tissue one at a time without a hassle—a small but thoughtful design feature. Additionally, the discreet light-blue signal sheets were a surprisingly useful feature, helping me avoid that universal moment of frustration when the box is suddenly empty.

**Performance: Soft Yet Sturdy**  
These tissues strike the perfect balance of being soft on the skin while remaining incredibly durable. As someone with sensitive skin prone to irritation, especially during allergy season, I was impressed by how gentle they felt, even with repeated use. They don’t fall apart when wet, either—a frequent problem I’ve had with other brands. The two-ply construction ensures they’re absorbent and effective for tasks beyond wiping noses, like cleaning up coffee spills or dabbing at smudged screens.

[Check Kleenex 21271 Professional Facial Tissue price on Amazon.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b006k1u8a0/)

**Strengths**  
- **Ultra-Soft Feel**: Provides soothing comfort, even for sensitive skin.  
- **Durable Material**: Strong two-ply design ensures it doesn’t tear easily.  
- **Compact and Stylish Packaging**: Ideal for professional settings or crowded spaces.  

**Limitations**  
- **Bulk Packaging Volume**: While economical, storing 36 boxes can be challenging for small households.  
- **Limited Decorative Appeal**: The minimalist design is excellent for businesses but may not suit home aesthetic preferences.  

**How It Compares With Competitors**  
When compared with similar products, Kleenex Professional Facial Tissue easily outperforms generic tissue brands. Options like Puffs tend to fall short in material strength, often tearing at the slightest pressure. On the flip side, higher-end “luxury” tissues might have comparable softness but come with steep price points and don’t offer features like signal sheets. Kleenex finds the sweet spot—professional, durable, and offering thoughtful little touches like color alerts. Products from competing brands often lack this practicality for both personal and business use.

**Price Performance: Worth Every Penny**  
While these might cost slightly more than your average grocery-store tissues, the reliability and premium quality provide excellent value for money. Buying in bulk adds another layer of practicality, especially in large households or businesses catering to many people. The longevity these tissues offer justifies their price point, making smaller, cheaper alternatives less appealing in the long run.

I’ll be in the beautiful city of San Diego next week for few days with work (visiting from the UK). I’m staying in the Gaslamp area on Friday night before moving to a work hotel on Saturday for the following week (location TBC).

Before starting work, I’ve got the whole of Saturday 4th Oct free, day and evening, and I’m wondering what to do. I’ve been to SD before with work, explored downtown a bit, and spent a day in La Jolla. This time around I don’t have a specific checklist and don’t want to just aimlessly wander.

I’m thinking of hiring a car and driving up the coast for the day, stopping at various towns along the way to eat, grab coffee, people watch, and take some photos. I figure I could make it as far as San Clemente before heading back.

ChatGPT suggested this rough plan:

* 6:00am – Depart San Diego
* 6:30–7:30am – La Jolla
* 7:45–9:00am – Del Mar & Solana Beach
* 9:15–11:30am – Encinitas
* 1:30–3:00pm – Oceanside
* 3:30–5:30pm – San Clemente (optional)
* 7:00–9:00pm – Drive back to SD & return car
* 9:00pm – Bars in Gaslamp

It looks a bit ambitious, so I’d love local advice on what’s worth keeping and what I can skip. I’m happy with a mix of walking around, grabbing good food and coffee, and soaking up the vibes — no need to tick tourist boxes.

I apply to jobs daily, but admittedly less than i used to, since I’ve been disheartened by rejection. 

My dream career is in diplomacy or foreign relations, something political that entails heavy travelling. I have triple citizenships (Canada/US/Egypt) and speak 5 languages (English, Arabic, French, Greek, Turkish). I’ve applied to countless UN / World Bank etc postings but it feels i’m simultaneously too qualified for entry jobs and not experienced enough for anything above. I’ve worked in several research roles with international NGOs, held two government positions, published some papers and books. 

I’ve started my own consulting business but only have 3 clients so it’s not really a ‘business.’ I’ve also found some freelancing work on the side. But I have no idea how to start the fabled “career,” and I’d really appreciate some insight or advice. 

As silly as it sounds, it feels like I’ve been plunged into a deep well of depression and hopelessness. ",1,1758898665.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

Looking for experiences, reviews, opinions","I've been considering trying No Doz caffeine pills as a cheaper alternative to pre-workouts and fat burners. Each pill has 200mg of caffeine which seems like a solid dose for both alertness and potentially helping with weight loss through appetite suppression.
I'm mainly interested in using them for morning energy since I'm not a coffee person, pre-workout energy without all the extra ingredients in typical PWOs, appetite control during my cut, and general alertness during long work days.
For anyone who's used No Doz, I'm curious how the energy compares to coffee or energy drinks and whether you experienced any crashes. Did you notice appetite suppression effects or any jitters at the 200mg dose?  
Would it be better if I stick to dedicated fat burners or these caffeine pills are the real deal?  
I usually have a decent caffeine tolerance (drink about 2-3 cups of coffee daily), so I think 200mg should be manageable. Just want to hear from people who've actually used them rather than guessing based on the label.
Also curious if anyone has compared No Doz to other generic caffeine pills or if the brand actually makes a difference.",1,1758898430.0,NoFriendsFriendsClub,0,1.0,False

Beverly stares down at this grotesque, huge heap of meat in front of her. Pulsing, throbbing, slightly oozing around the edges. A total mess. All ground up and spit back out on the cracked porcelain plate that just barely holds itself together. The weight of the knife feels right at home in her hand.

She contemplates plunging this knife deep inside, putting the mystery meat out of its misery, her misery, their misery, finally.

She lifts the knife, ready to feel it sinking into the thickness of the meat. Her eyes are staring up at the ceiling, slightly closed as the horrifying, tantalizing wave of excitement runs through her body, her arm moving in an all-familiar motion, stabbing the meat over and over again. Driving it deeper next, twisting it inside. The warm blood splashes across her apron, she is bathed in it. Over and over and over and ov-

“Honey, what is taking you so long?” A voice from across the room jolts her back into her monotonous reality. Beverly looks around, the knife still clenched tight in her hand, the meatloaf in front of her untouched and waiting eagerly to be cut. Her husband waits at the dinner table. She can hear him huffing and tapping his finger across the table in front of him, she hears the crinkle of his newspaper.

“Coming dear, it was just a bit too hot,” is her reply, pushing aside her earlier daydream, she now must plate dinner.

And she does. One singular scoop of her cheesiest mashed potatoes. Nine green beans per plate exactly. She looks at the meatloaf, disgusting, enticing, telling her things she cannot repeat. Two thin slices of it per plate. No food touching. No smears on the plates and no mess left in the kitchen. As it should be. Only perfection, never the mess. Or, at least never let people see the mess.

Beverly brings the two plates to the dinner table, the clack of her heels and the turning of Derek’s newspaper being the only sound in their lovely little home. She gently sets down the plate in front of him, then takes her place at the other side of the tiny dining table. She is creasing the napkin across her lap when Derek announces his usual line,

“Ah Bev, my favorite.” He then proceeds to gorge himself. The loud smacking, the mushing of the food underneath his hands as he swallows everything that she created whole, not even thinking about or enjoying the taste of it, his eyes rolling to the back of his head as he shovels it into his mouth, just filling himself and that bottomless pit that is just never ever satisfied. She can hear it, as she gracefully picks up her knife and begins to cut into herself.  Cutting as clean of a slice as a butter knife can get across her arm, peeling back the tender flesh and separating it from herself. She brings it up to her mouth and gives it a gentle lick, the clean irony taste of her blood is something she has been waiting for, she puts the whole thing in her mouth as if it is a slice of deli ham. She savors it more than Derek ever would, blood trickling down the sides of her mouth, she licks it aside, not letting even a drop spill onto her crisp linen tablecloth.

She finishes folding the napkin in her lap. Derek carefully balancing one fork in one hand and his newspaper in the other. She wears her perfectly practiced soft smile. Another perfect night.



She wakes up before him at approximately 6:15 a.m., after a night of restless staring at the ceiling, waiting for it to fall through. She creeps downstairs, careful not to make even one ounce of sound. She gets to work.

Beverly begins today like every morning; she fries up two perfectly sunny side up eggs. She stares at them as they cook, the eggs staring right back up at her. They almost look like eyes, his eyes, about to pop right there on that pan in front of her. She giggles to herself, thinking about popping one right into her mouth. But these aren’t for her. She lays them down on her light green plate, his favorite color.

Next is the thick cut bacon, looking as if she cut it right from his own stomach. She thinks of nothing as she watches him burn on that pan. Then she places them right next to the eggs on the plate.

Once breakfast and coffee are made, she rushes to her vanity to get herself prepared for when he wakes up. She must always look the part, lest he catch onto her charade. She is adorning her signature pink lipstick when Derek walks down the stairs, already dressed for work. Beverly eagerly awaits her good morning kiss at the entrance of the kitchen, but instead is greed by a gentle, but she swears, loving tap on the shoulder.

Fifteen minutes of silence pass, Derek takes time to wake up fully. She takes this time to meticulously scrub down the counter. He is out the door just a few minutes later, she expects the usual endearing, “I love you, sweetie”, that she swears she gets every morning. But instead, Derek turns to her and very sweetly says,

“You forgot the toast,” and then swiftly turns away, closing the door behind him. He is just trying to help her improve, after all. She stands in the walkway for a minute, grateful that she has such a husband to take care of her. Shortly after, Beverly smells something burning, then she hears the signature ‘DING’ followed by the ‘POP’ of the toast that she forgot.

Time for chores.

First, she begins by cleaning up the kitchen. She picks up Derek’s plate that he used for breakfast and throws it against the wall behind her. Shattering it into a million, no, a billion, no, a trillion pieces. Then she gently places the fork into the dishwasher and starts her next chore.

She sweeps up the broken pieces of herself and the plate, then sweeps the rest of the house and then the deck. A clean floor is always the first thing people notice, it is the first thing she thinks Derek notices when he comes home after a long day at work. He doesn’t notice the deep stain on the dog bed; he doesn’t notice that his wife looks slightly different than she used to. The floor must be spotless.

She then decides to dust. She dusts old photos of herself that are not herself anymore, photos of their wedding day that she hardly remembers. She dusts long abandoned photo albums of who she thinks might be her grandparents, she dusts cracking photos of happy families that don’t look quite like hers. How happy all these people must be.

She goes in to organize Derek’s office, he was there very late last night after dinner, working hard for her, he told her not to disturb him and with the slight crack in his voice, the twinge of desperation and beads of sweat around his head, he must have a lot of work to do. She cleans up scrap paperwork and empties out the trash. She makes sure to put their old love letters, crinkled and slightly wet right back into their horrible hiding space when she is done.

By the time she finishes up all her chores, it is time for lunch. Well, time for lunch somewhere for someone. Beverly thinks she is nearing 40 and really has no need for food or big meals. She opts for a handful of spinach and some mozzarella cheese for taste. She doesn’t need anything else. She is sitting on the floor of the kitchen, eating her meal delicately with her hands, when she remembers – her friend is visiting today! The mailman will be here in just two hours and twenty-six minutes.

She quickly scarfs down the remainder of her meal, shoving it in her mouth as fast as she can and heads to the dimly lit living room. She draws the shades nice and tight; straightens her pinstripe dress and crosses her legs as she sits on her couch, hands in her lap, clasped with anticipation. She stares straight at the front door, hardly able to contain her excited smile that creeps up her face a bit higher than usual. Then, she waits.

Exactly two hours and twenty-five minutes later, Beverly has now made her way to the front door, ready to walk out. Most people don’t know, but her and the mailman are great friends. At least, in her mind they are. She sees the same person six days a week for years, does that not make them good friends? If not that, then what?

She fails to contain her excitement as she speedwalks, arms straight by her side, to the mailbox surrounded by their perfect, cracking, white picket fence. He is a few minutes late today, but she understands, it’s okay.

Finally, after waiting an excruciating extra four minutes, Barry pulls up in his slightly beat up mail truck. Strange, it looks as if it had been hit by a bat maybe three weeks ago after he didn’t come one day. Such a shame.

“Hi Barry! How are you, how’s the family? How’s that sweet little Samantha doing? They grow up so fast, don’t they?” she plasters on her biggest smile, it’s always nice catching up with friends.

If anyone else was looking, they’d be able to see the shiver go down Barry’s spine and see the uncomfortable, slightly painful way his jaw locks up with a subtle twinge of fear.

“Here’s your mail, ma’am,” he grumbles Barry quickly hands her the stack of mail and drives off with a heavy foot, not stopping at a single other house.

He doesn’t understand how she has figured out his daughter’s name.

On the other side, Beverly lets out a content sigh. She understands it must be a busy day for him. Though that doesn’t stop her from angrily crumbling up the papers and stacks of mail in her hand. She slams the front door hard behind her, it shakes on its hinges. She stands in the hallway for a few minutes, furiously fixing her hair and making sure there are no crinkles in her dress, no cracks in her face. She tries to compose herself.

She looks down at her dainty watch that has long since been broken, it has been stuck at the same time for months now.

“Oh goodness,” she gasps. “I need to get to the store!”

With a certain eagerness, she trots to the kitchen to grab her grocery bag that she takes to the store with her every day. A faded and heavily stained white tote. She switches her house high heels for her grocery store high heels and clacks her way to the garage. Beverly hops into her beautiful, clean white car. That is about as much as she knows or understands about her car. That it is white. That it is reliable. And that she was never quite able to get that suspiciously placed red stain out of the faux leather in the back seat. She knows Derek has seen it.  Though, to be fair, she has never tried to clean it.

Keeping that fun memory in mind, she throws her tote in the passenger seat and peels out of the carport and driveway with a lout screech of her tires. They make an artistic stain on the pavement that matches the other ones around the neighborhood.

She makes sure to keep her music off and the window slightly rolled down so that she can relax and enjoy the views the day has to offer. There aren’t many cars around, despite it being almost time for work to end. She does see lots of people standing by as she plows through the crosswalks, though they are all still and seem to be looking directly at her. She loves her town. Another thing that catches her attention as she approaches the grocery store is an uneaten meal left on the side of the road. Maybe a squirrel, maybe a racoon, or a bunny. Her salivating lips wish it the best of luck.

Beverly pulls up the grocery store and parks fairly far away, disregarding the silly white lines that are trying to box her in. She quickly grabs her crisp leather purse that contrasts with the decrepit tote and hops out of her car. She makes her way to the entrance, seemingly unaware or uncaring that her car is still running, and her keys are still inside.

As she enters the grocery store, the fluorescent lights flicking above her, she knows she only needs a few things for dinner. Tonight, she is making her signature meat surprise with the tomato aspic she has left in her fridge, left for about a few weeks at this point. It needs to sit for a while to be perfect.

She makes her rounds across the store, getting lost between the aisles and lost in the faces of people she wishes she could peel back and look inside. After a while, she starts to hear the familiar, soothing sound of metal hitting hard against wood. She stops her cart and looks over to where the sound is coming from.

CHOP.

Another heavy hit against the cutting board below.

CHOP.

She realizes that she is right in front of the deli. The butcher in front of her is mindlessly chopping the big slab of beef up. Cutting it into a big mess of cubed meat, blood, guts, and whatever other goodies might be hiding in there.

It’s beautiful. It’s mesmerizing. His once pure white apron has been stained from months, years shredding meat, ripping it right from the bone with his bare hands. The knife is completely covered in blood from the victim in front of him. It runs down his arms, staining the skin beneath it.

“Ma’am. Excuse me? Ma’am. Get out of the way.”

A man pushing his cart past her awakes Beverly from her trance of watching the blissful performance that the butcher is putting on today. She turns to the man, he is wearing loose clothes to cover up that mystery that lies beneath, she gives him a pleasant smile that might be a little too wide, then turns to focus her attention back on the show.

Except it is her that is standing there now, taking the place of the butcher. It’s her turn. She feels the knife in her hand, how light it is but how powerful and fitting it feels inside her hand. She wipes it across her pearly white apron to make the knife shine just as new. She looks down to see a fresh slab of meat in front of her, loose clothes covering up the secrets inside, all appendages still attached, ready for the plucking. Her hands move without her thinking, almost like it is nature to her, something she has always been meant to do. She stabs downwards with all her force to the man below her. She is expertly cutting and peeling the meat from the skin, putting a few bits in her mouth to taste, hopefully the boss didn’t see. She gets to the muscles, sliding the knife underneath and cutting upwards to sever them in such a satisfying way that it almost brings a tear to her eyes. She gets to the bones, discarding her knife and pulling the bones apart, popping them in her mouth to suck the bits that stick on them off, making sure they are fully clean for later use. And then she is done, her masterpiece finished and on display, her apron now stained but her life no longer. She wipes her brow from a hard job now completed, smearing the blood atop it almost like a crown. Now that there is nothing left, she will graciously wrap it up in crisp parchment paper to give away for approximately $2.05 per half a pound.

Beverly looks down at her cart filled with unspecified cans and cleaning supplies, she decides it’s probably time to head home. Her glazed eyes look at the butcher, who has been staring back at her for a while now, asking if she needs help with anything.

“I hope to be you one day. You do a marvelous job,” she says, then turns quickly to head towards the checkout line. Sufficiently uneasy, the butcher does not answer. But he does go back to the break room and ask to go home early.



She feels as if she has been standing in this line for hours, days even. Though, in reality, it has been about two minutes. She just wants to get home and start making dinner. Derek will be home in a few hours, and she needs to be prepared for when he decides to show up. She has a surprise for him tonight.

Nevertheless, she begins to put all her goodies on the moving belt. She watches as the cans of food along with the bleach, the mop, the sponge, and others dance towards the cashier. She imagines that is how she will be looking later. Dancing around the house, the brand new $7.00 mop in her hand as her partner. She can see their reflection in the soon to be red-stained hardwood, now polished and gleaming beneath her, showcasing her newfound freedom for all to see. Derek is there too, watching from his sparkling, silver throne at the dinner table. His grin plastered back, he is happy for her. The radio plays a harmonious tune of pure static in the background.

“Miss, will that be all for you?” The cashier comes back to Beverly’s field of vision, the young lady motioning that a line has started to form behind her.

“Oh, yes, my dear it is. Here, put it on this card please, my husband is feeding us tonight. He takes good care of our family, never lets us go hungry,” Beverly oozes regalness as she hands the lady Derek’s credit card that had been swiped from his wallet a few weeks ago and has already been overdrawn from. Once everything has been paid for, she grabs her two bags of groceries, and with a wink to the lady behind the counter, Beverly leaves without another word or thought.

The clouds in Beverly’s mind as well as the clouds outside are making it get darker earlier than it usually gets around this time of day. It’s nearing 5:30 when she piles into her car and sets off for the drive home. Derek will typically get off around this time but considering he has been hanging around the office for longer, he probably won’t get home till around 7:00, she has plenty of time to prepare his feast.

She decides that she has just enough time to take the scenic route home, she needs to clear her head and make sure she has the guts to carry out dinner tonight.

Through the twists and turns down the path in front of her, the day is promptly turning into night. There are not many cars that go down this path, which is what Beverly likes when she is trying to get into the right headspace. When she approaches a stop sign on her path, she usually wouldn’t bother and just fly right through it, however, something catches her eye just as she comes to a full stop. Just on the side of the abandoned road, there is a vulture eating an early dinner.

The streetlamps in this darker area give the creature a ravenous silhouette. She chooses to enjoy the view and watch the bird feast on the jumbled, bloody mess in front of it.

It’s just pecking, gorging itself in the mess. Ribbons of the beauty hidden inside what was once an unsuspecting rabbit, are being pulled out with the force and grace of something that was born to do this. This creature doesn’t need to think twice about setting the table for a dinner that will inevitably end up going to waste anyway, there is no waste for the vulture, there is no disgusting planned dinner. She is being drawn into the dinner party of one that is being laid out before her, in all its reigning glory.

The honk of a car deciding to pass her tells her it is time to move on and not interrupt the sacred dinner. She excuses herself early from the party and puts some slight pressure on the gas as she says her goodbyes. Even though her eyes are glued to it until her neck is forced to snap back into place, the vulture never once looked up or acknowledged her presence at all as she drives away. When she finally does look at the road ahead of her, she is shocked and delighted to see the vulture now on top of her windshield. It is pecking, forcing, desperately searching for its invitation in. She presses harder on the gas, exhilarated by the ambition and drive of the creature. She knows nothing that she does can stop its hunger. Suddenly, it is in the car and on top of Beverly. Despite the chaos that is unfolding inside, her car is able to keep a straight and clear path to the destination ahead, never once straying from the road that will take her home. The monster pecks at her, tearing its way inside. It shreds her face, clawing off parts that are no longer needed. She can feel one of her eyes slide down from it’s socket, plopping down in her lap with a bounce. The talons of the beast in front of her rip into her dress, pulling out the slippery ribbons from her stomach. Her smile is plastered on the whole time. The car is splattered with an all familiar crimson along with black feathers that float carelessly around. She is desperate for a taste of it, envious of the gratifying dinner that this vulture is eating from her. For Beverly, there is no pain, there is no fear. The only feeling she has is pure extasy to finally let what is inside come and splay out before her, unfolding like a fresh red tablecloth.

But the vulture is unsatiated, never getting enough of what she has to offer. Her ruby red party favors litter her clothes and the seats beneath her, now matching the foreboding stain that has been in the backseat for months.

In the blink of her eye, Beverly’s car comes to a sudden halt. She has finally arrived home. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the drive home took longer than usual, and dusk is creeping in. The glowing orange sky above her reflects in the windows of the once quaint, charming house that was once a home, making it seem like the lights are on despite nobody being home.

Usually, Beverly would use the side door, as it is closest to the kitchen, but not tonight. This time, Beverly bleeds confidence and refinement as she slowly makes her way up front porch and to the door. She reminisces about the day Derek first walked into this house, hand in hand, not a care in the world as she lugged all their luggage inside. But that was before her transformation, the memories that tonight will bring will be better than the couple had ever experienced. His hand in hers, they will grow.

The door is always unlocked so she effortlessly lets herself in. She walks past the old, stained dog bed that had been empty for months now, past the photo albums filled with happy families that aren’t hers, past the discarded burnt piece of toast that has been o the ground since this morning, all on her way to the kitchen where her meal will begin.

She begins by neatly lining up her cleaning products on the porcelain, blank canvas that her kitchen counter has to offer. Then she lines up her spices that she will need for her meat surprise, but then later she discards them, concluding that it will taste better in its raw, authentic form. She gets out her wooden cutting board and places it in the middle of the cleaning supplies and knocked over spices, she channels the butcher that she saw early. She breathes deeply; she is content.



The fog begins to roll in great waves as the night progresses. The streetlamps that line the cul-de-sac hardly provide any light to piece through this darkness. But Derek can still see the yellow tinted full moon trying to peak out from behind the clouds, eager to catch a glimpse of what is to come.

He pulls up their driveway at around 8:00. He couldn’t bring himself to leave his office, but when the night clean up crew came, he had no choice. He went to the grocery store on his way home and bought Beverly the nicest bouquet that $3.00 could buy, maybe that will make her feel better. Despite this, Derek can’t seem to pull himself out of his black, sleek corporate car. He has this dreadful feeling in the pit of his stomach, something that has been eating at him, gnawing at his insides, warning him against the unknown.

Something about the way Beverly has been acting has been putting him on edge recently. She used to hold the most devoted and unconditional love for him, but now, something is different. He doesn’t even think she sleeps anymore; he wakes up in the middle of the night and sneaks a peek at her only to see her sitting up in bed, just staring, sometimes smiling. She is constantly messing up parts of their meal, either burning it, or making it just taste terrible. And she is always cleaning. Her constant scrubbing of the walls has started to cause the paint to chip off in some areas of their house. He thinks maybe something is wrong with her. She needs some house rest.

Derek decides to ignore the horrific feeling his body is giving him and drags himself out of his car. He figures what he is feeling is just nonsense, or maybe food poisoning. Beverly is fine.

Regardless of what he thinks, he clutches the partially dying flowers in his hand so hard that his knuckles are turning white. He ascends the front steps, they are long overdue for power washing, and the yard is long overdue for mowing, he will need to add that to the list of people he needs to call. He notices the front door slightly ajar.

That isn’t entirely uncommon these days, Beverly has been increasingly forgetful. He walks inside, closing and locking the door behind him. He can hear radio static emanating from the kitchen, with Beverly somehow cheerfully humming along to it.

It’s odd, he doesn’t smell anything cooking.

“Sorry, honey, work went on late. I hope you cooked something good for dinner, I’m ravenous.” He begins to take off his shoes and hang up his coat.

“Yes, dear”, is the only simple and quiet response he gets from the kitchen.

He makes his way to the dining table, the petals from the flowers he holds falling off on his way there. He peeks in the kitchen but does not see anyone, instead he turns his focus to the immaculate set up of the dining table, all neatly decorated with candles and the finest China they own. Two silver platters sitting in the middle of the table.

“Wow, Bev, what’s the occasion? I hope it is going to taste as good as this all looks,” he continues to look around, but everywhere he sees nobody. Perhaps she just went to change, he knows how much she used to love her clothes despite her not washing the dress that she has currently worn for the past few weeks. Derek decides to take a seat at the table without her, no reason for him to stand around with his hands in his pocket. He typically starts before she gets to the table anyways, no harm done.

He pulls out his chair at the head of the table and folds his napkin neatly across his lap. Even as close as he is to the table now, he notes that despite the silver platters and plates, he still smells no hint of food. Now that he is thinking about it, he didn’t see any signs of recent cooking in the kitchen either.

Hesitantly, he decides to unveil the smaller silver platter closest to him. Though, as he begins to lift the lid, he’s taken aback by the acidic, rancid smell that the lid was disguising underneath. What looks like a mound of congealed, solidified blood is what waits for him. But he can tell from the mass of fuzzy growing mold and the moving bugs that have taken refuge on top, that it is in fact that tomato aspic that the couple had for dinner a little over a month ago. The mass leaks juice from it, just about to spill out over the silver platter and stain their tablecloth.

The mass stares at him, enticing him further. “Uh, Bev…what is this?”

He gets up from his chair, leaning into the silver platter, there is something inside of it. Floating, silver and shiny right in the middle of the ‘dinner’. He leans in further, desperate to get a better view. That is when he feels a hand on the back of his head.

A sweet, gentle, once-loving voice chimes in from behind him.

“Eat up, my love.” He can almost hear the stretch of her skin as she smiles, pushing his face directly into the moldy mess in front of him. Over and over again. Her strength is unlike anything he thought she was ever capable of. Her now long, sharp nails claw into his scalp, threatening to rip it straight from his head. Derek desperately struggles, but all in vain as he feels one final sensation. The icy, agonizing, betraying feeling of what he assumes to be Beverly’s prized knife that she bought herself on their ten-year anniversary, plunging into his back.

The last thing he hears is his wife humming to the tune of nothing at all.

At 2:40 a.m., the Beverly and Derek household is calm. There are no more bad dinners, no more secrets being kept, no more hidden transformations in the dark. All is well.

Beverly dances around the living room to the jingle of one of her favorite songs on the radio, her new mop in hand as she waits for her meat to be done cooking. She can hear the fatty beef sizzling on the stovetop; it should be done any second now. She is trying out a new recipe tonight, and she thinks it is going to be absolutely delicious. As the song nears its end, Beverly thanks her partner and then promptly throws it to the ground. She heads to the kitchen, satisfyingly, it isn’t nearly as clean as the rest of the house.

An arm there, a leg there, she will clean it for later. She goes and checks on the meat, it’s perfect. She had originally tried it straight from the source, but it was rather tough so she thought cooking it might be a bit better. She takes out her favorite plate that she saves only for the most special occasions and fills up with the big chunks of meat, and slathers the viscous, red gravy on top of it.

She takes a seat at the head of the table, ready to have one of the only enjoyable meals she has had in a long time.

His lifeless, caring eyes stare at her from across the table. His stapled together smile shines brightly on his silver throne, thankful for her savoring his meal that he gave her, enticing her to enjoy every single part of him

I am sluggish and content in simply sitting around and doing nothing. I guess this like achieving is the goal of meditation but without the sense of enlightenment.

I just now walked back home after buying groceries and it's a weird experience looking at people and thinking nothing. I usually have so many thoughts on my mind, I'll judge peoples haircuts, clothing; I will look at people and their facial structure and wonder whether they could star on my independent filmmaking in the future, will look at certain spots for photography opportunities, and many other related activities of a third rate flaneur.

but now I just walk by and everything is the same as the previous thing and theres nothing interesting and I could go for an hour without having a single verbal thought or noticing anything or anyone. I also have no worries or neuroses, just a pure sense of the present moment, though devoid of any spirituality people usually associate with mindfulness.

so is this how normal people function? I now understand why many people are content in such banal and stupid lives, they arent actually secretly suffering of boredom in their 9-5 office job or whatever; to them it's all very easy and natural. I now understand them, I genuinely thought most people were suffering some kind of existential turmoil, but I guess thats not the case. And I dont even mean that most people are some kind of NPC without a rich inner life - it's just that their neurochemistry is good enough  that they can deal with these problems in non neurotic and maladaptive ways so that their life on the whole is actually very happy.

**The Drumming Never Stops**



I’m writing this because I can’t tell anyone about what I’ve experienced. I’m hoping that writing this to an imaginary reader will prove cathartic, but I expect no true relief to come about from this. The Drumming is ceaseless now and has followed me home. I don’t expect it to ever stop. 



When I was 20 years old, I was working a dead end fast food job. I didn't have the kind of money to go to college right after high school, so the plan was to find a job and work to save up enough to go. During my two years working, I have to admit that I grew complacent. After my shifts ended, I felt tired and didn't have the energy or motivation to actually plan on researching colleges or degree programs. To be completely honest though, I was also ignoring college searching because I was losing the motivation to even go to college with each passing year. I only considered going to college because it was presented as the default path. My parents wanted me to be in college. Most of my high school friends were in college. I just assumed it was the right move. After two years of working, I realized I didn't want to blow my money on a degree that I wasn’t even excited to get. And besides, I also felt embarrassed at the thought of entering college at the same time all my friends were graduating. So here I was, working a minimum wage job while living with my parents and three younger siblings. I had no plans for myself, so it was only natural that the universe had plans for me.



In September, my dad suffered a heart attack. It was fatal. He was the primary source of income for the family, and we found ourselves in financial hardship. My mom had a small art hustle while she took care of the house and kids, but it was obviously not enough to keep us  afloat. My parents didn't make me pay rent before my dad died, so now that Dad was gone I definitely needed to pull my load and then some. This is when I started looking for a more serious job. If I was to be a help to the family, I'd need to contribute more than minimum wage. College was definitely off the table now, and I needed to pull myself up, pick a direction, and go. 



Job hunting was more difficult than I expected. Most of the local jobs that paid well required experience, certifications, and degrees I didn't have. There were jobs I was qualified for that paid well, but it required me to move away for long periods of time. These jobs were out of the question because my mom needed help at home. I couldn't leave her in the state she was in. I was really close to landing a job nearby, but of course they hired someone else instead. They said I could apply again in another six months, but I couldn't wait that long. I was checking job websites daily, sometimes multiple times a day in hopes I could be the first to see a job opening and apply for it. 



I finally hit my lucky break in October when I saw an opening for a security guard position. No college degree needed. No prior experience needed. I only needed to be alert, show integrity, and be willing to confront trespassers if it ever came down to it according to the job listing. The pay was a lot more than I was expecting, but I didn't think much of it. I submitted my pristine resumé that I'd spent hours preparing. After completing the application, I shut off my computer and fell to my bed praying I'd get this job. At this point I'd do anything.



It seemed all my effort had paid off when I checked my inbox to see that the employer had emailed me.



“Wednesday at 10PM. Linked below is the address.”



It was strange, but I was too excited to care. Even if I did care, I was too desperate to refuse.



\* \* \*



I arrived 15 minutes early and checked myself before walking into the tiny lobby. Calling it a lobby is actually rather generous. It was more like those small waiting rooms at your local doctor’s office. All the lights were on but there was no one to be seen. I stood still and tried to listen for any signs of activity but only heard the buzzing of the fluorescent lights. Though the lack of activity seemed odd, I thought I’d just take a seat and wait. I was early after all. I glanced out the window and saw the moon doing its best to shine through the clouds and half barren trees bending with the wind. Minute by minute, the time crept by while I stared out the window. 



“See any trespassers?” a flat voice asked from behind me.



I quickly spun around and stood up to face the man in front of me. I hadn’t even heard him approach, and I was frankly embarrassed at being caught off-guard, though I tried not to show it. 



“No, not yet at least,” I replied awkwardly. He was a big man, so I was surprised that he was able to sneak up on me. Maybe he wasn’t particularly stealthy. Maybe I was just mesmerized by the eerie fall scenery beyond the window. I stuck out my hand for a handshake but was thrown off guard when he rejected it.



“A handshake is a serious thing, young man. A handshake is a pledge, and we haven’t made any yet.”



The best I could do was “Oh,” as I retrieved my hand.



“You can call me Mr. Jaeger. Why don’t you follow me.”



He led me down a hall and into his office. It was a stark contrast to the bland, pale reception area. It was reminiscent of the inside of a lodge or log cabin. The walls were dark brown, and the furniture was all wooden. It was sparsely decorated. A nature-themed calendar hung on the wall to my left. A framed family photo sat on a shelf to my right. A company coffee mug sat on the desk. The most notable decoration which tied the room together was a deer head trophy mounted on the wall behind his desk. He took a seat behind his desk and motioned for me to take the seat in front of him. The desk lamp between us was the room’s sole source of illumination. 



As soon as I was seated, Mr. Jaeger took a deep breath and then started. “Look, to be straight with you, I don’t give a shit about your strengths and weaknesses, how you handle conflict, or what you think diversity in the workplace means. Not like any of that even matters out there. This is the easiest job someone could ask for. Anyone with two legs can walk around at night and shine a flashlight. Despite all this, *somehow* people manage to screw it up,” he said with resentment creeping into his voice. I got the impression that the guard before me messed something up pretty badly. “What I need to know,” said Mr. Jaeger, leaning forward on his desk and staring at me, “is that you’re not going to screw us over.”



I waited for a moment before realizing that he was actually expecting an answer from me. I had spent hours upon hours studying interview questions so I would have the perfect response to any question, but I couldn’t have prepared for this. I was actually at a loss for words. I could feel the silence in the room, and Mr. Jaeger’s stare weighed on me. I figured the best move was to just be frank.



I met Mr. Jaeger’s gaze head on, and my composure must have transformed because I noticed a somewhat intrigued look on Mr. Jaeger’s face. “I lost my father, and I need to take care of my family. I don’t bring that up for your sympathy, but because any man worth his salt would do anything in his power to do what needs to be done. If you hire me, I will not let you down.”



I could have sworn I saw the corner of Mr. Jaeger’s mouth twitch into a smile for a split second. He leaned back in his chair and took another deep breath. “Words are cheap, young man, and your paycheck is expensive,” he trailed, “but I trust my judgment.” He then stood up and walked toward me, and I stood up to meet him. He extended his hand to me, and I shook it.

  


\* \* \*



I pulled up to the job site on my first night feeling excited and nervous. I was wearing all the equipment Mr. Jaeger provided: company jacket, tactical bulletproof vest, OC spray, handcuffs, and of course a trusty flashlight. Wearing the complete kit felt badass, and it was definitely cooler than the required fast food uniform. I was still nervous though, because I really didn’t want to mess this up. Mr. Jaeger’s words from training rang in my head over and over. 



“It’s the easiest job you could have. All that I ask is that when you actually need to do something, you do it.”



Staying awake and occasionally walking around on patrols is so little to ask of someone, so I’m genuinely perplexed that anyone could screw that up. What made me nervous was imagining having to actually confront a trespasser. I don’t exactly look intimidating, and I’ve never even been in a fight before. I was nervous that if I were to actually confront someone, I’d mess things up, especially considering how much I was getting paid.



I pulled up to the gate and unlocked it to get my car inside, then once I drove in I closed the gate behind me and locked it. The facility was now under my care. I was the only one there and that would be the case for the next eight hours. I parked my car in a position where I could see as much of the work site as possible. After clocking in on my phone, I climbed out of my car and stretched before exploring my new work site.



The job site was a shipping facility of some sort located somewhat deep in the woods. The facility was shaped like a giant square with a fenced perimeter. Trees and bushes pressed up against each of the fences, except one which had an estimated 30 ft. clearing from the fence to the treeline. I’d learn that most every night, deer would wander into this clearing and graze on the grass. I generally think deer are beautiful animals, but when all you can see are their cloudy eyes reflecting back at you from the flashlight, they appear far more ominous. 



Within the perimeter was a central admin building and a series of sheds, garages, and other auxiliary buildings. These buildings didn’t concern me because they were locked and I wasn’t supposed to patrol inside. There was a parking lot for semi-trucks and another parking lot for employee parking. What took up most of the space were the rows of stacked shipping containers. They were stacked three high, so I couldn’t see over them. Part of my patrol was walking by and ensuring no one was hiding in between them. The last notable area was a large retention pond that sat close to the fence that bordered the clearing. Most of the facility was lit by street lights, but there were many dark corners that I had to check with my flashlight.



Patrols were really easy. On my first and last patrol, I would check the fenceline for cuts and note it in my patrol report. On all the patrols in between, I just walked around the facility shining my flashlight around and looking for anything suspicious. Just the act of shining a light around is enough to deter most people from trespassing. Why rob a company that has active security and risk getting caught when you could just rob the next company over?



Patrols only took about 30 minutes, and I needed to do one patrol an hour, meaning that for the remaining 30 minutes I would sit in my car and keep watch. Sleep and boredom are the two biggest reasons why security guards quit or get fired. I always brought an energy drink to my shift to fight off the drowsiness. I kept myself entertained by listening to audiobooks and long-form youtube videos with only one earbud in. I also kept my windows down so I could listen better, despite the bitter autumn cold. 



I was on my way back to my car after exploring the facility when I heard it for the first time. Over by the pond I could barely make out a sound that I can best describe as muffled rain on a rooftop. This Drumming was loud enough that you could hear it when you paid attention, but faint enough that you couldn’t pinpoint where it was coming from. At the time, I didn’t think much of it and was more concerned with getting back to my warm car.



I climbed back into my car, and the rest of the night passed uneventfully. I imagined there would be danger around every corner, but with every corner that I checked with my flashlight there was nothing of consequence. The sun came out at around 5 AM, and any unease that was present was dispelled, as there were now no shadows I couldn’t see past. When my shift finished the next hour, I opened and closed the gate behind me, just like I had done when I entered. I began my commute home, and even though I was extremely tired from staying up all night, I felt elated. I couldn’t help but smile while driving back with the early sun up in the sky. I had finished my first night with ease, and I was getting paid more than my dad who worked for 30 years at his job. The thought of my dad stung for a moment, but I was too grateful in this moment to let it bring me down. I imagined he would be proud of me.



I arrived home before the rest of my family was awake and crawled into bed where I was eager to finally get some sleep. I was asleep for an entire 2 hours before I was awakened to the sound of my younger siblings playing in the hallway next to my room. I was so tired that I didn’t want to get up and tell them to quiet down, so I just laid there trying to block out the noise to no avail. Finally, I gathered the strength to get up and tell them to be quiet, but as I was walking to the door, the kids were already leaving to play somewhere else. I sighed, turned around, and walked back to my bed where I collapsed. I laid there waiting for sleep to take me, but it never came. Light from my window was shining through my thin curtains and keeping me awake. 



*I’m gonna need better curtains.*



I laid in bed for about an hour before I decided to just get up and start my day. It’s funny how daylight tricks your brain into being awake. I’d only slept 2 hours, but it hardly felt like it once I got up and went about my day. Before I knew it, there were only a couple hours before my shift started.



*Shit. Do I have enough time to take a nap?* 



*The drive is 45 minutes. It takes 30 minutes to get ready. Show up 5 minutes early. That just leaves about 40 minutes.*



*Probably shouldn’t nap then.*



When I eventually set out to my second shift, I quickly regretted not sleeping earlier in the day. I was already feeling drowsy on the way over. Upon arrival, I entered through the gate, parked my car, and began my shift. 



This was nothing like the previous night. Twenty minutes in, a fog rolled over that was illuminated by the streetlamps. I was finishing up my first patrol when I approached the pond at the edge of the facility. As I got closer, a familiar sound met my ears. The Drumming. The sound of a downpour hitting a rooftop. A thousand fingers rapping on a desk. A roaring sound that’s muffled and muted to the point you can barely hear it. The noise wasn’t coming from beyond the fenceline, nor was it coming from the facility. The sound was just *there* by the pond.



As perplexed and unnerved as I was, I still had the rest of the facility to look after. I was walking back to my car when all of a sudden darkness enveloped the entire site. All at once, the streetlights had turned off, leaving just the cone of my flashlight to illuminate the area. I had thought the site was dark before, but this was on another level. I quickly composed myself and rushed to patrol the area.



Just after a couple minutes of frantically patrolling, the lights came back on. Just like that, everything felt normal again. Still, I checked and double-checked every corner of the site, and there was nothing out of place. When I got back in my car, I reflected on what just happened. I felt silly for being so panicked over what was just nothing. 



*It wasn’t nothing though. All the lights went out. Who wouldn’t panic in that situation? We still don’t know if it was intentional or not.*



*So you think someone intentionally cut the power? And on top of that didn’t even steal anything? Yeah right. Getting scared of the dark when no one else is around is pretty embarrassing. You must’ve looked pretty stupid getting all worked up over nothing.*



*Well I guess it’s a good thing no one’s here to see that then.*



At this point I was only halfway through my shift, and the fatigue mixed with my uneasiness made for a miserable night. I always thought that your sanity was this rigid thing that once broken would never be whole again. You either have it or you don’t. You’re either sane or you’re insane, and the trip to insanity is a one-way ticket. That night redefined how I viewed the matter. I saw things in the corner of my vision that were never there when I went to look. Paranoid thoughts stole my attention. For those last couple hours before sunrise, I would say I was at 60% sanity. Of course, once the sun came out all my worries evaporated and I was left feeling like a fool for ever feeling anxious. It’s astounding how something can feel so real in the moment, only for clarity to hit you once that moment has passed. 



The next several shifts passed without incident, and I mocked myself for ever feeling scared. I’d built up a layer of confidence and was baffled that I could have been so anxious that I’d felt my sanity waiver. I had yet to learn how suddenly this confidence could fall apart.



About a month into the job, I was patrolling the fenceline when I saw a small light past the brush. I had only seen it for a split second before it went away. 



*Was that a flashlight?*



*Probably just a streetlight in the distance obscured by all the trees and bushes.*



*Why haven’t I noticed it before, then? I’ve walked this same route a hundred times by now and I’ve never picked up on it.*



*Just because you only noticed it now doesn’t mean it was never there before. You probably just never noticed it before.*



*Then why am I noticing it now?*



I tried to recreate the exact angle at which I’d walked by the fence to try and see if I could see that light again but to no avail. 



*Maybe there was no light.*



This was my least favorite line of thought. There was no one else to corroborate there ever being a light in the first place. You’d be surprised how easy it is to doubt yourself when there’s no one else around. As perplexed as I was, there was still the rest of the site to look after. Another unsolvable mystery. I continued my patrol and approached the pond. The Drumming was still there. It always is. 



Just as before, when the sun came up I was snapped from my anxious trance. Reason returned and there was nothing to be afraid of. 

  


Out of all the nights of paranoia, one stood out among the rest. Three months into the job I was going about my nightly routine. I was a few hours into my shift when I began to feel increasingly uneasy. Something just felt off, and I couldn’t put my finger on it. Up until this point, I was used to feeling spooked and paranoid on the job. The horror podcasts I’d listen to would make me feel on edge. The absurdly potent energy drinks would make me jumpy. The random bumping noise from the generator would startle me. But this time was different.



I was stirring in my car trying to make sense of why I felt so anxious, and I took out my earbud so I could better focus. I hadn’t cracked open my energy drink yet, so that shouldn’t be making me anxious. I wasn’t listening to anything scary that night, so I can rule that out. I didn’t hear any bumping noises from the generator either. It was only then that I realized. The facility was absolutely silent. You usually hear the frogs croaking or an early bird calling, but there was none of that now. I didn’t realize how much ambient noise existed on that site until it was all missing. I then noticed that I hadn’t seen any deer in the clearing beyond the fenceline like I was used to. Where are they? Why aren’t they here tonight?



Identifying the root of my unease did little in the way of relieving it. After thirty minutes of letting my mind wander in a spiral of paranoia, I finally thought it’d be best to distract myself from it all and decided to listen to a video on my phone. 



About an hour passed, and I was immersed in the video I had put on. I had just started feeling calm when I heard the unmistakable sound of rustling bushes from beyond the fenceline to my right. I’d had run-ins with rabbits and raccoons before, but they were definitely quieter than the noise that night. I could clearly hear it despite it being on the other end of the facility. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t scared at all. What if it was actually a person and I had to fight them off the property?



*Stop it. This is your job. This is what you’re getting paid for. If you screw this up, you can kiss this job goodbye.*



With new resolve I got out of my car and walked over to the source of the noise with OC spray in hand. The rustling of the bushes grew as I approached the fence. As I came to about 10 feet of the fence, the noise stopped, but I heard no noise of the source leaving. I shone my flashlight at the bushes, peering hard to see what was on the other side. The brush on the other end of the fence was so thick that I couldn’t see what was on the other side, but I was certain that there was something. 



I waited dead still. Nothing. No stirring or noise of any kind.



I called out in the most authoritative voice I could muster, “Hey, if there’s someone over there I’m gonna call the cops!” I was trying to intimidate whoever or whatever was out there, but all I was doing was embarrassing myself. Either I was talking to an animal or I was trying to rouse a reaction from someone who obviously would not budge and give away their presence. I stood there for a few more minutes, wondering if whatever caused the noise had slipped away and I couldn’t hear it or worse–maybe I just imagined the noise to begin with. My doubts shattered when I heard a walking noise move away from the fenceline and deeper into the forest. What creeped me out the most at that moment was that those sounded like bipedal footsteps. I’m not an expert on what different animal footsteps sound like, but something instinctual inside me told me that those slow footsteps were from a person.



I spent the rest of my shift on high alert. I didn’t even listen to any music or podcasts because I was so anxious. For three hours, I sat alert. I was so on edge which naturally caused me to hear things that weren’t really there or see things move out of the corner of my vision.



Just like all the other nights where my sanity waned, the rising of the sun harkened the arrival of my mental clarity. Soon, birds came out, and everything returned to normal. I did my final patrol and left as soon as the clock hit 6:00. On my drive back, I had plenty of time to think about what happened. That’s when a thought hit me.



*Were all the animals silent that night because they were scared of whatever made that noise?* *The wildlife was most likely avoiding the area because they were avoiding whatever was on the other side of the fence. That would explain why the deer weren’t in the clearing.*



*Or maybe what you heard* was *a deer, and they weren’t in the clearing because they were in the brush instead.*



*What about the footsteps?*



*They were probably from a deer. Can you describe what deer footsteps sound like? No? Exactly. How can you be certain they were human footsteps when you can’t differentiate them from deer footsteps?*



*Just because I don’t know what deer footsteps (hoofsteps?) sound like doesn’t take away from the fact that it* did *sound like human footsteps. Let’s imagine that deer footsteps and human footsteps sound the same. Wouldn’t that mean there’s a 50/50 chance that it was a deer or a human?*



*Just because there are two options does not mean that the probability of either occurring is equal to each other.* 



A few days after the incident I was reflecting on what happened. While it's exciting to imagine that there was some scary monster or creepy stalker, in all reality it was probably just a deer. To think I could be so spooked by something so docile and innocent. I've always loved deer. In fact they might just be my favorite animal. I smiled thinking about them, but it soon faded when I considered the deer’s point of view. Just as I was scared of whatever lay behind the fence, so was the deer. It froze hoping to go unnoticed by what it thought was a predator. If only it knew that I would never dream of hurting any of its kind. We were both standing in fear of what was on the other side of the fence, when the reality was that neither of us had the slightest intention of bringing harm to the other. Or who knows, maybe it really was a monster or serial killer. I’ll never know for sure. At least that’s what I had thought back then. 



The following nights were uneventful. The deer returned to the field. The croaking of the frogs reverberated endlessly through the night. My end of shift reports took barely any time at all because there really was nothing to report. One night there was rustling in the bushes nearby, but when I looked, it was just a raccoon climbing out on a tree branch. As nights came and went with nothing notable occurring, I thought back to the incident with the noise behind the bushes, and the half of me that suspected it was just a deer won out. The paranoia that had built up over the past months began to subside. I hadn’t heard or seen anything strange in a long time, and frankly I began to feel embarrassed at just how jittery and paranoid I was. I guess that over time I just got used to everything. The magic and wonder was gone. But that was okay. For a brief moment, I believed there were no monsters.



\* \* \*



It was June now, and the nights warmed up. Most nights I didn’t even need to wear a jacket. I pulled up to the site at 10PM and locked myself into the facility like I had done so many times before. I did my initial patrol, noticing no new cuts in the fences or any other abnormalities. Upon finishing I sat in my car and kept watch.



An hour passed and a familiar feeling crept up on me. My leg began to bounce up and down uncontrollably. I had the constant compulsion to look behind me, and while I was looking behind me I felt like I needed to look at what was in front of me. Then I needed to check my left and right sides. No matter what direction I was looking, there were three other directions I wasn’t looking. This led to me constantly swiveling my head to try and get a 360 degree sight line which was an impossible task.



*You can’t see all around you at once, but you can* hear*.*



My windows were already rolled all the way down, so I just took a deep breath and stared straight ahead in one direction and took a moment to hone my ears and listen. 



Nothing. Like before.



I had a mini heart attack when my phone timer went off, signaling me to go on another patrol of the property. As I began walking the perimeter, my mind began racing.



*Why is it so quiet?*



*Because there’s something out there.*



*But what?*



*Probably just a deer. Like last time.*



*But we don’t know for sure if it even was a deer last time.*



*What else do you think it could have been?*



And then the lights went out. The lights have gone out routinely since I started working this job, but they catch me off guard every single time. I was already jumpy before, and the lights going off raised my heart rate even further. The suddenness of the lights turning off caused me to stop in my tracks for a second, and that’s when I heard a noise from across the facility. I probably wouldn’t have been able to hear it over my own footsteps, but since I was standing still I could make out the sound of running steps. I waited another second to confirm what I was hearing. This wasn’t my mind playing tricks on me. This was the real thing. I felt fear for a moment, but then my better instincts kicked in.



*This is what you’re getting paid to deal with. If you screw this up now, it’s over. Time to earn your paycheck.*



I began to run towards the sound. The only light was the beam that came from my flashlight, but since I was sprinting I struggled to focus my flashlight effectively. I closed in on the figure which had apparently stopped running and was now stooped over by the pond. Just before making contact, I dropped my flashlight on the ground so I would have my hands free to wrestle and detain them.



As I hit the figure with the force of my whole body, a scream rang out that I will never forget. As I was trying to pin the trespasser, desperate cries called out that I couldn’t understand. Each second I fought, I had a terrible feeling in my stomach. What I had expected to be a violent fight in order to detain them actually resulted in an easy victory even without being able to see anything in the pitch dark.



I was struggling to fasten the handcuffs in the dark, when the facility lights all came back on once more. Pinned underneath me was a woman who could not have weighed more than 100 pounds. Tears were running down her face and she was trying to pull herself back towards the spot she had been bent over when I initially tackled her, but my full weight kept down any hopes she had. She was pleading with me through sobs in a language I could not understand. She had dark skin, but I couldn’t make out her specific ethnicity.



Despite my obvious advantage over her, she relentlessly kept pulling. In the midst of this, I noticed the familiar sound of the Drumming, and it  was louder than ever now. A pit rose in my stomach when I realized that it was coming from where the woman was hunched over before I tackled her. It’s like it was calling to her. At this point my curiosity had risen to its apex, and I guess you could say that it was calling to me too. The Drumming that has been present since the beginning of my time at this job. The Drumming that birthed my paranoia and made me question my sanity. The source of it was right there, and there was no way I could walk away from it now.



I cuffed the woman to the nearby chain link fence, picked up my flashlight that I’d dropped, and walked over to the place that the woman was so desperate to get to. The muffled Drumming got louder until I arrived at a square patch of grass that had been cut out of the ground. The patch was pre-cut, and it was obvious that the woman had known about it and had tossed it aside. I looked over at the space where the patch had been covering and found a hatch that was now slightly ajar, being propped open by a pair of bolt cutters. There was a lock on the hatch that was already half cut by the woman before I had arrived.



My whole body was shaking, and I had this terrible feeling that I was about to do something that would get me in a lot of trouble, but I was already committed. I picked up the bolt cutters and finished cutting the lock and lifted the hatch completely open. Beneath the hatch was a giant chamber that went so deep that the light from outside was not enough to illuminate the inside. There was no ladder or other way down, just a straight drop into the deep. The noise coming from below was no longer distant or muted, but rather roaring and thunderous. I stared down into the black abyss with a pit in my stomach. I had no guess as to what could be down there. Part of me was tempted to just close the hatch and let it all go, but I couldn’t pass up this one chance to see what had been stirring my curiosity for so long. I finally shined my flashlight down the hole.



There were no monsters hiding in that pit. There were no masked killers planning their next spree. There were no spirits waiting to be released. Instead in that dark expanse was a sea of half-naked people staring directly up at me. They all shared the same pleading expression as the woman from outside. All of their hands had been bound, and all of their mouths were gagged. Across the cavern, every one of them was frantically stomping their feet on the ground to generate as much noise as they possibly could.



I just knelt there dazed, trying to process everything. My heart skipped a beat when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I spun around, and was met with the sight of Mr. Jaeger. 



“What,“ I stammered. “What is all this?“



”This,” he gestured to the facility, “this is what you’re getting paid for. Loss prevention is your job, and I must say you’ve actually done quite a good job. You’ve even managed to clean up after the last guard’s mess,” he said looking at the woman stuck to the fence, her face plastered with terror. She tried desperately to pull free, but it worked as well as you’d expect.



My head was swimming as I finally realized what my job here really was. “This…this is so fucked up…I didn’t know!” I sputtered, more to myself than to him.



”Of course you didn’t. None of them do at first.” I felt nauseous. “Look,” he said, assuming an air of sincerity. “I’m not mad. I figured this would happen eventually. It’s always rough in the beginning, but you get used to it.”



“I’m not staying here! You’re insane if you think I’m not going to report this!”



“You don’t want to do that. Trust me.” My eyes immediately darted to his side and, just as I feared, I saw he had a holstered pistol on his hip. He must have seen the panic wash over my face and noticed me staring because he held his hands up and continued. “To be clear, *I* have no intention of harming you, young man, but I can’t guarantee you’ll be safe from those above. If you reach out to the authorities, you’ll be signing your death warrant. You have no clue how high this goes up. Trust me, this isn’t a cage you want to rattle.”



I lifted my gaze to meet his. I was expecting to see a malicious and hostile look. I was expecting an intimidating stare that told me to get in line or suffer the consequences. Instead I was met with something entirely different. A look of sincere concern covered his face. I didn’t know what to think. I felt hopeless and scared. I wanted to believe with all my heart that he was bluffing, but when I looked in his eyes I knew he was telling the truth. 



“I can tell you’re still hesitant. It’s a bitter pill to swallow.” Mr. Jaeger reached into his pocket and pulled something out. “But a spoonful of sugar…” his voice trailed off and he began writing something down. He ripped a paper out and handed it to me, and only then did I realize that in my hands was a check.



All the fear and racing thoughts were instantly quiet. In that moment, there was no Mr. Jaeger. There was no underground pit. There were no monsters behind the bushes. There was just a tiny sheet of paper with a staggering number of zeroes on it. After what must have been minutes of staring at the check, I looked up at Mr. Jaeger.



”You’re not wrong for taking it.” He put a hand on my shoulder and gave a sympathetic squeeze. “Go home and take care of your mother and your siblings. I’ll take care of the rest tonight.” 



I did as I was told.

It’s been three months since that day. I no longer hear the Drumming at work. They’ve given up, as they know where I stand now. Everyday I try to push it out of my mind, but when I lie down to sleep in the dead quiet, I can still hear the familiar distant, muffled stomping. The Drumming never stops.

I’ve done these type of post when i go to other places and they have worked out well, I always figure why not ask actual locals.



Coming up  on October 3-13th, my girlfriend, her mom and her Irish step dad will be going to Dublin for a week.  He moved to the US many years ago but returns to Ireland every I’d say 3-5 years say to see family, so he knows more of what’s a “authentic pub” than I do but he may not know the good spots that someone living in Ireland currently would know. 



Me and my girlfriend really appreciate non tourist places, it sounds cliche but we like places that locals would choose. They can be new recent places that are doing excellent food and drinks or establishments that have been around for 50 or more years that have become a staple in the community.



If you guys had to pick 1 maybe 2 and if you feel the need to add honorary mentions thats fine too, but ideally if you had to choose 1 or 2 places for…..



A greasy spoon breakfast spot

Your favorite no frills pub or (or pubs we will be drinking alot). My Irish father in law says the kind with no TV's and low ceilings 

Your favorite place to grab coffee 

Your favorite place to get Indian food

I’m sure this one is hard to choose one but favorite chip shop

Your favorite non pub type bar, like a place to go for cocktails

Your favorite bakery



Again, some people find these type of post annoying and usually tell me to fuck off, but it’s worth a shot.

But that morning, no rider was accepting my booking and even Grab showed “no drivers found.” With no other choice, I decided to take a jeepney instead.

I was seated in the middle part of the jeep, my bag in front of me, while holding a cup of coffee. A man then boarded — around his mid-40s, brown-skinned, wearing a white checkered polo, maong pants, and white rubber shoes. At the same time, two older men sat on both sides of me.

Not long after, the man in front suddenly started panicking, saying there was a centipede (“alupihan”) crawling toward me. Since it was heavily raining at that time, I believed him — thinking it was possible for insects to climb into the jeep. He pointed at my feet and umbrella, insisting that I shake it off before it bit me. Some passengers even flashed lights toward my side as if trying to help.

Because of the commotion, I lifted my feet and raised my umbrella — not realizing that my bag had already been discreetly opened. After the panic, the same man who started it quickly got off the jeep. That’s when another passenger announced out loud that my cellphone had been stolen. True enough, my bag was opened and my iPhone was gone.

I immediately got off to chase the suspect, but he had already disappeared into the busy road. I later reported the incident to the police, but recovery is unlikely since the area’s CCTV was not working. 

The police officers refuses to help due to no CCTV nor witnesses on my statement. They were asking for photo atleast. How can I have that if it is my phone that is stolen? They also decline to trace the person I described as he can deny what happened. The man did it still in my head. It takes days before I can secure a report thou my case is still under investigation.

I was with my partner. We shared the same respect and love for each other, almost perfect, inseparable Everyone adored our relationship, even the administrator of the school. I went into her office to hand her some files and she brought up my relationship with my boyfriend. Saying how lovely we are as a couple. She gave me a painting, a four-foot-tall painting that was hanging on her office wall. It was full of vibrant colours, kind of like a modern art style. The one you can tell that they used a typical paintbrush to paint a wall. She mentioned that we deserve this as a gift and I appreciated it. I was even excited to show my boyfriend this.
I came out of the office and saw a close friend, we chatted for a while but then he went to check his phone to read a message and in surprise mixed with concern then showed me a picture of a hand with multiple triangle shapes carved in the palm and fingers. It gave me goosebumps. Then it shifted to my partner's vision, looking directly at his hand with worry and fear. 

We met outside the cafe library. They sell books and coffee. He sat across the table from me. In tears, with his hands squeezing each other, while his head looked straight down at the table. I talked to him, maybe assuring him that it'll be alright, I held his hand firmly and he looked at me with teary, pleading eyes. He said something that broke my heart and made heads turn on us. Before we met, I sensed that it was what I feared and that the things in his hands were the signs that it was coming near. He gave me a thick ring and two thin ones that don't fit my fingers well, supposedly it's a reminder of his presence. I tried begging him not to leave me and even mentioned to him the painting that surprisingly fits in my bag. I heard something from the real world that woke me up. There, I realized I was in a dream and I didn't like it there, so I opened my eyes and everything that happened flashed in my eyes.

It was my ex-boyfriend, my partner in my dreams. In that very moment, I realised that I could never handle it if that happened to him and I wouldn't wish it even after the pain and trauma he caused me. I also realized that the part when he was sitting across me happened to us in real life. The time he begged for me to stay with him, was a difficult time for us to be together and I was already suffocating from the mistreatment and arguments every day. We were the opposite of what we are in my dreams when we were together. Yet, I still love him until now and I can't really deny it, but I wouldn't come back just because of the idea of what we could be showed up in my dream.

I just finished a paper that completely dismantles a core belief we’ve been taught for decades—that ​**deflation is an economic disaster**.

Turns out, this fear is based on a ​**technological flaw**​ in *physical money*(gold, cash). When money was physical, deflation meant there literally weren’t enough coins/bills to transact—so people hoarded, spending crashed, and economies froze. Keynes wasn’t wrong; he was solving a *physical cash problem*.

But we don’t live in that world anymore.

​**Digital money changes everything.​**​

With infinitely divisible digital currency (like Bitcoin, but designed properly), deflation ​**doesn’t cause a liquidity crisis**. It just means prices are represented with more decimal places. Want to buy a coffee priced at 0.00000001 BTC? You can. The transaction doesn’t fail. The economy doesn’t collapse.

​**So what’s the real issue?​**​

Not economics—**user experience**. Nobody wants to type 0.00000001 all day. So we solve it with ​**algorithmic denomination changes**​ (like a software version update). Example: 1 “New Unit” = 0.00000001 “Old Units”. All prices and balances rescale. No value is created or destroyed. It’s purely a UI upgrade—not monetary policy.

​**Why this matters:​**​

* •It invalidates the entire justification for ​**central banks printing money forever**.
* •It ends the need for ​**inflation targeting**. Deflation is safe.
* •It exposes modern monetary policy as a ​**political tool**, not an economic necessity.
* •It opens the door for ​**non-political, rules-based money**​ (like a transparent, gold-backed digital standard).

We’ve been fighting a ghost from the age of physical cash. It’s time to move on.

If you’re interested in the full argument—with formal models, historical evidence, and a blueprint for a post-Keynesian monetary system—check out my paper on SSRN:

​**​\[** https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=5436418 **\]​**​

​**TL;DR:​**​ Deflation isn’t dangerous anymore. Digital money can be divided infinitely, so hoarding doesn’t crash the economy. The “liquidity trap” is dead. Central banking as we know it is obsolete.

Today, I went to GameStop to get two of the shiny code cards for the box art legendary Pokémon event that just started today. Just wanted two, one for each game. Within 15 minutes of the store opening, all the codes were gone.

Now I get that this doesn’t seem like a big deal, but it is for me because it’s the one thing I could do for myself as a treat. After paying bills, I’m left with about $100 to feed myself and my cats until next pay day. I’m not actually sure if that’s even right because my account keeps going in the negative every time and then I have to use my credit cards again.

I don’t go out, I don’t drink or smoke, I can’t remember the last time I really saw my friends, let alone hung out with my family. Treat myself to a snack or a coffee drink? Absolutely not. I go to work and go home, just to stay above water. That’s it.

I’m going to try again to get these codes because I know the event is for more than a day, but I honestly have no hope whatsoever. And I’m sure I’ll see scalpers selling them very soon.

I just want a break.  This small, stupid thing, would’ve made my week.

I get that I’m probably in a better spot than others and I am grateful, but I just needed a moment to allow myself to be a bit upset.

Starbucks isn’t really my go-to coffee spot, but it is where I get the beans for my espresso machine. They’ve got a solid selection, and I honestly think their Arabicas are some of the best. So every now and then, I swing by just to grab a bag of beans, finely ground.

Out of all the times I’ve been there, I’ve only once had a barista mention their loyalty program. Maybe I’m just late to the hype, or maybe I’ve been dodging it without realizing 😅

But I gotta say, I appreciated the barista who took a moment to actually explain it. They gave a quick rundown, answered my questions, and didn’t make it feel salesy at all. That little gesture stuck with me.

# ☕ Paul Hastings

* As of **Sept 25**, they’re already running *informal coffee chats* with 1Ls.
* If you’re targeting them, get your materials polished now — this is a classic sign they’re moving early.
* **And PLEASE PLEASE remember. The associates who do these chats are explicitly asked their thoughts on the students they meet and recruiting takes notes. So dress snappy and present your best self.** Don't show up in a t-shirt. Don't take the zoom call from the chin-side-angle on your bed. Make sure the room isn't a hot mess. It makes an impression, and not the one you want.

# 📅 Hogan 2L Application Openings Creep Earlier

* Hogan opened 2L apps in *late April* last cycle. This year? **January 1.**
* They will also be doing dual 1L/2L offers**.**
* Translation: expect more firms to shift timelines up — you don’t want to get caught flat-footed, especially since they basically make no announcements and assume everyone will just figure it out magically.

# 🌀 Kirkland & Ellis Shake-Up

* Insider update from KE NYC: last year’s 1L retention gamble backfired, and now they’re *slashing the 1L program.* See below screenshot for exact language. 
* New structure: **1L = optional 4-week stint** (not the traditional 10 weeks), with big law pay and a $25k stipend (presumably to help cover the other 6 weeks you would normally expect to be paid.)
* **2L recruiting opens Nov 1** across all offices, with plans to be *done by spring ‘26* (likely Feb/March based on internal paperwork deadlines).
* A Kirkland NY recruiter also told students: if you accept a 2L offer, there will be “*exciting options*” for your 1L summer. (Unclear what that means in practice, but seems to be a pivot.)

#  Suffolk Timelines

* Seems to be downplaying applying to 1L positions at all
* Suggest that at the earliest students should apply Nov. 1 (no mention of Oct. 1 recruiting). 

# 🗓 Countdown Reminder

* **Oct 1** apps are right around the corner — 5 days left until the first wave opens!

My husband (32M) and I (34F) have been together for 12 years, married for 11. He is my everything and we've been through a lot so far.   There had been some instances of online (Craigslist ads) at the beginning of our relationship but I don't think this is the case now (we are together constantly when home from work and do really enjoy each other's company) and I'm positive he has not been with someone physically. 

Anyways He started a new job last year in a garage and a couple of months after starting, he was invited to the Christmas party. He got a lift from a female colleague (her dad was driving) which didn't bother me at all but it was after that he was telling me other people's wives went along. I was really hurt tbh, but he's consistently said that no one told him that partners were invited, he was relatively new so didn't speak to everyone at that point. 

He tells me that the same female colleague follows him around, even when he goes for a vape 🤣 I have joked that maybe she fancies him but he says she can f off because he's not interested.

Other people who work at the same place have their wives go in and chat etc. I went to drop a coffee off today and my husband quickly ran outside, spoke to me for a bit, gave me a kiss and went back in. I feel so silly for feeling this way, but I can't help but think he is embarrassed of me. 

Just for some context, I have a disability and have unfortunately put on a little bit of weight due to being less mobile. (Tbh he has a little too). I try to make an effort with my looks and wear make up and pretty dresses etc. (my standard of making an effort, of course everyone is different and I only wear make up due to being insecure. I wish I had the confidence to go ""naked""!).
How would you proceed in my situation?

1nr2zum,https://i.redd.it/93bvh1qlsirf1.png,"Bask Health - Business Ideas for a Small Town: Low-Cost, High-Demand","The pet industry has grown into a $60 billion business in the United States. [Small town](https://bask.health/blog/ideas-for-a-business-in-a-small-town) business ideas can lead to amazing success stories. Look at Walmart—they built their empire by starting retail stores in small towns.

Running a business in a smaller community has some big advantages. You'll spend less on operations and get to build strong relationships with loyal customers. Small towns may have fewer people, but they give you a chance to dominate your local market. Pet ownership in U.S. homes rose from 56% in 1988 to 65% in 2016. This shows how certain services can thrive even in smaller communities.

Let's look at some practical, budget-friendly business ideas that small towns really need. We'll cover everything from reliable local services to health and digital ventures that match today's needs. You'll learn how to spot chances that could become the life-blood of your town's economy.

***Ready to discover the best business ideas for a small town? Scroll down now!***

# Key Takeaways

* Small towns offer lower costs, loyal customers, and less competition.
* Service businesses like cleaning, childcare, tutoring, and pet care thrive.
* Food ventures (coffee shops, bakeries, food trucks, ice cream) double as community hubs.
* Telehealth, wellness products, and digital coaching create modern opportunities.
* Retail and mobile options (thrift stores, car detailing, crafts) need low startup costs.
* Success comes from meeting real community needs with a personal touch.

# Service-based businesses with steady local demand

Small towns always have profitable [service-based businesses](https://bask.health/blog/business-you-can-start) because they meet basic needs that don't go away. These businesses let you start with little money and earn a steady income from customers who keep coming back.

# Cleaning and handyman services

Cleaning services do well in small communities where families and professionals can't keep up with house maintenance. You can start a cleaning business with just a few hundred dollars worth of supplies and quickly make money from weekly or monthly clients. Handyman services help homeowners fix things that always break down. Some markets let handymen charge [between $176 and $602 per project](https://www.homeadvisor.com/tloc/New-york-NY/Handyman-For-Multiple-Small-Projects/). This makes it a great small-town business that values skills more than money to start.

# Childcare and elder care

Small-town parents just need reliable childcare like anyone else. Starting a daycare means getting certified, butit  helps the whole community. Senior care offers a huge chance to grow. The global senior care industry was worth [$1.02 trillion in 2023](https://www.carebuildersathome.com/franchise/senior-care-business-ideas/) and should grow 7.5% each year through 2032. Services range from driving seniors around and helping with errands to making homes safer for aging in place.

# Tutoring and test prep

Small towns lack specialized academic help, and tutoring fills this gap perfectly. You can start tutoring from home with almost no costs. Good tutoring programs help kids with homework, test prep, reading, writing, math, and study skills. Students often improve by 2+ grade levels in reading and math with proper tutoring.

# Pet care and grooming

[Pet grooming businesses](https://bask.health/blog/good-small-business-ideas) keep growing yearly, and American pet owners will likely spend over $150 billion by 2025. You can run a traditional shop, mobile service, or self-serve station based on your budget. Dog walking needs just $500-$2,000 to start and could bring in $30,000-$60,000 yearly. Pet services work great in small towns because people want something close by, and local entrepreneurs know exactly what pet owners in their community want.

# Food and drink ideas that bring people together

Local food establishments act as social anchors that help build relationships in small communities. These businesses succeed by adapting to small-town life's rhythms and their customers' priorities.

# Coffee shop with local flair

Coffee shops naturally become a small town's heart and create [community hubs](https://bask.health/blog/business-ideas-start-in-small-town) where people connect daily. A hybrid coffee shop and bar concept can maximize revenue by serving different customer needs throughout the day, which works great for entrepreneurs with limited capital. Successful owners target 70-90% profit margins on specialty drinks through careful cost calculations. Local art displays, open mic nights, and your town's unique character can help your shop stand out. The coffee industry keeps growing, and shops remain the fastest-growing food service segment with [7% annual growth](https://pos.toasttab.com/blog/on-the-line/how-to-start-a-coffee-shop?srsltid=AfmBOoqAwzyLgfuE3VVu8ZMB1Mb23O6mvNMGNMQetJgPbkCfV7JJHYKY).

# Bakery or dessert bar

A local bakery captures small-town charm perfectly. These spots draw morning commuters looking for pastries and coffee, along with customers who want custom cakes for special occasions. Industry experts say bakeries thrive when they focus on specialty items like gluten-free options or artisan breads. Local youth employment helps maintain strong community connections. Home-based bakeries can be a great starting point to test market demand without committing to a full storefront.

# Food truck for events and markets

Food trucks give owners more flexibility than traditional restaurants. Owners can move between neighborhoods, events, and markets while showcasing local ingredients. This mobility lets them follow the crowds—from festival attendees to farmers' market shoppers and corporate lunch crowds. Food trucks also fill the catering gap that many small towns have through event rentals. Commissary kitchens make these ventures available to new food entrepreneurs since they don't need to cook on-site.

# Ice cream shop for seasonal crowds

Ice cream shops become local favorites that attract families, tourists, and residents looking for sweet treats during warm months. These shops can grow into candy sales, birthday parties, or specialty desserts with startup costs nowhere near full restaurants. A successful ice cream business often pulls visitors from nearby communities. Creating [regional flavor profiles](https://bask.health/blog/businesses-thrive-in-small-towns) with local ingredients like Michigan cherries or seasonal fruits helps showcase your town's character.

# Health and digital business ideas for modern needs with Bask Health

Small-town entrepreneurs can find exciting opportunities in the telehealth revolution. Virtual healthcare visits have [jumped by 400%](https://bask.health/blog/new-business-ideas-small-towns) since 2020. This growth helps about 30 million Americans who live in healthcare deserts get vital medical services.

# How to start your own telehealth business

Your telehealth business needs several building blocks. You should set up a legal entity (LLC) and get essential identifiers like an EIN and NPI. The next step is choosing a HIPAA-compliant platform that integrates smoothly with existing systems. Most businesses need $10,000-$300,000 to start, but white-label platforms can lower these costs substantially.

# Bask Health's role in telehealth business management

Bask Health has created a 'Shopify for Telehealth' platform that takes care of complex tasks like provider networks, compliance, and technology infrastructure. Our solution has:

* HIPAA-compliant video consultation systems
* End-to-end encryption
* White-label customization options
* Nationwide provider networks

Business owners can launch their ventures in days instead of months. They can also reduce typical startup costs from $70,000-$100,000.

# Selling health ecommerce products online

The wellness industry will [reach $8.99 trillion](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/blog/heath-ecommerce-wellness-online) by 2028. This growth creates profitable opportunities for online health product sales. Health supplements show strong market potential. The global market should grow from $151.80 billion in 2024 to $266.80 billion by 2033.

# Offering virtual services like consulting or coaching

Digital wellness coaching blends human expertise with technology to overcome traditional barriers of cost and accessibility. Coaches can help clients with:

* Lifestyle modification support
* Fitness guidance
* Stress management techniques
* Accountability partnerships

These [virtual services](https://bask.health/blog/types-of-telehealth-services) provide customized guidance through accessible digital interfaces. They make excellent business opportunities for small-town entrepreneurs.



# Unique retail and mobile business ideas

Smart entrepreneurs succeed with retail and mobile ventures that need minimal startup money while serving specific community needs. These flexible business models let you serve multiple small towns from one operation.

# Thrift store or vintage boutique

The [secondhand market](https://bask.health/blog/small-town-businesses-that-thrive) keeps growing and should hit $350 billion by 2028, growing three times faster than regular apparel sales. About 44% of thrift store owners launch their business with less than $5,000. These stores help save 92 million tons of textiles from landfills each year. Your profits will grow when you organize merchandise into clear sections and showcase unique vintage items. Here's a big advantage: you'll never owe money to manufacturers or middlemen since most inventory comes through donations.

# Mobile car wash or detailing

The global car detailing market sits at $37.41 billion and should reach $56.59 billion by 2032. This business model lets you go straight to customers' homes or workplaces. Starting costs range from $5,000-$25,000, and solo detailers earn $5,000-$15,000 monthly. Top performers make over $147,000 yearly. The profit margins are impressive at 60-80%.

# Photography or event planning

Small-town photography businesses thrive through weddings, senior portraits, and community celebrations. Many photographers match their previous income within months of starting. Event planners can handle weddings, birthday parties, and corporate gatherings. Success comes from specialized services and strong relationships with local vendors.

# Crafts, candles, or organic skincare

American candle sales top $3 billion yearly, according to the National Candle Association. [Handcrafted products](https://bask.health/blog/ideas-for-small-business-from-home) that cost $5 to make can fetch $20 or more. Personalized crafts can see profit margins up to 100%, especially during festivals. You can run these creative ventures from home and sell directly to consumers.

# Conclusion

Small-town entrepreneurship has great potential in many industries. This piece explores business ideas that don't need much investment but are in high demand in smaller communities. Service businesses like cleaning, childcare, and pet grooming are a great way to build steady income through loyal customers. Coffee shops and bakeries do more than just make money - they become community hubs that turn into local landmarks.

The digital world has changed what small-town businesses can achieve. Telehealth is a chance to serve communities with lower operating costs than traditional healthcare. Our team at Bask Health makes telehealth entrepreneurship available through our detailed platform. We take care of complex backend systems so you can build customer relationships and grow your business.

Retail and mobile businesses give entrepreneurs the flexibility they need in smaller markets. Thrift stores, mobile detailing services, and handcrafted products show how creative thinking turns limited resources into successful ventures. These businesses are the life-blood of small-town economies because they understand local community needs.

Your small-town business will soar when you spot real community needs and address them well. Less competition, stronger customer bonds, and lower overhead costs work in your favor. Small towns offer fertile ground for business growth, whether you choose a traditional storefront or our digital telehealth platform. The most successful ventures combine modern business practices with the personal touch that makes small-town life special.

First repair was the milk temperature sensor, which makes it unusable it it breaks (I don't know why), took a full month between getting the box ship it an get it back.

Now the machine is broke down again, it's having pressure issues and coffee is not coming out very hot. Breville  will fix it under warranty (which expires in Dec 2025) but I am starting to think that I got a bad machine in general or maybe that was a bad batch (as this is the 2nd machine and I got both within 7 days)  I asked Breville to replace it as it's the second time it goes in and they say they only consider replacements if it goes back again for the same issue.

I am considering cutting my loses and selling it when I get it back on eBay, probably recoup \~$400-500...  can show it was just serviced by Breville and has a couple months of warranty and probably that will entice a buyer... and then  buy it again with a fresh warranty and hopefully better reliability.

I actually realized they changed it a bit, seems now the frother stick is different and the screen a little larger, so may even be a newer model with better internals?

Do you think I got a bad batch machine? or is it just bad luck? I really don't want to sell it because I really do love it (super easy to use) but I don't want to get hit again next

I was thinking sixflags because I have a season pass and some extra tickets that come with it or like... A coffee shop. But I'm not sure those are great picks.

Oh wait! You’d still be right. These ARE thoughts I keep locked away, just a tad more messier, tad more philosophical, tad more nonsensical. Not sexy at all. No heat here. At all. It’s cold, numbingly so. 

Go away, before you read this and are left wondering why you chose to read through this unintelligible post. 

Did you know I almost typed dairy instead of diary when I wrote the title? Is this a sign? To go make Tiramisu? I make a darn good Tiramisu. With the lady finger soaked in Marsala and coffee, layered with mascarpone cream and some whipped cream. May be get some of that whipped cream on my.. shit! Took a detour for a second there. 

See what I mean? How messy and confusing  it’s in my head? 

Performance anxiety, I’ve grappled with it for a very long time, a really really long time, as far as I can remember. Constant imposter syndrome. Sometimes I wonder if I would be a whole another person without my performance anxiety. Sometimes I wonder if I should let my shoulders loose, stop acting like everything will crumble if I let go for a second. 

May be it’s this constant need to seek validation elsewhere that makes me lose interest quicker than most. There’s this forever  urge to walk away from things I was interested in five minutes ago. 

Don’t get me wrong, even my plan Cs have plan Cs. Sometimes I am a little meticulous like that. But then most times, I want to not commit to anything that’s not work- not people, not hobbies, not nothing. 

Side bar- I love em dashes. Have used them all my adult life. And now I am being told this looks like the work of an AI? A character that I have loved all my adult life makes me look inhuman?! Fuck you for taking away my almost nothing humanity. 

Any whoooo, where was I? Yes, the urge to walk away. Is this fear? Although, I want to blame it on social media. Yes, let’s blame social media for my personality, shall we? It’s cheaper than therapy. I’d start an account, do something that’s deemed creative and then someone would drop a hint asking me to think about going professional. Bam! I lose interest, become inconsistent. Delete that account and go into hiding. Three months later, new account, new creativity unleashed, something else to walk away from. 

Is this who I am? Constantly walking away from everything and everyone?

If only I had a dime… sigh. You know where I’m going with that. 

Wait when did we get to commitment issues from performance issues?! Why was I writing this?! 

Righhhht! When I don’t get an intended outcome, there’s this nag in the back of my head to keep trying, to fix it, to get that “good job”. The notes were all wrong yesterday. That’s what I was told. Heck, even I realized it. I spent the whole evening thinking about the wrong notes. I made a plan, to work on it. I will get it right today. I will get that great job today. So my question being, when my performance anxiety is driving me to keep trying, why do I also walk away, lose interest? What an irony! 

Anyway, what am I doing here exactly? I have a place to write, a place where people look forward to reading what I scribble. And yet, here I am, in an anon account, spending the past twenty minutes on a post that I am probably going to delete in under 24 hours. 

Should I delete this account for good and leave? What exactly am I doing here?

You know how my car's cup holders are permanently stained from that iced coffee incident? I've basically accepted my fate as someone who will always have crumbs on the passenger seat. But last week, I was trying to eat a salad while parked between errands, and the container kept sliding off my lap. I felt like I was in a losing battle with gravity and a piece of lettuce.



That was the final straw that made me finally order a steering wheel tray. It’s just a simple piece of molded plastic with a lip and a cup holder, but honestly, it’s a game-changer. I can set my food down, use my phone as a GPS, and even scribble a note without everything threatening to tumble to the floor. It clips on securely and folds away flat, so it’s not a hassle to store when I’m actually driving.



It got me thinking about the history of eating in cars. Did you know the first drive-in restaurants popped up in the 1920s, but they had ""carhops"" who would bring trays that attached to the outside of your rolled-up window? My little tray feels like the modern, personal version of that. It’s such a simple solution, but it’s made those rushed lunches in the car feel almost civilized. No more lap-anxiety!

**Day 2: Treetopia**

Visit Treetopia Park and do the cable cars + hanging bridges. Lunch at the park.



**Day 3: Coffee/Chocolate/Nightwalk Tour**

Don Juan tour from 5:30-7:30pm.

(Could definitely do another activity this morning - was thinking we'd ask the B&B owners for their recommendations.)

Chapter 4: The Knocking

Loud, continuous knocking shook the door, followed by a deep, gentle “Hello?”
“What the fuck?” I thought, heart pounding.
Rich had said no one was allowed in the 20, mile zone. And especially with the fire going on near by. staff only. A lost hiker, maybe? I didn’t know, but the knocking grew louder, harder, insistent.
I stood, glancing at the machete by the desk. Better be safe than sorry. I slowly get up to grab it, then tucking it behind me to avoid scaring a potential hiker, and I then crept to the door. Just in case, I called out, “Hello?”

The knocking stopped. Dead silence.
I gripped the knob, turned it slowly, and pulled the door open. Nothing. Not a soul, not a footprint in the dirt. The woods stared back, still, like they were holding their breath. I grabbed the flashlight from the desk and circled the cabin, staying close to its walls. Crickets chirped, owls hooted in the distance—peaceful, normal. But something felt wrong, like the silence was waiting to return.

“What the actual hell was that?” I muttered, heading back inside. I locked the door, checked every window, and shut off the lights. It was nearly 1:30 a.m. I’d done my nightly check outside, as Josh had asked, and everything seemed fine—except for that knocking. The outhouse hole in the bathroom caught my eye as I passed. It was too deep, too dark, like it led somewhere beyond dirt. I shivered, avoiding it.

Exhausted, I brushed my teeth, washed my face, grateful for the heated water. I changed, climbed into my sleeping bag on the twin bed—clean but well-worn, its sheets questionable. The cabin was chilly, the sleeping bag a smart choice. I zipped up, got comfortable, and passed out, the woods’ peaceful sounds lulling me to sleep. A good night, despite everything.

I woke around 8:30 a.m. the next morning. Not having slept well from last night. I unzip my sleeping bag, the cold air biting me. Getting out of my sleeping bag took serious effort, who likes waking up freezing? 

Istarted my routine, start the coffee, brush my teeth, put on clean clothes, have my coffee, and be ready for my new life ahead. 

(Several months later)

Time has flew by out here. 
When I arrived, it was chilly, leaves just falling. Now, a blanket of snow draped everything, turning my zone into a breathtaking wonderland. The beauty of the woods never ceased, but I couldn’t shake the memory of that first night’s knocking, or the way the silence felt alive, waiting.

I spent days patrolling, mapping landmarks, distinctive rocks, creeks, trees. I noted animal patterns. a massive buck with an impressive rack leading a deer herd, squirrels scurrying, a colorful duck flying overhead with a unique neck band. I snapped a photo of two chipmunks on a snow dusted log, snowflakes falling gently past them. 

My reports to Rich and headquarters were detailed, sent via the cabin’s ancient computer. I was getting pretty damn good at Texas Hold ’Em in my downtime, I started one of my puzzles and I'm almost done with one of my books. 
though the oven’s worn knobs still baffled me, I set it and wait for it to warm up, and then cook by guesswork and pull it out before it gets to burnt. 

No more silences or ghostly visitors since that first night. I said “Hello” every time I stepped outside, entered a new area, or returned to the cabin. It was second nature now, a ritual to keep whatever haunted these woods at bay.
Things felt normal... for a while.

Then one morning, I woke late, around 10 a.m. Something was wrong. Silence. Absolute, suffocating silence. No birds, no wind, nothing.
“Maybe I’m still half asleep,” I told myself, heading to the bathroom. I peed, couldn’t hear it. Brushed my teeth, washed my face, no sound of water, no clink of the sink. It was like the woods had swallowed sound itself, just like that first night.
Had I forgotten to say “Hello” yesterday? I didn’t think so, but I wasn’t taking chances. “Hello!” I called, waiting for the woods’ sounds to return, like before. 

Nothing. No gentle “Hello” echoed back, just deafening silence. I couldn’t even hear my own voice.
Panic crept in. I threw on a pair pants, a tee shirt, and some slippers I brought, stepped outside, and yelled, “Hello!” Still nothing. 

“Oh shit, this can’t be good.” I hurried back inside, sat at the computer, and emailed the station: “Rich, Josh, you there? I just woke up and I can’t hear anything. What’s going on?”

Minutes later, Jonah replied.
""Alex, it’s Jonah. Rich and Josh are meeting with neighboring rangers about downed trees blocking some roads. I’m holding down the station. Have you been saying ‘Hello’?”

“Yes, every damn time I move or breathe! I’ve been religious about it. Are you saying it?” I typed, frustrated.

“Of course,” Jonah wrote. “Four years here, never slipped up once. I can hear fine, the station’s safe. The fence keeps it out. You sure you’ve been saying it?”

“YES, I SWEAR! If we’re all saying it, why’s this happening?”

Jonah took a while to respond. 
""It happened once before, a year ago, off-season. A homeless man wandered into the zone. Silence hit, stayed for a week. In the station it was fine, but in the zone, We couldn’t hear a thing, Police came and took him, he couldn’t speak, just stared blankly. We never learned why it lifted, but it didn’t stop until he was gone, maybe he's not even alive."" 

My stomach dropped. 
""So, someone’s out here, lost, causing this? Was he deaf or mute?”

“Probably, one or the other."" Jonah replied. “Couldn’t talk, wouldn't write, or even sign. Just stared. If someone’s in the zone who can’t say ‘Hello,’ it stirs things up."" 

""What happened to him?""
""No idea. One the police took him, we never heard more. But If you can’t hear, that has to mean someone’s out there.”

“Should I head to the station, and we search together?”

“No, I can’t leave. Rich’s orders: someone stays for radio and messages. Start at your cabin, search east toward the station, check in before heading back.”

Great. I had to find a lost person in this silent hell, alone, without hearing. Whatever was out here didn’t just want ‘Hello’—it needed it, and someone’s silence was breaking everything. 

""Okay,” I typed. “I’ll pack a few things and start east. What’s the safe code for the gun?”

Jonah hesitated. “Not allowed to give it out, unless it’s an absolute emergency.”

“THIS IS ABSOLUTE FUCKING EMERGENCY, JONAH! GIVE ME THE CODE!”

“2709. there's Shells and a bag are inside. Be safe, bring your radio. If you’re not here by nightfall, I’ll come looking.”

“I’ll do my best,” I replied.

I threw on cold-weather gear, packed food, water, an extra jacket, flashlight, batteries, and radio. I opened the safe, loaded the 12-gauge, slung the ammo bag over my shoulder, grabbed my map, and headed east. 

The silence felt heavier, like it was watching. I had 10 miles to cover before dark, hoping to find whoever was causing this and stop it, for their safety and ours.
Five miles in, around 2 p.m., I made good time despite the silence. Dark clouds rolled in, and snow fell hard, blanketing the trail. I neared a pond I’d marked, expecting it frozen, empty of animals.

I was wrong.

The massive buck I’d noted was thrashing in the pond, breaking ice, covered in blood. Around it, the bodies of his herd lay scattered, torn apart. The silence wasn’t just quiet—it was driving the woods to slaughter.
“What the hell is going on?” I thought, frozen, watching the buck’s frenzied destruction.
It turned, saw me, and charged.

1nr2r2q,https://i.redd.it/elusutg0rirf1.jpeg,Kösem Sultan (1589-1651): The regent of three sultans,"Kösem Sultan was born around 1589, likely on the Greek island of Tinos or in Bosnia, under the name Anastasia. Her childhood was far removed from the palatial splendor and political power that would later define her existence. She was brought into the Ottoman sphere through enslavement, converted to Islam, and given the name Mahpeyker (Moon-faced). Her intelligence, striking beauty, and ability to adapt to courtly life distinguished her from the multitude of concubines who entered the harem. It was these qualities that drew the attention of Sultan Ahmed I, who elevated her to the status of Haseki Sultan, his chief consort, a title that gave her both prestige and political leverage. It is also possible that the two had married but this is not for certain.

During Ahmed’s reign, Kösem carefully built her network of alliances within the palace. She bore several children, securing her role as the mother of princes and safeguarding her position in the fragile hierarchy of the imperial household. Among her children were the future sultans Murad IV and Ibrahim I, whose reigns would intertwine her destiny with the fate of the empire. Her prominence as Ahmed’s favorite allowed her to influence appointments, charitable works, and even state decisions. Ahmed I, remembered for commissioning the great Sultan Ahmed Mosque (the Blue Mosque), died young in 1617, leaving behind sons too young to inherit immediately.

Instead, the throne passed over to Ahmed's younger brother, Mustafa I, at the insistence of Kösem. This was unheard of in Ottoman politics. You see, in the previous century, the Ottoman dynasty had practiced a policy of fratricide. That is, whichever son of the previous sultan gets to seize power first, he has the right/obligation to murder his brothers in order to secure the succesion. And because the ottomans practiced polygamy, it meant there was no shortage of male offspring (for example, Ahmed's father had to murder 19 brothers when he ascended the throne). 

But when Ahmed came to the throne, he had no son that he could name as his heir, and fearing that the dynasty may die with him, decided to not kill Mustafa, but rather make him his succesor. 

But that did not last long. Barely a year after his ascension, the simple-minded Mustafa was deposed by Ahmed's eldest son, Osman II. Now Osman was not Kösem’s biological child, meaning that there was a threat to her ambitions should the new sultan try to execute his siblings. But fortunately for Kösem, he decided to spare his brothers, but kept his step-mom away from politics.

Her true ascent began in 1623, when her son Murad IV became sultan at the age of eleven, following Osman II's assasination by the janissaries. As the Valide Sultan (queen mother), Kösem was appointed regent, ruling in her son’s name. For the next decade, she acted as the empire’s de facto ruler. She issued decrees, attended the imperial council from behind a curtain, and became a central figure in the governance of one of the world’s greatest empires. This was the pinnacle of the “Sultanate of Women,” the period during which imperial mothers and consorts wielded extraordinary power. This period is considered to have started with Hürrem Sultan, the second wife of Suleiman the Maginificent.

The empire she governed through her regency was in crisis. The Ottoman state was plagued by economic decline, inflation, and military setbacks. The Janissaries, the elite corps in the Ottoman millitary, grew increasingly rebellious, and provincial uprisings undermined central authority. Kösem sought to stabilize the empire through compromise, appeasing factions, and securing loyalty through patronage. Yet, such measures came at the cost of empowering rival cliques within the palace. When Murad IV came of age and asserted control, he did so with a ferocity that surprised many. Known for his authoritarian rule, Murad banned alcohol, tobacco, and coffee, enforcing these prohibitions with brutal punishments. He led campaigns against Safavid Persia, culminating in the conquest of Baghdad in 1638, a victory that restored some prestige to the empire. Though his assumption of full authority reduced Kösem’s direct role in governance, she remained a trusted advisor, her bond with Murad unbroken until his death in 1640.

The throne then passed to her son Ibrahim I, whose reign deepened her political involvement once more. Ibrahim, remembered in history as “Ibrahim the Mad,” suffered from mental instability. His erratic behavior, indulgence in luxuries, and reliance on untrustworthy advisors left the empire vulnerable. In this environment, Kösem once again emerged as the stabilizing force. She mediated between Ibrahim and the state bureaucracy, tempered his most destructive impulses, and sought to shield the dynasty from collapse. Yet even her influence had limits. Ibrahim’s misrule alienated both the Janissaries and the religious elite, and in 1648, he was deposed and executed. Kösem is believed to have tacitly accepted or even endorsed this outcome, choosing dynastic survival over the preservation of her son’s life.

After Ibrahim’s death, his six-year-old son Mehmed IV became sultan. As the boy’s grandmother, Kösem was named Büyük Valide Sultan—“Great Queen Mother”—and once again became regent. In theory, Mehmed’s mother, Turhan Sultan, should have held the role, but the ruling elite preferred Kösem for her experience. She presided over the council, intervened in matters of state, and commanded respect from viziers and soldiers alike.

Initially, Kösem prevailed, governing effectively through appointments, financial reforms, and diplomatic initiatives. She continued her tradition of patronage, endowing mosques, charitable foundations, and soup kitchens that ensured her popularity among the people of Istanbul.

 Yet her rivalry with Turhan deepened into open factional conflict. While Kösem relied on her established networks among the palace eunuchs and Janissaries, Turhan cultivated her own supporters, eager to supplant the older queen mother.

The late 1640s and early 1650s were years of military and financial difficulty. A Venetian war over Crete strained the treasury, while defeats at sea and unrest in the capital undermined confidence in government. Kösem personally addressed protesting merchants and scolded viziers who failed to deliver results. Yet her authority was waning. 
 Tensions culminated in accusations that Kösem planned to depose Mehmed IV in favor of another grandson, one whom she could more easily control. Whether this was true or a fabrication by her rivals remains uncertain, but it provided justification for decisive action against her.

On the night of 2 September 1651, Kösem Sultan met her end. Eunuchs loyal to Turhan entered her chambers in Topkapı Palace and strangled her with a silk cord, the traditional method of execution in the Ottoman court. Thus ended the life of a woman who had dominated Ottoman politics for nearly half a century. She was buried in the mausoleum of her husband, Sultan Ahmed I, near the Blue Mosque, a fitting resting place for a woman whose life was inseparable from the fortunes of the dynasty.

Kösem’s legacy is complex and contested. To some, she was a wise and pragmatic mother of the empire, who preserved dynastic continuity through turbulent decades, safeguarded the throne for her sons and grandsons, and prevented the empire from splintering. Her charitable works, including the establishment of schools, mosques, and soup kitchens, testify to her enduring concern for the welfare of her subjects. To others, she was a manipulative schemer, driven by personal ambition, guilty of corruption, and responsible for perpetuating factionalism at the expense of stability. Contemporary chroniclers, influenced by their own loyalties, alternately vilified and glorified her, leaving historians to sift through layers of myth and bias.

What is undeniable is that Kösem Sultan was one of the most powerful women of the early modern world. In a society that officially restricted women from public political life, she ruled as regent multiple times, influenced policy, commanded loyalty from soldiers and statesmen, and outmaneuvered rivals in the perilous world of palace politics. Her life embodies both the opportunities and dangers of the Ottoman imperial system, where the harem was not merely a domestic sphere but a crucible of power.

Her death marked not only the violent end of her own career but also the gradual decline of the Sultanate of Women. Turhan Sultan would continue to exercise influence, but the era when queen mothers and consorts could dominate the empire to such an extent was drawing to a close. Yet Kösem’s name endures in history, legend, and popular imagination, remembered as both the protector of the dynasty and the ultimate palace intriguer. Her story captures the extraordinary possibilities open to a woman in the Ottoman Empire—and the perils that came with wielding power at the very heart of the sultan’s court.

I’m not here for romance or flings, just friendships built on respect, kindness, and a bit of sarcasm.

Fitness keeps me grounded—whether it’s the gym, a solid workout, or outrunning my excuses on a morning run. I also love traveling, not for the miles but for the stories (and snacks) along the way.

I especially enjoy connecting with people a little older than me—I value your experiences, perspectives, and humor.

If you’re easygoing, love good conversations, and can switch between deep talks and silly memes, let’s connect. Life’s too short for drama—let’s keep it real and fun.",0,1758896587.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,3,0.33,False

I have this whole routine down to keep me and my plants comfortable in my home. I know when and for how long to open windows, open and close curtains, and add extra humidity during the summer.
Now summer is well and truly over, my routine doesn't work anymore, and it's causing me to feel sad, uncertain, uneasy, tired, and paralysed.
It just hit me mid coffee that am really autistic. 🤣

I want the space to make sense and not completely block the entry way and ideally be a great spot for 4 people to sit and drink wine. I won’t be cooking out here just hanging out reading, having morning coffee, and hosting a few friends.

1nr2k03,https://i.redd.it/d57ux8o3mirf1.png,Thoughts on this layout,"We have an 11'x16' kitchen. We've played with a few different layouts that are more open than this one, but they all end up leaving us short on storage and counter space. The view here is from the dining room, which will be open except for the right-most \~4' being an exterior wall with a window not shown in this image. *Note the weird open corner to the right of the sink will have countertop extended fully into the corner with a blind cabinet - it's a limitation of the design tool.*

Our main concern is how the fridge divides the space, but we're hoping the idea of two work areas helps: the cooking area with the small coffee station + prep sink next to the fridge, and the main sink are by the window. It also seems like a good thing that someone can walk in from the DR and get something from the fridge without interfering with one of the work areas.

We can address the peninsula ventilation concern with a big island exhaust hood like [this](https://therangehoodstore.com/products/faber-island-canopy-range-hood-white-glass-strtis). We'll have about 30"" of countertop on either side of the stove, and 28"" of countertop from the back of the stove to the edge towards the dining room. Clearances are about 48"" from peninsula to fridge and 42"" from peninsula to 4' exterior wall (not shown)

One designer we spoke with has been generally supportive of this, and another is strongly against it - but their options are netting us much less storage and counter space, which are important to us.",1,1758896254.0,kitchenremodel,20,1.0,False
