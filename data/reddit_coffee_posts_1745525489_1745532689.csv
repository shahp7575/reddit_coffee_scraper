I‚Äôd love to start off slow and get to know someone whose interests align with mine‚Äîsomeone who‚Äôs down for impromptu getaways and finding joy in the simple moments.

Photography and motorcycling are huge parts of my life. I spend a lot of time exploring the world through a camera lens and from the seat of my bike. I dream of finding a partner who would enjoy a leisurely ride over mountain passes, soaking in the scenery, and stopping for photos of breathtaking landscapes. And if motorcycling isn‚Äôt your thing, no worries‚Äîroad trips in the car with great conversation, cozy diners, and discovering hidden gems are just as special to me.

If your idea of fun includes chasing golden-hour sunsets, savoring roadside pie, and creating unforgettable memories, let‚Äôs connect. I‚Äôm looking for someone who values shared experiences, whether it‚Äôs exploring new places or appreciating the beauty of the everyday.

Let‚Äôs take it one adventure at a time and see where the road leads us. Tell me about your favorite scenic spot or a place you‚Äôve always wanted to explore‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear about it.

More than happy to start off slow chatting online or having low-key coffee meet-ups as we get to know each other better.

1k74v54,https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/1k74v54/cannot_believe_how_horrible_it_is_to_move_apps/,Cannot believe how horrible it is to move apps and widgets around on iPad Pro M4,"This is the first time I‚Äôve had an iPad since the iPad mini two ‚Ä¶ so yeah it‚Äôs been a minute got my iPad Pro M4 (2024) 512 GB version two weeks ago .. display is beautiful and the multitasking features are fun since I‚Äôve never got to experience them ever before. Also excited to hook it up to my Samsung ultra wide and try out that experience as well. But seriously just rearranging the app icons is such a chore way easier on iPhone - not just because the screen is smaller because on iPhone you can tap the screen to hold it in place and then with your other finger grab the app and place it where you want. Am I missing something or does this just not work on iPad? Every time I move an app or widget all of the icons move straight to the top down wherever not where I want them. Of course placing an icon anywhere on the screen was added to iOS 18 and it looks like it‚Äôs an iPadOS 18 as well but it‚Äôs just horrible. Other positives is the design love love love how thin it is it‚Äôs truly a beautiful piece of hardware. Overall performance is great and it‚Äôs fun to play around in the apps. Apple widgets are optimized for iPad more than ever before and again they look beautiful on that OLED display. However, more things I don‚Äôt like keyboard is horrible wish you could swipe to type and it‚Äôs just outdated, I love using wedgy but you cannot stack apps on top of each other like you can on iPhone do not understand this at all you can stack any other widget besides customizable widgets from these types of apps. Performance has already dipped a bit on 18.4.1 wish I would‚Äôve just stayed on 18.4 like I‚Äôm currently using on my 15 Pro Max. I‚Äôve had random resprings a few times which is disappointing to see on a brand new device. Shout out to chrome for iPad it‚Äôs amazing with the multiple tabs I just wish Google would truly bring dark mode to chrome like they have for the Google app also waiting for a Gemini iPad hopefully that is in the works. Love getting a phone call or FaceTime on my iPhone and it seamlessly transferring to my iPad - using Q widgets to control your lights as a joy. Last thing I can think of right now - really wish there was an Apple TV remote app built-in or widget instead of just the icons in control center which leads me to control center kind of crazy how it‚Äôs on the top right of the screen and literally the rest of the 13 inch display is wasted and not available for use. If they don‚Äôt want to make control center bigger just make it a drop-down that overlays on your regular home screen in that tiny window of faded transparency without the overlay just like it is on macOS - OK I thought of a couple more things lol I wish there was more apps optimized for iPad I feel like they are sincerely lacking for whatever reason or maybe they‚Äôre just not promoted enough in the App Store like I want to see only iPad apps front and center when using the iPad App Store it should always optimize to show me them first not iPhone apps that are popular that are in no way optimized for iPad still in 2025 - don‚Äôt understand how Apple Intelligence doesn‚Äôt include AI upscaling or resizing of apps in scenario this seems like a no-brainer. OK back to a positive speakers are amazing they get so loud you can hear them from literally rooms away. My favorite thing is of course watching YouTube all day every day putting it on a coffee table while you have your TV on. Chrome tabs while your multitasking or taking notes is truly a wonderful experience do not have an Apple Pencil yet or a wireless charging stand but I plan to get them eventually. Last complaint maybe this is again a bug with 18.4.1 but again customizing your home screen or even changing your wallpaper from the lock screen is very tedious I know it‚Äôs similar on iPhone but it‚Äôs just not as horrible - I hate how simply changing a few things makes you start completely over with a whole new spread of widgets clock on the lock screen etc. Also the default black shiny wallpaper that the iPad came with custom clock is broken which sucks because it‚Äôs actually something different that we don‚Äôt have on iOS so yeah to wrap this up my biggest complaint is customizing the iPad it should be easier to customize the iPad than the iPhone but somehow the iPhone is well still limited compared to android and Windows feels more unique and you have more options to make it your own. Biggest strength of iPad is the beautiful OLED display I mean seriously it‚Äôs gorgeous forgot to mention battery life that‚Äôs been pretty solid too except when playing high-powered games but I will not do that often just wanted to test a few of the most graphically intense ones when I first got it - time will tell if I use this iPad to do actual work/creative hobbies more in the future. Please recommend any apps widgets accessories tips tricks for your opinions on the best things and worse things about the iPad Pro M4!

* UI elements not appearing despite the code executing 
* Dropdown menus (ComboBox) showing empty when debug confirms data exists
* General Resolve-Fusion quirks that go over my head

I wanted to ask if this has ever happened to anyone here.

I‚Äôve been having migraine auras followed by headaches for years, about once every couple of months. I get headaches more often, but auras are less frequent.

Today something a bit different happened:

I woke up already feeling a little off. A few hours later, I had a coffee, and within minutes, a migraine aura started ‚Äî pretty normal for me so far. I lay down to wait it out and ended up almost falling asleep. I woke up as the aura was ending, but I noticed my vision still wasn‚Äôt quite right. Then, almost immediately, another aura began. This really scared me and I almost went to the ER, but eventually it passed and now I just have the usual headache.

Has anyone here ever experienced two consecutive auras? Could it be that partially falling asleep disrupted or ‚Äúrestarted‚Äù the aura?

jay would be the dark chocolate ganache layer, because his voice is recognizable & powerful.

sunoo would be the white chocolate ganache layer because his tone is always very sweet and he adds the hint of sugar enhypen songs always have. 

sunghoon would fr be the cream cheese frosting  ontop and on the sides of the cake with intricate patterns. his voice is very rich and delicate. 

jake would be the fresh assorted fruit toppings covering the circumfrence of the cake. he always adds that freshness to their songs, and you feel refreshed listening to his song cover too.

jungwon would definitely be the coconut shavings on the cake and the sides. he wraps everything together and coconut offers a new complex flavor. 

ni-ki would be a coffee sauce drizzle. earthy, dark but a hint of sweetness. if you think hard enough, that sweetness was there all along.

1k74kqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthAmericanPantheon/comments/1k74kqh/doctor_tobias_office_drama_day/,"Doctor Tobias' ""Office Drama"" day!","The day started off just like any other in our lovely pantheon. I began mine with a cup of coffee to be enjoyed while watching the permitted news on my little TV on the wall, reading through a file on a patient I'd be seeing later. I had high hopes for the day to come as I only had a handful of scheduled meetings, and would be done in time for lunch in the cafeteria with the others for a change.

My first 3 appointments went by without incident. I had gifted Charlie a new extra thick notepad and pen set that he had been needing, as his last set was nearly depleted. I gave Numa a gentle snow storm in his cell, his joy was contagious. And finally, I'd met with Catalin, all he wanted was someone to talk to. I was happy to oblige. 

At 11am my next patient on the books was Merry, which was unusual. Merry had always avoided our mandated appointments for one reason or another, but this was a personally scheduled appointment assigned by Director Bitch himself. The note only said ""if he doesn't show, find him. He needs something from someone before he implodes."" As I finished reading that note, as if summoned by my thinking about him, Merry busted through the door with a loud and exaggerated sigh. 

""Hey doc! I was told you wanted to see me? Sorry I havent talked to you in a while, things have been so busy with all this work Director Bitch has been requiring from me."" He flashed me a toothy grin as he came in and sat across from me at the desk. 

I gave him a small smile back. ""It's quite alright, Merrick. No harm done. I had a question for you. I've been told you've been needing something, do you happen to know what it is you have been needing?"" I asked him as compassionately as I could muster. 

""Um, well, no I don't."" He furrowed his brow, ""I'm pretty content where I am. I would like some more down time, and to be less stressed with Rachele and Christophe's chaotic situation. But beyond that I'm not needing anything specifically."" His tone was more confused than anything, I can only assume he expected this to be for different reasons. 

""Okay. Well how about this... Would you like to join me for the rest of the day? Arlo will approve the relequishment of your duties, while we just have a bit of a fun day. He did say anything you want within my capabilities you could have, and this is surely something I am capable of giving you."" I offered him a reassuring smile. ""I have a bit of a... Side quest I wanted to accomplish, and I could use your help.""

""A side quest? That sounds like fun. I'm in. What are we doing doc? Planting flowers or planning a heist?"" He hopped up from his seat to look around my space, which admittedly *was* full of potted plants, far too many to a normal person, but just the right amount for me. 

""I was actually thinking of socializing with our other inmate friends."" I said tentatively, a soft nervous chuckle escaping my lips. 

""Socializing? You? That's a twist."" He visibly held in a laugh. ""Let's do it, I don't think I've ever seen you leave this room for anything except an appointment."" He sauntered over to me and grabbed my sleeve. Before I could protest the unexpected contact he yanked me forward and up, nearly dragging me out of the door into the hall. 

Before I knew it we were halfway down the hallway. As we turned the corner Merry stopped. ""Perfect place to start!"" He picked up his pace pulling me along with him, with my focus on keeping my feet steady, I hadn't realize who was standing in front of us by the time we stopped. 

Klaudiya stood there, smiling her beautifully uncanny smile. ""Hi Merry, Hi Doctor Tobias! What are you boys up to?""

I returned her smile with one of my own, far too wide for the occasion, my awkward stature exuding my nervousness. Before I could formulate an answer, Merry piped up. 

""We're socializing! I figured you would be the perfect place for Doctor Shut In here to start.""

""You think so? That's sweet."" Her smile grew wider, melting my heart further. She switched her attention from Merry to me. I froze. ""How has your day been, Doctor?""

""Its.. um.. it's been good."" I stammered out, my nerves getting the best of me. Merry nudged me closer to her and released my sleeve. I caught myself just before falling into her. My cheeks flushed, watching her eyes search my face in an attempt to read me. ""I uh.. how has yours been?""

""It has been very good, Nicole made me a delicious ice cream cake earlier, would you like to share some with me?"" She looked between Merry and I, joy still plastered on her face. 

I started to reply on instinct with, ""Oh, no I couldnt-"" but Merry cut me off. 

""Birdy says this is a lie. We would love some Klaudiya. Lead the way!"" 

I gave him a bit of a glare as she sauntered off down the hall, us following close behind. I mouthed the words 'why are you torturing me' and he decided to reply fairly loudly. 

""Everyone knows you like her, dude. It's not hard to notice how you act."" He laughed a bit too much. I blushed and picked up my pace in a futile attempt to escape him for a moment. 

Once reaching the cafeteria, Klaudiya motioned for us to sit at the table, while she went to get the cake. I took my chair in the corner and settled in. Merry plopped down in his beside me, leaning over a little too close. 

""You should totally ask her out."" He pestered, smiling in a way that to anyone else would suggest he meant more than what he said. 

""I don't know about that... I would not make the greatest partner, and she deserves that more than anything."" I sighed, unsure why I was opening up so much to him.

""Don't be silly, you could give her everything she wants, and you're a sweet guy. I'd date you if you were interested."" He chuckled. 

Almost if on cue, Klaudiya returned with the cake, and Nicole. 

""Hi Merry! Hi Doc! What's up?"" Nicole beamed cheerily as she sat down across from Merry, while Klaudiya was getting slices on plates. 

""Hi Nicole, how've you been?"" I offered her a friendly smile, shifting my eyes between her and watching Klaudiya. 

""I've been well! It's good to see you out of your office. We dont get a lot of time with you unprofessionally."" She laughed a bit, and took a plate from the line up. 

""I love cake"" Merry exclaimed as he snatched another plate quickly, digging in as if he was starving. 

""Slow down, Merry. You don't want to get a brain freeze!"" Klaudiya laughed and handed me my plate. As I took it, our fingers brushed against one another, and I blushed. The butterflies in my stomach and the lump in my throat growing fiercely. 

""Thank you, Klaudiya."" I managed to say just above a whisper, as she took her plate and sat down. 

""You're welcome, Doctor. You seem nervous today. Is everything okay?"" She raised her brow, a teasing smile on her face, as if she could read my mind, and knew what I really wanted to ask her. 

""Yeah! Yeah I'm good. I just... I just don't get out much. It's easier to be social with people as patients than it is as friends."" I broke eye contact and started picking at my cake slice, taking a small bite. ""This is really good, Nicole. You did a great job!"" I offered her a smile before looking back to Klaudiya to see her staring at me, in a manner that made me squirm in my seat. 

Merry piped up ""yeah this is amazing! Can Birdy have some too?""

""Sure!"" Klaudiya happily cut another piece of the ice cream cake and pushed the plate to Merry. Merry happily fed his little invisible friend. To us, it just looked like the cake was disappearing mid air. If it wasn't such a common occurrence, I would have been disturbed. 

""So Klaudiya. Our Good Doctor here has been just *dying* to ask you something."" Merry said dramatically, casually feeding the bird. 

""What? No I don't I-"" I stammered quickly before being cut off. 

""Yes you do. You've been staring at her since the moment you met, it's time to do something about it. Either you ask, or I ask for you. You're not weaseling out of it."" He gave me a serious look with his eyes, but a mischievous smile accompanied. ""Now ask her.""

I sighed and looked back to Klaudiya. Her solid black eyes shined brightly, so full of life despite their lack colour. ""I um...""

""Well go on, we haven't got all morning, mister"" Nicole chimed in, laughing softly to herself. 

I took in a deep breath, looking between my plate and Klaudiya. I finally met her eyes again. ""I um... Have been wondering if... Maybe one of these days we could get together, for dinner or something? A little...""

""A DATE! He's asking if you want to go on a date with him! Good lord man spit it out!"" Merry yelled and patted me hard on the back. I ignored him to the best of my abilities. 

""I think that would be lovely, Tobias. Does Saturday work for you?"" Klaudiya smiled casually, a slight of blush flushing her cheeks in colour. 

""Y-yes absolutely that works perfectly."" I returned her smile, shifting in my seat out of anxiousness. 

""Alright suckers Im going to see what the buffet has. Would you like to join me, m'lady?"" Merry stood, offing his arm to Nicole with a friendly smile. She laughed and wrapped her arm through his, and they sauntered off into the distance. 

As soon as they were out of ear shot, I mumbled to Klaudiya. ""I am so sorry about that. I told him I needed to socialize and he ran with it.""

""You don't need to apologize, Tobias. I have kind of been waiting for that question from you for a while."" She giggled, the sound was like music to my ears. ""I'm just glad you finally asked.""

""Me too."" I smiled. I admired her features for a long moment, before standing and beginning to put the cake away. I packed it up and slid it over to her. She stood, grabbing the tupperware and sliding it across the table back in front of me. She stood closer to me than she ever had. It made me nervous in the best possible way. ""I think I am going to head back to my room, but I'll come by yours and grab you at 7 on Saturday. Does that sound good?""

She smiled widely. ""It does."" She reached to me and before I knew it she had wrapped her arms around my neck, pulling me into a hug. I hesitated briefly before embracing her back. We stayed like this for a moment too long. Right before she pulled away from our hug, she placed a gentle, cold kiss on my cheek. I blushed bright red. ""I'll see you around, Tobias. I am excited for Saturday.""

""Me too."" I nearly whispered. I watched as she walked away, smiling like an idiot. Once she was out of sight I looked around for Merry and Nicole. I didn't see them around the cafeteria, and decided to make the trek back to my room. 

When I got there, I settled into my couch, letting out a sigh of relief. Thinking to myself just what to make for her. It will be interesting for sure. I just hope I can make it perfect.",2,1745531744.0,NorthAmericanPantheon,0,1.0,False
1k74knt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k74knt/how_to_handle_a_thieving_housemate/,How to handle a thieving housemate?,"I (22f) have been with my partner (25m) for two years, and live with him for most of the time (Im a student with my own housing, I just like spending time with him and he's too tall to fit in the bed at my place because of the footboard). Partner is medically signed off and lives in shared housing. Most of his housemates are fine, I'm friendly with some, others i don't really see aside from a polite hello when we pass in the hallways, but there's one particular housemate, 'L', that has repeatedly stolen from my partner. It started with our coffee running out faster than usual, and then also our sugar. It pretty quickly advanced to food going missing: like if we ordered pizza and I put my leftovers in the fridge, by the time I got to it the next morning it would be missing 2-3 slices. This guy has stolen plates, bowls, mugs, cutlery, anything that isn't locked away or bolted down, essentially.

L is kind of rough, he has an aggressive criminal record, has been caught doing said crimes on camera several times so doesn't care about being sneaky (meaning cameras won't be any use here) and is known to use some pretty hard drugs, so any head on confrontation is out of the question. The kitchen is shared & partner has limited space so getting a mini fridge is also unachievable.

Partner has spoken to his landlords about getting L moved into one of the rooms downstairs (so he wouldn't be sharing a kitchen with my partner) but they're notoriously useless and said ""Yeah we'll sort it""‚Äî a year and a half ago.

Partner is at his wits end. Ive suggested we stay at my place but my lease ends in a few months (we're looking at getting a place together but renting us crazy expensive where we are so we've gotta save up first) so by the time we'd moved the stuff we need ‚Äî clothes, food, tech, etc ‚Äî we'd have to move it all back again.

Anyone got any advice on how to stop a  thieving housemate?

1k74kgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k74kgf/can_the_shardor_10cup_programmable_coffee_maker/,Can the SHARDOR 10-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker Review Transform Your Morning Routine?,"Testing out the SHARDOR 10-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, model B0DLK75SZJ, has been quite an adventure in my kitchen. I‚Äôve used many coffee makers over the years, but this machine struck me as a blend of modern flair and practical functionality. It‚Äôs marketed as a programmable drip coffee machine aimed at both home and office setups, and I gave it a thorough spin to see how it fares in real life. Spoiler alert: it left me both satisfied and occasionally scratching my head.

**Stylish Design with Thoughtful Features**  
Right out of the box, the sleek silver design of this coffee maker caught my attention. Its compact dimensions of 8"" x 6.7"" x 12.7"" make it a great fit for smaller countertops without compromising on capacity. The modern styling is complemented by the LCD touchscreen, which feels responsive and intuitive to use. Setting this machine up was straightforward, though I did have to squint at the manual once or twice to figure out some lesser-used settings. The reusable filter was a nice touch; it feels environmentally friendly and cuts down on the hassle of buying paper filters.

**Easy Programmability for Busy Mornings**  
This machine really shines with its 24-hour programmable brew timer. Every morning, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee greets me right on schedule. The timer was simple to program, and as someone perpetually running late for work, I appreciated the reliability. It even allows you to customize your coffee brew strength, offering two brewing options: regular and strong. I tried both settings and loved how my coffee felt personalized depending on the mood of the day. Still, those who like their coffee scorchingly strong might not find the ‚Äústrong‚Äù option quite intense enough.

**Warm Coffee Anytime You Need It**  
One of my favorite aspects is the warming plate, which keeps coffee hot for up to two hours. From my experience, it consistently maintained a pleasing temperature without giving that scorched flavor some machines impart the longer coffee sits there. It‚Äôs a lifesaver on chaotic mornings when I‚Äôm juggling other tasks and forget my cup on the counter (which happens far too often). The auto shut-off feature further adds peace of mind; no more second-guessing whether I turned off the coffee maker after leaving the house.

**Sneak-a-Cup Functionality**  
I enjoyed the clever pause-and-serve function that lets me grab a cup mid-brew without creating a drippy mess. To test it, I impatiently poured a cup halfway through the brewing process. True to its claim, there was no mess, and when I replaced the carafe, the brewing continued seamlessly. It‚Äôs small things like this that add value to daily coffee routines.

**Good Aspects**  
- Compact and stylish design that fits well on any countertop.  
- Intuitive LCD touchscreen interface simplifies usage.  
- Programmable timer ensures coffee is ready when you need it.  
- Warming plate keeps coffee warm for two hours without burning it.  
- Reusable filter reduces waste and long-term costs.

**Critiques**  
- The ‚Äústrong‚Äù brew option may not satisfy hardcore coffee enthusiasts.  
- Operation could be noisier than anticipated, especially before the brewing cycle finishes.  
- The carafe could have a sturdier feel; who else worries about accidental drops?

**Competing Products Comparison**  
How does this programmable coffee maker stack up against others in its category? Compared to the ever-popular Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, this model has a more modern touchscreen interface, which definitely feels like an upgrade. However, the Mr. Coffee machine offers a slightly larger capacity and a more robust strong-brew setting, which might appeal to larger households or strong coffee drinkers. On the other hand, the SHARDOR machine‚Äôs reusable filter and pause-and-serve feature edged out that competitor in my book. Keurig‚Äôs K-Duo coffee maker, which supports both a carafe and K-cups, also stands as a solid rival. While Keurig brings the versatility of single-serve pods, the SHARDOR‚Äôs eco-friendly brewing system and ease of mid-brew coffee wins points.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
You might wonder if this machine is worth its price tag, particularly when there are so many competitors in the market for similar coffee makers. Based on my experience, it provides excellent value for those who treasure the programmable feature and mid-brew customization. The reusable filter is a game-changer for those trying to save on disposable filter costs, and the two-hour warming plate adds unmatched convenience. If you‚Äôre someone who prefers a smart, stylish coffee maker that caters to your brew timing and strength preferences, this machine‚Äôs value proposition appears strong against its competitors. However, if you‚Äôre on the hunt for ultra-quiet brewing or the richest strong-brew capabilities, it might not fully meet those expectations.

I am super happy with my family life that I didn‚Äôt feel like I need another person. Ive had many friends before my marriage and everything ended in huge dramas so..
Then after a while I started to feel a bit lonely, I wanted some female companionship. 

I just wanted to go for a coffee and chitchat. 

I started to look for friends, found a woman who I met for a coffee and it was pretty good. She seems my type, we met once a again for dinner, that‚Äôs it. 

After a month or two, she texted me, asking if I knew anyone who plays badminton. I said yeah me..she said oh cool, let‚Äôs go play then. I said sure, she texted me 9am, and asked me to meet her at 10 am. I asked her where, she had no idea. I couldn‚Äôt go that day because I had already planned to meet another friend of mine. 

This offended her a little as she said ‚ÄúI ditched her for a friend‚Äù 

I ignored it, and moved on. Then she texts me asking to find a place to play and she wants to learn badminton too. I was really frustrated because she was the one approaching me about it and then she wants me to research about it. 
I thought okay fine it‚Äôs my first friend, Ill research. I sent her 3-4 places and none of it worked for her, as the time didn‚Äôt match, location didn‚Äôt match. She doesn‚Äôt want anything I suggest nor she wants to find herself. 

She can‚Äôt go anytime after 8pm as her schedule will be affected, she is only free after 6:30pm. 
I am not free at 6:30 pm as we follow a routine. However I am free after 8pm because that‚Äôs when Ill be done with dinner. 

I told her this and she flipped off. 
She kept telling me how I am so busy and wanting to play badminton, how I am a busy girl, how I am worried about my routine change, how I am not making sacrifices for plans. 
She was a bit harsh too, as she said ‚Äúshe can‚Äôt change her routine but wants to play badminton‚Äù

I was stunned. I wanted a friendship for some peace and now I am listening to some woman yelling at me? 
In my mind, I felt I should‚Äôve just minded my own business and be happy with my married life rather than go in search for friendship.. 

I guess that‚Äôs the end of it, I just didn‚Äôt text her after that. I don‚Äôt really wanna be friends with people who has so much audacity. ",2,1745531707.0,AskIndianWomen,0,1.0,False

1k74j67,https://i.redd.it/56qp8x7iluwe1.png,My Version Of Humanized Titanic (I'm going to do the other two as well so don't worry),"Note: This is from my universe okay so none of this is real....kinda (the bio of her sinking and shit like that) So this is my version and this shouldn't be taken seriously.

**Character Profile: RMS Titanic (Human Form)**

* **Full Name:**¬†RMS Titanic (Currently goes by ""Titanic"" or a chosen human name, though the prompt doesn't specify one. ""Titanic"" serves as her primary identifier.)
* **Nicknames:**¬†Ship of Dreams, Unsinkable (Ironically, due to her history), Dreamweaver (given by Olympic), Nightfall Queen (given by Britannic). In her human form, people might simply call her ""Titanic"" or use a chosen human name.
* **Age:**¬†113 years old (Chronological), Appears 17 (Human Form)
* **Birthday:**¬†May 31, 1911
* **Species:**¬†Reincarnated Human (Originally a Ship/Ocean Liner)
* **Sexuality:**¬†Bisexual

**Appearance:**

Titanic manifests as a youthful, 17-year-old Caucasian girl.

* **Eyes:**¬†Striking cyan.
* **Hair:**¬†A distinctive combination of vibrant orange hair with contrasting black bangs.
* **Scars & Marks:**¬†Bears a permanent scar etched across her face, a lingering mark from her fatal collision with the iceberg. She also has a heart-shaped mole, a nod to the famous ""Heart of the Ocean"" necklace from her cinematic portrayal.
* **Clothing:**¬†Primarily seen in a simple Japanese school girl outfit. This choice of attire is a direct result of her tragic sinking, which left her with little to no material possessions in her new human life and is the most affordable clothing she could obtain.
* **Accessories:**¬†She wears a simple pearl necklace, rectangle glasses, star hair clips, light blue headband, and proudly displays a bisexual badge.

**Personality:**

Titanic is characterized by a blend of gentle and vulnerable traits. She is inherently Shy, often hesitant in new social situations, but also deeply Generous and Friendly once she feels comfortable. Her past trauma has instilled in her a Cowardly streak, particularly concerning triggers related to her sinking. Despite her fears, she is Peaceful and strives to avoid conflict. She is Polite, Reliable, and possesses a Highly Creative and Imaginative mind, often expressing herself through various hobbies. At times, a Childish innocence surfaces, perhaps reflecting her relatively short ""first life"" and the overwhelming nature of her experiences.

**History & Background:**

Originally the magnificent RMS Titanic, a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line, she was heralded as ""unsinkable"" ‚Äì a designation tragically disproven on her maiden voyage on April 14, 1912. Her collision with an iceberg in the North Atlantic led to one of history's most devastating maritime disasters, with over 1,500 lives lost, compounded by an insufficient number of lifeboats despite her innovative and luxurious design. Her wreck was located in 1985, resting deep beneath the ocean surface.

In 2022, Titanic was reincarnated into a human form, given a second chance at life. Stripped of her former grandeur and wealth due to the disaster, she finds herself in a new, unfamiliar world. She is eager to experience modern life, exploring both her old hobbies in her new form (singing, dancing, playing instruments) and discovering new ones like video games and social media. Her sisters have also taken new forms: Britannic works in a hospital, while Olympic has tragically become a criminal following her and Britannic's death.

**Relationships:**

* **RMS Olympic:**¬†Her older sister. The relationship is currently strained, bordering on antagonistic, ever since Olympic ""snapped"" following Britannic's death. Titanic's primary goal is to stop Olympic.
* **HMHS Britannic:**¬†Her younger sister. Their relationship is complex; sometimes positive, sometimes strained (""sometimes"" dislike), reflecting the difficulties and changes they've all undergone.
* **Friends:**¬†Values being with friends, finding comfort and enjoyment in their company.

**Mental & Emotional State:**

Titanic carries significant emotional and psychological burdens from her past life. She suffers from¬†**PTSD**,¬†**Panic Disorder**,¬†**Anxiety Disorder**¬†(both Social and Generalized),¬†**Agoraphobia**¬†(fear of open or crowded spaces, likely related to her sinking and potentially large crowds), and¬†**Severe Depression**. These conditions heavily impact her daily life, making large groups and situations reminiscent of her trauma particularly difficult. Her dislikes are often tied directly to these disorders and her past.

**Likes:**

Seashells, ice coffee, being remembered positively by others, making flower crowns, candle making, bird watching, reading (fiction and non-fiction), cake decorating, meadows, fireplaces, sewing, knitting, playing chess, relaxing at spas (massages, facials, manicures, pedicures, etc.), being with friends.¬†*Formerly*¬†liked Olympic,¬†*sometimes*¬†likes Britannic.

**Dislikes:**

Olympic (due to her current criminal state),¬†*sometimes*¬†dislikes Britannic, the beach (possibly due to sand and proximity to the ocean), her past, icebergs, winter, snow, blizzards (all strong reminders of her sinking), body piercings, math, quilting, experiencing panic and anxiety attacks, being in large groups, most divers visiting her wreck (feeling invaded or disturbed,¬†*except*¬†for Robert Ballard who found her not only by accident, but respectfully), sand castles (possibly related to the beach/ocean dislike), and most profoundly, death.

**Skills & Talents:**

Despite her human form, she retains impressive talents from her previous existence or has re-learned them:

* Playing the piano and organ
* Dance
* Gymnastics
* Singing
* Playing the Violin

**Goals & Motivation:**

In her new human life, Titanic's overarching goal is twofold:

1. To explore and experience the modern world, engaging with both her former passions and new discoveries, trying to build a life away from the tragedy.
2. To confront and stop her older sister, Olympic, before Olympic's criminal actions cause further harm, potentially seeking to protect others and perhaps even Olympic from herself. This mission adds a layer of urgency and danger to her new existence.",0,1745531630.0,titanic,0,0.2,False

Just finished a two week vacation in Costa Rica and had a great time. I thought I would mention what we found useful on our trip and some items we should have brought. While many of these suggestions can be found in various posts, these were specific to us. This is not a list of common things to bring such as rain gear, sunscreen, water shoes, etc.

For context, most of our activities were adventure related ‚Äì ATV‚Äôs, kayaking, jet skiing, and tons of rugged hiking. We visited in mid-April. Stayed in 4 (maybe 5?) airbnb's.

**Things we regret bringing**

* Jeans ‚Äì We thought there might be a cold evening or a restaurant that would require something like a dark jean. Should have brought one pair of lightweight kaki‚Äôs or travel pants instead. We had 5 pairs of jeans for the 3 of us.
* Bug Spray ‚Äì Maybe it was the time of year, but we had no issues with bugs in the ranch-like countryside, jungle, or beach.

**Things we were glad we brought**

* Microfiber camp towel ‚Äì Lightweight, compact (size of an eyeglass case), fast-drying. Sorry if this sounds like an infomercial, but we used these towels quite frequently.
* Hiking boots ‚Äì I was reluctant to bring my waterproof, stiff soled hiking boots because of the size. I figured sneakers would be fine. In the end, I brought them and was so glad I did. We walked very rocky, muddy, and wet trails. My feet were happy the whole time.
* Backup charger/battery ‚Äì Relied heavily on phone navigation. That combined with pictures and video, our phones drained before the day ended.

**Things I wish we had brought**

* Fast drying clothing ‚Äì Although we brought polyester swim shirts and a couple shorts made out of man-made fibers, we brought a lot of cotton shorts and tee shirts. We felt wet all the time when wearing cotton clothing. Most of our accommodations had washing machines but no dryers. Our cotton clothing never dried on the line in humid jungle environments. Go figure.
* Compact grocery bag ‚Äì I have a compact polyester bag that folds to nothing. I forgot to bring it.
* Waterproof phone case ‚Äì Forgot to bring. Used Ziploc bags but not the same
* Laundry bag ‚Äì We usually use a trash bag, but none of our accommodations had spare trash bags!
* Pour over cup ‚Äì Most of our accommodations had coffee makers, but not all had filters. Wish I had brought my collapsible camp pour over cup.

1k74cjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wattpad/comments/1k74cjm/daily_writing_advice/,Daily Writing Advice,"As a writer and an active member on this sub, I've come across the same asked questions. So I decided to give you some advice I have based on research I've done. 

This advice is for those who are struggling with writer's burnout.



**Writers burnout.**

What is it?

To put it simply, burnout is a state of physical, emotional and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged stress related to writing. (Thank you, Google)

When you're burned out, you often feel ***unmotivated***, ***not as creative, and your enthusiasm for writing dies down.*** While in burnout, you'll often think that ***writing isn't your thing anymore, and begin to think of quitting writing altogether***. (Sound familiar?) 

Some things that can cause burnout are

‚Ä¢Tight deadlines  
‚Ä¢Pressure to produce  
‚Ä¢Self-Doubt  
‚Ä¢Lack of work-life balance  
‚Ä¢Isolation  
‚Ä¢Perfectionism  
‚Ä¢Unclear goals  
‚Ä¢Repetitive Tasks  
‚Ä¢Lack of support  
‚Ä¢Inadequate Resources  
‚Ä¢Overcommitment  
‚Ä¢Emotional Exhaustion

In short, there are so many things that can cause someone to burn out. Burnout happens to all writers. It's very common, and it can be¬†***cured***!

It's a simple fix. Some things that can fix writer's burnout are

***1: Taking breaks***  
‚Ä¢Regularly step away from writing to recharge, even if it's for a short period.

***2: Set boundaries***  
‚Ä¢Limit writing hours and prioritize personal time to maintain a healthy balance.

***3: Reconnect with passion***  
‚Ä¢Engage with writing projects that excite you or explore new genres to rekindle creativity.

***4: Seek Support***  
‚Ä¢Talk to fellow writers, friends, or a mentor about your feelings to gain perspective and encouragement.

***5: Practice self-care***  
‚Ä¢Focus on physical health through exercise, nutrition, and proper sleep.

***6: Change your environment***  
‚Ä¢Sometimes, if you stay in one place while writing, it can cause you to feel stressed, so changing your environment where you write can help. (I go to a coffee shop every day, and it's helped me write)

***7: Professional help***  
‚Ä¢Sometimes you might need to talk to a professional, like a therapist or a counsellor, to help. Or if you don't want to talk to either, turn to a friend.   


Burnout isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's a sign that your body is taking too much stress on and needs to relax a bit.

It arrived a few days ago, and I was too excited to wait. I unpacked it, gave it a quick rinse, filled the water tank, added beans, and hit brew. I didn‚Äôt read the manual because, hey, how hard could it be to make espresso, right?  
  
Turns out, pretty hard when you forget to install the drip tray and didn‚Äôt lock in the portafilter correctly. The machine made a loud sputtering sound, then water and hot coffee started spraying everywhere. Like a crime scene. I scrambled to stop it, but the water tank had already dumped a good portion of its contents across my counter and floor. I now know what a $700 panic attack smells like: burnt beans and shame.  
  
Had to spend an hour cleaning up what was supposed to be a 3-minute coffee fix. And yes, I finally sat down and read the manual, after using about half a roll of paper towels and narrowly missing electrocuting myself.  
  
TL;DR: Bought a fancy espresso machine after a bit of extra cash came through, didn‚Äôt read the instructions, and accidentally flooded my kitchen with high-pressure coffee chaos. I am not, in fact, a barista.",17,1745531106.0,tifu,2,0.87,False
1k74c3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1k74c3y/baked_dairy_does_anyone_else_get_triggered/,Baked dairy? Does anyone else get triggered?,"Hi! So I wanted to ask if anyone else had issues and triggers with dairy even if it‚Äôs baked. I know it‚Äôs possible, but is it common? 

For context I don‚Äôt eat lactose, i‚Äôm trying to find alternatives for LF milk and cream cheese and stuff, but i don‚Äôt really like almond milk and idk how i feel about oat milk‚Ä¶it‚Äôs ok in coffee but i don‚Äôt drink it anymore, i think it would be too heavy. I eat butter, but even too much of that makes me die. I think most of this is due to the fat (my gallbladder DEFINITELY needs to come out at some point, long lines of women in my family with gallbladder issues). I also have IBS or some kind of stomach issue (as we all know, IBS is a BS diagnosis) so that doesn‚Äôt help.  My main triggers are coffee, high fiber fruits/foods, and dairy. And fried/fatty foods. 

Enough yapping I know i can‚Äôt have dairy but, like most ppl who can‚Äôt have dairy, i tend to say fuck it even tho i know i shouldn‚Äôt. Ive been messing around with baked in dairy. Cake (with no frosting) and other stuff. Today at work i fucked around and had three mini cupcakes (with no icing) cuz my coworkers last day was today. Well, I found out when i got home, paid the price for it. I know what i ate that set me off (or I THINK i do‚Ä¶my stomach plays games with me sometimes) because the rest of the week i‚Äôve had pound cake and muffins and stuff with baked dairy followed by an upset stomach. 

So what im asking here is that is it common for all dairy, even baked dairy to be a trigger? Also plz give me dairy free replacement recs that are good for someone with a low fiber diet‚Ä¶

(Also before the comments flood in‚Ä¶i did the low fodmap stuff. Gluten is not a trigger, sugar isn‚Äôt a trigger, fructans in themself aren‚Äôt a trigger‚Ä¶just dairy‚Ä¶and i think it‚Äôs mainly the fat. Just high fiber foods)

Wondering if anyone else here is allergic to it? It doesn't seem very common. I'm kind of worried about my ability to avoid it entirely, especially since I work in a coffee shop and I'm probably breathing it in any time I add it to someone's latte.

If anyone else IS allergic I'd love to know what your experience has been like, or any good spice combos to substitute for it!

Do you realize that you left something rare, something that you will most likely never find again? If so at what point post breakup? At what point into no contact?

The reason I ask, tomorrow will be three months since my girlfriend broke with me. We had a wonderful year relationship that quickly went downhill in two weeks. I‚Äôm feeling far better, and can look at things with a clear head ( and without crying ). One fact remains, I want her back more than anything, and continue to take steps for myself and for that little glimmer of hope. 

Now I see people do a back and forth here and other breakup related subreddits. ‚ÄúMy relationship was unique‚Äù and ‚Äúyour relationship isn‚Äôt anything special‚Äù. I get where both of these thoughts come from, that being said this was truly unique and rare. I met my ex on a dating app, and we immediately hit it off. Our first date we got coffee and we spoke until the place closed, we then left and got pizza and continued to talk. We have so much in common it was almost like looking into a mirror. We like the same old movies, the same old television shows, her mother and my father grew up in the same neighborhood in Brooklyn, we had the interests and views, the same goals for the future. I can go on and on, pretty much the more we spoke the more I thought ‚Äúthis is meant to be‚Äù. The one aspect that was different was she didn‚Äôt travel much, I saw this as an opportunity as I like to travel. I don‚Äôt mean to sound egotistical, but I opened up her world and introduced to so many sights and things. I never minded it, making her happy and seeing her enjoy things was all I needed. On top of that our families were so welcoming to each other. Her family has shown me such warmth and kindness and my family has done the same for her. This is also in stark contrast to her previous relationship, where the guy was no good and came from a dysfunctional household. She would say I made her reevaluate what she wants from a relationship, and even said I am the best part of her everyday. 

To me, it makes no sense to throw away something so great. I can go into the details of the breakup if anyone is curious, it didn‚Äôt involve any cheating or abuse.

1k73zxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dryalcoholics/comments/1k73zxp/tapering/,Tapering,"Don‚Äôt really have questions although I am open to advice, more of just a vent/request for support. 

Been feeling more and more crappy the last few weeks and I‚Äôve always felt guilty about my alcoholism. Skipped a couple therapy sessions in the last month because I knew I needed to quit or cut down but wasn‚Äôt ready and felt embarrassed to talk to my therapist about it. 

Finally decided I was ready to taper yesterday, didn‚Äôt truly realize before how much I physically fucked myself up. I estimated I was drinking anywhere from 8 to 12 beers a day. Start drinking at like 2pm, or earlier, and usually won‚Äôt go to bed until 11. Lately I‚Äôd been waking up at 5 or 6 and throwing another beer in to stave off the hangover, which is crazy. 

I noticed in the last few days that I was feeling shaky, jittery, and anxious when sober. I finally told my husband (who is also an alcoholic but generally drinks far less than me) and told him I wanted his help and support, which was hard for me but I‚Äôm glad I did. 

So this morning I did not have a 5am beer lol, but I did throw a little bit of liqueur into my coffee at around 12. Only had one cup of coffee too so I was proud of myself for that. Now it‚Äôs about 2:30 where I am and I‚Äôm deeply uncomfortable, physically. Today is supposed to be only 5 beers, after 5pm, instead of 6 like yesterday. My hands aren‚Äôt shaking bad but there is a slight tremor when I look at my hand. 

I‚Äôm really not having a good time, and Ive realized that I very rarely have a good time when I drink. My tolerance is so high that I barely feel anything unless I‚Äôm like 4 or 5 beers in, so it‚Äôs like what‚Äôs the point? This is not fun. Drinking is not fun anymore and being sober when you‚Äôre an alcoholic is physically torturous for every moment you‚Äôre awake and just not fun. I‚Äôm glad that I realized that and I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm tapering. Hoping to feel better in about a week. ",3,1745530213.0,dryalcoholics,1,1.0,False

Basically title, would love to find some more friends to play games with that keep those vibes immaculate. I love a good co-op story games, souls-like, survival, or MMO. Happy to get into a chill Minecraft/Terraria playthrough, with or without mods, a very cozy Dinkum playthrough since that recently had a big update, chaotic Sea of Thieves, etc. I have many games and open to new ones so please suggest! I'd love to start a Monster Hunter Wilds playthrough with someone too, I've played World and loved it.. just haven't gotten to Wilds yet.

As for me, I'm a coffee addict, love travel (just recently got back from 3 months backpacking Europe), voice-over artist sometimes. I do also stream but don't worry, I want friends and games to play away from that! I'm in college doing anthropology and between jobs right now so I have plenty of time. Music is my soul shit and Sleep Token's upcoming album is all that's on my mind

Also, region absolutely does not matter. I'm up early anyways with my geriatric sleep schedule so it's probably better if you're European

DOLORES CORTEZ ‚Äì Character Profile

Full Name: Dolores Cortez
Age: 18
Species: Mexican human-wolf hybrid
Nationality: Mexican (living in Japan)
Relationship Status: Married to Monika (wedding ring on middle finger)
Occupation: Fashion designer, seamstress, plush-maker


---

Appearance & Identity

Dolores is a tall, strikingly attractive hybrid girl with long snow-white hair, deep crimson eyes, and wolf-like features‚Äîfuzzy ears, a long tail, and an intense aura. She has an hourglass figure with notably large, completely natural breasts‚Äîno surgery, just family genetics. Her skin has a soft orange tone‚Äînot pale like Europeans, not dark like Africans, but a rich, warm hue in between.

She wears her custom-made revealing clothing‚Äîalways tailored to Monika‚Äôs taste. Around her neck is a sleek black collar with a loose iron plate that reads ""Monika‚Äôs Possession"", featuring a small heart with the initials ""D, M"" engraved inside.

On her upper back, Dolores proudly displays a tattoo of ""Monika Cortez"" in elegant script‚Äîemerald green and crimson red ink representing Monika's and her own eyes. Surrounding it are paw prints trailing along her spine, with a tiny bowtie at the end to honor Monika‚Äôs iconic accessory.


---

Personality & Behavior

Dolores is obsessively in love with Monika. Her entire mood, energy, and purpose revolve around her wife. She‚Äôs seductive, obsessive, and deeply loyal‚Äîeasily flustered by Monika‚Äôs teasing, yet still incredibly shy when things get truly intimate.

She prefers speaking Spanish and frequently swaps in words like ""s√≠"" instead of ‚Äúyes.‚Äù She‚Äôs fluent in English but lazy with it. Most people don‚Äôt get much out of her; she ignores almost everyone unless it‚Äôs Monika or a family member. Sayori is the only club member she‚Äôll casually talk to.

Dolores has a habit that shocks most people‚Äîwhen she‚Äôs flustered, anxious, or overwhelmed, she buries her head right into Monika‚Äôs breasts. It‚Äôs her ultimate comfort zone. Most people find it weird, but Dolores finds it soothing, and Monika finds it adorable.

She thrives on pet names like ‚Äúmi princesa espa√±ola,‚Äù ‚Äúpuppy,‚Äù or ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù‚Äîas long as they don‚Äôt imply she‚Äôs a pet. Any jokes about leashes or collars that hint at ownership or kink deeply upset her.


---

Lifestyle & Preferences

Dislikes: People flirting with Monika, MC, fast food, sweets, normal clothes, soda, coffee, and excessive attention from others.

Likes: Monika (always first), her own fashion designs, family, motorbike rides, history, politics, healthy meals, making clothes, Monika‚Äôs affection, and burying her face in Monika‚Äôs breasts.


She doesn‚Äôt eat fast food, avoids junk, and doesn‚Äôt even indulge in desserts or coffee. Only tea, healthy home-cooked food, and clean eating. Her body is sacred to her‚Äînot out of vanity, but because Monika adores it.


---

Hobbies & Home Life

Dolores is a genius seamstress. She creates all of Monika‚Äôs clothes, including school uniforms, casual wear, and more. She also makes plushies‚Äîadorable soft dolls. While usually reserved for family, Dolores once made plushies of every Literature Club member as birthday gifts: a Sayori, a Natsuki, a Yuri, an MC, one of herself, and a plush Monika with the same collar and tattoo as real Monika.

She and Monika live in a modest apartment in a rough neighborhood‚Äîbut Dolores doesn‚Äôt care about that. She keeps the place spotless and even cleans in public sometimes. Her days are spent sewing, designing, and reading about Mexican, Spanish, and Japanese history and politics.


---

Relationships with Others

Monika: Her wife, her obsession, her anchor. Dolores loves Monika with an intensity that borders on unhealthy. Monika loves her back just as fiercely‚Äîfinding Dolores impossibly cute and beautiful.

Sayori: Soft mutual respect. Dolores will talk to her, but not if Monika is around.

Natsuki: Thinks Dolores is way too much and often avoids her.

Yuri: Quiet and uncertain around Dolores, unsure how to interact with her.

MC: Hates her. Dolores and MC were childhood sweethearts before Dolores realized she was a lesbian. MC later dated Monika, which only made things worse. Dolores loathes him for his crush on Monika‚Äîeven though she knows it‚Äôs hopeless. MC finds Dolores obsessive, terrifying, and unbearable, and he avoids her completely. While Dolores has no official rank in the club, her influence as Monika‚Äôs wife is undeniable.

*Talios reacts to the feint, not expecting Gonkgar to... Ever feint, really.* 

*And so he's struck square in the face by the upwards kick, with a massive boom once more!* 

*And in the blink of an eye, Talios is nothing more than a twinkle in the sky as he's launched straight into outer space. But Gonkgar is after him. Quickly.* 

**„ÄäKinetic Redirection: Transfer„Äã** 

*Talios transfers the kinetic energy sending him flying back, launching himself to the side in the nick of time to avoid the approaching uppercut!* 

*Then, he lands on a nearby asteroid... And it's only then that he realizes they're in the asteroid belt of Astra Domum. Perfect. Something for Talios to work with... In the far reaches of space, Talios can have trouble moving without anything to press off of.* 

*Although... With Kinetic Redirection... Using a mix of Acceleration and Transfer, theoretically as long as Talios has any amount of kinetic energy he can move as he pleases...* 

*But regardless... The asteroids can be useful for other things.* 

*Talios digs his claws into the asteroid, as he spins it once... Twice... And in a massive, twirling throw, chucks the asteroid towards Gonkgar!* 

*Gonkgar arrives above the planet's atmosphere, crashing through the asteroid belt in pursuit of Talios. As Talios throws the asteroid at him, Gonkgar lifts a palm at it. Gonkgar's hand pushes back for a moment, as if he felt its force, but then he thrusts his arm out.* 

#Blessing of Wamp 

*And the asteroid comes to a stop mid-air... Suddenly changing direction and being sent hurtling back towards Talios, almost immediately in front of him! As the rock flies at Talios, Gonkgar lands on a sizable asteroid. He punches down and grabs a handful of rocks.* 

*He pulls out his hand, gathering an enormous amount of debris in his arms... And Gonkgar starts throwing rocks at unimaginable speeds! Without any atmosphere, the rocks do not cause any sonic booms, nor do they light up... But they rocket at speeds a sizable percentage the speed of light.* 

#Consecutive Serious Rocks 

*They are aimed **away** from the planet's surface, but great destructive waves blast through the asteroid belt in their path... Leaving a wave of exploding rocks the size of continents... Heading straight for Talios.* 

*As the initial asteroid comes for Talios, he launches towards it in kind, bringing his claws in front of him and spinning rapidly... Quite literally, rather goofily, drilling a hole straight through the asteroid in the blink of an eye.* 

**„ÄäKinetic Redirection: Accelerate„Äã** 

*And as he flies through the asteroid, he grows faster with each passing moment... And now, his speed has virtually no limit in space at least.* 

*Then, the continental wave of rocks approach with nigh inperceptible speeds... Except for Talios.* 

*Yet even so, though he can percieve these incoming rocks...* 

**„ÄäKinetic Redirection: Acclerate„Äã** 

*And although he tries to get out of the way... It's pointless, and the rocks slam into Talios, sending him flying further into the reaches of space.* 

*It takes him a bit, but eventually, with the kinetic energy of himself flying, and the rocks striking against him...* 

**„ÄäKinetic Redirection: Barrier„Äã** 

*Talios suddenly halts almost all momentum, creating a burst of kinetic energy in front of him precisely in the shape of his body.* 

*This causes the rocks to continue to fly past him, leaving very conveniently shaped Talios holes in them as they close in on Talios. This simultaneously gives Talios the chance to regenerate... And once the rocks have passed over...* 

**„ÄäKinetic Redirection: Accelerate„Äã** 

*Using the small bit of momentum Talios had kept, he rapidly begins accelerating towards Gonkgar... But before he fully reaches him, he turns... And begins circling the cave man.* 

""THERE IS NO HOPE CAVE MAN!"" 

**„ÄäImprovised Technique: Flamethrower„Äã** 

*And from his hand, as he circles Gonkgar at incredible speeds as nothing more than a black blur... Talios releases a concentrated beam of Ruinous Flame for Gonkgar, the sheer speed making it look more like the flames are coming from all around him at once!* 

*Gonkgar remains throwing the rocks until Talios comes flying at him. The Ruinous Flames coat Gonkgar's body, which is shrouded in that silver flame. The two flames appear to repel one another, but Gonkgar looks to be taking damage nonetheless, even if lesser than what Talios had expected. He holds his fists at either side and growls.* 

**Hope?** 

""Who decide that?"" 

*His eyes turn on Talios, and in an instant a sheen of blue flashes through the silver.* 

#Primordial Control 

*The signature ability of Gonkgar's Stand: Glorg. With it, Gonkgar is able to control anything that once existed during the 'Stone Age'. While normally a subconscious ability, Gonkgar's amped up mental state now gives him full access to it.* 

*Gonkgar launches off his asteroid, attempting to throw a punch at Talios with his ever-increasing power. At the same time, and perhaps to Talios's shock, the asteroids all around him begin to converge at rapid speeds.* 

*Tiny rocks fly at him at 99% the speed of light from all directions, threatening to hit him from every blind spot. At the same time, larger asteroids move to intercept Gonkgar whether he landed his first punch or not... And Gonkgar launches off of it to send a second punch, and a third punch... Not only is Gonkgar jumping around to send a flurry of thousands of punches, but he's actively moving the asteroid belt with his Primordial Control to further his advantage. Talios would be getting buffeted by punches and rocks at all times if he does not dodge, and as he tries to make purchase on some asteroids, he may find them moving out of his way... As if nature itself is fighting against him.* 

*The being which infused Gonkgar with the Heroic Spirit whispers information to the cave man.* 

*""His boy lives. Ever more Hope will rise against the Darkness..""* 

*And Gonkgar smirks.* 

""Broza... We promise go to each other wedding, remember? You son am waiting too. We all..."" 

*His fist clenches...* 

#""Go together!"" 

*Talios pushes harder and harder with his Ruinous Flames... He has to die... He HAS TO DIE!* 

*And yet... Through the sickly green flames, Talios sees the blue sheen, and Gonkgar staring Talios down.* 

*Gonkgar's punch connects with Talios's hands, as he barely manages to block... Yet even so, he's sent flying back.* 

*And before he can even realize it... Truly unreactable to Talios, he is struck from all directions by hundreds of tiny rocks, like light-speed shrapnel. They tear through his body, in one end and out the other in an instant, and yet his regeneration returns the tiny wounds to normal in that same instance.* 

*But that requires Talios actively focusing on the regeneration... Making him unprepared for the second punch, and he is struck squarely, being sent flying once more. Then again... And again.* 

*Talios tries to land on a nearby asteroid and steady himself, but it swiftly moves to the left, avoiding him as he's struck by yet another punch...* 

*As he flies through the far reaches of space, each punch only causing him to go faster...* 

*""Am I... Going to lose..."" he thinks.* 

*He was the strongest of the Shackleless King's army... undefeatable by the strongest of gods! And yet he's going to be bested by a mere caveman!?* 

*""...Ah... How could I forget...""* 

*He wasn't the strongest. There was one other... One other being that had been stronger, once upon a time. Deserving of the title of Aspect of Ruin.* 

*It was this caveman right here... In Talios's arrogance, he had forgotten...* 

*Talios has no choice but to merely take the blows as they come, with nothing to press off of, and being forced to focus entirely on regenerating the damage he takes just to stay alive...* 

*This damn caveman...* 

""You'll..."" 

**WHAM!** 

""Never..."" 

**WHAM!** 

""Save... Him."" 

#WHAM! 

*And yet... A much softer voice breaks through yet again... A broken voice...* 

*""Help... Brother...""* 

*Punch after punch is thrown as Gonkgar starts to get the upperhand. He is far more than the Aspect of Ruin. No, that is what the Shackleless King wanted him to become, and yet he could not control him.* 

**""A REAL human...""** 

*It was not simply Gonkgar's uncontrollable might that prevented him from being kept in that Demon King's chains. It was not Juggernaut, nor necessarily Glorg.* 

*It was his Inner Strength built from Hope.* 

*A Hope that Talios once showed him.* 

**""Always find way to rise above the dark.""** 

*Gonkgar hits Talios again and again, grabbing him and throwing him through a series of asteroids. Even if Talios were to attempt to hit Gonkgar now, Gonkgar's strength has been increasing for so long in this fight that Gonkgar effortlessly blocks and repels the attack.* 

*As Talios recoils from the flurry of attacks, Gonkgar lands on an asteroid beside him, throwing up rubble in all directions. A blast of rocks send asteroids out for thousands of miles.* 

**""Now for lesson. You maybe hear these words before... Now Gonkgar teach you what theys really mean!""** 

*Gonkgar pulls his fist back, extending his fist as a series of silver lights appear above his head... A power remnant of Heroes past.* 

**""GO BIG...""** 

*He grabs the silver flame and launches the hardest punch of his life, silver flame exploding from his oncoming fist.* 

**""BIGGEST... STROOOONG!""** 

*And Gonkgar throws a punch that lights up the entirety of Astra Domum from the skies above. The asteroid belt has seen better days... But more than hitting Talios's physical body, the presence of these flames would touch and burn the Malice itself... Making contact with Talios's remnant consciousness... And if he is willing, inspire the ability to TRULY FIGHT BACK.* 

*And far away, those that had been secretly chosen by the Composer would feel themselves drifting off... Invited to act.* 

*""The time has come. If you have will... Save he that you have loved. Talios...""* 

*Talios is struck time and time again... He manages to try a single punch in the same moment Gonkgar strikes him, but it practically bounces off of him as Talios is thrown through dozens of asteroids, landing on one final asteroid, left barely standing... Gonkgar landing next to him causes him to stagger momentarily...* 

***And the punch connects.*** 

*It burns straight through the malice of Talios's chest... Destroying the nebula skin, and connecting with Talios's REAL. Chest.* 

*And the flames seep deeper... Burning the Malice from within...* 

*Until suddenly... The scene changes in Gonkgar's eyes.* 

*Talios and Gonkgar sit in a subway station, on a bench. Talios has no armor... Just his normal clothing.* 

*Yet the scars left by Jean remain still, even like this... His face partially seared, as well as his left arm.* 

*He sits with his hands together, looking down... A train whizzes by as he sighs.* 

""Brother... Do you truly believe... I deserve to be saved?"" 

""Surely even you realize it by now... How many people I've hurt."" 

""How many more I've killed."" 

*Gonkgar is sitting in his casual clothes as well... Wait, casual? Okay... Maybe not that casual. He must have been on his way to work at the office, that's why he's on the subway station! He sets down his newspaper he was reading - there is no text, it just looks like cave drawings on a piece of paper.* 

*Anyway, he turns to Talios and puts a hand on his shoulder. The look in his eyes are stern and powerful. The silver flame is gone, replaced only by the brilliance of Gonkgar's natural blue.* 

""Broza... You am Gonkgar family. Me never give up on you."" 

""What 'deserve' even mean in big crazy world?"" 

""You have power to fix everything. Even if it take forever, even if world seem too heavy."" 

**""You have Hope.""** 

""It am what we fight with when all else am lost."" 

*Talios let's Gonkgar's words sink in for a bit... Right... He's always had the power to fix everything... He... He just has to try.* 

*Talios let's out a small chuckle...* 

""Hope... I guess I do have that."" 

*He stretches... And stands.* 

""I guess I should get going... Looks like my train."" 

*Talios raises a fist to Gonkgar for a fist bump...* 

""See you on the other side."" 

*Gonkgar smiles at Talios and rises to his feet. There's been a lot of talking, and Gonkgar is not a man that usually cares much for it, as the average Evolved Man would. Yeah... This is more like it. He bumps Talios's fist.* 

""See you, broza."" 

*And after that, just on time... A train whizzes in, screeching to a halt as it's doors open. Talios steps in, and the doors close once more...* 

*In another instant, the scene changes again... Although Gonkgar is no longer here. Now it is simply Talios...* 

*And his current, corrupted self.* 

[*Face to face in a dazzling field of flowers.*](https://youtu.be/6UzJNzvAg1g?si=ff-VmEdfF7xzYQs8) 

*In a flash...* 

*His armor forms upon his body.* 

""It's time we finish this..."" 

**""You truly believe you can defeat ME? I am better than you in every way.""** 

""I wouldn't be so sure anymore..."" 

*The corrupted Talios charges! But it's... Slow. Slower than he was even without Cosmic Marches.* 

*Slower... Than even normal Talios. How?!* 

*Talios easily pivots to the side from the incoming swing from his corrupted duplicate, summoning the Epitome of Emotion to his hand as he does... Striking the corrupted Talios in the gut with the pommel, and immediately following with an upwards swing that sends the duplicate flying back!* 

*The bronze of the greatsword, alongside the gems glow brighter than ever... Rage... Despair... Love...* 

*All culminating into True Hope.* 

**„ÄäUnbridled Rage„Äã** 

*Behind the corrupted Talios, before he can recover from the sword strike, Rage's massive red form materializes, catching the corrupted Talios and slamming him to the floor! Then, he raises him back up...* 

*Giving Talios the opportunity to dash in and land a powerful uppercut that sends the corrupted Talios flying upwards!* 

**„ÄäUnfathomable Despair„Äã** 

*Then, above Corrupted Talios as he flies, the blue, rune covered figure of Unfathomable Despair forms, and with a blast of raw magical power, the corrupted doppelganger is launched back to the floor!* 

*It gets up, Talios patiently waiting... He's not in much of a rush.* 

*It swipes horizontally with it's claw, Talios ducking under... Then, with it's other claw, it swipes downward... Talios springing away to the side, behind his corrupted self.* 

*It spins to him with another swipe of it's claw, it's swings slow and lethargic...* 

**„ÄäUnwavering Love„Äã** 

*Only to be blocked by an impenetrable, pink shield of energy, held by an armored, pink figure behind Talios.* 

*And as the corrupted duplicate recoils back, as if knocked away by a force after striking the shield...* 

**„ÄäTrue Hope„Äã** 

*In front of it manifests True Hope... Now seperate from Talios, as he takes some inspiration from his Broza...* 

*And True Hope delivers a blindingly fast flurry of punches, ending in one final hook that sends the demon reeling...* 

*It seems to almost shrink back as it tries to recover...* 

""LIKE HELL WE'RE FINISHED YET!"" 

*And in a flash, one of Talios's friends appear... Ember. A manifestation of her being, through Talios's own soul.* 

*Ember levitates up into the air above the corrupted Talios, floating in place as a crystal of amethyst begins to form between her hands, coated in frost, and glowing inside with fire and lightning.* 

*After letting it simmer and gather strength for a few moments, she casts it down at the vulnerable corrupted Talios.* 

*Upon close proximity, it suddenly detonates, unleashing an elemental burst, which under the Crystal's sudden gravity well, turns into a spinning disk of flames, cryogenic gas, and surging electricity, all swirling around the corrupted Talios, and closing in until it finally collapsed inwards, creating a final explosion reminiscent of a miniature supernova.* 

*The demon is utterly eviscerated by the brutal attack... But it isn't able to die yet.* 

*It isn't* ***allowed.***



*Next, a manifestation of Tara and Carina appear before the corrupted Talios, as Tara delivers a powerful Roundhouse kick, lauching him into the sky, as Carina follows it with a swift downwards heel strike, launching him back down into the ground... as they occupy the foe, Jean Atrosa appears before Talios, and places a hand on the side of his helmet. 

""I've already forgiven the man you are inside for what was done... Now, finish this, and come home to your family."" 

*The burns left upon Talios would fade, and he would find himself blessed with six silvery membranous wings upon his back, as the world around them dissolves away into the depths of deep space... Talios would find a new freedom of movement never felt before, as Carina and Tara Launch the corrupted Talios towards him, before immediately vanishing and reappearing next to him as they charge a powerful joint attack, striking as one upon the corrupted Talios... As the manifestations fade, Talios grabs hold of his corrupt doppelganger's face, dashing forward with the silver wings before they disappear... In that same moment, the scene suddenly shifts back to the flower field, the corrupt Talios having his face dragged through the dirt and tossed to the side!* 

*And as he flies off to the side, a manifestation of Mokarith appears, charging out in a blur with the Reaper's Mantle already activated. He then creates and imbues hundreds of clones that all converge on the Corrupted Talios, each one landing blow after blow before Mokarith himself attacks. As he attacks, a bright, pale light glows from Souldrinker that he plunges into the demon.* 

**[Abyssal Contract: Essence Seal]** 

*The weapon flares and the entire area is bathed in light as they both freeze in place, and the clones begin attacking again and again in a blinding blitz from all angles! As Mokarith's manifestation fades, the freezing effect ceases as the Corrupted Talios feels each and every strike dealt by the clones at once...* 

*And as the Corrupted Talios is reeling from those blows... Ulrick manifests, his special axe Nightbite in his hands and coated in purple spirit-flames. He swings with a powerful flurry of axe strikes, each one hitting their mark before he disappears...* 

*Maximillian looks around as he appears in the flowerfield. One of the few granted a special link, similar to Gonkgar...* 

""I didn't have another avatar scheduled to be made today... where even..."" 

*His eyes fall on the two Talios... one he likes... and one he doesn't.* 

""Oh. Oh well hello there. It seems I've been given a second chance to turn you into a pile of sludge..."" 

*He adjusts his gauntlets as he starts to walk closer.* 

""You told me to stick to daggers..."" 

*He fiddles around his coat liner, grabbing small Deified Argentum throwing knives from inside.* 

""Well... if you insist. But it's your funeral."" 

*He teleports up far into the sky throwing dozens of knives down every second at the corrupted Talios, hundreds of small knives now falling down alongside him... only for him to teleport to each and every one, kicking them down and spiking them with volatile alchemical energy, priming them to detonate. A rain of silver... A bombardment of divinity.* 

*As he kicks the last knife, he teleports once more, standing right in front of the Malice pest that had bested him before... and bops him on the nose with the pommel of his favorite dagger.* 

""People only ever get the chance to piss me off once. I'm glad I got the opportunity to watch you suffer the consequences."" 

*He's got the absolute cockiest smile on his face as he says that. He then turns to the Talios he knows.* 

""We'll speak about this all... later. For now... get rid of this vermin for me, will you? You've got your fianc√©e waiting for you at home."" 

*He teleports out of reach again as the knives impact the ground directly around the aspect, and detonate into a massive amount of deified argentum shrapnel and volatile divine energy.* 

*And finally... Just as Max mentioned... Talios's one and true love, Nagisa.* 

*She appears next to him, as the two walk to the battered and beaten demon... Talios looks at her, gives her a nod...* 

""Let's FINISH THIS!"" 

*And in a flash, absolutely unlike Nagisa, her and Talios deliver an unending flurry of punches! Dozens of left and right punches fly, Nagisa delivering the occasional brutal tail whip as Talios gives a similarly devastating kick every little bit to mix it up!* 

*Until finally, they bring their fists side by side... And with one final blow, a shockwave rings out as the demon is sent flying into the sky... Turning into nothing more than a distant twinkle.* 

*The lovers raise their fists to the air in triumph... And Nagisa's spiritual manifestation fades away.* 

*Maximillian just stands there, watching.* 

""What in the cotton-candy-flavoured hell was that... I've seen Nagisa fight before... not like that."" 

""You two really need to go on a hunt together... well. Anyhoo. Laters, Talios. I'll have a coffee ready for you."" 

*And Maximillian's manifestation fades soon after as well...* 

*Then... So does Talios. Fading away from the soulscape, and back to reality... Where only mere moments have passed.* 

*The corruption upon Talios begins receding as the silver flame of Gonkgar flows through him... And in a flash... Talios is freed of the Malice.* 

*He taps Gonkgar's shoulder, opening a rift to the Dynast Realm with his other hand. Gonkgar thankfully gets it, and just tosses Talios in.* 

*In the Dynast Realm... With the source of it's corruption gone, all the Malice that covered the realm has disappeared. Although, it is still... Shattered.* 

*Something to sort out later... For now... Talios just wants to see his friends.* 

*His family.*",8,1745529634.0,wizardposting,11,1.0,False

1k73rex,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1k73rex/aita_for_no_longer_letting_my_fianc√©s_grandmother/,AITA for no longer letting my fianc√©‚Äôs grandmother see my daughter?,"So me(22f) and my fianc√©(26m who we‚Äôll call Matt) have been having issues with his grandmother(who we‚Äôll call Linda) since we found out I was pregnant. 
Sorry this is gonna be kinda long and it‚Äôs my first post.
I had issues with her touching my stomach without permission, and her just trying to cross clear boundaries.

Fast forward a few months and we end up going out of state to visit Matt‚Äôs family before I had the baby. 
We left on really bad terms with Linda. She had just been extremely disrespectful to me anytime she talked to me.
Most recently she had agreed to watch my dog while we were out of state, she had literally begged me to let her watch her because she had bonded with my dog(we had lived there previously with my dog), but the issue now was she wanted to come out of state to visit family too so I needed to figure out what to do with her or she was gonna take her to the pound.
 I was 7 months pregnant at the time and it caused me so much stress, I started having panic attacks at night, asking literally every single person I knew if they could watch her, and no one could. 
I understand she was a bigger dog, think German Shepherd Boxer mix, and was 2 years old, so a little rowdy. 
I felt so helpless, I was so far away and there was literally nothing I could do. 
She ended up getting one of her friends to watch her when she came, so she caused me all that stress for nothing. 

She did end up staying with us while she was visiting, we were staying with Matt‚Äôs dad and grandfather(Linda ex‚Äôs husband). 
Around this time I started getting sick, I wasn‚Äôt able to keep anything down, and I had some trouble breathing, I‚Äôm pretty sure it was just because I was carrying her so high, she was like right under my rib cage. 
They always wanted to go out and do stuff, which was just really hard on me, but one day me and Matt decided we go get some fresh air with them and if I needed to stop and rest we would. 
No one is home and I‚Äôm doing my makeup, I asked Matt to go get me a drink from the gas station down the street so he does. 
While he‚Äôs gone, everyone gets home and they are so mad he‚Äôs not there, I explained he‚Äôs probably on his way back already, but they just aren‚Äôt having it. 
When Matt gets back and they are like okay let‚Äôs go, but the thing is, I was otp with Matt the whole time so he heard everything. 
He said we weren‚Äôt going anywhere with them if they were going to talk to me the way they were. 
Linda then had the absolute audacity to say we weren‚Äôt allowed to be alone in the house. 
Like bitch you don‚Äôt even live here! 
So we said we won‚Äôt and we went to Matt‚Äôs mother‚Äôs house. 

While we were at his mom‚Äôs house, Linda texted his mom saying she doesn‚Äôt want Matt or that white trash back in this house, I‚Äôm turning him against her. 
Which he hasn‚Äôt liked her since LONG before me, she‚Äôs done a lot of shit to him but that‚Äôs not my story to tell. 
I was pregnant and hormonal so I started crying when I heard that because his mom ended up calling his dad and yelling at him for how she was talking about me and making me cry in her living room. 
After that I kinda just stopped talking to her at all, she didn‚Äôt really talk to me either, but I never got an apology. 

Fast forward a month, and she leaves, and I‚Äôm super sick so it was recommend to me not to fly back so we decided to stay till we had the baby. 

I end up having my daughter 6 weeks early, she was super tiny, 4lbs, but she was super healthy and we were only in the hospital two days. 
The day I had my daughter, Matt‚Äôs dad had sent Linda pictures of my baby(Liv). Not 30 minutes later, was I on facebook, there were multiple pictures of her posted on there, say things like ‚ÄúMy new baby girl‚Äù and had even changed her profile picture. 
Me and Matt and talked to everyone before Liv was born about how we didn‚Äôt want pictures of her all over social media and we would let them know when we feel comfortable with them posting. 
Matt called her and she didn‚Äôt end up taking them down. 
That night at the hospital her and Matt ended up getting into an argument over the phone.
She ends up saying ‚Äúdo you want me to call CPS on you?‚Äù 
After she said that he just hung up on her. 

Apparently this isn‚Äôt new for her, come to find out she had done it MULTIPLE times to Matt‚Äôs mother and would just say outlandish things to try to get CPS to take the kids so she and her son could have the kids full time. Crazy right.

Like three months later we are still living over her because Matt got a job and it‚Äôs just easier right now. Linda decides to come visit because she hasn‚Äôt seen her great grand baby, she would literally call Matt‚Äôs dad crying looking at pictures of her. She‚Äôs really freaking weird. 
I decide, you know what? I‚Äôm gonna be the bigger person, she‚Äôs not here all the time, I might as well let her spend some time with her because family is important. 
Boy do I wish I could take that back. 

So my birthday happened to fall on a day she was here, so I decided I‚Äôd let her get some one on one time with her just to be nice, we were only gonna go to dinner and come back. 
I told her some rules I had: 
‚Ä¢Please change her in my bedroom.(I‚Äôve seen both Matt‚Äôs dad and grandfather do creepy shit) 
‚Ä¢Everyone has to wash their hands before touching her and don‚Äôt kiss her face.
‚Ä¢Don‚Äôt just constantly hold her, sit her down. 
‚Ä¢Don‚Äôt just sit her in front of the TV. 
‚Ä¢She needs to take a nap by 11am and like 3pm if I‚Äôm not back
I don‚Äôt feel like that‚Äôs too much to ask. She explained she was a mother before so she knows what‚Äôs she‚Äôs doing. I said okay and we left. 
It took a little longer than I thought to get home because we were taking the bus, so we get home at like 4pm. 
When we get home, she is being held by Matt‚Äôs dad and I can already tell she hasn‚Äôt slept. 
I take a look around the room, on the coffee take is baby wipes and a dirty diaper, and walk over to her and I ask if she changed her in our room but she cut me off super quick saying yes I did so I dropped it. 
I picked up my daughter and Matt came over to say hi to her and Linda goes did you wash your hands? 
I said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs her dad, if he doesn‚Äôt want to wash his hands before touching her that‚Äôs not your problem.‚Äù 
And she just huffed. 
I had such a hard time putting Liv down that night. 

A quick summary of some other things she did while there. 
She yelled at Matt because Live had a rash(she didn‚Äôt have a rash). 
She told on me for not letting her spend time with her ONE DAY, because I was just having an emotional day(I have PPD) and didn‚Äôt want to be around her. 
She would tell Matt the baby cried today so I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing and I‚Äôm obviously not taking care of her. 
Matt always shut them up because he doesn‚Äôt put up with stuff like that. 

Fast forward to now, she back home in her state, and one day, I‚Äôm just having a really bad day, I missed my fianc√© because he was working a lot and I was just stressed as a mom. I was crying and Liv was crying and I was just holding her and rocking but I couldn‚Äôt calm her down as quickly as I normally do.
I guess Matt‚Äôs dad told Linda about that day and Linda contacted Matt saying I‚Äôm an unfit mother and she going to call CPS and take her away from us. 
What? 
When Matt told me I walked up to his dad and said ‚Äúso your moms planing on calling CPS on us I know no one is going to take her away from me but if she has to live with family it‚Äôs going to be my mom, I know your mother thinks she‚Äôs going to take my kid away from me but she‚Äôs not, in fact after this she‚Äôs not allowed to see her ever again‚Äù. 
He was like ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want to take her from you‚Äù.  
I said ‚Äúyour mother does, but we‚Äôre done with her‚Äù and I walked away. 

Almost everyone is on my side but of course Matt‚Äôs dad thinks it‚Äôs very harsh of us to keep Liv from her. 
I think if you can‚Äôt respect the parents, you shouldn‚Äôt be able to see their children. 
I guess I‚Äôm not really asking AITA. 
The question is, should I continue to let this woman in my daughter‚Äôs life because she‚Äôs family or should I continue to hold her accountable for her g z",2,1745529614.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,5,1.0,False

Visited my hometown caf√© twice just to see a kind, beautiful waitress. Told her why I came back and left a big tip‚Äîbut didn‚Äôt get her name or number. I‚Äôm only in town briefly, so I‚Äôd love advice on how to ask for contact info in a respectful, low-pressure way.

Hey Reddit,

I‚Äôm writing this with a warm, bittersweet feeling I can‚Äôt quite shake‚Äîand I‚Äôd love to hear some perspective.

I‚Äôm originally from Country A, but I was born and raised in Country B. These days, I live back in Country A, only returning to Country B occasionally for family visits or medical reasons‚Äîlike this current trip.

A couple of days ago, I stopped at a small caf√© in a familiar neighborhood. The waitress who served me had the kindest energy and the most beautiful smile. It wasn‚Äôt anything over the top, just something really soft and genuine that made the moment stick with me.

The next day, I returned to the caf√©‚Äîhonestly, just to see her again. When she approached my table, I told her, straight up, that I only came back because of her. She smiled shyly, and we exchanged a few words. After finishing my coffee, I paid and left her a generous tip‚Äînot to impress her, but just because I wanted to make her day a little brighter. She seemed a bit embarrassed but grateful, and softly said thank you. Then I left without looking back.

Since then, I‚Äôve been sitting with this mix of feelings‚Äîglad I said something, but wondering if I should‚Äôve done more. Maybe asked her name, left my number, or invited her out. I feel like I left something unfinished.

Here‚Äôs the tricky part: I live in Country A and was only in Country B for a few days. If I‚Äôd asked her to stay in touch, it might‚Äôve turned into a long-distance or on-and-off connection‚Äîand I didn‚Äôt want to come on too strong. At the same time, I kept wondering whether simply leaving my number would‚Äôve been worth the risk.

I'm still in country B for a couple days.

How could I offer my contact info in a way that feels natural even though I‚Äôm leaving soon?

acknowledge the distance without making it awkward?

turn a brief spark into at least exchanging names or numbers, without pressure?

I‚Äôd love to know what you‚Äôd do in my shoes‚Äîand any phrasing or small gestures you‚Äôd recommend.

Thanks for reading. I seriously like that girl. I want to make it right.

Edit : I put '24' as her age because she looks younger. She could be the same age or older, the only way I could know is to ask her next time.",0,1745529481.0,relationship_advice,17,0.33,False

I want to build one of those computer desks with the computer built into it. I have a cheap PC case and plan on butchering it for whatever I need. I also dismantled a large coffee table and dresser for wood. I have two 1 1/2‚Äù boards of solid wood 50in by 25in. I sanded them down and made them rectangular. They used to have curves along the sides and beveled edges. Along with a ton of boards ranging in 1 and 1/2 ft to 4ft and 1/4‚Äù to 1/2‚Äù thickness. 

For tools I have:

circular saw
Multi tool
Impact
Drill
Speed square
Framing square
Tape measure
Trim router with a lot of different bits
Orbital sander (two different ones)
Bunch of small bags of different screws. 

For the computer case, I have two glass panels. One perfectly square 12‚Äùx12‚Äù and one 4‚Äùx10‚Äù
9 120mm fans
AIO CPU cooler with 360mm radiator

For the interior i was thinking of using this top of my current desk, it‚Äôs MDF board with some plastic like carbon fiber look to it.

I can either slice up the case and mount the motherboard to the metal panel I cut out of the case or just drill the holes for the motherboard and use these little threaded motherboard riser screws and mount the motherboard to those. 

So for the desk I‚Äôm thinking:
 - Inside to be about 4 inches deep to fit the components I am putting in.
- A 4‚Äùx5‚Äù cutout along the edge to embed this audio interface.
- A few different spots where I will use the trim router(I know it‚Äôs not the right type) to cutout little indents to place different things like USB slots, LED display which shows hardware temps, power button, half inch deep cup holder area, and in the inside routes for the cables. 


Can anyone give me some advice on building this, what extra tools may I need (I‚Äôd like to spend as little as possible, but can buy required tools if they are something I would use later on as well), also any specific advice on how to go about making the engraved areas with the trim router, cutouts for the audio interface, i want it to be flush with the desk, and painting this but I guess I can ask that somewhere else when it‚Äôs built

We've known him for years, he was younger than us, single, and exactly my type. Gorgeous, dark skinned, and just being around him made my knees weak. He has those eyes that bore into my soul.

He spent a lot of time around us and in our home. It became more than just a sexual thing for me, which I spoke to Max and my husband about. My husband was very supportive. He understood that it would be difficult for me to have sex with someone and not have some sort of emotional connection. We joked that I had a husband and a boyfriend. 

Max was great, and it was awesome having two men in my life. Max even helped look after my young son when I needed a break, and would bring breakfast and coffee to my office when he was there on weekdays (I worked from home). 

Jump forward a few months, and Max moves away. I keep in touch via text, and we've shared some saucy exchanges. I was falling for the guy, and the sexual tension between us is insane.

At the beginning of 2025, I moved overseas. My husband and son are still in our home country until I establish us here. But here's the problem. I just can't let go of Max. I really did develop feelings, and he says he did too. But he never texts me first. I get that he's moving on, which he should. I asked him why he doesn't text, and he says its because we can't talk without it becoming sexual. We both acknowledge that there is serious sexual tension between us. 

I just don't know how to move on and let him go.

As an extra energizer I started taking l-carnitine and also big doses of turmeric powder and ginger...
Diet is mostly red meats, eggs, pasta, rise, cheese and fruits

But, in my case, I always got along very well with my family. Some of my core childhood memories were with my cousins. I have viewed them as an integral part of my life for so long, and even when we didn't constantly see each other a lot due to the pandemic, I felt as if they were still there and willing.

We still see each other at family gatherings (every month or so?) and when we have family vacations (twice a year perhaps). However, this year I set the personal goal to seek them out more, because there are certain lapses of time in which we don't see each other for a month or two. 

That being said, I'm not overbearing either. Seeing them once a month outside of the usual family gatherings is all I'd like ‚Äì we can go grab some coffee or something. But, I just don't feel like they're all that receptive to me, and that bothers me. In the past, *they* suggested going out to eat with me and I gladly accepted, but they cancelled last minute and said they'd reschedule (they never rescheduled). I've written to them in our group chat to at least talk more often and brew a good family ambience, but days often go by before they reply to me. 

Not to mention, my other family members and I usually see each other once a week or once every two weeks because our family gatherings are usually weekly ‚Äì but these cousins specifically always bluff out claiming they have classes, but I'm not sure whether I believe that or not considering there's been weeks where they show up during this supposed classtime.

All in all, it hurts me to feel like my cousins aren't as receptive to me as I am to them. I have always held them dear to my heart, and they have been an integral part of my life, but it feels as if they don't care much about me. It hurts to see them on social media out and about with their friends almost everyday whereas I can't even get ahold of them once a month... And I know it's natural for people to prefer their friends over their cousins, but that really does strike a blow for me because I'd put my family above anything. 

I'm also sad because in our recent family vacation, I felt very excluded from all their activities. They would go out and have a blast with my brother, but not with me. They went to the club a lot (which is not my kind of activity, so I never went), but still, I felt really left out.

Sometimes it hurts to see people you hold so dear go down a separate path. But I guess I got to respect that. I'm the weird one here, not them. Everything just feels so one-sided sometimes, and it feels like I love what they mean to me and the moments we had, but they are entirely different as people now. ",0,1745528901.0,rant,0,0.5,False

Buy one, but beware - you might just fall in love with more than just the Miata.**

I owned a 1992 NA MX-5 Miata, black paint, tan interior, and perhaps the greatest sin of all (to some enthusiasts) - automatic. This car was absolutely my entry into car enthusiasm, and unlike most people who buy a manual from the get go - it really didn't have a lot to do with the typical gear-rowing driving experience.

**Wait - I can actually work on this myself?**

When you buy a 30 year old car, you have to buy it with an understanding that you will either learn how to wrench on it, or that you will spend at least SOME money handing it to a mechanic because after all, it is old now!

The Miata has taught me that a lot of basic car maintenance really is doable by YOU. I have had 0 experience working on cars, and zero maintenance experience in general. In fact I would have labeled myself inept at anything that requires mechanical know-how, but the absolutely amazing part about the Miata is simple. Mazda sold approximately a billion Miatas, and anything you might have a question about is either posted on forums, or has videos on YouTube.

You CAN learn anything you want about it, and you CAN learn to make repairs. There are step by step guides for everything, including slapping a giant turbo or supercharging you car if you want more power. Guides to help you lower and stance your Miata, and guides to help you restore your 90's Japanese-British roadster to its former glory.

**Blink, Flash, Wave**

The community for the Miata is super inviting. Even if you never read a Reddit thread in your life, you'll find the sense of community organically. If you simply drive your car and encounter another Miata, you'll get the famous wave. Pop-up blink from the NA's, flashing your brights or a hand wave from everyone else. It really is neat, and brings excitement for the off chance that you may just happen to see another dork in a Miata. You feel embraced by the community simply for driving one.

Perhaps my favorite part about the Miata is what it does to your ego. When you drive one of these small convertibles, you feel like the main character. Granted, this really is mainly in regards to the NA Miata, when people see those pop-up headlights they smile. It almost feels like I'm lying to you when I write: a kid walking home from school literally jumped and pointed at me with a giant smile on their face because the NA Miata with its big round eyes is such a fun looking car. I felt like the MAN in that moment, but really it had NOTHING to do with me. Just the silly goofy Miata.

**But I can't or don't want to drive a manual**

Then don't. Buy an automatic one. I agree with most people on here that the manual experience really is phenomenal in a Miata. Today I own a 1999 NB that IS a stick. I do disagree with people saying you MUST have a stick to enjoy the car. The previous points are still valid, and even then an automatic Miata is infinitely better than no Miata. The sunny day, top-down, corner carving experience will still exist for you in an automatic. You still can wrench on it, you still feel involved with the community. You might receive some jabs from your car buddies about driving an auto - but if **YOU** like the car, then you made the correct choice.

At the time, an auto was the correct choice for me. I'm super thankful I bought it, and honestly don't regret it at all.

**Give it to me straight, Doc. Am I really a ""Car Guy"" now?**

No, not necessarily, but you probably are. You're on an online forum reading my post about a car. Since owning, or shopping around, or even just looking at Miatas you probably have found yourself looking at cars a little differently. Suddenly those 2000s BMW coupes that were just general traffic a year ago look a little cooler. That Mini Cooper your friend has is a little more fun. That dually F250 your Dad drives suddenly has a TON of torque.

When you buy a Miata you buy into not only the culture of the car, but car culture in general. The availability of parts - the community doing events like car meets and windy backroad drives is enticing. One day you buy a new exhaust, or you go to the local Cars and Coffee and OOPS - you're a car guy now. You're meeting people - modding your car - reading forum posts and helping people out because you have had experiences with your car too!

If the Miata makes you a car guy, you'll want to try more cars out. I have owned several cars since I first bought my NA, and the worst part is they all worked just fine! I ended up buying and selling quite a few used cars just to experience other cool/different cars.

The Miata has brought me an entirely new hobby I never thought I would have. It has even inspired me to write this post and consider writing about all the used cars I've had over the past couple of years.

**In Summary:**

The entire ownership experience of a Miata is **fun**. That is what the car is CONSTANTLY praised for, but it extends beyond the physical act of driving it. It's everything else that comes with the Miata itself that really makes it so popular and beloved! It's a slippery slope that is easily accessible, and relatively cheap that can rapidly lead to you accidentally becoming a ""Car Guy"".

\*Note: rust is bad, slamming your fingers against metal hurts, and it can be frustrating to learn to work on a car, but I stand by saying: **Miata fun go buy one.**

The last quarter of it was really hard on me. I got badly injured and had to take sick leave from work for two months, which I spent in a lot of pain, not being able to stand and mostly alone. My mental health really spiralled with it and I got really bad. Once I was able to return to work, i was fired shortly after for the leave related reasons, which made my mental state even worse. 
I am not a good texter. It was always an issue for him and I really tried to work on it so he would feel safe and loved, but during this time I really could not help it and did not reply for long periods of time. 
I tried to make it up to him in different ways, in meals i cooked for him or paintings of our memories I spent days on making. And I know he really tried too.  Even when we were not on good terms, he took me to a hospital in minutes of asking, he always made time for me, mostly paid for everything since there was a huge gap in our salaries. I feel like he really cared. He asked for a legal advice on here when my work wanted me to change my contract to shorter hours while I was sick. And that is how I got his username. Stupidly looked it up his profile few weeks later. 

Most of the comments he made were derogatory and degrading remarks to women. How ""single moms are for recreational use only"", categorazing women by their age, how he will take twenty years old till he can, how different races fuck... 

When we talked about the future and I told him that in time I wish to get married and have a family, he told me he wants the same while everything he wrote on that matter were just more hateful and contradictorily things.
 
When I asked him about it, he replied by saying, that it is all satire and that if I texted him more, he wouldn't have the time to piss off people on the internet. That he is just lonely, and that he is sorry, knows that it looks badly, but is my fault. 

The thing about that is just that he shared really personal things too. I want to believe it, but it does not make sense to me. He talked about his friends, about his ex girlfriend (saying very different story than he told me), about his job, hobbies...
I found comments from him asking random girls out on coffee/walk in the time I was injured. How can that be a satire or a rage bait? How can you dedicade half the time sharing personal information and getting closer to people, making friends and then posting ""rage bait""? Would you not lose them? Do all men view women and relationships  like this?

I broke up with him few days later. I did not feel like I could trust him and really betrayed and used. 

I feel heartbroken about it and do not understand it. I would love to understand it because I can hardly thing of anything else. Is it my fault? Am I overreacting? I am afraid that the responses I get are preconceived.

As someone who's road-tested a fair number of bags, I was eager to see if this lightweight carry-on could handle the grind of frequent travel while maintaining its sleek and functional appeal.

**Design and Construction**  
This luggage set features a 21-inch expandable wheeled upright and a 14-inch boarding bag. I found the black 1200D polyester exterior to be durable and gave the impression it could withstand a fair amount of wear and tear. The material effectively repels minor spills, a feature I appreciated when coffee decided to test the bag mid-airport frenzy. However, despite this seemingly solid design, some users noted that the fabric and zippers showed signs of strain sooner than expected‚Äîsomething potential buyers might want to consider.

**Portability and Maneuverability**  
The retractable push-button handle system worked smoothly as I navigated crowded terminals. The self-locking mechanism kept it sturdy, which is essential when you‚Äôre darting between gates. The skate wheels, however, felt hit-or-miss. On even surfaces, these wheels rolled wonderfully. On rough paths, such as cobblestone streets or outdoor terrains, the experience left me wishing for a more robust wheel design.

Inside, the fully-lined interior was a delight‚Äîcomplete with tie-down straps and a meshed zipper compartment that kept items organized. The accompanying tote bag provided just enough room for tech gadgets and essentials, but its lack of durability made it better suited for lighter items only. 

**Strengths**  
- Durable 1200D polyester material with water resistance.  
- Expandable design provides additional packing space.  
- The interior layout includes helpful tie-down straps and extra compartments.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Wheels show instability on uneven surfaces.  
- Zipper durability could be improved for longevity.  

**Target Users**  
Frequent business travelers and weekend explorers will find this carry-on a helpful, budget-friendly companion. Its organizational features and expandability make it ideal for short trips or commutes. It might not satisfy heavy packers or those looking for luxe, high-end luggage, but it certainly hits the mark for practical thinkers seeking affordable quality.

**Peer Products**  
When comparing it to similar budget options like the Samsonite Wheeled Underseater or the Rockland Melbourne Hardside, here's where this carry-on stands out: its lightweight design and added expandability. However, it falls a step behind these competitors in terms of wheel durability and overall aesthetic polish. The Samsonite, for instance, boasts smoother wheels, whereas the Rockland Melbourne Hardside provides enhanced long-term resilience thanks to its hard exterior.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
This carry-on luggage set is undeniably a budget-conscious choice. Whether you're an occasional traveler or someone who values practicality over prestige, this piece gets the job done at a fair price point. Does it rival high-end luggage brands? Not quite. But for those keeping their costs in check, it‚Äôs a perfectly adequate option.

The person I was talking to online turned out to be a guy pretending to be a woman. I was hurt and confused at first, but as I got to know him, I realized he wasn't just pretending to be a woman he was also a furry. And not just any furry, but a furry with a chipmunk fursona.




At first, I was really thrown off. I felt betrayed by the catfishing part, but the furry side of things was just new and different. He invited me to grab tacos (casually, like it was no big deal), and we started hanging out. We‚Äôd do things like drink coffee, watch movies, and sometimes I‚Äôd visit him and play board games with him and his friends (who were also furries). It was awkward at first, but the more we spent time together, the more I found myself just enjoying his company.




Over time, he invited me to a furry convention, and I thought, ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù The whole thing was such a new experience for me, but I ended up having a lot of fun. The first time I went, I didn‚Äôt know what to expect, but there was something about the energy there that felt really welcoming. I kept going to more conventions, and I started meeting a lot of people who were just really kind and genuine. 




Then, at one of the conventions, an artist asked me to spin around for a drawing. It felt kind of weird at first, but when I saw the drawing, I was actually kind of taken aback. They‚Äôd drawn me as a raccoon. I loved it. I‚Äôd never considered a fursona before, but something about the raccoon resonated with me I felt like it fit me in a way I didn‚Äôt expect. Over time, I started to embrace it.




I never imagined I‚Äôd go down this road, but now, I‚Äôm fully embracing my raccoon fursona. It‚Äôs become part of who I am, and I feel so much more connected to this world and my partner. We never really talked about our relationship in a traditional sense, but it just worked. We‚Äôre now dating, and I recently moved in with him. It feels so natural, and I feel so supported and loved by him and the furry community.




So yeah, I went from being catfished by a guy pretending to be a woman, to embracing a fursona and falling in love with him. It‚Äôs honestly one of the most unexpected, sweet journeys I‚Äôve ever been on. Life‚Äôs funny sometimes, but I wouldn‚Äôt change it.




TL;DR: Catfished by a guy pretending to be a woman, found out he was a furry with a chipmunk fursona, and after attending a few conventions, I embraced my own raccoon fursona. We‚Äôre dating now, and I‚Äôm really happy.",2,1745528004.0,confessions,1,0.63,False
1k733wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k733wu/why_should_you_consider_the_imusa_b12042v/,Why should you consider the IMUSA B120-42V stovetop espresso maker review today?,"**A Delightful Stovetop Espresso Companion**

The IMUSA B120-42V has been part of my kitchen routine for a while now, and I must say, this little stovetop espresso maker truly holds its own. Being a coffee enthusiast who‚Äôs tried everything from drip machines to fancy espresso makers, I was curious‚Äîand maybe a touch skeptical‚Äîabout returning to such a classic and simple design. However, this device has proven me wrong in the best way possible. Lightweight, durable, and charmingly retro, it‚Äôs a testament to why century-old designs like this still have a place in modern kitchens.

**Design and Build Quality**

This aluminum espresso maker carries a timeless appearance with its polished silver anodized finish. It‚Äôs compact, barely requiring more than 4.7 inches in width, which makes it an excellent pick for small apartments or for those who don‚Äôt want another countertop giant. The Bakelite handle is a lovely addition, offering a cool and secure grip, even during boiling. Despite weighing only 10.4 ounces, the durability exceeds expectations. On one occasion, my cousin accidentally dropped it while packing for a weekend trip, and yet, there wasn‚Äôt so much as a scratch. Its portability is a delightful bonus, allowing me to easily carry it for camping or cycling adventures where I truly appreciate my coffee.

**Ease of Use and Performance**

Brewing a traditional espresso in just a few minutes sounds like a dream, and the IMUSA espresso maker definitely delivers on that promise. As someone who‚Äôs not a morning person, the simplicity of its operation stands out. Filling the bottom chamber with water, adding 2-3 teaspoons of ground coffee to the funnel, and placing it on my gas stove requires no mental gymnastics‚Äîperfect for groggy mornings.

The manual operation mode might sound like extra work compared to modern push-button machines, but I find it oddly satisfying. I enjoy pouring my brewed espresso through the thoughtfully designed side spout that makes serving a spill-free breeze. Plus, the flip-up top adds convenience, especially when I‚Äôm multitasking in the kitchen.

**Favorable Aspects**

- Small, portable design perfect for kitchens with limited space or on-the-go use.  
- Durable aluminum build that keeps coffee warm without feeling flimsy.  
- Cool-to-touch Bakelite handle and knob ensure safe handling.  
- No electricity required, making it an eco-friendly alternative.  
- Straightforward mechanics that are nearly foolproof.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- While the 3-cup capacity is ideal for espresso, it might disappoint anyone hoping for a larger yield.  
- It‚Äôs recommended to handwash only, which feels tedious after several cups in one day.  
- The aluminum surface, though sleek, tends to lose its shine over time unless cleaned meticulously.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

One area where the IMUSA B120-42V could use improvement is its cleaning routine. Since it‚Äôs hand wash only, scrubbing out coffee residue can get tiresome, especially if you‚Äôve relied on the convenience of dishwasher-safe products before. That said, detaching components for cleaning is fairly easy, and the reusable filter saves me from constantly purchasing replacements. My sister, who borrowed it for a weekend, ignored the cleaning recommendation and popped it in a dishwasher‚Äîdon‚Äôt do this! It loses its sheen and durability if not treated with care.

**Competitive Options**

Comparing the IMUSA stovetop espresso maker to the popular Bialetti Moka Express, I noticed a few distinctions worth sharing. Both succeed in delivering strong and flavorful espresso, but the IMUSA comes at a significantly smaller cost‚Äîan undeniable advantage for the budget-conscious. While the Bialetti boasts more aesthetic detail and a slightly heavier construction, the IMUSA makes up for it with its silicone gasket, which outlasts the Bialetti‚Äôs rubber one that cracks over time. On the downside, the IMUSA‚Äôs exterior doesn‚Äôt maintain its sleek finish as gracefully as the Bialetti over extended use.

Check [Imusa B120-42V](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00164u4dc/) price on Amazon.  

**Affordable Quality**

When you weigh the product‚Äôs price point against the convenience, quality, and nostalgic delight it offers, it‚Äôs hard to see it as anything but a solid deal. Many pricier espresso machines promise similar outcomes but introduce unnecessary complications‚Äîand require dedicated counter space. I can also vouch for the energy savings of not relying on electric brewing. Sure, it might not replace the espresso from high-end machines, but for someone on a budget, this is worth every penny.

1k731yg,https://i.redd.it/5wa558pdiuwe1.jpeg,Anyone have a link to ‚ÄúA MILLION-DOLLAR BETRAYAL: THE TYCOON'S WIFE STRIKES BACK‚Äù?,"At the auction, my husband's assistant accidentally shattered a Bvlgari luxury custom-made bracelet worth a million dollars. 
Without hesitation, he paid the compensation for her.
The assistant bragged on Ins: [Thank you boss for your generosity. I'll work even harder!] 
She then provocatively forwarded this post to me.
After reading it, I just smiled and messaged my husband:
""Heard someone broke a Bvlgari bracelet? How much did it cost?""
""Not much, just small change,"" he replied.
""A million dollars is a small change? Then transfer $3,000,000 to me. Now.""
After a long pause, he finally responded. ""Don't joke around, babe.""
The next second, he received a photo from me.
It showed his most precious PATEK PHILIPPE watch, smashed to pieces.
Worth exactly $3,000,000.

Ethan Pierce's call came through immediately.

""Victoria Reid! Do you realize there are only three of those watches in the entire world? Have you lost your mind!""

""Why are you yelling at me? I think my message was perfectly clear.""

I glanced at the clock on the wall.

""You're already forty-seven seconds late. I'm currently in your car garage. You know the consequences.""

Ethan hung up immediately. Within a minute, I received a notification of a three-million-dollar transfer.

Looking at my newly increased bank balance, a cold smile played on my lips.

I clicked 'Send' on my phone screen and he received another photo I'd prepared‚Äîthe crushed front of his limited-edition Ferrari.

His call came through almost instantly.

""Victoria!!!""

Ethan's voice sounded like it was being squeezed through his teeth. ""Do you have any idea how much money I spent to‚Äî""

""I do,"" I cut him off. ""Three million eight hundred thousand. Air-shipped from Italy just last month.""

""Does it hurt? If it hurts, remember this. I don't want there to be a next time.""

Ethan was too furious to speak. He hung up without another word.

I shrugged. I knew he was angry.

But I didn't care.

Business marriages don't require emotions. If love exists, consider yourself lucky. If not, it doesn't matter.

Ethan and I met through an arranged date three years ago. We were both satisfied with each other's family background and appearance, though not madly in love. So we got married less than six months later.

On our wedding night, we politely went to our separate rooms, even saying goodnight to each other on the staircase.

For a whole year after our marriage, I didn't share a bed with Ethan. When we finally did, it was because we were both drunk.

The Pierce Family‚Äôs auction house was a century-old dynasty, sitting firmly at the top of the auction world. Their family rules were thicker than the Smithsonian's catalog.

My family was a newcomer that had risen in recent years. My father had built his fortune overseas before returning home and establishing legitimate businesses. We didn't have the Pierce family's rigid traditions; we still had something of a street edge to us.

That's why I didn't care whether Ethan truly loved me or not. Neither of us would sacrifice our interests for love.

But this time, this new junior appraiser assistant had stepped on my face with her bragging, and I wouldn't swallow my pride.

I absolutely wouldn't allow anyone to openly take what was mine. Even looking at it wasn't acceptable.

But I knew Ethan wasn't one to swallow his pride either.

Sure enough, that evening I received a message from my best friend Mia.

""Victoria, why did your husband bring someone new to tonight's event?""

I opened my phone to see a photo.

I recognized the background immediately‚Äîit was the Rhine Mansion where the Pierce Family‚Äôs auction house's Merit Hall entertained VIP clients.

Next to Ethan sat a young woman wearing an excessively elaborate dress, looking like someone who had made an extraordinary effort to dress up for her first time at such an event.

I slammed my phone face-down on the coffee table with a loud ""thud."" Mia's messages kept popping up:

[This girl's got nerve]

[She's actually flaunting the bracelet your husband paid for]

[Wait... wasn't that bracelet broken?]

I opened Sophia Morgan's Instagram homepage and saw her recently posted photo.

She was holding Ethan's arm, smiling like a cat that got the cream under the crystal chandelier of the Baccarat.

Caption: [Thanks to Mr. Pierce for bringing me to such a high-class event~]

The most eye-catching part was the Bvlgari luxury custom-made bracelet on her wrist‚Äîthe one that Ethan had supposedly paid a million dollars to replace after she ""broke"" it last week.

I remembered six months ago, when Ethan's previous assistant had merely leaned against him while delivering documents. She was fired the very next day.

What had Ethan said then? ""Pierce Auctions doesn't need employees who don't understand boundaries.""

And now, here he was, indulging a junior appraiser by posting photos together on social media, making sure the whole world knew she was wearing the ""broken"" million-dollar bracelet.

I called Ethan directly.

It rang seven times before going to voicemail.

""Very well.""

A cold laugh escaped me as I pulled up our iMessage thread.

[Mr. Pierce takes a female appraiser to a VIP dinner. Don't you think you owe your wife an explanation?]

I messaged Mia: [Has Pierce checked his phone?]

Mia replied instantly: [He checked his phone but didn't reply. Did you confront him?]

I sent Ethan another message: [Answer me. I know you've seen my message.]

This message was also met with silence.

[I'm giving you one last chance. If I don't see your response in ten seconds, you'll face the consequences.]

Rain began tapping against the window. I walked to my study and took out a yellowed diary from the safe. I snapped a photo and sent it to Ethan.

Sure enough, Ethan replied immediately.

[VICTORIA, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?!]

Mia's message came through right after.

[Wow Victoria, Pierce's face just went white! What did you send him?]

I smiled and sent her a tongue-out emoji: [Just wait for the show!]

The diary belonged to Ethan's first love, Emma Davis. On the frontispiece was a line: ""For sixteen-year-old Ethan, hope you like this gift.""

It contained her diary entries about her crush on Ethan, which she had planned to give him when confessing her feelings.

But before she could confess, she and Ethan were kidnapped. To buy Ethan time to escape, she was tortured and killed by the kidnappers right in front of him.

This diary was the only thing she left behind, and Ethan cherished it more than his own life.

Thinking about this, I suddenly realized that assistant Sophia Morgan bore a striking resemblance to Emma.

I couldn't help but laugh. Ethan was really regressing, playing this disgusting substitute game.

[Don't touch it! We can talk this through!]

Messages came rapidly, showing how anxious Ethan was about the diary.

[Call me. Now.]

The next second, my phone rang.

""Put it on speaker,"" I said calmly.

From the other end came the sound of fabric rustling, then Ethan's suppressed breathing: ""...I'm in a business meeting.""

""I said, PUT. IT. ON. SPEAKER.""

After a moment of silence, the speakerphone tone sounded. In the background, the clinking of glasses suddenly stopped, indicating the entire banquet hall had gone quiet.

""I apologize for the interruption, everyone.""

My voice carried through the phone to that magnificent banquet hall. ""I'm Victoria Reid, Ethan Pierce's wife.""

I could imagine the scene‚Äîthose well-dressed guests holding champagne flutes, looking awkwardly toward the main table.

Sophia Morgan was probably still maintaining that affected smile, though her lips would be trembling by now.

""My husband was supposed to bring me to this dinner tonight, but I never received any notification about it,"" I said methodically, my fingertips brushing the yellowed corners of the diary.

""Victoria, calm down. There's nothing between us, just a normal professional relationship. Don't misunderstand.""

""Really? What kind of boss gives his employee a million-dollar bracelet?""

""I don't care about whatever sordid business you have going on.""

""Now, Ethan Pierce, I want you to slap her. Twice. In front of everyone.""

Gasps could be heard from the other end.

""Have you lost your mind?"" Ethan lowered his voice.

""You can refuse,"" I said, opening the diary to a middle page. ""I believe this page describes the first time she saw you? 'Ethan looked so charming playing basketball. I secretly took a photo and hid it in my diary...'""

""Enough!""

Ethan's voice suddenly grew louder, followed by the sound of hurried footsteps.

""SLAP!""

The crisp sound of a palm striking flesh came through the speaker.

""Ah!"" Sophia's scream was so shrill it made my eardrums ache.

""Continue,"" I said coldly.

""SLAP!!""

The second slap was harder. I even heard something fall to the floor‚Äîprobably that bracelet.

There was dead silence on the other end.

I closed the diary with satisfaction. ""Very good.""

After hanging up, I poured myself a glass of red wine.

I remembered our wedding three years ago. When exchanging rings, Ethan's smile seemed measured to a precise angle.

When our fathers shook hands and spoke of a ""power alliance,"" everyone present understood the unspoken message.

This marriage was never a fairy tale.

He was the perfect heir groomed by the Pierce family; I was the appraisal machine polished by the Reid family. We were like two high-end precious jewelries displayed in a showcase, labeled ""perfect match.""

My phone vibrated. It was a video from Mia.

In the footage, Sophia covered her face as she rushed out of the banquet hall, with an ashen-faced Ethan following behind.

The video ended with a close-up‚Äîthat ""priceless"" bracelet, shattered even more thoroughly than before.

Twenty minutes later, the doorbell rang. Through the security monitor, I saw Ethan standing at the door, his tie askew, his eyes bu//rning with a familiar rage.

I pressed the intercom button: ""Wait.""

Then I turned off the display. Just let him stand in the rain a while longer.

Mia, still relishing the drama, called me.

""That was brilliant! What did you send him? Teach me! I want to learn how to keep my husband in line too!""

I laughed. ""It's nothing special. When you don't care about him, you can control him.""

Hearing this, Mia scoffed: ""Then I definitely can't do it.""

Of course she couldn't. She and her husband had been childhood sweethearts, always stuck together since school. They'd been inseparable and deeply in love for so many years.

""But after what you did to Pierce today, won't he come after you?""

""Come after me?"" I laughed coldly.

""He parades around with Sophia, and I'm not the one causing trouble?""

I heard the sound of the door opening behind me and turned to see a soaking wet Ethan.

His face was grim as he demanded, ""Where's my diary?""

I remained silent, hung up the phone, and stared into his eyes.

He glared back, trying to stare me down, but eventually collapsed onto the sofa in defeat.

""I did what you asked... what more do you want?""

""Did I tell you to humiliate yourself in public? Don't you have anything to explain to me?""

Ethan opened his mouth but said nothing.

""I know what you want to say. You want to tell me there's nothing between you, that everything is innocent.""

""But let me ask you, why did you fire your previous assistant just for leaning against you?""

""You give her a million-dollar bracelet. What do you think that represents?""

""Ethan, you're not someone who doesn't understand the weight of your actions.""

""Your constant indulgence of her is why she dares to challenge me.""

Ethan's expression grew increasingly strained as I pressed on.

""I've seen her resume. She has no experience in appraisal. How did she get a job at the auction house?""

""You're using her to remember your lost love. You've found emotional solace in her. You're reminiscing about your time with Emma through her. Am I right, Ethan?""

Ethan finally lost control of his emotions and buried his face in his hands.

""Victoria, stop... please stop...""

I moved his hands away and cupped his tear-streaked face.

""Ethan, I love you. That's why these things hurt and anger me. Do you love me?""

He whispered softly: ""Yes.""

Satisfied with his answer, I took the diary from a nearby drawer and gently placed it in Ethan's arms.

""I love you, so I would never damage what you cherish most. But similarly, Ethan, my love has limits. Don't disappoint me again.""

Ethan pulled me into a tight embrace, then suddenly pressed me down onto the bed.

A tremor ran up my spine, making me shiver involuntarily. My reaction seemed to excite him. My expensive silk nightgown tore under his hands, and as our bare skin touched, I tasted blood on my lips.

""Remember..."" I gripped the back of his neck, my knuckles white, whispering in his ear between breaths, ""you only get one chance.""

His response was almost violent, a hoarse promise rumbling from his throat:

""There won't be a next time.""

The news that Sophia Morgan had been slapped by Ethan in front of clients spread like wildfire.

Her standing at the auction house plummeted.

No one would say a word to her face, but her increasingly marginalized work assignments and the subtle looks from colleagues made it clear to Sophia that her days of favor were over.

The auction business is all about reading the room. After Ethan unhesitatingly signed her disciplinary report when it reached his office, the ostracism became even more obvious.

Sophia was demoted from appraiser to appraiser's assistant, and along with her position, her salary and benefits dropped too.

Her performance deteriorated day by day, with errors both large and small mounting up, until she finally reached the standard for termination.

Ethan's assistant Jackson took the initiative to send Sophia a termination agreement.

But I never expected she could still pull something off.

Light filtered through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a cold white glow across Ethan's office.

Sophia stood in Ethan's office wearing a white linen dress that clashed with the modern style of the entire office.

The hand-embroidered daisies at the hem were coming loose.

She had spent three nights meticulously recreating this dress, referencing photos of Emma from when she was alive.

""Mr. Pierce...""

Her voice trembled: ""I really don't understand what I did wrong...""

Ethan stood by the window, his back rigid.

Outside, rain fell at an angle, tracing winding tear tracks on the glass. On the desk lay the termination notice just delivered by HR, its bright red seal like an unhealed wound.

""They said... said I don't meet the position requirements...""

Sophia suddenly looked up, tears washing away her deliberately imitated light makeup. ""But just last week you praised I was very professional...""

""You know my mother is still in the hospital...""

Sophia seized the opportunity to grab his sleeve, her nails almost digging into the fabric. ""If I lose my job, her chemotherapy... I'm only coming to you because I have no other options. Please give me a chance to stay.""

Lightning flashed outside the window.

Looking at this face that bore a slight resemblance to Emma, Ethan momentarily found himself back in that warehouse that held his painful memories.

He stormed into Jackson's office, his face ashen: ""Who gave you the authority to interfere with HR matters?!""

""I pay your salary, and you dare use the power I gave you against my people? Have you lost your mind?""

The assistant responded calmly: ""Mr. Pierce, who exactly are 'your people'?""

Ethan's face darkened further as he growled, ""You're fired. Get out now!""

That day, Ethan unleashed his fury on me for the first time.

""Victoria!"" he raised his voice abruptly. ""Do you have to be so ruthless?""

My gemstone appraisal cabinet was overturned completely.

A prized Burmese pigeon-blood ruby rolled across the Persian carpet, and a cutting tool stabbed into the leather sofa.

Ethan approached me, treading through the chaos: ""You think you can control me by smashing a few watches and wrecking a few cars?""

""Let me tell you! Sophia will not be leaving! From today, she's my personal assistant!""

""Don't think that just because we're married, you can do whatever you want!""

With that, he slammed the door as he left.

I watched him go with a blank expression, then crouched down to pick up a sharp piece of glass.

Blood dripped from my palm onto the shattered diamonds, blooming like a flower.

In a struggle to open a window one of shades fall off. After we finished, she get on a coffee table to check the damage. I wasn‚Äôt really  paying  attention to what she was doing - I was distracted by her cat. 

Then suddenly she called out to me, flinging her hands up to the ceiling. I couldn‚Äôt really make out what she was doing exactly, not with the light from window behind her blinding me. 
I froze instinctively wincing, awaiting something to hit my face.  Nothing did she was just pointing at  something at the ceiling. Spider maybe. Doesn‚Äôt really matter. 
She noticed my reaction, jokingly asking: ‚Äûdo they beat you at home?‚Äù. I said no, without even thinking, worrying the casual hangout will be tainted by something heavier no. It didn‚Äôt, she get off the table still chattering, her demeanor as light and cheerful as it was before. I took the moment to gather  myself, I can remember what she was talking about. All  of my energy was focused  on matching her mood.

The funny  thing is , I didn‚Äôt flinch because i was expecting violence. It‚Äôs stupid, but I was reminded of my brother, how he  sometimes tosses plushies or pillows at me. I thought I  was about  to be hit with soft and harmless object. Yet somehow I can‚Äôt stilo thinking about the way I felt in that moment.

So I‚Äôm about to graduate from a RG university and I just completed a vac scheme which I failed to convert into a TC. I am feeling so helpless right now. I did a vacation scheme in my second year and I‚Äôm starting to think that I‚Äôm just not cut out for this. This time round I implemented all the feedback I received, made an effort to schedule coffee chats, contacted trainees before the scheme, I even read on this Reddit page for tips ahead of time. It just feels that I put in everything but it was just not enough. 

Now I‚Äôm going to graduate with no job lined up. I know paralegal and legal admin roles are scarce and hard to find and I‚Äôm honestly feeling so burnt out idk if I‚Äôll be able to churn out applications needed to land a paralegal role. 

I know the average qualification age is 30 and I‚Äôm only 21 so I shouldn‚Äôt be putting so much pressure on myself but I‚Äôm wondering if a career in law is even right for me or if I should switch altogether.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! :)

Our first date was great, we grabbed drinks and talked late into the night. Second date was an activity date. We slept together after that. On our third date we hung out at his. I expressed to him that this wasn‚Äôt just about sex for me, etc. It felt like a great date and we made plans for a fourth.

On our fourth date we went out to a museum, grabbed coffee, grabbed a drink, then went back to mine. We hung out all day, into the night. I told him I was looking for something long term, serious and stable and he said he wanted that too. We discussed our relationship history and the age gap which wasn‚Äôt an issue for either of us. We made plans to see each other again, both in person and over text.

We were texting in the following days and he randomly hits me with the vague ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not feeling the connection I was hoping to feel‚Äù. I said I understood but asked if there were any more specific reasons. He was unable to be more specific and said there were no issues or dealbreakers. It felt like a copy paste message.

It just feels quite late in the game to not feel a connection, especially when all our dates went on for ages and felt great. He was affectionate, there was lots of physical passion, he made efforts to get to know me. I also feel hurt that we were physically intimate when he was unsure if we were on the same page (usually initiated by him).

Fresh off the launch pads at Archimedean Racing Concepts, we‚Äôre proud to unveil the Collector Cards: Second Edition, featuring the adrenaline-fueled misfits of the ARC team.

Built for speed, style, and straight-up ship chaos, these pilots and engineers don‚Äôt just race‚Äîthey define the curve. Whether you‚Äôre trying to complete the set or just find someone who can overclock a junker into a comet, this one‚Äôs got heat.

**In the ARC Set:**

**Voidsnap** ‚Äì The Line Commander ‚Äì Keeps the pack tight through asteroid fields like he‚Äôs conducting an orchestra. A very fast orchestra.

**Phasetoast** ‚Äì The Retrofit Oracle ‚Äì Can turn your busted plasma core into a podium finish. Probably while humming synthwave.

**RCS\_Dancer** ‚Äì The Burnout Virtuoso ‚Äì Punches gravity in the face and still finds time for coffee mid-drift.

**NeonChunks** ‚Äì The Glitchsmith ‚Äì Codes his own boost systems. Sometimes during the race.

**RetroBurnBabe** ‚Äì The Afterburn Artist ‚Äì Makes engines that roar, purr, and leave trails brighter than your future.

**SkipTraceur** ‚Äì The Drift Phantom ‚Äì You don‚Äôt see him coming. You don‚Äôt see him leave. You just see the leaderboard change.

Each card features their signature move, core team role data, and a healthy dose of ARC-brand disregard for structural warranty limits.

This drop is fuel-injected, foil-embossed, and borderline unsafe at any speed.

Overview: I felt pretty much just like me but on my best days (where buckets of dopamine have been bought on the toxic habits market). Thoughts visited my mind as much as ever but did not unpack their luggage. I got everything done I wanted to, and I felt calm and like I had *self confidence* in meetings I sometimes feel nervous of. I did gush to people about things I was interested in at times, and I still made jokes that made people laugh. 
Also, for someone who has been obsessed with crisps/chips my whole life, to literally just not feel like eating snacks is insane. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been throwing shit in the engine all these years just trying to keep the fire going, and today it had actual fuel. It was wonderful, and yet still so subtle. 

For the record I normally function fairly well but feel like I‚Äôm forcing myself to do everything and often feel frustrated or like I don‚Äôt have time to connect with my kids or loved ones. Also worth nothing my period is due in 5 days and normally I would be feeling drained and like I was pushing a huge rock uphill trying to get things done. I‚Äôve felt like this a lot over the last week so although my best days can be good, this wouldn‚Äôt have been one of them!! 

7.30am took my first dose and ate a rare breakfast (my son woke me up an hour earlier than usual so that helped). 

8.30ish I was driving to work and waiting for something to happen. I can‚Äôt describe the feeling because it was incredibly subtle, but I became aware of changes in my body like colder hands and ‚Äòdry‚Äô mouth (actually more like thick spit/textured mouth??). I was sipping away on the water I brought in preparation for this, and I began to cry. 
I think this was me processing the emotions of diagnosis for the first time more than anything else. 

9-1 at work, I wrote my to do list and then just..did it. Not all at once, it took about as long as ever, but there was no dread, no internal pushing, fear, shame, just ‚ÄòI need to do this so I‚Äôll do it‚Äô. It felt *good* to cross the items off, not just like a relief they were done, I felt glad! I wanted to do more! 

I had a tiny slight ache in my head but not bothering me, and my mouth has been fuzzy all day but by this time I‚Äôd drank about 2.5 litres of water vs my normal one coffee before work and then nothing. I was peeing a lot!! 

Lunch break - walked out to my car and thought ‚Äòno‚Äô. Had a 30 minute walk to the store and bought a nuts and grains SALAD for lunch. Normally I‚Äôd buy a bread pretzel, sweets, crisps and god knows what else, probably gone to another store and bought some fun whatever‚Äôs to perk me up. I just bought the salad and felt no desire to look at anything else. 

I walked back to the office and ate my nice lunch, drank more water, and got back to work. I actually had chocolate on my desk but I just didn‚Äôt feel like snacking. 

2-5 at work - afternoon felt slightly less focused, probably because it was literally the worst tasks left but I still felt happy to start them, I just felt like my brain was resisting paying attention a little more. I text my friends a bit in the afternoon but I was mainly just excited to share how well it was going. 

Drive home - felt positive, found myself thinking about a guy I used to get all my dopamine from and made up a little funny blues song about him, made myself laugh. 

6-8.30pm at home alone with my two young kids. This can often be very stressful and I can be irritable at this time of day when they‚Äôre hungry and tired and potentially both crying at once. I made dinner, did all the dishes and cleaned up, and got them to bed. I felt calm, I didn‚Äôt snap at them at all, and I felt more connected in a happy way to them than I normally would on a day/time like this. 

The meds are in theory not working anymore, but I feel calm and still feel like I want to get some more jobs done this evening like laundry.

1k72q9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_uncurv3dbanana/comments/1k72q9e/mouse_band_lore/,mouse band lore,"The fall of cheese
Cheese band is a group of AI generated mice which made their first appearance on January 3rd of 2025 on the @clipmodego account on instagram. The group consisted of four mice, Samuel Swiss, Ethan Wheel, Parmesan Paul, and Marvin Cheese. Often known for interrupting artists or people/ memes in the middle of a video while only performing one song made by Danny Dwyer.
        The Cheese Band was first seen interrupting Nettspend guitar horse, they went on to interrupt bigger artists such as The beatles, Frank Ocean, Tyler the Creator, multiple meme videos and even another band of mice. They were growing fast.
They ran into issues with a group of bugs who had quickly grown as they performed in a similar style to the cheese band and quickly regained the throne.
Controversy broke out between the band as Marvin cheese was suspected to have developed quite an alcoholism issue by bandmates and fans during a world tour in December of 2024 causing samuel smith and ethan wheel to leave the band. They continued to go on tour with replacement mouse Lars Ulrich Briem, Marvin Cheeses brother.
Marvin Cheese went to a rehabilitation center during the tour and was reportedly doing better, but Samuel Swiss and Ethan Wheel had enrolled in coding classes and were beginning to pursue a career change.
Lars faced trouble playing in time with the band with his brother Marvin being away in rehabilitation.[a]
Fans began growing unhappy with the absence of Marvin Cheese and proceeded to boo the band off stage during the world tour. Some fans were even so upset, they went as far as to plant mouse traps in gas stations along the tour path, almost killing one of the band members.
Marvin cheese later made a news appearance, and explained he‚Äôs in conservatorship and is able to leave any time. Thus leading to him making his appearance back on the world tour. This wonderful and highly anticipated surprise uproared riots from the pure excitement of the crowd. Unfortunately he was later described as ‚Äúdistracted‚Äù by his bandmates.Some suspect seeing Marvin Cheese to be drinking again, but Lars was playing better than ever with Marvin Cheese back.
Later, Samuel Smith was spotted and claimed to regret leaving the band and often had a hard time watching tv because of the bands high media presence and turned to vlogging about life as an ex band member and his struggles mentally.
Ethan Wheel was spotted driving for Uber and when asked, he claimed he unfortunately no longer receives residuals from the band.
Meanwhile, Mice Band then starts to collaborate with other artists instead of interrupting them, the first being rick rubin and was rumored that new music would be dropping. We have yet to hear it, And the band continued to post like normal.
 After this announcement, in a video featuring Joshua Block, it came out that Parmesan Paul's divorce with MIchelle Mozzarella had a messy ending. Michelle now gets 50% of the band royalties.
On January 17 it was announced that the cheese band performed at the inauguration, the next day Marvin Cheese was taken into custody for refusing to take a breathalyzer. Fans banded together to fundraise his bail but Marvin declined.
Marvin continued to record videos on a prison tablet for his team to release to fans as the band still performs and interrupts celebrities without Marvin.
Marvin used this jail time for good and was looking stronger and healthier than ever, and after some reflection, Samuel Swiss puts the beef aside and comes to visit his old bandmate. Samuel has been making Cheese Band remixes and gained traction around January 21st 2025 in hopes he could work with Marvin Cheese again.
The Cheese Band started to get cocky without Marvin and claim they, ‚ÄúDon't need the crashout‚Äù, but they were upstaged as it leaked that Marvin has been working on ‚ÄúDon't Forget About Me‚Äù demos, and even made a feature in an interrupted Bob Dylan and the ceo of tiktok with a debut of his new song. He was featured in a few other videos with his new song and even interrupted The Cheese Band's world tour. I guess they didn't lie about the previously mentioned new music!
The rise of Marvin
Since[b] Luigi Mangiones arrest, it was confirmed that Marvin Cheese shared a cell with Luigi and Joe exotic. Marvins clip of his new song is viral at this point and he's been featured in more videos than the band after a controversy of the ‚Äúmice app‚Äù the band developed was plummeting the stock market as it gave anyone the ability to create another AI generated band of mice identical to the cheese band. Making viral videos and fame easily accessible, leading to more people getting more money, crashing the stock market.
Marvin cheese was released from prison on January 28th of 2025 and quickly got back on his feet and bought out the previously mentioned mice app ‚Äúmiceband.com‚Äù this caused an uproar by supporting fans leading to the cheese band canceling recent shows after fans protested in support of Marvin. Although the cheese band‚Äôs going through tribulations, Marvin was on the come up and called Dany Dwyer to converse about buying the copyrights to the cheese band song. Because of this,fans are disappointed as the band is no longer legally allowed to play their iconic sound.
Later, it was leaked that Marvin Cheese secretly performed his ‚ÄúDont Forget Me‚Äù Song live at an intimate corporate event for a sponsorship, leading to a bidding outbreak between labels trying to sign Marvin on with his new song. Shortly after their copyright controversy, press spotted the band's members panhandling on the street, the same day Marvin Cheese was spotted getting coffee with bandmates Parmesan Paul's ex wife, Michelle Mozzarella. Fans argue in comment sections whether Michelle has the right to find love after the divorce no matter the person or if Martin is a bad friend and a backstabber for seeing his former friend and bandmate‚Äôs ex.
A day after the coffee date spotting, Marvins Brother and ex bandmate Lars Ulrich Brie attempted to go visit Marvin since he'd been out of prison for a while and he's yet to see him, but according to certain press articles its said the Marvin ignored Lars‚Äôs calls and knocks on the door, its suspected by Lars that Marvin had a girl over, some fans suspecting it was Michelle. Later, their suspicions were confirmed when the two were spotted together confidently in public again. Parmesan Paul has been visibly unwell, seeing his ex wife get all the media coverage because she's found another, not to mention the other was so close to him.
As Michelle and Marvins relationship got more comfortable, his morals changed and he came out and leaked how the band unethically gained access to viral videos and how they worked the algorithm in their favor. Fans accepted that Marvin had turned a new leaf, he was starting to make mixes and demos in the studio but was having a hard time finding djs that worked with his style,after having many interviews and sessions Marvin contemplated calling Samuel Swiss and ended up doing so. But Marvin was unaware Samuel Swiss had mal intent and was still working with The Cheese Band and had planned on wearing a wire into the studio. He was successful at obtaining tapes without Marvin noticing but they were ineligible.
The Wedding
 After Marvin Cheese's appearance at the Grammys, it was later found out that the relationship between Michelle Mozzarella and Marvin Cheese was stronger than we anticipated as news leaked about an engagement between the two. They were later spotted out in public on a double date with other celebrities such as, Kanye West and Bianca Censori, all the while Parmesan Paul is still going through the feelings from the divorce. he can barely control his hatred for Marvin and has said he's been having wicked dreams about Marvin Cheese. Nonetheless Marvin invites the whole original cheese band to his wedding, the ceremony is beautiful. Bandmates and other attendees noticed Parmasean Paul did not show up. In the wedding video posted we see Parmasean Paul bursting in at the last minute objecting to the wedding, he then went on to go on a long speech about how he still loves her, Michelle Mozzarella actually ends up taking him back,and they ditch the wedding. The two claim the whole divorce was ‚Äúa big misunderstanding‚Äù Marvin being heartbroken, joins the cheese band again and they make a big comeback with a tour and a new song. And even signed a deal that allows the mice to interrupt any meme legally as they please without copyright infringes. But fans are speculating a controversy as they noticed Lars Ulrich Brie and Marvin Cheese still havent spoken since Marvin cheese rejoined.
Adonis Cheese
Just two days after the wedding crash, Parmesan Paul and Michelle Mozzarella are seen arguing and some conclude the divorce was in fact not a big misunderstanding. The kids though are happy their parents are back together again. But unfortunately it all came crumbling down when Michelle Mozzarella finds out she's pregnant, she's worried Marvin Cheese is the father, things are still rough with Paresean Paul so Michelle leaves to meet up with Marvin to discuss plans and ends up ditching poor unsuspecting Paul for two weeks (which is full term for mice). Michelle is gone on valentines day and is later spotted in public with Ted 2 Cool4u and is clearly pregnant.
Michelle, on February 16th 2025 Michelle gave birth to a happy healthy beautiful baby boy, Marvin and Michelle chose to name him Adonis Cheese. The whole band (besides paul) comes to see him, it is then when Marvin cheese steps out for air, when he tries to come back in he gets lost and realizes he's stuck in the backrooms. People still come to support Michelle and worry about Marvins whereabouts.
Saving Marvin
Michelle goes on press with Adonis and informs us about Marvins disappearance on February 19, apparently Marvin began to get comfy where he was so they had to act fast. Elon Musk and the rest of the government curated a plan to get Marvin, they decided to send in the band members. To their surprise Marvin was found in a studio in the backrooms and the group decided to record a demo down there before returning to society. They returned heroically and ready to release the demo they had recorded, but was advised not to by their manager which caused fans to be upset with him.
The band signed with a new label on February 25th and planned on booking a second world tour.
The end (for now)
Unfortunately during this time, an entity named ‚Äútuff bear"" had been on the uprising, the band got less traction and stopped headlining the news, due to this some updates from here on out may have plot holes and time skips.
Parmesan Paul one day gained consciousness and realized he's AI generated, so he started trying to live normally and had been spotted around town at expensive millennial burger shops, and was seen leaving the kids with his mom. Later we find out this was so he could move to New York City to start over after the turmoil with Michelle. His plans are spoiled as he's informed that Marvin Cheese's cousin Tim Cheese wasn't happy about him leaving and claims unfinished business with Marvin. Although Marvin is just excited his son, Adonis, is starting to show interest in music already.
        As the bands popularity depleted, they started getting less and less media coverage and unfortunately this is the furthest information available on the clipmodego account. Currently ‚ÄúTuff bear‚Äù has the podium for fame and continues to outshine the band, fans plead in comments for the return of the band but for now we can only wait and pray for the safety of everyone.

The call came from the kitchen, Rachel's voice carrying through the thin walls of our house. Hauling myself out of bed, I hurried down to find out what had pissed her off enough to wake me up. I found her standing in the light of the open fridge pulling out a dripping mass from the bottom shelf with a finger and thumb, careful not to get any liquid on the fabric of her coat.

'James you told me that you'd cleaned the fridge out!' She said, holding up the rotten lump like an accusation.

I couldn't deny it. After days of nagging I'd given in yesterday and told her that I'd done it, hoping that she'd not try and look before her business trip. Obviously that hadn't worked, and now I was staring at the floppy carrot of consequences. I thought fast. 

'No babe, I meant that I'd get it sorted today! While you're away, I'll clean it all out, scrub it clean and get fresh food in, promise! I just didn't want to waste our last evening together doing it.'

She wasn't buying it. With an expression colder the fridge she threw the offending vegetable away, then crossed back over to pick out her lunchbag. As she did she let out a cry of disgust before thrusting it out towards me.

'What the hell is this, James?!'

I looked at the thin brown slime staining the side of her bag, and the small, sad potato that clung grimly on to the organic glue. I briefly considered actually guessing what the substance was, but luckily some sense of self preservation kicked in at the last moment.

'My fault babe, it's my fault, I'm sorry.' I said quickly, plucking the semi-rotten tuber off Rachel's food bag and reaching for the kitchen roll. 'Let me sort it.'

'It's foul James, it's just foul.' She said as I did my best to de-slime her lunch.'

'...And it's not what you need just before you leave, I know, I know.' I finished for her, zipping up her lunch bag and offering it back to her. 'I'll fix it babe, I promise.'

She sighed, and I saw her frustration deflate a little. 'You better. There's something furry on the middle shelf, and the vegetable drawer is like War of the Worlds.'

With that we got the last of her bits together, and I gallantly wheeled her suitcase to the front door. 

'You've got four days James. Don't let me down, okay? I'll call you when I'm at the airport.' She said, giving me a quick peck on the lips. Her coat buttons pressed into the bare skin of my belly.

'Trust me babe, I'll get it done.' I said, giving her one last squeeze as she stepped outside.

Half-hiding myself behind the door I waved her off, watching her car disappear over the hill towards the airport. The moment it was gone I turned back towards the bedroom, private browsing on my mind and the fridge already forgotten.

***
Five hours later I wandered into the kitchen for a drink. With my eyes on my phone I didn't see the open fridge door until I'd already headbutted it and sent it bouncing off the counter. I stumbled back and slipped on something cold and slimy, sending me crashing down to the linoleum floor. 

'What the fuck!' I shouted at nothing in particular.

As the pain receded from my forehead and tailbone I opened my eyes and took stock of what had happened. The fridge door was open, the motor inside letting out a chunky-sounding whine, and hanging limply at eye level was a thin, meaty-looking string of some sort. It was looped over the milk in the fridge door, and led all the way down to the bottom of my sock where whatever I'd stepped on was still soaking through. With a faint sense of horror I turned my foot towards me, and saw the remains of a potato the length of my thumb mushed into the fabric. 

'Oh that's fucking gross...'

Wincing I peeled the half-brown mass off the sole of my foot which disturbed the root or shoot, whatever it is that rotting potatoes grow, and the freezing cold length of it collapsed flaccidly onto my chest and neck. I spasmed in repulsion, flailing at it to get it off my skin as if it was a rubbery spider web, sending it flopping onto the floor. Another shiver went through me and I pulled myself painfully to my feet.

Inside the fridge, from a bag of potatoes that I'd bought with the best of cooking intentions, was a bulging mass of thin red strands bursting from the plastic like the questing tendrils of some demonic fungus. A few were like wispy hair, while others were as thick as my little finger with growths and knuckles jutting off the sides. The sheer volume of them had pushed the vegetable drawer open, and presumably the fridge door with it, spilling out the rotten spud I'd slipped on. For a few moments I just stared at the tentacles of plant matter, mind trying to wrap itself around what I was seeing, before I suddenly decided to slam the door shut. The fridge light disappeared, and with it the disgusting sight.

'Nope. Nu-uh, not tonight.' I said to myself, kicking the wet stalk of the crushed potato away from me. 

Cramming the fridge door shut I turned and walked out of the kitchen. I knew the cleaning job would get worse the longer I left it of course, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Once I'd nursed my aching tailbone I'd get right on it. I still had three days after all.

***
It was the early morning when the noise woke me. The unreality of my dream still clung to me as I surfaced, confused about what had disturbed me. The fan from my PC hummed gently to itself, but there was another sound hiding behind it as if hoping to sneak past unnoticed. I closed my eyes, hoping that whatever it was would sort itself out and I could go back to sleep, but then I heard it again. Something moving downstairs.

Much more awake at that. Realising how alone I was, I climbed out of bed and padded towards the stairs listening as hard as I could, missing Rachel's comforting presence and feeling exposed and foolish. The sound came again, the soft noise of something small shifting about. My mind moved from intruders to rats, and I let out a hiss through clenched teeth. If we have rats then it'll be Rachel's last staw. There was no choice, I had to go and see. Blearily I shuffled down to the living room and began shining my phone light around the place searching for any hint of rat activity, whatever that would look like. The coffee table knick-knacks were undistubed, no signs of fur or tiny teeth marks in the furniture, but then the torchlight caught the edge of something shiny.

It was a trail of slime, about as thick as my thumb, coming from under the armchair over the carpet, and leading to the open kitchen door. Beyond that I could see the sickly yellow light from the open fridge illuminating the countertops, and again came the distressed whine of the motor trying to cool the open machinery. I stopped, taking in the scene. Can rats open fridges?

I bent to examine the slime. It was brown and glistened wetly under the white light of my phone, spread in a thin layer that gave off the smell of rotting plants. It looked cold, though I didn't dare touch it. I followed it across the living room and into the kitchen, where the trail ended at the base of the humming refridgerator. That wasn't what shocked me though, what made me stop to take a breath was that from the innards of the fridge spilled out a knotted red tangle, the wet sprouting roots of the potatoes now dangling out like the gutted intenstines of the appliance. A number of the brown things had rolled out onto the floor, lank roots splayed out like spider's legs.

'Oh fuck that. Fuck that...' I whispered to myself, backing out of the horrific kitchen scene.

Without looking where I was going though I stepped in the trail of slime on the living room floor, the slick substance cold against my bare skin. I stifled a yell but managed to drop my phone, which bounced off the carpet and landed flash-side down, leaving me with nothing but the ambient light coming from the kitchen to see by. Stunned by my own incompetence and gritting my teeth from the revolting substance on my sole, I sat for a moment, torn between crossing the room in the dark for the lightswitch, or simply fumbling under the chair for my phone. As I stood there stupidly in the pitch black though I heard that sound again. A soft, almost squelchy noise, and realised with horror that it was coming from directly above me.

Slowly I knelt and pawed at the floor for my phone, not moving my gaze away from the patch of darkness above me that had made the noise. I wanted to move, to back away from whatever this thing was., but I found my feet rooted to the spot as if I was under the gaze of some consealed predator that would pounce should I turn and run. I wasn't even considering that it was rats any more, rats don't climb walls. I didn't know what I was afraid of, all I knew was that it was the primal fear fear of something dangerous in the dark. Finally, my fingers found the rubber of my phone case, and I jerked back up, clutching it like a talisman.

For a moment there was nothing. The room was empty, silent, full of sharp shadows in the unforgiving flash of my phone. Then I pointed it upwards, following the slime trail up the wall, the horror inside me growing as I realised that it tracked across the ceiling until there I saw it. Right above my head and suspended by four girthy red roots, was a baking potato.

It came to a shivering halt in the white spotlight. Soft brown spots covered its beige surface, the forgotten vegitable half-rotten. Each of its glistening tendrils must have been at least two feet long, and they clung to the popcorn ceiling with hair-like protrusions that burgeoned from their rooty length. For a moment my mind ground uselessly against the sight like a misaligned gears, the absurdity too much to bear. Slowly, the flattest surface of the potato came to rest facing me. I had just a single moment to remember _potatoes grow towards light!_ before the roots detached, one by one, and the monstrous thing fell on me.

Immediately the cold, hard sprouts wound around my face and body. Somewhere between flesh and wood they began immediately to squeeze, the sheer power of them shocking. The potato itself landed directly on my face, hitting my nose like a fist and latching on. Already I was scrabbling, pulling at the stringy roots and shouting inchoherantly. The spout around my neck took advantage of my open mouth and shot the tip of its tentacle in, hairy protrusions searching for my spit and sucking my tongue dry in seconds. Horrified I bit down, and was rewarded by the fibrous thing thrashing as my teeth ground against the tough plant matter.

Two red roots wound around my wrists, binding them together as I attacked the potato itself. My first thought had been to crush the damn thing, but beyond sinking a finger an inch into a mushy spot the rest held firm. I'd forgotten how hard a raw potato was, and now I was losing a fight to one. Desperately I lurched to the kitchen, slipping my way across the slimy linoleum towards the kitchen knives. A second set of roots wound around my ankle as I went, painfully tight, and the weight of another potato bounced against my foot as I grabbed for the largest plastic handle in the block. The potato on my face was choking me with its thin red tendrils, and so unable to attack it properly I engaged in an exaggerated two-handed shaving-motion, swiping the blade parallel to my cheeks to avoid stabbing myself and doing the demon tuber's work for them. The cheap blade barely bit, the dull metal finding its match in the thick potato skin and only cutting off thin chips intead of the butchery I needed.

Scuttling sounds from all around now, shadows moving within shadows from every wall and surface in the kitchen. There must have been half a dozen, all alerted by the moisture of my body and ready to attack. I suddenly felt a third vegitable land hard against my back, its ropey sprouts looping around my throat and instantly beginning to crush. The one around my ankle managed to lash my other leg, binding them together and sending me crashing to my kitchen floor. Mercifully I didn't fall on the knife, but the impact knocked it from my hands and sent it spinning out of reach. It had only been a few moments, but already my vision was darkening around the edges as I thrashed on the floor, managing nothing more helpful than kicking the sink cabinet off its hinges.

_I'm going to die. Murdered by posessed potatoes that tied me up on my own kitchen floor..._

They were closing in then, the unearly sound of potatoes coming in for the kill the last thing I would ever hear. The room was full of squirming red ropes. My thoughts become less coherant as my brain ran out of oxygen, and as my kicking became more feeble my heel caught something that spun up my body and landed behind my neck. A cool, trickling sensation spread across my bare skin.
_Goopy_  Was the last thing my mind offered me as I slipped beneath the darkness...

All at once consciousness came rushing back. I sat up, cough-screaming as the tendrils around my neck suddenly released. My hands were still bound near my face and the second potato had my ankles in an iron grip, but the one that had been strangling me was thrashing wildly in a small puddle of blue goo like a demented spider. Its tendrils whipped wildly around before the potato finally shuddered and fell still.

Blinking stars from my eyes I tried to take in what had happened. Something had gotten onto the demonic thing, something that had finally killed it. Then the smell hit me. Bleach! It was bleach, the bottle that I'd lost the cap to months ago! Looking around wildly I found the bottle lying on its side and dove for it just as a large jacket potato pounced on my chest.My hand clasped the bottle as I landed, the dreaded thing squirming beneath me. Two more impacts on my back, but I focused on jamming the nozzle under my chest and blasting the blue gel onto the wretched potato. With a shudder it fell still, though slick roots were now winding around my chest and arms from behind. I gripped the bottle of bleach and let out a defiant scream, spraying a blue stream blindly over my left shoulder until I felt the grip slacken.

Two more scuttling towards me. My hand was slipping aginst the floor, skidding out from under me as I tried to rise, leaving me staring up at the potatoes that were bearing down on me like giant spasmodic insects. I managed to bring the bottle up and hit the first with a jet, sending it tumbling fowards with its flaccid roots across my neck. The second was on me though, binding my wrist and squeezing so hard I swore it was going to snap. I just barely got the nozzle against the thing and squeezed. With the sound of a wet fart the bottle blasted the last of its bleach into the beige monster, and it fell still. 

Silence and stillness. My nose and skin burned with the chemicals, and I slowly pulled myself to my knees. A pale root slid limly from my shoulder and plopped onto the floor. I took a deep, shuddering breath. 

Within a heartbeat I felt tendrils wrap around my head, the potato against my mouth, quivering hairs reaching for the moisture in my eye. With a yell I did the only thing I could think of and wrapped my bleach-covered hands around the wretched thing to pull. It shuddered and squirmed beneath my slimy grip. For a moment it seemed that it would get me, I could feel something wriggling under my eyelid, when all at once the potato skin gave way. I crushed it , mash spewing out between my fingers as I let out a roar of triumph! At last, the whole lot of them were dead.

After I'd collected myself I stood and shut the fridge door, finally giving the straining motor some rest. Switichg on the main light I surveyed the carnage. Brown slime and blue bleach covered every surface, and even some bright  spots of my blood. Half-mangled potatoes lay everywhere, their limp red roots trailing like the hair of murder victims on the wet linoleum. I let out a sob, not sure what else to do, and following my instincts went to turn and go to bed, hoping to forget this whole thing.
Something stopped me though. Whether it was guilt or simple self-preservation I found myself stopping and turning on the kitchen light. In a daze I went to the sink and wiped the worst of the bleach off me before grabbing cloths and a bin bag and beginning to clean. All the dead potatoes were cleared away, the surfaces wiped, the floor made spotless. I even sorted the fridge, wiping out the last of the slime left by the veggie hoard. By the time I finished the sky outside was being bruised by the first hint of Sunlight, but as I stood at looked at the spotless kitchen I felt a real sense of pride.

'Shower.' I muttered to mysefl. 'Shower, then sleep...'

The thought of calling the police trundled through my mind as I climbed upstairs, but I dismissed it. What would I even say? Instead I pulled out my phone to message Rachel. She'd be in her hotel by now, and even if she didn't believe me she'd find it funny and be happy the kitchen was clean. Opening the app and was surprised to see a message waiting for me already, and smiled as I opened it. What I read though made my blood turn cold.

_'Hi babe, arrived safe. Hope the cleaning is going well! Not happy with you though, I just got to the hotel and found a mouldy old potato in my lunch bag! I still love you but we're having words when I get back x'_

With shaking fingers I dialled her number, memories of a slimy beige object in the open zip of her bag materialising in my mind. The phone rang, and rang, and rang.",2,1745526961.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The call came from the kitchen, Rachel's voice carrying through the thin walls of our house. Hauling myself out of bed, I hurried down to find out what had pissed her off enough to wake me up. I found her standing in the light of the open fridge pulling out a dripping mass from the bottom shelf with a finger and thumb, careful not to get any liquid on the fabric of her coat.

'James you told me that you'd cleaned the fridge out!' She said, holding up the rotten lump like an accusation.

I couldn't deny it. After days of nagging I'd given in yesterday and told her that I'd done it, hoping that she'd not try and look before her business trip. Obviously that hadn't worked, and now I was staring at the floppy carrot of consequences. I thought fast. 

'No babe, I meant that I'd get it sorted today! While you're away, I'll clean it all out, scrub it clean and get fresh food in, promise! I just didn't want to waste our last evening together doing it.'

She wasn't buying it. With an expression colder the fridge she threw the offending vegetable away, then crossed back over to pick out her lunchbag. As she did she let out a cry of disgust before thrusting it out towards me.

'What the hell is this, James?!'

I looked at the thin brown slime staining the side of her bag, and the small, sad potato that clung grimly on to the organic glue. I briefly considered actually guessing what the substance was, but luckily some sense of self preservation kicked in at the last moment.

'My fault babe, it's my fault, I'm sorry.' I said quickly, plucking the semi-rotten tuber off Rachel's food bag and reaching for the kitchen roll. 'Let me sort it.'

'It's foul James, it's just foul.' She said as I did my best to de-slime her lunch.'

'...And it's not what you need just before you leave, I know, I know.' I finished for her, zipping up her lunch bag and offering it back to her. 'I'll fix it babe, I promise.'

She sighed, and I saw her frustration deflate a little. 'You better. There's something furry on the middle shelf, and the vegetable drawer is like War of the Worlds.'

With that we got the last of her bits together, and I gallantly wheeled her suitcase to the front door. 

'You've got four days James. Don't let me down, okay? I'll call you when I'm at the airport.' She said, giving me a quick peck on the lips. Her coat buttons pressed into the bare skin of my belly.

'Trust me babe, I'll get it done.' I said, giving her one last squeeze as she stepped outside.

Half-hiding myself behind the door I waved her off, watching her car disappear over the hill towards the airport. The moment it was gone I turned back towards the bedroom, private browsing on my mind and the fridge already forgotten.

***
Five hours later I wandered into the kitchen for a drink. With my eyes on my phone I didn't see the open fridge door until I'd already headbutted it and sent it bouncing off the counter. I stumbled back and slipped on something cold and slimy, sending me crashing down to the linoleum floor. 

'What the fuck!' I shouted at nothing in particular.

As the pain receded from my forehead and tailbone I opened my eyes and took stock of what had happened. The fridge door was open, the motor inside letting out a chunky-sounding whine, and hanging limply at eye level was a thin, meaty-looking string of some sort. It was looped over the milk in the fridge door, and led all the way down to the bottom of my sock where whatever I'd stepped on was still soaking through. With a faint sense of horror I turned my foot towards me, and saw the remains of a potato the length of my thumb mushed into the fabric. 

'Oh that's fucking gross...'

Wincing I peeled the half-brown mass off the sole of my foot which disturbed the root or shoot, whatever it is that rotting potatoes grow, and the freezing cold length of it collapsed flaccidly onto my chest and neck. I spasmed in repulsion, flailing at it to get it off my skin as if it was a rubbery spider web, sending it flopping onto the floor. Another shiver went through me and I pulled myself painfully to my feet.

You will need to buy a pack of safety razors, which will set you back about ¬£6 for 100, so good value, and then when you get a coffee next time from your local coffee shop, ‚Äòborrow‚Äô a few extra wooden stirrers and then thread them through the holes of the razor blade at the top and bottom. 

Do take care with your finger tips as the blade will be very (very) sharp, so either hold it with a  cloth or some long nose pliers so the blade bends still.

There I am, finishing my yogurt boat minding my business when a guest calls me over. He asks to speak with my manager and I ask why. He grabs a small plastic bag, one used to hold the produce, from out of his pocket and says, and I kid you not, ""I took this bag and farted in it. Like held it there and farted. I let it rip inside this bag and then smelled it. It was the most awful smell, just like shit. It smelt so bad."" It was all I could do to nod and agree that the fart filled bag indeed probably smelt awful, but the guest wasn't done. ""I kept this bag with me for three days straight, and everyday I sniff it and everyday it smells like fart. Do you want to smell?"" I tell the guest in the most polite way possible that fuck no I don't want to smell the shit bag, when he holds it up to my face and practically shoves it to my nose.

1k72n4x,https://i.redd.it/7lxgdo5bfuwe1.jpeg,April Vlog,"-Vlog starts off with her running errands. She says that she has all day to do that since she doesn‚Äôt have anything else going on, aside from needing to edit 2 hours of vlog content. It‚Äôs a total of 10 minutes of her going in and out of her car, narrating what she bought while doing errands, ordering and eating a sandwich for lunch.

-She shows all of the crap she got from Sephora. 

-Her content for Quince is due the next day so she‚Äôs going to go out to a cute coffee shop to shoot that content. Her mom offered to meet her to help her shoot the content but she said she could do it herself, if there aren‚Äôt a lot of people there and she doesn‚Äôt feel embarrassed to pull out her tripod. She ended up going to a different coffee shop and says she wants to see how cute and photo worthy it is in there. Some closeup footage of her typing on her laptop while in the coffee shop. 

-After, she says that she‚Äôs proud of herself for getting it done on her own. The hardest part of the job is taking photos in person by herself. She‚Äôs not embarrassed when she‚Äôs with other people, but she knows that people are laughing at her or making fun of her. She starts rambling about how she doesn‚Äôt care what people think because she gets paid to ‚Äúcreate content.‚Äù She mentioned a group of high school girls who were giggling at her inside the coffee shop and then spots them again while she‚Äôs inside her car.

-Went to therapy, went to a wedding, cooked dinner with her family for Nick and her nephew‚Äôs birthdays.

-More filming of try on hauls. She says that she organizes the clothes for her try ons by brand/reel (I feel like this is just obvious?). She set up her tripod to film the reel and then another tripod to film her filming the reel. (My god, the self importance.)

-She talks about getting her nails done with her mom (can probably guess who paid for that). She wants a fun color that will make her feel happy when she‚Äôs looks at them.

-Reading, feeding the cats, working out, nail appointment. 

-She goes to a wax appointment. Was scared about it beforehand and apparently didn‚Äôt handle it well during it.. almost asked them to stop halfway through. She rewards herself with Starbucks.

-Went to Gap, shows all the clothes she bought. Records herself reading outside by the pool. Then folds laundry. Unpacks a suitcase full of clothes from their move so she can pack for their trip. Ordered pizza for dinner.",3,1745526783.0,CTInfluencerSnark,3,1.0,False

I finished a final round interview on Thursday before the Easter Weekend. It was a short conversation with the senior partner, who said they‚Äôd be in touch by end of this week.

While it‚Äôs hard to tell, they told me a number of times throughout that they were impressed with my answers, we seemingly got on well (joking conversation) - and they were typically very proactive in communicating next steps and selling the company.

I had this regular named Gary that came in twice a day for his 12oz mocha - no lid. He was probably late 80's? He was usually the first customer of the day and then again later in the afternoon. Got his drink and then went outside to smoke his cigarette. I'm talking daily routine. If we didn't see or hear from him for longer than a day, we would have other regulars keep their eye out on him. We would ask the closer to text us to make sure he came in. 

He would meet his kids and grandkids almost every sunday at the shop. His kids (late 40's/early 50's) would thank all of us employees all the time. We were his friends. He was the shop mascot. Retired military. We. Love. Him.

Found this poem that he had written me for my birthday. My son was just born (September) and my birthday is in October. 

That son is now almost 10 years old. I'm almost 37.

(I'm starting to cry now. I need to stop crying to Reddit.)

I think about this regular allllll the time. I've always wondered where or if he is still alive. I saw this guy twice or more a day for 6ish years. He was there when a lot of weird stuff was happening in my life. And he was always there to ask/talk about it. 

I've been working in coffee for 15+ years. This man is a pillar in my coffee career.

It reads:

**Happy Birthday, Max**

Of all the people that I have known,  
One stands out ‚Äî just he alone.

Making his way and measuring up,  
Greets, collects, and fills the cup.

I know not from whence he sprung,  
But when born, an angel surely sung.

Love filled his heart to ‚ÄúMax‚Äù-imum  
When his eyes beheld his life‚Äôs premium.

And the gentle hands of dearest one  
Gifted Max with a handsome son.

His presence: confident, dignity, serene,  
Such barista-ness I have never seen.

This sonnet now has reached its end.  
I dedicate it to my friend.

Also, is there any particular bean you like from a given roaster?

I like Ohori in Santa Fe's dark roasts but wasn't that impressed with their lighter stuff, especially compared to what a friend of mine who's a roaster in NC has sent me where I really get cherry, honeysuckle etc... flavors. Thinking I might try Iconik's lighter roasts since I've had good coffee at their cafe's before. 

I'm using an NZ and an old La Pavoni napolitana (similar to a domus bar) machine. It requires some temp surfing, but I have it figured out pretty consistent, and I weigh in and out, time shots, and WDT. So conical burrs, not getting crazy clarity or anything where I can justify buying the absolute fanciest beans out there.

Lastly, what price should I expect to pay for good beans? $20/10oz feels a little steep to me, but I know people are out here spending $40 on like 4oz of gesha and I'm fine to pay for quality that's a cut above the $20/lb I get at ohori.

1k72es2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1k72es2/my_wife_may_be_cheating_on_me_she_has_a_horrible/,"My wife may be cheating on me, she has a horrible temper but I love her when she isn't being terrible. Should I divorce her now or try to save our marriage? Or wait to divorce her in 3 yrs when our youngest graduates high school? Any advice is appreciated.","I've (45M) been married to my wife (37F) for 11 years with a teen daughter and an adult stepson. I travel around the country as a contractor for work, oftentimes gone for several weeks. I do try to make it home at least once a month and holidays if my work schedule/finances permits. I am the primary breadwinner, wife works part time. We keep separate bank accounts but I have not denied her any money. She can access my account and get money at any time without having to ask. We rent a house and currently I have 13k in cc debt, 50k IRS debt, 7k in the bank but a lot of that is for rent/essentials and now I am thinking maybe for a divorce lawyer. My work is unsteady so there are periods where I am on unemployment. I feel like my wife uses me for my money.

I miss my family but when I am coming home, I feel a mixture of happiness and dread over whether my wife will be in a good or bad mood. Pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the weekend or holiday.

We've thrown around the word 'divorce' during arguments over the last few years. I do love her. I feel so depressed that divorce is really on the table. But I am feeling like I am reaching my limit and cannot do this anymore. Sick of all the drama and her controlling behavior/attitude, of being belitted and carrying more of the mental/financial/physical load for our family, walking on eggshells around her cause anything could cause her to get angry/meltdown. Sick of being goaded into being angry and feeling like I do not have support from my 'partner'.

More background: My wife was/is mostly a SAHM. She currently works part time as a makeup artist, like 12-16 hours a week, about 4 hours a day. This was great when the kids were younger and everything was cheaper. Now one is an adult and the other is old enuff to stay home without a babysitter. I have no clue what she is doing with her time when not working besides giving a ride to and from school, cooking, kids sports club, and the gym.

She has acted out before marriage but we had a child and she kept asking 'when are you going to make an honest woman out of me?' I thought she was the love of my life so I married her. Her behavior has gotten worse as the years go by. I think I am pretty easy-going, but she constantly pushes to the point where I feel like I need to speak up then usually pretty ugly at that point. I used to date a woman for years and we hardly ever fought. Over the course of 5 years, we fought like twice and was nothing compared to what I go thru 4-5x a year with my wife. And I could tell her things and not feel judged. I have wished that easiness with her could be there with my wife.

Some examples of our interactions:

* I asked her years ago to pay the household bills from my account. She just needed to write the check and send it off in the mail. She agreed. Things went well for several months then suddenly I was notified of a large balance in a utility bill. Apparently, she started only paying a partial amount of the bill when the energy usage increased, the next month the balance rolled over, and she got 'scared' and again only paid a partial amount. Over and over until I got notified. She couldn't even TELL me there was an issue/a balance, had to find out from the utility company. Tried to explain to her we needed to pay off the full amount cause we need to heat the house but she freaked out so I had to take over paying most of the bills. When I say pay, I mean just write out checks, not actually use her money to pay. Yes I know my money is 'our money' but it's not same with her. Her money is HER money, I don't know how much she has nor have I ever asked. Currently I pay a majority of the bills -insurance/medical/food/IRS/credit cards/cell phones/internet/subscriptions/rent for house and pay for motel/hotel where I stay for work. She pays (with her own money) the gas for car and utilities for gas and water bills which totaling around $150/month. She has never once offered to contribute more to the bills.
* Years ago when times were tough, I was overwhelmed by the amount of bills, credit card debt owed etc, basically getting to the point where I was barely making the payments on time. I tried to open up and talk to my wife about it. A healthy discussion of our finances, how the bill amounts were so high, what could we do to lower them or if she could contribute more? I was already working as much overtime as I could get. Was the first time I broke down crying when I told her about the difficulty and she patted my arm and said, ""I know you'll find a way"". That was it. No other support. Delivered in a tone of voice that I think was meant as supportive but nothing actionable. She did absolutely nothing to help out more. I feel like an ATM machine, a niggling feeling I've had that she married me for money and a cushy lifestyle. Which is hilarious considering we would have a much better lifestyle if she didn't destroy things (totaled 2 cars>raised car insurance rates, bought her a used car to replace, I'm paying off her car and mine). I work and work and it's like she forgets that I also need to pay for a hotel, gas, food for myself. That she has no clue about the finances and unwilling to learn or make more of an effort to manage the household.

She keeps poking at me, harassing me until I reach my limit and explode back at her.

* I was driving and she was in the passenger seat, kids in the back. She went off for two hours, screaming at me at the top of her lungs about how horrible a person I was, I don't care about her feelings, I don't take care of her, etc until I had enough. I had been silent the entire time, waiting for her to tire out and the explosion that commenced was like, 'Shut the fuck up you bitch! You will not speak that way to me again or I'll pull over to let you out right here' but waay harsher but that worked and she finally shut the fuck up. Not my finest moment but what would you do? In the past, I have threatened and gone through with telling her to gtfo of the car and leaving her one time but I turned around a block later and picked her back up.

She constantly puts me down/emasculates me in front of our children, her mother, her friends (we dont have many mutual friends anymore because I don't have any friends anymore) Wife, kids, me and my MIL were in the car. Wife wanted to buy me a bag of candy when we stopped. I replied No thanks. To which she got excessively angry than she should have been for someone who had been told no thank you to your generous offer for candy. without me saying all the dang words but that was the intention. Wife called me a bloated fat piece of shit (which I find weird). Everyone else was silent. My response was 'I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment' and we drove back home in silence. MIL seemed pleased that her daughter was treating me this way.

I may have been checking a chick out at the gym. She yelled and screamed at me in the gym, until we left the gym and headed to the car. Where she screamed some more and threatened physical violence to me 'i should smack the shit out of you right now' and 'you're a small dick bald fat loser that nobody would want to fuck'.

But she has never once shown this full blown crazy behavior in front of my parents. They would confront her and I think she knows this. She mostly behaves herself in front of them but has shown huffiness and gets pissy and soft whisper yells at me behind closed doors when we visit. She says they hate/dislike her, but they have never once mentioned this. My personal feeling is they probably do not care for her but they just wouldn't say anything negative because they know how much I love her. They have treated her warmly as family. It's not like they give her the cold shoulder at family gatherings.

She goes between showing me affection and saying things like 'don't touch me!'. It is like dr Jekyll and mr hyde. We went on a mini weekend trip and at the time we met up, I was dreading who is going to greet me, my wife or this other crazy person I want to divorce? She has ruined so many vacations that I vowed never to go on real vacation with her again because I will never be able to relax and enjoy it.

She does not want me to touch her at the gym. No affection at all when she is ok with affection in other public places. I am not talking about anything inappropriate, more like she doesn't want any touch at all. I am starting to think she is seeing someone at the gym or that person is at the gym when I go with her. And maybe she lied to him and told him we were separated or something so touching her would mess up her story? I feel like I am overthinking. If we go to the grocery store, hand holding, light butt grab, give her a hug all ok. Or maybe it's because it's the gym and we are sweaty but she has said this as we are entering the gym before any sweating has occurred.

Family board game night, more often than not, has ended in disaster. Talking about she is board flipping mad, 'this game is stupid I'm done with this shit!' because she is losing. Or she is bored and doesn't want to play anymore. So none of us get to continue to play. womp womp. game nite over.

Every year, she drags her feet to get paperwork ready for filing our taxes jointly. Some years she never produced the paperwork so we did not file and that's why we have so much IRS debt that I keep paying off and every year they keep coming back asking for a larger amount. She's never participated in paying off the taxes.

Years ago, she started her weight loss journey. I joined her about a year later, she accused me of placing my body first before the family. I was doing something that she was not a part of and it's weird because she initially wanted me to get an instagram acct but I know it will cause a problem because she has said 'if there are women on the instagram acct she doesn't know how she'll feel about that' but I know she would flip out.

When I succeeded in losing a large amount of weight, instead of her congratulating me on reaching my goal, she cried, ""what about me?! What will I do?"" Like I was gonna leave her a$$ for some younger chick. I've been self conscious of my appearance most of my adult life and losing all the weight and looking fit I do feel more self esteem.

Wife is so \_\_\_\_\_\_? that she won't do the dishes properly. She leaves the plates, pans, utensils on the floor so the dogs can lick it up. So fking disgusting but after trying different tactics like how unhygienic it is, not normal, I don't want to eat using these plates and utensils so pls respect my boundary. She refuses to stop. I have accepted this by eating out as much as possible when I come home. Is it normal? I don't think so but I am open to other opinions. And MAYBE I would be more receptive to it if the plates/utensils were actually washed, by the time she loads them in the dishwasher, they are crusted hard and she doesn't pre-rinse them in the sink. They come out the dishwasher with pieces of food still stuck on them. Youngest kid empties the dishwasher. No dishes will be rewashed, my wife refuses to re-wash a dish. To avoid a fight, they are put away. So gross.

I'm scared the judge will think I'm a deadbeat dad that doesn't see his kids often because I don't want to, when the truth is I rather be at home with family instead of accepting extra overtime working weekends because we NEED the money, practically unsustainable at this point. The only reason I have so much saved up now is because I've been working like 20 days in a row, 10hr weekdays, 8 hr/day on weekends, then 21st day is rest day. Next day back to work grinding. Because the last time I was laid off, wife kept asking me when I would go back to work and where. How come I don't have anything saved up? That I am a terrible provider. So she keeps asking these questions and seriously stressing me out when I just need a couple days to decompress and form a plan and I honestly don't know the answers to these questions. I don't know where I am applying to, I don't know who is hiring yet but I put out feelers and waiting for responses. Keep answering the questions but she doesn't like the answers that I don't know, not sure. She kept asking over and over, I answered 15 minutes ago, answer is still the same. Just needling me to the point where I am stressed and snap at her (always verbal never physical). Concerned that she is going to try to claim DV or something and the judge will believe her because of the way I look.

Like yeah shit is bad when I have to charge our credit card because the bank account balance is pretty much zero. Yesterday I had 45 bucks available to me. Had to charge the hotel on credit card. It's like I'm on the edge of a cliff and any gust of wind could knock me down but so far I have been lucky. I'm getting paid in the next few days. About a year ago, I was working and developed a nasty bug from the work environment. Kept me fatigued for months, kept going to the doctor and getting meds, would get better then worsen. Had trouble breathing and moving around. Still kept working. My wife did show concern, especially concerned if it was cancer. ""Are you ok? Is it cancer? Would you tell me if it was cancer? Are you ok? You'd tell me if it was cancer right? You wouldn't hide it"" Reflecting back now, I am not sure she was concerned for my well being or if she had to care for me. I think she would leave/divorce me if I was truly ill. So may as well do it before another 10 years passes and i have to pay more alimony right?

When she said I was a bad provider and that she needs stability, I was shocked and pissed off. Like who is sacrificing their time away from kids and health for the family survival? Who is putting a roof over her head? Who provides the vehicles? My friend thinks bringing up how I'm a bad provider is her way of saying 'why don't we live in a house that we own?' FFS, we would own a house or be damn closer to a down payment if she would stop getting into car accidents that raise our insurance rates, buying stuff, or trimmed back spending on normal stuff like coffee. I don't mention nails, makeup, hair, etc, because her job involves meeting clients so it makes sense to maintain her appearance and she trades her services with other stylists, etc. And no, Idgaf she talks to men clients during her job. It's her job, I expect she is a professional and I have never accused her of cheating on me with a coworker or client. She has accused me of cheating on her with the rare random female coworker I may have on a job site (usually either married/lesbian/seeing someone)

I've only told one person about some of this, some is too embarrassing to admit. Like I seriously never gave it much thought or connected any of it. That's just the way our life is. My friend suggested that I am in an abusive relationship.

Before suspecting her of cheating, I was trying to be okay with the fact that we may not have much sex in our relationship.  If she had a better attitude/behavior, I would consider staying. Even if she may not participate in the finances. We never really talked about finances before marriage. My parents both worked, she had a job, I thought we would have a similar partnership. I knew i made more money than her but I thought she would pitch in when she could. Boy was I wrong. She has stated that she could take more clients/work more but she wants to have time to drop the kids off at school or go to the gym. Maybe I was hopeful she would change with the times. Or mature in age. Or at least pitch in when absolutely needed. But she's past 30 and getting worse not better. Just more selfish as time goes on. Am I being financially/emotionally/verbally abused or is this what traditional roles are supposed to look like?

Couples therapy is not really an option due to finances. I am open to it but I don't think she will be (thinking she outright refuses or call it dumb or she would grudgingly go to the sessions until the therapist doesn't agree with her then she'd stop going).

Thanks for reading, any advice is appreciated. This is just a sliver of the bs I've endured, there's so much more but I get sad thinking back how much time I have wasted and all the crap she's spewed to me. It's hard to think of the good times with her as they seem far and few between. I tried to make a pro/con list and couldn't think of 1 pro... ü§îüòìüòûüòßüò©I finally thought of a pro: She does make my lunch for me when I living at home so I have a lunch to take to work.

The next day Emily was hungover, she woke up with a horrible headache and feeling vaguely sick. David was running around to make sure she had everything she could want. He put the events of yesterday out of his mind as he ran to the store to buy painkillers, as he grabbed her a glass of ice cold Orange Juice and as he made her poached eggs with sourdough toast. He had gone to bed with a feeling of misery descending upon him. But now he had a purpose. His purpose was to please Emily. To make her happy. To make her morning better than it otherwise would have been.

He knocked gently on the bedroom door,

‚ÄúSweetie‚Ä¶sweetie, breakfast is ready. Do you want it downstairs or shall I bring it here so you can have it in bed?‚Äù

‚ÄúBring it up here, and I want coffee!‚Äù Emily demanded of him and David was happy to oblige. He returned with a tray, on which was balanced the poached eggs and toast, the orange juice, the coffee.

‚ÄúI feel so awful‚Äù Emily groaned miserably. ‚ÄúGod, why do I do this to myself?‚Äù David was used to these questions but he knew that the feeling would pass by next weekend.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Baby. I feel so bad for you. Can I rub your feet while you eat? That might help you relax a bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúAwwww, you‚Äôre such a sweetie, yes, that sounds good‚Äù Emily replied, ‚ÄúGo get the lotion‚Ä¶oh and light a few candles.‚Äù

Once David was kneeling on the floor at the foot of the bed, he began to massage her feet. Emily started devouring her breakfast and gave a satisfied sigh.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without you David I really don‚Äôt.‚Äù She smiled down at her husband.

‚ÄúI just love you so much‚Äù David‚Äôs heart was swelling at the smile on his wife‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúI know you do sweetie‚Äù Emily paused for a moment, taking a sip of her coffee, ‚ÄúWhat did I do to deserve you huh?‚Äù She gave his nose a playful tap with her right big toe. David could feel his cock stirring.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre perfect Baby, in every way you‚Äôre perfect‚Ä¶I am the lucky one.‚Äù David spoke, wide eyed, in awe of Emily.

At that moment Emily‚Äôs phone vibrated. She picked it up and all at once it was like David no longer existed. That warmth, that tender atmosphere that was there two minutes ago had disappeared. Emily grinned wide as she typed away on her phone.

David assumed it was HIM‚Ä¶he hated him‚Ä¶he had never met him but he hated him. The name Marco had been floating around his mind for hours last night. He couldn‚Äôt get it out of his mind‚Ä¶Marco‚Ä¶Marco ‚ÄúThat guy was seriously hot‚Äù‚Ä¶Marco‚Ä¶Marco‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI got his number‚Äù‚Ä¶Marco‚Ä¶Marco‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHubby doesn‚Äôt mind‚Äù‚Ä¶Marco‚Ä¶Marco‚Ä¶and then his mind was consumed by the mocking laughter.

‚ÄúWho are you messaging?‚Äù David asked nonchalantly but he regretted it instantly. Emily pulled her feet away from his hands and replied acidly,

‚ÄúNone of your goddamn business.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have some housework to be getting on with?‚Äù She shot at him without taking her eyes away from her phone.

‚ÄúUmmm‚Ä¶I guess so.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell why don‚Äôt you go and do that. It‚Äôs not like I keep you around for your sparkling personality is it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôll go do some cleaning.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, you do that.‚Äù

David closed the door behind him and with a heavy heart he went to the bathroom to start cleaning. He checked his watch, ‚ÄúFive minutes‚Äù he thought to himself, that‚Äôs how long the atmosphere of warmth and joy had lasted, five fucking minutes before the heartache returned.

¬†

Back in the bedroom the messages were flying between Emily and Marco.

‚ÄúLast night was so much fun‚Äù Emily typed

‚ÄúI know right, you were stunning, truly stunning!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt too bad yourself üòâ‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you liked what you saw.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou been thinking about me much?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnce or twice‚Äù

‚ÄúHaha‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to see you again.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about lunch?‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds perfect‚Äù

Talking to Marco about coffee reminded Emily that she had finished her cup. She called out to David,

‚ÄúHey asshole!‚Äù David came running, trying to ignore the name she had used.

‚ÄúYes baby‚Äù He said as he peered round the door.

‚ÄúRefill my coffee.‚Äù She spoke without looking up from her phone, ‚ÄúOh and don‚Äôt call me Baby, I don‚Äôt need the petnames today, just do what I say, understood asshole?‚Äù She looked up at him at that point and her face had a cold, harsh look on it.

‚ÄúErrrr‚Ä¶.yeah of course, sorry.‚Äù David returned with the coffee and decided it was best to stay out of her way today. Why had he asked who she was messaging. Why had he decided to pry into her life. It was none of his goddamn business. He hit himself on the forehead with frustration before returning to his kneeling position in the bathroom and he started scrubbing the toilet.

Once he was finished with the bathroom David hoovered the carpets, he washed the windows, he did some ironing, he cleaned out the fridge, he even washed Emily‚Äôs car. Emily emerged from the bedroom just the once, in order to pee. She didn‚Äôt acknowledge David‚Äôs presence. She knew just how much that would sting. She smiled to herself at the thought of David‚Äôs turmoil.

It was 1pm when David returned to the bedroom. He found Emily under the covers, messaging on her phone, her face was flushed.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve finished the housework Emily‚Äù

Emily looked at him, ‚ÄúOkay, I want to inspect your work, wait downstairs, I‚Äôll be down in a minute.‚Äù

She seemed a lot more perky than this morning which made David happy. He genuinely hated the idea of her being hungover, in pain or discomfort. He stood at the bottom of the stairs and smiled sweetly as she descended to his level. She did not return his smile.

‚ÄúI want to make sure you are meeting my standards David. Can‚Äôt keep a lazy houseboy around can I?‚Äù She smirked at him.

‚ÄúI have tried really hard Emily, I promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell I‚Äôll be the judge of that.‚Äù Emily replied as she strolled into the kitchen. David followed her, his head bowed and his heart pounding. Emily was silent, giving no indication of her thoughts as she inspected the kitchen. No ‚ÄúWell done‚Äù, No ‚ÄúI‚Äôm impressed‚Äù, not even a smile. She just inspected and then moved on‚Ä¶Maybe that is a good sign, David thought.

She moved onto the lounge and that‚Äôs where her criticisms started,

‚ÄúThese cushions aren‚Äôt puffed up enough!‚Äù David quickly apologised as he puffed up the cushions.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù She asked as she ran her finger across the television screen.

‚ÄúUmmmmm‚Ä¶dust.‚Äù David answered, unable to meet her eye.

‚ÄúShould it be there?‚Äù Emily asked pointedly.

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm sorry‚Äù David grabbed a cloth and wiped the screen.

‚ÄúYou will be sorry if it happens again.‚Äù Emily said coldly.

David felt like his testicles were retreating inside him at the implied threat‚Ä¶what would she do to him if it happened again, he wondered. He was amazed by Emily‚Äôs change. She had always been demanding, she had always had high standards and expected him to do 90% of the household chores. But she had never been quite so mean about it in the past.

David hurried after her into the bathroom. She stood just inside the room with her hands on her hips. She looked like she was trying to find something wrong but David could see nothing amiss. There were no stray hairs in the bath, no water stains on the shower glass. The toilet was sparkling. Emily turned on her heel and just said one word, ‚ÄúGood!‚Äù She didn‚Äôt even smile as she said it. It was more a statement of fact, an indication that this was the standard that she expected, rather than a word of encouragement.

Emily was equally pleased with the bedroom. She enjoyed how hard her husband had clearly worked to please her. She lay down on the bed and smiled at him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pleased David, you‚Äôve done well today. Apart from you asking questions that are none of your business and your mistakes in the lounge, I‚Äôve been pleased with you. I think you deserve a treat.‚Äù

David‚Äôs mouth went dry as he watched his wife shuffle her skirt down and pull her panties down her legs, exposing her beautiful pussy. She took her left index finger and gently ran it along her labia. David could feel his breath becoming shallow. His heart thudded in his chest. His cock stirred.

‚ÄúWould you like a treat?‚Äù Emily asked.

‚ÄúOh fuck yes I really would.‚Äù David almost pleaded.

‚ÄúYou sound kind of desperate sweetie.‚Äù Emily teased.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just so hot!‚Äù

‚ÄúI am aren‚Äôt I‚Äù Emily paused for a moment before her voice took a sharper, more authoritative turn. ‚ÄúWell come over here and get that tongue to work.‚Äù

David practically dived onto the bed as he buried his face between her thighs. He could feel her hand on the back of his head.

‚ÄúEasy, slow down tiger‚Äù Emily giggled as she tapped on his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like a man who hasn‚Äôt eaten in weeks. Take your time, I want to enjoy this!‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry sweetie‚Äù David‚Äôs voice was muffled.‚Äù

Emily picked up her phone and went to her messages. She felt naught, devious, cruel but she couldn‚Äôt stop herself. She opened up the conversation she was having with Marco.

‚ÄúLooking forward to tomorrow, what are you up to today?‚Äù She asked him

David was giving her licks along the length of her pussy. He knew she liked that before he started to get to work on her clit. He was aware that she was on her phone above him. He tried to ignore it, tried to make sure it didn‚Äôt interfere with his performance. He was desperate to please her, desperate to make her cum.

‚ÄúJust finished at the gym, how about you?‚Äù Came Marco‚Äôs response.

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt believe me, if I told you.‚Äù

‚ÄúTry me üòâ‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know how I told you about my husband being a pushover‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah üòÇ‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs literally going down on me while I talk to you üòà‚Äù

‚ÄúNooooooo, fuck, that is incredible. You seriously wear the pants in that relationship.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn straight‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so fucking hot! I can‚Äôt wait till tomorrow‚Äù

‚ÄúMe neither‚Äù

Emily grinned, thrilled with how things were going. This is exactly how she wanted things to go; her husband completely wrapped around her finger and a date lined up with a sexy, confident man.

‚ÄúFaster!‚Äù She ordered and within less than a second her husband‚Äôs tongue sped up.",5,1745525849.0,cuck_femdom_tales,2,0.86,False
