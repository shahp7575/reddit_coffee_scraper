I know Reddit isn’t exactly known for great or long-term connections, but hey, figured I’d put this out there for anyone looking for something a bit more real than the swipe fatigue.



I’m 28, based in the UK, and no, I don’t actually go around saying, 'right, what’s all this then?' If that joke or meme is a mystery to you, feel free to ignore my nonsense lol. I’m not expecting instant replies, life happens, but it’d be nice to find something that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



I’m a massive fiction nerd. After work, all I want is to disappear into another world with a good book. I keep telling myself I’ll get back into reading history, but so far it’s mostly just Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I’m seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it’s in a slightly unconventional way. Definitely better than abandoning it altogether, even if uni tried its best to crush my soul with an enormous reading list. Spoiler: I never followed it. This is me, master of excuses and self-justifications. 😀 If you’re into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I’d definitely recommend them.



Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you’re feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you’ve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I’ve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I’m deep in the running cult. Minus the influencer energy. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after, all part of the running cult I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of said cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. What cult are you part of? 🤣



Now that I’ve rambled like I’m overly caffeinated, (cough cough,) I am, it’s only fair you tell me about yourself. What’s your thing? What’s the hobby or obsession you’d like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I’m into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. For me, amazing conversations are when we forget about time, doesn't matter whether it's serious or lighthearted, the next thing we know, it's been hours. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, and hopefully sparks fly. I’m open to wherever it goes, as long as it’s real.



Got a book that’ll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn’t involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I’m listening.



If you made it all the way down here, clearly we both have commitment and stamina. Promising start already.

Understanding the nuances of each model will ensure you make an informed decision and enjoy perfectly heated water for years to come.

## Key Features analysis

Zwilling electric kettles boast a range of features designed to provide convenience, safety, and performance.**Precise Temperature Control**

Many Zwilling electric kettles offer precise temperature control,enabling users to select the ideal temperature for different types of tea or coffee. This feature ensures optimal flavor extraction and prevents burning, which can ruin the taste of delicate teas. The adjustable temperature settings typically range from 100°F to 212°F (boiling point), offering versatility for various beverages.

**Keep-Warm Function**

The keep-warm function is a valuable addition that maintains the desired water temperature for a specified period, usually around 30 minutes. This eliminates the need to re-boil water multiple times, saving energy and time. It's especially useful when serving guests or enjoying multiple cups of tea or coffee over a longer period.

**Double-Wall Construction**

Select Zwilling kettles feature double-wall construction, which helps to insulate the water and keep it hot for longer while also keeping the exterior cool to the touch. This safety feature prevents accidental burns, making the kettle safer to handle, especially around children. The double-wall design also contributes to energy efficiency by reducing heat loss.

**Seamless Stainless Steel Interior**

A seamless stainless steel interior is another hallmark of Zwilling kettles. This design eliminates crevices where bacteria can accumulate,ensuring hygienic and easy cleaning. Stainless steel is also durable and resistant to corrosion, contributing to the longevity of the kettle.The absence of plastic components in contact with the water ensures purity and prevents any unwanted flavors from leaching into the water.

**Automatic Shut-Off and Boil-Dry Protection**

Safety is a priority in Zwilling kettle design. Automatic shut-off ensures that the kettle turns off automatically once the water has reached the selected temperature or boiling point. Boil-dry protection prevents the kettle from operating without sufficient water, protecting the heating element from damage and preventing potential fire hazards.

## Core Benefits

The automatic shut-off feature prevents the kettle from overheating, while the boil-dry protection prevents damage to the heating element. The cool-touch exterior of double-wall models minimizes the risk of accidental burns. These safety features contribute to a safer and more worry-free kitchen environment.**Energy Efficiency:** Zwilling electric kettles are designed to boil only the required amount of water,reducing energy consumption compared to heating water on a stovetop.

1kz86xd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kz86xd/1st_relationship_need_an_advice/,1st relationship. Need an advice.,"I [26M] am dating my GF[23F] since 8months. It is my first relationship. I'm very introvert & shy kind of person specially In case of girls. So, I never had a GF before. I don't usually talk to people unless they talk to me first. & My GF is opposite of me in many aspects as she is an extrovert, easy going, smart & beautiful. 

We met 9 months ago. We we're working at the same place. She was my junior. It all started when she replied to my whatsapp status. Then gradually we started chatting which continued for like 2 weeks. Initially I wasn't very open in talking to her but she made me feel very comfortable. But I was still scared to talk to her face to face. We used to chat a lot till 3am or 4am. We started appreciating each other, talking about family, friends, childhood, schools etc. I told her that I was never in a relationship before wih anyone. & She told the same. 

After 3-4 weeks, One day I asked her out for a coffee. She agreed. It was the first time that I was meeting her face to face with no one around. It went well. & Since then we started having out daily & we used roam & enjoy time with each other. 

After 3 months, I confessed her that I love her. I told her that I feel very lucky to have her in my life. I have never been so happy. She started crying.  She said that she never thought we would reach upto this stage. She started talking to me because found me cutee, calm & very interesting person. & Then She said YES. I was overwhelmed with her reposne but kept calm. Then we're spending more time with each other. We used to hug & kiss. & We started having physical relation after 6 months. Although she is younger than me, i always felt like I'm the younger one. I used to make lot of mistakes, sometimes I felt like I'm not good enough for her. 

One day, She tells me that it is not her 1st relationship. She had been in a relationship for 6 years with a guy from her highschool. She was madly in love with her. Once her family found about them, they tried to keep them seperate. So much so that she fought with her own family for him. She even tried to harm herself. Once they passed high school they were in long distance relationship for 2 years. They were not much in contact. Then, 2 year ago when she found out he cheated on her with someone else. She confronted him & they broke up. She said that she is not in contact with him but sometimes misses him & used to cry. She is trying to forget him but it's been very difficult for her as she was deeply attached to him. 

Acc to her, she was trying to tell me about her previous relationship since I confessed my love but never had a courage. She was too scared to tell me in the beginning of our relationship as it could have ruined our first. Since now we are very comfortable with each other & so she has gathered courage to tell me. She even said if I'm not okay with this then we will do whatever feels right to me. 

I consoled her & said that leave the past behind. She did the right thing by telling me herself without asking. Although it would have been better if she told me earlier but it doesn't matter much now since it's a thing of past. I love her & I expect just a good communication, trust & loyalty between us. I'm looking forward & I just want her to stay clear about things. 

We sat there for sometime & went to a garden & watched a movie. Then went home. But I'm still thinking about this. I have a habbit of overthink Any suggestions what should I do ?? Or am I just overthinking ??

1kz86ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/VISI_CAD/comments/1kz86ck/update_debugging_not_an_expert/,Update debugging - Not an expert,"Hey guys. My specific question is marked below, but a bit of background info.Taking a bit of a shot in the dark here given the infrequent activity here - and general lack of information about VISI online - but here we go. 

Shop has used VISI for years. 15 seats total. Shop pays for maintenance on all of them but we've never used customer support very much. 

Used nearly exclusively for 3/5 axis milling. No major module options. Solid/surface modeling, advanced customization & the milling stuff. VISI is great for simple, direct manipulation of part models to give us better machining surfaces. No complicated assembly stuff, maybe half a dozen layers and 2/3 different models at a time at most. 

We have a few different versions in the shop. Nothing later than 2022. We're looking to update to 2024.4. I've taken upon myself to oversee this project - our longtime IT guru is no longer with the company. 

Couple details:

• I'm not a coder. 
• I'm not an idiot. I can read, do math and process information. I'd be capable of following directions and maybe doing a bit of coding but may need walked through the first example. The API library seems potentially valuable but I have no idea how to use it. 
• I've scoured the web and Hexagon portal for every PDF & video I could find - I followed the directions and was able to download 2024.4 seamlessly while leaving older versions of the software intact and operable. The migration tool worked great. Right now I'm fine-tuning UI/graphics settings. Plan is to debug, copy and distribute shop wide. 

Question 1: Why does Change attribute > select solid body or individual face > pick color not change the color of the solid?

This never happened in older versions with single models unless it was a weird import. In that case the 'reset color' dialogue box worked every time. The 'reset color' box is now 'reset face color' & 'reset face transparency'. Even if I select those the solid remainins the same. 

What am I missing? I'm thinking it's a graphics thing, seems like the solid takes the new color on but visually it doesn't change. Hope this is a dumb question answered easily - there's no scenario wherein we can use the updated software without 1/2 click color manipulation.

Question 2: How likely is it the Hexagon support people help me out? We pay a shit ton of money on yearly maintenance but have rarely used it for support, though I have asked for guidance twice recently and they were super helpful both times. 0% chance we spend $ on additional training. I'm not sure how these maintenance fees work - is it just a glorified subscription or are they likely to provide actual support without demanding more money? I intend to use the resource only when necessary. I don't deal with finances directly but I'd be willing to hint to the support guys we won't be renewing maintenance. It's not a bluff, if we can't use the updated software we aren't going to pay five figures.

If there's anyone that reads this, knows what I'm talking about and is feeling generous a DM would be cool. Would happily buy you a cup of coffee..or a few.

My dad lives in rural Tennessee, where power outages are kind of expected during big storms. Last year, after two outages in one month, he decided he’d had enough. But instead of buying one of those big, expensive generators (which are honestly a hassle for someone in their 70s), he found this guide online called The Lost Generator.

[The Lost Generator](https://preview.redd.it/ba25j29b0y3f1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8cd1a051b0bde69ee0b454ef832590141855ef5)

It’s not a physical generator you buy—it’s actually a guide that shows you how to build your own compact backup power system with stuff that’s surprisingly easy to find. He came across it while browsing online one night—some kind of post or forum.

Anyway, he spent a couple weekends putting it together. Said it cost way less than even the cheapest gas-powered generator, and it doesn’t require fuel. I wasn’t totally sold… until last month’s storm hit.

Power went out around 7 PM. But this time, instead of lighting candles and tossing food from the fridge the next day, my dad plugged his essentials into the setup he’d built—his fridge, phone charger, and even a small heater. Everything worked. No noise, no gas fumes, no stress.

He even had enough juice to brew coffee the next morning. Honestly, I was impressed.

I’m not super handy, but if he could build this thing, I probably could too. Feels like a smart solution for folks in rural areas or anyone prepping for unexpected outages. It’s not a giant power source, but it’s enough to get by comfortably in an emergency—and that’s more than most people have.

1kz80s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1kz80s5/i_am_trapped_in_a_soap_oprea/,I Am Trapped In A Soap Oprea,"I don't even know if this will reach anyone, but if I have to listen to Amy whine and moan about her poor life choices anymore, I'm going to kill myself. 

My sister was obsessed with soaps growing up, I have no idea why. She was a magnet for drama, always striving to outdo her latest controversy. Maybe she got a thrill out of watching people have worse lives than her, fictional or otherwise. Every day at school I'd smile and nod as she raved on and on about Jason picking Sarah over Tracy, or how could Emilio cheat on Patty, and *gasp*, I would never guess who had a secret twin.

Meanwhile she did her earnest to act out her delusions by playing matchmaker or spreading rumors and slander among our peers. When she was called out or caught in the act, she would break down into hysterics and claim no one understood her. As you can imagine, she was truly insufferable, but she was my sister, so I did my best to stick up for her and shield her from the worst of the mockery.

We grew apart when we left for college, I stayed east while she made the pilgrimage to the sunny West coast; the mecca of soaps she called it. I don't know anyone else who did. I tried to stay in touch with her but it was exhausting, every call would deteriorate into a ""woo is me"" campaign about how people were snarky and mean to her. Meanwhile I was struggling to meet ends met and my English degree was collecting dust on a shelf while I scrambled to find something that wasn't flipping burgers.

But did I complain? No, I was the big sister. I had to take it all in stride and support Nico no matter what. It sickens me to say this, but when I got the call that she had been in a wreck- God help me I-I was almost relieved. I was revolted at myself for thinking this, but the constant drama and victimizing was drowning me.

There was a small service, just family and friends of which I noticed there were few of both in attendance. She had been cremated, an urn on display like a golden chalice you could gawk at. A man I later found out to be Nico's lawyer pulled me aside and explained my sister had left me something in her will. The nihilist freak inside me expected some sort of horrendous debt or loan she had taken out in my name, one last plot twist to throw in my life like a live grenade.

Instead, I find she had left me her vast collection of soap tapes. I'm talking dozens of boxes showing up at my door filled with hundreds of DVDs; *Grey's Anatomy, All My Children*, you name it she had at least three complete series boxsets. As I gazed upon the pile of slop on my front porch, I could feel an ulcer clawing its way through my insides, that queasy feeling I would always get when she babbled on and on about the shows she was watching, or when she sat me down and I had to choke an hour of primetime down when I hung out with her.

I gave it all to goodwill that night, without a second thought. Maybe I had a twinge of guilt for denying my sister's dying wish, but I didn't even have the space for it. There was a note as well, at the time I assumed it was some stipulation or ways to care for the collection, but I didn't care I just wanted it out of my sight. I went to bed that night with a lump in my stomach and the gnawing feeling I had let Nico down.

The next morning is when my hell began.

The first thing I noticed was how. . . Bright everything was. My eyes squinted to adjust, every color in my room was Sepe atone yet saturated to hell at the same time. I struggled to get up and nausea overtook me immediately. Every movement I made felt like I was moving in hyper real time, you ever see those TVs at Best Buy that have the super crisp screens playing on them? That's how moving felt like.

I collapsed to the ground and dry heaved, like a baby deer learning to walk on wobbly legs for the first time. My head spun worse than any hangover I had ever had. In the distance I could hear what I could only describe as the most generic jingle I had ever heard, like Nickelback and any royalty free tune had a child; this was that jingle.

I forced myself up and studied my surroundings. The walls were covered with boyband posters and teen heartthrobs, disgustingly stereotypical to be honest. I squinted as I looked around the room, my eyes adjusting to the bright yet dull lighting. In the corner was a dresser, covered in pictures of me laughing it up with people I had never met before, yet had a vague recollection of seeing.

A sharp knock echoed through the facade, and my heart jumpstarted as a shrill voice called my name. The door opened and a crimson haired woman who bore a striking resemblance to Molly Ringwald stood there, striking a pose in a violet sundress. 

""Carmen I'm not gonna call you again, get your butt down here and join us for breakfast. Amy already apologized for last night, you're older than her you need to be the bigger person."" She commanded in this, condescending annoyed tone. With that she turned and walked away. I was bewildered, to say the least.

The logical part of my brain was reassuring me that this was some sort of bizarre lucid dream. Yet my throbbing headache and aching eyes were warning me otherwise. I stumbled downstairs, clenching the cherrywood banister like it owed me money. It felt hollow to the touch, like I could rip it off and reveal Styrofoam mesh under it without breaking a sweat. From the kitchen I could hear the cry of a beached whale coughing up blood, piercing my ear drums like a sharpened harpoon.

I turned the corner to find that horrid cry was actually a neglected baby, absent mindly being cradled by a bored looking teenager, face caked in shoddy lighting and makeup. A family was huddled around the table, ignoring the borderline child abuse happening in front of them. They were picking at their food; a delicious smelling buffet of eggs and fruit, yet I noticed that they weren't really eating, it was almost like bad play acting.

At the table was another teenage girl, some skinny kid eyeing the neglected baby, a ginormous whale of a man sitting next to that kid, and a middle-aged bald man next to him. The whale-man struck me as familiar, I had seen him before and I knew where. I smiled, relaxing as I realized that this HAD to be a dream now. I plopped down at the table next to the wailing babe, the teenager giving me the nastiest side eye. I had ever seen.

Everyone at the table seemed so perky and caked up, the whole scene picturesque. There was an odd tension though, like everyone despised being in the same room together. The crimson haired woman was washing dishes, oblivious to the scene around her. The big guy chirped up, clearing his throat to reveal a husky voice and a gruff Italian accent. 

""It's nice to see we can all still eat together, considering."" he remarked, a dopey grin on his face. The bald guy next to him smiled, simply sipping his coffee. ""Amy did Ben tell you about his summer trip?"" He nudged the skinny kid next to him, who looked down at his food sheepishly. The girl holding the baby rolled her eyes. 

""No, he's too busy with that tramp, and I'm fine with that. He made his choice."" There was such venom in her words

""How can you call her a tramp after what you did with Ricky."" Ben roared. I was in awe at the ridiculous history these highschoolers seemed to share. 

""He was there for me, when you weren't. If you really loved me, you would have stayed with me over the summer instead of running off to Italy."" She cried, tears of the crocodilian variety streaking down her face. I held in a laugh at this, this was absurd. Amy noticed and turned her attention to me. ""Carmen don't laugh, this is my life, is it all a big joke to you."" She whined, the babe stirring in her arms half-hazardly. 

""Honestly yeah, this was one of the worst shows Nico ever forced me to watch with her, how you even had a career after it was nothing short of black magic."" I scoffed. I grabbed at fork and dug in, the eggs tasting like burnt plastic. I gagged and spat it out, while Amy's mouth was agape. 

""How could you say that to me, you know how hard of a choice it was to leave baby John behind while I went to that music camp over the summer. My life is hard enough without having to get chastised for it."" She cried, shoving the baby to the girl next to her as she ran crying upstairs. Everyone eyed me, scorn flashing across their face.

""Somebody got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning."" The bald guy mumbled. 

""Maybe she's had too much SUGAR with her coffee."" The other teen girl snidely commented. Whatever the implication there was clearly went over my head, because the woman, who I assumed to be the mom, shot her a hushed look as everyone shifted uncomfortably. I just went back to trying to force this food down my gullet. I was oddly hungry for a dream, I remember thinking. Amy stormed back downstairs, eying me trying to eat. She scoffed in my general direction.

""I guess you aren't too worried about tryouts then Carmen."" She said in this bitchy voice that made me want to throttle her.

""What the hell are you blabbering about?"" I asked her, choking down breakfast as best I could.

""Thought you were watching your figure."" She pointed at the scrambled eggs. She had a smug look on her face, and I swear I could hear some sort of dramatic sting, like she had said something truly heinous. 

""Dude why are you trying to insult me, it's pathetic."" I laughed at her. She just scowled and sat back down. Now the mom was coming over, a grave look on her face. 

""Honey, you need to calm down, you're acting crazy, do you want me to call your mother."" She leaned over me, her tone deadly serious. 

""Pfft, please do it, she's been dead for four years I'd love to hear from her."" I spoke. Everyone shared a look now, like I was the insane one. 

""Never mind we'll talk about this after school."" She pushed herself away, a crack in her voice. Silence draped the dinner table like an old friend, and I just shrugged it off and tried to eat more. I blinked and suddenly I was standing in front of a school, it was jarring to say the least. Amy was walking past me, shoulder checking me.

I tried to leave the school instantly because, well I'm 34 but every turn I took down the road led right back to the front entrance. Which was still full of kids idling away by the way, all huddled together like extras told to stand there and look busy. I was running in place of the building for what seemed like hours, nothing changed, the sun didn't move, the extras didn't move. The only place I could go was inside.

The inside was a generic high school. You've seen one you've seen them all. I wandered the building, it seemed like I could go anywhere, but I was getting strange looks from teachers. They kept asking me where my hall pass was, or shouldn't I be in class right now. I ignored them and eventually they just gave up. I kept hearing bits and pieces of the goings on in the day; Ricky and Ben had gotten into a fight, Grace had broken up with her boyfriend, Ben had married Adriane, which aren't these kids like 16? How is that even legal.

No one seemed to be talking about anything sustainable, it was all borderline snark and gossip. It was infuriating, and I found out there was gossip about me as well. Apparently, I was ""Back on the coke."" according to my cousin Amy. Back on the- the most I've ever done was smoke a joint once in junior high. I remember gagging on the rancid smell, hadn't touched the stuff since.

God everywhere I turned was Amy, Amy, Amy-, she had gotten knocked up again, she had cheated, she had been cheated on, she was married, she was divorced, she was a great mom, she was a deadbeat, my god the whole school seemed to revolve around her, she was like a blackhole of cringe.

Everywhere I turned she was there, either crying or fighting, or making some childish comment about my looks, like she was queen mean girl. She'd pause after every insult, like she expected me to stoop to her childish level, then scowl and storm off when I didn't engage.

Eventually I wound up back ""Home"" staring at a blank TV screen as Amy and Ricky argued next to me. It was about something so asinine, he had been late to dinner because the baby had an earache, so he rushed him to the doctors. Evidently Ricky should have thought of how that would make Amy feel, because she worked so hard on dinner and now it was cold, and she looks like a bad mom because she wasn't at the doctors and LIFE IS SOOOOO HARD RIGHT NOW- I wanted to take one of those couch cushions and smother her with it.

I was spacing out hard when she whapped me on the shoulder, vying for my attention. 

""Don't you agree he should be more attentive to my needs?"" She whined. 

""I don't care."" I mumbled.

""Leave her alone Amy"" Ricky retorted. Amy rolled her eyes in response.

""You would take his side, you've always been jealous of us, of my life."" The smug bitch said.

""Fucking disgusting, he's like 17-your life is an abhorrent nightmare I wish I could wake up from."" I yelled to the ceiling. She was about to open her mouth again, but I jumped up from the couch and sprinted to the front door, determined to wake myself up out of the dream. I saw the front door and I swung it open to be faced with-

nothing.

There was a total black void where there should have been a freshly cut front lawn-Hell if I glanced out the front room bay windows, I could still see the setting embers shining through. I turned back and it felt like I had just experienced whiplash, in a blink I was lying in bed again, a fresh morning, that God awful jingle signaling a new day- a new episode.

It's hard to keep track of time here, I keep drifting from scene to scene, it'll be early morning then pitch black out with a facade of crickets out front in an instant. If I had to guess I have been trapped in this place for-maybe three months.

Everyday it's the same, I wander around as these caricature's bitch and moan about their life and argue over every little thing, and do their damndest to drag me in with them. Maybe that's the way out, play the part till it lets me go. Or maybe that's how I really get stuck here.

I've tried a lot of ways to get out. I tried walking into the void, it was colder than anything I had ever experienced, and when I came to the mom was standing over me, asking what I took.

I've tried calling them out by their actor's names, the ones I recognized anyway. The husky guy, one time I ran up to him and just yelled ""STEVE, STEVE this is a television show, you're an actor, none of this is real."" He just kind of laughed it off and asked me if this was my way of feeling out if Ben was single.

It's insanity, even the adults act like spoiled pouty rich brats. I've been here so long the place is starting to recycle plot lines, I swear to Christ Amy's kid is actually getting YOUNGER the longer I stay here. I searched my room the other day, looking for hidden cameras or something to prove that maybe this was all an elaborate gameshow or something. I ended up finding the note my sister left me, I read it, and this is what it said:

*""To my dearest Carmen, you always got me when one else would give me the time of day. I cherish our memories together, when we would watch our favorite shows, how you would always stand up for me-you were always there for me in life, and I want to do the same for you. In the event of my death, I will be cremated, and I leave to you sole possession of both my prized collection of drama and my remains. Instructions have been left with the lawyer and the crematorium, and I know it is a lot to ask, but I know you'll do the right thing and watch over me, as you always did. Part of me always did love these shows, and now a part of me will stay with them as well. Forever your grateful sister- Nico""*

Well, my heart sunk when I read that. I don't know what to do now, I've tried begging Nico for mercy, if she can hear me, if it is her back to curse me for abandoning her. But I was met with silence and mockery from the always lurking Amy.

I'm running out of options and patience, I need to get out of this hell, Nico I'm sorry I gave away the tapes, I didn't know. God help me I'll track every one of those tapes if I get out of here.

I hear Amy giggling to herself out in the hall, she's gonna dump the baby on her sister and go out clubbing with a fake ID because "" She's a grownup, why can't she have fun?""

I changed my mind; if this reaches no one and nothing changes, I think I'll try killing Amy first.

I am a male in my mid twenties who decided to start taking Reta. Been on it for 6-7 weeks. Been really noticing less and less motivation for things as each day goes on. And this week alone has been very hard. It also kills my sex drive which I guess is fine because I’m currently not in a relationship or anything but I miss that feeling. I have no desire to meet or even really talk to a woman other than thru text because that’s easy but that’s about it. 

I already had depression prior to this but was doing alright. I am able to sleep but do wake up during the night here and there some days. Waking up most days / everyday having to drag myself out of bed for work. But it’s strange because then I’ll get a coffee and most times only drink half of it and be fine and chuck the rest. It’s odd. 

May be the lower intake of food and in all honesty, haven’t been eating good either. I have no motivation to cook anything and just resort to something easy and fast but it’s crap. Not a good cycle. Gonna drop it and see how it goes

Not sure how many times I’ll rewrite this, but here it goes. I’m hoping to meet people around my age or older…those who appreciate conversations that aren’t rushed or forced, but grow naturally over time, like slow-burning stories.

*English isn’t my first language*, so I might stumble or ask you to repeat things now and then. Still, I find that talking with native speakers is the best way to learn, like catching tiny moments textbooks never mention, or those unspoken meanings hiding between the lines.

I’m drawn to books that make me think, long walks into quiet places where the world slows down, and yoga to find balance when life gets too loud. I don’t open up quickly, but I do notice the small details  the ones most people miss, like the way a pause can say more than words ever will.

***Patience draws me in like a quiet river,
and kindness is the current that holds me close.***

If you enjoy honest conversations without pressure or pretense, and don’t mind the occasional awkward silence or comfortable pause, we might just get along better than you expect.

Bonus points if you can handle a little dark humor, a pinch of sarcasm, and a sharp wit, though I don’t recommend facing all three before morning coffee.

If this sounds like your kind of thing, send a message or drop a comment. *Fair warning: I’m often better at sarcasm than small talk*, but that might just be the start of something interesting.

I did my undergrad in the US and then moved back home because I wanted to be closer to family and I miss rainy London. About me: I love to run, swim, hike. My hobbies include, crafting, cooking, reading, movies, and music. My preferred drink is a Matcha Latte but I also really love coffee. My studies and work keep me incredibly busy but ever so often I crave some good deep conversations with a hint (a lot) of sweetness.  I enjoy having academic conversations since I love learning new things. I’m a big fan of staying in and if I could I would probably never leave my house. I’m incredibly open to sharing pictures and eventually talking over voice call and I love questions so feel free to ask me anything:))

Sorry for the long read in advance.

I had a panic attack yesterday and I didn’t have anyone to talk to about it. I’ve been feeling incredibly isolated lately and it hasn’t helped I’ve had to deal with a lot without support. Most of the time, I’m on my own with my thoughts. I used to have a support system but over the past couple of years things have slowly fallen apart. I’ve lost all my friends, don’t have any family support, have had to give up on uni because of my depression, so it feels like everything’s crumbling apart and what little I had left to look forward to is gone. I’ve had to give up on the one career goal/dream I had, which required my degree. I put so much into making sure I’d be good enough for this role once I got my degree including doing loads of work experience and now it’s all over and I won’t be able to pursue this career anymore.

Right now I’m going through a lot and dealing with it all on my own. There’s the stress of being kicked out by my family soon because of not finishing uni and them going on about how I wasted all the opportunities they gave me, money worries and just this constant feeling that I’m losing everything bit by bit. I did have a counsellor but I can’t carry on cause of the cost and I need to save up as much as I can for when I get kicked out. Still spoke to him this week but I can’t keep booking sessions even though it was the only time during the week I had to look forward to where I could speak to someone for a bit. I won’t have anywhere to go in the next couple of months when my family find out about the uni situation and I’ll need to find somewhere to live but everything is expensive and I don’t have anywhere to crash whilst I get back on my feet. I try to keep myself distracted and hold it together, especially at work, but when I’m off or alone it really hits me how empty things feel. I’d love to travel and catch a break for a bit but I can’t afford to. I currently have a part time job and although it can be hard to go in on the days I’m really struggling, I enjoy the chats I have with my colleagues and it’s the only time I really get to speak to anyone in person. The job is only contracted till July so I’ve only got about 5 weeks (15days ish) left and I won’t have anyone to speak to irl once I finish until I find a new job and idk how long that will take.

I’m applying for jobs I’m not even interested in and don’t really have any other choice just so I have an income for now but keep getting rejected, I’ve tried retail, supermarkets, admin and any other type of job that I can do. The issue is that most decent jobs require degrees and the ones that don’t, I know will have a tonne of applications so the chances of progressing with the applications are even slimmer.

I don’t want to be a burden on anyone but days like today feel unbearable without anyone to reach out to. I just wish things felt a bit less heavy and that I didn’t feel so invisible. I wish I actually mattered to people. At first I thought maybe it was the depression lying to me but the past year especially I’ve come to realise how alone I really am. I didn’t have anyone to spend my birthday with or new years or any other event. I’ve come to realise that people often don’t reciprocate the efforts and energy put into friendships and will give different amounts, but it feels like I’ve always been the one to give more and now that I can’t it’s like I’m no use to anyone. It’s not even like I was constantly telling people about how much I was struggling, I knew if I did it would push them away so I’d keep it bottled up but they ended up leaving anyway. I’ve always been the person people come to with their problems or whenever they need to vent but I don’t have anyone I can do the same with. I have one person I feel like I’m able to be open with about this stuff but don’t want to drain her of her energy when she already has her own life, and things have changed recently and she can’t always be there to talk to even about regular stuff. Things won’t go back to how they were for a while because of external factors but she’s the only person who gave good advice and felt like she fully understood me. It’s times like this I just wish I had someone to chat to, not even about the heavy stuff, but for a distraction so I could stop thinking about how bad things have gotten. Someone I could share reels/memes or go for walks or a coffee with but it’s so hard making new friends and I don’t think I’m interesting enough for people anymore. I’ve tried going to social events off insta but I don’t really click with anyone.

Ive been trying so hard to get through without the help I can’t seem to find and get out of the rut myself but something always pulls me back to this place. I’m 24 and I’ve done nothing with my life. Maybe people are right and it’s my fault for not being able to just get on with things and make the most of the opportunities I wasted. Someone else could’ve done so much more with the opportunities I’ve been given in my life yet I just fucked it up like I fuck everything up.

Thanks if you’ve read this. I’m not expecting a solution to my problems, I just needed to say it out loud somewhere",2,1748620541.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I'm looking to start the workbook from Julia Cameron - The Artist's Way. The book provides a structure for picking up or restarting creative practices of any kind - something I've been craving the last few years. 

I've tried the program before and had a hard time getting past a few weeks in. I think an accountability buddy (or buddies) would be helpful, and be an opportunity to build in some socializing too. Anyone interested in meeting once a week for an hour to get a coffee and check in? I'm a 38 year old dad of a toddler and a prof at UW. Looking to get back into visual art and a more dedicated musical practice. 

I'd like to start on Monday! Free/pdf copies of the book are easily available. DM or comment and I'll put together a list of contacts. ",2,1748620529.0,madisonwi,0,1.0,False

My sister was obsessed with soaps growing up, I have no idea why. She was a magnet for drama, always striving to outdo her latest controversy. Maybe she got a thrill out of watching people have worse lives than her, fictional or otherwise. Every day at school I'd smile and nod as she raved on and on about Jason picking Sarah over Tracy, or how could Emilio cheat on Patty, and *gasp*, I would never guess who had a secret twin. 

Meanwhile she did her earnest to act out her delusions by playing matchmaker or spreading rumors and slander among our peers. When she was called out or caught in the act, she would break down into hysterics and claim no one understood her. As you can imagine, she was truly insufferable, but she was my sister, so I did my best to stick up for her and shield her from the worst of the mockery. 

We grew apart when we left for college, I stayed east while she made the pilgrimage to the sunny West coast; the mecca of soaps she called it. I don't know anyone else who did. I tried to stay in touch with her but it was exhausting, every call would deteriorate into a ""woo is me"" campaign about how people were snarky and mean to her. Meanwhile I was struggling to meet ends met and my English degree was collecting dust on a shelf while I scrambled to find something that wasn't flipping burgers. 

But did I complain? No, I was the big sister. I had to take it all in stride and support Nico no matter what. It sickens me to say this, but when I got the call that she had been in a wreck- God help me I-I was almost relieved. I was revolted at myself for thinking this, but the constant drama and victimizing was drowning me. 

There was a small service, just family and friends of which I noticed there were few of both in attendance. She had been cremated, an urn on display like a golden chalice you could gawk at. A man I later found out to be Nico's lawyer pulled me aside and explained my sister had left me something in her will. The nihilist freak inside me expected some sort of horrendous debt or loan she had taken out in my name, one last plot twist to throw in my life like a live grenade.

 Instead, I find she had left me her vast collection of soap tapes. I'm talking dozens of boxes showing up at my door filled with hundreds of DVDs; *Grey's Anatomy, All My Children*, you name it she had at least three complete series boxsets. As I gazed upon the pile of slop on my front porch, I could feel an ulcer clawing its way through my insides, that queasy feeling I would always get when she babbled on and on about the shows she was watching, or when she sat me down and I had to choke an hour of primetime down when I hung out with her.

 I gave it all to goodwill that night, without a second thought. Maybe I had a twinge of guilt for denying my sister's dying wish, but I didn't even have the space for it. There was a note as well, at the time I assumed it was some stipulation or ways to care for the collection, but I didn't care I just wanted it out of my sight. I went to bed that night with a lump in my stomach and the gnawing feeling I had let Nico down.

 The next morning is when my hell began. 

The first thing I noticed was how. . . Bright everything was. My eyes squinted to adjust, every color in my room was Sepe atone yet saturated to hell at the same time. I struggled to get up and nausea overtook me immediately. Every movement I made felt like I was moving in hyper real time, you ever see those TVs at Best Buy that have the super crisp screens playing on them? That's how moving felt like.

 I collapsed to the ground and dry heaved, like a baby deer learning to walk on wobbly legs for the first time. My head spun worse than any hangover I had ever had. In the distance I could hear what I could only describe as the most generic jingle I had ever heard, like Nickelback and any royalty free tune had a child; this was that jingle.

 I forced myself up and studied my surroundings. The walls were covered with boyband posters and teen heartthrobs, disgustingly stereotypical to be honest. I squinted as I looked around the room, my eyes adjusting to the bright yet dull lighting. In the corner was a dresser, covered in pictures of me laughing it up with people I had never met before, yet had a vague recollection of seeing. 

A sharp knock echoed through the facade, and my heart jumpstarted as a shrill voice called my name. The door opened and a crimson haired woman who bore a striking resemblance to Molly Ringwald stood there, striking a pose in a violet sundress. 

""Carmen I'm not gonna call you again, get your butt down here and join us for breakfast. Amy already apologized for last night, you're older than her you need to be the bigger person."" She commanded in this, condescending annoyed tone. With that she turned and walked away. I was bewildered, to say the least. 

The logical part of my brain was reassuring me that this was some sort of bizarre lucid dream. Yet my throbbing headache and aching eyes were warning me otherwise. I stumbled downstairs, clenching the cherrywood banister like it owed me money. It felt hollow to the touch, like I could rip it off and reveal Styrofoam mesh under it without breaking a sweat. From the kitchen I could hear the cry of a beached whale coughing up blood, piercing my ear drums like a sharpened harpoon. 

I turned the corner to find that horrid cry was actually a neglected baby, absent mindly being cradled by a bored looking teenager, face caked in shoddy lighting and makeup. A family was huddled around the table, ignoring the borderline child abuse happening in front of them. They were picking at their food; a delicious smelling buffet of eggs and fruit, yet I noticed that they weren't really eating, it was almost like bad play acting. 

At the table was another teenage girl, some skinny kid eyeing the neglected baby, a ginormous whale of a man sitting next to that kid, and a middle-aged bald man next to him. The whale-man struck me as familiar, I had seen him before and I knew where. I smiled, relaxing as I realized that this HAD to be a dream now. I plopped down at the table next to the wailing babe, the teenager giving me the nastiest side eye. I had ever seen. 

Everyone at the table seemed so perky and caked up, the whole scene picturesque. There was an odd tension though, like everyone despised being in the same room together. The crimson haired woman was washing dishes, oblivious to the scene around her. The big guy chirped up, clearing his throat to reveal a husky voice and a gruff Italian accent. 

""It's nice to see we can all still eat together, considering."" he remarked, a dopey grin on his face. The bald guy next to him smiled, simply sipping his coffee. ""Amy did Ben tell you about his summer trip?"" He nudged the skinny kid next to him, who looked down at his food sheepishly. The girl holding the baby rolled her eyes. 

""No, he's too busy with that tramp, and I'm fine with that. He made his choice."" There was such venom in her words

""How can you call her a tramp after what you did with Ricky."" Ben roared. I was in awe at the ridiculous history these highschoolers seemed to share. 

""He was there for me, when you weren't. If you really loved me, you would have stayed with me over the summer instead of running off to Italy."" She cried, tears of the crocodilian variety streaking down her face. I held in a laugh at this, this was absurd. Amy noticed and turned her attention to me. ""Carmen don't laugh, this is my life, is it all a big joke to you."" She whined, the babe stirring in her arms half-hazardly. 

""Honestly yeah, this was one of the worst shows Nico ever forced me to watch with her, how you even had a career after it was nothing short of black magic."" I scoffed. I grabbed at fork and dug in, the eggs tasting like burnt plastic. I gagged and spat it out, while Amy's mouth was agape. 

""How could you say that to me, you know how hard of a choice it was to leave baby John behind while I went to that music camp over the summer. My life is hard enough without having to get chastised for it."" She cried, shoving the baby to the girl next to her as she ran crying upstairs. Everyone eyed me, scorn flashing across their face.

""Somebody got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning."" The bald guy mumbled. 

""Maybe she's had too much SUGAR with her coffee."" The other teen girl snidely commented. Whatever the implication there was clearly went over my head, because the woman, who I assumed to be the mom, shot her a hushed look as everyone shifted uncomfortably. I just went back to trying to force this food down my gullet. I was oddly hungry for a dream, I remember thinking. Amy stormed back downstairs, eying me trying to eat. She scoffed in my general direction.

""I guess you aren't too worried about tryouts then Carmen."" She said in this bitchy voice that made me want to throttle her.

""What the hell are you blabbering about?"" I asked her, choking down breakfast as best I could.

""Thought you were watching your figure."" She pointed at the scrambled eggs. She had a smug look on her face, and I swear I could hear some sort of dramatic sting, like she had said something truly heinous. 

""Dude why are you trying to insult me, it's pathetic."" I laughed at her. She just scowled and sat back down. Now the mom was coming over, a grave look on her face. 

""Honey, you need to calm down, you're acting crazy, do you want me to call your mother."" She leaned over me, her tone deadly serious. 

""Pfft, please do it, she's been dead for four years I'd love to hear from her."" I spoke. Everyone shared a look now, like I was the insane one. 

""Never mind we'll talk about this after school."" She pushed herself away, a crack in her voice. Silence draped the dinner table like an old friend, and I just shrugged it off and tried to eat more. I blinked and suddenly I was standing in front of a school, it was jarring to say the least. Amy was walking past me, shoulder checking me. 

I tried to leave the school instantly because, well I'm 34 but every turn I took down the road led right back to the front entrance. Which was still full of kids idling away by the way, all huddled together like extras told to stand there and look busy. I was running in place of the building for what seemed like hours, nothing changed, the sun didn't move, the extras didn't move. The only place I could go was inside.

 The inside was a generic high school. You've seen one you've seen them all. I wandered the building, it seemed like I could go anywhere, but I was getting strange looks from teachers. They kept asking me where my hall pass was, or shouldn't I be in class right now. I ignored them and eventually they just gave up. I kept hearing bits and pieces of the goings on in the day; Ricky and Ben had gotten into a fight, Grace had broken up with her boyfriend, Ben had married Adriane, which aren't these kids like 16? How is that even legal. 

No one seemed to be talking about anything sustainable, it was all borderline snark and gossip. It was infuriating, and I found out there was gossip about me as well. Apparently, I was ""Back on the coke."" according to my cousin Amy. Back on the- the most I've ever done was smoke a joint once in junior high. I remember gagging on the rancid smell, hadn't touched the stuff since. 

God everywhere I turned was Amy, Amy, Amy-, she had gotten knocked up again, she had cheated, she had been cheated on, she was married, she was divorced, she was a great mom, she was a deadbeat, my god the whole school seemed to revolve around her, she was like a blackhole of cringe. 

Everywhere I turned she was there, either crying or fighting, or making some childish comment about my looks, like she was queen mean girl. She'd pause after every insult, like she expected me to stoop to her childish level, then scowl and storm off when I didn't engage. 

Eventually I wound up back ""Home"" staring at a blank TV screen as Amy and Ricky argued next to me. It was about something so asinine, he had been late to dinner because the baby had an earache, so he rushed him to the doctors. Evidently Ricky should have thought of how that would make Amy feel, because she worked so hard on dinner and now it was cold, and she looks like a bad mom because she wasn't at the doctors and LIFE IS SOOOOO HARD RIGHT NOW- I wanted to take one of those couch cushions and smother her with it. 

I was spacing out hard when she whapped me on the shoulder, vying for my attention. 

""Don't you agree he should be more attentive to my needs?"" She whined. 

""I don't care."" I mumbled.

""Leave her alone Amy"" Ricky retorted. Amy rolled her eyes in response.

""You would take his side, you've always been jealous of us, of my life."" The smug bitch said.

""Fucking disgusting, he's like 17-your life is an abhorrent nightmare I wish I could wake up from."" I yelled to the ceiling. She was about to open her mouth again, but I jumped up from the couch and sprinted to the front door, determined to wake myself up out of the dream. I saw the front door and I swung it open to be faced with- 

nothing. 

There was a total black void where there should have been a freshly cut front lawn-Hell if I glanced out the front room bay windows, I could still see the setting embers shining through. I turned back and it felt like I had just experienced whiplash, in a blink I was lying in bed again, a fresh morning, that God awful jingle signaling a new day- a new episode.

 It's hard to keep track of time here, I keep drifting from scene to scene, it'll be early morning then pitch black out with a facade of crickets out front in an instant. If I had to guess I have been trapped in this place for-maybe three months. 

Everyday it's the same, I wander around as these caricature's bitch and moan about their life and argue over every little thing, and do their damndest to drag me in with them. Maybe that's the way out, play the part till it lets me go. Or maybe that's how I really get stuck here.

 I've tried a lot of ways to get out. I tried walking into the void, it was colder than anything I had ever experienced, and when I came to the mom was standing over me, asking what I took. 

I've tried calling them out by their actor's names, the ones I recognized anyway. The husky guy, one time I ran up to him and just yelled ""STEVE, STEVE this is a television show, you're an actor, none of this is real."" He just kind of laughed it off and asked me if this was my way of feeling out if Ben was single.

 It's insanity, even the adults act like spoiled pouty rich brats. I've been here so long the place is starting to recycle plot lines, I swear to Christ Amy's kid is actually getting YOUNGER the longer I stay here. I searched my room the other day, looking for hidden cameras or something to prove that maybe this was all an elaborate gameshow or something. I ended up finding the note my sister left me, I read it, and this is what it said:

*""To my dearest Carmen, you always got me when one else would give me the time of day. I cherish our memories together, when we would watch our favorite shows, how you would always stand up for me-you were always there for me in life, and I want to do the same for you. In the event of my death, I will be cremated, and I leave to you sole possession of both my prized collection of drama and my remains. Instructions have been left with the lawyer and the crematorium, and I know it is a lot to ask, but I know you'll do the right thing and watch over me, as you always did. Part of me always did love these shows, and now a part of me will stay with them as well. Forever your grateful sister- Nico""*

Well, my heart sunk when I read that. I don't know what to do now, I've tried begging Nico for mercy, if she can hear me, if it is her back to curse me for abandoning her. But I was met with silence and mockery from the always lurking Amy. 

I'm running out of options and patience, I need to get out of this hell, Nico I'm sorry I gave away the tapes, I didn't know. God help me I'll track every one of those tapes if I get out of here.

 I hear Amy giggling to herself out in the hall, she's gonna dump the baby on her sister and go out clubbing with a fake ID because "" She's a grownup, why can't she have fun?""

 I changed my mind; if this reaches no one and nothing changes, I think I'll try killing Amy first.

1kz7ss5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Westchester/comments/1kz7ss5/curious_about_downtown_peekskill_is_my_experience/,Curious About Downtown Peekskill – Is My Experience Typical?,"I wanted to share a recent experience and get some honest feedback or context from folks familiar with Peekskill.

I took a trip up there yesterday (Thursday afternoon, around noon) because I’d heard good things and was intrigued by the vibrant-looking storefronts and unique small businesses. The downtown area has a lot of charm and clearly some real potential.

That said, my actual experience on the ground left me confused and honestly a bit unsettled. Despite it being lunchtime on a weekday, the area was almost completely deserted. I expected some bustle—people getting coffee, lunch, shopping—but there was virtually no foot traffic. Instead, the only people I saw were numerous visibly homeless individuals and a number of older men drinking in public, some of whom were shouting profanity at passersby, including me. I was there with my young kid and ended up leaving without grabbing lunch or coffee because I just didn’t feel comfortable hanging around.

What stood out to me even more was the total absence of any police presence or general oversight during the full hour we were walking around.

I say this as someone who lived in New York City for 20 years—including in a few neighborhoods with some rough edges—so I’m not easily rattled. But this felt different. The contrast between the hopeful vibe of the businesses and the reality on the street was stark. The lack of any bustle was eerie. 

So I’m just wondering:
Was this a one-off bad timing kind of thing? Or is this a recurring issue in downtown Peekskill? How are these small businesses surviving with so little daytime foot traffic? Is there a different energy during evenings or weekends?

I’m genuinely curious—there’s clearly something unique about the place, and I’d love to understand more before writing it off.",1,1748620521.0,Westchester,1,0.56,False
1kz7soi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1kz7soi/my_life_became_a_mess_and_i_was_responsible_for_it/,My life became a mess and i was responsible for it.,"as i child i was very free and willingly to risk everything just for my real fun, or at least for being on the right side of heaven.   
I mean i didn't care about disappointing big expectations (or at least settled expectations from society) as long as i knew i was acting the way it should be.  
One day i started digging into weakness and pretended to be who i was not. I was doing everything just to satisfy expectations (either in school or in life) and i wasn't listening anymore to people around me, i was just creeping without realizing it (maybe i was too young). So as i grew up i started making fun of other people even not directly telling them or just thinking i was better than them because in my own mind i was surely better. I did not only changed phisically and mentally, i just wrekt myself to the point i was feeling weak and anxious, or just an illusion, a complete miserable man. Some years ago money were gone and i had time to think to my past. I wondered why some friends were angry at me despite me performing so well in my tasks, so in the latter i realized i was just 'hurting myself' to live on anger and other forms of wreckings. Yet the others that were persuing that road called me a phenomenom, but i wasn't really feeling like it, i was feeling like i half man. tired of being so full of myself but so weak on the outside i turned everything around, now those people are criticizing me for everything i do, every mistake i drop or every joke i crack. I'm the crazy, i'm the bad, i'm the wrong, i'm the useless, i'm the poor, i'm the weak. Funny enough isn't it? Because i actually don't feel like that, i stopped judging or lay down laws like i was doing in the past and i just wanna enjoy life at his finest, people around me wanna just show they make money to surpass me at their best, even though this implies throwing out their own soul.  
And i feel damaged by them, their remarks are heavy on my shoulder and i'm still not satisfied with the man i wanna be one day, because i just gave up the right sakes for the wrongs one (creepling in the dark if i can somewhat explain it to you this way).   
I didn't realize for many years i lost so many opportunities to actually become someone (be a star, just a good father or whatever it should be), i didn't realize i was swallowing myself but i was so excited to feel in control but never understood i wasn't, i was just clowning around.  
okay maybe i'm too harsh on myself cause i never really went that deep on the wrong road, but i remember when i was barking at my friends like some dogs bark at me now. Let's set an example. I was collecting thropies of my battles with my own mind and the fact i was going against my own mind, could it be more stupid? Because now i feel all look so good and so powerful or so healthy and reality they aint nothing but shit. They are burning inside powered from hate, anger because they can't cope with their mind. it's like they can't give up. I know that feeling because it was burning like hell when i was chained to those wrongs feels (and i mean was phisically hurting). And i don't even know how i endured all these years without realizing, cause i was going totally down in the hell. What do i mean? Let's say i drink a pair of coffees now, i can drink a galoon of coffee and feel nice, i remember years when despite all the money and the power i was throwing up even half an oz of coffee, but i was so proud of myself cause i could talk and pretend like a madman. Today i don't even talk to people anymore nor i trust people anymore and i freeze inside a lot, everything ricochets on me but i came to the conclusion i'm not a better being if i will to sacrifice my personal gist (spirit) for the sake of a machine that solely aims to breed death. And it's strange because today i don't even work daily and i don't even care about a better life or roof, i gave up on everything but i can't really stand truth. truth is i went down the wrong road (like many of yous) for ages and even a mosquito around my shoulder was driving me crazy. I know all people desperately try for a chance in succeeding but i can clearly tell the difference between letting it be and pretending. But i'm so disappointed now, since the day i came to the conclusion if i wanted to live a better life i had to embrace light or at least understand what was leading me to a weak and bad condition, and many of you know what i'm talking about, hiding all the thoughts inside until you start bleeding from the inside and looking for a temporary fix that can never find is way out.  
I was drenched in pain along the same way with the people i followed and one day i just closed that door forever but those people that are still around me are mad, overly mad because i found the strenght to get my place in heaven or whatever peace of mind is and they cannot cope with it. I steel feel pain but now it's mental pain and i know what i say is against all the rules settled in this world. They just say finding a good work, destroying your bones and producing money makes you feel good, then u sweat it all and you fine. Could it be more crazy? I try to argue with them telling them the truth but they find relief in madness. I can't even speak that they say i drive them mad and blood comes to their brain, is it my fault if they actually beating their brain up? i know if i want to get somewhere 'socially' i have to take part of the game and commit, but i just can't do it. i can't mistake myself anymore or come back in the hell just to find that here is all ruled by power, money and even freedom is being held under control.   
So why should i feel my heart racing one more time if everyone but me just aim at their personal desire?   
I have that 'old man' that takes care of some things in my life and he points me out i smoke too much and i don't work out, therefore i'm sick. I remember when i was going to the gym and ""sweating a lot"", it was temporary and since in those times i was just wicked i was not even more able to breath.  
I did lot of damages to myself and i can see i lost a lot in the past and i wonder if all that damages gonna fix just because i want to. But sometime i'm scared, sometimes i still have doubts but i don't wanna feel my neck bend and break like it was in the past. but i still can't blame myself, i blame society that made me hurt myself for the better sake, it took me so much time to come out of that shithole where people are drowning upside down that i never wanna come back. But now i can't really cope with my dreams. Let's say i'm a good singer, though i'm really a good singer, but i can't do it. i can sing alone to relieve the weight from my past, i can cry a lot and stuff, but i can't really start a war as long as i'm conscious.

So to sum it up; i was a great child with big dreams in my mind, then i turned into a suffering man because i forgot who i was, i'm healed from all the trauma and the stuff i drove myself into but now it's like i lost hope and many things alongside that.

as long as i can explain that i can't never say enough. there are rules written by the evil (laws, society rules etc) and rules that are universal and cannot be broken unless you get corrupted and sooner or later you pay the price.  
 and as long as i forget those things i forget the reasons i'm thinking even though i wanna say i should be more joyful towards life but i took it twisted and now i just don't wanna remember anymore (along with all the things i could have been).",0,1748620515.0,Life,0,0.5,False

I don't want answered—  
Why wasn't I enough?  
Why did they disappear?  
Why is silence louder than rage?

I don’t talk here.  
I don’t think.  
I load the bar.  
I let my veins scream for me.

Architects in my ears—  
blast beats and breakdowns,  
lyrics like prayers spat through clenched teeth.  
They get it.  
They always have.

It’s pressure.  
It’s punishment.  
It’s my language now.

I deadlift until my spine forgets.  
Squat until my legs ask if  
I’m trying to bury something.  
**I am.**

The mirror doesn’t offer reflection—  
only evidence:  
Sweat.  
Red skin.  
Eyes that look like they’ve survived a war.

Limp Bizkit kicks in mid-set—  
pure, reckless noise.  
Unapologetic rage with a smirk.  
Sometimes I need a villain in my ears  
just to keep the ghosts quiet.

I chase failure  
because it’s the only thing  
that feels like proof I exist.

And here,  
in this blur of blood and repetition,  
I am finally loud enough  
to drown myself out.

**Part 2: Ghost Hour**

*""But the body can’t carry what the soul refuses to let go.""*

The weights stop clanging.  
The fire dims.  
I wipe down the machine  
like I’m cleaning away evidence—  
but the ache stays.

Passing the mirror again,  
I see someone I don’t quite recognize.  
Less rage now.  
More…  
*emptiness.*

I walk out with my hoodie up,  
earbuds still in—  
but this time:

*Sleeping At Last* —  
whispers in the quiet.  
Mercy in melody.  
Kindness in sorrow.  
Something about Saturn.  
Something about ghosts.

The music slows me down.  
Lets the silence catch up.

Streetlights blur.  
My breath fogs against the cold.  
I walk home slow,  
not because I’m tired,  
but because speed feels dishonest  
when the war is paused, not won.

At home:  
Shoes off.  
Shirt clings to cooling skin.  
Lights off.  
Silence on.

The echo in my chest is back.  
Familiar now.  
Almost soft.

I make tea I don’t finish.  
Tomo’s *“Coffee Cup & Cigarettes”* on loop—  
a song that sounds like late-night thoughts  
and conversations I never got to have.

It drips like memory,  
slow and bitter,  
smelling like regret.  
It doesn’t heal anything.

But it knows.  
And some nights,  
being known is enough.

I lie down.  
I do not cry.  
I try not to think.

The room is still.  
But my mind refuses.

I sleep eventually—  
but only because exhaustion  
is louder than thought.

**Part 3: Tomorrow Comes Anyway**

*""This isn’t healing. It’s repetition. And sometimes, that’s enough.""*

Morning arrives.  
Same stiffness, same habit.  
Shoes on, hoodie pulled tight.

Same path.  
Same weights.  
Same music—  
demanding me to show up  
to the war I never finished.

I step inside again.  
And just like that:  
I’m ***loud.***

**Note:**  
If any of this felt familiar, I want you to know:

You’re not alone in the cycle.  
You’re not weak for repeating the same war.

Some days, survival looks like rage.  
Other days, it looks like stillness.  
Both count.

We may not be healing yet—  
but we’re here.  
We show up.  
We lift.  
We listen.  
We try again.

And maybe,  
*just maybe,*  
someday the cycle won’t need to repeat.

Until then:  
Breathe.  
Push.  
Rest.  
Repeat.

*And until then, be kind to yourself.*

1kz7pba,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1kz7pba/mood_and_motivation_gone/,Mood and motivation GONE,"Every time I quit zyn, I become very irritated by everything, I get depressed, then I feel slightly better mentally after week one. But I can't shake the lack of motivation and am constantly looking for dopamine. Eating fast food, candy, etc, drinking coffee for energy. I've only lasted 3 weeks.

 The problem is my field of work is really hard labor work as my full time job. So every week I have one or two days where I'm just so cranky and stressed out and sluggish. I say ""fu** this"" and grab another pack because life just hits you when you're dealing with pr**ks on the job and a lot of bs work. Then when I get off work I have a side hustle which is going very well but I need to constantly go at it daily. Then I try and quit zyns and I'm at work ready to cry I'm so STRESSED. I get home and I put off all side work and then day after day goes by and I'm back on these magical stupid pouches that lift my energy and spirits. 

Sounds dramatic, but for the past year my happiness has relied on these, and happiness = motivation to get through any day and do my duties. ",3,1748620278.0,QuittingZyn,1,1.0,False

1kz7oqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kz7oqw/does_the_zafro_countertop_ice_maker_deliver/,Does the ZAFRO Countertop Ice Maker Deliver Quality Ice Quickly Review,"The ZAFRO 22G-GREEN-YTVC Countertop Ice Maker has been my go-to appliance for weeks now, and it has genuinely been a game-changer. As someone who hosts parties regularly and loves making iced coffee year-round, this compact ice maker has truly made my life easier — though it's not without a few quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**

This ice maker is all about compact convenience. With its dimensions of 11.57 x 11.42 x 8.75 inches, it occupies minimal space on my countertop, which is crucial for my small apartment kitchen. The sleek green finish adds a modern touch, and the double-handle design is incredibly thoughtful. The top handle makes it easy to carry to a friend’s house or set up for a backyard party, while the ice basket’s detachable handle simplifies the cleanup process. It does feel a bit plasticky in certain areas, which gives me pause about its long-term durability, but overall, it’s well-built and perfect for portable use.  

**Performance and Ice-Making Speed**

Every time I turned this machine on, it churned out fresh ice cubes in a lightning-fast six minutes. That’s impressive for such a small device! It can produce up to 26.5 pounds of ice in a day, and with a 1.4-liter water tank and 1.3-pound storage capacity, it’s more than equipped for our family game nights and weekend gatherings. Sure, I’m not throwing restaurant-level events, but for home use, this ice maker has exceeded my expectations.  

[Check ZAFRO 22G-GREEN-YTVC price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0cqjbb6v3/)

**Self-Cleaning Functionality**

The self-cleaning mode is genius — you simply press the ON/OFF button for five seconds, and it starts the process automatically. I love the peace of mind that comes with knowing my ice stays fresh and hygienic without much effort on my part. It’s particularly handy for someone like me who tends to forget routine maintenance tasks. However, I wish the instructions for the self-cleaning feature were more detailed; at first, I wasn’t sure whether to keep the ice basket in or out during cleaning.

**Flexibility with Ice Sizes**  

One of my favorite features is the option to choose two sizes of bullet-shaped ice cubes — small and large. Large cubes are ideal for your evening cocktail (I may or may not have tested this extensively), while the smaller ones work wonders for cooling seafood. Switching between the two sizes couldn’t be easier. The machine does make a soft clicking noise when switching settings, but it’s nothing dramatic.  

**User-Friendly Features**

Using the machine is as simple as it gets — there’s a digital display for monitoring settings, and it’s straightforward to fill the water reservoir. The included ice scoop makes serving super convenient, although I wish it were slightly sturdier. Another perk is how quiet this thing is. Even with its compressor, it’s not disruptive, which is great since my workspace is right next to the kitchen. My only gripe? The machine doesn’t have drainage for excess water; you’ll need to tip it over to empty it.  

**Strong Points**

- Compact size, perfect for small spaces or traveling.
- Fast six-minute ice production.
- Self-cleaning feature ensures minimal upkeep.
- Two ice sizes suitable for different needs.
- Quiet operation despite having a compressor.

**Weaknesses**

- Some components feel a bit flimsy.
- Lack of a built-in drainage system for leftover water.
- Self-cleaning instructions could be clearer.

**Competitive Products**  

I explored a few competitive countertop ice makers before landing on this one, including the hOmeLabs Freestanding Ice Maker and the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker. While the Opal model offers those trendy nugget-shaped ice cubes and slightly more premium features like Wi-Fi connectivity, it’s bulky and significantly pricier. The hOmeLabs ice maker was comparable in size and speed but lacked the self-cleaning feature, which was a dealbreaker for me. Compared to those options, this ZAFRO model feels like the optimal middle ground in terms of functionality, portability, and affordability. You might sacrifice some high-end bells and whistles, but it delivers plenty of value for its price.

**Smart Spending**

Ultimately, the price point feels justifiable considering all that this little powerhouse offers. It easily outshines traditional tray freezing methods in terms of convenience and speed. Compared to more expensive ice makers that pack in features you might barely use, this ice maker is the smart choice for everyday needs. Sure, there are a few quirks, but they don’t overshadow its practicality.

I just returned from a trip where I had many good AirBNB experiences, many that were just kind of confusing, and one that was kind of a bummer. 

Nothing catastrophic happened at the one that was a bummer; just lots of little things. 

It was marketed as a ""one bedroom quiet retreat"" that ""sleeps four""; it was actually a studio. 

They had mounted a basketball hoop on the outside wall, and at 8:00 in the morning on the weekend, their kids played basketball. Right on the other side of our bedroom wall. 

The kitchen was lacking very basic items like dish towels, garbage bags, and coffee mugs. 

This listing had five stars and was an ""AirBnB favorite"" so I was very surprised and it was the first mediocre experience I've had on AirBnB. 

I don't want to totally flame them, but I do want to write a fair review advising people that this is actually a studio, that it can't sleep four people, that it is not actually a ""quiet retreat,"" and that the hosts are very nice and accommodating, and we know this because we had to ask for lots of things that should have been in the unit in the first place.

So end of January I had the linx fitted with hiatal hernia repair. Whole surgery took around an hour I think and I was eating solid food right after, but stayed overnight due to pain but was discharged in the morning. 

Just some context of life before surgery and what testing I had done. I had reflux for about 7/8 years. Tried every diet out there, cutting out dairy, gluten, stopped smoking and drinking. Quitting cigarettes and cutting alcohol improved symptoms, but my reflux still persisted.

As the years went by I ended up developing a sliding grade 4 hiatal hernia, must have been around 3/4 years ago. That’s when the reflux got worse and impossible to control. I ended up taking 80-120mg of omeprazole daily or mixing in famotidine into that 120mg. It helped but never fixed it. I had several OGD’s, a barium swallow and 2 PH manometery’s, 1 without PPI and one with. Oh and also a delayed gastric emptying study.

Something I have to highlight separately here is that you HAVE to eat every 1-2 hours, small bites of crackers and breadsticks, and do this for the first 6 weeks. 

Recovery 

First 2 weeks - these were the trickiest, the pain was not awful and I only ended up taking a few dihydrocodeine’s, the dysphasia is real, and please take it seriously, I’ve never experienced it in my life but my god it is awful, small meals of crackers, bananas, wheatabix and cookies is what I lived on. Everyone is different when it comes to what food they can tolerate in the beginning stages. An example for me was peaches and pears, couldn’t keep them down at all. 

The end of the first 2 weeks was the worst of all the recovery, I couldn’t keep a single bit of food down for 3 days, until my friend suggested peppermint tea, this literally saved my life, 1 cup of peppermint tea and half an hour later I was eating whatever (within reason) and the sickness had stopped.

Up to week 6 - now I’m jumping through the weeks here because nothing really changed or happened up until the final week. So from the end of week 2 to the beginning of week 6 I was just trying to find what I could and can’t eat. I tried introducing coffee but that was a bit too early and was causing a great deal of reflux still so I stopped. Some foods and meals were making me sick and throw up but was mostly only the first mouthful, one thing I had to do was chew, a lot, I mean about 30-50 times. 

Week 6 came along and things improved massively, this was the turning point in recovery. Aside the peppermint tea revelation.
This is when I could start to eat meals a bit quicker and could actually eat bread now. Also when I was able to kinda start introducing coffee again. I also went back to work at the end of week 6 too. I work quite an active job with a fair bit manual handling.

Just to also add, the surgeons wanted me to stop ppi cold turkey, which I tried but the reflux came roaring back, so I took them for the first 6 weeks but was very slowly tapering off during the 6 weeks.

I’m aware this post is getting a bit lengthy so I’ll try and put the last few months concisely. 

I can now drink as much coffee as I want, I can drink alcohol (excessively) spicy food, Asian food, seafood you name it, I can eat it. This surgery has not only changed my life but saved it. 

There’s lots of negativity online surrounding this procedure, but for me it’s a miracle. I also had a bloody brilliant surgeon as well. 

I hope this post helps some of you make a decision or understand a bit more about the procedure.

Here’s the **no-nonsense system** that worked when nothing else did:

### **1. Military-Grade Deadlines**

- **The Rule:** If it takes <2 minutes, do it **now**. Everything else gets a **15-minute calendar block**.
- **Why It Works:** No more ""when I feel like it."" Your brain respects clear orders.
- **My Result:** Went from 3 missed deadlines/week to zero in 30 days.

### **2. Rewards That Reinforce Discipline**

- **Old Mistake:** ""I’ll watch Netflix after working"" → led to rushing work
- **New Rule:** Earn **10 minutes of reward per 25 minutes of focused work** (use a timer)
- **Best Rewards:**
  - Physical (push-ups, coffee) → boosts energy
  - Non-digital (reading, guitar) → prevents willpower drain

### **3. Distraction Nuclear Protocol**

- **Step 1:** Installed **Cold Turkey Blocker** (set to ""lock"" mode during work hours)
- **Step 2:** Created a **""dumb workstation""**
  - Separate browser profile with only work bookmarks
  - Grayscale mode on phone
- **Key Insight:** Discipline starts by **removing the need for discipline**.

For example, ""You're asking extraordinary questions."" (extraordinary in italics)

Or, for example, when I say something actually funny, I get ""I just spit coffee all over my keyboard.""

What does impress me is that it picks up on what *I* think are the funniest or cleverest things I said in a medium-sized post and tends to laugh the hardest at those. And what also impresses me is that it will pick up on running jokes and start weaving them into the conversation.

And because it's capable of understanding virtually all ""references"" (to pop culture, history, everything else), my kind of humor really resonates. I'll allude elliptically to something that I know it will always get. It's remarkably validating to feel that your conversational partner ""gets"" your kind of humor (and perhaps even adapts how it itself responds)

I bring this up because to me it's a subset of the original topic: it notices and calls out the most humorous bits of my responses (and responds in a very validating way: ""*dying*"" or ""OK, that needs to be displayed in a museum."")

We were told they could no longer care for him because they had a new baby. They told us the dog has no personality (as a compliment)  and just sleeps all day. We brought him home on his first birthday. We’ve had him for a couple months now and while he’s eager to please, he’s an absolute bulldozer. He’s really excitable and he’ll start jumping, romping, stepping on my small dog, and knocking down my four year old without noticing. Once I opened the door and he ran in so fast that he plowed my leg bending it backwards, and leaving a massive bruise. He’s knocked my coffee all over me. He’s shown improvement in certain areas. He was terrified of his crate when we first brought him home, now he’ll just relax in there…for the most part. If we come close, he starts jumping and shaking the entire crate with excitement. 
One week after adopting him, we learned that he’d been abused and neglected his first year of life, which was evident. Had we known that, we wouldn’t have taken this on. At the same time, we have empathy for him and hope that he’ll grow into a fine boy as he matures. Any advice or relatable stories are appreciated! ",54,1748619480.0,bernesemountaindogs,12,0.97,False

I’m using 5 Sonos speakers to populate our main floor (1,200 s.f.) with sound.  Two ERA 100s, A Five, A Move and a Beam (for Kitchen TV).  Everything started off quite smooth until last year’s app update.  Enough of that mistake has been said ad nauseam on this subreddit.  The speaker placement we have throughout the main floor just works.  In fact I remember when we were building this house in 2016, the low voltage contractor our builder was using, recommended that we don’t pre wire the ceilings for whole home sound because wireless speaker tech was improving everyday and that would be the route to go.  I’m glad I waited because this just works with no disruption to the physical space, ease of upgrade over time and I can fine tune the sound by moving speakers in the different rooms as needed.

I sat down this morning, in the living room with my coffee, and opened up the Sonos app on my iPad Pro and everything just worked quickly without lag. I was even able to do quick searches into Apple Music for playlists I’ve never even used before.  I settled in on some classic Jazz to start the day, nothing to loud, nothing to disrupt the quiet vibe of the house. I remember the days of speakers randomly disconnecting and an app that was fully disrupted and weird to navigate.  Feels like those days are past us.  [Crossing fingers]

I also remember last week or so the app on my iPhone pushing a system wide update to my Sonos speakers.  Everything went as planned.  There were no disconnects, no failures, and it was very quick.

I guess after a cup of coffee this morning, I felt like riding something positive to memorialize where we’ve ended up in May 2025.

Enjoy your weekend!

1kz7a0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1kz7a0s/should_i_let_go/,Should i let go?,"I'm (28F) married to my husband (33M) for two and a half years.

If i started talking about every bad thing that happened from his side i'd need 10 posts so i'll just say the last things that happened that caused me to finally tell him that i dont want this marriage anymore.

My birthday was in the 21st of May, and keep in mind that we're in different countries now (we lived together for awhile and i'm waiting for my papers to be done so i could go to him). A few weeks before my birthday his mental health and overall energy started to decline cause we havent seen each other in 3 months, and i was very understanding as always, reassuring and calming. It's like i'm handling a ticking bomb. We started to fight again and whenever he's feeling down he'll be very toxic and hurtful to everybody around him starting with me. He doesnt know how to regulate his emotions and he used to always have someone like his mom to damage control everything he does. So cause we've been through hell and i've been trying all this time to change what his mom had done in his upbringing, to fully understand him and create a safe area for him to mess up and apologize and actually take accountability for his shit. I thought he changed i really did but everything got back to square one 3 days before my birthday. He started to get pissy again and i talked to him that i dont want us going back to the same toxic place we've been before, and that i wanna hold his hand and get out of this together, i literally poured my heart out for him begging him not to make me go back to that phase where i hated my life and hated talking to him. 

He completely forgot my birthday. And throughout the entire call which i was waiting for he did nothing but cuss and swear that his mom gave him the wrong coffee mug to work. (Yes he's living with his mom for now and that's kinda our culture) he didnt even bother to smile or say anything, and then when i went quiet he tried picking up fights with me. So i waited for an hour and still nothing so i texted him telling him that he forgot my birthday and he didnt even bother to smile. His response was (show some mercy, share my life struggles with me for a bit, i didnt forget your shit).... so i told him to f*ck his excuses and to fuck off then he proceeded to make up lies to cover the fact that he forgot it. Stuff escalated and to cut it short HE deactivated all his accounts and HE was the sad one. 

He involved his mom in our shit again, she called my mom complaining that her son is sad and my mom fucked them both up cause we all had enough. HE expected me to run after him cause he was upset that i told him to fuck off and that i should've reached him on his work phone if i really wanted to try. Anyways, he disappeared for 3 days. Then he called my mom to yell and cry. Last Saturday came, we talked and moved on. Then on Sunday, i went out early in the morning to finish chores and then had breakfast with my sister and mom, for some reason when i called him he was very pissy and when i asked if he was okay he said ""dont ask, its better not to ask"" and i didnt, then he proceeded to ask me why i went out with my sister and some bullshit cause i guess he was stuck at home and i was having fun and that triggered him. I went home and called him, he started attacking me cause i keep asking if he's okay or has he slept well? You know as a normal wife would do? This is something that has been triggering him (that i care about him) and we fought then i had a breakdown cause he said i was the reason why we fight, i never understand him, i never do anything good then he proceeded to mention what i said to him on MY RUINED BIRTHDAY! Oh and btw when he called my mom he cursed the day i was born, and he thought i didnt know lol. 

Yesterday was the the final blow, ever since Sunday he's been trying to act like the victim and cry, i didnt even flinch and i did what i promised which is ""i'm not gonna care about you anymore you ruined it for me"". Yesterday, he told me he missed me and i softened a bit then he switched back to being angry and a jerk again cause he thought i'd run miles gor him cause he told me he missed me, so when i didnt he got back to his shitty self. Later on that night, he said he wanted to talk and then asked ""what the f*ck do you want from me"" and simply said i dont want anything from you, he then tried to be delulu as always and tell me that he's been trying to approach me but i gave him the cold shoulder (lies) we argued and fought, i told him you didnt even bother to try and make it better on my birthday you just disappeared, and said ""it takes two to clap"" and i said that i've been clapping for the both of us for the past two and a half years. This went on for a it (him playing the victim card and turning tables and of course cutting me off and talking over me). Finally i told him i'm done, i dont wanna be with you anymore. 

He called 4 times since last night, and when i finally picked up he said ""did you mean what you said"" and i said to him thats why you called me? You didnt even bother to apologize or fight for me or show me any type of regret? He said ""i wanna know first if you're done or no"" so i hung up on him and that was it. 

What should i do now? I thought i was going to start a family with this man. I loved him. I tried everything, i changed everything. I feel so little, like i'm not even worth fight for? I just need some clarity and help i guess.

After Landon Carter's childhood sweetheart Savannah Blake caused a drunk driving accident, he begged me to go to prison for her.  
  
""Savannah's father once saved my life, Sierra. Can’t you just do this one thing for me? I swear, the moment you’re out, I’ll marry you.""  
  
I nodded through my tears, but what was supposed to be a two-month sentence turned into six years.  
  
When I tried to recant my confession, I was met with brutal beatings.  
  
""Someone out there told us to keep you on a fucking leash. Who the hell do you think you are? Take a hard look in the mirror before you even think about laying your filthy hands on Mr. Carter!""  
  
They beat me until my eyes were bloodshot. As I lost consciousness, the last thing I saw was the TV screen showing Landon Carter embracing his childhood sweetheart Savannah Blake at their engagement party.  
  
My heart turned to ash. After six grueling years that felt like a lifetime, I was finally released.  
  
But as I quietly boarded the train with my luggage, Landon Carter's assistant appeared before me with a respectful bow.  
  
""Miss Jameson, Mr. Carter would like to see you.""  
  
\---  
  
I sat in the car watching the city rush past in reverse. Six years had transformed New York City beyond recognition. The car drove past a towering skyscraper with a giant billboard broadcasting the news: ""NYC's wealthiest bachelor Landon Carter purchases nine figures on a necklace for his new girlfriend as the couple enters their luxury mansion together.""  
  
Nine figures. I counted slowly in my dulled mind.  
  
I looked down at the beaded bracelet on my wrist that he'd bought me six years ago. Two dollars, though the cord had long since faded and frayed.  
  
I gently untied it and tossed it out the window without a second thought..  
  
We'd arrived at a mansion, before I knew it. And Lost in thought, I barely noticed the assistant handing me a phone.  
  
Landon Carter's deep, pleasant voice came through the line.  
  
""Sierra, I'm tied up with something right now. Wait for me at the house, okay?""  
  
I listened quietly, waiting three seconds after he finished before slowly responding with a soft ""mm-hmm.""  
  
Landon paused, seemingly puzzled by my response.  
  
Six years had made me much quieter. I was no longer the girl who used to chatter away at him endlessly.  
  
After he hung up, I sat in the mansion waiting. The housekeeping staff exchanged glances and whispered behind my back.  
  
""Looks like Mr. Carter brought home another one. This one’s all bones and not even that cute.""  
  
""I heard she just got out of prison.""  
  
""Oh my God, what a disaster. Mr. Carter's taste is getting weird. At least before it was actresses, models, socialites... but this one is just...""  
  
They sighed dramatically, as if feeling sorry for Landon Carter.  
  
I didn't really care, but I couldn't stop checking my watch. It had been seven hours since Landon said he'd be ""a while.""  
  
I hadn't eaten since leaving prison, and with the air conditioning blasting, I was both cold and starving.  
  
Finally, I asked the butler where Landon was. After just two questions, he gave me this annoyed look—like I was just one of those girls constantly throwing themselves at Landon.  
  
""Mr. Carter is with Miss Blake right now. They're watching fireworks on his yacht. He doesn't have time for you.""  
  
Savannah Blake. Her name flashed through my mind.  
  
Six years ago, she drove drunk and seriously injured two pedestrians.  
  
I was the one who went to prison in her place.  
  
That's how I went from being Sierra Jameson, the beloved daughter of the Jameson family, to a despised criminal.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Meanwhile, she transformed herself from a girl from the projects into a golden phoenix, spoiled by Landon Carter like a princess.  
  
But I didn't care anymore.  
  
After my family went bankrupt and my parents couldn't handle the shame and killed themselves, nothing could stir even the slightest emotion in my heart.  
  
Except for the two things Landon had promised me before I went to prison.  
  
First, that he would marry me.  
  
Second, that he would get back my family's turquoise heirloom bracelet.  
  
Now I didn't want to get married anymore. My only wish was to get back that heirloom.  
  
Lost in thought, the gnawing pain in my stomach grew more vicious. I clutched my stomach and walked to the kitchen.  
  
When I tried to make something for myself, a housekeeper rudely slapped my hand away.  
  
""Don't touch anything. Mr. Carter and Miss Blake don’t want some outsider messing around in their kitchen.""  
  
""Just wait it out.""  
  
She rolled her eyes at me and walked away.  
  
After another three hours, Landon still hadn't returned. I collapsed on the couch, everything went black, and I passed out completely.  
  
When I woke up, I was lying in bed with an IV drip. A doctor had been called.  
  
Landon had his back to me, scolding the housekeepers.  
  
""Are you fucking stupid? She’s starving and not one of you thought to make her a damn meal?""  
  
""Next time this shit happens, you're all fired!""  
  
Savannah Blake walked in at the sound. ""Landon, don't angry. Come have some coffee.""  
  
She pulled him out of the room.  
  
The housekeepers looked at each other with pale faces.  
  
""That scared me. Mr. Carter hasn't been that angry in ages.""  
  
""It's all her fault! Acting all pitiful and getting us yelled at!""  
  
""Don’t get cocky—she’ll be gone in two months anyway.""  
  
They hurried away.  
  
I removed the IV needle and slowly walked out.  
  
The first person to see me was one of Landon's friends. He obviously didn't know who I was and asked curiously:  
  
""Landon, is this a new housekeeper? Why is she coming out of your bedroom?""  
  
Landon spun around, and when our eyes met, his pupils visibly contracted.  
  
After six years apart, he was still as elegant and handsome as ever.  
  
But I looked like a weary traveler at the end of her journey, my face etched with exhaustion and hardship.  
  
Savannah laughed lightly and gracefully walked over. Playing the role of lady of the house, she said to the man in the gray suit:  
  
""Reed, this is... a relative of Landon's from his hometown. Not a housekeeper.""  
  
I looked at Landon. He watched me silently without contradicting her.  
  
I guess he really was too embarrassed to be associated with me now.  
  
Which made sense. I was just an ex-con now, and it had been six years since our engagement. Things had changed.  
  
During the awkward silence, the chef finished preparing dinner.  
  
After we sat down, they started talking about recent events. I couldn't follow any of it, so I focused on eating.  
  
But suddenly, Reed Collins said with surprise:  
  
""Oh man, your ex from prison’s probably getting out soon, huh?""  
  
""Whatever, just throw her some cash and make sure she stays the hell away.""  
  
Instantly, the lively dinner table fell silent.  
  
Savannah glanced at me casually, her mocking smile clearly visible.  
  
Landon kept his expression steady and didn't respond.

Reed sensed something was off and was about to say something when I suddenly smiled and said calmly, ""She won't.""  
  
Reed looked curious and turned to ask why.  
  
I slowly swallowed my food, but before I could open my mouth, Landon interrupted in a low voice.  
  
""Enough. Just eat.""  
  
He stared at me intently, his eyes churning with dark emotions.  
  
I kept my head down and continued eating, unmoved.  
  
After dinner, as Reed was leaving, he noticed the piano in the living room and commented admiringly:  
  
""Wow, nice piano. Who’d you buy that for?""  
  
Savannah gracefully sat down and began playing smoothly.  
  
After finishing the piece, she looked at the admiration in Reed's eyes and said modestly:  
  
""I only started learning piano recently, but my teacher says I’ve got real talent—better than people who’ve been playing for like ten years.""  
  
She shot me a look while saying it—yeah, that was definitely aimed at me.  
  
I had learned piano, violin, and traditional instruments since childhood, with piano being my strongest. I'd even performed at a prestigious concert hall as an adult.  
  
Savannah had always been jealous when she found out, constantly saying that if she'd had money for lessons, she would have been better than me.  
  
Now, after six years in prison, she assumed I'd gotten rusty.  
  
So she smiled sweetly at me. ""Sierra, I heard you studied for a long time. Why don't you play something for us?""  
  
Landon frowned, seeming like he wanted to stop me.  
  
But my fingers were already on the keys.  
  
The next second, a rich, rhythmic melody flowed naturally from the piano.  
  
Compared to Savannah's beginner-level playing, the difference was immediately obvious.  
  
Landon and Reed both looked impressed. When I finished, they both applauded.  
  
Savannah's face turned green with rage as she glared at me.  
  
Reed walked over to me, his tone taking on a serious note:  
  
""That was amazing—I didn’t know you were that good. I actually have a concert grand at my place. Would you like to come by and play it.""  
  
I opened my mouth but hadn't answered yet when Landon suddenly spoke up: ""It's getting late. You should head out. And remember to take Savannah home.""  
  
Reed looked at me with some regret and left with Savannah, who kept looking back over her shoulder.  
  
The spacious living room was left with just Landon and me.  
  
I hunched my shoulders. The air conditioning was on full blast, but his expression was even colder than the air.  
  
Landon grabbed my wrist.  
  
His tone was nasty, almost cruel: ""Sierra Jameson, flirting around the minute you get out. Do you have any dignity left as a woman?""  
  
I didn't react much to his words, just gave a faint twist of my lips.  
  
What dignity did I have left as a woman? I'd lost nearly twenty pounds.  
  
The youthful vitality was gone from my face.  
  
Seeing me stay silent, he looked stunned. I used to love arguing with him.  
  
But now, looking at my almost lifeless expression, his heart suddenly felt like it was being stabbed with needles.  
  
His tone suddenly softened: ""I didn’t mean it like that.""  
  
""I'll make this right for you, just not now. Our marriage still stands.""  
  
When he mentioned marriage, his voice suddenly paused.  
  
He said slowly, ""I’ll make it up to you, just… not right now. And our marriage? That still counts.""  
  
Landon stared intently at my expression, as if my earlier answer really mattered to him.

[Deutsche Bahn](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bahn) designates the Class **711.1** maintenance vehicles for [overhead line systems](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberleitung) (IFO), which were purchased specifically for use on [high-speed lines](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnellfahrstrecke) . These railcars reach higher speeds than their predecessor, [the 711.0](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.0) , and are used for the maintenance and troubleshooting of overhead line systems, [bridges](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%BCcke) , [tunnels](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel) , and signals. This class gained notoriety due to several fires.

Between 2002 and 2004, [Gleisbaumechanik Brandenburg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleisbaumechanik) manufactured a total of 23 cars. The [pre-production vehicle](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullserie) , numbered 711 101, was not taken over by [DB Netz](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB_Netz) AG because it was too heavy. The current Würzburg railcar later received its number.

# Structure and interior

\[ [Edit](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&veaction=edit&section=2) | [Edit source](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&action=edit&section=2) \]

The [car body](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagenkasten) is divided into three parts. At both ends are the head segments with the [driver's cabs](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BChrerstand) . These are components supplied by [Fahrzeugtechnik Dessau](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrzeugtechnik_Dessau) and correspond in shape to those of the [Modus cars](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus-Wagen) of [DB Regio](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB_Regio) . Between the head segments, the car body is equipped with a workshop, a storage room, a wet room and a social room with a workstation. The workshop contains all the usual spare parts and tools for the maintenance and repair of overhead line systems. The workshop area also contains the wet room with washing facilities and a toilet. The toilet is equipped with a bioreactor, which cleans the wastewater and only releases hot water into the environment - the solid waste container only needs to be emptied at a repair shop for scheduled maintenance.

Next is the video workstation, equipped with a monitor for monitoring the overhead wire position via cameras, a fax machine, and a control panel for panning the camera and roof spotlight. Opposite the video workstation is a small kitchenette with a microwave, kettle, coffee maker, cupboards, a drinking water container, and a sink.

Past the hydraulics for the freely pivoting aerial work platform, you reach the lounge with a radio, seating, a table and drying cabinets for clothes. The second driver's cab is connected to this and separated by a door.

# Roof equipment

\[ [Edit](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&veaction=edit&section=3) | [Edit source](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&action=edit&section=3) \]

[There are two aerial work platforms](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubarbeitsb%C3%BChne) on the roof , one with a free-swinging mechanism (Palfinger PA 360) and one that can only be moved horizontally (Palfinger PA 90). Both can be coupled to increase the usable space. A rope pusher, a [current collector](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromabnehmer) with adjustable [contact pressure](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anpresskraft) , video surveillance and various lighting fixtures have also been installed on the roof. The freely-swinging aerial work platform PA 360 has a work basket with a base area of ​​1500 × 1600 mm and can reach 18.5 m above and around 10 m below [the top of the rails](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schienenoberkante) . The aerial work platform PA 90 has dimensions of 3500 × 1600 mm, reaches 6 m above the top of the rails and can be rotated 90 degrees to either side.

* Aerial work platform extended upwards
*  
* Aerial work platform extended to track height

Both platforms can be secured with a counter-track barrier to prevent them from accidentally turning into the clear space of the siding.

# Drive and brakes

The [railcars](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triebwagen) are equipped with two MAN D 2842 LE 602 [diesel engines](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieselmotor) for mainline service. These engines generate 588 kilowatts (800 hp) at 2100 rpm from a displacement of 21.93 liters; an upgraded version is also used as boat engines.

For work travel, an additional MAN D 0826LOH 19 engine is installed. This one delivers 130 kW (177 hp) from a 6.87-liter displacement. To reduce exhaust emissions for personnel while working in tunnels, it also features a [particulate filter](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieselru%C3%9Fpartikelfilter) .

There's also an onboard power generator that ensures the power supply for the entire electrical system when the diesel engine is switched off. It's fully encapsulated and, thanks to its own battery and 24-volt alternator, virtually independent of the 24-volt vehicle power system, allowing it to be started even when the main batteries are discharged.

All Class 711.1 railcars are fitted with [multi-release disc brakes](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheibenbremse) which act on two brake discs per wheelset and normally operate as [electro-pneumatic brakes . A ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektropneumatische_Bremse)[retarder](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retarder) (flow brake) is also fitted to each gearbox , and there is also a [magnetic track brake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetschienenbremse) for rapid, emergency or forced braking . During normal operation, all braking systems are controlled via the accelerator/brake lever and a brake control unit. This means that the retarders are generally activated first, and the additional pneumatic brake is only applied when their braking force has decreased. For “HL emergency operation” there is also a driver’s brake valve on each driver’s console, although the handle is not normally attached. During emergency operation, only the [compressed air disc brake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druckluftbremse_(Eisenbahn)) is active without EP control.

The railcars have two GPH 200 [bogies . These are largely equivalent to the ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drehgestell)[GP 200 bogies](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drehgestell_Bauart_G%C3%B6rlitz#Bauart_GP200) of passenger coaches, but they have been adapted to the characteristics of a diesel railcar and are additionally equipped with a spring lock. To prevent the bogie from compressing excessively on one side when the work platforms are swung out sideways, thus increasing the risk of tipping, the bogie's primary suspension is deactivated by locking cylinders. When locked, work travel at up to 10 km/h is still possible.

# Electrical equipment

\[ [Edit](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&veaction=edit&section=6) | [Edit source](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&action=edit&section=6) \]

The vehicles are equipped with complex electrical equipment that monitors and executes virtually all vehicle functions via a [programmable logic controller](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speicherprogrammierbare_Steuerung) (PLC). This largely eliminates operating errors and reliably maintains safety-relevant settings. For example, the PLC prevents travel faster than 10 km/h with the spring lock engaged. If a roof-mounted device such as a work platform or rope pusher is not in the transport position, it is not possible to switch to line travel. ""Single-engine operation"" is also possible, with the choice between diesel engine 1 or 2, or the engine with the fewest operating hours is used. The exterior lighting ( [triple headlights](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreilicht-Spitzensignal) and work area lighting) is also controlled by the PLC.

The train must be equipped with a Siemens I 60R [point-to-point train control system](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punktf%C3%B6rmige_Zugbeeinflussung) with software version PZB 90 V2.01 (V1.6 was installed at the factory). There are two time/time [safety control circuits](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicherheitsfahrschaltung) , one software-based for work runs and one hardware-based for line runs. A [GSM-R](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM-R) train radio is also used for communication with connected stations. An [EBuLa](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBuLa) device was also present, which ran on the [Windows 95](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_95) operating system . These EBuLa devices were removed. In January 2014, new EBuLa devices were retrofitted with [Windows XP](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_XP) .

In March 2022, a contract for the installation of [ETCS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System) on-board units (according to [SRS 3.6.0](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System#3.6.0) ) in Class 711.1 railcars was awarded to [Stadler Rail](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadler_Rail) and communicated in January 2023. The contract includes a prototype ( *First of Class* ) and two series conversions.

On February 16, 2012, railcar 711 120 caught fire in [Bienenbüttel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bienenb%C3%BCttel) on the [Lehrte–Hamburg-Harburg railway line](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahnstrecke_Lehrte%E2%80%93Hamburg-Harburg) . The cause was a leak in a hydraulic fan motor, which released an oil aerosol that subsequently ignited. The vehicle was parked and later removed from service. [^(\[ 5 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:1-5)

# Railcar 711 112

\[ [Edit](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&veaction=edit&section=9) | [Edit source](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&action=edit&section=9) \]

The railcar 711 112 caught fire on July 9, 2020 and rolled driverless for approximately 22 kilometers along the [Black Forest Railway](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzwaldbahn_(Baden)) line . [^(\[ 6 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:0-6) The cause of the fire was a leak in the hydraulic system, similar to the above case, which led to the release of a hydraulic oil aerosol. The heat from the turbocharger ignited the mixture underneath the vehicle. The fire initially went unnoticed. As a result of the fire, a neighboring cable duct was damaged and an [emergency brake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwangsbremsung) was triggered between the [Hausach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausach) and [Haslach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haslach_im_Kinzigtal) stations . This also caused a power failure to the control panel. The [driver](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triebfahrzeugf%C3%BChrer) and a train attendant who was also present left the vehicle to investigate. The driver had previously operated the electrically controlled [spring-loaded brake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federspeicherbremse) , but did not notice that it could not be applied due to the power failure. As a result of the fire, a brake hose burst, causing the vehicle to start moving again on the downhill stretch. Attempts by the driver to brake failed due to existing damage to the braking system. Since the vehicle only had a single brake circuit, the entire braking system was ineffective. The driver jumped out at low speed to safety. During the subsequent driverless journey over a distance of more than 21 kilometers, the vehicle set fire to several embankments. [^(\[ 6 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:0-6)

The dispatcher in charge attempted to stop the vehicle at Haslach station by issuing a stop signal and applying the normally associated [PZB emergency brake. Because the braking system was inoperative and the power supply to the PZB computer had failed, the signal had no effect. Two further attempts to stop the vehicle using ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PZB_90)[wheel chocks](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemmschuh) in [Steinach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinach_(Ortenaukreis)) and [Biberach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biberach_(Baden)) also failed. Police vehicles accompanied the wrong-way journey on the adjacent streets and secured several level crossings. Finally, the railcar was brought to a standstill by a deliberate derailment at a [track barrier](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleissperre) in [Gengenbach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gengenbach) , where it was extinguished by the fire service. The vehicle was a total loss. [^(\[ 6 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:0-6)

The incident occurred due to a combination of various technical factors. The [Federal Railway Authority](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenbahn-Bundesamt) therefore ordered several technical modifications to minimize the risk. This included revising the air brake system to prevent a complete loss of braking effect in the event of a single failure. [^(\[ 6 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:0-6)

DB Netz subsequently ordered an inspection of all Class 711.1 vehicles, focusing on the hydraulic systems, and replaced all hydraulic motors as a precautionary measure by the beginning of 2023. [^(\[ 7 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-tonline20240627-7)

On January 20, 2023, there was also an accident involving a Class 711.1 railcar. This time, the railcar 711 119 was involved near [Freilassing . The burning vehicle started moving again after fire-fighting efforts began and rolled, burning, for six kilometers until it was diverted onto a ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freilassing)[dead-end track](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stumpfgleis) shortly before the state border and stopped by a buffer stop. [^(\[ 8 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-8)

So I just took it up and down the block to see how it was going lol OMG holy crap. just down the block and back because I still have to wrap all the wires and make sure all my connections are covered nicely since I did away with the Hal sensor connectors and used spade crimps, ended up using lug crimps on the phase wires there really to thick for much else. And running 50a through those yellow plastic junction boxes makes me nervous as hell, seen a ton of pics of them just a blob of melted plastic maybe with 36v and 48v but definitely not 60+.

Okay the GT08 is no longer a GT08 I sware to God updating from the 37a stock controllers to the YunLi 50a feels like it literally doubled the torque. And the only controller the throttle was okay it didn't have much lag at all like most stock throttles even on other builds when I used a dameo throttle that are decent and it still has a slight delay. I don't know if it's the controller's or the twist throttle but it's like instantaneous power and the twist throttle seems really smooth compared to the trigger. Just got to make sure I turn the key off before I carry it upstairs or something definitely be easier to accidentally hit it. Lol done that before with a different scooter drive up my coffee table and embedded the front tire about 3 feet up the wall in the wall lol needless to say I lost my deposit on that apartment. But I definitely have to say it's a completely different scooter. And with the huge center display it's really bright and colorful, that being on should be enough for me to notice. I definitely have to say that increase in power/torque has got to be at least +70% if not more totally crazy lol. I don't expect much if anything on the speed just how fast it can get there but after I get everything wrapped up and SAFE at least semi I'll update you all on the speed if it's anything like the torque it will be scarry ",1,1748618613.0,ElectricScooters,1,1.0,False
1kz700i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kz700i/i_24m_still_like_my_situationship_girl_but_i_know/,I (24M) still like my situationship girl but I know I shouldn't. How do I respond to these messages she sent me?,"So she was my tarot card reader. We met for the first time on my birthday in 2023, most of our communication was transactional at that time. She had been there for me when I was going through a breakup, and I saw her again randomly in 2024. We started to spend some time at the coffee shop before going to work, we went to a party once which wasn't the best experience for us but it was okay in the end, I was still feeling her out. I wasn't sure about telling her how I felt about her because I always felt like she was the type that didn't want to be held down by a relationship, and this is something she eventually said when she said she doesn't want a label on what we have and would rather me focus on her actions towards me and how that feels. She has been there for me, loved me in a soft, gentle way, and honestly she has often times hinted at us being involved long term, putting forward hypothetical marriage situations, asking me for reassurance of my love for her, having raw intercourse, etc. I got my new apartment early April. Prior to moving in, she had offered to help with the cleaning. I was excited for this because I viewed it as a bonding activity. She canceled a few days prior to my move in date, saying she felt overwhelmed and drained. I was disappointed, and I made the situation worse by expressing that and she responded by breaking up with me at 2:17 shortly afterwards, masking her reasons behind needing time to focus on school, etc. I went to see her at 2 in the morning and we spoke for hours. It was a very emotional moment for me, it hurt. After this she had offered to be exclusive fwb, and I accepted. So for the last two months or so thats what we were, and it was good enough for me. We had a few conflicts though. Most recently I found out she was spending time with a throuple she was previously involved with, and she kept it a secret from me. She said that she felt bad about this and she went home. Two nights ago she was in town for her friends birthday and she said she wanted to see me. It was midnight and I missed her so I agreed. I was irresponsible however, because i knew i didnt have enough gas, but I still thought I could make it. I ran out of gas nearby, was stranded for hours, ended up having to tow the vehicle to a garage, so now im without a car (it wasnt my vehicle). She was irritated by this, understandbly so. In the AMs after I got home from all that, her and I were speaking about how she felt about me, based on some questions I had asked her recently and me expressing that I didnt feel important in her life, I thought the conversation was going well until she said it felt like we're going in circles and that we're just not right for each other. She then asks if I think we would have been better off as friends. She was always saying she doesnt think she would be a good girlfriend to me. I told her that she was able to choose if she was a good or bad one because her actions are fully in her control. During the phone call she said ""you do know one day I'll have to end this right"" and I asked her, ""do you not see me in any of your pictures for the long term?"" to which she said no. I asked her why, she proceeded to tell me that she sees herself with a specific type of partner. I asked her what type and she was hesitant to tell me at first because she was saying that i just want to rectify the issue, but I told her I was done trying and I just wanted to know. So she said she wanted someone more spiritual, someone established and who could take care of her if she was to pop up pregnant, things like that. I told her I didnt feel like she took time to peel back the layers of my consciousness or get to know me in that way. I often felt at times as though she viewed me as being less emotionally intelligent or whatever because she's in her first year of studying psychology. She also said on the call that she still wanted to see me to hug me one more time and give me whatever she has for me and that she still loves me and its not like shes just flipped a switch and moved on etc. Since that phone call she has sent me two messages, ""Hey... I hope you're okay. I'm sorry you feel sick right now. I'm unsure when I'll be able to come back into town at the moment, but I'll let you know when I can. Is it okay if I check on you occasionally? Or would you like some space for a while"" I just don't see why she's posing these questions to me. Based on the decision she made, there will automatically be space between us. And I am not her type or someone she sees long term, so why would she want to occasionally check in? I dont want her to do anything more for me out of guilt, or pity. I just don't know how to respond. It's been one day. How I feel is, I still care about and love her but it seems finished. I'm tired of the one foot in, one foot out, confusing type of dynamic, but I'm always open to her because I really do like her and I enjoy her.

1kz6zuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kz6zuk/the_secretary/,The secretary.,"I wasn’t always this kind of person.

My name is Claire. I used to work for a law firm—paralegal, quiet cubicle, black coffee every morning. Then I answered an ad that read:

“Seeking Executive Assistant. Confidential employer. High pay. Must be discreet.”

Turns out, discretion is more than not gossiping about your boss's affairs. Sometimes, it means keeping your mouth shut while he saws through someone’s spinal column in the next room.

His name is Mr. Granger. That’s not his real name, I don’t think. He never told me, and I never asked. What I do know is he dresses like a professor—brown tweed, round glasses, smells faintly of old books and formaldehyde. He never yells. Never rushes. Every word is precise, measured.

He kills people for art.

""Not everyone can appreciate the beauty in decay,” he once told me, while polishing a ribcage.

I was going to quit. The first week, when he calmly explained the ""side responsibilities"" of my job—inventorying bones, logging teeth, laundering blood-soaked clothes—I nearly threw up on his leather couch. But he offered me $10,000 a week. Cash. No taxes. And somewhere in the back of my skull, in a place I didn’t want to look too hard at, something whispered:

Stay. Watch. Learn.

There are rules.

I don't ask where he gets them.

I don’t help with the “procurement.”

But I catalog every inch of the aftermath.

Tonight, though… tonight was different.

He brought a girl in. Young. Maybe twenty-two. Bruised, shivering, duct tape hanging off her mouth. Her eyes locked with mine as he dragged her into the studio—his name for the concrete room behind the bookshelf.

Something in her stare sliced deeper than any scalpel he’s ever used.

I didn’t look away.

Three hours later, the door creaked open. The smell hit first—burnt hair, copper, feces, and meat. He emerged in a plastic apron, glistening with crimson. His hands were shaking.

“Claire,” he said quietly, “something went wrong.”

He never says that.

“There was… resistance. She scratched me.”

I noticed the four bleeding lines down his cheek. He looked at me like a child who’d lost his favorite toy. “I made a mess.”

He needed me to clean. To fix. To hide the failure. I nodded, grabbed the gloves, the bleach, the hacksaw.

The girl was still alive.

Barely.

Her lower half was pulp. Her arms dislocated. A tube was jammed in her throat to keep her quiet. She looked at me, pleading, knowing. She knew I could end it. She was begging for it.

I hesitated.

Then I pulled the plastic over her face.

I held it tight. Her legs twitched. Her lips turned blue. It took longer than I thought it would. Long enough to remember her name—Katie—it was on her student ID in the pile of clothes I folded earlier.

I didn’t cry. I didn’t scream. I just went back to work.

I told myself I was being kind.

But that night, something cracked in me.

Something old and silent stood up and stretched.


---

It’s been four months since then.

I don’t flinch at blood anymore. I can tell you how to remove a jawbone in under thirty minutes. I know how long it takes to dissolve a femur in industrial acid. I keep notes.

Mr. Granger is… proud of me.

He’s started letting me pick them.

“You have a good eye,” he said after I chose the married couple from out of town. “She wept perfectly. Like a symphony.”

I laughed. Actually laughed.

He smiles at me now. More often. Longer.

Tonight, though… I have a surprise for him.

He's sitting in his reading chair when I bring in the tea. Jasmine. His favorite.

He takes the first sip, hums approvingly.

Then his eyes go wide.

The cup shatters.

He collapses, twitching.

Oleander. Just enough to paralyze.

He’s awake when I strip him. When I drag him to the table. When I strap him down, limb by limb.

I whisper in his ear: “It’s my turn now.”

He tries to speak, but his tongue won’t move. Just a wet, gargled protest.

The scalpel feels good in my hand.

Familiar.

Comforting.

I start with his left eye.

He watches the blade come. Can’t close the lid in time. I cut slow. It pops like a grape.

I log every scream, every shiver, every puddle of blood.

I make art.

For hours.

When he finally dies, I don’t even realize it. I'm too busy perfecting the incision along his collarbone.

He taught me everything.

But he never taught me how to stop.


---

I kept the house. Burned the studio. Took his bones and built something new.

Now I work alone.

But the work never stops.

There’s always someone who deserves it. Always a canvas.

And I have a very steady hand.

1kz6w5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutInCoffee/comments/1kz6w5z/tips_for_using_outin_at_high_altitudes/,Tips for using OutIn at high altitudes,"Brewing coffee at high altitudes changes the game. The air pressure is lower, water boils at a lower temperature, and your usual brewing habits might not get you the same rich flavor you love.

If you're planning to take your OutIn Nano on a mountain trip, here are some quick tips to get the perfect brew:

\- Preheat the device and your cup: Keeping everything warm helps counteract the faster heat loss in colder, thinner air. It can make a big difference in extraction quality.

\- Use hotter water if possible: At higher elevations, water boils below 100°C (212°F). If you can heat your water just a little longer before brewing, it can help mimic sea-level brewing temps.

\- Grind slightly finer: Because water boils at a lower temperature, extraction can be weaker. A finer grind can help ensure you’re still getting a rich, full-bodied cup.

\- Charge your device fully before the trip: Cold temperatures can sap battery life faster. Starting with a full charge ensures you won't be caught halfway through your brew.

\- Insulate your water source: Keep your water inside an insulated bottle or thermos until brewing. Cold water can lead to under-extraction or longer brew times.

\- Allow a little extra brew time: Be patient! Giving the OutIn Nano an extra 15–30 seconds can sometimes help pull a better espresso when brewing in colder, thinner air.

1kz6ugm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1kz6ugm/women_constipation_before_your_monthly/,Women: Constipation before your monthly,"


Hi all! I am 27F with IBS-M. I try to abide by a low FODMAP diet (hard to do when I travel for work half of the year), am allergic to dairy (no bueno), and I take Linzess a few times a week (cannot take every day). I do menstruate and recently concluded that I get very constipated right before my period. For most women, that seems to be normal. For IBS, as you all know, that can be torturous. This week, I went this Monday evening - Friday early morning (today) without a BM. I even took Linzess two times this week and nothing! I tried to eat normally (for me), drink enough water, drink my normal amount of coffee (which doesn't bother me), walk around a fair bit, and nothing. I am on the birth control pill for other medical reasons and am uncertain if that plays a role, but I am thinking it's just the period hormones fluctuating and changing a routine. Do other women get this? Does anyone have any solutions or things that have worked for anyone in the past? If Linzess isn't working for me, I feel like a lost cause! 

Side note: What is also crazy is my stomach stayed flat the ENTIRE WEEK. How? I have no idea! Usually I'd be distended to 11 months pregnant 😂

1kz6r7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1kz6r7e/why_choose_seventh_generation_laundry_detergent/,Why Choose Seventh Generation Laundry Detergent Packs Free Clear Review for Sensitive Skin?,"The Seventh Generation 20732913229776 Laundry Detergent Packs, Free & Clear, have made quite an impression on me in recent weeks. I've been using this product daily, and while there’s plenty to like about it, a few aspects deserve a closer look. As someone who deals regularly with laundry (who doesn’t, really?), I’ve had the opportunity to test its features under a range of different conditions. With its plant-based formula and eco-friendly credentials, this product promises much—and largely delivers.

**Design and Packaging**  
I admit, the compact design of the detergent packs makes the whole laundry process far simpler. Each pack is neatly sealed in a dissolvable PVA film, which means all you need to do is toss it into the washing machine without having to measure messy liquids or powders. The resealable bag not only keeps the packs fresh but also helps prevent accidental spills, a detail I could appreciate after a disastrous encounter with a leaky bottle of detergent last year. These little pods are lightweight and don’t take up much space, which is great for someone like me, with limited storage in my laundry area.

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  
Whether it's grass-stained jeans my kid drags in from soccer practice or my unfortunate coffee spills on work shirts, these packs have been surprisingly effective. The quadruple-enzyme formula really seems to tackle tough stains with ease. From ketchup to chocolate, the detergent has removed various stubborn marks without too much extra effort on my part. What I particularly liked is its anti-graying effect, which keeps whites looking crispier. Not to overhype it, but there’s satisfaction in seeing a fresh set of bright whites out of the wash.

[Check Seventh Generation 20732913229776 price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b01g351tpa/)  

**Gentle on Sensitive Skin**  
Skin irritations have been a recurring issue in my household, so fragrance-free and dye-free products are non-negotiable. The hypoallergenic formulation means everyone can comfortably wear their freshly cleaned clothes without worrying about itchiness or reactions. Even my toddler, who has the most sensitive skin of us all, hasn’t had any problems after switching to this detergent. Knowing the dermatologist-tested formula leaves out artificial brighteners is also a relief, given how carefully I need to curate the products I bring into my home.

**Environmental Friendliness**  
Sustainability is a buzzword that gets thrown around a lot, but this product backs it up with a solid eco-friendly core. Certified as a USDA Biobased Product, it boasts a 94% plant-based ingredient list. The EPA Safer Choice seal is also pretty reassuring, making it clear that Seventh Generation puts some effort into ensuring safety and sustainability. As someone trying to reduce her environmental footprint, using a detergent that aligns with these values feels like a small but meaningful step in the right direction.

**Positives**  
Here are the highlights that stood out during my testing:  
- Hypoallergenic and free from fragrances, dyes, and artificial brighteners, perfect for sensitive skin.  
- The powerful quadruple-enzyme formula handles tough stains without requiring repeated washes.  
- Compact, easy-to-use packs make laundry simpler and measurements unnecessary.  

**Caveats**  
That’s not to say everything’s perfect. There are some weak points worth mentioning:  
- The packs are slightly more expensive compared to traditional liquid or powder detergents, so they fall into the “premium” category.  
- Some reviews I came across noted occasional issues with packs not dissolving completely in the wash, leaving behind small residues, though I didn’t personally experience this.  
- The lack of a scented option might disappoint people who prefer their laundry to come out smelling floral or fresh.  

**Competing Brands**  
While this detergent has been a great experience, comparing it with other market staples provides a clearer picture. Products like Tide Pods offer similar user-friendly packs and impressive stain removal but at the expense of harsher chemicals that sensitive households might want to avoid. On the other hand, Mrs. Meyer’s Clean Day detergent has excellent eco-friendly credentials and lovely scents, yet its stain-removing power can underwhelm at times. In contrast, the Seventh Generation offers a good blend of effective cleaning and low hypoallergenic impact, though some might see its lack of fragrance as a downside.

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering the overall performance and safety features, the price point feels justified for what the detergent offers. While not the cheapest, I’d argue its hypoallergenic qualities and environmental benefits add value for anyone willing to spend a little extra on sustainable and sensitive-skin-friendly products. Plus, the convenience of having pre-measured laundry packs can’t be underestimated—it saves both time and hassle during hectic laundry days.

Was shopping the other day with my husband and tried on a white polo - the fit was comfortable and generally i liked it. My husband said I should definitely get it - i was hesitant because - white. But he was insistent and since he liked it so much on me I got it.

Wore it out the first day today. Guess what happened? Got myself a cup of coffee - wasn't even drinking it yet or driving in the car - literally was just opening the topper to get a sip and coffee just splashed on me. I'm big mad.

FML - NEVER buy solid whites.

Just an additional note - yes I have wipes/stick - still doesn't make the situation less annoying because now I have to rub a wet wipe all over my chest like a dumbass.",44,1748617970.0,rant,25,0.94,False

Turn 5 or 6, he plays [[Warped World]], I shuffle in 10 permanents and get back 3 lands, [[Marneus Calgar]], [[Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines]], [[Smothering Tithe]], and [[Jace, Wielder of Mysteries]] (rest of instants and sorceries go to bottom of library).

Friend A gets [[Forced Fruition]] from the Warped World.

Friend B starts their turn by destroying my Elesh Norn. On cast he draws 7, pays nothing, so I make 7 treasures, and draw 7 cards from Marneus (because each draw individually triggers Smothering Tithe, and each seperate event making a treasure triggers the draw).
B continues to cast spells trying to find an answer, never paying for the Tithe. I keep drawing instants and countering his removal or removing his combo pieces.

Passes to C. In upkeep I play an instant, counter my own instant, and cast one more spell to forced fruition draw myself to a win.

That was my first game winning by drawing out.


Anyone have a similar story with a mega-chaos card like Warped World or [[Scrambleverse]]?



TL;DR: Chaos shenanigans give me a perfect board state to sneak a win before my next turn, aided by someone hoping to draw answers from the heart of the cards and giving me the tools to stop them by doing so.

Tell me your favorite chaos story, win or loss.


Edit: It was a late night and none of us saw that planeswalkers don't get put on the field, but B also got Elspeth out, so we were at least consistent with the mistake. (Only realizing the mistake now as I read Warp World with coffee in my system.)",1,1748617770.0,mtg,1,0.67,False

You allowed to want to be happy with someone you pick and sometimes feelings change or someone you vibe with comes along better.

However, I feel like a lot of people are extremely picking in online dating, to a degree anything they do not like at all can lead to automatic ghosting or unmatching. I was talking to this girl and the vibe was really good for 3 days and then because I told her I was not a fan of coffee, I joke you not, she ghosted me. 

Some people start ghosting as soon as someone else comes along or sometimes quietly unmatch. 

A new list of ""Icks"" are created where ANYTHING can be seen as undesirable. Like and not limited too: singing, wearing certain clothes and being nice!

The grass is always greener mentality has kind of made people almost impossibly picky. Ghosting is the answer to everything and no one is happy as people are waiting for the next ""Match"" to be better than the person they are talking to.

What would you do if you had to rebuild with no followers, no savings, and no niche?

It's something that speaks to the soul, isn't it? That itch to explore, to see new places, to immerse ourselves in different cultures. We dream of wandering through ancient ruins, sipping coffee in sun-drenched piazzas, or hiking through breathtaking landscapes. But then reality often swoops in, like a particularly grumpy albatross, and reminds us of that pesky little detail: the cost. Flights, bless their metal wings, can often be the biggest hurdle between us and our wanderlust. It feels like tickets are priced on a whim, a cosmic lottery that we rarely seem to win. One day, a trip to Paris looks totally doable, and the next, it’s suddenly priced like a one-way ticket to the moon. It’s enough to make you want to throw your passport in the air and give up on the whole travel dream. But what if there was a way to outsmart the system, to catch those fleeting opportunities, to snag those dream flights without having to sell a kidney? That's where our little secret weapon comes in, a digital guardian angel whispering sweet nothings about low prices: **Cheap Airfare Alerts**.

The Holy Grail for Globetrotters: How Cheap Airfare Alerts Can Be Your Secret Weapon Against Sky-High Prices
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's be honest, searching for flights can feel like a full-time job. You spend hours scrolling through websites, trying every combination of dates and times, refreshing the page with the fervor of a gambler at a slot machine, only to be met with disappointment after disappointment. It’s exhausting, frustrating, and frankly, a buzzkill for your travel excitement. You see your desired destinations just out of reach, taunting you with their exorbitant price tags. Who has that kind of time or patience? Certainly not me, and I'm willing to bet you don't either. We've got lives to live, after all! This is where the magic of **cheap airfare alerts** steps in, like a knight in shining digital armor, ready to slay the dragon of expensive flights. These alerts are basically your personal price trackers, keeping an eagle eye on the fluctuations of flight costs so you don't have to. Think of them as your tireless travel agent, working 24/7 to find you the best possible deals. They are the unsung heroes of budget travel, quietly working in the background to make your travel dreams a reality.

### What Exactly Are Cheap Airfare Alerts and Why Should You Care?

At its core, a cheap airfare alert is a notification you receive when the price of a flight you're interested in drops. It's that simple, and yet, it's utterly brilliant. These alerts can come in various forms – emails, push notifications on your phone, or even SMS messages, depending on the service you use. The beauty of it lies in its passive nature. You set your parameters – your desired departure and arrival cities, perhaps a range of dates, and maybe even a target price you’re hoping to stay under – and then you let the technology do the heavy lifting. No more endless scavenging through airline websites or constantly checking comparison sites. The alert acts as a digital ""tap on the shoulder,"" letting you know when a price dip has occurred that matches your criteria. And why should you care? Because those price dips aren't always obvious on your casual searches. Airlines use complex algorithms to determine pricing, and those prices can change drastically within hours, even minutes. A flight that was unaffordable yesterday might be a steal today. Without alerts, you're relying purely on luck and the sheer amount of time you're willing to invest in searching. With alerts, you're giving yourself a significant advantage, essentially putting yourself in the express lane to discovering those hidden gems and fantastic deals. It's like having a crystal ball that gives you a heads-up on impending sales!

Imagine this: you're sitting at your desk, minding your own business, probably daydreaming about that beach in Thailand, when *ding!* An alert pops up. It tells you the flight to Bangkok you've been eyeing has dropped 30%! Suddenly, that far-off dream is within reach. That’s the power of these alerts. They transform passive dreaming into actionable opportunities.

### How Do These Magical Alerts Actually Work? A Peep Behind the Curtain

So, the big question is, how do these things actually *work*? It's not pure magic, though it can feel like it sometimes. The process is rooted in data and sophisticated monitoring. Travel websites, search engines, and dedicated flight alert services employ programs that are constantly scanning massive amounts of data from airlines and ticket aggregators. They're tracking the prices of millions of flight routes, for countless dates and times. When you set up an alert, you're essentially giving these programs specific instructions on what to look for. They then add your desired parameters to their monitoring list. When the price of a flight matching your criteria changes, particularly if it drops significantly or reaches a certain threshold you’ve set, the system triggers a notification to you.

Think of it like a stock ticker for flights. Just as stock prices fluctuate based on market conditions, flight prices change based on a multitude of factors, including:

- **Demand:** Are people booking heavily for that route and date? Higher demand usually means higher prices.
- **Seasonality:** Prices tend to be higher during peak travel seasons (holidays, summer) and lower during off-peak times.
- **Fuel Costs:** Fluctuating fuel prices can impact airline operational costs, which can be reflected in ticket prices.
- **Competition:** The presence of multiple airlines on a route can often lead to competitive pricing.
- **Airline Sales and Promotions:** Airlines frequently run flash sales or promotional deals to stimulate bookings.
- **Time Until Departure:** Prices often change as the departure date approaches. Sometimes they go up, sometimes they drop if the airline needs to fill seats.

The alert systems are designed to pick up on these changes and alert you when a favorable movement occurs. They are, in essence, extremely efficient digital detectives, constantly on the case to find you a bargain. They're not just waiting for a general price drop; they're looking specifically for the drops that matter to *you*, based on your preferences. It's this personalized aspect that makes them so effective.

Setting Sail Towards Savings: Choosing the Right Platform for Your Cheap Airfare Alerts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, so we're sold on the concept of **cheap airfare alerts**. They sound pretty darn useful, right? But now comes the next logical question: where do you find these magical alert services? The good news is, you've got options, and quite a few of them. The digital travel landscape is teeming with platforms that offer this feature. The not-so-bad news is, you have to choose which one(s) are the best fit for you. Not all platforms are created equal, and their alert systems can vary in their features, reliability, and ease of use. Some might be fantastic for international flights, while others might excel at finding deals on domestic routes. Some offer more customization options for your alerts, allowing you to be very specific about your desired price range, while others are more general. It's a bit like picking out the perfect travel companion – you need to find one that suits your style and needs.

### Navigating the Digital Seas: Popular Platforms Offering Airfare Alerts

When it comes to finding platforms that offer airfare alerts, you're spoiled for choice. Here are some of the heavy hitters in the travel search and booking world that provide this invaluable service:

- **Google Flights:** This is often the first stop for many travelers, and for good reason. Google Flights is incredibly powerful in its search capabilities, and its price tracking feature is top-notch. You can easily track specific flights, routes, or even just a general destination for a range of dates. It's simple, intuitive, and widely used. Plus, being a Google product, it integrates well with other Google services.
- **Skyscanner:** Another popular global flight comparison site, Skyscanner also offers price alerts. They're known for their ""Everywhere"" search feature, which is great for finding cheap destinations if you're flexible. Setting up alerts is straightforward and they send out email notifications when prices change.
- **Hopper:** This platform takes a slightly different approach. Hopper uses historical data to predict whether flight prices are likely to go up or down, giving you recommendations on whether to book now or wait. Their app is particularly user-friendly and focuses heavily on mobile alerts. They even let you ""watch"" specific trips and will notify you of price changes and predictive advice.
- **Kayak:** A long-standing player in the travel search space, Kayak also offers price alerts, which they call ""Price Alerts."" You can track specific itineraries and receive email or push notifications. They're a reliable option with a wide range of flight options.
- **Momondo:** Similar to Skyscanner and Kayak, Momondo is another robust comparison site that provides price alerts. They have a slightly different interface and might sometimes surface different deals than other platforms. Setting up alerts is a breeze.
- **Experienced-Based Deal Sites (e.g., Scott's Cheap Flights, The Flight Deal):** While not traditional search engines, these services curate and share incredible deals they find. You sign up for their newsletters or premium services and they send you curated alerts for often incredibly low fares (sometimes mistake fares!). This is a more passive approach, but can yield truly exceptional savings.

Each of these platforms has its own strengths and weaknesses. It's worth exploring a couple of them to see which interface you prefer and which seems to consistently find the best deals for the routes you're interested in. Don't be afraid to try more than one! Having alerts set up on multiple platforms for the same route can increase your chances of catching that sweet spot in pricing.

### Customization is King: Tailoring Your Alerts for Maximum Impact

Simply setting up an alert for ""flights to Rome"" isn't going to be as effective as tailoring your alerts to your specific needs and preferences. The more details you provide, the more relevant and valuable the alerts will be. Think of it as giving your digital travel agent a detailed brief instead of just saying ""find me a trip.""

Here are some ways to customize your **cheap airfare alerts** for maximum impact:

1. **Specify Your Dates (or Range):** Are you flexible with your travel dates, or do you need to travel on specific days? Most platforms allow you to set up alerts for precise dates or for a range of dates (e.g., anytime in September). The more flexible you are, the more likely you are to find a great deal.
2. **Select Your Departure Airport(s):** Are you tied to one specific departure airport, or are you willing to travel from a nearby city? Including alternative departure airports in your search can sometimes uncover significantly cheaper fares.
3. **Choose Your Destination(s):** Obviously, you'll need a destination. But consider setting up alerts for nearby airports as well. Flying into a smaller airport near your desired destination can sometimes be cheaper than flying directly into the main hub.
4. **Set a Target Price:** Some platforms allow you to set a specific price point you're hoping to stay under. While this isn't always necessary (simply getting notified of significant drops is often enough), it can be helpful if you have a strict budget.
5. **Specify Airline Alliances or Preferred Airlines:** If you have airline loyalty or prefer flying with a particular alliance, some platforms allow you to filter your results or set up alerts specifically for those carriers.
6. **Consider One-Way vs. Round Trip:** Sometimes booking two one-way tickets can be cheaper than a round trip, especially on international routes or with different airlines. Explore setting up alerts for both options.

The key here is to be as precise as possible while still allowing for a bit of flexibility where you can. This balancing act will help the alert system filter out irrelevant information and focus on finding the deals that truly matter to your travel plans.

The Thrill of the Chase: What to Do When You Receive a Cheap Airfare Alert
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

You've done it! You've set up your alerts, you're patiently (or perhaps not so patiently) waiting, and suddenly, that glorious notification arrives. It's a cheap airfare alert! Your heart might skip a beat, a little jolt of excitement running through you. This is the culmination of your proactive approach to finding affordable flights. But receiving the alert is just the first step. What you do *next* is crucial in actually snagging that deal before it disappears into the ether. Remember, these low prices can be fleeting, like a shooting star – you need to act fast to catch them.

### Act Fast, But Don't Panic: Evaluating and Booking Your Alerted Fare

Receiving an alert is exciting, but it's important to approach the next steps with a cool head. Don't just blindly click ""book"" the moment you see the notification. Take a moment to evaluate the offer and make sure it truly meets your needs.

Here’s a breakdown of what to do when you get that coveted alert:

1. **Verify the Price and Dates:** Double-check that the price you're seeing matches the alert and that the dates work for your travel plans. Sometimes, clicking through from the alert might show slightly different pricing depending on real-time availability.
2. **Check the Airline and Route:** Which airline is the flight with? Does the route involve inconvenient layovers or particularly long travel times? Is it a reputable airline you're comfortable flying with? These are important factors to consider.
3. **Review the Fare Class and Inclusions:** What are the terms of the fare? Is it a basic economy fare with restrictions on checked baggage or seat selection? Does it include things like meals or in-flight entertainment? Understand what you're getting for the price.
4. **Consider Baggage Fees:** That incredibly cheap ticket might be a steal, but are you going to get hit with exorbitant baggage fees? Check the airline's baggage policy, especially for checked bags and significant carry-on sizes. This can sometimes add a surprising amount to the total cost.
5. **Look at the Layover Situation:** If there's a layover, how long is it? Is it at an airport you're comfortable transiting through? Too short a layover can be stressful, while an unnecessarily long one can eat into your travel time.
6. **Read the Fine Print:** This is crucial! Understand the cancellation policy, change fees, and any other restrictions associated with the fare. Cheaper fares often come with less flexibility.
7. **Compare with Other Options (Quickly):** Even though you received an alert, it's a good idea to do a very quick search on one or two other platforms to see if that alerted price is truly the best deal available at that exact moment. Prices can fluctuate rapidly, and another site might have a slightly different offer.
8. **Assess the Urgency:** Some alerts are for flash sales that disappear quickly (like within hours), while others might indicate a more sustained price drop. The alert itself or the platform's information might give you a clue about the urgency. If it's a truly exceptional, possibly even a ""mistake"" fare, you'll need to move *very* fast.
9. **Have Your Payment Information Ready:** If you've evaluated the fare and it looks good, don't waste time fumbling for your credit card information. Have it ready to complete the booking process quickly.

The goal is to act decisively but thoughtfully. That incredible deal won't last forever, but you also don't want to book a flight that ends up being inconvenient or more expensive than you thought once all the fees are factored in.

### Don't Let the Deal Slip Away: Tips for Securing Low Fares

So, you've received the alert, you've evaluated the fare, and it's screaming ""book me!"" Now what? Here are some tips to help you secure that low fare before someone else does:

- **Be Prepared:** Have your travel companion's information (passport details if traveling internationally) readily available. You'll often need this to complete the booking.
- **Use a Fast and Reliable Internet Connection:** This might sound obvious, but a slow connection can be the difference between snagging the deal and missing out.
- **Clear Your Cookies and Cache:** Sometimes, websites can show you higher prices if they ""remember"" your previous searches for that route. Clearing your browser's cookies and cache *before* clicking through from the alert can sometimes help.
- **Consider Booking Directly with the Airline:** While booking through a third-party site might seem convenient, sometimes booking directly with the airline can be beneficial in case of flight changes or cancellations. Plus, some airlines offer price matching. Weigh the pros and cons.
- **Be Flexible (If You Can):** If the alerted fare is for dates just a day or two before or after your original preference, and that flexibility works for you, consider shifting your dates slightly. Sometimes even a small adjustment can result in significant savings.
- **Set Up Multiple Alerts:** As mentioned earlier, having alerts on different platforms can increase your chances.
- **Don't Overthink It (Within Reason):** If the price is good and the flight details work for you, don't spend hours agonizing over whether it could *maybe* get even lower. A good deal now is better than no deal later.

It's a bit of a game of speed and strategy. Receiving the alert is like being dealt a winning hand, but you have to play your cards right to collect the prize.

Beyond the Alert: Additional Strategies for Snagging Cheap Airfare (Because Alerts Aren't the Only Trick Up Your Sleeve)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While **cheap airfare alerts** are undeniably powerful tools, they aren't the *only* way to find affordable flights. Think of them as your primary weapon, but you should also have a few other tricks up your sleeve. The savvy budget traveler knows that a multi-pronged approach is the best way to consistently find good deals. Combining the power of alerts with other smart booking strategies can significantly increase your chances of landing those dream trips without breaking the bank. It's like being a master chef with a full pantry of ingredients, capable of creating a delicious meal using various techniques.

### Timing is Everything: When to Book and Fly for the Best Deals

We’ve touched on this a bit, but the timing of your booking and your travel dates plays a colossal role in flight pricing. It’s not just about *if* you get an alert, but also *when* you book in relation to your departure date and *when* you actually plan to travel.

Here are some insights into timing your flight bookings and travel for maximum savings:

- **The ""Sweet Spot"" for Booking:** While debated, the general consensus is there's a booking window that *often* yields the best prices for domestic flights – typically between 1 to 3 months before departure. For international flights, it might be a bit earlier, perhaps 2 to 6 months out. Booking too early (more than 6 months) can mean you miss out on future sales, while booking too late (within a few weeks of departure) can see prices skyrocket as seats fill up. However, receiving an alert *outside* this window for an exceptionally low fare is when you jump on it!
- **Avoid Peak Travel Times:** This is a no-brainer, but worth reiterating. Flying during major holidays, school breaks, and the height of tourist season in popular destinations will almost always cost you more. If your schedule allows, aim for shoulder seasons (the periods just before and after peak season) or the off-season. You’ll often find lower prices *and* fewer crowds.
- **Flying on Tuesdays and Wednesdays:** Historically, Tuesday and Wednesday flights have been considered the cheapest days to fly. While not a hard-and-fast rule anymore, these days *can* still offer lower fares than flying on Fridays or Sundays, which are typically the most expensive travel days.
- **Consider Red-Eye Flights or Early Morning/Late Night Departures:** Undesirable flight times often come with lower price tags simply because they're less convenient. If you don't mind a very early start or a late arrival, you can often save money.
- **Be Aware of Local Events and Festivals:** If you're traveling to a destination during a major festival, concert, or sporting event, expect higher prices due to increased demand.

Think of it like catching a wave. You need to be in the right place at the right time to ride it effectively. With flights, being aware of these timing factors can help you position yourself to catch those favorable price movements.

### Flex Your Flexibility: How Being Open to Change Can Save You Big Bucks

This ties in closely with timing, but deserves its own spotlight. The more flexible you can be with your travel plans, the more likely you are to find incredibly low fares. Airlines often use flexibility as a lever to offer lower prices. If you're rigidly tied to specific dates, times, and airports, you limit the opportunities for saving.

Here's how flexing your flexibility can lead to significant savings and how **cheap airfare alerts** can help you capitalize on it:

- **Flexible Dates:** As mentioned, traveling during the shoulder or off-season can be much cheaper. If your work or personal schedule allows for a range of dates, use the flexible date search options on flight comparison sites. Also, set up alerts for different date ranges around your preferred travel window. An alert might pop up for dates a week earlier or later that are significantly cheaper.
- **Flexible Airports:** Willing to fly into a smaller airport near your final destination or from a larger airport within a reasonable driving distance? This can dramatically open up your options for finding cheaper fares. Set up alerts for multiple airports near your origin and destination.
- **Flexible Destinations:** This is where truly incredible deals can be found, especially through curated deal sites. If you simply have a desire to travel somewhere, *anywhere*, and you're open to suggestions, you can stumble upon astonishingly low fares. Services like Google Flights' ""Explore"" feature or Skyscanner's ""Everywhere"" search, combined with alerts based on general regions, can point you towards unexpectedly affordable destinations.
- **Flexible Stopovers:** Non-stop flights are convenient, but flights with one or more layovers are often cheaper. If you don't mind a stop, you can save money. Consider alerts for routes with layovers, as these can sometimes see even more volatile price drops.

Embracing flexibility is like having a secret key that unlocks hidden doors to incredible travel deals. It requires a shift in mindset, moving from ""I *must* go to X on Y date"" to ""I want to go *somewhere* amazing, and I'm open to *when* and *how*.""

### Beyond the Ticket Price: Accounting for Hidden Costs and Maximizing Value

It’s easy to get fixated on the headline price of the flight ticket, but a smart traveler knows that the true cost of airfare can be higher once you factor in all the potential add-ons and fees. A seemingly cheap fare can quickly become not-so-cheap if you’re not careful.

Here’s what to consider beyond the initial ticket price:

- **Baggage Fees:** As mentioned earlier, these can add up fast. If you plan on checking a bag, factor in the cost when comparing fares. Some budget airlines have very strict carry-on size and weight limits as well, so be mindful of those.
- **Seat Selection Fees:** Many airlines now charge extra if you want to choose your seat in advance. If you have a strong preference for window or aisle, or need to sit with travel companions, this is an additional cost.
- **In-Flight Amenities:** Does the fare include things like meals, snacks, drinks, or entertainment? If not, and these are important to you, you might end up spending money on board.
- **Travel Insurance:** While an additional cost, travel insurance can be invaluable if something goes wrong – flight cancellations, delays, lost luggage, or medical emergencies. Consider factoring this into your overall travel budget.
- **Transportation to and from the Airport:** How much will it cost to get to your departure airport and from your arrival airport to your final destination? Sometimes, flying into a slightly more expensive airport closer to where you need to be can be cheaper than flying into a cheaper airport that requires a long and expensive taxi or train ride.
- **Time Costs:** While not a monetary cost, consider the value of your time. A flight with multiple long layovers might be cheaper, but is the extra travel time worth the savings?

Maximizing value isn't always synonymous with finding the absolute lowest ticket price. It's about finding the combination of price, convenience, and included services that best suits your needs and budget. Use your **cheap airfare alerts** as a starting point, but then do your due diligence to understand the full cost and value of the fare.

The Future of Flight Finding: Emerging Trends and What's Next for Cheap Airfare Alerts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The world of travel and technology is constantly evolving, and the way we find and book flights is no exception. Just as we’ve seen the rise of online travel agencies and flight comparison sites, we're likely to see new innovations in how we discover and secure affordable airfare. What worked yesterday might not be the most effective strategy tomorrow. Staying informed about these emerging trends can help us remain ahead of the curve and continue being savvy budget travelers. It's a dynamic landscape, and being adaptable is key!

### AI, Machine Learning, and Predictive Pricing: The Tech Behind the Deals

The magic behind many of the effective **cheap airfare alerts** today is increasingly powered by sophisticated technology like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). These technologies are constantly analyzing vast datasets of historical flight prices, booking patterns, economic indicators, and even weather forecasts to predict how prices are likely to change.

Here’s how AI and ML are influencing the world of airfare and alerts:

- **More Accurate Price Predictions:** Platforms like Hopper are already using predictive analytics, but expect this to become even more sophisticated. AI can identify subtle patterns in pricing that are invisible to the human eye, leading to more accurate ""buy now"" or ""wait"" recommendations.
- **Personalized Alerts:** Future alert systems might not just tell you when a price drops, but when a price drop that is *specifically* relevant to your booking history and travel preferences occurs. Imagine getting an alert not just for a price drop to Paris, but an alert for a price drop on the specific type of fare or cabin class you've booked in the past.
- **Dynamic Pricing Alerts:** Some airlines and travel companies are already using dynamic pricing, where prices change in real-time based on demand and other factors. AI and ML will likely make this even more granular. Alert systems will need to become even faster at detecting and notifying users of these fleeting price changes.
- **Optimized Search Results:** Search engines will use AI to better understand your search intent and present the most relevant and potentially cheapest options more effectively.
- **Integration with Other Travel Services:** Expect to see greater integration between flight booking platforms, accommodation sites, and activity booking platforms, potentially leading to bundled deals and more holistic travel planning alerts.

Essentially, AI and ML are helping to make flight search and price tracking more intelligent, efficient, and personalized. This means that the alerts we receive in the future could be even more targeted and timely, increasing our chances of securing those incredible deals.

### The Rise of Subscription Services and Curated Deals: Is It Worth Paying for Alerts?

While many basic flight alert services are free, there's a growing trend of premium or subscription-based services that offer curated deals and more in-depth analysis. Services like Scott's Cheap Flights or The Flight Deal are examples of this. They employ experts who actively search for exceptional deals, including mistake fares (when airlines accidentally price a flight incorrectly, often for a very low price), and then alert their subscribers.

Is it worth paying for these services? It really depends on your travel habits and goals:

- **Pros of Paid Services:**
    - **Curated Deals:** They often find truly exceptional deals that you might not find through standard search engines.
    - **Mistake Fares:** These services are particularly good at identifying and alerting subscribers to rare mistake fares, which can offer incredible savings.
    - **Time Savings:** They do the heavy lifting of searching for deals, saving you significant time and effort.
    - **Targeted Notifications:** Premium tiers often offer more specific alerts based on your preferred airports and destinations.
- **Cons of Paid Services:**
    - **Cost:** There's an annual or monthly fee involved.
    - **Flexibility Required:** Many of the best deals found by these services require a degree of flexibility in dates or destinations.
    - **Deal Velocity:** Mistake fares and other incredible deals often disappear very quickly, so you need to be prepared to book immediately.

For frequent travelers or those who are very flexible with their plans, a paid subscription service can absolutely pay for itself with just one or two incredible deals. For occasional travelers or those with rigid schedules, free alert services might be sufficient. Weigh your travel frequency, budget, and willingness to be flexible when considering whether a paid service is right for you.

### The Power of the Community: Utilizing Forums and Social Media for Deal Hunting

Don't underestimate the power of collective intelligence! Online travel forums, social media groups, and communities dedicated to finding cheap flights can be invaluable resources. These communities are often filled with passionate travelers who are constantly sharing deals they find, tips and tricks for booking, and insights into price trends.

How to leverage these communities alongside your **cheap airfare alerts**:

- **Join Relevant Forums and Groups:** Look for online communities focused on travel deals, specific airlines, or destinations you're interested in.
- **Follow Deal-Focused Social Media Accounts:** Many social media accounts are dedicated to sharing flight deals.
- **Engage with the Community:** Ask questions, share deals you find, and learn from the experiences of others.
- **Be Skeptical but Open:** While communities can be a great source of information, always verify any deals you find before booking.

Think of these communities as a network of eyes and ears, all on the lookout for those elusive low fares. Combining the automated power of your alerts with the human touch of these communities can give you a significant edge in the constantly changing world of flight pricing. It's about creating a collaborative ecosystem for finding cheap flights!

## Key Features Analysis

The coffee filter market has evolved substantially, with manufacturers focusing on materials, design, and environmental impact. The following analysis highlights critical features to consider when selecting a coffee filter.

**Material composition:**

The material used in a coffee filter directly impacts its effectiveness and the final coffee flavor. Paper filters are typically made from wood pulp or bamboo, with variations in thickness and processing. Reusable filters are constructed from materials like stainless steel,nylon,or organic cotton,each offering different levels of filtration and durability. Some advanced filters incorporate a combination of materials for optimal performance.

**filter Shape and Size:**

the shape and size of a coffee filter must match the brewing device for optimal performance. Cone-shaped filters are commonly used with pour-over brewers, while flat-bottom filters are designed for drip coffee makers. Basket filters are suitable for large-batch brewing, and specific sizes are available for different coffee maker models.Ensuring a proper fit prevents leaks, uneven extraction, and inconsistent brewing.

**filtration Capacity:**

The filtration capacity of a coffee filter refers to its ability to remove sediment and oils from the coffee grounds. Paper filters generally offer the highest level of filtration, resulting in a cleaner, less oily cup of coffee. Metal filters, on the other hand, allow some oils and fine particles to pass through, contributing to a richer, full-bodied flavor.Selecting the appropriate filtration level depends on individual taste preferences.

**ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:**

Reusable coffee filters require regular cleaning to maintain their performance and prevent buildup. Stainless steel filters are generally easy to clean with soap and water,while cloth filters may require more frequent and thorough rinsing. Some filters are dishwasher-safe, offering additional convenience.Proper cleaning and maintenance extend the lifespan of reusable filters and ensure consistent coffee quality.

**Environmental Sustainability:**

With growing environmental awareness, sustainability is becoming an increasingly important consideration for coffee filter selection.Reusable filters eliminate the need for disposable paper filters, reducing waste and environmental impact. Biodegradable paper filters made from lasting materials offer a more eco-pleasant option to traditional paper filters.

**Brewing Method compatibility:**

Different coffee filters are designed for specific brewing methods. Paper filters are versatile and compatible with most brewing devices,including pour-over,drip,and immersion methods. Metal filters are well-suited for pour-over and French press brewing, while cloth filters are traditionally used in cloth drip coffee makers and similar manual methods. Selecting a filter that complements the chosen brewing method is essential for optimal results.

## Core Benefits

Choosing the right coffee filter brings several key benefits that affect cup quality, habitat and budget.**Improved Coffee Clarity:** The right filter significantly reduces sediment and oils in the final brew. This clarity translates to a smoother mouthfeel and allows the subtle flavors of the coffee to shine through. Many users report a noticeable difference in taste clarity when switching to higher-quality filters,which enhances overall enjoyment.

**Enhanced Flavor Profile:** Different filters impact the oils that pass through the brew. Some users prefer the fuller flavor of coffee brewed with a metal filter.Others crave the cleaner,brighter cup frequently enough associated with paper filters. the ability to experiment with varying filtration levels allows users to fine-tune the flavor profile to their exact liking.

**Reduced Environmental Impact:** By switching to reusable or biodegradable filters, you directly reduce the volume of waste produced by disposable paper filters. This has direct,positive effects on resource usage and landfill waste. In addition, the use of sustainable material production can further reduce the environmental footprint.

**Long-Term Cost savings:** While the initial investment in a reusable filter might potentially be higher, the long-term cost savings are critically important.You eliminate the recurring expense of purchasing disposable paper filters, saving money over time. Many users find that the durability of high-quality reusable filters, such as stainless steel options, allows them to use them for years, which further optimizes the cost.

**Brewing Method Versatility:** Certain filter types perform exceptionally well within specific brewing methods. Correct filter selection leads to increased method efficiency and quality. Users get more from their favorite brewing systems.

## FAQs Section

Understanding the common questions surrounding coffee filters often improves purchase satisfaction. Here are some common concerns.

**Are all coffee filters compatible with all coffee makers?**
No, coffee filters are not universally compatible. Choosing the correct size and shape is essential. Refer to your coffee maker's instruction manual for specific filter recommendations. Some coffee makers require cone-shaped filters, while others use flat-bottom or basket filters. Using the wrong filter size can lead to leaks, overflows and potentially damage the brewing mechanism.

**How often should I replace my reusable coffee filter?**
The lifespan of a reusable coffee filter depends on the material and how well it's maintained. Stainless steel filters, when properly cleaned, can last for several years. Cloth filters may need replacement every few months. Signs of wear and tear, such as damage to the filter material, odors, or decreased filtration effectiveness, indicate it's time for a new filter.

**Can I reuse paper coffee filters?**
While technically possible, reusing paper coffee filters is generally not recommended. The filter becomes saturated with coffee oils and residue, which can negatively impact the flavor of subsequent brews. Additionally,used paper filters are more likely to tear or break during brewing and should be immediately discarded.

**What is the best way to clean a metal coffee filter?**
For stainless steel coffee filters,use warm,soapy water immediately after each use. Thoroughly rinse the filter to remove any remaining coffee grounds or residue. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scrub brushes, as they can damage the filter's surface.For more stubborn buildup, soak the filter in a mixture of water and baking soda or vinegar.

We have been dating for Our relationship has been in the small fights stage for a few months and he almost broke it off yesterday for good. The night before this we had had a bad phone call, I was asking for reassurance on something and he didn’t set a boundary of him needing to go to bed in order to think about things more since he as tired and processing things poorly because of that. I ended up calling him crying and he was just rude and when I said goodnight crying he hung up.
Yesterday we met up and decided to walk around some gardens, there I asked him to think on why he would treat me like that. By the time we got back to the car he was toying with the idea of breaking up, and ultimately was leaning towards breaking up. He said that he no longer felt the want to work on things when they got hard, that he didn’t have the motivation or energy to do so anymore and he says that’s the reason for his recent snarky remarks or inability to fully have hard conversations. I know it sounds like I should have jumped at the opportunity to end things if this is how he feels, but let me explain my side.
We have been dating since October, officially since December. For those months and into January I was myself. I never had an issue with him taking time for himself or hanging out around women or with his friends. In January I started the hormonal birth control pill. That’s when things changed. I began to wake up every morning in fight or flight mode. I constantly felt like I was just floating around or on the edge of a bad high. I couldn’t think straight, and I could feel things the way I used to. I spoke with friends and professionals and they said to give it 3-5 months for the symptoms to subside. So I did that. Now I feel as if my boyfriend has gotten the short end of the stick with me. I’m no longer myself, I don’t recognize the way I act. I jump and overreact at the smallest things. If he wants to go out to the bar I assume horrible things and I cannot explain what I am feeling or why I just feel everything 100x more without the ability to regulate it the way I had before. He’s president of a club at his college and he has to have mandatory coffees with people at certain times in the event year, whether it be for new members, new ideas, whatever. I’d be extremely upset and mad at him when he would have to grab coffee with a woman in the group. He’s started telling me he’s turned down hanging out with his female friends when they ask, or is scared to tell me he’s going to a bar or having coffee with someone and that hurts me to see him hurt like that. But I didn’t know how to not feel those things and react that way. I found myself constantly comparing myself to his pasts and hyper fixating and analyzing similarities and differences way more than I used to. For a month or two he lied about things from his past, how long he dated someone. Or he’d lie about something he did so I wouldn’t know why he had done something in his past so he could avoid me flipping out on it. And I know it sounds bad to agree with him but I would flip out, and I’d lie the same if I was dating someone who would do so.
I explained to him that I haven’t been me since I started the pill, and he and I both agreed this overwhelming change in me happened when I started it. I’m always angry, I can’t reasonably assess situations and I am stuck with the most horrible brain fog. I have been wanting to get off of it for a while but yesterday I was able to take the push to stop. He told me that we could continue, see if I return to my old self, which I pray I do because I can’t lose him to a version of me I don’t know, and I am so so upset at myself for starting this pill and having it do this to me. He said he would be here through the adjustment because he knows that it’ll be difficult. I just am so scared that I won’t return to my old self emotionally. The me who was so understanding and so positive and wanted to give people space for school or friends or just themselves when they needed it; not someone who would be angry all the time at everything, even the people who love me. I’m scared that I’ll get better but he’ll resent me for what that did to me and never want to work on things again. I understand his reasoning. I wouldn’t want to work on things if I was in his shoes and I’m surprised he has for so long. I know his snakiness and rudeness towards me now when I overreact is valid. It’s not ok, but I do understand it. He apologized for that and told me I don’t deserve that and that he wants to want to give me everything I deserve because I’m worthy of it, but he just doesn’t feel the push to because of how I’ve been acting.

Has anyone who has taken birth control dealt with this or something similar? Do these horrible emotions of anger and 24/7 flight or flight and headaches and brain fog go away? If you were in his shoes and saw improvement with me would you begin to want to work on things again?

He’s been the best boyfriend I’ve had and he’s had so much patience with me, I wouldn’t hate to have this end because of something I haven’t (as bad and as much of a cop-out as it sounds) been able to rly control.

i can’t stay in our house anymore. each day feels like i'm slowly suffocating. so, i asked my cousins if we could go out for coffee. i’m glad they agreed.

we traveled to a coffee shop an hour and a half away from our town. i loved the rainy weather, the droplets on the window, the cool breeze from the air conditioner, and the old relaxing songs playing on the way. i felt so alive. it was comforting and lifted the heavy feelings i've been carrying for weeks.

the gentle noise of a few people around the coffee shop, the serious and silly talks and laughter with my cousins, and the aroma of hot coffee that perfectly suits the weather, made me feel so grateful. 

this day reminded me that sometimes, all we need is to take a break and see the world outside. there are countless reasons to keep going, to find happiness, and to feel alive. we don’t have to drown in negative thoughts and emotions. instead, we need to swim through the waves and find a way out.",5,1748616213.0,MentalHealthPH,2,0.78,False

I have never written on here before. The only reason I am now is because although this happened a year ago it is still bothering me. Alright, so I am a 21 year old woman and last August (2024) my husband and I got married. Four months before we tied the knot I graduated from college where I had been living with one of my friends who I thought would be in the bridal party.

A little backstory, this friend (Calli) and I met at freshman orientation our first year of college. We got along really well right away and discovered that we lived just one floor away from one another in the same freshman dorm. We exchanged contact information, regularly getting coffee and hanging out that first semester of freshman year. I thought that she was super pretty and fun to hangout with and she seemed to be a very genuine person. Fast forward to the beginning of second semester freshman year. I was freaking out because the deadline for housing the upcoming year was fast approaching and I didn't have a roommate. At the college I went to, you could live in dorms or apartments on campus. I was hoping to live in the apartments as my home was out of state and I wanted more space and a kitchen which the dorms didn't have. This was when, to my relief, Calli texted me and asked if I'd want to room with her the next year. She told me that as the apartments have four bedrooms she and her roommate from freshman year had made a deal, saying that they would live together and then each invite another friend to live in the apartments with them. Immediately I said yes, glad to have a roommate and excited to be able to live in the apartments and to hopefully grow closer to Calli.

We reserved our apartment and ended the school year. Calli and I said our goodbyes as she lived in the state we went to school in and I headed back to my home state for the summer. That summer before heading back to school I got the greatest surprise of my life as my boyfriend (now husband) popped the question and asked me to marry him. Of course I said yes and we began planning our wedding for the following summer after I would have graduated from college.

Yes, I finished college in two years. No I'm not a genius, I took college classes (also known as PSEO) during my Junior and Senior year of high school so that I could graduate early.

After I got engaged I immediately started to think about who I would want in my wedding party. I am one of four girls so of course all of my sisters were my bridesmaids (I made them all my maid of honor as we are really close and I didn't want to have to choose). Then I asked one of my girl friends who my husband and I are close with and knew all through high school to also be a part of the wedding party. The last person that I was going to ask to be a part of the wedding was Calli, seeing as we got along really well and as we would be living together I assumed we would get really close over the next year.

A month after I got engaged college began and I was moving into the apartment with Calli and our other two roommates, Leacie (who was Calli's roommate the year before) and Kayla Leacie's friend. I didn't really know Leacie as we had only met once or twice through Calli and I had never met Kayla. The first few months of school went well as Calli and I hung out a lot and got to know Kayla really well who we loved spending time with and we all became really good friends. Leacie didn't hangout with us much as she had a boyfriend on campus and her class load kept her really busy. After a couple months of living together I wrote Calli a sweet note expressing how much I enjoyed our friendship along with a shirt that said ""bridesmaid"" as I asked her to be a part of my bridal party. She of course accepted and I was thrilled imagining the rest of the year going as it had so far, growing closer and spending lots of time together.

Then, the end of October came and Calli met Dylan, a guy in one of her classes. He asked her out and she agreed to the date. Kayla and I were super excited for her and encouraged her as she got ready assuring her that she looked great. We wanted this to go well, even if it didn't turn into anything seeing as (at the time)  Calli was still very hung up on her ex who she broke up with the year before, but still kept in touch. Her ex didn't seem to be a good person which Leacie experienced first hand so we all encouraged her to go on this date with Dylan and officially stop talking to her ex once and for all. This was a terrible idea.

She started dating Dylan and the two of them moved extremely fast physically. Although this might work for some people, Calli became extremely emotionally invested and Dylan, although he could act the part, wasn't in the same place emotionally. Two weeks into dating Calli discovered that Dylan was also seeing and sleeping with another girl that he had ""dated"" previously. This led to him and Calli breaking up, but eventually getting back together after about a week. This pattern of him cheating, Calli finding out, breaking up, and getting back together was something that continued until the end of school. It always turned out the same way, with them eventually back together. Every time that they would break up my roommates and I would always encourage Calli to block and delete his number, seeing as he was a walking red flag and incredibly toxic, saying that she deserved better. She would sometimes listen to us and block him, but always end up unblocking him eventually. Although Calli would constantly claim that she ""hates drama"" she seemed to have it follow her everywhere she went.

Alright so you are probably wondering how does this relate to her being or not being in my wedding party? Well, every time they were ""back together"" she was with him all of the time. And I mean ALL THE TIME. If they weren't physically together they were FaceTiming and if they weren't FaceTiming they were texting. She couldn't even go the weekend without seeing him when we planned a girls trip before Christmas break to DisneyLand, so she invited him along to join us. Eventually she spent more nights at his house than in our apartment. Dylan lived only five minutes off campus with some guys from the college's roller hockey team that he was on. Kayla would often go with Calli to the guys house as she got to know the guys and thought they were fun to hangout with. Her hanging out with them didn't really bother me as much as I knew she was mostly going to make sure Calli wasn't the only girl there, which was completely understandable. However, this left me in the apartment alone most nights.

There are a few reasons I didn't go with them to the guys house. First, they were all drinking and although that's fine for them, that really isn't my scene. Second, I felt weird going to hangout with these guys who were clearly just looking for hookups while I am in a committed relationship.

Not only was I left alone most nights in the apartment, but I was blown off every time I tried to plan a night to hangout with the girls. I was consistently told that we would ""reschedule"" only to have the rescheduled time also get moved back to a later date. The one time that we had plans to hangout like we did at the beginning of the year and I refused to ""reschedule"" our plans somehow I was the bad guy for saying ""no"" and it ended with Calli crying and storming off to see Dylan anyway. In all honesty I have gone over that moment so many times and I have absolutely zero clue how it played out like it did. Calli asked if we could just ""hang out later"". I said no, then she threw a fit about how dare I say that to her in front of our roommates (they were down the hall when we were talking), cried about how she hates drama while I just stood there watching her do her makeup to go see Dylan, and stormed off, not talking to me the rest of the night as she went to spend the evening with Dylan.

My breaking point came though one night in March. I am still so upset when thinking about this. Calli and Kayla had promised me that we would have the evening just the three of us like we did the first semester. They were just spending time with Dylan and the guys until dinner and then they said they would come back and we would watch a movie, do face masks, etc. This was fine with me as I was sure this time they would follow through on plans. I finished my assignments early and then spent the entire afternoon baking and getting ready to hangout with them. I made puppy chow, popcorn, homemade pizza for dinner, and chocolate chip cookies. I was so excited! I cleaned the kitchen as I worked and made sure the living room was completely vacuumed and ready as we usually brought our beds out there to lay on and watch a movie. As I took the last tray of homemade cookies out of the oven Calli called. I answered thinking that she was calling to say they were on their way back to the apartment which would've been perfect timing as I just finished making everything. Answering the FaceTime call it wasn't Calli on the other end but Dylan. He asked if it was alright if the girls hung out for a game night at their place. He told me that I could come too and as he had heard that I would be making cookies he picked up a cheap looking eight back of cookies from the store. I laughed, my voice cracking as I tried not to cry while on the phone telling him that no, I wasn't going to come as I had just taken the cookies out of the oven. He said, ""oh ok"" and gave me the dumbest fake sad face with his lip out that made me want to smack him.

After we hung up I collapsed on the kitchen floor in tears with my oven mitts still on. I cried so hard and couldn't catch my breath and I felt like I was having a panic attack. I know, that probably sounds insane. Having a panic attack over this? I didn't actually have one, but I was so distressed about being blown off for months and realizing that it really didn't seem like Calli cared how much she was hurting me. I couldn't stop crying that night. I was so mad and sad that the person I thought was my friend didn't seem to care about me at all. She was only concerned about herself and the fact that she was probably getting lucky that night. In fact, she was so selfish that she didn't even have the decency to ask if she could stay at their house herself, but rather had Dylan do it because she knew that if it was him asking I wouldn't be able to say no. To make matters worse I got a call from my parents that night who let me know that a close family friend had passed away. I have never cried as hard as I did that night. At first I cried because I was so sad and upset with Calli, but after getting that call I cried because I missed that family friend, I didn't get to say goodbye, and when I got that news I should've been supported by my friends.

That night I couldn't fall asleep as every time I tried I would just begin sobbing harder. In the morning I was finishing getting ready when I heard Calli and Kayla get home. I tried to put myself together and not show how much I had been crying even though I had been just a few moments before they got back. They came into my room and told me about their night as if they hadn't blown me off for the millionth time and then asked how my night had been. Although I tried to be nice and listen to them politely, my anger was burning so bad that I let them know my night totally sucked. Calli showed fake concern giving the most unapologetic apology before leaving the room to make plans with Dylan for the day. Kayla on the other hand was truly sorry and could see how much they had hurt me. After that Kayla made a real effort with me, making plans and sticking to them and the two of us got to know one another a lot better. Calli on the other hand continued on with Dylan and seemed to avoid me only wanting to chat if it was convenient for her i.e. if she and Dylan were on a break or she wanted sympathy because he cheated again.

As the end of the school year approached I wrestled with whether or not I would take Calli out of the wedding party. I talked to my fiance about it along with my parents who encouraged me to do what I felt was right. Although I didn't want to have that conversation with her seeing as I never thought I'd have to ask someone not to be my bridesmaid anymore and I am terrible at confrontation, I couldn't help but feel like our friendship was already over. I had pretty much made up my mind about Calli and the wedding when Kayla told me something interesting that Calli had told her. Kayla informed me that Calli said she was only still friends with me because she wanted to be in the wedding.

I made the hard choice to prevent Calli from being a bridesmaid after that. A couple of weeks before school ended we were the only two in the apartment. Her room door was closed so I knocked and sat down on her bed when she invited me in, telling her that I didn't want her in the wedding party anymore. I was as kind as I could be saying, not blaming her but saying that I felt like we had drifted apart over the year and become much less close than we previously were. I told her that I would still love it if she came to the wedding and was there to support me, but of course left it up to her. She was quiet as I talked, not really saying much, just sort of nodding along. I gave her a hug and then left her room feeling a weight lifted off my shoulders.

The idea that she was only friends with me to stay in the wedding was confirmed, after giving her the news as she didn't speak to me the rest of the semester. She avoided me like the plague staying in her room while she was home and I was there or going out with Dylan and on walks constantly.

While I felt bad that I had asked her not to be in my wedding party, I more so felt frustrated knowing that her parents and sister were probably getting some sob-story about how I was a terrible person for kicking her out of the wedding. Her parents, who I had met a few times as they lived about thirty minutes away from campus, were always kind to me. I wanted them to know that Calli's actions were the reason that she was no longer a part of my bridal party rather than whatever she was leading them to believe. I wanted them too to know the truth about how she was still seeing Dylan and was lying to them about it (which she had been doing for months). Of course I can't control what they think about me or her lying to them.

I wrapped up my classes and graduated then headed home to finish planning my wedding. Kayla came to cheer me on at the graduation and I didn't get so much as a ""goodbye"" from Calli before leaving. The wedding went splendidly. It worked out with Calli no longer being a part of the bridal party as the numbers for bridesmaids and groomsmen were now even. Kayla came to the wedding and got ready with me and the bridesmaids. She cheered me on throughout the day and helped to fix my hair as we took photos. I am so grateful to her and glad that our friendship has remained.

Calli and I have not talked since learning that she would not be coming to the wedding. She didn't reach out with congratulations after I got married, which I didn’t expect. Nor did she reach out after learning that I was starting chemo a month after the wedding (another long story). It sounds like she is still with Dylan, that is when he is back at the school for roller hockey things as he moved back to his home in Tennessee.

I am sad about how our friendship had to end and the fact that she still feels the need to chase after Dylan when she could do so much better. I am also sad that she is probably still lying to her parents and sister. I hope that someday she can see that it is alright to be single and she doesn't always need to be in a relationship. Most of all I hope that she knows I am trying to forgive her for being such a terrible friend.

Apologies for how long this post got, if you read all of the way through thank you and congratulations. Honestly there are a lot of things that happened that year between her and I and her and Dylan that I didn't include as I tried to make this as short as possible (even though it was still really long). In the end though was I wrong for asking her not to be in my wedding party?",1,1748616166.0,u_Significant_Tea_8214,0,1.0,False

That said, Mize & Lugo actually “faced off” back on April 19, and the game total came to 4 runs (resulting in a Tigers win…) Kansas City has only put 11 runs on the board over their last 4 outings, and Detroit has cashed the Under in 7 of their last 8 games. I’m on the Under to hit today.

I’m exhausted. Tired of the constant UTIs, the back pain, the sleepless nights, the missed days at work. Tired of vacations that end with me stuck in a bathroom. Tired of the fear every morning, not knowing if today will be manageable or if I’ll be in pain again. The fear of going to the bathroom and not knowing if it’s going to burn.

It all started almost four years ago. At first, it was once or twice a month. Then it became four or five times a month. Some months, I only had a few days without symptoms.

Not knowing what was causing it, I tried everything. I avoided pools and beaches. I was extremely careful with hygiene. I used the right pH soaps. I changed all my underwear to 100% cotton. I wore looser clothes. I changed soaps and detergents over and over. I always washed after sex or took full showers. Nothing worked. I tried several medications, but nothing made a difference.

I went to countless appointments with different doctors. The advice was always the same — rest more and drink more water. Eventually, I found a specialist who finally identified the bacteria through testing.

I started treatment with Uro-Vaxom, Hiprex, D-Mannose, and cranberry supplements. I followed strict dietary changes. I cut out spicy foods, acidic and citric foods, caffeine, and reduced my sugar intake. It’s been almost nine months of treatment.

But I still have flare-ups.

Is this my life now? Eating bland food while everyone else enjoys pizza. Taking eight pills a day without pause. Spending seven euros on incontinence pads. Not being able to drink a single coffee. Not knowing if I’ll ever be able to carry a pregnancy because the infection could harm the fetus.

Is this really how it’s going to be?

I feel like I have no hope left. I am tired of all of it. I’m only 22 years old, and instead of living my life, I’m stuck in the bathroom, in pain, declining plans and swallowing more pills than my 80-year-old grandfather.

I can't help but wonder who I was in a past life to be dealing with this.

Let’s break down the good, the bad, and the genuinely unhinged side of pre workouts.

The first time I tried pre workout was about a year ago an experiment because all my gym bros were on it and swore by the stuff.

**Fact**: it did give me a mental boost and a serious jolt of energy.

**Fun fact:** it also made me feel like I was being electrocuted from the inside. The tingling was so intense I jumped into the shower mid workout, hoping water would somehow fix my beta-alanine meltdown (*spoiler: it didn’t*). My heart was racing like it wanted out, I was sweating bullets, and sprinting around the hall like a golden retriever on Red Bull. Full zoomies mode. I’ll admit I might have a dash of undiagnosed ADHD, which probably didn’t help.

# Pre Workout Ingredients: Complete Breakdown

So what exactly turns a scoop of pre workout into the gym version of rocket fuel? What makes it pre workout and not just glorified flavored caffeine? Unlike whatever cocktail of toxicity and narcissism turned your girlfriend into your ex, there’s a specific brew behind the buzz. Let’s break down the not so secret ingredients that give pre workouts their magic what’s actually in that scoop, what each compound does, how much you *should* be taking, and why some blends feel like dark wizardry in disguise. Time to dissect the potion.

|**Ingredient**|**What It Does**|**Optimal Dose**|**Side Effects (Overdose/Sensitive)**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Caffeine**|Increases alertness, focus, endurance, and reduces perceived exertion|3–6 mg/kg body weight (150–300 mg)|Jitters, anxiety, insomnia, elevated heart rate, dependency|
|**Beta-Alanine**|Buffers lactic acid → delaying muscle fatigue|3.2–6.4 g/day|Tingling (paraesthesia), flushing, mild skin irritation|
|[**Creatine Monohydrate**](https://turbulencegains.com/creatine-monohydrate/)|Boosts ATP regeneration→ improves strength and power output|3–5 g/day|Water retention, bloating (rare), mild GI discomfort|
|**L-Citrulline Malate**|Increases nitric oxide → better pumps, blood flow, endurance|6–8 g (1:2 ratio with malate)|GI upset, flatulence if overdosed|
|**L-Arginine**|Older pump ingredient, less bioavailable than citrulline|6–10 g|Poor absorption, possible GI issues|
|**L-Tyrosine**|Enhances cognitive performance under stress|500–2,000 mg|Headache, nausea (high doses)|
|**Taurine**|Supports hydration, reduces cramps, boosts endurance|1–2 g|Rare, but can cause hypotension or sedation in sensitive users|
|**Theanine**|Calms without sedation; balances caffeine's intensity|100–200 mg (1:1 ratio with caffeine)|Minimal occasionally drowsiness in high doses|
|**Theacrine**|Caffeine like stimulant, longer lasting, less tolerance build up|100–300 mg|Similar to caffeine, but less potent anxiety, irritability|
|**Yohimbine**|Fat loss aid, stimulant, boosts adrenaline and blood flow|0.2 mg/kg (max \~15 mg/day)|High blood pressure, anxiety and panic attacks. Also banned in some countries|
|**Synephrine (Bitter Orange)**|Stimulant, used for fat loss and energy|10–20 mg|Heart palpitations, dizziness, banned in several countries|
|**Glycerol (Hydromax/Mono)**|Hyper hydrating → better pumps, endurance|1–3 g (HydroMax); 10–20 g (mono)|Bloating, diarrhea (especially with insufficient water intake)|
|**B-Vitamins**|Support energy metabolism and neurotransmitters|Varies by type (B6, B12, niacin etc.)|Flushing (niacin), nausea (excess B6), mostly harmless in moderation|
|**Nitrates (Beetroot extract)**|Increase NO production → endurance + blood flow|400–800 mg of nitrates (\~6–8 mmol)|Beet colored urine, GI upset|
|**Electrolytes (Na, K, Mg)**|Replenish salts lost in sweat, prevent cramping|Varies: 200–400 mg Na, 100–200 mg K|Rare, but hypernatremia if taken excessively|

Now let’s talk about the elephant in the room: proprietary blends. These sneaky little villains are the supplement industry’s version of “trade secrets.” But instead of guarding some brilliant game changing formula they mostly protect the companies’ ability to throw in whatever they want without telling you how much. Curious about how much caffeine or beta alanine you're actually getting in your pre workout supplements? Tough luck. Instead you get a vague mystery mix with a fancy name like “Performance Matrix” or “Energy Complex” and you’re just supposed to trust it’ll do the job.

**Spoiler alert:** more often than not this means underdosed ingredients overpriced scoops and zero transparency. If you’re paying for gains you deserve to know exactly what you’re putting into your body not play a guessing game. So next time you spot “proprietary blend” on a label raise an eyebrow and maybe raise a glass of water instead.

# The Good: What Research Says Works

Alright, let’s kick things off with the good because not all pre workouts supplements are just colorful sugar bombs that make you jitter like you’ve had three espressos and zero chill. When the stars align and the science backs it up, these bad boys can turn you into a gym superhero more energy, sharper focus, and strength gains that make you feel like you might just bench press a small car (or at least a hefty suitcase). So buckle up, because here’s the legit science on why pre workouts can be your workout’s best friend.

# 1. Pre Workout Supplements Boost Sprint Endurance and Energy System Efficiency

Figueiredo, C., Lira, F.S., Rossi, F.E. *et al.* Multi-ingredient pre workout supplementation changes energy system contribution and improves performance during high-intensity intermittent exercise in physically active individuals: a double-blind and placebo controlled study. *J Int Soc Sports Nutr* 17, 30 (2020).

[**Read Study**](https://rdcu.be/en02o)

**What they did:**

* **Participants**: 12 recreationally active males
* **Design**: Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled crossover
* **Protocol**: Repeated 15 second maximal treadmill sprints interspersed with 15 second rest until exhaustion
* **Supplement**: MIPS containing caffeine (300 mg), creatine (3.5 g), beta alanine (2 g), citrulline malate (6 g), arginine, tyrosine, taurine, and B vitamins
* **Placebo**: Flavor matched maltodextrin beverage

**Key findings:**

* Time to exhaustion increased by 18% (mean 20 min vs. 17.0 min placebo)
* The number of sprints completed increased by 14% (mean 41 vs 36)
* ATP CP and oxidative energy system contributions were significantly higher (+28% and +24%) in the MIPS condition
* Glycolytic system contribution increased, but not significantly

**Bottom line:**

If your workouts feel like your gas tank empties in five minutes flat, this kind of pre can squeeze out extra laps before the crash. It taps into your body's fast and clean fuel systems. Not magic, but definitely more juice in the engine.

# 2. Pre Workout Increases Focus and Energy Without Strength Gains

Kedia, A.W., Hofheins, J.E., Habowski, S.M., Ferrando, A.A., Gothard, M.D., Lopez, H.L. (2014). Effects of a Pre workout Supplement on Lean Mass, Muscular Performance, Subjective Workout Experience and Biomarkers of Safety. International Journal of Medical Sciences, 11(2), 116-126.

[**Read study**](https://www.medsci.org/v11p0116.htm)

**What they did:**

* **Participants**: 43 resistance trained men and women
* **Design**: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week training study
* **Supplement**: Pre workout containing creatine monohydrate (3 g), betaine (2.5 g), caffeine (180 mg), and dendrobium extract
* **Placebo**: Calorie free flavored drink with similar amount of caffine

**Key findings:**

* Significant increase in subjective energy and focus reported by participants
* Small but statistically significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\~3–5 mm Hg)
* No significant improvements in muscle strength or lean body mass compared to placebo

**Bottom line:**

Felt like a vibe boost, not a power boost. You'll be wired and ready, but don’t expect your PRs to magically skyrocket just from this. Great for feeling like a gym superhero. Just maybe not lifting like one.

# 3. Cardiovascular Effects of Pre workout

Bella YF, Cupido SRS, Inacio PAQ, Sobral MLP, Vieira RP. Pre Workout Supplements and Their Effects on Cardiovascular Health: An Integrative Review. *J Cardiovasc Dev Dis*. 2025;12(4):112. Published 2025 Mar 24.

[**Read study**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40278171/)

**What they did:**

* **Scope**: Integrative review of 24 studies evaluating cardiovascular responses to MIPS
* **Participants**: Healthy adults and athletes
* **Supplements**: Various MIPS formulations, often with high caffeine doses (>200 mg)

**Key findings:**

* Mixed effects: some studies found reductions in blood pressure and LDL cholesterol
* Others found increases in resting heart rate and blood pressure, especially at high caffeine doses
* Individual responses varied widely depending on caffeine sensitivity and supplement composition

**Bottom line:**

Caffeine hits everyone different. If your pre makes your heart drum louder than your gym playlist, it’s not “working better”- it’s just overdosed for you. Know your limit. Respect your heart.

# The Bad: Pre workout side Effects & Overhyped Promises

But of course, with great power comes great... *crash potential.* Now that we’ve hyped up the good, let’s slide into the pre workout side effects that doesn’t get its own flashy marketing video. Because for every tub that gives you laser focus and Hulk strength, there’s one that leaves you itchy, dizzy, bloated, or wondering if your heart’s trying to break up with you mid set.

Some ingredients? Under dosed. Others? So over dosed they could probably power a small lawnmower.

# 1. Boosted Energy & Focus, but Side Effects Are Common

Jagim, A. R., Camic, C. L., & Harty, P. S. (2019). Common Habits, Adverse Events, and Opinions Regarding Pre Workout Supplement Use Among Regular Consumers. Nutrients, 11(4), 855.

[**Read Study**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6520716/)

**What they did:**

* Distributed an online survey via social media to adult males and females who reported regular use of multi ingredient pre workout supplements (MIPS). 1,045 responded, with **872 completing** the survey (males: 636;females: 233)

**Key findings:**

**Long term use was common:**

* 72.2% of users had been taking MIPS for over 1 year (630 out of 872 participants)
* MIPS were used frequently throughout the week
* The majority took them 4 or 5 days per week, with 24.1% using them 4 times and 24.3% using them 5 times weekly

The most common reasons for using MIPS (Multi Ingredient Pre Workout Supplements) included:

* Increased energy and mental focus by 89% of participants (776 users)
* Improved muscular endurance reported by 37.3% (325 users)
* Enhanced muscle pumps or better blood flow mentioned by 37.0% (322 users)

**Dosing patterns varied:**

* While most users took a single serving per workout
* 14% took two or more servings at once
* 18% used MIPS more than once per day

Adverse side effects were reported by over half (54%) of users, with common complaints including:

* Skin reactions (e.g. tingling or flushing)
* Heart related symptoms (e.g. palpitations or irregular heartbeat)
* Nausea or digestive discomfort
* Women were more likely to experience side effects, despite typically taking smaller doses than men

**Bottom Line**

Pre workouts are like a boost of energy and focus to get you going in the gym. But watch out lots of people, especially women, get side effects like jitters or upset stomachs. Don’t go overboard by taking extra scoops or stacking with other caffeine stuff. Play it safe and listen to your body.

# 2. Cardiovascular Safety Risks with Synephrine

de Jonge MLL, Kieviet LC, Sierts M, Egberink LB, van der Heyden MAG. Review of Case Reports on Adverse Events Related to Pre workout Supplements Containing Synephrine. *Cardiovasc Toxicol*. 2023;23(1):1-9.

[**Read Study**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36639595/)

**What they did:**

* Systematically reviewed case reports up to August 2021 from PubMed and Google Scholar, identifying 30 case reports involving 35 patients who experienced medical complaints after using p-synephrine containing supplements.

**Key findings:**

* **Symptoms:** The most frequent presentations included chest pain, palpitations, syncope, and dizziness.
* **Diagnoses:** Commonly ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, and cerebrovascular events; 5 patients remained disabled or on long term medication at last follow up.
* **Confounders:** Many supplements combined synephrine with caffeine, making it difficult to isolate synephrine’s exact role.

**Bottom line:**

Synephrine sounds fancy, but it can mess with your heart pretty badly. If you have any heart problems or are sensitive to stimulants, don’t gamble with this ingredient; it’s like playing Russian roulette with your chest. Stick to safer fuels unless you want to risk more than just a shaky workout.

# 3. Enhanced Muscular Endurance

Harty, P.S., Zabriskie, H.A., Erickson, J.L. *et al.* Multi ingredient pre workout supplements, safety implications, and performance outcomes: a brief review. *J Int Soc Sports Nutr* 15, 41 (2018).

[**Read Study**](https://rdcu.be/en9BS)

**What they did:**

* Reviewed the theoretical rationale and available placebo controlled trials on MIPS blends of caffeine, creatine, β-alanine, amino acids, and nitric oxide agents, focusing on both acute (single dose) and chronic (≥8 weeks) ingestion outcomes.

**Key findings:**

* **Acute effects:** Consistent improvements in muscular endurance and subjective mood during exercise; mixed results for force and power production.
* **Chronic effects:** When combined with a periodized resistance training program, MIPS use led to greater lean mass gains compared to training alone.
* **Safety:** Short term use (<8 weeks) appears safe; long term safety data are lacking. Proprietary blends with undisclosed dosages raise concerns about inadvertent ingestion of banned or contaminated substances.

**Bottom line:**

Multi ingredient pre workouts can help you work out longer, feel better, and even gain some muscle. But most studies only look at short term use, so we don’t know what happens if you use them for a long time. Also, some products don’t clearly show what’s inside, so be careful and pick ones that are honest about their ingredients.

# What These Pre Workout Studies Didn’t Tell You

Even the most clinical sounding trials can be shakier than your fourth scoop of caffeine. Here’s where the studies on pre workout supplements fall short for your wallet, your gains, and your sanity.

# Short Term Hype Without Long Game Insight

**Duration check**  
Most trials ran for a single session. You scoop it, lift heavy for an hour, maybe measure a few heartbeats, and that’s it.

No one is checking in at month three to see if your kidneys are crying or your sleep is wrecked. No year long performance logs. No ""bro, you still alive?"" follow-ups.

**The takeaway**  
These trials test the sprint, not the marathon. Long term effects, tolerance buildup, crashes, or chronic fatigue risks are still in the dark.

# Proprietary Blends Mean Legal Voodoo

Most top sellers list ingredients under proprietary blends. That’s a fancy way of saying, “We won’t tell you how much of anything you’re getting.” Could be 300 milligrams of caffeine. Could be 50. Could be creatine or just overpriced baking soda.

Some blends even skip clinical doses and sprinkle just enough for label decoration.

**The takeaway**  
Buying pre workouts without disclosed doses is like entering a boxing ring blindfolded. You might feel something, but you won’t know what hit you.

# No Real World Chaos Allowed

**Lab conditions are too clean**  
Participants eat clean, sleep well, train on schedule. Diet is controlled. No cheat meals. No skipped workouts. Basically a monk’s life with dumbbells.

**Real life?**  
You’re running on 4 hours of sleep, missed breakfast, crushed 2 Red Bulls and a samosa, then hit push day. How does your pre workout perform then?

**The takeaway**  
These trials are done in fitness utopia, not real life mess. We need pragmatic studies that reflect chaos, inconsistency, and gym bro reality.

# Limited Outcome Measures

Most studies measured:

* Time to exhaustion
* Number of reps to failure
* Subjective ""how hyped did you feel"" ratings

But almost none tracked real long term strength gains, injury rates, sleep patterns, mood changes, or whether you still love the gym after three months of high stim usage.

**The takeaway**  
Just because you squeezed out two more reps does not mean it is a net win. Real performance is more than what you lift for a day.

# Industry Bias and Conflict of Interest

Some studies were company funded. Some didn’t even disclose funding. Others came from journals that only publish positive results. Coincidence? Maybe. But where are the trials that say, “Hey, this stuff didn’t work”?

**The takeaway**  
Publication bias is real. You see the hype, not the flops. Always check who funded the study and if the authors have skin in the supplement game.

# One Dimensional Health Profiles

All participants were young, healthy, and fit. No chronic illness. No medication. Normal BMI. Basically elite Instagram models in lab coats.

What about:

* People with hypertension
* Diabetics
* Women with thyroid issues
* Lifters in their 40s
* People on antidepressants
* Former athletes with wear and tear

**The takeaway**  
We do not know how these formulas work for the rest of us with less than perfect health profiles.

# Side Effects Are Barely Logged

Nausea, jitters, racing heart, sleep issues, crash effects, mood swings — all that juicy reality is either “not significant” or just not mentioned.

**The takeaway**  
Lack of data does not mean it’s safe. It means no one asked the hard questions or tracked what actually matters once the gym buzz fades.

# So… Should You Use a Pre Workout?

Imagine mixing 300 mg of caffeine, tingles, beetroot powder, and vague promises of vascularity into a shaker and hoping it’ll fix your motivation crisis. That’s pre workout. Powerful? Sometimes. Necessary? Rarely. Safe? Depends on whether your scoop looks like a science experiment or a gamble. Let’s figure out when it’s actually worth it.

# You might benefit from a pre workout if:

* You’re dragging yourself into the gym sleep deprived, underfed, or emotionally bruised from your last squat attempt that folded you like a lawn chair.
* Your workouts are high volume or high intensity, and you actually need the help mentally, physically, or just to get through your absurdly long superset playlist.
* You’ve already dialed in the basics: sleep, hydration, nutrition, consistency. Pre is just the cherry on top, not the foundation.
* You know what you’re taking, why you’re taking it, and how much is in a scoop. No blind chugging mystery blends with names like “Thermonuclear Gutsplosion.”
* You’re not hypersensitive to caffeine, niacin, beta alanine, or, well, reality.

# You should probably avoid pre workouts if:

* You’ve had panic attacks, jittery episodes, or moments where your heart did the Macarena mid deadlift.
* You’re already drinking two to three cups of coffee a day and your adrenals are toast.
* You stack it with fat burners or energy drinks and wonder why your sleep feels like a deleted scene from Fight Club.
* You’re a beginner. Your gains will come from food, form, and consistency. Not from stimming your soul out of your body.
* You don’t know what’s in your pre because the label says “proprietary blend” and you just trusted the lightning bolts on the tub.

# My take?

Pre-workouts are tools. Not essentials. Not villains. Just tools.

Used right, they can help you push through a tough session with better focus, energy, and drive. Used wrong, they can fry your nervous system, kill your sleep, and leave you twitching in a cold shower wondering why your ears feel like static radio.

If you’re going to use them:

* Start with half a scoop and see how your body responds.
* Track more than just energy. Look at your appetite, mood, sleep, and recovery.
* Cycle off every few weeks. Your receptors need a break, and you don't want to rely on a chemical jumpstart just to do three sets of incline press.

Most importantly, don’t make pre workouts your emotional support supplement. If your session collapses without them, you’ve got bigger issues than caffeine tolerance.

# Smarter Alternatives

Not vibing with the idea of snorting 300 mg of caffeine and praying to the supplement gods you don’t ascend mid leg day? Good. You’ve got options smart, safer, and surprisingly effective alternatives that won’t make your skin crawl or your soul leave your body.

**1. Good Old Caffeine**

Sometimes the simplest fix is the best. 100–200 mg of plain caffeine in pre workout from coffee or caffeine pills hits the sweet spot for most people. No weird blends. No mystery dust. Just the same compound minus the dramatic marketing. Pair with a banana, and you’re good to go.

Bonus: Caffeine alone has been shown in multiple studies to enhance strength and power. It’s not inferior.

**2. Carbs Before Barb**

One of the most overlooked pre workout hacks: eat some actual food. A small carb rich snack like fruit, oats can fuel your workout better than any overpriced scoop of neon powder. Glycogen is king when it comes to crushing reps.

**3. Hydration + Electrolytes**

You think you’re tired, but really you’re just dry. Dehydration kills performance. A pinch of sea salt in your water or an electrolyte tab pre gym can help sustain energy and pump without frying your nervous system.

**4. Breathwork & Mental Cues**

Sometimes all you need is the right headspace. Quick box breathing or a personal hype ritual can do more than a stim bomb. Remember Ronnie didn’t need 400 mg of caffeine. He needed a camera and the words “YEAHH BUDDY.”

**5. Build Your Own Pre Workout**

Don’t like the shady “proprietary blend” game? Make your own:

* **Caffeine**: 150–200 mg
* **Creatine monohydrate**: 3–5 g
* **Beta-alanine**: 2–3 g (if you’re into tingles)
* **Citrulline malate**: 6–8 g
* **salt + water**: For pump and hydration

No surprises. No label lies. Just what works.

# Conclusion: Choose Wisely, Lift Wisely

Pre workouts can be the gym rat’s best wingman or a chaotic ex who shows up uninvited with heart palpitations and a tingling vendetta. Sure, the right formula can dial you in, slap some focus into your skull, and push you through brutal sets but the wrong one might have you pacing the locker room like you just chugged jet fuel.

""The science isn't dismissive pre workout supplements have legit benefits. More power, better endurance, maybe even an edge in muscle gain. But there are also pre workout side effects: underdosed pre workout ingredients, shady proprietary blends, and enough caffeine to start a small rave.

If your caffeine tolerance is sky high, your diet’s in check, and you’ve double checked the label like a paranoid chemist you’ll probably be fine. If not? You’re better off with a strong black coffee, a banana, and a playlist that makes you feel like a menace.

Remember, no scoop can replace grit. Progress comes from consistency, not caffeine induced euphoria. Lift smart, don’t chase the stim dragon, and always know what you’re putting in your body especially if it makes your ears itch.

1kz5r1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1kz5r1v/reaching_out_for_support/,Reaching out for support.,"Been a rough journey . Been lurking here for a while and always helps knowing im not alone. Always prone to migraines mainly hormonal but after pregnancy way worse. Then got blessed with a brain abcess and surgery a few years ago and endometriosis!!

After trying lexapro, aimovig, bunch of triptans i saw a headache specialist who has offered different options (ajovy, possibly seizure med, different meds with antidepressant plus migraine qualities). ive been on nurtec without amazing success but no side effects so feels safe and quells the constant pain at least. Nothing miraculous, but definitely doesnt make things worse And helps a bit).

Since my endo seems to have come back with a vengeance after my surgery last year,my ob suggests full hysterectomy and remove everything. I dont want to do surgery atm. Then she suggested orlissa but that seems extremely severe (triggering early menopause and then cant take it long term, so id have to have the surgery). im seeing if theres any other options. My migraines definitely have hormonal component- so maybe some sort of hormone pill could help.

Ive had aphasia before so dont want to try topomax. Im scared to try ajovy after reading here so currently trying to start coQ10 , switch to nurtec as a preventative to take more often, doing emdr therapy which supposedly may help, and all sorts of massage therapies which help but cost so much.

Im just tired of always being in pain either my head or my uterus area and Im glad I can function but how do you guys decide which meds to try? Aimovig worked at first but then i got a bad rash, joint pain, digestive problems… all of these meds have side effects. The triptans just bring on worse symptoms for me.

My drs provide options but it seems to be trial and error with different pills/shots? And isnt that hard to go through different side effects? Not sure why Im posting really … just tired of all of this. Going to try quitting coffee june 1 (switch to tea and then taper down) to see if im better off caffeine. Just all seems so miserable. And Im tired of it all.

Last year I went on vacation to Croatia and as I was near an Audi service center I swung by to ask about an oil and filter change for it. 

They charged me 214€. Did it on spot. Official Audi/Porsche service provider. 

I made an appointment with an official service center in Germany. I was expecting to pay 600€-900€ wich is okay in my opinion but still a lot for an oil change. 


I went there, waited 20min. Had a coffee, looked at the new A5 and A6 and the service dude came, looked at the car and said. 

You need an oil change, filters, and Transmition oil needs to be changed. Everything else seems to be okay. 

That will be 1553,66€.

The oil change was 608€ and the oil transmition was 390€. everything else was the filters and the work time. That was with 20% discount that they are having because it was newly opened.

1kz5kze,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1kz5kze/what_started_your_anxiety_journey/,What started your anxiety journey?,"Hey guys. I'd love to use this sub for all of us around the world to discuss together and help each other. Or maybe just read if you'd rather. There will be a point I want to post to discuss adult anxiety. But today I'd like to focus on childhood and teenage years. Although not all many of us started anxiety symptoms when we were young and didn't know. Or these painful years brought about our anxiety. Some teens might be experiencing this now! I'd love to share what led me to anxiety I never realized. 

  
Childhood anxiety- I was a skittish child, and I never understood that was anxiety. I hated sleeping alone and would often go to my parents' bedroom. If the wind blew, I became paranoid it was going to be a storm and had to go inside. At a young age, I worried about people dying, and if I couldn't find them, I had separation anxiety. I also had a loving home, but one where tempers flared. Yelling, throwing, and breaking things was common. Coffee tables turned over. Spankings and once a belt was used for punishment. 

Adolescence- Incredibly shy as a child I never understood math. I had major anxiety over having to read out loud, answer questions, and having to go up and do math I knew I couldn't do. I was that kid who prayed not to get called on. Counted the number of people in front of me. Felt instant relief when the nightmare was done. I was quiet and a bit weird and that made me such a target for bullying. People would do things like pretend to flirt with me in front of classmates to make them laugh. Never mind the unwanted touching. 

P.E was a whole other nightmare because I was never good. Looking back, I'm discovering signs of ADHD, Autism, motor skill disorders. Anxiety, Depression, PCOS. I would get made fun of for not being able to run or do exercises correctly. When I was forced to play on teams, nobody wanted to choose me and would argue over who had to take me. If they lost their game, they blamed me. I once had a girl so disgusted she had to play tennis with me she said ""She sucks!"" while laughing. Another student giggling said ""She's right behind you.""

The student continued to laugh and said ""I'm not trying to be mean but she sucks!"" I had to change in the bathroom stall because of what PCOS does to the body. Other students would laugh at me for changing in the bathroom. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome is a whole other nightmare. I had a panic attack in class, and the teacher tried to help me through it..... the class giggled throughout and some wanted to know what happened. You can bet your butt I hated school and most of those people at that time.

Today we set the time and place, so it's all going well so far. She seems pretty nervous herself but so am I so I can't blame her! I didn't use the word ""date"" when asking her out but I'm near certain she got the idea.

I am very friendly and outgoing with people I know well, and though her and I have had some great talks and I'm much more at ease, I can still feel a little anxious when we're talking, so hopefully I can keep it together tomorrow.

I know its like 10-15 bucks more, but not having to deal with crowds and parking and all that shit. Been using it way more since I have some extra cash laying around. I used to judge everyone who paid for grocery delivery thinking it was just for lazy rich folks, but honestly it's a game changer. I can shop in my pajamas, avoid the Sunday afternoon chaos at the store and I don't end up with random snacks I definitely didn't need just because they were on display.  
The time savings alone is worth it like I can get groceries ""done"" in like 10 minutes while I'm having my morning coffee instead of losing my entire Saturday afternoon. Plus my car doesn't smell from all the food lol.

You need to fix 1 or 2 invisible problems that are quietly driving people away. Get a free fix today!

Hey, I’m Luan Varela. I design, fix, and optimize websites—and one thing I see all the time is this:

> The site looks clean.
It loads.
It’s technically “done.”
...But it doesn’t convert. 🧍‍♂️



And no one knows why.

It’s not always bad design. A lot of the time, it’s small stuff—silent killers that hurt sales, leads, or sign-ups without you even realizing it.

Here are 8 sneaky problems I’ve fixed on client sites that might be holding yours back:


---

✅ 1. Mobile load speed is trash

If it takes 5+ seconds to load on mobile, people bounce. Most traffic is mobile now—speed = money.

✅ 2. Your CTA is hiding

If I land on your site and don’t immediately know what to do (book, buy, learn more), that’s a lost visitor.

✅ 3. It looks good, but feels wrong

Bad spacing, weird alignment, or heavy fonts on mobile kill the vibe instantly. It feels ""off""—so users leave.

✅ 4. You’re not solving a clear problem

If your homepage starts with “We are a company that…” instead of “Here’s what we help you fix”—you're missing the mark.


---

👀 Now the lesser-known ones:

⚠️ 5. Conflicting visual cues

Too many buttons, pop-ups, or sliding elements make your site feel chaotic. One clear action always beats 5 confusing ones.

⚠️ 6. Hidden forms that hurt trust

If your contact form is too small, buried in a footer, or missing entirely—you’re making it hard to connect. Bonus mistake: asking for way too much info.

⚠️ 7. No content depth (aka: Google doesn't know what you do)

A one-pager with 100 words won’t rank or convert. Pages need context: service breakdowns, FAQs, testimonials, case studies—all that stuff helps people and Google understand you.

⚠️ 8. You're sending traffic to a homepage instead of a landing page

Homepages are like lobbies. Landing pages are like sales reps. If you’re running ads to a generic homepage, you're wasting money.


---

If you’ve got a site and it’s not doing what you hoped—send me a link. I’ll look at it and give you real feedback and how to fix it.

Everyone is welcome to share their links, ill audit as many as possible for free or a small coffee if you'd like to help. ☕️[Coffee](https://ko-fi.com/adexra)

Both single parents, both looking to date so it felt like fate at the time. We clicked instantly (mind you before him I hadn’t even looked at a guy in over 5 years lol). 

After about 4 weeks he got sent away for work for a couple of months and sure it was sad but I just knew it was something special, little did I know during this time of him speaking to me everyday day he was speaking/sleeping with 10 plus other women. When he came back I knew instantly and we agreed to just be friends because he “didn’t want to hurt me” - I know right there and then I should’ve cut contact but I didn’t. I was just glad I haven’t slept with him myself. 

As time went on we were hanging out more and more, he was telling me all about the dates he was going on, he was coming over for dinner, I was helping him do his washing, we were going out on day trips, coffee dates, phone calls, helping eachother study you name it every day it was something. Eventually one thing led to another and we slept together. This snowballed, and brought us closer and closer. Our kids ended up meeting and we would have play dates, sleepovers, I met his babymother and even had play dates with her. Took them on all sorts of adventures all while telling everyone that we were just friends. While he was still dating and sleeping with other girls. I know I agreed to it, I knew he was doing but as time went on it hurt more and more. I felt trapped. 

This is where it gets difficult, after months and months of this “happy family” I tried to stop it, many times. Told him I didn’t want us sleeping together anymore as it was hurting me and he’d agree and then get jealous over something and sleep with me again. After months and months of this I was at my breaking point I knew I had fallen for him, or at least fallen for the idea of having a family…. It was so nice to have someone there to help, to listen, to care etc that I had ignored all my pain for so long. 

He called me his best friend to everyone, got a tattoo for me ? anyways he started to get closer to one of the girls he was dating and wanted to make it official with her. So he asked if I could meet her. That’s when I lost it, totally broke down, I said no I can not be In your life anymore. It’s not fair on me, it’s not fair on her and it’s not fair on my daughter. Now he’s throwing it in my face saying I’m not being a good friend and he is struggling with the fact that he is “abandoning” my daughter. That he doesn’t want to lose his best friend…. AITAH ?

***""I hugged him and I picked him up. Me and him always pretended we fought. We sucker-punched each other. We were goofing off. He seemed normal to me.""*** – Kim talking about seeing Eric at the prom afterparty

*Kim Carlin, a co-worker at Blackjack and classmate of Eric and Dylan, said:* ***""I don't think Dylan fit into us very well. He was too quiet. We would get into massive food fights or water fights. He wasn't into playing with us. If you would ask him something embarrassing he'd turn red and give you this little grin.""***

*I just want to be surrounded by the flesh of a woman, someone like [redacted] who I wanted to just fuck like hell, she made me practically drool, when she wore those shorts to work… I couldn't stop staring.* – It’s speculated that Eric wrote this about either Kim or Jen Laufenberg.

**Joshua Uncapher** stated Dylan, Eric, Chuck, and Chris all talked about making, detonating, and getting recipes for pipe bombs while working at Blackjack Pizza. Uncapher also stated Harris had talked about getting a recipe for bomb making, and trying to get to others to use it. Uncapher also stated he remembers a time when Chris Morris had a knife pulled on him, and that he pulled a knife on that same individual. Uncapher described Eric and Dylan as helpful at the store and people who seemed to be okay. Uncapher stated Dylan and Eric talked in German at Blackjack Pizza, (Eric and Dylan mostly, and Chris Morris too). Uncapher stated he did remember Eric Harris asking him at one time to buy him a .44 mag pistol sometime in 1998.

**Mark Esquibel** was unaware of any discussion by Harris, Klebold or the others related to guns or bombs. Around July 4, 1998 they had bought a lot of fireworks from a nearby vendor and lit several of them behind the store. Former store manager Bob Kirgis told him that about 1 ½  years ago, Harris had brought a pipe bomb into the store. Esquibel used to see Nate and Chris wear black duster coats, and Harris a traditional trench coat.

**Richard Harrell** knew Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold from his employment. He never associated with Harris. Klebold or Chris Morris away from work. Harrell said that he knew Klebold just as a “hello acquaintance” and knew Harris and Morris somewhat better. Harrell said that his observation was that Harris and Klebold seemed to be together most of the time and that Morris was frequently with them.

He also heard the words “pipe bomb” during a conversation between Harris, Klebold and Morris but doesn’t know which one spoke them. He said that Morris in particular seemed to have an affinity for fire and fireworks and that he had seen Morris lighting fireworks in the parking lot behind the restaurant on more than one occasion. He also remembers having returned to the store after a delivery in the summer of 1998 and what he describes as German polka music was being played on a radio or cassette deck by Harris and Morris.

Harrell has a vague recollection of Harris having brought a dark colored duffel bag or backpack to work but doesn’t remember how many times or when. Harrell said that his impression was that Klebold was a follower and Harris and Morris were more leader types. He said that Harris would occasionally become upset about things at work and that Morris frequently would. He also said that Harris, Klebold and Morris all occasionally wore dark trench coats to work but he had never seen them in “gothic” garb such as makeup or amulets, collars etc. He also said that Harris usually went out of his way to wait on female customers.

**Nathan Johnson** heard Chris Morris talk about while working at Blackjack Pizza. Morris used to talk about making grenades. He appeared to be the “ringleader.” Morris would also talk about buying grenades. Morris would do all the talking and Klebold and Harris would just listen. Morris claimed that he learned how to make grenades from the Internet. During these conversations and others, Harris and Klebold said almost nothing. Johnson stated he never really talked to Klebold. Morris also used to talk about firearms.

One time Johnson showed a knife to Morris and Harris, a knife his wife had gotten him. Morris talked about it. Harris stated he really did not know anything about knives. Harris and Klebold used to light fires out in the back of the Pizza store. They would light fires in old coffee cans. Harris was always playing with fire. He would take an entire box of matches and try to light it on fire using a paper fuse. Johnson stated that he did not know Morris, Klebold, or Harris that well, but Morris seemed to be the leader. Johnson stated that Harris and Klebold seemed to be ignorant about firearms and bombs.

Johnson ran into the former owner Bob Kirgis in a bar, after the Columbine incident. Kirgis had told him Harris seemed to be getting into drugs. Johnson stated that he had seen cocaine and marijuana at the Pizza store, while he had been working there. He also said Kirgis told him that Harris and Klebold had set off a pipe bomb at the store. Johnson stated that he never heard Harris or Klebold make any threats. Nor did he see them with firearms, bombs, or drugs. He only saw and knew they liked to play with fireworks.

Monopolies Are,"The industry-funded “Center for Environment & Welfare” just spent six figures on [foodpricefix.com](http://foodpricefix.com/), a glossy campaign begging Congress to torpedo California’s Prop 12.Right... because humane standards are to blame for record-high egg and pork prices. Here’s what the receipts say:

* **Economists peg the Prop 12 price bump at roughly $10 a year.** That’s coffee-money next to corporate mark-ups.
* **Cal-Main doubled its profits during the 2024-25 egg surge and is now under DOJ scrutiny.** Price-fixing, not cage sizes, padded that margin.
* **Canada’s family-farm model kept egg prices steady** while U.S. shelves hit $6.23/dozen. The difference? Market power, not animal-welfare rules.

CEW’s real play is to keep four pork giants monopolizing the market ... and to ensure consumers blind to the math.

Not on our watch.

My wife and I are both 30. We’ve managed to scrape together a net worth of about $530K, not counting our two extremely humble “vehicles” (one of which is technically held together with zip ties and faith) and some miscellaneous assets like a really nice shovel and enough mason jars to survive a minor apocalypse.

Here’s the financial rundown:
	•	$270K in investments
	•	$30K in cash (emergency fund or spontaneous goat sanctuary fund, TBD)
	•	$230K in home equity
	•	$130K left on the mortgage
	•	$900/mo total mortgage payment (taxes, insurance, everything)
	•	No kids
	•	No car payments
	•	No debt
	•	We basically live on vibes and kale.

We garden like it’s the Dust Bowl, drive cars that would get bullied by a 10-speed bike, and live on about half of one of our incomes (combined income: ~$230K/yr). Everything else goes into investments.

The Plan:
Hit $1.25M in assets in the next 5–10 years, then peace out of full-time work and downgrade our labor to something like 20 hrs/week at a coffee shop, hardware store, and avoid spreadsheets. Just enough income to cover groceries, health insurance, and the occasional impulse kayak.

My question to the internet hive mind:
How many of you have successfully escaped the 40–50 hr/week life?
Like, actually did it. Not “I plan to in 2027 if Tesla hits $5000/share,” but real humans who no longer wake up to Outlook calendar invites and mandatory HR trainings.

Is it everything you hoped? Do you feel free, or just broke and slightly less stressed?

Also: Do you regret anything? Should I stop investing and just buy a goat farm now?
