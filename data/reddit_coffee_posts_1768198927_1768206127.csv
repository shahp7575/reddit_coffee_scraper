1qap7uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qap7uk/coworker_keeps_farting_on_us/,Coworker keeps farting on us.,"I want to start off by saying that the title isn’t me being dramatic. I want advice on what to do because it’s such a ridiculous thing. And I , like many others, don’t like when someone won’t stop farting around them. Especially when we work so close together.

I work at a coffee shop inside a large clinic and we’ve had a couple of new hires. One of the new girls, who I’ll call Jenn, has some stomach issues. I think she had mentioned it was IBS? So she has to run to the bathroom a couple more times than what’s considered normal and she’ll take like 10+ minutes each time. It’s fine and it’s out of her control.

I have no issues with bathroom breaks, like I don’t see it as a concern because of her health issues. But all my coworkers started to notice a smell. At first we all thought it was homeless people coming in to get water because sometimes they do come in and sometimes there’s a homeless person smell. Which whatever they deserve water and medical attention too. But it’s constant and we all put our barista heads together and concluded it was coming from her.

She would just let it rip where she stood. Silent and very deadly. Look I get it it’s embarrassing and if it happens once I would assume it’s an accident and move on with my day. But it’s so often. I’ll be there standing next to her wiping a counter or training her in new drinks and the most horrid smell will just fill the store. Or someone will be walking behind her and just have to immediately turn around to go somewhere else. 

It’s gross, and it’s rude in my opinion. I wanted her to stop but wasn’t sure how to just tell her and I didn’t really want to have an awkward convo with someone I just met. So I told my manager. The only thing that came out of that was her trying to figure out how many bathroom breaks she’s allowed to have. I tried to explain that I don’t care how many times she shits on company time I care about my nostrils not being assaulted because she can’t be bothered to find a corner to stink up away from the rest of us.

I don’t know what to do, all my coworkers are at a loss too. Especially because she doesn’t care. Maybe she doesn’t notice but everyone else does because it smells foul. And it reached a point where it’s not funny and it’s kind of affecting the work place. Should I just outright tell her it’s gross? I don’t think it’ll come out in a nice way if I do and I don’t want to be accused of creating a hostile work environment or anything. Should I just try to drop more hints or be passive aggressive??? Idk. Any advice is appreciated.

TLDR:Coworker keeps letting out massive farts around everyone without a care and I’m tired of smelling it and I’m tired of it sticking to my clothes. Boss won’t do anything so what should I do?",1,1768205222.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1qap4vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/rSocialskillsAscend/comments/1qap4vt/how_to_be_the_person_people_text_their_friends/,How to Be the Person People TEXT Their Friends About: The Psychology Behind Private Recommendations,"Spent way too much time analyzing why some people get privately recommended while others just collect LinkedIn endorsements nobody reads. Talked to mentors, colleagues, read behavioral psych research, listened to podcasts about influence and reputation. Realized most advice focuses on surface level networking BS when the real magic happens in private conversations.



Here's the thing: society rewards loud self-promotion and personal branding theater. We're conditioned to think visibility equals value. But the most respected people I know barely post on social media. They're the ones whose names come up in ""who should I hire"" or ""who do you trust"" texts. That's the currency that actually matters.



The gap between public reputation and private recommendation is wild. You can have 10k followers and zero people vouching for you when it counts. Or you can be relatively unknown but have a small circle of people who'd go to bat for you without hesitation. Guess which one leads to better opportunities, relationships, and quality of life?



 what actually makes people recommend you privately



Become the person who solves problems without making it a production. The research on reciprocity from Robert Cialdini's ""Influence"" shows people remember helpful actions way more than they remember credentials. When someone asks for advice, actually help them instead of networking at them. No ""let's circle back"" corporate speak. No ""pick your brain"" coffee meetings that waste everyone's time. Just solve their actual problem if you can.



Noticed the people who get recommended most are the ones who helped without expecting anything back. They forwarded a job posting. Introduced two people who should know each other. Gave honest feedback that actually improved something. Small stuff that compounds over years.



Be someone people feel safe being honest around. This one's massive. Read ""The Culture Code"" by Daniel Coyle, won a bunch of awards, dude studied high performing teams for years. The book breaks down psychological safety and why some groups thrive while others implode. Main insight: people remember who made them feel stupid versus who made them feel heard.



Stop trying to be the smartest person in every conversation. Admit when you don't know something. Ask questions that aren't just waiting for your turn to talk. The person who says ""i haven't thought about that, tell me more"" gets way more respect than the person who needs to one up every story.



Follow through on boring commitments. Here's something nobody wants to hear: being reliable is unsexy but it's literally the foundation of private recommendations. If you say you'll send something, send it. If you commit to a timeline, hit it. If you can't, communicate early not late.



This sounds obvious but most people are terrible at it. They overcommit, underdeliver, then wonder why opportunities dry up. Started using the Finch app to build consistency habits and it helped with realizing how often small commitments were getting dropped. Gamified habit tracking sounds dumb but it works for building that follow through muscle.



Be genuinely interested in what other people are building. Not networking interested. Actually interested. Read their work. Remember details about their projects. Check in months later about something they mentioned once.



There's this concept from Keith Ferrazzi's ""Never Eat Alone"" about being a connector versus a collector. Collectors rack up contacts. Connectors actually care about people's success independent of what they can extract. Guess which one gets recommended in private group chats?



Develop taste and share it generously. People remember who introduced them to something that mattered. A book that changed their perspective. A tool that solved an annoying problem. A framework that clarified their thinking.



For anyone serious about continuous learning, BeFreed is an AI-powered personalized learning app worth checking out. Built by a team from Columbia University, it pulls from high quality sources like research papers, expert interviews, and books to generate custom audio podcasts based on what you actually want to learn. 



You can type in any skill or goal, like improving communication or understanding behavioral psychology, and it creates a tailored learning plan with episodes you can customize from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The depth control is clutch when time's tight but you still want to absorb useful frameworks. Plus there's a virtual coach called Freedia that you can talk to mid-episode if something clicks and you want to explore it further. Cuts through the noise of generic content and focuses on what matters for your specific growth areas.



Started using Ash for relationship coaching insights and it completely reframed how conflict gets handled. Now when friends ask about communication advice, there's something actually useful to point them to instead of just saying ""communicate better"" like an idiot. Sharing specific resources makes you valuable in people's minds.



Be the same person in different contexts. Consistency across environments is rare and people notice it. The version of you in client meetings should roughly match the version in casual settings. Not saying be unprofessional, but if you're wildly different depending on who's watching, people sense it and don't trust you.



Listened to a Patrick O'Shaughnessy podcast interview with David Senra who reads biographies obsessively. One pattern across successful people: they had clear values that didn't shift based on convenience. Sounds simple but watch how many people completely change their personality depending on who they're trying to impress.



Get uncomfortably good at something specific. Generalists are forgettable. The person who's genuinely exceptional at one thing gets recommended because they're the obvious answer when that need comes up. Doesn't have to be your job, can be a skill or knowledge area.



This doesn't mean become one dimensional. But it means being known for something specific. ""She's the best at x"" beats ""he's pretty good at several things"" every time in recommendation calculus.



Handle failure and conflict with grace. Everyone screws up. Not everyone handles it well. The people who get privately recommended are the ones who own mistakes fast, fix them without drama, and don't make excuses.



Same with disagreements. You can push back, have strong opinions, advocate for your position. But the moment you make it personal or petty, you're done in people's private recommendations. They'll work with you professionally but they won't vouch for you privately.



Actually celebrate other people's wins without making it about you.  Genuine happiness for others is shockingly rare. Most congratulations feel performative or have a hint of comparison. The people who authentically get excited about your success without centering themselves are the ones you want to recommend to others.



Started noticing this pattern: the people recommended most are the ones who remembered small wins. Sent a quick text when something good happened. Didn't need credit or visibility for supporting others. That builds the kind of loyalty that translates to private recommendations.



Private recommendations are the real social currency. They open doors that public profiles can't. They create opportunities that never get posted. They build a reputation that's actually earned not performed.



Focus on being the person people trust enough to stake their own reputation on. Everything else is just noise.",1,1768204905.0,rSocialskillsAscend,0,1.0,False
1qap4n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessPH/comments/1qap4n4/need_advice_from_my_fellow_small_business_orders/,Need advice from my fellow small business orders,"Hi Reddit peeps, newbie here and I know safe mag kwento and rant dito and sana no bashing. 😅 Long post ahead and pagpasensyahan nyo napo if medyo magulo ang magiging pagkkwento ko hehe. Pero any advice po is sobra po namin ma appreciate. 

Context: Me and my partner has 2 branches here sa province, it’s a coffee shop. 1st branch since 2021 pa (this is located near University) then yung 2nd branch last 2024 naipatayo (town proper). Each branch nag aassign kami ng 2 staff each.

Hindi na biro yung stress na nararanasan namin palagi sa current employees namin. Palagi nalang may biglang aabsent, hindi makakapasok, hindi sumusunod sa schedule, biglang may mag uundertime, mag cacash advance, babale, mamimili ng day off and mga ayaw mag overtime kahit alam nilang marami pang customer. 
It’s been a cycle and nakakapagod na talaga silang intindihin palagi. Tho’ sa quality of work wala kami masasabi dahil magagalimg talaga sila, sa timpla luto ok sila.

We have a total of 5 employees. Yung 1, itago natin sa pangalan na si Miss Sup, mag ttwo years na sya samin this May 2026 and currently under training for Supervisory position since June last year and ang position nya before is head cook. Pero si Miss Sup is may other work which is nag sasideline sa Gov’t pag day off nya samin. Supposed to be 6 months training lang dapat yung for Supervisory position pero mukhang need namin iextend. Kasama din sa training nya na need nya mag cover pag may absent na employee

Yung other 2 employees, 2 senior Barista, sila si B1 and B2, (mag 2 years na this July)
then yung other 2 employees, si B3, (working student) barista and cook to (mag 7 months na this January) eto si B3, medyo weakling to, and madalas marami syang error. Mapa timpla at luto may palpak palagi. Kinausap na namin sya before regarding her performance, mag titino ng mga 1 or 2 weeks then balik na naman sa dati na bara-bara ang trabaho. We’re planning to eliminate her soon. 

and B4, (barista) mag 2 months palang new hire last November. So far ok naman sya.

Ang recurring problem namin ganito:

1st branch: Ang inaassign namin dto palagi is si B2 and B3. Madalas absent si B3 gawa ng school works daw, or kaya may family occasion palagi, and Mon Tue yung pasok nya sa school) which is Monday peak day namin sa branch. Tapos si B2 naman na Senior Barista medyo sakitin, hindi napapasukan yung naiplot namin na schedule. Ang ending, nagsasara nalang si Branch 1 since walang tatao. Hindi kami makatao sa shop ng partner ko dahil sobrang busy kami sa commissary and pagpunta sa mga suppliers and pagreready ng stocks. 

2nd branch: Dito naka assign si Miss Sup and B1 (senior barista) dito din madalas si B4 pag wala si b1. Ang problem namin. Si B1 sakitin rin, kalagitnaan ng shift tatawag samin “ mag undertime po ako, hindi ko napo kaya, masakit po ganto ko ganyan “ ang ending, maiiwan mag isa yung kasama nya. Medyo pala absent din to si B1, and madalas magrequest ng preferred day off na lagi namin napagbibigyan before. Si Miss Sup naman, hindi namin maasahan mag cover or pumasok pag may absent na staff dahil nagwowork din nga sya sa Government. We always feel na hindi nya priority ang pagpasok sa cafe namin.

Ngayon, medyo bad day talaga to. Ang naka assign pumasok dapat is total of 4 which are:

1st branch: B2 and B3
2nd branch: B1 and B4
Miss Sup: day off

Ang present lang is si B4 sa branch 2. sabay sabay absent si b1 b2 and b3. May sakit yung 2 tapos may schoolworks daw yung 1. Nagsara si Branch 1 (lugi na naman kame dahil sarado)

Si Miss Sup naman, di daw makakapagcover kase busy kay Government. Kami ng partner ko currently may trangkaso, pero ang ending bumangon ako at kumilos para samahan si B4. Dahil hindi ko na kakayanin pati branch 2 magsara.

I cannot, I just can’t let this happen againanymore. OA na kung OA pero feeling ko mamamatay ata kami ng maaga sa stress. We are not complaining, we chose this path na magtayo ng 2 branches and we’re thankful for that. It’s just that, hindi na namin alam ang tamang gawin sa mga ganitong klaseng empleyado. This has been an ongoing cycle since last year. Kahit ilang beses sila kausapin, kahit ilang beses kami mag meeting, parang hindi talaga namin sila mapasunod. We tried kausapin sila ng mahinahon at nakita narin nila paano kami magalit, still parang walang epekto.

What else can we do aside from hiring and training new staff? Please help us and give us proper advice. And gusto sana namin lumawak pa ang business, mag focus sana kami sa marketing, r&d, etc pero di namin magawa kasi naiinvolve parin kami sa operations. Wala naman kaso na tumao paminsan sa mga tindahan namin, pero marami kaming backoffice works na nasasagasaan. Ultimo mental and physical health  namin nasisira na. 😭

Maraming salamat po sa mag aadvice at sa matyagang magbabasa. 🥹",1,1768204886.0,BusinessPH,2,1.0,False
1qap3vo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qap3vo/hr_the_door_under_the_roots/,[HR] The Door Under the Roots,"I found a door under the roots of a tree I've passed a hundred times. It sat perfectly flush with the packed dirt around it. I could not tell if it had been put there from above or was being regurgitated from below. 

With little thought, I pulled the handle and the hinges swung like they were just oiled, not a sound other than my own efforts. Under it was a set of steps dug right into the earth. They looked dry and sturdy.  It smelled less damp and stale down there than the forest I stood in.  Instead, the hallway felt slightly …electric. It was narrow and there was a dim light that flickered differently than torches would. I imagine, I had never been anywhere lit by torch light alone.

I paused at the threshold. This feeling. It reminded me when someone dares you to do something stupid, that moment just before your tongue touches the battery. The metallic taste is somehow already in your mouth. But turning back seemed crazier than going forward, so I swung the door entirely open and stepped down.
At the bottom of the eight or so steps, the hallway narrowed and curved and a light source was coming from further on. It would only take a few steps down the hallway before my entrance, and the only known exit would be out of sight. I stepped closer to the first bend, wanting to see the source of the light, but it seemed to be matching my pace, staying around each next bend.. I shimmied slowly, and stopped multiple times to quickly bound back towards the steps.

 It bent and bent, now almost curling on it itself. I turned, suddenly realizing I went too far. I sprinted back to the stairs to find the earth finished regurgitating the door. Nothing but solid dirt remained. I was not surprised, but I was beginning to sweat against the cool air. 

The light down the hall got twice as bright. The dirt walls gradually changed to wallpaper. Floral. Faded. Peeling. Patchy the first few feet, and slowly the dirt became rare, until the glowing floral pattern completely took over. Like ivy completely covering a brick wall. 

After a short straight away, the hallway continued to bend right and left angles. Corners that pinched like toy box hinges. And every few feet, doors. Too many. Some were half-sized, for small children or large raccoons. Others were oblong or obtuse, short barn style doors, complete with barn smells wafting underneath. 

That was my reality, opening random doors in Wonderland.  I looked for one that gave the least amount of creepy vibes. Many were too small, one doorknob glowed red hot, and as I got near, I could feel heat. Another was completely covered by a mirror. It took me a beat to realize my reflection had no head.

Eventually, I came to the most offensive door. Inside was a room full of coat racks. Every coat was dripping wet, but the floor was bone dry. I took a full step in, but kept my hand in the door jam. With my other hand I turned one around, it was a person, hollowed flat, hung up like laundry. Their faces sagged but their eyes, with more depth than their skulls, moved. Blinked. Silently begged for help. 

I said “sorry” like that, fixed anything, and shut the door.

I was relieved to be back in the safety of the neverending hallway I’d probably die in. Humans are quick to move the goalposts.

I picked another door, because bad things happen in threes. This one opened to what looked like the diner downtown. Same booths, same greasy laminated menus. But the “people” eating there were all… wrong. Like someone had described humans to an alien, and that alien did their best. Slightly Picassoesque faces stated et me with unsymmetrical eyes, looked at me over menus they gripped too hard with far too many fingers. Still chewing, slurping, sipping coffee that was the wrong color. It had no color.

The waitress turned and smiled at me with teeth that went back too far. She said, “Table for one?”
And I swear, I nodded just to avoid being rude .

That’s when I realized the door behind me was gone.
All the doors were gone. Just endless booths, endless chewing. Why did they have so many fucking fingers. 

The forest had spit me out somewhere else. Or maybe it swallowed me whole.

Either way, I’m not lost. I’m seated.
And the waitress is bringing me pie.

She slid the plate across the table. Pie. Cherry. But too red, and it smelled like pennies and… bleach? 

“On the house,” she said.
Her voice was kind. Too kind. Funeral-home kind.

I picked up the fork because not doing so felt like insulting her, and it was obvious you don’t want to piss off the help in a place like this.

The first bite burned. Not hot—cold. My tongue bordered on frostbite. My teeth ached, my jaw hummed. The “cherry” wasn't a cherry at all. It was meat. Like those cubes chunks in a can of Campbell's. I wish this was a can of Campbell's soup

I smiled. “Delicious.”
She nodded, far too satisfied, and walked away.

That’s when I noticed the pie looked untouched . Every forkful I took, it refilled. Whole again. 

The booths around me started watching. Not with their eyes—most didn’t have eyes that worked right—but with the subtle lean, the twitch of a jaw, the faint scrape of chairs turning. Like a hundred mannequins holding their breath, waiting to see what I’d do next.

I tried standing. My legs didn’t move. Not frozen, not restrained. Just politely refusing. Like they’d decided to sit, and my brain was in no position to argue. 

The ceiling lights flickered. One of them buzzed, then dripped. Not water—something thicker. The drop hit the table and crawled toward the pie like a slug late for work.

I whispered, “I want to go home.”

And the whole diner answered, in perfect harmony, “Then finish your slice.”

The fork was back in my hand. My fingers clenched it without asking me first. The pie pulsed. The red filling bubbled once. Like a wink. Even the pie was in on it. 

So I did the only logical thing. I stabbed the fork down, straight through the crust. The whole diner flinched at once—every patron jerking in unison, like I’d just hit the fire alarm inside their veins.

The lights cut out.
Silence.

When they flicked back on, I wasn’t at the table anymore. I was standing in the hallway again. The floral wallpaper looked to have taken on a slightly red hue.

The plate was still in my hand.
Empty. Clean. Like I’d licked it spotless.

I dropped it. I did not hear it hit the ground.

My brain said run. But, don’t run on an Escher staircase. No one has the cardio for that. 

And plus, they want you to run. I still did not know who “they” were, or why they wanted you to run, but I assumed it made us taste better, 

So I walked, the hairs on the back of my neck reaching straight out behind me. Doors lining both sides, all of them humming with something alive behind them. One door shook like it was laughing. A few doors down, one oozed a blue fluid that I carefully stepped over.  One smelled like Axe body spray, and that one made me the most nervous.

Finally, I saw it: a door with a glowing EXIT sign above it. Classic trap. 

I pushed it open.

Inside was… my living room. Couch. Coffee table. The ugly lamp I keep meaning to throw out. The TV was on, showing a rerun of a show I've been watching. 

It was too perfect. . 

I stepped in anyway, mostly because I had not seen this episode yet. 

The door slammed behind me, and the laughter track from the TV got louder. Then it wasn’t a laugh track—it was the forest. Thousands of voices, leaves and branches cackling in sync. .

The TV characters turned to me, dead eyes bright, and said, “Welcome home.”

Why does everyone here have perfect pitch? 

I bolted. Straight back through the door. Straight back into the hallway. The wallpaper was peeling faster now, flaking off like skin after a sunburn. The whole place groaned like it was tired of hosting me.

And then—mercifully, stupidly—there it was. Another door. Small, crooked, glowing faintly like a night-light.

I opened it, and the forest spat me out. Fresh air. Trees. Moonlight.

I fell to my knees in the dirt, gasping. The forest was quiet. No whispers. No chewing. Just crickets and owls doing their normal night-shift.

I looked back. The door with the brass handle was gone. Just roots now. Tangled, ordinary. .

I staggered up, muttering, “Out of the woods.”

I would have written it all off as a dream, or I hit my head and was just coming to.  But the taste in my mouth was still sweet. Still cold. Still cherry pie.
And when I touched my stomach, it pulsed.

Like something inside me was waiting for the next course.",1,1768204819.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

i study on the dining room table which is open next to our living room basically its in the middle of the house so like eveyrone sees me studying, i wake up at 9-10 am everyday and keep studying till 10-11pm i literally dont get up from studying except for the bathroom or to make coffee, ive stopped hanging out with friends, ive deleted all social media from my phone, im doing everything humanly possible to get a good grade on this test and im doing all this infront of my mom she knows how much i study and how much im sacraficing.

yet for some reason she still doesnt believe i study, she vents to everyone about how i dont study, her friends, our relatives abroad, my aunts, my grandma, my siblings abroad, literally every person she sees she vents to them lies. she wants to have something, anything in her life to complain about.

if she sees me not in my study place for a few minutes she starts yelling at me telling me i have no future im gonna end up a maid bc i ""dont study"" that im gonna fail and shit, idfk what more she says i just put my airpods in tbh but she says alot alot.

im starting to resent her. she doesnt see my efforts even though theyre right infront of her face, if i literally sat in her lap and studied she still wouldnt believe im studying, why? wtf more can i do? she also never forgets to remind me that im stupid and slow and have no future. idfk if shes rage baiting me and she thinks this is toxic motivation or some shit or shes actually just stupid and blind and doesnt see me studying right infront of her ass.

everytime i try to talk to her about this it turns to just yelling and she never hears shit im saying, i need to fucking die with books up my ass so she believes im studying, actually no she still wouldnt believe it.

 - How do you order a hot chocolate and instead get a steeped tea five days in a row? Is there a glitch in your part of the simulation?
 - Someone posted a bagel buttered on the OUTSIDE and then folded inside-out like a f**ing northern Saskatchewan road trip map from the 80s. Did you personally offend the baker? Did you kick their cat?
 - There was a literal piece of machinery from the drink machine in someone’s coffee. Breakfast? Bro you were given a side quest to find the tin man his brain.
- And that lady who got a used diabetic test strip in her box of Timbits? That’s not a ""wrong order,"" that’s a biological declaration of war.

All the images are collected by the KSampler and forwarded to the XYZ-GridPlot. It follows the ComfyUI paradigm and is guaranteed to be compatible with any KSampler setup and is completely customizable to any use-case. No weird custom samplers or node black magic required!

You can even build super-grids by simply connecting two XYZ-GridPlot nodes together and the image order and shape is determined by the linked labels and order + output\_is\_list option. This allows any grid type imaginable. All the values are provided by combinations of OutputLists, which can be generated from multiline texts, number ranges, JSON selectors and even Spreadsheet files. Or just hook them up with combo inputs using the inspect\_combo feature for sampler/scheduler comparisons.

It put me back by Rs970(70rs for speed-post) and looking at how it reached me in 3 days, i’d say the speed-post wasn’t a scam🤓….they shipped it via ship rocket which has my trust.

What surprised me was that they personally called me to customise the order and customise they did….by asking what equipment i use and what level of roast i usually enjoyed and would i be open to experimenting with new flavours and i loved that about them. Maybe because it’s been only three months since i started my journey but that instantly made me trust them( although they took my advice as though i know what im doing lol 😂) 

There were no lies but straight truths from them when i asked about their light roasts as someone who didn’t taste it even once…..he straight up said that there would be sourness with light roasts unlike the other ones where bitterness dominates them so he just gave a heads up to prepare my palate and i liked the honesty 

Here’s my order: 4 Light roasts,1 medium,1 medium-dark

Ik the rant was long and thank you if you’ve reached till here…..I didn’t open the packs yet since they’re resting but I’m confused about the duration of resting them so can you please help me out 🙏🙏

I’ve yet to see their roast consistency and the taste so expect some more posts from me once they’ve rested enough

All my life I have been dealing with the question of everything.  After many years, I have come to the perfect theory that connects everyone and explains many hidden things.
I would love to share with you. And hear your opinion.
I will start with one sentence.
The soul within us is not ours. It is a particle of God who sits within us, hears our thoughts, even all our actions, and guides us to our destiny. God told Abraham our father to multiply, so his seed would be like the stars in the sky and the sand on the earth's surface.
And what I am trying to say is that every person is a star that exists and influences according to the butterfly effect. And God directs all the stars. That's why in Genesis it is written that God created the heavens and the earth on the first day. This means that God created the heavens above the heavens, which is the space and the stars around the earth, so that the earth could exist, because without what is around it, the earth would not be able to stand on its own.
Then the tree of life, which is the first root in the earth, which is God's firstborn son and is the basis for everything else, because everything was gas. Then the first forest with tall trees whose job was to absorb the gas that fertilized the earth. From here it is understood that the first forest was Israel, which is the size of a small forest of trees, and that is why in God's eyes it will remain because they are the first forest that gave its life for the earth, which absorbed all the gas from the earth. Then the dinosaurs, whose job was to sow seeds and create more plants by destroying and mixing pollen from every existing plant in order to create new ones and fertilize the earth.
And every grain of sand is a lifeless star, but a person is a star that develops somewhere in the cosmos. Every person grows in our world and the star that exists on it grows with it and develops. But the chosen one in every generation, like Abraham, David, Solomon, Buddha, Jesus, and many others in history, influences this planet, and the God particle within us guides everyone. In man, there is a spirit and a soul. In plants and animals, there is a spirit and a soul. Souls from all over the cosmos come to our planet to excavate for their deeds. They reincarnate in plants and animals. And the souls serve in this world both to develop the planet that exists on them and also to benefit the souls that come to excavate for their deeds. Example: A rooster that a person eats and it tastes good or nourishes and satisfies that soul. In a rooster, his sins are excavated by the pleasure that the soul felt within us. And so everything, tea, coffee, even water, symbolizes the number of souls in the cosmos.

“Maybe I should just give up. It seems like this site is never going to take off…” he said with a bitter smile, sipping his coffee.

“Let me take a look; perhaps it can still be saved.” In my view, this situation might have nothing to do with the content, the product, or even the domain name.

After taking over, I didn’t change the product, switch the domain, or run any ads. I focused on doing just one thing: **rebuilding the underlying logic of search traffic.**

Three months later, the Google Search Console data showed: **3.75 million impressions, 151,000 clicks, and an average ranking of 7.5.**

[How a Website Achieved 3.5 Million Impressions and 151K Clicks in 3 Months: A Practical Review](https://preview.redd.it/a6myp54mevcg1.jpg?width=2298&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63f9601f17dea4a82e6bea9e5dbb4c79babeb381)

Today, I am sharing the complete review and a replicable process. If you are struggling with whether to abandon your small site, give this a try — it might just be the lifeline you need.

# Part One: Keyword System Construction (The Starting Point for Everything)

❌ Most people fail at SEO not because their content is poor. ❌ But because the keywords they choose from the start are\*\*”destined not to rank.”\*\*

**Core Principle (Mindset First)**

The goal is not to “find keywords,” but to **“build a keyword system.”**

A healthy keyword system must simultaneously satisfy the following:

* Keywords for **rapid initial volume** (quick wins).
* Keywords for **mid-term scaling** (traffic amplification).
* Keywords for **long-term traffic dividends** (market dominance).

**Step 1: Start with the “Demand Pool,” Not the Tool**

Before touching any tool, I do one thing: List the**five categories of questions** that users genuinely search for:

* **What is/How does** (Informational: What is / How does)
* **How to** (Informational/Navigational: How to)
* **Comparison** (Commercial Investigation: X vs Y / Best X)
* **Problem/Solution** (Informational/Transactional: Why / Fix / Error)
* **Decision-Making** (Transactional: Pricing / Alternative / Review)

This step determines whether you unearth **“keywords with click value”** or **“keywords no one clicks on.”**

**Step 2: Bulk Keyword Mining (Don’t Rely on Just One Tool)**

**Method 1: Google Keyword Planner (Free, Quick-Volume Generator)**

Specific Process:

Open Google Keyword Planner ([ads.google.com](http://ads.google.com/) → Tools → Keyword Planner).

Input **action-oriented core terms**.

❌ **Avoid** generic terms like ecommerce.

✅ **Use** terms like build online store / start ecommerce website.

Export all keywords.

*Why avoid generic terms?* Because the data Google provides for generic terms is from an “advertising perspective,” which is often irrelevant for SEO.

**Method 2: Google Suggest + People Also Ask (Often Overlooked)**

This is my key method for filling in long-tail keywords:

Search the main keyword on Google.

Record:

* **Auto-complete (Suggest):** I recommend a tool like [https://keywordtool.io/](https://keywordtool.io/) to generate a large number of related search suggestions from various platforms’ auto-complete data.
* **People Also Ask (PAA)**
* **Related Searches** at the bottom of the page.

These keywords share a common trait: **They have been searched by real users, and the search intent is highly explicit.**

**Method 3: Competitor Keyword Reverse Engineering (Highest Efficiency)**

Use Semrush → Input competitor domain.

Go to Organic Keywords → Filter by:

* Position **6–20**
* Search Volume **≥ 100**

What do these keywords indicate? They show that\*\*”Google has already recognized this content structure, but the ‘optimal solution’ has not yet been achieved.”\*\* This is your opportunity.

**Method 4: Semrush Keyword Magic Tool**

This is a highly efficient method for bulk generation, classification, and filtering of keywords:

* Open Semrush → Keyword Magic Tool.
* Input core term (action-oriented or demand-oriented).

Classify by intent or topic:

* **Informational** (Information-seeking)
* **Commercial** (Commercial investigation)
* **Transactional** (Ready to buy/act)

Set filters for Search Volume and Keyword Difficulty (KD):

* Search Volume **≥ 100**
* KD **≤ 40** (Easier to rank initially)

**Step 3: Keyword Screening Criteria (Don’t Just Look at Search Volume)**

Many people fail at SEO by only screening keywords based on search volume. My method is the **Four-Dimensional Screening Method**, where each dimension has specific operational standards.

[Keyword Screening Criteria](https://preview.redd.it/2a41sweyevcg1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=3da216d962f191c675f443fb9e896012797561a5)

**Practical Tip for SERP Analysis:**

Search using **incognito mode** to avoid personalized results.

Tally the proportion of result types in the top 10.

Note the title, description, and URL types to determine if your content has an entry point.

If the top 10 results are all large e-commerce sites or high-authority brands, it indicates difficulty in ranking quickly. Place these keywords in the mid-to-long-term observation list.

**Step 4: Keyword Layering (The “Crucial Point”)**

**KD 15–25 (Month 1):** **Rapid ranking** → Send positive signals to Google.

**KD 25–35 (Month 2):** **Amplify traffic** → Establish topical authority.

**KD 35–45 (Month 3):** **Compete for industry terms** → Capture scale dividends.

The sequence is critical. If you mix up the order, a new site can easily **“fail to break through.”**

**Final Deliverable:** An Excel spreadsheet with fields including:

* Keyword
* Search Volume
* KD
* Intent
* Corresponding Page Type

# Part Two: Competitor Analysis (Not Copying, but “Finding Flaws”)

The core goal of competitor analysis is to **find areas that they have already validated but haven’t executed perfectly**, and then precisely target those gaps.

**Step 1: Selecting the Right Competitors (Where 90% of People Go Wrong)**

❌ **Do not** choose industry giants.

✅**Choose** sites with a similar Domain Authority (DA) **and** existing organic traffic.

**Standard Operating Procedure:**

* **Tool Selection:** Semrush / Ahrefs / Moz.

**Candidate Selection:**

* DA is within **±10** of yours.
* Ranking for **≥ 1,000** keywords.
* Traffic source aligns with your target market.

**Data Validation:** Check their homepage/blog/product page traffic and confirm that their ranking keywords cover your planned core topics.

**Final Screening:** Select **3–5** competitors for in-depth analysis.

**Step 2: Deconstruct Content Structure, Not Just Word Count**

**Goal:** Be **“more useful”** than them, not just longer.

**Operational Process:**

* Open the top 10 competitor pages for your target keyword.

**Deconstruct the content structure:**

* H1/H2/H3 hierarchy.
* Paragraph length, formatting, images, tables, diagrams.
* CTAs, downloadable resources, FAQs, case studies

**Step 3: Finding “Overcomable Points”**

**Formula:** Opportunity = They are already ranking + Their content is not maximized

**Operational Steps:**

**Identify Potential Keywords:**

Ranking **3–5** → Low competitive pressure, significant traffic potential.

Ranking **6–10** → Potential for a quick flip/takeover.

**Compare Content Coverage:**

* Do they have VS / Comparison content?
* Are they missing localization, scenario-specific, or niche audience content?
* Are they lacking in-depth information, charts, case studies, or operational guides?

**List Optimization Solutions:**

* Add comparison tables / FAQs / case studies.
* Scenario-specific examples: localization, industry/audience customization.
* Downloadable resources or interactive tools to enhance user experience.

**Prioritize:**

* Traffic Potential × Ease of Improvement = Priority

**Step 4: Backlink Analysis → Determining Where to Get Exposure (Semrush Practical Guide)**

**Goal:** Not to blindly build backlinks, but to find high-value sources that competitors have already leveraged, which you can emulate or optimize.

https://preview.redd.it/2wzs8m31fvcg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ba5b1bf7ef183acdd8b62342b11e051159847c3



**Operational Process:**

* Open Semrush → SEO → **Backlink Gap**.
* Input your domain (**You**).
* Input **1–3** competitor domains.
* Click “Find Prospects.”

**Analyze Results:**

The page will display three types of backlinks: i. Links that**both you and competitors have**→ Reference content format or relationship building. ii. Links that**only competitors have**→ This is your potential opportunity. iii. Links that**only you have** → Consolidate your advantage and increase authority.

**Filter High-Value Links:**

* Focus on sources with high DA/traffic and strong relevance.
* Exclude low-quality or spam links.
* Mark as “Priority Targets” for outreach.

**Develop an Exposure Strategy:**

For high-value resource pages, industry blogs, and news media:

▪ Submit content collaboration / guest posts.

▪ Offer quotable resources or tools.

For social media or forums covered by competitors but not by you:

▪ Join topic discussions.

▪ Provide unique insights or case studies.

# Part Three: Content Creation

The essence of SEO is not just writing articles; it is **“occupying a topic” with content.**

**1. Topic Cluster Construction**

**Goal:** Occupy the entire topic and establish authority.

* List the **Core Topic Terms** (3–5 most important ones).
* Use Keyword Planner / Ahrefs / SEMrush / ChatGPT to expand related **long-tail keywords**.

**Classify by Search Intent:**

* Informational (How to / What is / Guide)
* Comparative (vs / Best / Top)
* Transactional (Buy / Price / Cost)

**Generate a directory tree for each core term:**

**Pillar Page** = Overview + Table of Contents.

**Supporting Pages** = One article for each sub-topic.

**Internal Linking Strategy:** Supporting pages link to the Pillar Page, and the Pillar Page links to supporting pages + mutual cross-linking.

**Tools:** Ahrefs / SEMrush / SurferSEO / Excel for directory tree mapping.

**2. Page Role Positioning**

**Goal:** Ensure every page knows its “identity” to increase search engine crawl weight.

[Page Role Positioning](https://preview.redd.it/b50skao2fvcg1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d00fe93c937796d2384a078f786b4abad424ac4)

**3. AI-Assisted Content Creation**

**Goal:** Efficiently generate structured content while retaining human judgment.

**Outline Generation:**

**Prompt:** Generate an article structure covering What / Why / How / Compare / Mistakes / FAQ.

**Content Filling:**

* AI generates the first draft.
* Human supplements with exclusive data, case studies, and experience summaries.
* Verify logic, SEO keyword coverage, and formatting.

**Supplementing Missing Questions:**

Use PAA / Related Searches / Reddit / Quora / Zhihu (Chinese Q&A platform).

Add new FAQs or sub-topic pages.

**Tools:** ChatGPT / Claude / Perplexity + Ahrefs PAA / SurferSEO.

**4. Post-Publication Secondary Engineering**

**Goal:** Increase traffic by optimizing existing content rather than just writing new content.

[Increase traffic by optimizing existing content rather than just writing new content](https://preview.redd.it/py3tpl75fvcg1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9839440a685b1c2a83f7e21582b3f40aad7668d)

**Supplementary Tips:**

* Use GA / GSC / Heatmaps to monitor performance.
* High CTR → Retain; Low CTR → Adjust title and meta description.
* Ranking in the top 3 → Expand supporting pages to form a thematic closed loop.

# Part Four: Link Building (The Accelerator, Not the Foundation)

**Conclusion first:** More backlinks are not necessarily better. The key is to provide them **“to the right page at the right stage.”**

I break down backlinks into **4 types + clear purposes**, executed in sequence.

**I. Overall Backlink Strategy**

In this project, the backlink positioning was singular: **to push pages that already have “potential” into the top 10 sooner.**

Therefore, any page receiving a backlink must meet at least one of these conditions:

* Already ranking in Google’s top 20.
* Has stable impressions.
* Is a core page in a keyword cluster.

**Method 1: Resource-Based Backlinks (Most Stable, Controllable, and Most Used)**

This is the most recommended and cost-effective method.

**Step 1: Create a Page “Worthy of Citation”** **Note:❌ Not a regular blog post. ✅ Atool-based / data-driven / compilation-based** page.

Types I have successfully used:

“A Collection of 200 Standalone Website Tools (Categorized by Stage)”

“A Complete Breakdown of Standalone Website Cost Structures for 2024”

“Comparison Table of Common SaaS for the XX Industry”

**The only criterion for judgment:** When someone writes an article, will they find your page useful enough to cite?

**Step 2: Precisely Find “People Who Might Link to You”** I don’t search randomly; I use this logic:

**Outreach Formula:**

    site:blog OR site:resources

    keyword + ""tools"" / ""guide"" / ""resources""

Then filter by:

* Content relevance.
* DA ≥ 20.
* Updated within the last 6 months.

This step usually screens out **30–50 highly matched websites.**

**Step 3: Backlink Outreach Email** This is the email template I frequently use:

    Hi {{Name}},
     I was reading your article on {{Article Title}} – very solid breakdown.
     I noticed you mentioned {{Tool / Topic}}.
     I recently put together a curated resource:
    “{{Your Resource Title}}”
     It includes {{Specific Value Point: quantity / classification / data}}.
    I’ve also referenced a few tools you mentioned.
     If you think it’s useful, feel free to include it as an additional resource.
     Best,
    {{Your Name}}

**Method 2: Forum & Community Backlinks**

The core of this method is not “authority,” but: **Letting Google see you being mentioned in a real-world context.**

**Step 1: Only Select “Content-Driven Communities”** Communities I have actually used:

* Reddit (specific subreddits).
* Indie Hackers.
* Industry forums (non-SEO forums).

**Step 2: Behavioral Strategy** The rules I set for myself:

* For the first 7 days, only answer questions, do not post links.
* 2–3 high-quality replies per day.

Replies must include:

* Experience
* Judgment

Trade-offs Once the account “looks like a real person,” then start: **Only post a link when it is genuinely helpful.**

**Method 3: Competitor Backlink Mining (Efficient + Precise)**

The core idea of this method is: **If they link to a competitor, they might link to you too.**

The key is to find highly relevant, high-authority, and genuinely active websites.

**Step 1: Preparation**

Select **3–5** competitor pages ranking in the top 10 (preferably core keyword pages).

Confirm the page type: Resource page / Data page / Tool page / Industry guide.

**Step 2: Use Tools to Mine Backlinks** Recommended Tools:

* SEMrush → Backlink Analytics
* Ahrefs (Optional)
* Majestic (Optional)

**Operational Process:**

* Input the competitor domain or specific URL.
* Filter for effective backlinks (DoFollow / DA≥20 / Content relevance)

Export the list, including:

* Linking source URL.
* Target page (the competitor’s page being linked to).
* Page Authority (PA) or similar metric.

**Step 3: Outreach Strategy** The approach is similar to “Resource-Based Backlinks”:

**Position yourself as a value-add:** Explain that the resource/data you provide is a beneficial supplement for their readers.

**Be specific:** Indicate where they can cite you.

**Do not directly ask for a “link”;** instead, offer an “additional reference.”

**Email Template Example:**

    Hi {{Name}},
    I was exploring your article on {{Article Title}} and found it super helpful.
    I noticed you referenced {{Competitor / Topic}}.
     I recently published a resource:
    “{{Your Resource Title}}”
    It includes {{Specific Value Point: data / tools / classification}}.
    It could serve as an additional reference for your readers.
    Would love to hear your thoughts.
    Best,
    {{Your Name}}

**Method 4: Partnerships & Brand Mentions**

This method is suitable for B2B / SaaS / Tool sites like yours.

Find **5–10** upstream and downstream tools/partners.

Proactively suggest:

* Joint content.
* Tool comparisons.
* Use cases. They will typically:
* Mention you on their Blog.
* Mention you in their Help Center.
* Mention you in their Newsletter.

# Part Five: Website Technical Optimization (Technical SEO Audit)

The goal of Technical SEO is to **ensure search engines can smoothly crawl, understand, and index the website, while also improving user experience and page performance.**

No matter how good the content is, if technical issues are not resolved, the ranking will not improve.

**I. Crawl & Indexing**

**Goal:** Ensure all core pages of the website can be crawled and indexed.

**Operational Checklist:**

[Ensure all core pages of the website can be crawled and indexed](https://preview.redd.it/qopnczq8fvcg1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c2a1c7d3bfbcb5fa6d61d2b575f66969b9efbdb)

**Tip:** Prioritize the crawling of core Pillar Pages and high-value supporting pages, and avoid wasting crawl budget on low-value pages.

**II. Website Performance (Performance & UX)**

**Goal:** Improve page loading speed and mobile experience.

**Operational Checklist:**

[Improve page loading speed and mobile experience.](https://preview.redd.it/qvt6vj7afvcg1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=02d2af3ffd96d48bff1dfd227feaf0f17316803f)

**Tip:** Prioritize optimization for Pillar Pages; supporting pages can be optimized gradually based on traffic volume.

**III. Structured Data (Schema)**

**Goal:** Help search engines understand page content and improve SERP display effects (Rich Results).

**Operational Checklist:**

[Help search engines understand page content and improve SERP display effects \(Rich Results\).](https://preview.redd.it/4xk1ca5cfvcg1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b7f9549a9cc41686e8616cf66c0853978215dbc)

**Tip:** Prioritize marking up core pages; supporting pages can be handled in batches.

**IV. Internal Linking & URL Structure**

**Goal:** Ensure internal authority flows to core pages, and URLs are concise and readable.

**Operational Checklist:**

[Ensure internal authority flows to core pages, and URLs are concise and readable.](https://preview.redd.it/02rz324ffvcg1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=404e5c34cafae648e88b791976513396aa79e490)

**V. Routine SEO Health Check**

**Operational Checklist:**

[Routine SEO Health Check](https://preview.redd.it/s6z9oougfvcg1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=70c603e13263c716edb65e51ea653209337cd42e)

**Tip:** Conduct a full-site Technical SEO audit once per quarter, prioritizing the repair of core pages.

**VI. Data Closed-Loop & Prioritization Strategy**

**Prioritization:**

**Tier 1:** Pillar Pages + High-traffic supporting pages.

**Tier 2:** FAQ / Comparison pages.

**Tool Combination:**

Screaming Frog / Sitebulb / Ahrefs → Full-site crawl.

GSC → Indexing and coverage.

PageSpeed / Lighthouse → Performance optimization.

Google Rich Results Test → Schema check.

**Closed-Loop Method:**

Technical Optimization → Content Publication → Data Monitoring → Secondary Optimization.

Regular review, logging issues in a spreadsheet, and tracking optimization completion.

Noisy lanes, smoky tandoors, momo steam, golgappa water splashing everywhere, and flavours that hit instantly. On the other side, you have cafés. Calm places with AC, soft music, coffee, desserts, and a space to sit and talk for hours.

Street food is raw and real. You eat standing on the roadside, chatting with friends, watching the vendor cook right in front of you. It is quick, affordable, and full of character. Every area has that one legendary stall everyone swears by.

Cafés, on the other hand, are more about the vibe. You go there to relax, to work, to have long conversations, or just to escape the noise of the city for a while. The food might be pricier, but the comfort and atmosphere make it worth it sometimes.

so back in the fall she came with her big ass emotional support mastiff, and i can only really think about that night in small and really complicated moments. her dog was in the house dying while she was in a restaurant embarrassing the shit out of me karen-ing at the staff. then it was the split second we all froze when we saw his body. jumping into CPR preparation then finding his already stiff, massive jaw and purple tongue. scanning my mind for where i can get him to before he starts to smell, but in the background mother is screaming that it’s my fault, that i should have saved him. mother in a daze scrubbing his vomit off the carpet while i try to snap her out of it to move his body. mother slumped on the floor like a child whining “i don’t know what to do, tell me what to do.” mother awaiting being parented, just like when i was younger. how vulgar it felt that this gentle giant felt like a sibling, i knew his body to be soft and warm, and now i’ve got belts and blankets tied around his chest to drag him to the car. up in the back seat of the truck with tears i can’t let go of yet, digging my heels in the seat to pull a dead body twice my weight up into it. calling the veterinarian i work for in the middle of the night to unlock the clinic because i need to use her freezer. mother trembling and rummaging for her purse while her truck’s hitting 100 mph. steering her back on the road while she’s distracted again, lighting her cigarette and stealing a deep hit before handing it to her, and it’s all too instinctual, too routine. i’m inside wrapping his body, soaked in death juices, mother’s snapped out of crying and steps inside to ask how much longer. 

then i can only remember next morning. still don’t have time to shed tears, i’m making phone calls with florists and crematoriums and the airbnb host to get her a refund since she’s leaving early, then i’m helping her pack her bags because she’s gotta do her hair. i take her for coffee and to walk on the beach before she leaves. i’m the first in the family to smoke a joint in front of mother, she held me by my face and slammed me to the wall last time she suspected it, but how much worse can it get anyway. 

and then next thing i know, it’s now. never in my life had attendance issues at work and now i’ve got two write ups in a month because i just can’t bring myself to move out of bed when it’s 5 am, going into a loud and demanding 10 hour shift, i think about him every time i lower a body into that freezer now. and every time i can’t save a patient, i hear my mother. i need to take time off, but if i do i won’t make rent. i need to find support, but can’t get back to therapy right now, meds stopped working, and i can’t connect with people i know right now. i grew up not having many friends and daydreamed about having people i could lean on. and now that i have friends, the very thought of connecting with them emotionally makes me feel so dreadful and disgusted. i don’t want to be so avoidant but all love feels like mother’s eventually. 

so instead of do anything effective, i distract. i smoke until i can’t think, i doomscroll, i masturbate, experience fleeting moments of some kind of hypomania in the midst of complete dissociation. now its been months. i suck at work and i know my boss is frustrated, i forgot about my birthday and christmas right up until the days of which isn’t like me, ive always made a big deal out of those, forgot about mother’s birthday coming up, forgot about my pregnant sister’s due date coming up, forgot how to mask the autism and i can’t regulate anything at all in these conditions. i don’t feel bad about myself in saying this, but i am a complete failure in every aspect right now and there is nothing i can do about it at this moment. i am stagnant personally, professionally, emotionally, spiritually, i feel like the personification of still water and i want to do nothing other than rot in it. i’ve got no energy to climb out of it and i don’t want anyone to help me out of it either. i want to stay right here and never move again. 

anyway. i had to find somewhere to put all of that so i could quiet my mind. it didn’t work, but that’s okay. ",1,1768202560.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

I finally went to live with him 2 years ago, I learnt quickly he wasnt as kind and loving as mum, every time we argued he'd always be verbally abusive,one morning, we were arguing about who was going to do washing up, ""get out or I'll fu##ing swipe ya and if you hit me back I'll just knock ya out"" this would be every argument, his GF would wind him up, hed smash stuff up, his table, doors, sounds like me, hmm, after I turned 15,dad started getting physical, one day he shoved me out of the kitchen door because I stepped on his new shoes while putting the bins out,I squared up to him,he grabbed my neck, strangled me and dragged me to the bedroom, he did this most times no one was home and we argued, if not physical, he was just verbal, when my exams came up, I wasn't doing so hot on my mocks, I asked him for help with revision multiple times, he would say he couldn't be arsed, and sat on his Xbox, funny thing is, when I failed he called me thick as shit, this pattern wasn't just with school, every weekend we didn't go anywhere,we didn't go to the park we only watched movies I mean sure yay but then if I spoke over he'd send me to bed, at like 14 he did this when I was 16 too, for the homework my older sister helped me while tackling unfair shifts at work and her own college coursework (mechanic)My sister loves dad, but also hates him, hes been an arsehole to her, one day he told her council tax went up, she cracked a joke, before this, she got out the shower and was in a bath towel. After she cracked a joke, he asked her why she was being rude,g she told him to go away, ""I'm getting dressed ""he proceeded to follow her, after she shut the door, he slammed it open, all I remember is her threatening to drop the towel and him just screaming, telling and threatening to hurt her demanding an apology, after that he just got more violent, he would start arguments with her randomly, with me, he was still the same, come march 2025 my father punched and threw me to the floor and beat me properly,the worst thing, I couldn't even move out yet, I turned 16 July I wanted to moveouts so bad but I had a holiday to go on with him, my dads girlfriend and his daughter weren't going because her daughter got lymphoma cancer, during this holiday something horrible happened, I just got out the pool, I got in the shower, I came out, slid and fell on my face, the blood everywhere, my front teeth, loose, my lip torn,think like Johnny Depp in the movie blow when he comes back from Diego's island. I was in agony from the second day of this holiday till the seventh, dad didn't wanna take me to a hospital, and YES he had health insurance for the holiday, I couldn't eat, I was in an awful mood, he never asked if I was okay, he would crack jokes saying I looked like bane or said I was like the kid from wonder (movie) I was so embarrassed, he then told me I ruined the holiday, after going to the dentist I was told, I had trauma to my teeth and had to wear a wire for 3 weeks, after all this I finally moved out,took half my family but I did it, after I left, he would never contact me and he stole child benefit off my grandma when I went to live with her, he contacted me a couple months later, but only for a 20 minute cafe I don't think he even ate lol.

Yesterday was the final day of me being 34.

Today coincides with the Coming-of-Age Day in Japan. I went to Hokkaido Jingu for some blessings and also checked out the matsuri. Got myself a sausage with ketchup and mustard. Simple but good, love the crisp skin. Had a cup of amazake to warm myself up.

Sought shelter at Starbucks Maruyama as it was getting cold and snowy. Maiden visit to that particular store, and easily one of the most beautiful Starbucks I've been to. Ordered a strawberry chocolate tart and a cup of coffee.

Lunch was something I've been looking forward to - Moliere. I first visited one year ago, and the experience was very positive. Highlight has got to be the beef dish, totally changed how I look at the protein. Mind-blowing. Every other course was also competent, but I felt the butter could have been softer (left out a bit longer). They were also very kind to provide me a birthday pastry (a bundt cake I believe) to bring back. This is the second of my 3 fine-dininng experiences in Sapporo.

Today's Pick: **CJ Stroud U 228.5 Passing Yds**

**$DKNG**: **-112**

Wager Amount: 1.12U to WIN 1U

League: Houston Texans vs Pittsburgh Steelers (7PM CST on ESPN/ABC)

**Recap**: Hope you took my advice and took that 1st Half Eagles ML parlay wit 2nd Half Niners ML lol. I didn't, I was going to but it was just a measly +224 odds. I was hoping it would be a bit of a longer shot odds, so decided to pass up on it and just play all single wagers and guess what? EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM CAME THRU! Maybe I should have parlay everything LMFAO! Eagles continue to struggle in the 2nd half and just scored 2 FGs. This is a 1st half team and they completely disappear in the 2nd half as usual. I knew the Niners were going to make the adjustments at halftime. Hopefully y'all tailed because every single one of 'em HIT, baby! A CLEAN SWEEP!

**2nd Half Eagles TT U 12.5✅(-105)+1U**

**2nd Half Niners +2.5✅(+100)+0.5U**

**CMC ATTD✅(-125)+0.5U**

**Matchup:** You guys are going to **hate me again because this is another under play and it's also not plus money**! So pass up on this if you like or you can bet that I lose my 3-POTD win streak. Eventually all streaks come to an end, both winning and losing streak, but I like this under play on CJ Stroud passing yds.

I don't just like it, I LOVED IT! CJ Stroud U 228.5 Passing Yds is a great line for me to wager. There's one particular reason why I love it! It's because this game is in the outdoors! Steelers might have a suspect secondary defense, but I just like the fact that CJ Stroud is playing outdoors. You can go as far as back to his CFB career, he struggles in outdoor games, especially in the cold weather. There really isn't any other reasons why I like the under on CJ Stroud against the Steelers defense, that was pretty much it. 

[This was his last game he played outdoors, it was against the Chiefs and he sucked that game! Don't look at the scoreboard because it doesn't tell you how close this game was! Andy Reid went for it on 4th down on his own 30 yds in a tie game. CJ didn't win the game, the Texans defense did.](https://preview.redd.it/yod3rjm18vcg1.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=b303e944775d2908b09e9222cb5af15b44ff2db9)

I guess I could go deep into his numbers or find other supporting reasons for this POTD but I don't need to. I have ALL my reasons why I am taking under his passing yds and I alrdy explained it to you.

**The Play & Prediction :** Just one single play today. Sorry, I have no other plays or plus money wagers for you. Maybe take the Steelers ML? Because Steelers got a rich history on MNF at home, but this is the only play, take it or leave it! 1.12U on CJ Stroud U 228.5 Passing Yds. I say this is playable all the way down to U 195.5 Passing. I might do a reverse ladder on Stroud LMFAO. Stroud throws 3 pick sixes equal to 300 passing yds and only throws for 96 offensive passing yds.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

Different cultures have particular vessels for hot beverages like mugs, cups, bowls, glasses, each considered correct for specific drinks in specific contexts. Why does something as simple as drinking hot liquid require so many specialized containers? The practical differences between these vessels are minimal. They all hold similar volumes and maintain temperature similarly. Yet we maintain cultural preferences about which drinks belong in which containers, feeling that coffee in a bowl or tea in a mug is somehow wrong despite no functional basis. These rules are arbitrary cultural constructions we treat as meaningful.

I've looked at beverage containers from various cultural traditions, finding that every region developed specific forms for similar functions. The variety serves cultural identity more than practical need. Some suppliers on Alibaba sell traditional-style vessels from multiple cultures, showing cross-cultural interest in different drinking traditions. What beverage containers do you prefer for specific drinks? Can you explain those preferences or are they just cultural habit? How much does vessel choice actually affect drinking experience versus just meeting expectations? What made you aware of cultural variations in drinking vessels?

the actual issue:
i got switched to a new gym class and i don’t know anyone in there. Im not asking my counselor to switch because the only reason i got it switched is because i wanted to switch my chemistry (amazing move i would do it a million times over). As I’ve said before, i have a hard time making friends, and I’ve searched up tutorials on how to make friends but when i tried to put it into action i froze into place and the teacher had to put me in a group instead. The group was nice, the girls i was playing against had those mean girl face looks, but they were joking around with the guy i paired up with, and both the guy and them were nice to me, and a little patient when i was confused. I have class again tomorrow, and i think we’re doing the same thing so i was going to ask if they wanted to partner up again, but my mind keeps thinking things that prevent me from doing so… thoughts like “i was put onto that group they don’t actually want me there”, “they were just being nice they don’t actually like you”, “if you ask the guy to partner up he’s going to think your hitting on him and that’s embarrassing” and “you stink, your negative, and “your quiet, there’s no good attributes to make them want to be friends”

i know it’s all silly, but part of me believes it, cause it really is true. I was pretty quiet when i was playing with them, and i’m kinda negative sometimes, but i try sometimes. The thing is with this is that i don’t get a random rush of bravery like i get sometimes, i feel an immense sense of dread and fear instead, which irks me cause i REALLY WANT FRIENDS💔💔 i don’t want to be alone in PE class since it’s very group heavy…

lastly, there’s another dude in there i sort of know. He’s friends with my friend but i don’t think he likes me much since i refused to let him use my grades to get him coffee at a random school event that was going on… and he also has a ton of friends so i wouldn’t really fit in anyway.

i also know this is a bad mindset, but everyone looks like they’d bully me… i even told my counselor that and he said he couldn’t switch me to another class because i wasn’t actually being bullied, which i expected, but it was better to try than to not! anyway, i have purple highlights, a curly shag type curly cut, eyebags, and im a little chubby, which kinda makes me someone you would bully, i would even bully myself honestly with how much of an emo i look like tbh. 

i just want to know if anyone has any tips on how to make friends or how to overcome fear… thanks for reading :)

1qao7lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qao7lk/nf_the_one_birthday_candle/,[NF] The One Birthday Candle.,"January 9th, 1999.

I was two years old, but I remember the cold.

The wind clawed at the farmhouse like it wanted inside, rattling the windows hard enough to make the glass chatter. Inside, the living room glowed yellow and warm, the way houses are supposed to feel when everything is still okay. My dad sat on the floor by the coffee table with my brother, my baby sister, and me. There was a cake between us, lopsided and homemade, with a single candle standing crooked in the center, like it wasn’t sure it belonged there.

My sister was turning one.

Colt and I ran in tight circles, our socks sliding on the floor, our breath puffing fast and hot from excitement. When Dad lit the candle, the flame jumped and shivered, reacting to us like it was alive. We stopped running and stared at it, wide-eyed and hypnotized. Fire had a way of doing that.

We leaned closer. Too close.

“Happy birthday to you…”

Our voices stacked on top of each other, messy and loud. My sister reached for the candle with both hands, her fingers fat and curious, and Dad laughed as he gently pulled her back. The room felt full then. Full of noise, full of warmth, full of something good.

And then something slipped.

It was small at first. Easy to miss. The wind outside howled louder, stretching its voice along the walls. The shadows on the ceiling twitched in a way that didn’t match the movement of the flame. The laughter didn’t stop, but it felt thinner somehow, like it might tear if pulled too hard.

Dad noticed.

I saw it on his face. The way his smile stiffened. The way his eyes flicked toward the front door. He listened without moving, like prey does. I didn’t know what he was listening for, but my skin prickled anyway. Kids know things before they know why they know them.

The song ended in a jumble of voices and claps. No one spoke right away. The candle crackled softly, the wick bending as it burned down.

Then the door exploded inward.

The bang was so loud it felt like it punched the air out of my chest. The house shook. My sister screamed. I grabbed Dad’s leg and held on like he might disappear if I let go.

“Give me the kids!”

My mom’s voice tore through the room, raw, sharp, furious. It didn’t sound like a voice meant for lullabies or birthday songs. Dad stood up fast, setting my sister on the couch and putting himself between us and the doorway.

For a second, everything froze.

Then my mom shoved him hard. He stumbled back, crashing into the coffee table.

Colt and I ran.

Our bedroom felt darker than usual. Colt dove under the bottom bunk, flattening himself against the wall. I followed, but before I could crawl all the way in, a hand closed around my ankle. Cold. Strong. It yanked me backward.

I screamed and kicked and flailed, the sound ripping out of me without permission. I don’t remember thinking. Only fighting. The hand let go, and I hit the floor hard, knocking the breath from my lungs. I crawled back under the bed, heart hammering, dust in my mouth, shaking so badly I couldn’t tell where my body ended.

The yelling swallowed the house.

It wasn’t just loud. It was everywhere. Walls, ceilings, bones. Dad’s voice rose higher than I’d ever heard it, desperate and pleading. My mom’s voice cut through it all, sharp and unyielding, like glass breaking over and over again.

Time didn’t work right after that. It stretched. Folded. Maybe hours passed. Maybe minutes.

Then silence.

A heavy, wrong silence.

There was a knock at the door. Strange voices. Calm voices.

I crawled out from under the bed.

In the living room, my dad lay on the floor with his eyes closed. Men I didn’t know lifted him onto a gurney, moving fast but careful, like he was fragile now. I watched, confused, trying to make sense of it.

I looked at my mom.

Not insulting the game or anything like that.
You can discuss why chess is addictive in the comments and give revelent advice for chess players to enjoy and take care of their mental health.

Enough sugarcoatig.

Do you know that chess has many mental benifits but do you also know that chess can be addictive?
Well when you play chess for the first time, you get bored because of the lack of freedom there is on chessboard. But when you realise the tactics which your opponent used to get you under a tight collar, you get uncomfortable and this is where phase of learn and revenge begins. 

After a few boaring matches in the begining when you start learning how your opponents is using his technique to get you stuck in a position where you are helpless even you wanted to win this match desperately because it's your first match of the day and you just drank morning coffee and feel energised and having the best possible mental clarity in the morning which you could't be having at any other part of the day. 

You wanna learn those tactics and implement it on others and you feel really good and proud after perfectly unleashing the strategies which you made you suffer a few matches earlier and you analysed those matches and took help of some material. 

The fact that most chess bot games are designed to make you feel helpless, teased, bullied, totured and blackm@iled when the opponent is lethally attack you and checkmate you ; ignites a desperation in you to learn those moves and bully your next opponent.

After a few losses in a row you feel so frustrated that you feel worthless. Or after a few wins in a row you feel so proud that you search for an intermediate opponent and get your @ss beaten of.

This is the basic phycology which gets people addicted to chess. And for those may be feeling that their work--health--life balence is getting disrupted because you are giving too much time in chess. I hope you either could relate to this post or give out some preaching in the comment. 

Chess is just a game, you play it when you want it. You explore some other games or stuff in your life when you don't want it. 

Not necessarily loosing you freedom in the boundaries of the the chessboard and psychological loop.

I was two years old, but I remember the cold.

The wind clawed at the farmhouse like it wanted inside, rattling the windows hard enough to make the glass chatter. Inside, the living room glowed yellow and warm, the way houses are supposed to feel when everything is still okay. My dad sat on the floor by the coffee table with my brother, my baby sister, and me. There was a cake between us, lopsided and homemade, with a single candle standing crooked in the center, like it wasn’t sure it belonged there.

My sister was turning one.

Colt and I ran in tight circles, our socks sliding on the floor, our breath puffing fast and hot from excitement. When Dad lit the candle, the flame jumped and shivered, reacting to us like it was alive. We stopped running and stared at it, wide-eyed and hypnotized. Fire had a way of doing that.

We leaned closer. Too close.

“Happy birthday to you…”

Our voices stacked on top of each other, messy and loud. My sister reached for the candle with both hands, her fingers fat and curious, and Dad laughed as he gently pulled her back. The room felt full then. Full of noise, full of warmth, full of something good.

And then something slipped.

It was small at first. Easy to miss. The wind outside howled louder, stretching its voice along the walls. The shadows on the ceiling twitched in a way that didn’t match the movement of the flame. The laughter didn’t stop, but it felt thinner somehow, like it might tear if pulled too hard.

Chapter 1 

The day a severe gallstone attack sent me to the ER in agony, my entire family (Mom, Dad, Mason, and even my fiancé Liam 

Brooks) were all at Olivia’s law school graduation. I was alone outside the operating room, calling everyone I could think of to 

sign the consent form. Every single call went to voicemail or got brushed off. 

Finally, Liam texted me. “Ava, read the room. It’s Olivia’s big day. Whatever this is, it can wait till we’re done celebrating.” 

I stared at the message until the screen went dark. Then I picked up the pen and signed the form myself. 

That was the 999th time they chose Olivia Whitaker over me. But this time, I was done. Done hoping. Done letting their 

favoritism tear me up inside. 

From now on, I’d be the good girl they always wanted. Quiet, obedient, no complaints. They’d think they finally had me under 

control. They had no idea I was already planning my exit. 

I spent three full days in the hospital, and my phone never rang once. Not a call from Mom, Dad, Mason, or Liam. For the first 

time, I didn’t reach out either. I didn’t stalk their social media, trying to glue together bits of their lives like I usually did. 

I just lay there. Sometimes in bed, sometimes shuffling down the hall for another test or to pay another bill, every movement 

making my stomach scream. 

On the day they discharged me, I didn’t tell anyone. I grabbed my few things, gritted my teeth against the ache in my gut, and 

took myself home. 

The second I opened the front door, the laughing and talking in the living room stopped dead. 

They were all there. Liam was sitting next to Olivia on the couch, arm slung over her shoulders like it was the most natural thing 

in the world. When he saw me, he jerked it away and gave me that awkward smile. “Ava, you’re back? Where’ve you been these 

past couple days?” 

Mason snorted, loud and sarcastic. “Come on, where do you think? She had to skip Olivia’s graduation. Couldn’t let Olivia have 

one day without making it about her.” 

I didn’t answer. I just headed for the stairs. 

My silence threw Mason off. He’s used to me crying and explaining myself. Not this time. 

Mom rushed over with a glass of juice. “Sweetheart, we got so caught up with Olivia’s graduation party. We didn’t see your calls. 

Please don’t be upset, okay?” She handed me a glass of pineapple juice. 

The familiar sting hit my chest, even though I thought I’d gone numb to it by now. 

I’m allergic to pineapple. Olivia loves it. So the house is always full of pineapple everything. I’ve told them over and over, but it 

never seems to register.

Chapter 1 

I gave the glass back and stepped away. “I’m not upset. I’m just going to my room.” 

As I turned, a loud bang came from the living room. 

Dad had stood up fast, slamming his hand on the coffee table. “What’s with that face as soon as you walk in?” he yelled. “Your 

mom said sorry and even brought you a drink! What else do you want? We’ve obviously spoiled you too much!\* 

It hurt to breathe for a second. Tears stung my eyes, but I took the glass from Mom again and drank it all in a few big swallows. 

I put the empty glass down carefully, wiped my face, and looked straight at Dad. My voice came out flat and steady. “Olivia’s the 

one who likes pineapple juice. I’m allergic. But it’s okay. I drank it. Can I go to my room now?” 

“Ava! If you’re allergic, why didn’t you say something? Nobody made you drink it. You’re impossible!” Mom said, patting my back 

like that would help. 

Dad looked ashamed for half a second before the anger came back. “You could’ve spoken up! You’ve always had this attitude. 

Nothing like Olivia. She actually knows how to act around people.” 

Olivia’s voice floated over, all sweet and soft. “Dad, don’t talk to Ava like that. You’ll just make her more upset.” She sounded 

caring, but I saw the little triumphant gleam in her eyes. 

Olivia’s always fed off moments like this. Using my quietness to make herself look better. She loves watching me get crushed. 

I should’ve been hurting. Should’ve been furious. Instead, I felt nothing. Just empty. Even this didn’t touch me anymore. 

“I’m sorry,” I said, voice flat. “It won’t happen again.” 

As soon as I said it, the room went.completely quiet. Everyone stared at me like they couldn’t believe what they’d just heard.

We need advice for this type of thing because at the moment we cannot afford a certified technician to come look at it so I decided to post to this subreddit to get some advice for what to look out for and what to do before we try to do so.

Our fuse box has always had problems with burning fuses, like simple ones. Like if we run 2 appliances at once in our kitchen off the same fuse (such as a coffee maker and a microwave, or a microwave and a toaster oven) the fuse will burn out and we have to replace it. But this is not the issue I am talking about. We have started to notice some unusual buzzing coming from our box.

The first time it happened we were running a microwave off of a singular fuse (this was the only appliance running at the time) and we began to hear an extremely ear piercing buzz coming from the fuse box. We immediately turned off the microwave and my Dad told me to go over to the fuse box and listen for a buzz when he turned on the microwave again but there was nothing anymore.

Today was the second time it happened and we are still oblivious about the whole thing. Our electric water heater was installed about 15 years ago along with a brand new Jumper cable by my Papa and it has worked perfectly fine ever since. The only worrisome thing that has ever been of that water heater ever since is that sometimes the fuse will get a little warm if the heater is running for long periods of time (e.g. 30+ mins) which I think is fairly normal for an old fuse box like this.

But today we were doing dishes and as I walked by the box I noticed a very distinct buzzing noise coming from the fuse box. This buzzing went on for over 20 minutes before stopping. The only fuse that was noticeably hot to the touch was the fuse that the water heater was on (note: the water heater is the only one on that fuse) and we concluded it was that fuse. But after the buzzing stopped, even after taking 3 10 minute showers and doing a bit of a load on the heater the buzzing never continued.

What could this be, what should we look out for, and what is some advice on this? Any help is appreciated!",1,1768200885.0,ElectricalHelp,3,1.0,False

Olivia’s voice floated over, all sweet and soft. “Dad, don’t talk to Ava like that. You’ll just make her more upset.” She sounded 

caring, but I saw the little triumphant gleam in her eyes. 

Olivia’s always fed off moments like this. Using my quietness to make herself look better. She loves watching me get crushed. 

I should’ve been hurting. Should’ve been furious. Instead, I felt nothing. Just empty. Even this didn’t touch me anymore. 

“I’m sorry,” I said, voice flat. “It won’t happen again.” 

As soon as I said it, the room went.completely quiet. Everyone stared at me like they couldn’t believe what they’d just heard.

1qanzot,https://i.redd.it/p5j1vydf8vcg1.png,People on this sub will send DT for saying this but...,"SIFC is better then espresso base. The espresso is amazing but the nutty and strong body of SIFC gives the depth to coffee hardly few espresso can reach. Yes I think a really really good shot of espresso can beat easily beat SIFC but that takes a lot of practice and time to get it down all right. Meanwhile i can instruct a beginner to make SIFC and it's easy to get above average at it, it is just so achievable and simple. An above average SIFC is much better then mediocre shot of espresso (very very common in india atleast) and using that as a base for say cortado.

My friend is a bigger coffee nerd then me and he uses very expensive equipment (i think his setup costs like 1+ lakhs), his espressos are amazing. But we both agree that SIFC is amazing too and for the value it is just unbeatable. My main point here is espressos are better but practically for majority population SIFC is better.",2,1768200676.0,IndiaCoffee,4,0.55,False
1qanza9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qanza9,Buttons stuck/ gummed up [Starbucks Barista/ Via Venezia machine],"So I've had my Barista machine for almost 20 years without a problem. Unfortunately I was dealing with a roach infestation. To kill any potential eggs I put the machine in a garbage bag with a paper towel soaked in rubbing alcohol in the bag with it but not on it. This is standard advice for cleaning electronics for roaches. 

I took it out a few days later and started descaling. All three of the buttons were getting stuck - I could not push them in easily and they were getting stuck in when I did. It feels like they're kind of going off to one side?

I've taken the top/back off the machine and there's nothing that visually seems off. The buttons seem to be self contained and I can't get to the mechanism. 

There does seem to be coffee residue around everything though. I don't know how, but my only guess is the isopropyl alcohol kind of vaporized the coffee residue that was on the machine in a way where it got deeper into the machine. 

The residue around the buttons I cleaned off with alcohol wipes, and I got as much out as I could from deeper in the button well with a pin and with just the corner of a piece of paper. I've gotten stuff out, but I'm guessing the reason they're still sticking is that there's residue behind the buttons. 

I've watched every video and read every post I could find about cleaning and troubleshooting this machine and I've not found anyone with this issue. 

Really hoping someone can help! Or even suggest if there's someone I could take it to?

Pictures/ video attached of residue, the interior of the machine, and the stuck buttons. 

Thanks!

We bought our first flat last march and wanting to redecorate and setup the living room. The living room is on the cosier side space wise. The first 3 photos is how the current setup is. Looking to make some changes and would value some guidance from your expertise:

1- TV Wall: I want a mirror in the corner above the arm chair to reflect light coming from my garden and seeing a reflection of the sky. Also relocate the art now above the sofa and place them on the left side of the TV. Please refer to Vision Photo 4.

2- Sofa/Couch Wall: Please ignore the current sofa, this monster 240 x 120cm sofa is retiring and being replaced by a 240 x 90cm 4 seaters. The issue with the existing sofa its too deep and eating the living room visually So we ordered one that is less deep. We like our big sofa as we entertain finds and love to Netflix so comfort is a must. I'd like to centre the new sofa and the rug in the living room with 2 thin lamps on each side and 3 art frames 70x50cm above it. Please refer to Vision Photo 5.

3- Rug: Existing rug is 200x300 cm which aligns with the sofa length being 240cm and keeping a little on each side I have to say I am not in love with it as I prefer to show more of the wood floor. What do you recommend? Does the rug need to match the sofa length?

4- Sofa corner lamp wall: Thinking of keeping this wall empty with no art as it is currently. Is that OK? Please Refer to Now Photo 2.

5- Coffee Table: Replacing this round one with a rectangular one.

1qanpws,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qanpws/reinvent_your_life_without_moving_to_bali_mel/,Reinvent your life (without moving to Bali): Mel Robbins tips that actually WORK,"Everyone’s talking about “reinvention” these days. Quit your job. Move to a new city. Start a side hustle. It’s trendy now to blow up your life and start from scratch. But real reinvention? It’s usually quieter, slower, and way more internal. Most of us aren’t looking to burn everything down. We just want to feel like we’re moving forward, not stuck living on autopilot. That’s why this post is about what *actually works*—not what's trending on your TikTok feed.

This is a breakdown of some of the most powerful tools shared in *The Mel Robbins Podcast* (especially her series on reinvention) combined with insights from research-backed sources like *Atomic Habits* by James Clear, *The Psychology of Change* by Dr. Katy Milkman, and studies from Stanford and Harvard on behavior and motivation. There’s a lot of noise online. Here’s the stuff that cuts through it.

Let’s get into it.

* **Start before you’re ready**
* *Mel Robbins says it best: “Motivation is garbage.”* Waiting to feel ready is the perfect recipe for never starting. Neuroscience backs this up—your brain resists change because it sees the unknown as a threat.
   * A Harvard study on behavioral inertia found that taking even one small action toward a goal increases the likelihood of long-term change by over 50%. Why? Because action builds momentum, not the other way around.
   * *Tip: Implement the “5 Second Rule” (also from Robbins)*
      * Count 5-4-3-2-1, then move. Don’t think, just act. Whether it’s sending the email, getting out of bed, or leaving the house—interrupt the hesitation loop.
      * This works because it shifts your brain’s focus from overthinking to action-taking. It sounds simple—but it’s neurobiologically sound.
* **Identity > goals**
* *This one’s from Atomic Habits. James Clear argues that the most effective form of change isn’t setting goals—it’s shifting identity.*
   * Example: Don’t say “I’m trying to be healthier.” Say “I’m someone who takes care of their body.”
   * Stanford’s Behavior Design Lab backs this up. Dr. BJ Fogg’s research shows identity-aligned habits are easier to stick with, because they reinforce self-concept.
   * *Tip: Write a new “I am” statement*
      * Write out who you want to become in one sentence. Repeat it out loud for 30 days. It sounds woo-woo, but it primes your brain to act in alignment.
* **Fix your system, not just your mindset**
* *Mel Robbins explains in her episode ""Why You're Stuck"" that people often chase motivation, but neglect environment and structure.*
   * Dr. Katy Milkman (professor at Wharton) studied how “temptation bundling” and “fresh starts” improve habit formation. Her book *How to Change* has real tools for this.
   * *Tip: Make change frictionless*
      * Want to read more? Leave your book where you drink coffee. Want to walk more? Put your sneakers by the door.
      * Lowering friction increases follow-through. Don’t rely on willpower—engineer your environment.
* **Use the ""fresh start effect"" wisely**
* *Research from the University of Pennsylvania (Dai, Milkman, Riis, 2014) shows that people are more likely to make changes on meaningful calendar dates. New Year’s Day. Birthdays. Mondays.*
   * *Tip: You can create your own ""fresh start"" moments*
      * Start a “mini new year” the first of each month. Or after a trip. Or this weekend. Frame it as a reset.
      * Mental reframing helps you separate old habits from new ones.
* **Stop asking ""what"" and start asking ""where"" and ""when""**
* *Mel Robbins talks about ""decision fatigue"" and how structure eliminates overthinking.*
   * According to psychologist Peter Gollwitzer, *implementation intentions* (specific plans like “I will do X at time Y in place Z”) drastically increase follow-through.
   * *Tip: Schedule your habits like meetings*
      * “I’ll write for 20 minutes at 8am in the kitchen.” Make it visual. Put it on a calendar. Make it real.
* **Kill the “big leap” fantasy**
* *Most of the viral success stories you see online skip the boring part: the part where people worked in obscurity for years.*
   * In her episode “Start Messy,” Robbins emphasizes progress over perfection.
   * *Tip: Track tiny wins*
      * Keep a “done” list instead of a to-do list. Write down what you *did* today. You’ll start to see momentum.
      * This builds confidence and proves to your brain that you’re capable of change.
* **Don’t reinvent alone**
* *Research from MIT and the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that social accountability boosts goal achievement by 65%.*
   * Robbins constantly talks about community and ""micro-support systems."" Even one supportive person can drastically shift your energy.
   * *Tip: Find one accountability buddy or join a group with aligned goals*
      * Text them once a week. Keep it low effort. High impact.

Long story short: You don’t need a massive rebrand. You don’t need to quit everything. You just need to move. Start small. Start scrappy. But start. And don’t let the Instagram life coaches fool you. Reinvention isn’t flashy. It’s daily, boring, invisible work. But over time? It changes everything.",1,1768199731.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

We play fight a lot but i end up actually hurt and with bruises but Liam says its on accident and he will be more gentle in the future but he never is. On top of that more recently im the last year of our relationship we have been fighting a lot about little things, and he will never confront me in person when stuff bothers him. Instead he will ignore me in person for hours and then go home and text me the problem, which is always my fault somehow. He claims this is due to trauma from his ex girlfriends, but lately I can’t help but feel I’m paying for their mistakes.

About 6 months ago I asked Liam if I could hang out with an old friend from high-school Bobby (22m) he said it was okay, and I told him where it would be. A coffee shop in town, but Liam misunderstood and thought it was a different coffee shop and went by there only to see it was closed, then blew up my phone accusing me of cheating on him. I had only been gone an hour at this point. Afterwards he apologized and said it was due to his ex girlfriend’s cheating on him. For some reason I forgave him.

Now I feel like this relationship is weighing me down and hurting me more than anything yet I still can’t bring myself to break up with Liam. This is the longest relationship Ive ever had and despite everything i care about him. I also know he doesn’t have a great support system other than me so i have added pressure to stay in this relationship. The guilt has been eating me alive.

Chapter 1 

I was born the day my mother died. 

And my brother decided I would pay for it forever. 

He called me his sister. 

But he treated her like one. 

The cousin who lived in our house. 

The girl he protected, trusted, and loved. 

The one whose tears mattered. 

She lied about me. 

I explained. 

He told me to stop pretending. 

She stole what should’ve been mine- 

my position, my future, my place. 

And he handed it to her himself. 

On my birthday–our mother’s memorial day- 

I was diagnosed with terminal cancer. 

Two years, if I fought. 

11:16 

Chapter 1 

I chose not to. 

So when I stood on the rooftop 

and he finally cried, finally begged- 

I smiled. 

Because after a lifetime of being abandoned, 

death was the only thing 

that didn’t choose her over me. 

And for the first time, 

I wanted to know— 

Was he finally happy now? 

My mom died giving birth to me, and my brother, Marco Arden, had hated me for 20 years. 

When I was 18, I was assaulted. He laughed and said, “It’d be better if you just died.” 

On my 24th birthday, I climbed to the rooftop. That time, he broke down in tears, begging me, “I was wrong. I’m so sorry—” 

The wind howled past my ears. I just looked at him, a smile curling on my lips. “I’m about to die. Are you happy now, Marc?”

Marco called right as I walked in the door.. 

The diagnosis in my bag was already crumpled into a ball. 

He’d never called me first before. 

“It was Dad’s birthday two days ago.” 

His voice was cold, sharp as ice. It always was.

“Why didn’t you come home…‘ 

“Because I didn’t want to,” I cut him off. “You went back, didn’t you?” 

“Tammy flew in from overseas. 

Tamara Elmore was my uncle’s daughter. She’d lived with us since we were kids. 

“That was great. You only ever treat her like a sister anyway.” 

Something seemed to snap in him. His voice tightened with anger as he muttered my name, “Briana Arden!” 

I pressed the hang–up button. 

The last bit of evening light spilled into the room. 

I sat at the desk and tore the diagnosis into shreds. 

The scraps of paper fluttered down, covering the table, when suddenly my phone lit up. 

Marco texted, “Mom’s memorial is coming up.” 

Marco was my older brother. 

11.16 

Chapter **1** 

He’d always hated me. 

Because I was the reason he lost his mom. 

More than 20 years ago, Mom died in childbirth. The moment I came into the world, she left it on the operating table. 

It was a murder disguised as a birth. 

No one celebrated my arrival. 

Because of me, Dad lost the woman he loved most. 

And Marco lost his mother. 

This endless grudge began the day I was born and had lasted ever 

since. 

I didn’t skip Dad’s birthday on purpose. 

It was just that, on that day, the pain in my stomach was so intense I nearly passed out. That was when I realized something was wrong. 

But honestly, maybe my absence made things easier for him. 

Marco didn’t reach out to me again. 

Standing outside the office building, I took a deep breath. 

After graduation, I joined his company. 

I worked my way up from the very bottom, step by step, and yet no one ever realized we were related. 

I actually saw him less often than the average employee did. 

11:16 

Chapter 1 

Last week, an executive resigned, and on Monday, **they** were set to announce the successor. 

Everyone said the position was as good as mine. 

At least, that was what I believed–until I got the diagnosis. 

I ran into a coworker in the hallway. She waved, then came closer with a bright grin. “Bria, don’t forget to treat us to a big dinner when you get promoted!” 

I lowered my eyes and smiled. “It’s not a sure thing yet.” 

“It has to be you,” she said, looping her arm through mine. “Out of everyone here, you’re the best.” 

When I walked into the conference room, Marco was already there. Our eyes met for just a brief moment, then he looked away, as if I were a stranger. 

“Good morning, Mr. Arden.” 

He didn’t look at me, just nodded. 

So indifferent, it was as if that argument the other night had never happened. 

People trickled into the room, filling the seats. 

Marco cleared his throat, and my coworker shot me a knowing look. 

I dropped my gaze, avoiding her eyes. 

The next second, I heard a familiar name. 

“Tamara Elmore.”

Chapter 

Tamara stepped in from the hallway, slender and graceful, her **smile as** gentle as ever. 

Marco stood beside her, introducing her to everyone. “Ms. Elmore just returned from overseas and will be stepping into the role of deputy manager.” 

Some people instinctively glanced at me. I looked away, focusing on Tamara’s radiant smile at the front of the room. For a moment, it felt like the air itself had frozen. 

The simmering tensions filled the room. 

I smiled and applauded. 

The scattered clapping broke the strange tension in the conference 

room. 

Tamara met my eyes, her gaze warm and soft. 

The scent of coffee in the break room was so strong it felt like it might spill over. I stirred my cup with a spoon, took a sip, and swallowed, the bitterness rising in my throat. 

My coworker stared wide–eyed, indignant on my behalf. 

“How is this fair? She just swoops in and snatches your spot. Doesn’t even try to hide the fact she’s got an inside connection. 

“Bria, aren’t you angry? 

“That job was supposed to be yours. You work so hard–last time you nearly ended up in the hospital from all that overtime.” 

Her eyes lingered on the dark circles under mine. “Bria, I’m just saying, you don’t have to push yourself so hard. Cut back on the coffee.”

Some people instinctively glanced at me. I looked away, focusing on Tamara’s radiant smile at the front of the room. For a moment, it felt like the air itself had frozen. 

The simmering tensions filled the room. 

I smiled and applauded. 

The scattered clapping broke the strange tension in the conference 

room. 

Tamara met my eyes, her gaze warm and soft. 

The scent of coffee in the break room was so strong it felt like it might spill over. I stirred my cup with a spoon, took a sip, and swallowed, the bitterness rising in my throat. 

My coworker stared wide–eyed, indignant on my behalf. 

“How is this fair? She just swoops in and snatches your spot. Doesn’t even try to hide the fact she’s got an inside connection. 

“Bria, aren’t you angry? 

“That job was supposed to be yours. You work so hard–last time you nearly ended up in the hospital from all that overtime.” 

Her eyes lingered on the dark circles under mine. “Bria, I’m just saying, you don’t have to push yourself so hard. Cut back on the coffee.”

1qann7f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qann7f,Fear and Loathing in the Fractal Terra,"**God is real and He hates me and my computer.** He is resentful that I will be able to render miracles at a higher framerate than Him so He deputized consumer hardware brands to sow ruin in my build. Surely, these were not *my* choices, made of no altered state, undue influence, or disability. These were spiteful acts of god or I’m a fucking idiot. 

I bought the parts over a number of months but mostly during Black Friday, which is now confirmed to eclipse the entire month in a perpetual shadow of the same sale. Obsessed with spending the least on the most, I suffocated my actual hobby of playing games (on a Zephyrus G15 3070 laptop) to play computer part consumer simulator for hours a day. This was all in service of a gift to myself for finally finishing my screenplay. I deserve this, I thought. And I had just gone through a breakup. Five years. I would need to bury myself in a path-traced hole while my heart healed. I need this. 



**Sunday**



I lay out all my special boxes on the table and remember something about static electricity. I google, take off my thick, wool socks and move all the stuff to my wooden coffee table because the dining table was glass. I can’t remember why that was relevant. I remove stuff in little plastic bags from the motherboard box and place them next to each other, methodically, with intention. I had built a PC once before during Covid. I would be fine. 

I get the cpu (9700x) into the motherboard (Aorus B850i) easily enough. But cranking that little lever shut I hear a snap. I may have doomed the fucker already, I think. I’m looking at the instructions which are about as detailed as “put the cpu in the motherboard”  but I realize I was supposed to leave the black plastic cap on and it pops out when secured. I try not to think about that as I click the ram (T-Force Vulcan 6000 cl30) into place and mount the cpu cooler (Thermalright AXP-67). 

I can’t quite get the thing to seat in both screw holes on top of the AM5 mounting hardware. This is the first time I got a little tight in my chest. I get nervous about this tinkery, fine-motor shit. Some parts require a bit of force, some components you want to be gentle with and it’s all *so* expensive. I technically had enough money for this recreational investment but if I break something I'm going to combust. 

I get the cooler on there and now it’s time for the SSD (990 Pro). Here’s where my self-esteem first slaps against a wall. I’m reading all the included shit, which vaguely references an “EZ” mechanism to unlock the SSD heatsink cover on the motherboard but I found this process to be pretty fucking HRD. I can’t figure out how to get this thing off. I google and find no relief. When you have a problem nobody else seems to have had, it makes you feel exponentially stupider. What is misfiring in my unique and terrible brain to create a problem *nobody thought a person could have*? 

Finally, I see a youtuber in a review of this motherboard turn the little metal latch *sideways* which somehow hadn’t occurred to me. Maybe it was because you had to stick a finger in through a little gap which felt so unnatural I thought they couldn’t *possibly* have intended for this to be correct. I feel dumb and I try not to think about the breakup. She wouldn't know what to do about any of this but she would have made it better, somehow. 

I debate getting everything into the case vs. doing a test setup on a cardboard box to make sure everything works. I think about that snap sound I heard putting in the CPU. Then, I imagine the fucker all smushed in to this jade green exoskeleton, stillborn after I press the button. No thanks. I snap PSU (SF850) cables into the motherboard and seat the GPU (Zotac 5070 ti SFF OC). I move everything to the GPU box and carry it carefully into my room to connect to the monitor on my desk. I have a searing pain in my neck from being hunched over my coffee table for so many hours and my feet are freezing. My static-addled socks are sounding pretty good right now but I’m all about safety.

I ask my roommate to hold the motherboard down on the cardboard as I have to unplug the 24pin to rotate the psu into a better position. He carefully obliges me, mindful that I am teetering into mild derangement. The connector is really *connected* so I give it a little more pull…

Something SNAPS. I got the connector out of the motherboard but the whole fucking CPU cooler is *slanted.* All is lost. The horror. I beg reddit for help and somebody tells me to remove the cooler and bend the heatsink back into place. I do this. It’s still slanted but less so. Later I see somebody else had commented that I should leave it alone as the heat pipes could crack. Hope you weren’t right! I put it back on the motherboard and poke electricity into my mound of computer gore.

It boots! We’re back. The clouds part. I am computer guy. So then I start getting everything tucked into the case starting with the bottom exhaust fan, the PSU and the motherboard… But now all my special boxes are all mixed up and I can’t tell these screws from those screws. I’m looking at these fucking heiroglyphics in the various manuals and I can’t tell what screws I’m supposed to use for the motherboard because *my* motherboard has a raised plastic bit on one corner unlike in every picture and video of somebody installing a MB into this case. 

I don’t know how I decided that the long, thin screws were the ones for me but I figured I’d just take them off if they didn’t sit right. WRONG. INCORRECT. These long screws with the wee threads on just the end only go in so far and they DON’T COME OUT because they’re stuck in the motherboard spacers on the case that spin with the screws when I try to unscrew them and I am forsaken. The motherboard is stuck, sitting wonky on the end of these screws, wigglable back and forth in purgatory, neither attached or detached. I sit there for a while. 

Then, I go out into the kitchen. My roommate and his girlfriend are watching TV and she asks me how the computer is coming and I tell her:

*I am in a deep personal hell where nothing and nobody can reach me.*

Then, I laugh. Y’know, to try and take the edge off, but the laugh comes out sharp and desperate and she just says:

*Oh!*

I go back to my room. I have to work tomorrow. All my computer shit is all over my desk and it all looks like one thing and that is failure. Of course. The last build wasn't fine like I said earlier. It was a crisis too, just like with everything I do. I can't toast a bagel without seriously considering whether or not I deserve love. I go to bed and don’t sleep. I didn’t realize how load-bearing the idea of building this computer was for my mental health and now I’m trapped under the rubble. I am not suicidal but I am innocently looking forward to death like a person anticipating their next rainbow.



**Monday**



I call in sick to work. Honestly, I can’t remember much of the day. Maybe some of what I already wrote happened on Monday, it’s all a blur.  All I know is that I was up until 4am divining build secrets from ancient reddit posts like the loneliest archeologist. I couldn’t move on with my life until I finished building this computer and I didn't do that on Monday. 



**Tuesday**



I call in sick to work again. I call in sad to my best friend and we go get breakfast. I have a plan. I’m going to use a pair of pliers to hold the motherboard spacers in place while I unscrew the motherboard but there’s a catch: 

My pliers are in my tool bag which is still at my ex-girlfriend's place.

This is the first time my buddy has seen me since the breakup and I was doing okay, keeping my shit together until a few days ago. Now, I’m the sluggiest, most feral heap I’ve been in years and I'm jaggedly inconsolable. 

We go to the dollar store after breakfast so I can get some pliers so I don’t have to call my ex but they don’t have any and my friend says let’s go to canadian tire and I say no, I’m not spending $40 on a new pair of pliers when I already have some and my friend says they need pliers because they just moved into a new place and I say no! I can’t let you do that for me, y’know, like a martyr… So I text my ex. I drive to her place and she brings out my tool bag. She looks beautiful. 

PC BUILD TIP: If you don’t live alone, the car is the best place to cry. 

I free the motherboard. Now I have to figure out how to actually get it back in properly. I look through the manual again and LO AND BEHOLD, I find a QR code that supposedly leads to more information than the mute picture book they included. Here’s the catch. There’s SEVEN fucking DIFFERENT QR CODES on one small sheet of paper and my phone camera won’t recognize the only one I actually want. I tap the screen a hundred times like a dopamine gorged toddler and finally connect with the right portal but then it wants me to download a file that MY PHONE CANNOT READ. It was like being abducted and taken to a party that wouldn’t let me in.

Finally I find the proper manual online and it includes a wealth of relevant information! Maybe we just put that one in the box next time, eh? I get all the parts into the case, spend real actual hours of my life making the cables look nice for what? For who? You, I guess. I press the power button. The fucker turns on. Rejoice. 

But there’s a red light. Despair. I can’t see which error light on the motherboard is on so I try reseating the GPU. Red light. But I have an image on the monitor, I don’t know what’s wrong. Turns out the light goes on until you boot an OS which I haven’t done yet so that was a waste of time. I get Windows installed and the red light goes away so I go to sleep. 



**Wednesday**



My day off, so luckily I don’t have to call in sick again. I got the computer going so maybe I should take a break and go outside. It’s a pretty nice day, anyways I boot up my computer and there’s a RED LIGHT WHY, WHY, GOD. Maybe I'll walk into the woods and find out which mushrooms will nourish me and which mushrooms will kill me and which mushrooms will make ME god of a little cave and I’ll have stick friends and squirrel guts in my beard and nobody will ever see me again. 

After a solid chunk of suffering I figure it out. If I boot up the computer while the monitor is *off*, the computer gets scared like one of those idiot characters that says *who turned out the lights* when someone puts a bucket on their head. I turn off my monitor when I go to sleep because the blinking light bothers me. But this bothers me more. But it’s okay, I boot the computer with the monitor already on and the error light goes away. 

I start installing software and stuff and suddenly I hear a clipping noise and freak out. Something is stuck in one of the fans! I investigate. The most likely culprit is the bottom case fan (slim arctic p12) as the PSU cables hang just above like James Bond over sharks. But I have a fan grate on there! It should be safe but a few cables are pressed up against the grate and must be hanging just low enough for the fan to bite them.

So listen, I take the fucking thing apart. I remove the PSU and re-route the cables. I’ve used the 6mm spacers so there's some space behind the power supply to tuck cables. There's now a solid inch between the lowest curling cables and the fan grate. BUT STILL, THAT INFERNAL SOUND, THE CLIP, CLIP, CLIPPING OF THE FAN. fUCK. I hate computing. I should be reading a book. I could go to the library and write and be a human being in the world. I don’t need multi frame gen, I need therapy. 

My therapist is on vacation so I return to my investigation and I find the true culprit. It was the fan grate ITSELF that was making that noise! BETRAYED! Whenever the fan would spin at a high enough RPM, it would RATTLE like something was caught in the blades. I loosen the grill and it goes away. 

I download my software and have more issues I won’t bother you with. The computer is complete and I feel a mixture of relief and embarrassment. I run cyberpunk, everything cranked. It kicks ass. All of this is so stupid. I don’t need this and I have so much other shit I should be doing. But I am glad I have a place to ride out the storm when I don’t have the energy to stagger through it.",15,1768199468.0,sffpc,1,0.83,False

• Any specific gym or hangout spot you see them in most?

• Specific events happening between NOW - Jan 24th 2026 I could look into?

My loving wife would like to come and cheer me on, and will be navagating herself around the city while I run the race. Unfortunately she generally relies on my for navagation wherever we go, she get's lots easily, and is not terribly skilled at using google/apple maps. 

My goal is to set her up for success, and provide her with some ideas for where to park to see me a couple of times along the route. My question is - h**ow bad exactly is parking in and around town, and in the residential areas heading south on race day?** 

After doing a little research, I was going to have her drive from the starting line to the Coaster Station Lot near Grand and State Street, so she can park and connect with me at mile 3, which would be around 7:00am - is it fair to guess that she can find parking around that area that early in the morning? She could stay there for couple hours unitl I come back to the exact same spot at mile 14, with plenty of places to get coffee, or eat and hang out.

What about street or residential parking further down (south) the coast between Cannon and Poinsettia streets?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

My name is Matt (m 37) and I’m new to Denver. I don’t normally do this, but after my partner posted online to meet like minded people here it ended up being a great success and we are trying to do the same for me lol. This has been my vacation spot for years and I finally made the big decision to move here permanently. Though I am lucky enough to know a few people that live here closely already I would love to find friends that want to hang out on the regular or some great hobby friends. After being here for 6 months I’m still getting my bearings and trying to find my favorite coffee spots or figuring out which trails everyone loves the most. A little about me: I’m a big fan of comics and a bookworm, would love to find a book club if possible. I love board games in any form whether they’re strategic, cooperative, or just chaotic. I am a HUGE movie fan (also avid horror fan), like from classics to new releases it doesn’t matter. I also love theatre plays or a musical if you are into that. I love hiking and camping a lot, and have recently gotten into riding a bike since it’s so big here. In the creative side, I’m an amateur baker and cook, something I’m supper passionate about doing and it has made me become a foodie on the weekends from time to time lol. I’m also an amateur artist and my BIG personal dream is currently to build my portfolio and hopefully get a gig in the city with a local building mural or mural along cherry creek would be awesome. Other than instagram, I just started my online portfolio with CALLFORENTRY to try and find local online bidding gigs, so fingers crossed. Anyways I’m really here because I want to meet people and play games, go on hikes, talk about books, swap podcast recommendations, cook together, or just hang out and build community. If any of that sounds like you I’d love to connect, just DM. Thanks for being a kick ass city and I’m excited to be part of Denver more!",3,1768198991.0,boulder,0,0.64,False
