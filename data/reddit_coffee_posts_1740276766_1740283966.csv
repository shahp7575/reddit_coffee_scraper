1iw1l8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1iw1l8y/thinking_about_writing_a_book_about_my_friend/,"Thinking about writing a book about my friend frank, who dated this special agent girl who ""ghosted"" him. True story. Lemme know your thoughts.","Frank Marshall was an unremarkable man in most ways, but he prided himself on one thing—his ability to read people. A veteran of the sales industry, he had an instinct for sniffing out deception, a skill that had made him one of the top real estate brokers in Denver. And yet, for all his so-called intuition, he had been utterly blind when it came to Natalie Hayes.

They met at a coffee shop on a drizzly afternoon, a meet-cute straight out of a rom-com. She had bumped into him, sending his overpriced cappuccino splashing across his shirt. She apologized profusely, her blue eyes wide with sincerity, and insisted on buying him another. That was how it started—innocent, perfect.

Natalie was a travel consultant, or so she claimed. She had an air of mystery about her, but Frank found it intoxicating. She rarely spoke about her past, avoided talking about work, and never introduced him to friends or family. But when she was with him, she was present—wholly, fiercely present. They spent weekends hiking the Rockies, whispering secrets in the dark, and dreaming of a future that, unbeknownst to Frank, would never come.

One night, she vanished.

It was a Tuesday. Frank had gotten home late after closing a deal on a million-dollar property. The house was dark, eerily still. Natalie wasn’t there. At first, he assumed she was out. Maybe a last-minute work trip. But then he noticed the little things: her favorite red leather jacket was gone, her toothbrush missing, her nightstand drawer emptied. No note, no text, no goodbye.

Frank spiraled. He called her phone incessantly, only to find it disconnected. He checked hospitals, filed a missing person’s report, even hired a private investigator. Nothing. It was as if she had never existed.

The truth came nearly six months later, in the form of a man in a navy suit who appeared at Frank’s office one evening.

“Mr. Marshall,” the man said, flashing a badge. CIA. “I need to speak with you about Natalie Hayes.”

Frank’s blood ran cold.

The agent laid it all out in precise, clinical detail. Natalie Hayes was never a travel consultant. She was an undercover operative for the Central Intelligence Agency, stationed in Denver under an assumed identity. Her relationship with Frank? A cover. An airtight alibi for her real work—espionage, counterintelligence, operations so classified that even now, the agent refused to elaborate.

“She cared about you,” the man said, almost as an afterthought. “That’s why she left. If she had stayed, she would’ve put you in danger.”

Frank barely heard him. His world had crumbled beneath him. The woman he loved had been a ghost, a mirage built on lies. Yet, despite the betrayal, he still missed her.

He still loved her.

And every time he passed that coffee shop where they first met, he couldn’t help but wonder—had any of it been real?

Why not I guess lol. 

I’ve been doing OLD for a while now and while I’ve had a *tiny* bit of success there, I’m sort of curious what cold approaching could bring to the table. 

I don’t like being cold approached at the gym so I won’t be doing it there. I don’t typically drink and I don’t feel safe going out by myself at night/if I go to a bar with my girlfriends, I want to focus on my girlfriends. That being said — I’m gonna try a local coffee shop I’m a somewhat regular at and see what happens. Worst comes to worst I get rejected (or stabbed but hey you win some you lose some) (that is a joke I swear).


Here’s what I already know: 

- Leave the poor workers alone 

- Don’t bother someone who has headphones in/is clearly working 

- Don’t bother someone who is in a group

- Pick up social cues. I tend to over read social cues so if anything I’ll bow out even before a guy has said he isn’t interested because I’ll automatically assume he doesn’t want to be bothered. I like to er on the side of caution. 

- Try striking up a conversation about something they’re drinking/reading (IF they don’t seem busy).

- Subtly “”watch”” (do not stare) to see if they’re busy before deciding to approach

- If rejected, take it with grace

Linda has been posting for 3 months every day, consistently. Just like she was told to do. Her expectations were high. Her results were no sales, no engagement, and a whole lot of frustration.

We chatted for a while, and she asked me to review her social media pages. What I found was a whole lot of random content, with very little helpful content. 

What I mean by that is that when she was tired, she knew she had to post, so she would grab an overused motivational quote and post it. Fast, easy and it made her feel good. But she was getting likes and a couple of followers, but here's the problem. The algorithm was sending her post to people who like motivational quotes, not the services she wanted to offer.

Then I saw a lot of pet images as well as her favorite Starbucks coffee drink; again, this is telling the algorithm to send these posts to people who love pets and coffee drinks and literally have nothing to do with her services.

When I explained why her content was random and not useful to her ideal client, she responded to me, ""My daughter told me the same thing; my content was too random, but she did not tell me how to fix it"".

Conclusion!

Often you think you know what and how to do things. Then, after a while, you wonder why you're not getting the expected results. Then you start questioning yourself and often start blaming the lack of results on the market as too saturated. The social media platform is not good anymore; it sucks. 

But the harsh truth is it's your fault. Not intentionally but often misunderstanding. That's why this subreddit is now here. To help you work through all the issues and start getting the results and outcomes you desire.

I love the smaller scale the plot has for 90% of the game and the cosier feel it has with the cast compared to the other games, the investigation team feels a lot more like a group of friends then 5 and especially 3. P1,P2 are a different type of beast all together.

Anyway as I sit here with my Vita (turned on for the first time in yeeears aswell) it got me thinking each game has the not necessarily bad but less interesting links/confidants which are they in this game?

If we dont count the Hermit right away because well... its not really a proper one is it?
For me Tower comes to mind as cute over all and the ending is nice but lots of the lvls are kind of just ""you studied again"".

And the Sun arcana I know I finished Ayanes storyline once but never again. 
Not because I recall it being awful but I just dont remember anything about it. It left that little of a impression other then she looks like a 5 year old for some reason lol.

And lastly Marie from my understanding she is pretty disliked? It is so obvious she was not part of the original game when doing her link I feel they handled that a bit better with royal. Anyway I am pretty apathetic towards her link neither hate it or love it.

On the other hand we Dojima Nanako who just crushes it (no hate to Sakura and coffee dad but detective dad and sis has them beat)

Am I being dramatic?,"TL;DR: My best friend that I don’t want to let go oftentimes makes me feel like the last on her priority list, but she doesn’t realize it. I want to keep her in my life but don’t want to feel this way and can’t confront her. 

I, (F18), have had this friend (F18) for many years and we’re very close. We’re also very similar in many ways and connect on a different level, so cutting her off is a very difficult decision for me. She doesn’t even realize the things that she’s doing so confronting her is pointless and I will just look stupid bringing up something that hasn’t happened recently. She does these little things that make me feel so small and unimportant in her life. 

Ok so 1.) she tells her boyfriend all my private business. She even admitted it. I can’t say I care too much but it’s the fact she tells him personal things of mine and makes it some sort of gossip session. I expressed that I’m uncomfortable with it and she just said “I tell my bf everything”. I didn’t want to be seen as dramatic so I just shut up

2.)Frugal with me but spends lots of money with her friends. Goes on trips, restaurants, nice gifts, etc, but when we go to a cafe to get a $5 coffee suddenly she needs to save money. I seriously don’t get it. She asked me to pay her back $3 for a bus ticket but randomly bought her bf a $100 gift soon later. We used to spend money together and get food so this behavior is way more recent. 

3.) on my birthday she just told me a short message and she kept track of the date at least but it definitely felt half assed so that hurt. I used to send her long messages and many gifts but she never once bought me a gift so I stopped. She tells her friends how much she loves them on a daily basis but can’t even tell me that on my birthday. My bsf of two years made me feel so loved on my b-day compared to that. 

4.)This one Isn’t a big deal I guess but she’s friendly towards the people I don’t like/who I’ve said talks badly about me. I would NEVER do that to her her enemies are my enemies. She’s up the ass of one girl who frequently talks about me and my friends. I don’t know if she defends me because I never asked she just tells me what the girl tells her

What the hell is wrong with me?,"27M, 6’0 170lbs. No medication, don’t smoke tobacco, and I’ve had this issue for years. At least 3 but it has gotten worse. I live in NYC. 

I can’t live like this anymore. It’s embarrassing, it’s uncomfortable, it’s gross. I don’t even remember what normal gut feels like anymore, it’s a foreign concept. I burp, not joking (might be an under exaggeration actually) 300-400 times per day. I didn’t realize how insane this was until I saw a post on the GERD subreddit where a guy said he burps 4+ times an hour. Absolutely adorable. I burp probably 25-50 times an hour. It doesn’t end and it shouldn’t be possible. It doesn’t matter what the food is. I constantly have air in my stomach that often triggers nausea. What’s strange is that it never comes out as “belching”, as if I’m pushing it out with my diaphragm or as if it’s just empty air. I always have to “force” it out with a swallow type of motion in my esophagus, to bring it up and then release it. 95% of the time, it has a smell. If I tried to “belch” this out, I would either vomit or get insane acid reflux. And while we’re on that topic, I am constantly having acid reflux accompanying this. I basically eat baking soda and tumslike candy and it’ll work for 20-30 mins. Somehow it always comes back: 

What drives me crazy is there is never relief: there is never that burp that seems to clear it all out. Instead, it’s an endless and infinite flow of burping. As soon as I burp, more stomach gas is produced to fill the missing air. I never EVER get relief, never feel that my stomach is air-free. Gas-X doesn’t work at all. Not even in the slightest. Probiotics have done nothing. If there was some machine where I hook my stomach up to a tube and it drains the air out of my stomach I would be using it dozen times a day.

As for my health, I don’t have the most ideal lifestyle but my vices don’t seem to account for the level of gut problems. I use nicotine (Zyn), I drink coffee in the morning. I smoke weed occasionally at night. I drink sodas very rarely. I don’t drink alcohol at all. What I think may be the problem is Kratom. I take kratom everyday and sort of dependent on it. I plan on getting off but I’m wondering if this is the culprit. However, I’ve never heard of this magnitude of problems from Kratom. The most is that it can cause constipation, which may trap gas in my stomach increasing the problem? 

Please, any advice? How do I get my life back? I seriously can’t do this anymore. I can’t keep burping 300-400 times a day; that is fucking INSANE. ",1,1740283234.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

We were going out for coffee while it was snowing, and we saw a homeless man on the corner with a dog. We decided we would get him water and buy him some food if he’d take it. When we gave him the water, he gave it to the dog first. We walked to a pizza place, and my partner gave him his gloves, and I waited outside with him while my partner went in and bought a pizza so that he could stay with his dog. 

While we waited and talked, I learned his last dog had been stolen, and he’d had her for a few years. He always prioritized his dog. He gave her food and water first. He wouldn’t leave his dog alone now because he couldn’t bear to lose another. When he got the pizza, he let his dog eat from it first, just like he had with the water. 

He wouldn’t let us help more than that (we were broke college students at the time so we were limited anyway), unfortunately, but my partner insisted he keep the gloves. I haven’t seen him since, and from what I remember he was passing through. I can’t remember his name, but I think about him and his dog often and I hope they’re ok. 

If you’re somehow seeing this, you were very kind, and I hope the world treats you and your pup better than it has. If I see you again I’d happily help you however I can.

I manage 75 pushups, 400 crunches, 1 minute 30 second planks, and 100 squats. I work out 3-4 times a week. 

When I used to drink soda it was in moderation, one every blue moon. I haven’t even had a can of soda in over six months, so that’s not even an issue. Like I said I only drink water, tea, and coffee. I take medication but as much as I exercise alongside my diet it should offset the side effects.

I’ve scoured the internet on why I’m gaining weight but the search results are all the same; eat right and exercise, so what’s the real problem? I’m looking for answers, maybe Reddit could help. Thanks. ",0,1740283152.0,bodyweightfitness,7,0.5,False

I’m 19, a second-year ESM major and an English minor. I live off-campus, super close to the Arboretum path and right next to downtown.

I live with a couple other close friends and while we have a great friend group we think it would be so fun to expand our social circle and meet some more people. 

Painting a picture of our vibe:

We love to have movie nights (usually movies from our childhood like Disney, Pixar, animated Barbie movies, or random suggestions, like some of my favorite horror movies and the romcoms of my roommates) and we're the type of people who yap through it and rewind to emphasize our favorite parts. We're all neurodivergent in some way or another so we are so happy to listen to your niche interests and swap stories.

We like to pop downtown and eat, I make them look through thrift stores with me, or we get ice cream or froyo(!!!) or something. Our apartment complex has a pool and hot tub and a little game room that are soo fun. Also free coffee dispensers! 

One of my roommates doesn't partake in anything but still has fun being around, so if you smoke or drink we do this too. 

I personally enjoy smoking with other people, especially while sitting or walking in nature observing the wildlife. Big fan of cats and ducks. And worms and slugs and mushrooms and interesting plants. I will be analyzing them and taking pictures until my phone battery dries up way too soon lol. 

I'm also personally a bit fan of goth expression/alternative culture overall and I am very willing to do your makeup or try and find a rave for you etc. Some other activities we are down for include picnics, karoke, bowling, etc. (We can happily introduce you to the friends we already do some of this stuff with). We can also sit in silence doing HW (all STEM majors) and chill. 

We were thinking, if anyone on this sub wanted to meet, we could all meet downtown for froyo and have an environment to socialize and say hi. We just love big chill friend groups and we're trying to form one lol lmk!!

I've never made a post on this subreddit so I'm not too sure what to do but I'm pretty desperate for some advice so here we go.

I (16 F) have had feeling of love to my drama teacher (late 40s M) for about four years now. So I know I love him, but as I grew up with emotionally absent/abusive parents I don't know if I see him as a father figure or something else. He's a lovely guy, so unbelievably sweet and he just gets me, he's been there for me through everything, breaking up with my manipulative boyfriend, helping though problems with my parents, even just day to day chats about music, films, and life in general. He even knows my coffee order and drives me home sometimes, I wish he was my dad and I wish he was my friend. 

Now, I'm just stuck, I know things won't go any further and I don't want them to either. I just want to be loved but I know it's unhealthy to rely upon people to be your comfort like that. 

So for advice, what do you think I should do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated

1iw17jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1iw17jn/accept_a_crappy_offer_for_a_promotion_to_senior/,"Accept a crappy offer for a promotion to Senior in my current role, or decline for a potential chance at an internal job that will be opening soon but not guaranteed to get?     Hope my description below is coherent, there's also other factors at play, but I'm trying to be concise.","I currently work as a system analyst for the lab department at a hospital. I used to work I the lab, they like to hire from the lab vs people with IT background. We deal with several applications, hardware, and software, and end user issues.

Three months after I started, 2 people quit (of a five person team) because they didn't like the new leader. I had essentially no training. This job has a 1-2 year learning curve). My coworker and I basically had to train ourselves from the ground up. Luckily we are pretty intelligent.

After three years, I’m still not doing much of what was sold to me in my interview, more application based work. I spend most of the time acting as a middle man between the lab and vendors and IT bc we can’t actually fix most problems that arise as it has to be done from their end.

I’ve since become interested in working with the Epic Orders/Lab group, Epic is the main EMR application that a lot of hospitals use. I reached out to that manager 4-5 months ago just to ask questions, get a feeling of their day to day. He answered very thoroughly and thoughtfully. In the last month, Epics jobs have been opening as we just had a big merger. Epic manager says more of his department jobs will be posting soon, he needs four more people. I asked if they have ever hired anyone with my background, he said no but that is something that team has talked about as a knowledge gap to fill.

Last week my director informed me that a Senior Analyst position in my current department was opening with my name on it (timing is super suspicious to me, feels like a trap). I applied and received an offer…an increase of about $1/ hr. $35/wk after taxes and deductions. This is NOT life changing money to me. Or even keep me around money lol. I went back asking for 10% vs the 3% they offered and got a hard no from HR. I have until Monday EOD to accept/decline.

MY DILEMA: Take the “promotion” for the title on my resume, and be locked into that role for 6 months, as they don’t let you transfer roles before 6 months, or decline and wait for the Epic jobs to post. I could also use the 6 months to apply outside my organization, but chances would be lower of getting interviews as they want experience. ALSO, I’m pretty sure one of my coworkers is interested in the same job as me.

PROS current job: like (some of) my coworkers we work very well together. Hybrid so I still see old lab coworkers multiple times a week for coffees/socialization, but still have tons of flexibility.

CONS current job: coworkers also looking for new jobs. Not building skills I’m interested in. On call every third week for the last three years. Medical Dr over our team is like a dictator, and works with me the most, i'm over him.

PROS epic job: more applications based work, troubleshooting, I think I’d be really good at it. Senior position of the bat. Fully remote. More mobility with that experience, Epic is everywhere in the country and there are consulting jobs with higher pay.  Slightly higher pay in general than my current analyst job.

CONS Epic job: one coworker is also interested, and has better connections than me. I doubt they would take both of us from our small department. Fully remote (I live alone and get too isolated, I’d have to find a place out of the house to work some days). NOT guaranteed to get it.

TLDR: Accept a 3% promotion in a job I’m not totally happy in, be locked in for 6 months and hope Epic jobs are around in 6 months. Decline promotion to be available to apply for internal Epic jobs and free to transfer, IF I even got it, not guaranteed.

## Design and Comfort: how Do They Feel?

Comfort is paramount for headphones, especially if you plan on wearing them for extended periods, whether for travel or working from home.

*   **Sony WH-1000XM4:** The WH-1000XM4 boasts a sleek, minimalist design. The earcups are plush and provide excellent cushioning, and the headband is well-padded, distributing weight evenly. They feel light and comfortable even after hours of use. The materials are high-quality and contribute to a premium feel.

The earcups are incredibly soft and gentle on the ears, and the lightweight design ensures a comfortable fit for almost any head size. They're particularly good for extended wear, such as long flights.

## Noise Cancellation: The Main Event

Active noise cancellation (ANC) is the core feature of both these headphones.Let's break down how they perform in different scenarios:

*   **Sony WH-1000XM4:** Sony has consistently been praised for its industry-leading ANC. the WH-1000XM4 utilizes a sophisticated algorithm and multiple microphones to effectively block out a wide range of frequencies. It excels in suppressing low-frequency sounds like engine rumble on airplanes or the hum of office air conditioning. It also adapts to your environment using Adaptive Sound Control, automatically adjusting the noise cancellation levels based on your activity.

*   **bose QuietComfort 45:** Bose built its reputation on noise cancellation, and the QC45 continues that legacy. The QC45 offers two main noise cancellation modes: Quiet and Aware. Quiet mode utilizes a potent ANC system that's particularly effective at neutralizing mid-range frequencies, making it excellent for blocking out chatter in coffee shops or the drone of a crowded train. Aware mode allows some ambient sound to pass through, helping you stay aware of your surroundings.

**Analysis & Comparison:** according to some tests, the Bose QuietComfort 45 has noticeably better ANC that outstrips in a range reaching nearly 40dB of attenuation, which means noises in that range will sound one-sixteenth as loud.

**Verdict:** The Sony WH-1000XM4 features a more adaptable and customizable ANC experience with its adaptive sound control. However, the Bose QC45 offers near-perfect noise cancelling in the mids. The choice depends on your specific needs and where you intend to utilize the headphones. If suppressing low rumbling sounds is critical, the Sony may be better. If you require consistent blocking of voices and mid-range noises, the Bose QC45 offers amazing attenuation.

They support Sony's LDAC codec, which allows for high-resolution audio streaming over Bluetooth, providing a richer and more nuanced listening experience. The companion app also offers a customizable EQ, enabling you to tailor the sound to your preferences.

**Verdict:** The sony WH-1000XM4 emerges as the winner for those who prefer a more engaging and dynamic sound. Its punchy bass and customizable EQ provide a more exciting listening experience.

*  ⁤ **Space Optimization:** A **dual monitor‍ stand** effectively frees up valuable desk⁣ space.

By suspending your monitors in the air ⁢with a **desk monitor mount dual**, you reclaim that space for other essentials⁢ like your keyboard, mouse, documents,‌ or even a ‌cup of​ coffee.

##‍ Key Features to Consider When Choosing a Dual monitor⁣ Arm

Now that you understand the ⁢benefits, let's discuss the key features to ⁢consider when⁣ selecting the best **desk mounted dual monitor arm** ​for your needs.

*   **Weight Capacity:** ⁤Ensure that the **dual monitor⁣ arm weight capacity**‍ is sufficient⁢ for ​your monitors. Check the specifications carefully and choose an arm that can comfortably support the ​weight of each screen. Overloading the arm can lead ⁢to instability and potential‍ damage to your equipment.Consider a **heavy duty dual monitor arm** if you have larger or heavier monitors.

*   **Monitor Size Compatibility:**⁣ Pay attention to the monitor size compatibility. Most **dual monitor arms** are designed‌ to accommodate specific screen⁢ sizes, typically ranging ⁤from 24 inches to 32 inches. If you have larger monitors, such ‍as a‍ **dual monitor arm for 32 inch ‌monitor**, you'll need to choose an arm specifically designed for ​those dimensions. Also, it's ⁣quite common to see request for **dual monitor arm for ‌27 inch monitor**, ⁤so always double-check the specifications before making ‍a purchase.

*⁣   **VESA Compatibility:** **VESA** (Video Electronics Standards Association) is a ⁤standard that defines the mounting interface on ⁣the back of monitors. Ensure that the **dual monitor‌ arm VESA ‌compatible** with your monitors. Most modern monitors ⁤adhere to the VESA ‌standard,​ but it's ⁢always a good idea to double-check the VESA pattern (e.g., 75x75mm or 100x100mm) to avoid compatibility issues.

*   **Adjustability:** The level of adjustability is a critical⁤ factor.​ Look for an⁤ **adjustable‍ monitor arm** that offers a‌ wide range of motion, including height adjustment,‌ tilt, swivel, and rotation.‍ A ⁣**height adjustable dual monitor ​arm** is particularly⁣ crucial for maintaining proper ergonomics. Also, consider a **dual monitor arm long reach**‌ if you‍ need‍ the flexibility to ⁣position⁣ your monitors further away. Aim for a​ **fully articulating‍ dual monitor arm** to achieve the most adaptable​ setup for your⁤ unique needs.

*  ‌ **Mounting ⁢Options:** ‌**Desk mounted ⁤dual⁤ monitor arms** typically come with two ‍mounting options: clamp-on⁤ and grommet mount. A **clamp on dual monitor arm**⁣ is easy‌ to install⁣ and ​doesn't require any ⁢drilling. It simply clamps onto the edge of ⁢your desk. A⁣ **grommet mount dual monitor arm** requires⁤ a hole ⁣in your desk,but it provides a more secure and⁤ stable attachment. Consider the thickness and material of⁣ your ‍desk when choosing ​a mounting option.

* ‍  ⁣**Gas Spring Mechanism:** A **gas spring ⁤monitor arm** provides smooth and​ effortless height adjustment. The gas ⁤spring mechanism​ allows ‌you⁤ to easily raise or lower your monitors with minimal effort. This is a desirable feature for those who frequently adjust their monitor ​height throughout ‍the day.

* ⁣ ‌ **Build Quality and Durability:**⁣ Invest in a **professional dual monitor arm** or​ **commercial grade monitor‍ arm** that is built‌ to‍ last. ⁤Look for ‍models made from high-quality materials like steel or aluminum. A sturdy‍ and‍ well-constructed arm will ‌provide‍ long-term reliability and stability.

* ⁣  **Cable Management:** As mentioned earlier, effective **dual monitor ‌arm cable management** is‍ crucial for a⁣ clean and ​organized workspace. Look for arms with built-in cable channels or clips that ⁣can route​ the cables neatly along the arm.

Paying a little extra for a well-built arm can save you money and ⁣frustration in the⁣ long run.

*​  ​ **Read Reviews⁢ and Compare Models:** Before‌ making a final decision,​ read online reviews and compare different models.

1iw0xwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/actualgyaru/comments/1iw0xwy/gyaru_has_always_been_fast_fashion_stop_using_it/,Gyaru Has Always Been Fast Fashion — Stop Using It As a Reason to Gatekeep,"
Let’s get one thing straight: gyaru fashion has always been fast fashion. J-fashion in general has heavily relied on fast fashion because it was designed for teens and young adults, not luxury collectors. Brands like CO&LU, COCOLULU, Liz Lisa, Ank Rouge, and Cecil McBee—all key players in gyaru history—were fast fashion brands. They thrived on affordability, trend cycles, and accessibility, just like today’s fast fashion.

Yet, for some reason, it’s mainly Western gyarus who are shaming newcomers for buying from modern fast fashion brands. This isn’t even a widespread issue in Japan, where gyaru culture originated. It’s frustrating to see people who are trying to break into the subculture be shut down just because they can’t fit into or even find 20-year-old deadstock pieces. Not everyone has access to secondhand Japanese marketplaces or the budget to hunt for rare items.

And let’s be real—most of the clothing people buy, regardless of subculture, is made under unethical conditions. If you own:
	•	A smartphone (made with cobalt mined by child labor)
	•	Chocolate (major brands like Nestlé have been linked to child labor in cocoa farms)
	•	Coffee (many major brands source from plantations with forced labor)
	•	Fast food (many supply chains have been tied to exploitative labor practices)

Then congratulations, you’re already supporting unethical labor. Singling out newcomers for buying modern fast fashion while ignoring the broader reality of global consumerism is hypocritical.

Gatekeeping doesn’t make you a better gyaru—it just discourages new people from joining. Instead of tearing others down, how about celebrating that gyaru is still alive and evolving?",14,1740281616.0,actualgyaru,10,0.79,False

This happened on Thursday February 20 at around 18:15 at the 29 bus stop at the intersection of ohlauer and reichenberger.
For context, I am a young, petite, female presenting solo traveler who does not speak German. I think these traits make me vulnerable to kidnappers and creeps. As you probably know the trains have been on strike this week. Unfortunately, my apple maps shows the buses are running when they aren’t. I’ve just had a nice afternoon drinking coffee and shopping in kreuzberg and my plan to get to my hotel is to take two buses, then transfer to the s bahn at ostbahnof. I walk to the nearest bus stop which was the 29 bus stop at the intersection I just mentioned. I’m sat here for 5-10 minutes by myself and becoming very confused why my phone says there are buses coming when no buses are coming. I’ve been walking all day, my feet are killing me, and I was desperate to get on a bus. A big black van with tinted windows pulls up to the intersection. The driver rolls down his window and says “bus! yes, really!” I was so tired and done with the day that I didn’t process what level of danger I was in. I was irritated that the universe decided to send me a sketchy van instead of a nice and safe bus, and that I would have to walk to ostbahnof no matter how tired I was. Without thinking I made a disgusted face and made a scene. I said loudly how I don’t trust this, this is how people get kidnapped, even if you are the bus I’m not risking my life, etc… I’m lucky that the area was well lit and there were plenty of people around me (not at the bus stop but on the street) who started to turn and look at me and the driver. Eventually he realized I was not getting in his sketchy van and he drove off. It wasn’t until after that I started feeling extreme fear and paranoia because I had almost been kidnapped/trafficked/murdered. Later that night I was googling the neighborhood and I realized this bus stop is sandwiched between kottbusser tor and gorlitzer park which have a reputation for not being the safest areas after dark. My advice for people who enjoy traveling solo is to look up dangerous parts of a city you’re about to visit! I know it seems obvious but I didn’t do this and clearly I should have. Also I haven’t seen any other almost-abducted-by-black-van-in-berlin posts so I wanted to give a PSA.

I've never made a post on here so I'm not too sure what to do but I'm pretty desperate for some advice so here we go.

I (16 F) have had feeling of love to my drama teacher (late 40s M) for about four years now. So I know I love him, but as I grew up with emotionally absent/abusive parents I don't know if I see him as a father figure or something else. He's a lovely guy, so unbelievably sweet and he just gets me, he's been there for me through everything, breaking up with my manipulative boyfriend, helping though problems with my parents, even just day to day chats about music, films, and life in general. He even knows my coffee order and drives me home sometimes, I wish he was my dad and I wish he was my friend. 

Now, I'm just stuck, I know things won't go any further and I don't want them to either. I just want to be loved but I know it's unhealthy to rely upon people to be your comfort like that. 

So for advice, what do you think I should do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated

1iw0tgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Curious-Ebb-8451/comments/1iw0tgk/is_sabais_furniture_worth_the_price/,Is Sabai’s Furniture Worth The Price?,"My mornings are sacred to me — sipping coffee, sitting in the sunlight while listening to gentle music. I’m surrounded by my cat and two house rabbits, and not yet immersed in the chaos of the day. A comfy place to sit is a *must*, and I have recently been redesigning my living room with this in mind.

[The Elevate Sectional](https://preview.redd.it/nsop7gwo4tke1.jpg?width=936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a5a79596bbb3e2cc4c0606a8d335c0158995ff7)

I spent countless hours poring over what I wanted for my room, which is a couple hundred square feet with two right-angled corners on one end, and a rounded half circle of windows on the other. It’s a unique space, and I found myself considering secondhand curved sofas, attempting built-ins, and even foregoing furniture altogether in favor of floor cushions. For reasons of budget, longevity, and general space constraints I couldn’t crack the code of what I needed. 

Yet I always found myself coming back to a brand my colleague reviewed so favorably years ago — [Sabai](https://sabaidesign.sjv.io/nX2GzA). I couldn’t get the brand’s [new sectionals](https://sabaidesign.sjv.io/OemgJW) off my mind. 

What has continued to draw me to [Sabai](https://sabaidesign.sjv.io/nX2GzA) is the brand’s commitment to sustainability, circularity, and simple, modern design. Not to mention how washable and repairable the furniture is — with a cat, two rabbits, and a penchant for spilling everything, I knew I needed a couch that could stand up to my lifestyle. 

>“What draws me to Sabai is the brand’s commitment to sustainability, circularity, and simple, modern design. Not to mention how washable and repairable the furniture is.”

# Why did I choose Sabai over Burrow?

My former Burrow couch, which I purchased in white, was an ambitious idea that ultimately wasn’t a wise choice for a rough-and-tumble person like me (although I managed to clean out most spills). Truthfully, it was a beautiful couch and I spent many hours gaming, working, and catching up with friends on it. But I got rid of it in 2023 during a breakup where I gave up custody of some furniture in the process. New beginnings, amirite?

When searching for a new couch, I actually didn’t want to return to Burrow — not because I don’t appreciate the brand’s design, but because I’ve seen its sustainability initiatives and manufacturing transparency slowly disappear from the site over time. What a bummer.

Sabai, however, has not backed down from its commitments to both people and planet, which I admire! This sustainable brand continues to maintain its B Corp status and eco-friendly initiatives.

*I don’t have human babies, but I can imagine the Evergreen chair would be a comfy (and washable) addition to a nursery.*

Sabai is one of the most sustainable furniture brands I’ve come across, and they’re constantly releasing new initiatives like Sabai Revive (which is a buyback program as well as a marketplace for secondhand Sabai furniture) and Repair Don’t Replace, where you can purchase individual components as you need. The recycled fabrics are untreated and do not offgass, with the Recycled Velvet being OEKO-TEX Standard 100 and Global Recycling Standard (GRS) certified, and the Upcycled Poly being Greenguard Gold Gold certified. If you prefer all natural fabrics, Sabai also offers OEKO-TEX Standard 100 certified hemp on its Evergreen collection.

# My review of the Sabai Elevate sectional and Evergreen chair 

I initiated my search with the criteria of comfort, safe materials, and perhaps most importantly — a couch that was pet-friendly. and While I’m always skeptical about brands I see advertising on social media, Sabai is the real deal when it comes to these criteria, having rave reviews across its site, on Reddit, and of course, from my colleague and friend Kayti.

Feeling convinced that Sabai was the right choice for me, I decided to test out two of the brand’s newer design ranges: the [Elevate sofa in recycled velvet](https://sabaidesign.sjv.io/09dW3R) and the [Evergreen chair in hemp](https://sabaidesign.sjv.io/WyGnLA) (a new material the brand recently started working with!).

# How to order Sabai furniture (and delivery)

I started by ordering swatches to determine which fabrics and colors I wanted; they’re free and ship quickly so you can get to the fun part of deciding what works for you as soon as possible! I also spent several hours with a tape measure and painter’s tape marking out dimensions while I made my decisions.

The furniture arrived in about four weeks from ordering, since it’s made-to-order, and came in seven different boxes which my FedEx driver couldn’t bring upstairs alone. (See below for how creative I got bringing it up to my apartment.) While it was cumbersome, I was pleased to find no plastic in the packaging at all.

>“The furniture arrived in about four weeks from ordering, since it’s made-to-order, and came in seven different boxes which my FedEx driver couldn’t bring upstairs alone.”

“Assembly took longer than expected since it was just me alone; I’d recommend assembling larger pieces, like the sectional, with a friend.”

# Assembling Sabai furniture

Notably, there are no assembly instructions included in the boxes. Instead, you’re directed to a landing page where [all the assembly instructions are available](https://sabaidesign.sjv.io/2aWE37)! I found the virtual instructions to be clear and concise.

Assembly did take a bit longer than expected since it was just me alone, and I’d recommend assembling larger pieces, like the sectional, with a friend. I took two different afternoons to set up the sectional and the chair just due to the physical and mental energy they took.😅 I hit some snags securing the ottoman to the sectional — trying to lift the whole couch and hook up a fastener underneath was no easy task for a solo assembler.

A couple of bolts on the chair didn’t drill as securely as I thought they should, but once the slipcover was on I didn’t notice any abnormality. Perks: All tools were provided, and they were significantly better than the tiny hex key wrenches that IKEA provides — they come with torque handles so you don’t have to work as hard at spinning the bolts into place. I did eventually get tired and popped the hex bit into my drill and used that to speed up the process of installing the legs of each piece.

Once the furniture was assembled, the only smell was the faint odor of wood — pine, maybe? I was able to instantly leap onto the sturdy sectional and take a snooze, and my cat joined me, too. No chemical smell of offgassing here!

>“All tools are provided, and they’re significantly better than the tiny hex key wrenches that IKEA provides — they come with torque handles so you don’t have to work as hard!”

# How does Sabai hold up to daily use?

I’ve now had my Sabai sectional and chair for over a month and in that time, have spilled drinks four times, fallen asleep and drooled on the pillows at least as many times, and hosted several pizza and movie nights with my friends on this couch.

The Elevate sectional is holding up well, and any spills are slow to absorb into the cushioning below so I can usually just wipe clean with a warm, damp cloth. For spills that have a longer time to sit, I bust out my Rug Doctor Pet portable spot cleaner and let the cushions dry in the sun. Overall, everything wipes clean easily and quickly which is perfect for a clumsy person like me. 😅

[I have two rabbits and a cat, and the cat loves to launch herself from the ottoman during her zoomies. You can see faint “scratch marks” from her nails but I find they’re pretty easy to buff out when I’m cleaning.](https://preview.redd.it/mfwxv3n35tke1.jpg?width=882&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a716cb1323b58e5bcf5953b9ae855f73438cd862)

My cat loves to nestle into the corner of the sectional, which gets warm and toasty (but not hot) when the sun hits it just right. And during her morning zoomies, she launches from the ottoman with her extra-sharp nails fully extended. I’m happy to say she’s only left little prints of scratches in the velvet which are easy to buff out with a damp cloth. I’ve had no issues with snags, tears, or holes so far and will update if I do. If you do have cats or dogs, I recommend either the recycled velvet or upcycled poly material, which are both stain- and scratch-resistant.

My late-night work sessions are held exclusively on the cozy Evergreen chair, which is super roomy for a single person and I love the firmness of the arm rests for holding tea and laptops. (I also spend my mornings looking out the windows in my chair while snuggled up with my cat, we can’t get enough of it!)

# Is Sabai furniture worth it? (My verdict: yes!)

Overall, I’d choose [Sabai](https://sabaidesign.sjv.io/yqm053) again in a heartbeat. Each piece gets a top rating from me on comfort; the Elevate sofa is a bit more firm while the Evergreen chair is plush and pillowy, both cozy in their own way.

I will note that, as I’ve experienced with many couches, the back pillows of the sectional have a way of scooching their way down behind the seat pillows, requiring occasional adjustment. This doesn’t happen as frequently as it did with my Burrow or IKEA couches, though! To lessen this, i actually installed the seating platforms one notch higher than recommended in the assembly instructions, so the pitch of the couch is more flat than angled down and back. (The Elevate collection also does have a mildly low back, so if you’re looking for full back support this might not be your cup of tea.)

Looking back, I wouldn’t change the color or style selection of my hemp chair, mostly because I much prefer that chair for reading or working (not drinking wine or coffee) so spills aren’t as big of a concern. Plus, the slipcover would be easy to wash or replace if anything ever got too grimy. The Evergreen chair would make a perfect addition to a reading room or nursery thanks to its generous size, classic style, and cozy warm pillows.

And while I love the navy of my [Elevate sectional](https://sabaidesign.sjv.io/3Jdn3M), sometimes I wonder if I went too dark for my sunshine-y living room. I know the mustard yellow would have been too light but what if — just what if? — I had opted for the stunning amber red? It might have been more complementary rather than contrasting. I will note that you can get slipcovers and replacement pieces for the Classic and the Evergreen collections, so perhaps down the line the brand will also offer upgrades for the Elevate sectional, too. 

A lighter color might have also helped make the rather large sectional appear smaller and less imposing in the space. Sabai furniture, to me, seems bigger than it appears on the site, so pay close attention to the measurements listed! The good news is that this sectional will last me many, many years and accommodate larger spaces if I ever move from my Los Angeles apartment.

When it comes to quality furniture you’re not going to find another brand that meets the same sustainability and quality standards as Sabai for the same price. The three style ranges also offer some diverse price points, with the Classic being the most affordable, then Evergreen, and then Elevate at the most expensive. Payment plans are also available!  

[If you’re on the fence about Sabai — I am happy to vouch for the brand, I can’t wait to snuggle up on my furniture every day.](https://preview.redd.it/z6xulaf75tke1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21ced705f052fd85b4e0711cde189fce72f7798f)

All that being said, none of my concerns are truly dealbreakers or drawbacks. I’m over the moon to host friends in my space with my new furniture, and feel oh-so grown- up with these sturdy, stunning pieces. They make me want to gradually upgrade the quality of all my furniture! 

Overall, Sabai has emerged as an excellent choice for those seeking sustainable, sturdy, and life-friendly (aka washable and repairable) furniture. The Elevate sectional and Evergreen chair have not only met but exceeded my expectations — my home is so cozy, and is getting increasingly difficult to leave. 😆

Feel free to drop your questions in the comments below, and know that I’ll update this review if any important considerations come up in the future. Stay cozy!

# Key Takeaways:

* [Sabai furniture is sustainably manufactured in the US](https://sabaidesign.sjv.io/vPZBrv)*, and is made-to-order so you can expect to receive your furniture in a 3-4 weeks, but check with the brand on shipping times first! While you do have to assemble it yourself, it’s not terribly difficult (I’d recommend having two people, it’s harder alone.)*
* *The upcycled poly and recycled velvet fabric options are great options for homes with kids or pets, as they’re stain- and scratch-resistant.*
* *The new Evergreen series offers a big cozy chair that would be perfect for dens, reading rooms, or nurseries. It’s seriously dreamy and comes in an all-natural hemp fabric.*
* For the price tag, you won’t find a brand equivalent to Sabai’s design, sustainability, and longevity (via repair and upcycling initiatives). I especially recommend for apartment dwellers, although the [Elevate collection](https://sabaidesign.sjv.io/N96ZVV) is refined and spacious enough for a larger living room.",1,1740281210.0,u_Curious-Ebb-8451,0,1.0,False

1iw0s6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1iw0s6k/advice_on_general_direction_for_my_tea_shop/,Advice on General Direction for My Tea Shop Narrative Game in Unity,"Hey everyone!

I'm a complete beginner in Unity, working on a cozy, narrative-focused 2D game about a girl who inherits a rundown tea shop from her late mother. The story revolves around serving tea to customers, rebuilding the shop, navigating grief, and the MC reconnecting with her South Asian culture by turning it into a warm and inviting space selling traditional Pakistani/Indian snacks and drinks. This game is for a school project, and I have till July to get this up and going. I've been working on the storyline and have a list of mechanics I wanted to learn/have in the game. I have little to no game dev experience, but I am a fast learner, and this project is special to me as I'm also doing a thesis/research project for it, as well

I have a few questions as I move forward:

1. First-Person Controller – Since I'm new to Unity, is there a simple, beginner-friendly way to implement a first-person walking/exploration mode for certain game parts? Or should I stick to point-and-click movement or something simpler? I kind of wanted it to follow a format similar to *Good Pizza Great Pizza*,  *that's not my neighbour,* and *Coffee Talk* to start off.
2. 2D Assets – Are there any good pre-made 2D art assets for cozy shop interiors that fit a soft, hand-painted style (similar to *Venba* or *Animal Crossing*)? I'm trying to avoid pixel art. Am I better off making this myself? I've made illustrations using Adobe but would Procreate be a better place to make these types of visual assets?
3. Gameplay Scope – **I want to aim for one day's worth of gameplay for now.** What would be a reasonable amount of tasks/interactions to include in a day while keeping it engaging but manageable?
4. Am I on the Right Track? – Since I'm still a beginner in Unity, does this project seem too ambitious? Would it make sense to build a vertical slice first before expanding?
5. Is Unity the Right Choice? – Given that I'm new to game development, would Unity + C# be a good choice for a 2D, story-driven game like this, or should I consider something simpler like RPG Maker, Godot, or Ren'Py?

So I, 22F have been having issues with my 23M boyfriend. We’ve been together for two years, he moved into my apartment in the fall of last year. We aren’t fighting or anything like that. But I’m basically maid, mother and girlfriend and I’m getting so overwhelmed and tired. He leaves dirty clothes around the apartment. He doesn’t throw away garbage like empty pop cans. I’ve asked him to be better with laundry and throwing away trash but nothing changes. I pay for everything except he pays for half the rent and gives me an extra $70 a month for a total of $400 a month that he contributes to. I had a surgery after Christmas and was out of commission for a week. I woke up after this surgery with an official diagnosis of stage three endometriosis. He is supportive of my chronic disease, thankfully, but really did nothing after surgery to help me out aside from helping me shower and picking up medication. My best friend made me dinner, brought me my favorite coffee, and even did my makeup one day so I’d feel better about how I looked since I am normally dolled up, but was living in pj’s for a week. It was then that I realized how much I do, and how….little he does. Like he truly doesn’t help me out around the apartment at all. We both work full time, and there are no kids involved, just two cats. I had decided this week that I need to have a sit down talk with him, a serious one, and figure out how we can do the household chores together. I was going to do that tomorrow. Well fast forward to tonight…I was on instagram, scrolling through the list of recommended people to follow and a profile popped up of just…boobs. It is a new account, the profile pic is just of a close up on a young woman’s boobs. The only pic on the account is the same as the profile pic. And he follows that profile. The pic was just posted yesterday and the account is labeled as new. I was able to find this same person on Facebook. The only pic on the FB account is the same one as on instagram and was posted two days ago. My BF does not follow her there, just on instagram and he is only one of four followers. I told my best friend as soon as I found the profile. She thinks it’s a bot. She said I should go through my BF’s phone to see if there are any messages between him and the is girl/bot. I have never felt so horrible. Idk what to do. My heart is beating so quickly, I wanna puke and pass out. I don’t wanna go through his phone, that feels so wrong. We know each other’s passwords, it would be so easy. I just…idk what to do. Any opinions would be appreciated. I really don’t want to be in this relationship anymore and this seems like an easy way to end things, but we have two cats and he wouldn’t have a place to live cause his family lives out of town. Please someone just talk some sense into me, I really just need some opinions. What are ya’lls thoughts??

1iw0hh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TedLasso/comments/1iw0hh7/cats_babies_and_apologies/,"Cats, babies, and apologies","Recently my circle of friends has “re-invited” a friend we all had for many years back into the circle. This guy was one of the first people to welcome in The New Kid when we were 13 years old.

From 9th grade up all the way through college this guy was my best friend. Spent many afternoons raiding his parents’ fridge. Many nights playing Dungeons & Dragons at IHOP spending $5 on coffee over the course of four hours. In college he’d crash on my couch after a long night of punk rock house shows.

Then something changed in him. He became distant. And I just thought “well, maybe he’s just trying to find his own way.” We kept in limited contact, maybe a Facebook comment here or there. But really nothing of any significant contact or even friendship

Fast forward another few years and my Dad died. I’m thankful for the outpouring of support I had from my circle of friends except from the one friend I wanted support from the most.

Fast forward to present day (10+ years now) and he’s now back in the fold. He’s gotten his life on track for the most part, quit booze, quit drugs, has a wife and kid, and in the group chat it’s just like nothing ever happened, like he was never a shitty person.

Outside of the chat I mention to a buddy that it feels incredibly weird talking to him in a civil manner as if what happened never happened. How inside of me I need to hear him apologize to me for not being there for me when my dad, a man he knew for nearly 20 years, died.

And my buddy reminded me of a Ted Lasso quote:

“Well, you know my philosophy when it comes to cats, babies and apologies, Coach. You gotta let 'em come to you""

1iw0h31,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iw0h31,Wanting to send this text to my LL after her father aggressively demands that I immediately clean 3 dishes after a long day at work.,"For context: I live in Australia, it’s currently summer, pay $400 per week and live in a 3x2 where the owner/LL, her father and child who is 2-3F live in the same room and sleep in the same bed. They’re a little weird to say the least. 

So this morning I knocked off of my 10 hour bartending and glassie shift. Put my dishes (one bowl, a fork and a spoon) in the sink to clean up after I had had a quick nap. Said good morning to George, the owners father while he is loading up the washing machine before I have a shower. He ignores my good morning. 

I have my shower and as I’m about head to bed but before I could go to bed, he aggressively demands that my dishes need to be done. I said that I have just knocked off of a 10 hour shift and am exhausted and will do them after I have had a sleep. He says no, you need to do them now so we don’t get bees in the house (his English isn’t good so I’m assuming he means flies). I again explain that for the last 10 hours I have been on my feet, carrying cartons of booze, bags of ice, cleaning a bar from top to toe and serving customers for the last 10 hours, I’m very tired and want to go to bed to rest and absolutely will do them after I wake up from my sleep. He still adamant and just keeps saying it over and over and getting more and more aggressive about it and I couldn’t be bothered dealing with him anymore and realise I’m going to spend more time arguing with him than it will take to clean them so I do the dishes. I also do a couple of someone’s dishes that were left in the sink overnight (they were there before I left for work last night as I was filling my water bottle) because I find it petty AF singling out one or two dishes which is what they do - eg if they are washing dishes from cooking a massive feed and if there was say a single cup in the sink that they know they did not use they will make a point to take it out, put it on the corner of the kitchen bench so it’s in full view and leave it there. If I’m out or don’t notice it after a few hours they will knock on my door and tell me I have forgotten some dishes and they absolutely MUST be done right then and there. I find this ridiculous. 

Anyway I try to explain to him that this is unnecessary and ridiculous however he just wasn’t getting it so I gave up. 

I’m wanting to send this text message to the LL because I find it ridiculous (ie absolute bullshit) that they are that worried about flies from a couple of dishes left in the sink for say a max of 6 hours when the kitchen floors, the kitchen bench, the microwave and even the couch and coffee table are always left with food spills, food and crumbs for literal days on end. The kitchen floors at present haven’t been mopped, swept or vacuumed in at least 3 days and are disgusting. The mess is from them and them alone as myself and the other roommate hardly use the kitchen because we don’t feel welcome to do so unless they are asleep or out as George will just hover around. 

Any feedback on how to get my point across welcomed. Im not trying to have a go at them or get out of doing said dishes - I just find this petty, childish and ridiculous for the amount of money I’m paying each week and expect to be treated like an adult, not a child. Also could this be like an OCD thing? That the dishes absolutely need to be done ASAP, or a control method perhaps? Could be overthinking it but I just find it very odd they are so anal about dishes being done but they’re so content with the floors and kitchen bench being covered in crumbs, spills and food for days on end.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Having lived in Queen Anne before, I really miss the coffee scene there. Sure, it was pricey, but grabbing a latte from Lardo or Vita was worth it.

When the pandemic hit, I understood why baristas stopped making latte art—most drinks were to-go, so it made sense. But now, years later, whenever I visit Seattle, I find myself paying $8 for a latte that tastes average with no art in sight.

Sorry if this rant is out of place, but istg it’s actually a bit frustrating to engage with online liberals. Like they freak out so much over meaningless purely symbolic actions like name changes and whatnot. Like I do not need to see another “haha drumpf and Elon musk bad” or “omg famous celebrity said drumpf bad” without actual material actions taking place, like actual wide scale protest movements and shit taking place. Like, why should I give a fuck about these when i dont see actual change happening? It’s like all they know how to do is comment #resistance and do fucking nothing else about it. Like this mentality is seriously one of the most frustrating things about dealing with online liberals. I hate to say the word but it feels like such virtue signaling. Like DO SOMETHING pls istg.

I was fairly successful at restricting since the 20th of January, but today I had a really, REALLY bad full day of binging and gorging on food. I’m so upset with myself because I was doing so well restricting and I had not had a bad binge since the 19th of January. This binge that I had today was worse than the one that I had on the 19th of January. I feel like a disgusting fat pig with no self control. My 19th birthday was at the beginning of this month and I was hoping to make this year completely binge free, but I was fooling myself as usual. I went out to so many places in one day and just got a bunch of junk that I craved and had been denying myself for the past month. I’ve gained like >!5!< pounds. I logically know that a lot of it is water weight and weight from the food, but I’m still really scared. I don’t know what to do now. I cried over this binge. I’m going to try to go back to restricting tomorrow, but I’m really worried about the damage done because today was so bad. Today I went to the diner for breakfast and had a cup of coffee with cream and a large plate of bacon, scrambled eggs, home fries, and four pieces of buttered toast. Afterward, I went to Starbucks and got a venti blackberry sage refresher. Later on I went to Dunkin Donuts and got a chocolate frosted donut and a medium iced vanilla coffee. I also went to the store and bought some stuff and went home and ate at least half of a family sized bag of Lay’s cheddar and sour cream chips, a pint of Ben and Jerry’s mint chocolate cookie ice cream, and an everything bagel with onion and chive cream cheese and smoked ham. I don’t even know if I’m forgetting to list anything. I definitely ate a ton of calories today. I also feel so stupid for going to so many places in one day. I know it probably sounds ridiculous that I went out to so many places. How long will it take for me to recover from this binge and how much damage did I do? I also ate late last night and I had at least >!1,500!< calories yesterday. Before then, I was restricting pretty well for about a month and I was eating below >!1,200!< calories on most days. I’m so sick of messing up after successfully restricting for some time and then gorging on thousands and thousands of calories of junk food and gaining all the weight back. I’m going to try to start restricting again. I know it’s only one day this time and that I haven’t lost all of my progress, but I’m still scared. I’m also worried about what all of the junk is doing to my body. I consumed an insane amount of added sugar and unhealthy fats. I hate that I struggle with binge eating.

1iw07nj,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1iw07nj/which_sa_from_the_costco_selection/,Which SA from the Costco selection?,"Looks like my Miele CM6350 is on its last legs and about to give out (7 years old). 

Use case: On average between 3-5 espresso shots per day, sometimes (maybe once every two month or so) we have guests and it can get up to 15/20 shots for a day or two. Wife likes coffee, so more grounds and super long extraction (6 floz - 8 floz). I generally just get a double shot and throw it into some hot milk. We both like darker espresso/coffee with little to no acidity, so some of the beans we get can be somewhat oily sometimes for what it matters.

I don't really use the milk frothing function on the Miele since the foam is kind of weak and the milk doesn't get very hot. I usually just heat some milk in the microwave and add the espresso to it. I could see a scenario where I would use the frothing function more often if it could produce hotter and/or more foamy milk. 

I would like to buy a new one from Costco since I can return it if I don't like it. So my choices are:

1. Bosch 800 Vero Cafe for $1,600 - I gather this one would probably be pretty similar to my Miele, which is not necessarily a bad thing

2. Jura ENA 8 for $1,500

3. Jura S8 for $2,400

4. Jura WE8 for $2,400 - seems to be more of a small office machine for a somewhat higher use case?

5. Jura J8 for $2,500

The only thing I know about Jura is that they appear to need a bit more maintenance with frequency of cleaning agents, etc. (meh), that you cannot remove and clean the brew units, which can sometimes lead to mold build up inside the machine (ugh), but they make superior espresso once you dialed in your preferences (nice!). 

Not sure what the difference is between the J8 and S8 apart from the J8 having 31 vs 15 options on the S8. But I don't think I would be making use of any of those additional options to be honest.

In terms of technology are the Jura ones all pretty similar or does one of them have newer/superior technology compared to others? Any opinions or recommendations?

I was installing the gauge kit onto my machine and when trying to remove the top pin with the arms it was quite tight on there (just putting my finger on the back wasn't working, it kept twisting the whole axle) and I tried using two 3 mm allen keys to get it off despite most videos only needing to hold the back pin with a finger. I ended up stripping the large pin/axel's threading, but I figure if I can get it off, I can loosely thread it back on like it should be and would only need to use the non-stripped smaller pin's threading while holding the back one with my finger, not needing to replace the stripped part. I'm at a loss how to get this off without drilling into the pin with a screw extractor (which I'm worried will make things worse if I damage the powder coat). I have tried rubber band method and it won't budge. Based on Paul's video here [Cable modification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njEDrwZkSmk) I assume it is normal threading so anti-clockwise loosens. I have the gauge on without the holding clip attached to the lever arm, but if I ever need to disassemble to replace anything like teflon washers or the arm, I'll be sol here. The couple shots I've pulled are great but the stripped screw (my fault admittedly) has put a damper on things today. These are the pics, any suggestions appreciated

The first injury was at his 6 month well check a week before he hit 6 months because we traveled the next week. I had him on the table (stupid high, no straps, hard floor) when the doctor came in and tried to wash his hands, but our stroller was blocking the sink. Kiddo was new to rolling and my brain did not work so I went to move the stroller and the baby fell onto his head in less than 3 seconds. He was ok but cried and screamed for half an hour.

2nd injury was 9 days later the day we got back from our trip. I was running on 2 hours sleep and air travel with a 6 month old (and getting my 75 year old mom to her flight, too) was exhausting. I also managed to leave all the formula at TSA so I was already feeling awesome. I was having the baby nap in bed with me and needed to use the bathroom…again, he rolled off in like 10 seconds. The bed was really low (less than 18” off the carpeted floor) but he somehow caught his lip somewhere and tore his frenulum (little piece of skin connecting your lip to your gums). We went to the emergency room for that one.

He’s now 7 months old. Today, he was just sitting in my lap on the sofa when he leaned forward, fell, and whacked his face on the edge of the coffee table. He has a tiny cut and a red line across his forehead and cheek.

The past week and a bit has been sooo hard. He’s had diarrhea and we haven’t been able to go anywhere so I’m going a bit crazy from that. He’s also in a sleep regression and woke up 7 times last night and napped a total of like an hour and a half over 3 semi-successful nap attempts today, with 2 other long periods of being clearly exhausted but not falling asleep. So I decided to be a bit of a bad mom and let him sit in my lap watching Wonder Blocks while I played with my phone. I guess I should’ve kept an arm around him.

The need to be constantly vigilant with him is so draining. We moved here from another country when I was already pregnant and all my family is on the opposite coast of the US. My husband takes the baby whenever I ask (he works from home, I’m not working for now)but I always feel guilty that my husband isn’t getting enough of a break. Plus he usually just keeps the baby in his lap while he uses his computer, and I know that’s not awesome for the baby for long periods.

The baby also has a giant head, even for a baby. He’s around 50th percentile for both height and weight but his head circumference is 99th percentile. So he’s constantly just toppling over because he has the head of a 4 year old.

I try to play with my baby as much as possible and I’m constantly talking to him and singing songs etc. I love little kids, and of course especially him, but it’s been so monotonous lately, especially since I couldn’t take him anywhere or even feed him new things which was somewhat interesting, but we weren’t sure what was causing his diarrhea so we went back to just formula.

Quick little post because I’ve seen some similar ones that have been helpful, but I feel like a little more specific input would be appreciated. 

So, to cut to the chase my boyfriend forgot to pick me up from work today. He fell asleep, his phone died I guess, and he didn’t wake up on time (12:00pm) to pick me up so I ended up waiting 45 minutes for our roommate to get home and wake him up to get me. (info: 25 f/m, dating 4 years, living together)

I get accidents happen, so why does this matter so much? Because it’s not the first time. Not the second time either. Hell, not even the third time, but it’s the fourth time this has happened. And realistically, I wouldn’t have too much of a problem with “being late” if there were ever any indication he’d be showing up, or if I’d been told beforehand I’d have to wait, etc. but that is never the case. Honestly, it just sucks having to go back into my job to wait and pay for an uber, or two of the times my boss has literally clocked out and driven me home themselves which is incredibly kind of them, but *so embarrassing* for me. Especially to be doing it so “frequently” they’ve started to make comments about how my boyfriend “needs to get his shit together” because my bosses are literally at the point where they joke about scheduling someone to leave at the same time as me on the days he has my car because it keeps happening, which is lowkey kinda mean, but I don’t have any reason to believe it’s not coming from a place of concern at this point. This time I just straight up waited outside for an hour rather than having to bother my coworkers about that. 

On top of that we’re currently sharing one car, my car, while his gets fixed but he’s not employed and does school online so the only reason he even takes my car on days I work is if he says he wants to go get coffee on the morning, so not ever like a necessity. Today he wanted a coffee. He also picked me up, didn’t say a word and hasn’t spoken to me at all. No sorry, no nothing. When I decided to speak to him right now, literally 6+ hours after literally radio silence, he said well you already know I’m sorry and I feel guilty so why bother saying anything, and when I respond with realistically it’s for me not for you, he said “okay fine you win, you win, you win” and literally walked out of the house to “take a walk”.
The fuck?

At this point I’m just incredibly disappointed and feel like this dude isn’t gonna get his shit together because he can’t even do this one simple task that he knows makes me feel really bad and is entirely avoidable on a number of levels. I’m just feeling pretty drained and unimportant, and at this point am really just considering breaking up with him because at least I’ll have a consistent ride home from work. 
How do I even (re)address this? 

tl;dr: my bf forgot to pick me up from work (4th time), sometimes making my coworkers to have to take me home/ change the schedule so I’m able to get home and I’m getting sick of it. How do I address the problem? ",0,1740277909.0,relationships,30,0.5,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I'm going to try and make this not sound like a dating profile, but isn't this what it is anyway? So here are some fun things you should know about me:

* I am an educator but not a teacher, I am all about that programming and making a difference in the lives of those I work with and for.
* I love a wide variety of things, including but not limited to sports (especially men's and women's college basketball and baseball - Yankees baseball is back!), doing bar trivia every week, watching comedies and other non anxiety causing movies and tv shows (my current binge is the always wonderful Taskmaster), going on walks around the city and going to do nothing or read in various coffee shops, diners on Sundays.
* My Judaism is incredibly important to me yet, like the best of us, I constantly struggle with it. I used to go to shul every week, now very much not so much. My ideal shul is one that ins completely egalitarian and traditional and also doesn't dilly dally and is in and out in 2 hours. I keep a ""conservative"" style of Kashrut (Kosher home, dairy and vegetarian out). I am not traditionally shomer shabbat (though my rule is I am observing it by literally not doing any work or things I find unenjoyable).
* I am politically liberal and regards to Israel, I have a great love for the land and its people and also a great hatred of the current government there. I could discuss more about this but also in general politics give me a great deal of anxiety as is...
* I am looking for someone around my age, arbitrarily I generally would say between 26 and 36.
* I want to stay in NYC as long as I possibly can, I love it here and have always loved it here, and it would be great if you were also in this situation.

1ivzqwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ivzqwj/simply_cant_dial_in_niche_zero_ecm_puristika/,Simply Can't Dial in Niche Zero [ECM Puristika / Niche Zero],"I have an ECM Puristika w/ flow control that's about three years old. I just upgraded from a Rancilio Rocky to the Niche Zero. While the Rocky was inconsistent and wasn't getting the most from my lighter roasts, it was pulling fine shots. I started playing with the Niche, and it seems like something is way off with the grind. For one, when I grind at the size in the ""Espresso Fine"" threshhold, the shots are not pulling at all. When I go up to coarser, I can pull a shot in 80 seconds. I went into the coarser range of ""Filter Coffee"" and it took 45 seconds. 

FWIW, I was pulling 19g - 19.5g with the Rocky on one of the finest grinds. With the Niche, I'm pulling 18.5g and even 18g, and still can't get a decent shot out. If you're interested in my workflow, I'm letting the machine heat to 202f / 203f for 30 minutes. I'm grinding into the cup, pouring into the portafilter and weighing it again to make sure there was no retention. I am then leveling with an Asso Jack, and then normal tamp. Since this started, I've been running with the flow control close to neutral and running a steady 9 bar. 

I've also calibrated the grinder to make sure it wasn't off.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.

It's snowing in Florida. Not totally out of this world, but it is rare. What is unusual is the amount of accumulation and how far south it is going. I've been here 20+ years and only once did we have MAYBE a 1/16"" accumulation. 

My county is under a winter storm advisory for the first time in history. Pretty wild. School is open tomorrow though, so I don't think we are actually getting snow. (EDIT: We didn't. Just north of us they did.) How wild would it be to get a snow day in Florida?

January 11th, 1992 was a Friday. I was stationed at Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas pending my discharge in couple of months. A desert environment on the border with Mexico. The desert could get cold at night. It had been cold the night before, and it had certainly been below freezing before, but I didn't think much of it as I turned in for the night. Morning PT had already been cancelled due to the cold, but our first formation at 0730 was still on as far as I knew.

Overnight, the temps really dropped and we got 3 inches of snow according to the historical record I found. So next to nothing for someone who grew up in Colorado, Illinois and Germany. Although I am sure there were [some huskies living there that were thrilled](https://imgur.com/gallery/climate-change-isnt-real-8Q1XBCi), the people weren't. For the city of El Paso, it was extremely unusual. No, it was worse. It was the End Times, and people promptly freaked out as would be expected. 

I woke up, got my day started, got on my uniform and stepped outside the apartment. Boots polished, starched uniform, combat patch, I looked *sharp.* I opened the front door of my apartment on the hill overlooking downtown El Paso. I nearly dropped my thermos of coffee. (Because barracks coffee is shit.) Snow on the ground. Dafuq? I wanted to slap myself awake. I stood on my doorstep, coffee in one hand and keys in the other. I took a sip as I contemplated this white stuff on the ground. It was snow alright. I had last seen it in Korea. Before that, West Germany. Illinois. Colorado. But Never in Texas or New Mexico. In any case, it wasn't a big deal for me - I could drive in this. As I stepped away from my door, I heard my phone ringing (a landline for you dinosaurs like me out there, because this was the very beginning of cell phones and I didn't have one yet), but didn't want to go in to answer it. I walked down the stairs into my private garage (a luxury in apartments, and one that let me keep my TA-50 ready to go for alerts), got the truck warmed up and left for post to go to work.

On the way out, I came upon a neighbor whose car had stalled out. We popped the hood, and I noticed their carb wasn't opening all the way. Amazing - my mechanic experience in the Army was paying off. So I got a screwdriver to pop the valve open while they started it, and it fired right up. It was just cold and needed oxygen, and I showed them what to do if it died again. 

Leaving the apartment complex and heading to post, I saw quite a few accidents. All of them were caused by excessive speed. Everyone seemed OK as I passed and there wasn't shit I could do, so I kept going. My truck was light in the ass end and didn't do great in the snow, but I went slow enough it was OK. I listened to the radio. The airport was cancelling flights. Schools were closing. Police were encouraging you to self-report car accidents the next day as they were overwhelmed.

I finally parked at the unit and walked in. The CO, XO and First Sergeant were in. They were standing around the CQ desk talking. *""Cobb - didn't you get the message?""* Ah, the phone call I didn't take. 

Turned out Fort Bliss had gone to essential personnel only. The rest of the junior enlisted living in the barracks were upstairs, sleeping in after breakfast and being given the day off. So after some more of the Army famous ""hurry and wait"", the CO finally sent the few of us there from off post home for the day. The snow was mostly gone in the late morning/early afternoon, and life returned to normal. 

I get that they weren't used to dealing with it, but that little bit of snow shut everything down. The whole city was acting like it was the End Times. Parts of Florida are behaving that way right now with the snow coming in. I have a mutt who thinks she is part Husky and is loving the cold. (She isn't - she is an American Airhead and Chaos Hound mix.) I do kinda wish we would get snow so she could see it. What really sucks is I'm home sick and have been sick since Thursday. Being immuno-compromised sucks big time. I'm supposed to take two busses of students on a field trip tomorrow, and I seriously don't think I'm going to make it. 

Not a snow day, but a sick day instead. Ugh. Just had some chicken soup, so that always makes me feel (emotionally) better at least.

My head kind of hurt, my stomach kind of hurt, my nose was running a lot and my throat was a bit scratchy. I also felt tired. I drank coffee and felt hungry so I ate a protein muffin, then later at lunch had some leftover pasta from last night and a brownie. IThat filled me up. I have been very constipated so I started having pain and went to the bathroom and had a very hard bm Laid low all afternoon just wasn’t feeling super great. Then felt hungry again and was craving steak. So I went and got some steaks for my gf and I and cooked them with some potato’s and corn. Immediately had no appetite when I started cooking so I didn’t eat my food. Fruit sounded good so I ate some. My gf then started saying she didn’t feel great due to her head and her nose won’t stop running. We just feel run down. Well I am freaking out bc the last time I had a sb* i felt run down and had no appetite the entire day before and also a headache. I remember I couldn’t eat anything and then eventually had stomach cramps and then woke up at 2am and was s*. I am just so scared that these are signs it’s going to happen and I am just so stressed.

Contrary to most dead-bedroom-situations, I’m the one who is struggling with my high sex drive/boyfriends’ low sex drive. I’m super horny all the fucking time - I’m pretty much game to have it literally whenever. I initiate often, but lately I haven’t been as much since I’ve been waiting for him to. He does once in a while, but only when I tell him to, which is frustrating. 

For the record, i know im not ugly; I work out often, am naturally blonde, I have a nice face, feminine but also gritty - I’m pretty outdoorsy and I’ve been a wildland firefighter for the past five years. 

I know he’s attracted to me and thinks I’m beautiful, however his actions don’t display this. We both suspect he’s autistic, so I have confidence that he’s honest and direct with me with anything I ask him. 

When we first got together about 8 months ago, the sex was insane and frequent and we even bought sex straps and some other devices to enhance our experiences in the bedroom. We haven’t even used those, and shortly after the 4th month or so our sex severely declined. 

I love him so much, and sex isn’t everything, but it is a crucial component of a relationship for me and is essential for my emotional connection with someone. Whenever I bring this up to him, he gets frustrated and defensive and basically claims he’s too tired, or we’re too busy and have too much to do, or it’s too late, it’s too early, he hasn’t had coffee yet.. yada yada. I’ve been nice about it; tried to be careful with my wording, but it basically always ends with me sobbing and him walking away and stonewalling me. 

I want to fucking marry this man and I just want to have some intimacy, damnit. It’s starting to feel like a lost cause. Has anyone had a similar experience? If so, is there anything you tried that helped your situation? Thanks. ",2,1740276919.0,relationship_advice,3,0.75,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

1ivzgwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/1ivzgwm/red_cross_donations/,Red Cross donations,"Not a paid promoter, so I unmarked as brand affiliate cuz I don’t want this taken down, but I’m gonna fangirl and infodump enough about how awesome the donation center across from mellow mushroom is and how everyone should go there and why it benefits you- I may as well be one.



Gonna categorize this into groups of info:

1- why donate, for yourself or for others/what do I get out of it and what good does it do?

Save lives, get gift cards, have a steady chart available to show your hemoglobin and both blood pressure numbers. Next month they’re also doing free A1C checks too (basically you donate blood and they can check you for diabetes or pre-diabetes for free which would not be the case with a doctor) they will also tell you if there is a reason your blood wasn’t able to be used (aka if you donate blood and they find out you have a blood disease, they will tell you that you have one, which can save YOUR life.) Also there is a rewards program, and they’re almost constantly running promotions that give you extra points for trying or automatic extra gift cards if you successfully donate. Aka- I donate platelets as often as I can which is basically every week, and get like 200pts each donation plus whatever bonuses, and I exchange 500pts for $10 gift cards plus whatever bonus ones they send me links for as well. I also get snacks every time I go, even if my donation fails. So basically- free snacks, health info, and $10-$20 per month plus extra for promotions they’re running. Also the app has different achievements that are fun to collect, and you can join a team (VT is currently behind UVA…👀)

2- what types of donations are there, what are they like, and what are they for?

There are 4 types that ANYONE can do, then there’s the special AB+ that only special people with that blood type can do (annoys me that there’s an achievement badge in my face I can’t unlock ever 😒)

Whole blood: once every 8 wks. Takes about 15min, can be done at blood drives as well as donation centers. Fastest easiest one to do and only takes one arm ever. 
Power Red: once every 16 wks. Double dose of red blood cells. Longest wait time between donations because red blood cells take the longest to regenerate of all the blood components. This one is important for issues of oxygen circulation, like sickle cell anemia or hemorrhagic shock. Basically the body can’t get oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body because there aren’t enough red blood cells capable of delivering the oxygen, and it can be life threatening, hence why red blood cells are especially important.
Platelets: once every 7 days. This is the blood component responsible for different forms of bodily repair. Platelets hold the coagulating factors in blood and control the fibrin responsible for closing wounds and catching red blood cells to form scabs. Platelets are important for bleeding conditions like hemophilia, and are commonly used to treat cancer patients. Cancer treatments take a huge toll on the body, so it makes sense that repair cells need to be replaced. Also, expect to be there for like 3 hours between the setup, donation time, and getting unhooked and making sure you’re safe to get home. They WILL give you a tv remote and headphones to binge watch whatever you want on the Roku attached to your bed, and there are two ways to do this- one arm or 2. 2 arm is best and safest (for donation purposes), and 1 arm gives you the freedom to get work done on a laptop if you need to. Great way to study imo. Ppl only bother you to check if you’re good, give you snacks, and keep your appt going smoothly. Other than that, they leave you alone. You can study in a comfy bed with unlimited juice or water bottles and they will bring you “fresh out of the dryer warm” blankets.
Plasma: once every 27 days. This component is basically the carrier fluid of blood. You have different types of blood cells floating around in this component like organelles in cytoplasm. This component can be co-donated with platelets without either donation disrupting the “refill” pace of the other. Aka- you can donate both together and still donate platelets 3 times before you donate plasma again. However, donating together DOES make the platelet donation go faster.

3- what if I don’t like blood/needles or I’ve had bad experiences before:?

I have too. Like REALLY bad to the point where I cannot have a needle stick without STARING directly at it as it’s going in because I do not trust that it is going to be done correctly unless I am actively watching every second. Had a Dr mess up once as a kid and completely ignore me screaming nonstop when I should’ve been out in seconds from the stuff that wasn’t going into my vein cuz he was several mm’s off from it and ignored a child pointing it out when it was obvious because what does a little kid know. That plus a Dr messing up my mothers epidural with one of my siblings and doing the same thing tryna gaslight her over HIS fk up. So I have zero trust with anyone poking needles in me unless I am VERY comfortable with that person’s skill and history with ME specifically. I still stare at the needle going in and out, but I don’t mind having the gauze over it during the procedure and I’m able to chill for hours with it in my arm unless something actually happens which is NOT their fault (like if I move my own arm on accident and poke myself too far- which has happened and it hurts for a minute tops while they stop the machine and unhook my arm. No biggie.) when I say I trust these people and I find them to be astonishingly skilled and that they care more about my comfort than I do??? I’m dead serious. Any amount of pain I go through is entirely my choice and usually my insistence to keep going if something isn’t perfectly spot on. They prioritize the donor’s comfort over the donation and borderline fawn over you. I have stories I will happily share in the comments of just how much motherly care and concern they show EVERY TIME. I have had bad experiences but NEVER here. They are PHENOMENAL. As for seeing blood or needles, you do not have to look, they cover the needle with a gauze pad once it’s in, and the whole blood takes 15min. The more hydrated you are, the faster it goes. They also keep the bag below the arm of the chair for whole blood so you literally cannot see it unless you lean over and look down past your arm. And the tube? You can always put a jacket/shawl over it if it bothers you that much, but it really just looks like a curly straw full of cherry juice. Like black/morello cherry, not maraschino cherries. 

4- what about the side effects?

Most of these are self-inflicted by specific conditions we make for ourselves. For whole blood or power red at blood drives, it can freak people out to see someone get up and pass out onto the floor. That’s not actually normal, and usually happens from one or multiple of these reasons:
- didn’t eat for a while before donating. Never donate on an empty stomach. This is literally why they have snacks and tell you to help yourself before you’re even on the donating bed. They want you to keep your blood sugar and electrolytes and hydration up.
- low body mass. There’s a reason they have a minimum for people to donate and an age limit for how old you have to be. They take a set amount of blood (basically a pint), so tiny Human with less total blood volume is gonna feel it more because a larger proportion of their total blood volume is missing.
- got up too fast without any water or juice and/or locked your legs
- multiple donations in a sitting (my sister has only passed out one time from a donation, and it was at a different center where they took a triple platelet double plasma donation all in one sitting, with her consent ofc, but HIGHLY unusual and kind of extreme to do. Nobody falling to the ground suddenly scares me as much as watching my sister turn grey and suddenly go limp in a chair did. She was totally fine but they legally had to call an ambulance to carry her to the hospital across the street, even though she was only out for like 30s or less. Again, extreme donation and only time it ever happened, and it wasn’t here, plus she consented to that donation knowing the risks and she was totally fine. She even laughed it off.)
Pheresis donations (platelets and plasma) come with some other possible side effects due to the fact that they take a longer time, your blood is largely sitting outside of your body, it comes back in with a saline/anticoagulant mixed in, and being outside your body for any amount of time lowers it’s temperature upon re-entry to the body, meaning lots of things. You will likely get very cold, which is why they basically have an oven full of blankets which they will PILE onto you whenever you ask for them. They will continue to blanket you to the moon if you’re cold. You may feel sick to your stomach. Tell them this. They will give you tums because that’s basically your body’s reaction to the stuff they added to your blood to keep it from freezing or getting gummy etc. and you not having enough calcium in your blood stream to handle it. People who don’t like the chalky feel or taste of tums- bring your own antacid chews and/or some good old choccy milk/cocoa. Cocoa will help keep your blood sugar up, warm you up from the INSIDE, and raise your calcium. They highly recommend having calcium rich foods (milk, yogurt, ice cream, antacids, etc.) before and during your appt if you have issues or are worried about having issues like this. They WILL take care of you to the best of their abilities and they are prepared for these things, but these are tips to avoid those issues altogether. Highly recommend the hot choccy. Anyone with a period- iron is an issue for us! It fluctuates a LOT. And coffee (and tea sometimes too) can mess with your iron absorption! Here is a list of foods that are good to help with that around campus whether or not you eat beef:
• southwest steak wrap with spinach (extra spinach if they’ll give it to you, choice of tortilla or bowl doesn’t matter) there’s loads of iron in the steak, plus the spinach, and there’s calcium in the cheese and sour cream.
• Greens and ginger smoothie from Jamba. It’s got the spinach and kale mix full of iron and a lemonade base full of vitamin C to help with absorption. It’s also one of their healthiest smoothies and it’s delicious, with a tart zing from the ginger and citrus. This also helps boost your immunity as well.
• burger 37 in general. If I’m running late, I will order a burger ahead, doesn’t really matter which as long as it’s beef. The iron won’t kick in same day, but there will be calcium in the cheese and if my iron is low, i can try again the next day with the hopes that the burger helped. Again, you can pair this with a lemonade or orange juice, or grab a milkshake for extra calcium and blood sugar but…
- hot chocolate from any of the cafe’s. Squires booth has hot chocolate and milk steamers to give you warmth, sugar, and calcium on your way to your appt. Much better for pheresis.
- soup garden has steak options for salad and lemon and lime vinaigrettes for salad dressings, along with spinach. You can do spinach for iron with or without steak, and the citrus vineagrette will increase the absorption.
- TIME YOUR COFFEE!!! Coffee is fine to drink but can mess up your iron absorption. You need to have it NOT at the same time as your iron rich foods. Think an hour apart okay? An hour before or after. You do not want them digesting together. It’s similar to bananas and polyphenols. It’s why you don’t wanna have bananas in your health juices/smoothies, cuz it ruins the absorption of all the other good for you chemicals under the category “polyphenols” if they’re eaten even 30min apart. Same concept, different interaction.
- don’t diet the day of your donation. I am so serious rn. They have unhealthy snacks for a REASON. You need the electrolytes and sugar. If you have issues, bring something similar that fits your own wants/needs, like fruit or a granola bar. I will tell you they usually have cheezits, two types of medium cookie, mini Oreos, Welch’s fruit snacks, and cheese sandwich crackers, sometimes other stuff. They always have apple juice, grape juice, fruit punch, and water. Eat before your donation or you will not feel good. Let me reiterate- if you do not eat for several hours before you donate, you will more likely feel lightheaded, tummy achey, pass out, or otherwise just #Not-Great 🤨 EAT FOOD. Even if it’s asking for cookies and juice WHILE you’re donating because you realize you forgot to eat, they will hold a juicebox up to your face if you’ve got a two arm donation going. Legit princess treatment because THEY WANT YOU TO BE COMFORTABLE!!!! 

5- why are you this interested/happy about THIS particular center?

I can never talk enough about how skilled Lucy, Jacob, Kat, and the rest of the team are. Like- I’ve had HORRIBLE experiences with other donation centers (never go to Red Cross fairfax Va. ever. Gave them 3 chances, and they managed to make each experience exceptionally uncomfortable even if I didn’t even make it to the donor bed. I will only ever go to INOVA up their because that center has a complete lack of competency and attentiveness that this team here in blackburg has in SPADES.) I actively look forward to my donations because it is the vibe equivalent of a warm hug and a cup of hot choccy in a snuggly soft blanket I kid you not. Like- most of the team is moms. And then there’s Jacob. There is legit nothing to be embarrassed about with those questions, they feel bad having to ask if you’re eating or you just did the pass like 5 minutes before (ah yes, I went to jail for solicitation in the past 20 minutes and spent a consecutive 48 hours there because I’m a time traveler with nothing better to do- they’ve got a good sense of humor so you can give them a sarcastic answer then and be straight up and they’ll input your real answer and laugh at ur joke.)



Anyways!!! If you have any other questions I am BEYOND happy to share!! This is legit how I find my own personal fun stuff without a job. I don’t have time or energy for one, but this works as multitasking. I get to sit in a bed with blankies and juice while binging Netflix or doing homework, then I get rewarded for it. :3 ",3,1740276825.0,VirginiaTech,0,0.67,False

I started my sugar free journey in July 2024 - a 30 day challenge. I got through most of it without cheating (I recall one ice cream cone and a few glasses of wine). It was a steep decline from what I normally ate (candy a few times a week, sugar in my coffee and white bread a few times a week). From July to December I largely stayed sugar free. I enjoyed sweets on occasion, I did not completely cut it out but I dropped 15 pounds pretty easily (and I was already a healthy weight).

Since the new year I had to have an emergency  surgery and was off my feet and ate a few more sweet treats out of boredom. Still somewhat disciplined but not like before. I am on vacation right now and have been having a sweet treat or two each day and I feel my sugar free life slipping from me. I am writing here to make myself accountable again. I really enjoy life sugar free and am excited to return to it.
