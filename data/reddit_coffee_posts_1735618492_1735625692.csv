I usually don't have a problem with my safe foods (which is a lot of foods) and enjoy eating things I like. I have disordered eating, but it's usually not the food itself, it's the act of feeding myself because I have depression and so I see it as a chore and procrastinate doing it.

About a week ago though, I started feeling a sudden disgust for most foods. I was very fond of making tacos and veggie burgers, but now the thought of the ground beef in the fridge gives me an uneasy feeling. I don't gag at the thought of food but I feel a bit unsettled?? It's been a stressful time because of the holidays and the OCD flare-up, but I've never experienced this before and it's scaring me. 

I've been hungry for days now because I can't get myself to eat or make a proper meal. I've been eating random stuff at work (mac and cheese, pasta, milkshakes, coffee, and protein bars) out of necessity.

And when it comes to choosing a brokerage, two fintech cubs—**Moomoo** and **Tiger Brokers**—are roaring for your attention. Both promise sleek interfaces, low fees, and enough stock market data to make Warren Buffett’s head spin. So, who’s the king of the jungle in 2025? Let’s break it down, with a pinch of humor and a bucket of insight.

[moomoo vs tiger](https://preview.redd.it/ed64uarmi4ae1.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b6bc28e155383a3efd751aef501b8523efc8cdf)

# 1. Fees: The Clash of Cheapness

**Moomoo**:

* Commission: Still at **$0**, because Moomoo knows broke millennials are their bread and butter.
* Hidden Fees: Foreign stock trading incurs minor currency conversion fees, but hey, nothing’s truly free—except their constant promotions.

**Tiger Brokers**:

* Commission: Competitive, with **$0 for U.S. stocks**, but international trades come with a small bite (think **0.03%-0.08% per trade**).
* Miscellaneous: Slightly higher fees for forex trading and leveraged products, which could make your wallet purr with disappointment.

**Winner:** Moomoo edges out Tiger by a whisker in cost-effectiveness, especially for budget-conscious traders.

# 2. User Interface: Beauty vs. Beast?

**Moomoo**:

* Bright, playful, and packed with quirky features like emoji reactions to earnings calls.
* Data overload? Definitely. Charts, heatmaps, and sentiment analyses galore—but beginners might feel like they’ve walked into an algebra exam.

**Tiger Brokers**:

* Sleek, professional, and less overwhelming.
* Its minimalist approach appeals to traders who prefer functionality over fireworks.

**Winner:** Tie! Moomoo for the adventurous, Tiger for the Zen-like.

# 3. Community and Tools: Where Traders Gather

**Moomoo**:

* A buzzing in-app community, where traders share memes, strategies, and occasional heartbreak stories about missing Tesla's 20x run.
* AI-powered tools are solid, predicting trends with creepy accuracy, but don’t forget to double-check before YOLOing into the next meme stock.

**Tiger Brokers**:

* More subdued community vibes, but with top-notch research tools aimed at serious investors.
* Integration with financial news platforms gives you fewer memes, but way more clarity.

**Winner:** Depends on your vibe—Moomoo for the social butterflies, Tiger for lone wolves.

# 4. Global Reach: The Great Safari

**Moomoo**:

* Expanding aggressively, now covering the U.S., Hong Kong, China, Singapore, and Europe.
* Great for retail investors diving into global stocks, ETFs, and ADRs.

**Tiger Brokers**:

* A bit more polished in its international reach, with support for more markets and assets like futures.

**Winner:** Tiger takes the global crown, but Moomoo is catching up fast.

# 5. 2025’s X-Factor: AI and Beyond

Both platforms are riding the AI wave, but they’re surfing in slightly different directions:

* **Moomoo** integrates AI into its community, offering real-time trend analysis and stock alerts that could rival your morning coffee in wake-up efficiency.
* **Tiger Brokers** focuses on AI-driven portfolio management tools, perfect for investors who want less trading stress and more zen vibes.

**Winner:** Moomoo’s AI feels like a party trick, while Tiger’s is a serious investor’s Swiss Army knife.

**Moomoo vs. Tiger Brokers: 2025 Comparison Table**

|**Feature**|**Moomoo**|**Tiger Brokers**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Commission (U.S. Stocks)**|$0|$0|
|**International Trading Fees**|Minor currency conversion fees|0.03%-0.08% per trade|
|**User Interface**|Bright, playful, feature-packed|Sleek, minimalist, professional|
|**Research Tools**|AI-driven trend analysis, heatmaps|Extensive reports, integrated news platforms|
|**Community**|Active in-app community, meme culture|Subdued, serious investor focus|
|**Global Market Access**|U.S., Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Europe|Broader market access with futures and forex|
|**AI Integration**|Real-time alerts, community sentiment tools|Portfolio management, trade optimization|
|**Mobile App Experience**|Packed with features, may overwhelm beginners|Streamlined and intuitive|
|**Target Audience**|Retail traders, beginners, social investors|Advanced traders, global market enthusiasts|

**Summary:**

* **Moomoo** is perfect for those seeking a vibrant, feature-rich platform with an active community.
* **Tiger Brokers** is ideal for traders who value professionalism, global reach, and detailed research tools.

1hq8c3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/1hq8c3e/amazon_echo_products_are_a_struggle_to_use/,Amazon echo products are a struggle to use outside US,"A few years ago, we were gifted an Amazon Echo, and this month, we were gifted an Amazon Echo Show. Me and my family have failed in attempting to use both of these devices due to app country locks and struggling with awkward pauses/misunderstandings.

Here’s what I’ve experienced:

1. **Handsfree music -** Sounds great—until you realize it doesn’t work in every country. Tried it in Ukraine, and surprise, “the song app isn’t available in your region.” It does work in India - but it will misunderstand the title, its way easier to just search and tap in a phone.
2. **Handsfree calls -** Sure, if you want every single person in the room to mute their devices, stop talking and overhear your conversation.
3. **Setting alarms/timers -** I can do that in two seconds on my phone rather than struggle with alexa to figure out what I said.
4. **Adding to a shopping list -** WhatsApp works just fine for that. Plus its easy to show and share this list with other people.
5. **Weather queries?** Cool, I can see that in my phone by one tap without even unlocking it. Googling things are a hassle too.

Now, the Echo Show adds:

* **Video or pictures:** Great idea in theory, but guess what? YouTube’s in-browser controls are a pain, and the photo app is only available in specific 7 countries outside US (checked this in Philippines and India). Why are basic features restricted like this?
* **Smart home stuff:** Yeah, we don’t have a smart fridge, microwave, coffee maker, or even smart bulbs. So, what’s the point?

My parents are pretty tech-savvy—they’re always connected with their phones, smartwatches or laptops, chatting with friends, watching reels, browsing videos or working. We tried to make these devices part of our daily lives, but **everything they do is slower, clunkier, or just plain unavailable** in our country.

The Echo was fun for five minutes as a trailer for what the future looked like back in 2022, it was curious to see it struggle with commands, now its just annoying. Even when we try to make it useful, the awkward pauses, misunderstood commands, and repeated phrases - By the time Alexa figures out what I said, I’ve already done it faster on my phone.

Honestly, these things feel more like “cool tech gimmicks” than practical devices - especially in India - where we will be soon. What am I missing here? Which use cases (in India - keep country locks in mind) sets it apart and would justify changing behaviours from using Laptops and phones?",1,1735624841.0,amazonecho,0,1.0,False

**Nalewka is the name for traditional Polish liqueurs, made by infusing fruits and spices in whole grain alcohol. For this recipe, you need to use sour cherries (pie cherries). These can be found in the frozen fruit aisle, but the results are better if you use fresh fruit. Fill a mason jar nearly to the top, then combine whole grain alcohol (everclear) and water in equal proportions to attain a 50% strength alcohol. Add a half cup of sugar to the cherries, then pour in the alcohol. Set it on a windowsill to infuse for three months. Filter the liquid through coffee filter paper, then pour the Nalewka into bottles. Place in a dark cupboard to age for three months. I made this in Aspen and drank it at the Maroon Bells.**

Could you recommend an easy to use bean to cup machine with good quality for a budget until approx 500$?

They do not really need espresso or any fancy kind of coffees, more like traditional americano - as both like their coffees with different strengths it would be better to use the machine per cup and if possible to manually choose the intensity or strentgh of the coffee.

Since then, I’ve had a severe loss of appetite and I’m nauseous when I try to eat. I mainly can only eat smoothies, fruit, granola bars, and little snacky type things in general. If I’m absolutely *starving* i can manage to eat “real food”, but even then not as much as normal. I thought this was because of my dizziness, but a lightbulb went off in my head about the caffeine of it all.

This is a roughly 1960’s, 50 cup coffee carafe. Works great usually, but I’d noticed an electrical burning smell and it’s stopped working.

Please help me troubleshoot :) I have testers, and some basic soldiering and electrical understanding, so I figure this should be fixable. The plug in is reversible, and I’m wondering if it was plugged in backwards if that couple have caused an overload on the one side of the circuit? Or maybe just old.

A few days after I got home, I texted her asking how her finals went and we had a brief conversation about that and how break was going in general, and then she hasn't replied to my last text for days. I'm not sure if it's because she's starting to lose interest or if it's because I just said something that doesn't prompt a response or whatever.

I can't read her at all because she takes a long time to reply to my texts and she's been like this from the get go (always takes hours, if not a day or two to respond), but whenever she does reply she seems interested and keeps the conversation going. 

I won't be seeing her until February because my school as a J term type thing, and I'm not sure how to go about this to maintain contact over break, or if I should even text her at all since she never ended up replying to my last messages.

They are very traditional and it is a generational home, so my sister, nieces, uncles, grandparents, we all lived together and helped each other out but, after my grandfather died the dynamic changed and I felt ""forced out"". I was honestly planning/hoping to move in with him eventually but I had only been dating him for about four months and I wanted to wait, discuss future plans, and just make sure we were both on the same page before doing that.
The grief of our patriarch dying, who was the glue to our family, did have an impact on my falling out with my family members but I've been trying to maintain constant contact for my nieces if anything, (I've always been the other glue so I don't understand why I was the one to be pushed out but that can be another post). Anyways, my bf being who he is, let me stay with him no questions asked but always defending me if I vented. He was raised in a generational traditional home as well, even though when we met he had been renting a house but moved in with his parents once they moved to the city he was deployed/working at to help support his parents and siblings plus cheaper rent.
I was working when I moved in with him but after about a year we discussed me going back to school and I agreed to be a ""stay at home gf"" if he would help me finish my BA degree and help with the finance of it. All of this is fine but lately it feels like there has been a build up of tension and miscommunication. 
After the first year of living together, which for me is the first time I've lived with a man/partner, I've been feeling like the general expectations of what a couple should do to keep the passion alive is slowly dwindling. I have school during the day and he goes to work which is fine but I also upkeep our studio and help his mother with cleaning and cooking etc, and I know he has hard weeks and gets exhausted and I'll let him eat, sleep and then get back at it without having to worry about anything else. But at what point does it become a problem where he goes to work, comes home, eats my food, then just drinks and passes out. And even on his weekend days when I want to at least go to the park, or for coffee, or dinner, he literally drinks and sleeps the entire weekend and I'm left alone. If it was just one weekend or evening, I wouldn't be as upset but I feel like he's comfortable just knowing I'm here, always going to be here, and he doesn't have to try anymore like he did in the beginning 🥺.

My wife doesn’t like coffee. No matter what I’ve had her try she never cares for it. She has found she likes mochas (specifically from Starbucks, I know, I’m sorry.) usually as Frappuccinos which I know are way sweeter than any hot drink.

I’m trying to find anything that I can do/try that could give a better hot drink experience for her without it legit just being a flavored hot chocolate.

Ever since getting my machine and getting into lattes and making my own flavor combos I’ve been dying to share the experience with her outside of making hot chocolates.

I usually do double shots of espresso for my drinks which I know aren’t going to go well for her palate. I’d be willing to bet even a single shot of espresso may come across as too much “coffee” flavor.

So, has anyone else run into a similar “problem”? What was the fix? Single shot of espresso and halve it? Something simpler like a bit of pour over or filter coffee instead? Obviously more milk, but is there anything that can mask the “coffee” flavor?

They are for a limited time **offering 1,000 points to new sign ups** who create an account using [**this link**](https://virginred.mention-me.com/m/ode/bp7rh-alkesh-meghani) and make any qualifying purchase (of any amount!) through a partnered retailer

I just made a purchase on Ebay, which i was going to make anyway!!! (Just make an eBay purchase of £1/+ and it will work!!!)


>You can also then get **another 10,000 points** by referring 10 friends :)!


###Examples of what you can spend your points on:



Greggs Sausage Roll - 200 points each



Greggs salad or Gourmet baguette - 500 points each



£5 Costa coffee gift card - 1,000 points each



Vue cinema ticket - 1,350 points each



£20 Pizza express gift card - 4,000 points each




Virgin Wines £25 gift voucher - 5,000 points (So you could potentially get 2 crates if you refer 9 people after you sign up)



Nike £30 gift card - 6,000 points each



You can also redeem points against flights taken on Virgin Airlines.

Before I started working at the gas station, I would’ve assumed there were two types of people: the normal ones and the weirdos. Especially early in the morning, I would’ve wagered that the people coming in were either just ordinary people (coming home from night shifts or on their way out for the day) or up to something sketchy. 

I was wrong about that. 

It’s a spectrum, I think. Like, sure—there are people who drift in just filling their tank and grabbing a Red Bull before they take off on some multi-hour road trip. There are people who come in, slipping lighters into their pockets or tucking beef jerky into their bags. I turn my eye at that; I don’t get paid enough to risk my life for this place. Especially not when I was stuck in their standard-issue polo that always smelled like gasoline, no matter how many times I washed it.

Anyway, though—the spectrum. There were normal people, and people who probably had knives in their back pockets, but most people were somewhere in between. The ones that looked normal, but, in the early morning hours, came undone. Let the mask slip. Office workers who stayed out on all night-benders, school teachers with god-knows-what in their trunks—after a while, it all started to blend together. 	

So, all that was to say I thought nothing of the woman who walked in at ten after six in the morning.

She was about my age, maybe a little older, and looked a bit like she was coming off a rough night (bags under her eyes, smeared makeup around her eyes like she’d been crying, hair raked back with a tie), but she had also cleaned up well enough with a fresh white t-shirt and a pair of sunglasses resting on her forehead.

“Washroom?” she asked, and I reached down and handed her the key.

She walked toward the back, and I kept thumbing through the daily newspapers that had just been delivered to the counter. Ever since the events of the winter, I’d kept my eyes glued to the paper like a hawk. From the headlines to the classified, I scanned every inch of the black and white print. 

My theory was this: if the magic that Roy Fisher claimed was here was really returning, then there had to be signs. So far, there was nothing I had seen that screamed ‘magic’, and there was nothing in the papers that couldn’t be explained through other means. 

I flipped to the next page of the local news. Scanning it revealed a road closure, a local hockey team raising money for charity, and a review of a play that opened on the weekend. Nothing about strange sightings or unexplained events.

Again, I flipped the page. I didn’t mind spending my mornings this way (especially not after I choked down a cup or three of the horrible burnt coffee); flipping through the morning papers was something like a meditation. I kept my breath deep as I flipped. I let the articles slip through my mind like a mantra of *ordinary, ordinary, ordinary.* 

Whenever I didn’t find anything (because I’d never find anything that would spell it out as simply as to say ‘Hey, idiot—magic is back’), I would put the newspapers on the stand and let my breath go back to normal as I started with my tasks for the day. Papers in the morning, online forums before bed. It worked well enough as a way to keep my ear to the ground for news.

Finally, I flipped to the back of the local news. Again, like always, there was nothing. I set the paper down and sighed out. Though it was still early, the sun poured in through the windows and set the store ablaze. It was the perfect angle to strike right in my eyes, but I didn’t mind the warmth of the sun after the cold winter we’d had. This time of day was also particularly good, since it wouldn’t be too hot yet. 

I pushed my hair out of my eyes. It was getting a little long, and the fact that I didn’t have a chance to shower (thanks to Art’s bathroom hogging) did nothing to help the way my hair sat on my forehead. 

I started to step forward. Some swished around my foot, and the sole of my shoes slipped over the slick surface of the yellow-white tile floors.

A puddle splashed up against the counter. It was just a thin layer of water—like a light layer of frost on a winter morning—but it definitely hadn’t been there a moment ago. I hadn’t been reading the paper for that long. 

Faint trickling hit my ears. I paused and turned my head toward the source—the bathroom. Clear water gushed out under the door. “Shit,” I muttered and rushed toward the door. 

I pounded my fist against the wood. “Um, hello? Are you alright?” I didn’t want to kick in the door (I really didn’t even want to bother this woman at all) but I hoped she wasn’t hurt.

“Hello?” I tried again. The cold water knocked against my shoes and soaked through to my socks. I shuddered. 

More and more water gushed out under the door—it pooled in a decent two inches now. 

There was more water than there should’ve been; the realization crept like a spider up my neck. Pristine water, freezing like a glacial lake, kept pouring into the gas station. Something wasn’t right.

I sunk my teeth into my bottom lip. I didn’t need to scour the papers for magic—it had found me all the same.

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!emotional abuse, bullying!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/s/fN08hY1mo2)  **Dec 18, 2024**

So I have posted a story on here before and I got some pretty good advice so please help. Here’s what happened. I (27F) have always had a complicated relationship with my family. They’ve always been the type of people who think any joke is fine as long as someone laughs, no matter who gets hurt. Over the years, I’ve tried to brush it off and not let it bother me too much, but this time, they crossed a line I can’t ignore.

Recently, I achieved something big in my life: I bought my first home after saving for years. It’s something I worked incredibly hard for sacrificing vacations, nights out, and basically anything extra to make it happen. I was beyond proud of myself and excited to finally have a place to call my own. Naturally, I wanted to share this milestone with my family, even though our relationship has always been rocky.

A few weeks ago, we had a family dinner to celebrate my new home. Everything seemed fine at first, they congratulated me, asked about the house, and seemed genuinely happy for me. But halfway through the night, my brother (30M) and sister (25F) handed me an envelope. They said it was a ""surprise"" to help me with my house.

I opened it, and inside was what looked like a legal notice stating that my house purchase had been canceled because of a ""clerical error"" and that it was now being sold to someone else. It even had an official looking letterhead, my name, and details about the house. I was in complete shock.

Everyone around the table started laughing, and my brother yelled, “Gotcha!” Turns out, they had faked the letter and thought it would be hilarious to see my reaction. I burst into tears, which only made them laugh harder. They even recorded the whole thing on their phones to post on social media.

When I finally managed to speak, I told them how cruel this was. Buying this house was the biggest thing I’d ever done, and they turned it into a joke at my expense. Their response? “You’re so sensitive. It was just a prank. Lighten up!”

I left the dinner early, completely heartbroken. A few days later, I decided I’d had enough. This wasn’t the first time they’d pulled a “prank” like this. Over the years, they’ve humiliated me countless times once ruining a job interview outfit by “accidentally” spilling coffee on it, another time pretending to lose my dog just to see me panic.

I cut off all contact. I didn’t make a scene, I just stopped responding to messages, blocked them on social media, and declined invites to family events. Now, I’m getting guilt-tripping messages from extended family saying I’m being selfish and tearing the family apart. My mom even left me a voicemail crying about how much she misses me and begging me to come back.

But I can’t bring myself to forgive them. This prank felt like the final straw, and I don’t see how I can trust them again.

So, Reddit, AITA for cutting off my family over this prank?

**TOP COMMENT**

**BestConfidence1560**

>You’re rightfully upset because it wasn’t a prank. It was bullying. The “it was just a joke” bs is something every bully does to justify humiliating people.

>They thought it would be fun to upset you on your big night and then take videos of it and post it on social media? 

>And your mother is crying that she misses you?  No she had an opportunity there to rip them a new one about their behavior and about treating you with kindness and respect, and she thought it would be better to go along with the prank.

>You deserve better than this. I’m glad you finally decided to call an end to their bullying.  Don’t let them or any extended family members Pressure you into doing anything you don’t want to do.

>I’m sorry that they couldn’t just be happy for you for your achievement. 

>Congratulations on your new home.

>Wait to add: thank you for the kind awards. I just hope OP gets some measure of peace from these people. She has earned it.

**OOP Updated the post Dec 22, 2024**

**Edit: Thank you all for the advice and support. I wanted to provide an update because things have escalated in ways I never expected.**

After I went no-contact with my family, I thought they’d eventually accept my decision and move on, but that hasn’t been the case. For the past few weeks, my brother and sister have been trying to get me to “see the funny side” of their prank. They’ve shown up at my house uninvited multiple times, banging on the door and demanding to talk to me. At first, I ignored them, but it became clear they weren’t going to stop.

One evening, I caught them standing outside my house with their phones out, recording themselves while yelling things like, “She can’t take a joke!” and “Let’s see how long she can hide!” It felt more like harassment than an attempt to reconcile.

The final straw came when I discovered my car had been egged overnight, and my security camera caught my brother and sister doing it. I confronted them through text, telling them they’d crossed a line and needed to stop. Their response? “You’re so dramatic. You’re going to laugh about this one day.”

At this point, I realized I couldn’t handle this on my own. I went to the police and filed a report for harassment. They took my statement, reviewed the footage from my security camera, and agreed that this behavior was unacceptable. My siblings were contacted and warned to stay away from me.

Their reaction? More mocking messages, calling me a “snitch” and accusing me of tearing the family apart. Some of my extended family members are siding with them, saying I should’ve just talked it out instead of involving the police. But others, especially those who’ve seen the footage, are horrified and fully support my decision.

I feel a mix of relief and sadness. It’s hard to accept that my own family could treat me this way, but I also feel safer knowing I’ve taken steps to protect myself. I’m focusing on building a new life in my home and surrounding myself with people who respect and support me.

To anyone out there struggling with toxic family dynamics: You’re not alone, and it’s okay to set boundaries to protect your peace. Thank you for giving me the strength to stand up for myself. ❤️.

I have a remote internship and 3 online classes over winter break as well so that takes up a lot of time. A few months ago I made a new friend, she’s a very sweet girl, however she CONTINUOUSLY asks me to hang out and I keep declining… idk how to tell her to stop. I find myself thinking “Life is so chaotic and busy, why would u even ask me to hang out”… I know it’s not right to think that way cuz she genuinely just wants to spend time with me, but I can’t help but get angry at how ignorant she can be to the fact that people have such busy lives, I am not available everyday to hang out, so why would u put me in the position to decline ur offer. I feel like I just need some solitude, no school work, no phone, just a book, a canvas, a paint brush, some good food and some jazz. I know deep down I need a mental break but physically I don’t feel i am pushing myself hard enough to deserve a break and this constant battle is infuriating me and i am taking it out on others.

In this vast world, there's a space where hearts come together to build something beautiful—a space where love blossoms into a family, and warmth fills every corner of the home. I believe in that dream with all my heart, and I'm searching for someone who shares that same vision.

I’m looking for a partner with whom I can create a life that’s rich with tenderness, laughter, and the everyday magic of family. Imagine waking up to the soft glow of morning light spilling through the kitchen window, the smell of fresh coffee, and the quiet comfort of knowing we’re together, building something lasting. I envision days full of meaningful conversations, shared dreams, and adventures big and small. I want a home that feels like a refuge, a place where love is abundant, where children’s laughter echoes in the halls, and where every room holds a memory we’ve created together.

I believe in building a family on trust, kindness, and the simple joys of life. Let’s create a home where we’re each other's safe place, a refuge from the world, where love is the foundation, and our hearts are always open. Whether it’s cooking a meal together, watching the sunset from the porch, or snuggling on the couch after a long day—these are the moments that will make our family rich in love.

If you’re someone who believes in the power of a warm, loving home and is ready to build a future where every day feels like a celebration of the life we’ve chosen, I can’t wait to meet you. Let’s create something beautiful together.",2,1735621211.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I had spent 12 hours in some sort of chess prison, I was still there.  

However, it wasn’t exactly a prison. It was this very colorful, and actually amazing place, full with all sorts of chessboards and chess items in bulk, that I had never seen. It was like a chess Disneyland. However, I was there trying to find an escape from my situation, which was being represented both by the environment I was in, and the actions I was taking on my phone. My phone and laptop had been hacked, some script was preventing any browsing, and it was being demanded of me to send naked pictures of myself, my friend Kebo had told me that it was a fairly simple task and nothing one should worry about, I think on a phone call, as he wasn’t there.  I tried googling what to do, and the instructions from the hackers appeared, if I was a male, it said, I was to send a picture of myself either with a special type of robe, or with blue leggings, nothing underneath besides my shlong, and a ton of Rubik’s cubes. They called it “Rubik’s cube diapers ”.  There were more instructions, unfortunately i cannot remember them.  I was trying to read the instructions, and look for information online, but it was impossible. Almost any tap on the screen led to a poppup that wanted me to sign a contract with them, that would make me pay 9000 a month to their bank account. The room I was in, had two fake mirrors of large scale, large like a classroom board. One on the right, and one on the front of me. On the left, there was this little table, fairly short, so you could use it while seated on the floor. It was for kids. I was in this place made for kids, it was an escape room. The two fake mirrors on the right and front, I was actually on their visible side, the spectating side. On the other side of said mirrors, there were little kids, who were playing in these childish, colorful toylike constructions, sleds, little steps and tunnels, all the things you’d find in a park. I remember well that I could select the children like in photoshops select and mask feature,i could select anything behind the glass, and it would turn red with an overlay, as if I could just cut it out and there would be a transparent background behind, but no, that was all. I remember testing it out, it was quick, there was this little child I selected. I remember looking at my left, and there I saw the mother of my dear friend Jason, Vera, we started talking about things, I don’t remember much as this was early in the dream. I only remember that, I told her that I had spent 12 hours there, but I couldn’t finish my sentence to say, that I was trapped by these hackers. She interrupted me, and due to that, I know she didn’t get the whole truth, and thought I was weird for spending 12 consecutive hours in this children’s escape room. I don’t remember much from that. 



I was somewhere in between the cityscapes, it was raining a lot, it was dark. I was pointing my gun towards the head of the fellow on the right, while he was doing the same thing to the fellow on his right, and he was pointing his gun at me. I do not recognise these people from real life. We knew someone was a traitor. One of us was part of the hackers who demanded naked pictures with Rubick’s cube diapers from me + 20 dollars ransom. We had to find out who. I looked at Tom cruise on my right, we locked our eye contact and nodded, I pointed my gun at the fellow on the left and shot, no bullet came out, just an empty sound. We both were quick to react, realising I hadn’t shot him, we grabbed him, I got ahold of his right hand and his gun, while Tom Cruise held him. I now shot him, after a bit of fighting. We were still there, just had moved below a covered part of this rooftop where It didn’t rain, during the fighting. The traitor turned into a rat. He was now a rat, laying down there, shot, and dying; helpless. He asked for help. I squatted next to him, holding my gun, and I said; 



***“I’m sorry. I never wanted to kill no man, but it was necessary. if you want, you could be one of my rats. You would at least have some food and live with the other rats In my apartment- miserably, or, you can die here”*** 



He gasped -  what seemed like the last air that was inside his ratty lungs, me and Tom were slowly walking away from him while I was finishing my speech. I had no intention of having another rat in my apartment, but I did not want to leave him without hope, or maybe I was just being a prick, by offering food to a dying rat. As I looked back one last time, he turned into Shreck in real time, in front of my eyes, then he took out a semiautomatic, some type of fast, and fairly big machinegun, almost like he got it from his inventory as he drew it out with a one handed backside motion, saying: 

***""If you don’t want to get Shrecked, don’t get Shreck mad. ""***

I looked at Tom, who was fairly far away from me, he held his hands in the air and made an expression that made me realise I was on my own now. I started running as Shreck was chasing me and shooting at me, I ran towards a part of this rooftop I had briefly seen earlier and knew I could parkour to hide, or find an escape through, while Shreck was slowly walking behind me with the machine gun. It was still raining. I jumped and sled on  the wet ground so that I could quickly grab a bar and get to the lower level, looked like a garage, I was hoping to find an escape.

I met a pretty cool guy today on a hike on a volcanic crater. We spoke a lot about a little as you do on a hike. Views, plant life, work, school and animals. We got onto a really interesting conversation. 

What makes a good conversation ? 

Imagine you're sat with a person you'd love to have a conversation with. How would that conversation go should you be having a really good conversation. 

Some of the things that came up in our conversation: (based on the assumption we were sat having a cigar in an armchair and whisky). 

A mutual interest in each others interests (e.g. I liked coffee, he preferred tea but we both were interested in methods of making our preferred drink). 

Questions that generally show interest. (In contrast  to questions for questions sake). 

Enjoying debate and acceptance of another point of view.

 An acceptance of silent moments during the conversation for thinking or questioning.

I've been thinking about this all day since.

1hq6pyx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hq6pyx,Profit and loss for the year 2024,"F and O (FUTURE & OPTIONS), gets a popular vote, in terms of compounding money. I am just posting my trades to show that swing trading in cash markets, also yields good results. 

I have been investing and trading since 2018 and this has been my most profitable year with 50% return on capital ( excluding 2020 crash year, where everyone made money)

Yes, I do know the returns were helped by the bull run and some swing traders even made more than this. This is just the benchmark I set for myself and will try to beat this next year. 

There is no extraordinary trading strategy i use. I have watchlists of around 400 good stocks (mostly from mutual fund portfolios, mix of large, mid and small caps)


Everyday, after coming home from work or in early morning, I scroll through all the stocks and identify stocks at support level. 

Then I finalize 4 or 5 stocks for entry. 

Before I place GTT order, I Google the stock name, to look for any recent news. Sometimes stocks fall because of fraud/ FDA/ SEBI warning/ new competition/other news. I avoid these stocks and then place GTT order along with target for the remainder stocks [1-2 stocks]. 

When gtt order is triggered (profit). I use the profits, along with original capital, in a new stock( after due dligience as mentioned above). I repeat the cycle on and on.

I only mark up the loss, I am willing to take, not the profits. Profits vary from 1 to 6% on each trade.

Though, I have explained in a simple manner, the selection of the particular stocks, which will yield profits, took a lot of time, effort, repitition, chart monitoring and practice. I also do fundamental analysis of the intended stock and try to understand the particular stock business, too.

Yes I do know, F&O traders make more than this and even some etfs. But I make good money from my day Job and this is my additional source of income.

I do indulge in F&O, during bear market, based on volatility, but it still yielded less return on capital than my swings.

Wishing all the redditors, happy new year and wishing you a profitable 2025!!!

After running into each other, they caught up and started to spark again. Long story short, he was asking if it was a mistake to start dating her again. Seemed like the consensus was he should try.

I feel as though I resorted to staying inside or to myself more. I used to go out for food a lot with friends as a social thing, or even to get coffee, or drinks. But my family says it’s not safe. And I got food poisoning this summer. I rarely eat out these days so the rare time I did, it just sucked. Then a few months go by and I got drinks with a friend and I couldn’t pee after for about 2 hours? I end up going to the doc and they ruled out like a lot by doing my labs (urinalysis etc) so I know these seem like small things and I do make plans around other things like just going on a walk or something. 

But it’s cold since it’s winter, and I don’t really have my own space at home right now because I’m staying with family. I also noticed the last time we got drinks the bartender handled our money then he was using his hands to use his phone/ take limes and squeeze them in and then put them into the drinks, so his fingers dipped into the drink. I know these things are common when eating or drinking out but idk how much of me is having anxiety and how much of it is just me being too worried. Like I get scared I’ll get norovirus or food poisoning or something if I eat out, or that the alcohol at a bar was somehow bad. I’m trying to change my thinking but it’s embarrassing to admit this and it hinders my socializing. ",2,1735618981.0,selfimprovement,4,0.75,False

The siblings lounged on the empty red brick veranda in the early morning light; the two of them were still wiping sleep from their eyes as they huddled around a circular mesh-metal table. The clown drank coffee, mumbled about the bartender they’d met in Dallas and idly asked his sister if she believed they had any eggs to put in the drink. She fiddled with the tablet she’d scavenged from the disaster camp and simply shook her head at his inquiry. Hoichi sat there in a thin white bathrobe and a pair of complimentary sandals that were provided by the hotel. Trinity’s attire matched her brother’s. Their faces had the dulled, refreshed quality of people freshly bathed.

“Maybe there’s no charge,” said Hoichi; he slurped at the edge of his white mug. His gaze drifted to the vaguely pergola-esque overhang through which the morning sun scarcely came through. No others had joined them—the only other person they’d seen since waking had been their waiter. The other tables, three others in total, remained empty besides their unlit candle centerpieces. Hoichi coughed, took another sip of his coffee, “Maybe you need to charge it, I said.”

Trinity tossed the tablet onto the mesh table which offered an unpleasant screech as it slid across the surface. “Well, what good is it then?”

“It’s early,” said Hoichi.

Trinity nodded and craned back in her seat as much as her shoulders would allow; she rested her hands across her stomach, a stomach which she distended with mock exaggeration. “Someone will buy it anyway, I’m sure. They’ll melt it down or—I don’t know. It’s worth something.”

“How’s the scratch?” asked Hoichi.

“Enough for last night. Tonight too. But, I’d like to stay awhile.”

“Did you see those people in the street last night? The ones at the gate? The ones at the stalls—I think that’s what they were doing. Selling stuff.”

“I always heard Roswell had some eccentrics, but it’s like anywhere else,” Trinity cut her eyes at her brother, “Doesn’t matter. I told you I wanted to rest wherever we went. And here we are. I’m so fucking tired. How’s the foot?”

The clown lifted his right foot and exposed the torn bubble there upon his heel; it was a ruptured blister. The skin was irritated, angry, red. “The boot’s been rubbing me wrong for a while. I just need a new pair.”

Trinity stared at the unmoving tablet on the table. “Should’ve grabbed a new pair when you had the chance.”

Hoichi nodded, “Sure. Should’a, could’a, would’a. Maybe I’m tired too.” He put his foot back to the ground, planted both of his legs there and pillared his arms on either side of his cup, so that his cheeks rested on his palms. “I didn’t realize it until last night. With that bed—a bed all to myself. God, I woke up this morning sore. In a good way,” he nodded, “How about you?”

“I like our room. Our beds.” It was her turn for her eyes to drift to the overhang; a glance of sunlight struck across her face, and she blinked and shifted so her face was entirely within shade. “What’s the plan? We don’t talk enough about it.”

“We talk about it, don’t we?”

“I’m scared, Hoichi.”

His eyes met hers and they remained locked like that for seconds without either of them breaking the silence. “Me too,” said the clown.

“Let’s say we find somewhere where no one knows our past,” said the hunchback.

He nodded for her to continue while taking another mouthful from his cup.

“Let’s say we do. What then? Do we get jobs? What kind of jobs? Do we just make pretend and have a family?”

“Bold of you to offer,” said the clown. He chuckled.

“I didn’t mean together,” Trinity rolled her eyes.

“I know,” said Hoichi, “I love you, alas my heart belongs elsewhere.”

“I’d like that though,” said Trinity, “I’d like that more than anything. I want to pretend, even if it hurts me in the long run. I want a family. I want someone to fall in love with me and I want to fall in love with them too.”

“Children?” asked the clown.

“Maybe,” shrugged Trinity, “It wouldn’t matter as long as someone loved me. I want to feel normal. I know normal is relative, but you know what I mean, don’t you?”

He nodded and frowned.

“More than anything, I want a moment of peace. Tuscaloosa wasn’t that and that’s where all the freedom seekers went. Dallas. Memphis. Kansas City. I want a place to be, and every place we go, I ask myself if it’s the one. It seems like wherever we go, there’s someone out to get us. I’ve got this idea of what life’s supposed to be like. I’d work in the gardens, and I’d hang out among animals and smell flowers and grow food straight out of the ground—I’d cook too—I’m not too good at it, I know, but I’d do it. I’d never be so rich that anyone wanted anything from me, but I’d never be so poor as to worry. I don’t want much. I want a life, is that so much to ask for?”

“Of course not.”

She planted her face in her hands and continued to go through a muffle, “Just a life. One good one. Like I said, I’ve got this idea of it. I’d come home to a place not too large and not too small. I’d never need to sleep on the ground again because I’d have a bed. One I own. Maybe,” she pointed at her brother, “Maybe like you said, I’d have kids waiting for me there. But that wouldn’t matter. I’d love them, kids, of course. But I just want a place. A life. Somewhere to be. Even without kids, there’d be someone there waiting on me. Or maybe they came from wherever they were during the day, and we’d cook together, and then I wouldn’t need to worry about being a subpar cook, because they’d be there and maybe they’d know how. It’s silly, I know.”

Trinity lifted her head from her hands, revealing the diamonds in her eyes. She shook her head as though to remove the jewels there.

Hoichi smiled stiffly and moved his hand across the table, but by the time she was within reach of him, her eyes had gone dry, and she smiled back at him.

The waiter abruptly arrived upon the scene and asked if they were ready for food.

Hoichi asked for a refill on his coffee and asked if they ever put eggs in it. The waiter politely declined.

Trinity ordered water.

For the rest of the morning, the pair gorged themselves on stale toast, pressed sausage, potatoes.

They remained in silence until they returned to their room.

 

\*\*\*

 

“It’s a festival,” called the young woman, “Once a year, the aliens come, and one of these years, they’re going to take us with them.”

“You think so?” Hoichi raised his brow and crossed his arms; his sister stood alongside him there on the jack-rabble sidewalk. After settling their tab with the hotel, the siblings departed to find cheaper lodgings and had become sidetracked by a mass of spectators gathered on the corner of Main and Frazier. The spectators—many of whom wore makeshift antennae or oversized black goggles—had all painted themselves green; the stuff was pungent in the dry heat and much of the green ran from their skin with sweat; this did not seem to dissuade anyone’s enthusiasm. The siblings, further surrounded by the group as some went to dance in the street, covered the lower halves of their faces. The signs, either plastered against street posts, or held over the heads of the fervent crowd, read a variety of messages. TAKE US HOME. SAVE US. WE’RE READY! Many of the bystanders carried handheld speaker radios, all tuned to the same station. From all speakers, ‘Acid Raindrops’ blared.

An ancient vehicle was pushed backwards down Frazier, then those gathered halted the wheels of the strange thing with misshapen stones so it would shift no longer, and a boyish man examined the nozzle on the rear of the vehicle; it was a great hollowed thing with a massive, cradled tanker. The boyish man began passing out drinks to the others as they queued.

The young woman, which was kind enough to offer them directions, guffawed at Hoichi’s inquiry, “Of course! I’m surprised you didn’t know already. Isn’t that why you put your face together like that?” She pointed at him so closely that she might’ve fingered his nostril.

The clown winced from the woman’s hand and swatted the air between them while taking a step from the sidewalk into the street. He pivoted as though to further confront the young woman, but she was already gone among her people, snaking around the vehicle.

“Hey!” he called after, “What’s aliens?”

No one paid him mind, save his sister. She shrugged. “Little green men, aren’t they?”

“Are they some kind of demon? Mutant? Are they human?”

“Don’t ask me,” said Trinity; her gaze remained on the strange vehicle and the man dispersing drinks to the crowd, “I’ll be right back.”

She too disappeared into the crowd and Hoichi was left alone.

He straightened his robe, tugged on the waist of his jeans, and returned to the sidewalk and leaned against the nearest unsullied post.

The electric speakers continued their music; another track, and another, and another, and then a voice, smooth and masculine, came clearly through them all.

“This is your pal, Psycho-Jam, with another hour of variety music, every hour, on the hour. Don’t forget to tune in every day for Apache radio, the greatest station in all these continental, once united states.” There was a brief pause on the radios and a minor bit of static, before the man’s voice returned, “It’s ten-thirty-eight this fine morning, on July seventh of our Lord’s year twenty-two-sixteen.” Another pause.

The crowd gathered there on the corner of Main became further enthralled with their libations as a woman on stilts towered over the ever-thickening throng. She wore a pair of improvised disco balls on her hands, and they reflected light in harsh glances across Hoichi’s face. He turned, crossed his arms, averted his eyes to the ground entirely.

The man on the radio spoke again, “I feel like I can hear those nuts in Roswell celebrating from here—""

Whatever followed was immediately drowned out by the conjoined yelps and cries of pleasure at their mention from the citizens of Roswell.

“Of course,” said the voice, as the festival goers cooed to a minimum, “You know I’m joking. I love you crazy bastards! Keep it tuned and keep those Republic borders on the furthest horizon, alien lovers, because I’ve a special track. This one goes out to all of you, beamed directly from my soul to yours.”

A pause followed before the music.

‘Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft’ played hesitantly from the speakers and another round of cheers erupted from the festival goers.

The makeshift vehicle, which was well surrounded, rocked on its axles as the crowd grew impatient, fervent; the boyish man that dispensed the drink called for the people to calm and they did, if only a bit.

Hoichi watched them, then cast his gaze to the sky that’d gone pink; he moved his mouth like he intended to speak something, but he never produced anything—the clown hunkered there by the post, stared into the gutter, watched the cars and battery wagons which angled down Main; many of those occupied vehicles kept their speed to a cruise and no one honked.

The festival was in full swing.

A finger tapped Hoichi’s shoulder, and he rose to stand and greet the return of Trinity—she carried with her two cups and passed one to her brother. They drank the strange greenish liquid and Trinity grinned while Hoichi sipped and neither of them understood they were consuming ayahuasca laced brew. The hallucinogenic properties took time.

Trinity smacked her lips and leaned into the shoulder of her brother and whispered, “You heard it on the radio, didn’t you? The border’s behind us, huh? Maybe we’ve come somewhere they won’t touch. Maybe we’re good.”

Hoichi drank heartily and commented that he was fairly thirsty in the heat.

 

\*\*\*

 

Trinity awoke suddenly, covered in sweat, totally unclothed in a strange bed; she lay on her side, staring at a brown wall and a marred vanity table. A finger traced her spine delicately; the finger and the person which it belonged to was behind her, unseen. There were no blankets, and she remained like that for minutes, glaze-eyed, before she launched from the bed and fell onto the floor. She spun around, scrambling, leering; she seemed like a strange marionette on her own feet and planted her hands onto the vanity table for support. She recognized none of her surroundings, nor the person which remained prone in the bed.

The person there, a stranger woman, laid exposed herself; she grinned at Trinity, rose on the pillow tucked beneath her head and supported herself with an elbow. The woman’s hair was flax-colored, stiff but long and thick. A mild green hue remained on the woman’s skin; she’d been unable to wash the paint away entirely. “It’s the middle of the day, you know,” was all the woman said.

Trinity’s breaths came in wild bouts, and she twisted around to look at her own face in the vanity’s mirror—her eyes were red, veiny. She smacked her lips together, swallowed, twisted her fists in her eyes. She shook her head and pivoted round again to examine the woman on the bed, “I’m thirsty,” she gurgled; her voice erupted from her throat deeply and she coughed. The hunchback shook her head again and her eyes shot around the room.

It was a bedroom—it was lived-in; across the vanity there was makeup, brushes, and cheaply made trinkets. The overhead bulb, recessed in the ceiling, was off. All light that lit the room came in through a window beyond the woman on the bed, hanging there in the wall, draped with thin curtains. Beneath Trinity’s feet was carpet, a large area rug rolled across stone flooring. The walls, smooth and plainly gray, were amateurly decorated with scrawling sets of desert flowers, seemingly done with black ink. Along the wall nearest the foot of the bed was a door that led on to some unknown place. By the door stood a chest of drawers.

Trinity was erect there by the vanity table, shivering and rubbing her arms. “Water please,” she asked the strange woman in the bed.

The woman’s smile broadened further, and she rose from the bed and found the blanket which belonged to the bed—it was a thin, sheet-like thing, balled on the floor on the opposite side of the room; she pulled the blanket over her shoulders and wrapped it around her body, togalike. “You’re probably wondering if we had sex, aren’t you?” The woman tilted her head while her eyes traced Trinity’s nudity. “We did not,” she said firmly, “You were burning up, vomiting. You had too much, I believe.”

Trinity shook her head and swallowed again. She covered her crotch and chest with her hands. “Just water please.”

The woman crossed the room, moved to the door and snatched a ribbon from the chest of drawers. This, she used to tie her hair back. She laughed at the hunchback and disappeared from the room, leaving the door half-open.

“Where’s my brother?” asked Trinity.

“Huh?” called the woman from the place she’d entered.

“The clown! Where’s the clown?”

 

\*\*\*

 

The Nephilim lumbered across the dirt plain with the sun high in the sky. He snorted and dragged his forearm across his nose and snorted again. Over his body, he wore the paint-horse cloak and nothing else.

Behind him, he dragged a still body by a naked ankle, leaving in his wake a broad trail leading in the direction from which he’d come.

The Nephilim stopped for a moment, stood stiffly upright, dropping the foot from his hand; the massive humanoid creature lifted his fists far over his head, stretching his muscles. His joints resounded several pops then he relaxed and angled around to the body he’d taken so far. The thing remained unmoving besides steady breathing.

Hoichi was the body, not quite asleep, not quite coherent; his eyelids fluttered in response to the looming shadow of The Nephilim.

The creature hunkered down nearer the man’s face and delicately brushed the captive’s cheek with the back of his hand. *Hübscher Clown,* said the creature.

## The Rise of the Smart Coffee Maker: Brewing Convenience and Control

The modern coffee lover demands convenience and control, and smart coffee makers with Wi-Fi are delivering just that.  No longer are we bound to the kitchen timer or the unpredictable whims of a traditional drip machine.  With a smart coffee maker, your morning brew is now at your fingertips, literally. This detailed guide explores the best smart coffee makers with Wi-Fi connectivity, helping you choose the perfect model to integrate seamlessly into your smart home and daily routine.  We'll cover key features, compare top models, and address any potential concerns you might have.

### Key Features That Define a Smart Coffee Maker

Smart coffee makers offer a range of features designed to elevate your coffee experience beyond the ordinary.  These features go far beyond simply brewing a pot; they provide unparalleled customization and convenience.

#### **1. Remote Control and Scheduling: Your Coffee, Your Schedule**

Imagine waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, perfectly timed to your alarm.  This isn't a fantasy; it's the reality offered by many **app-controlled coffee makers**.  Most models allow you to schedule brewing times via a dedicated mobile app, ensuring your coffee is ready precisely when you want it.  This eliminates the need for setting timers or rushing to the kitchen before your morning commute.  Apps like the Smarter Coffee app and the Atomi Smart app provide intuitive interfaces for scheduling, managing brewing settings, and even receiving notifications when your coffee is ready.  Features like """"Wake Up Mode"""" and """"Home Mode,"""" as found in the Smarter Coffee Maker, offer pre-programmed settings for optimal convenience.  The Atomi Smart WiFi Coffee Maker, similarly, allows for easy daily schedule adjustments.

#### **2. Voice Integration: Hands-Free Brewing Perfection**

The integration of voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant further enhances the convenience of smart coffee makers.  Simply use voice commands to start brewing, adjust settings, or check the status of your machine.  The Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker, for instance, boasts seamless Alexa integration, simplifying the brewing process significantly.  This hands-free control is particularly useful in busy mornings or when your hands are full.  The ability to say """"Alexa, turn on the coffee machine"""" is a testament to the seamless integration of smart technology into our daily lives.

#### **3. Customization Options: Your Coffee, Your Way**

Smart coffee makers are not one-size-fits-all devices; they offer extensive customization options to cater to individual preferences.  Adjust the brew strength, temperature, and even the brewing mode to perfectly match your desired taste profile. The Café Specialty Drip Coffee Maker, for example, provides four unique brewing modes and customizable strength and temperature settings, allowing you to experiment and find your perfect cup. The Atomi Smart WiFi Coffee Maker offers a simple choice between regular and strong modes, ensuring a straightforward customization process.

#### **4. Smart Home Integration: A Connected Coffee Experience**

Many smart coffee makers integrate with other smart home systems, expanding their functionality and creating a unified smart home ecosystem.  Using platforms like IFTTT (If This Then That), you can connect your coffee maker to other devices and create automated routines.  For example, you could set up a routine where your smart lights turn on when your coffee maker starts brewing.  The Smarter Coffee Maker excels in this area, connecting to devices like Google Nest Home and Siri-enabled devices. The Atomi Smart WiFi Coffee Maker also leverages Alexa and Google Assistant integration, bolstering its compatibility within existing smart home setups.

It's important to use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication wherever possible to protect your device and network.  Always keep your coffee maker's firmware updated to patch any security vulnerabilities.

1hq6kz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/phtravel/comments/1hq6kz3/mainland_china_trip_harbin_beijing/,Mainland China Trip (Harbin + Beijing)," Just came back from my 8-day Harbin + Beijing trip and boy I had the best trip of my life so far. For East Asia, I've been to Japan, SK, Taiwan, HK/Macau but Mainland China hits really different. My preparation for this China trip was the most challenging but it was sooo worth it.

1.) The People. The Mainland Chinese are the nicest and most welcoming of them all especially in Harbin. Among the East Asian countries I've been to, language barrier in Mainland China is the most palpable but since they really want help us tourists, most of them are ready with their translator apps in order to communicate with tourists. I saw the biggest smiles, was greeted ""Sawadee ka!"", and was asked what country I'm from a couple of times by the locals. Hospitality was not just genuine, as it was also very personal. Also, totoo ang balita na maraming pogi sa Northern China. Talbog ang mga guys sa Seoul. Hahaha 

2.) The Food. Unlike the other East Asian countries, there's not much information available on Facebook and Google reviews on the recommendations for restaurants especially in Harbin. So, the decision of where to eat was just based on what's near at the time when I started to get hungry. Haha All but one (with the  Michelin distinction pa) were feasts to my taste buds. As a Mandapop fan, I happened to visit Taiwan twice this year. I love Taiwan but IMO, their food is kinda bland kaya I really don't get the hype. In contrast, food in Mainland China at least in the cities I've been to was really flavorful. Also, coffee in China is better than in Korea. I feel like the cafes in Seoul are more for the ✨aesthetic✨ than the coffee itself. Admittedly, food in China is ranked low in the aesthetic department (unlike Japan's) pero bawing bawi naman sa lasa! Ang sarap din pati fastfood nila. My favorite is the Mcdo fried chicken. Ang laki ng manok at ang quality ng meat! Very crispy outside and tender naman the meat inside. Flavorful but not salty unlike sa PH.

3.) The Shopping. Even before going to China, I've come to appreciate the designs of brands from China. HLA is my new favorite clothing brand. I find BYD and GAC cars really pogi. So, it came as no surprise when I found shopping in China very satisfying. Alongside international brands are Chinese clothing brands which, IMO, have better designs. Really wanted to buy a lot but I am gravely limited by the storage space in my small condo. 

4.) The Transportation. Clean, efficient, and reliable. Rode to HSR from Harbin to Beijing and the overnight sleeper train from Harbin to Beijing. No need for physical tickets. You just need to show your passport to enter the gates for the long distance train. China is that technologically advanced! A lot of people rave about Japan's Shinkansen but China's HSR deserves the commendation too as some of the trains are even faster than Shinkansen. China's long distrance train system is very extensive. What I also love about China's transportation system is that it gives you with a lot of choices that will cater to your needs. Without breaking your bank, you can ride a Didi (a ride-hailing app) if you feel tired from walking or if you are bringing a lot. My ~30km Didi ride from the hotel to the airport just cost 650 pesos! In a modern, clean, pleasant-smelling, and beautifully-designed Chinese car at that. If it was in Manila, I think the Grab ride would've cost me over a thousand pesos. My only complaint is that there seemed to be a lot of people smoking just anywhere. 

I think China used to be a popular destination among Filipinos years ago. It is not the case recently as PAL has even suspended flights to Beijing. Ayun, I was really inspired by Redditors who shared their China experience in this subreddit. Thank you for the tips and insights as they helped me achieve this memorable China trip without any significat setbacks and problems. So for those who are planning their international trip, I highly recommend China.",10,1735618778.0,phtravel,10,0.82,False

You may think that this question is absurd or obvious but I can assure you that after an exhaustive search there is not enough data to answer it, not even in Hario support manuals, videos or official publications.

I attached the images of the two possible options for a better understanding (textured and flat sides).

I will really appreciate your help on this.

The recent changes to AP cost dropped the previously useless Gatling laser's AP cost substantially -- fully modded, it's an itty bitty 4. A rapid mod for the second star bumps is up to a 60 fire rate, which is enough for Conductor's and Bullet Shield to consistently proc.

The armor set with its full 2* Luck, 2 pieces of limit-breaking, and 3 pieces of rejuvenator ensure a critical every other shot.

Oh, the damage is lower than a Gatling plasma? Yeah, well I don't have to drink coffee to stay in VATS. I have a calibrated capacitor that I don't have to grind to find, either. I can literally clock over 250 uninterrupted shots in VATS with this build as long as you are in a group (even solo). Did I mention I can critical every other shot?
