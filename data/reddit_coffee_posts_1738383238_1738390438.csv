And I refuse to be complicit in fueling anything that supports this administration. I read recently how important resistance is during this time, there are so many ways to show resistance. Joy in a time of deep fear and sadness is resistance. If you identify as queer, continuing to be out and proud in a time of homophobic and transphobia is resistance. Hope in a time of hopelessness is resistance. So that is what I, to the best of my ability, will do every day. 

If that’s all you can do, then amazing. For those who have more energy to give towards resistance, here are some other ways:

1. Money talks. How did the people in power get to power? Money. When money is taken away from them, what do they have left? Companies we use/shop at that we can boycott and where we can shop at instead: 
- Amazon (this includes Whole Foods and Audible as well): unfortunately it’s hard to find alternatives. Costco, Etsy, Uncommon Goods, EBay, Poshmark, and IKEA are some good alternatives. 
- Meta (Instagram, Facebook, What’sApp, Threads): BlueSky [which just hit 30 million users] is similar to Twitter, and I hear maybe they’re working on developing an app that will rival Instagram soon? If you use Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp is also a great place to buy and sell. 
- Uber: Lyft 
- OpenAI: Unsure of any alternatives to this one, but the environmental impact of AI usage isn’t great, so I try and steer away anyways. 
- Home Depot: Lowe’s 

Even better? Shop locally. Use OfferUp, Poshmark, local thrift stores, go to farmers markets or local butchers, go to local bookstores and get your coffee from local cafes. GET A LIBRARY CARD. Did you know your local library has more than just books? Hoopla partners with local libraries for you to watch free (or low cost) movies?? They also have audiobooks and ebooks for you to check out! 


2. Call your reps. Demand they take a stand against Trump. Keep the pressure on them. Remember, the people elected them, and their job is to represent all of their people. 

3. If you want to go even further, protest and get organized. Check out r/50501.

Remember, our generation is insanely resilient. We have seen and been through so much in our time on this earth. We deserve to fight for a future that we want to see, and we also deserve to take care of ourselves. So, remember to do things you love, be with the people you love and who love you, eat, drink water, and breathe.

1iezxo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausjdocs/comments/1iezxo3/the_np_squid_game/,The NP Squid Game,"SPOILER ALERT FOR SQUID GAME.

This was a thought experiment inspired by a comment made by u/blueboat3939. 

This may not be for you if you don’t want to read a wall of text.

**The NP Squid Game**

We’re a few years into the future. Private equity has taken over healthcare, funding mega-clinics where nurse practitioners dominate medical care. In hospitals, in outpatient clinics and in emergency rooms NPs are now the new doctors.  

Medical practitioners are pushed to the margins as expensive relics of an outdated system. The public, lured in by cheap, accessible healthcare, has little understanding of the compromises being made.

But behind the scenes, a growing group of medical practitioners, frustrated with the way the system operates, begin to fight back. They see how regulatory bodies like AHPRA and the Medical Board of Australia have abandoned medical practitioners in favor of corporate interests and cost-cutting measures.

And so, a new game begins.

A decentralised movement emerges, one that doesn’t protest or petition, but instead uses the system against itself. They decide to crowdfund legal fees for aggressive medical malpractice firms, weaponising litigation to expose unsafe practices, force regulatory action, and ultimately turn the financial model of NP-led healthcare against itself.

At first, the lawsuits are small. A few high-profile cases where patients suffered severe harm at the hands of unsupervised NPs. A missed cancer diagnosis, a botched cosmetic procedure, a fatal prescribing error - cases that would normally be settled quietly are now turned into public spectacles.

But as the movement grows, so does the ambition.

A self-sustaining legal war chest begins to form. Each payout from a malpractice lawsuit is reinvested into funding more cases, creating a ‘snowball’ effect. Private malpractice firms see an opportunity, and suddenly, suing NP-run clinics becomes a profitable venture.

It doesn’t take long before insurance premiums skyrocket for NP-led practices. Mega-clinics, once the darlings of private equity, start bleeding cash as insurers refuse to cover them without stricter oversight and medical practitioner involvement.

The movement starts. Once dismissed as a fringe effort, it has now turned into a force that regulatory bodies like AHPRA can no longer ignore.

At the center of it all, the players in this game are forced to adapt. Nurse practitioners, once convinced they were leading the future of healthcare at a lower cost, now find themselves the hunted in a rising wave of litigation. 

AHPRA, the architects of this new dystopian system, struggle to justify their policies as the financial burden of malpractice cases piles up. Meanwhile, the investors behind the lawsuits - frustrated medical practitioners, malpractice firms, and a growing number of private backers who see the financial potential in challenging NP dominance through litigation - continue to push forward, knowing that the longer the game continues, the more the balance shifts in their favor.

At first, regulators resist. They double down, defending the system, insisting that NP-led care is just as safe as medical practitioner-led care. But the lawsuits continue. The settlements grow larger and larger. The war chest piles up. The public begins to take notice.

Slowly, the balance shifts. Private equity firms start pulling out, unwilling to bankroll a system hemorrhaging money from legal losses. Insurance companies demand medical practitioner oversight before offering coverage. Regulators, now under immense pressure, are forced to rewrite policy.

And just like that, the tide begins to turn.

Was this the right way to do it? Some will call it cynical, ruthless, even unethical, a cold-blooded legal war designed to crush the opposition. 

Others will argue that it was the only way to restore accountability in a system where money and politics had eroded patient safety.

**A short story based on this:**

The courtroom was silent except for the soft clicking of a stenographer’s keyboard. The claimant’s barrister, a sharp-eyed man in his forties, leaned over the polished wooden table, flipping through a stack of glossy medical records. The air was thick with tension as the judge glanced down at the latest exhibit—an MRI scan that should have been ordered months ago but never was.

At the defendant’s table, a nurse practitioner sat stiffly, eyes darting between the judge and her solicitor. Her face was pale, her hands clenched into tight fists in her lap. The patient, a 52-year-old woman, had come in with persistent back pain. The NP had reassured her it was just a muscular issue, prescribed some ibuprofen, and sent her home. Months later, when the pain worsened, a specialist finally ordered imaging. The diagnosis: metastatic spinal cancer. Too late for surgery. Too late for anything.

The claimant’s barrister turned toward the jury, his voice heavy with controlled anger.

“This was not just a mistake. This was not an unfortunate oversight. This was deliberate negligence—the result of a system that allowed someone without the proper training to make life-or-death decisions.”

The NP’s solicitor objected, but the damage was done. The jury members, a mix of middle-aged professionals and retirees, exchanged glances. They weren’t just thinking about this case anymore. They were thinking about the last time they went to a bulk-billed clinic. About the nurse who gave them advice instead of a doctor.

Above them, far away from the courtroom, others were watching…

A darkened room high above Sydney’s CBD overlooked the skyline, but no one inside was paying attention to the view. The true spectacle was on the enormous screen at the front of the room, broadcasting a live feed of the courtroom below.

A row of figures sat in oversized leather chairs, their faces obscured by masks shaped like animals. A fox. A lion. An owl. A vulture. Each was an investor in the game—stakeholders in a system that was slowly being dismantled, trial by trial.

On the screen, the courtroom proceedings unfolded with the slow, methodical destruction of the NP’s defence. The barrister’s voice was crisp, deliberate, every sentence tightening the noose. One of the jurors shifted uncomfortably. They knew which way the verdict would go.

The man in the lion mask swirled the whisky in his glass, watching the NP’s increasingly panicked expression. “That’s the third case this month,” he mused, turning to the man beside him, whose vulture mask glinted in the low light. “How much did we put into this one?”

“A hundred grand for legal fees,” the vulture responded. “But the payout will be well over two million. We’ll reinvest half, pull the rest.”

The woman in the owl mask leaned forward, eyes sharp even through the carved golden beak. “And the insurers?”

“They’re getting nervous. We’ve already seen premium hikes for NP-led clinics in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland. Soon, it’ll be too costly for them to operate without medical practitioner oversight.”

On the screen, the NP was trying to explain herself, stumbling over legal jargon. The judge remained impassive.

The fox mask shifted slightly as its owner adjusted his cufflinks. “The best part? They still think this is about patient safety.”

More laughter. Ice clinked against glass. The game was working.

The scene cuts to the waiting room of MedWay Health, once a bustling NP-led bulk-billing clinic, now felt like a ghost town. The overhead lights flickered slightly, and a receptionist scrolled mindlessly through her phone, barely glancing up at the handful of patients scattered across the cheap plastic chairs. A week ago, the place had been overflowing. But something had changed.

A manager in a crisp blazer stormed through the back hallway, pushing open the door to the break room where two nurse practitioners sat nursing their coffees.

“We just lost our indemnity cover.”

The words landed like a slap. One of the NPs blinked. “What? That’s impossible. We’ve never had an issue—”

“It doesn’t matter,” the manager snapped. “The insurers won’t cover us unless we bring in doctors to oversee every case. And even if we did, our premiums are so high now that we’d be operating at a loss.”

One of the NPs, a woman who had been in practice for years, shook her head. “So… what does this mean for us?”

“It means we shut down.”

The room fell into stunned silence.

“Regulators aren’t going to save us,” the manager continued. “Private equity has already pulled out. We were profitable when lawsuits were rare, but now? Now we’re a liability.”

A loud bang echoed from the front of the clinic—a patient, frustrated with the long wait, slamming the door on his way out. The NP who had spoken let out a slow breath.

“So this is how it ends?”

The manager ran a hand through his hair. “This is how it ends.”

The screen in the VIP viewing room flickered to a new image—MedWay Health, now shut down, its glass doors locked, a ‘For Lease’ sign taped to the front. The vulture mask turned slightly, admiring the sight.

“That one fell faster than I expected,” he murmured.

The lion mask chuckled. “They always do once the money dries up.”

The owl mask tapped a manicured nail against the leather armrest. “We move to the next one. Keep the pressure up.”

On the screen, the image shifted again—to the next clinic on the list.

The game continued.

Ran out of things to do at work, brought my project and made headway on the lace I'm making. Spent 2 hours playing minecraft on my phone. 

At Thanksgiving there was a huge scandal that dropped out of some of the youtubers I watched, and it all came back up again this week. It took a serious amount of willpower to not send a message about it. I text my brother in law instead, he's not as into it as me, but he is aware. It was a good conversation. I'm glad I didn't open that door. It was a healthy choice. I'm finding a lot of peace as the time passes. Which is what I need.

I find myself again being reminded about the support and team I have in my husband. Even feeling like death warmed over, this morning he helped me get a grumpy toddler out the door, made me coffee and made sure my car was remote started on time. Things he wouldn't have done 6 months ago. Things I'm grateful for. Even tonight, I had 2 things I wanted to do: finish something in my game and work on my project, he made sure I had time to do both those and checked in to see if I was happy with what I was getting done.

I'm hoping it snows enough for our daughter to get outside. She would love to build a snowman. I'm just hoping it's light enough I can still go expire yarn stores tomorrow.

&nbsp;

“Happy birthday Aunt May!” Gwen exclaimed as the door swung open. Her arms were loaded up with gift bags, as well as a large blue plastic cake box which laid over both of her outstretched forearms. “I would give you a hug but, uh, that might have to wait,” Gwen joked.

May chuckled and gestured frantically for Gwen to come inside. The young girl waddled in and, upon reaching the kitchen counter, gently placed the cake box atop it, followed by the various gift bags. Her arms were bright red with various ligature marks, but she didn’t care; the hug from May that followed shortly after made it all worth it.

It was May’s first birthday without Peter and, despite no prior coordination, both Gwen and Mary Jane had been determined to make it special. Despite his best efforts, Ben couldn’t make it and asked Gwen to pass on his (or rather, Peter’s) best wishes. In his absence, he had left her a gift and, thanks to putting in a good word with a coworker at the Daily Grind, had helped secure a discount on a birthday cake. Gwen took a deep breath before entering the living room with May.

As Gwen had half-expected, Mary Jane Watson was waiting for them, a mug of hot coffee in her hands. Her shirt was rolled up past her elbows, and her forearm muscles popped as she raised the mug to her mouth and sipped. Gwen couldn’t count the number of weeks it had been since she found out about Mary’s sudden musculature change, and yet the sight still surprised her.

“So, any highlights so far?” Gwen asked, shooting Mary a smile as she entered the room and sat.

May cleared her throat and thought for a moment. “Well, other than my wonderful present from Mary here, I’d have to say the text I got from Peter.”

Gwen blinked. “Oh, from Peter? What did it say?”

May dug in her pocket and retrieved her phone. After a few moments of tapping and swiping, May said, “Here it is. ‘Happy Birthday Aunt May. Even though I’m not with you today, I always think about you.’” Her eyes shimmered as tears began to form in her eyes. She blinked them back, shooting Gwen an apologetic smile. “It’s just… very sweet of him.”

Gwen was touched by the message, but something seemed… wrong. She leaned in slightly, hoping to catch a glimpse of the message or the phone number, but instead opted for a more direct approach - “Can I see it?”

May nodded, passing the phone. “I mean, it came from an unknown number, but it has to be Peter. I just know it is.” She nodded to herself again before adding, “Such a thoughtful boy.”

Gwen frowned slightly. It was true that the number was unsaved on Aunt May’s phone, and she had never received a message from the number prior to that day. As Mary launched into a tangent about her week - whether as a cover for Gwen or as a fortunate coincidence, Gwen wasn’t sure - she forwarded the message, as well as the number it had come from, to herself, before deleting any evidence of this on May’s phone.

Once there was a gap in the conversation, Gwen passed the phone back to May with a polite smile. “How about some cake?”

“You think it’s actually from Peter?” Felicia asked, her curiosity piqued. Her arms were folded firmly across her chest.

“It’s got a good chance,” Gwen nodded, pacing back and forth with a mixture of anxiety and excitement. “I was able to check where the message was sent from. Turns out it was from this downtown area of Boston. At first I thought, ‘there’s no way he can be in Boston,’ but then—” Gwen gestured for Mary to continue.

“I remembered that CCTV footage that you left on the computer for us to find, and I pulled up the location for the gas station Peter was using.” Felicia swallowed hard, but Mary was too engrossed in her notes to spot it. “It’s a block away from the I-95, the last gas station before you hit Connecticut. And the I-95 takes you to—”

“Boston,” Felicia realised, her brow furrowed in surprise. “He’s in Boston.”

“He might be in Boston,” Mary corrected, wincing. “But point being, this text is a good sign.”

“We have a lead,” Gwen chirped, struggling to hide her excitement.

Without missing a beat, Felicia rose to her feet with a smirk. “Guess we’re going to Boston then.”

&nbsp;
🔴⚪️🕷⚪️🔴
&nbsp;

The drive from New York City to Boston was just over 4 hours after accounting for snack stops and bathroom breaks, and by the time the trio passed the ‘Welcome to Boston’ sign, the sun was just starting to wane in the sky. In times of boredom, the three women had taken it in turns to choose a song to play, and very swiftly it became apparent that there were very differing tastes in music. Songs chosen by Gwen mainly consisted of heavy bass and drums, often with a high tenor shrieking heartfelt lyrics atop the instrumental; Mary had opted for a calmer tone, with acoustic guitars and soothing harmonies being a key feature; and Felicia spanned a number of genres from R&B to pop to light jazz.

And so as a heavy rock song blasted through the speaker of Mary’s car just as the car slowed to a stop at their final parking spot, Gwen considered it a personal win.

“Did we manage to get a precise read on where the message came from?” asked Mary, turning the key and opening her door. She peered at Gwen in her rearview mirror.

“Mhm,” Gwen replied. “It’s still a pretty big area, honestly, but it narrows it down a little better than ‘all of Boston’.”

As Gwen relayed the street name to Mary, Felicia took in the surroundings. She was surrounded by reddish-brown brickwork and cobbled streets; already, it was apparent that Boston was a much more technicolour city than New York. The dimming sunlight danced on the dampened pavement, still shiny from a light afternoon rain. And as the trio began surveying the everyday civilians for a familiar face, they soon realised just how small the crowds were.

“We should be in the right location,” Gwen confirmed, looking down at her phone. “Though, of course, there’s a pretty major issue here.”

Felicia quirked an eyebrow. “Which is?”

Gwen winced. “He might not be here.” There was a pause, then Gwen added, “We’ve only worked out where he sent the message, not where he is.”

Felicia opened her mouth to respond, but instead she saw Mary’s face change in her peripheral vision. Her eyes were wide, her mouth agape, but after a moment she swallowed and relaxed her face, being cautious not to cause a scene. “I… I think I see him. At the coffee shop, two o’clock.”

Gwen looked to her two o’clock. A man was sat at an outdoor table, hunched over a mug of dark liquid, with a dark grey hoodie pulled over his head. As he adjusted his posture to sip his drink, Gwen’s breath caught in her throat. His face was unmistakable - it was Peter’s face, that much was certain - but as Gwen continued to stare, silently hoping he did not see her, a sadness filled her. His face was sullen and the bags under his eyes were prominent even from a distance. It was hard to make out precise details, but he seemed to have a number of small scars dotted across his face, most noticeably a long white line running perpendicular to his jaw, stretching down onto his neck.

Mary was already in motion towards him, Felicia close behind, by the time Gwen snapped out of it. She caught up to them, her heart thumping, and Mary slowed to stop just a few feet away from him. She buried her hands in her pockets and gently cleared her throat.

She opened her mouth, forming the letter ‘P’ with her lips and preparing to address him by name, when she stopped. A confused, almost pained, expression melted onto her face, and as she looked at the man, she spoke with far less certainty than she had approached him with - “Peter?”

The man did not look up from his drink - from here, Mary could smell that it was coffee - and simply shook his head.

“That… can’t be you. Is it?”

“I don’t know anyone named Peter,” the man spoke. His voice sent a chill down each of the women’s spines; there was something uncanny about it - both familiar and not. “Think you’ve got the wrong guy.”

Gwen took a risk, retrieving the message from her phone. “Did you… have anything to do with this message?” She turned the screen to face the mysterious man, who squinted slightly against the bright LED screen. His eyes darted to Mary, and a flash of recognition came over his face. He blinked once, twice, before sucking in a deep breath.

“Okay, look,” he began, his voice suddenly low and intense. “I’m not who you think I am. So if you could just—”

“So it was you?” Felicia interrupted. “The message - it was you?”

The man’s upper lip curled into a snarl and he huffed. “Yeah. That was me.”

Mary scanned her surroundings; this gentleman was the only patron dining outdoors, and therefore there were no nosy bystanders. “And you’re… not Peter Parker, are you?”

The hooded man smiled, but there was no joy behind it. “No.”

Beat.

“My name is Kaine,” Kaine began, blinking slowly. “I’m… Fuck, am I really gonna say this?”

The trio didn’t dare speak. Instead, they waited patiently for Kaine to introduce himself.

“I’m… a clone of your friend.”

The silence that followed was deafening. Gwen slowly lowered herself into a chair; Felicia folded her arms tight, almost hugging herself; and Mary leaned in against the table. All had similar confused, bewildered, horrified looks on their faces.

“Another clone?” Mary muttered.

“Another?” Kaine remarked, his brow furrowed. “Look, I don’t know what you know about this guy, but—”

“We know enough,” Mary reassured. For emphasis, she leaned further towards Kaine, reading his face for expressions or emotions, and nodded softly. “We know enough.”

The four sat quietly once more. No one was fully sure what they could and could not say, what would be too much and what would be not enough. Then, just as the wave of disappointment and realisation started to wash over her, Gwen shrugged it off. “Why did you send that message?”

Kaine looked out at the street before him. It was easy to tell who was a tourist and who was a local based on who tripped on the cobblestone streets. “I have… a lot of memories of before the cloning. I remember a lot, actually. I remember… my parents’ funeral. I remember being taken in by Aunt May and Uncle Ben.” He swallowed hard and nodded. “I remember Uncle Ben dying.”

Somewhere deep within her, Mary felt the urge to reach out and grab Kaine’s hand, but she fought it off.

“And I know those things didn’t happen to me,” he continued. “They’re transplanted memories. I guess you could call them fake, I don’t know. But they feel… real. They feel like mine. So when I remembered it was Aunt May’s birthday, it felt like the right thing to do.” He took one last long sip of coffee, placing the finished mug down with a thud. “Just because I know it wasn’t really ‘me’ in those memories, doesn’t mean I don’t care for her.”

Gwen nodded. “I understand that. Believe me, I do.”

Felicia’s expression didn’t waver, but her shaking hands betrayed her. “We’re actually looking for Peter. I don’t suppose you—”

“Apart from the time I tried to whack him, like, five years ago…” Kaine shook his head. “At least, if he is here, I haven’t bumped into him yet. But I don’t know anything about him either way, so…” He shrugged.

Gwen drummed her fingers on the table whilst the others looked down in silence. This was, of course, far from the answer they wanted; never once did they entertain the idea of a second clone, but now that it was a reality, it seemed almost too surreal to believe. And yet, here he was, living proof.

“Well,” Mary began, her tone optimistic. “We came all this way. I guess first of all, thanks for messaging May. It’s… really brought her some light today.”

Kaine shrugged, but his eyes shimmered.

“We’d love to know about you.” Mary looked to the others to confirm, to which the others enthusiastically nodded. “Anything you’d want to share?”

Kaine bit his tongue for a moment or two before sucking in a breath. “I was… stuck in an Alchemax lab, first and foremost. Ended up getting rescued.” He leaned back in his chair. “Took down the lead scientist who just so happened to be mutated into a swarm of bees at the time.”

Gwen’s look of shock was hard to ignore, to which Kaine added with a tilt of his head, “Also, he was a Nazi.”

“Uh huh,” Gwen muttered, more alarmed than confused by now.

Kaine continued: “I’ve done a lot of… I don’t know what you’d call it. Soul-searching?” He raised his hands, gesturing with air quotes as he said, ‘Finding myself’?” He sighed. “I suppose almost leaving the people who rescued you for dead requires you to look inside yourself somewhat.”

Mary found herself smiling. It was a comfort to see how open Kaine was to them, as if the four of them had known each other for a long time. Though, as he continued his story, she watched as his eyes fell solely on her.

*Of course,* Mary realised. *He *has* known me for a long time.*

Kaine smirked slightly before straightening his face again. “Enough about me. I’ve heard mention of a Spider-Woman.” He looked at each of the women sitting in front of him before adding, “Don’t suppose this rings any bells?”

Mary softly nodded. “It does.”

And to that, Kaine nodded back. “Well. Nice to see.”

When another silence washed over the quartet, it felt less deafening and more of a comfort. There was a shared melancholy between them, each knowing what the three women had come here for and each knowing they were leaving without it. But as they felt the soft breeze blow through them, each lost in their own thoughts for a moment, the silence finally felt peaceful.

“Hey,” Kaine spoke up, breaking the silence. He leaned forward and pulled a $5 bill out of his pocket and slipped it under his coffee cup. “If there’s anything I’ve learned, it’s that you’ve gotta carve your own path. And I don’t mean only looking out for yourself. I mean, you gotta be what you wanna be, not what others make of you, y’know?”

The three women smiled. With a surprisingly sheepish smirk, Kaine bowed his head. “I hope you find what you’re looking for.”

And as he walked over the cobbled sidewalk and into the bustling market, Kaine disappeared into the crowd.

🔴⚪️🕷⚪️🔴
&nbsp;

Nighttime in Boston was surprisingly cold, and so the still warm hood of Mary’s car was a welcome source of heat for Gwen, Felicia, and Mary. A four-pack of beer sat on the grass below them, two of them having already been claimed by Mary and Felicia, and the rhythmic chirping of crickets cut through the otherwise stillness of the evening.

Gwen sat frantically scrolling through her phone. It was hard to access the NYPD database from a mobile phone, but it was her only option. She needed to find something - anything - that could indicate that the trip wasn’t a waste. But as Mary shuffled closer to her, a sigh escaping her mouth, she gestured to the tab Gwen was browsing through. “Gwen.”

“What?” Gwen did not look up from her phone.

“Take the night off,” Mary soothed. Her voice was calm but dejected. “Please.”

Gwen shook her head. The security footage of Peter at the gas station had led nowhere, but that didn’t seem right. He must have gone elsewhere. Would he have stayed in Connecticut, or could he have moved even further East? Could he…?

Then Gwen paused. Mary’s words finally sunk in, finally cutting through the noise in her brain. She took a deep breath in, held it, then let it out. “Okay,” she whispered.

Mary leaned forwards, retrieved a beer from the ground below, and passed it to Gwen.

The blonde woman clicked the can open and took a long swig, gulping it down. There was a pause. Then, with a shake of her head, Gwen scoffed, “Well, this was a bust.”

“Kaine seemed nice, at least,” Mary said.

“Seemed to like you,” Felicia teased, hiding her smile by taking a sip from her beer.

“Oh, hush,” Mary chuckled. But after a pause, her brow furrowed a little. “What if it was him in the CCTV footage?”

“Couldn’t have been,” Gwen replied. “Based on what he’s told us, I doubt he’s been that far West in years, let alone weeks. Not to mention, he looked completely different.”

Felicia tapped her nails against the hood of the car, the metallic thumping almost a hum. “So what’s the plan?”

Gwen took another sip of her beer. “The plan is, there is no plan.”

“Not for this Peter stuff,” Felicia added. “It’s clear we’ve got no plans for finding Peter. That’s why we’re sitting drinking beer in a field a half mile out of Boston.”

Mary chuckled, but Gwen rolled her eyes.

“Plan for what then?” Gwen asked.

“Y’know,” Felicia shrugged. “For everything. For life.”

There was a pause. No one wanted to be the first to speak, to lay out their plans for the rest of their lives, in front of the other two. But more to fill the silence than anything else, Mary cleared her throat.

“Ever since I fought alongside Ben,” she began. “I’ve felt this… spark, I guess you’d call it. When I first got these powers, I was terrified. Terrified of what they could do, of what it would do to me.” She stared down at the beer in her hands. “But getting to use them with Ben felt so… natural. Like that’s what I wanna do from now on, y’know?”

“You wanna be an actual Spider-Woman. A full-blown superhero.” Felicia grinned.

Mary winced. “I think we’re already passed that point,” she chuckled. “But… yeah, kinda. I wanna do good.”

“Alright, Gwen, your turn,” Felicia announced.

“What? But—” Gwen huffed. “Alright. Well, I wanna do music. I love playing the guitar, I’m starting to pick up the drums, I know quite a bit of bass.” She took a sip of her beer, buying herself time to think. “I guess I’d like to be in a band.”

“You totally should,” Mary remarked. “What’s stopping you?”

Felicia stirred.

“My dad,” Gwen admitted. “He… he doesn’t want me to ‘waste my potential’ when it comes to science. And apparently anything short of working in a lab 24/7 is wasting my potential. So imagine his face if I told him I wanted to join a band.”

Mary nodded sadly. “I’m sorry.”

“And, shit, I literally hacked into his NYPD database account,” she said, running a hand through her hair. “I went behind his back and I breached his trust. I…” She sighed. “I really wish I hadn't done it. I wish I’d found another way around this.”

“You doing that is the reason we have as much information as we do,” Mary reassured.

“But we’ve gotten nowhere, Mary. We don’t know where he is, we’re four hours away from New York City, and all we’ve got to show for it is a handful of footage of him walking or getting gas for his car.”

“This isn’t over yet,” Felicia said. “We’re still looking.”

Gwen breathed deeply. “Yeah. Yeah, you’re right.”

“What about you, Felicia?” Mary asked.

Felicia sat in the uncomfortable quiet for a moment before beginning. “Well, um… I recently got some bad news about my father.” She waved her hand dismissively. “I won’t give you all the gory details, but… he was my rock, really. And now, that’s a big part of me that I’m just not gonna have.” Felicia frowned. “So I guess my future is… learning to deal with that. At least, my immediate future is.”

Gwen looked up at Felicia and noticed her eyes glossy with tears. She reached over and placed a hand gently on her arm. “I’m sorry. I hope it gets better for you soon.”

Her words were kind, but Felicia couldn’t help but recoil somewhat in her head. It didn’t seem right to her - George Stacy was the reason Walter Hardy was in prison in the first place, and yet here was his daughter handing out pity. But she pushed down the thought; she was being too harsh on Gwen, she concluded.

“Y’know,” Gwen continued. “I was wondering why you were being so quiet. I mean, usually you’re so bossy and loud. Now, it makes sense.”

Felicia snapped her head round to look at Gwen. There it was again - that proud grin. She was *proud* of what she had said. Felicia’s eyes darted to Mary, who was looking at Gwen with surprise and shock.

“Oh, c’mon, Felicia. I was just kidding!” Gwen held her arms out and chuckled. “Take a joke, y’know?”

The simmering in Felicia’s mind was bubbling over. She felt her grip on her beer can tighten, felt the metal popping out of shape beneath her grip. She waited - seconds passed, then minutes - but Mary didn’t say anything. Felicia had seen the outrage in Mary’s face, and she knew that Mary had seen her own, and yet she allowed the comment to stand. And Gwen Stacy, her grin still plastered on her face, still radiating pride, had been allowed to get away with it.

Felicia breathed in. Maybe she wasn’t being too harsh on Gwen after all. Maybe, as she’d suspected, she had been right about Gwen all along. Maybe she was just like her father.

Felicia held her breath. Synapses were forming in her brain, connections being made, plans being created. She had an idea, a way for Gwen to understand all the hurt she and her family was causing. But how to set it into motion…

Finally, releasing her grip on the can, Felicia breathed out.

I don’t clean up after myself. I spend almost all of my time cleaning up the messes I just made. No one else can create such a shit show of a mess in a short period of time. I can’t even clean or organize without making it more messy as I go. You can find my mess breadcrumbs everywhere. Lid to my toothpaste, never gets just put on when I’m done using it. Cabinets doors? Forget it. There is never NOT a vacuum  in a random place, like the middle of my living room. Cooking, working, getting dressed, everything I do leaves a wake of mess destruction behind. I wear myself out. 

I switch tasks so frequently that anything that has multiple steps sequentially are really a struggle. Like making a cup of coffee in a Keurig.- first I fill the water, then I put my cup down, then I put the pod in, close it, and walk away to do something menial without being consciously aware. It’s like my brain just walks away before I get to the part where I have to push the size button and the start button. too many steps. When I want to listen to a song on Pandora, I have to open the app search for the song and then somehow my brain again walks away before I hit play Z 20 minutes later I will think to myself oh it’d be nice if I was listening to music, rinse and repeat. 
I really hate this part of me. 

I start a lot and finish very little. I’m always busy but never productive. Imagine being the toddler AND the mom. That’s me. ",5,1738389298.0,AuDHDWomen,1,1.0,False
1ieztco,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ieztco/update_after_7_years_my_then_29f_marriage_to_then/,"Update after 7 years: My (then 29F) marriage to (then 29M) is getting annulled in a few days, not sure what to do/think.","Hey everyone,

This is a 7-year overdue update, but I wanted to share how things turned out, so many years later. About seven years ago, I posted about [my marriage getting annulled](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8dxbne/my_marriage_is_getting_annulled_in_a_few_days_not/). That post is likely gone now, so here’s a quick recap of the main issues:

1 - Children: I made it clear before marriage that I never wanted kids, ever. My ex agreed, but the moment we married, he pressured me relentlessly, every single day. He would put a stuffed toy under my shirt and say, isn’t it nice to be pregnant, or say it would be so cute to have a lil child clinging to my legs etc. He also suggested getting a dog which he later admitted was to  ""encourage my maternal instincts"" and then threatened to return her when I didn't change my mind.

2 - Other women: At a work event, a woman leaned on him, insisted on having dinner at our table, and later invited him to join her in her room’s jacuzzi (right in my face). He claimed she was ""crazy"" and that he didn’t know her, then changed his tune to he barely knew her, but I checked his messages and found out they had been having breakfasts and coffee together for a long time. There were more incidents like this, including him gaming just to meet a girl he had a crush on. Or asking out two girls he used to have a crush on out of spite (I asked him if I could meet a guy friend, he said no, then threw a fit that I even asked. I should have known better than to ask, apparently) and refusing to cancel until I had a meltdown. 

3 - No responsibility: He had cheated on all his exes and called them ""crazy."" When I finally lost it and screamed at him, he told me I scared him and refused to acknowledge his part in our problems. He wouldn’t stop seeing the coworker who started our issues, insisting it was ""important for networking."" They are not even in the same department. In marriage counseling, I told him I'd consider kids if he created a concrete 18-year plan for their care. He refused, saying, ""Just have the child, then we'll deal with it."" The counselor sided with me, but he stormed out and never went back.

4 - My emotional struggles: I behaved badly too - I had issues regulating my emotions, often screaming, crying, and once throwing books in frustration. I look back and cringe in  shame and embarrassment.

There were more problems, so many of them, but these were the biggest issues. I was lost, heartbroken, and overwhelmed. Reading the comments was hard, and I think I deleted the post eventually to avoid facing them. 

To the commentors:

To the redditors who were kind and rational in their comments, thank you. Most of you told me to leave and that the marriage was toxic. That was hard to hear at the time, but you were so right.

To the few who were rude: yes, wanting children is okay, but forcing someone who doesn’t, tricking them into marriage, isn't. And to the guy who implied my ex paid for everything, no, he didn’t. My parents helped me with my Master’s fees. We went halfsies on the house, everything. Also, the person who suggested I had bipolar disorder - diagnosing a stranger online is irresponsible. I’m now a psychologist, and no, I don’t have bipolar disorder (it’s a tough, lifelong condition. I really feel for those who have it). Emotional dysregulation happens for many other reasons.

Going through with the annulment:

The annulment only confirmed my decision. My ex gaslit me constantly, to the point where I had to keep an evidence list to remind myself of the truth. He falsely accused me of stealing money from our accounts, when all I did was take back wedding gift money from my family. Which he also did. He lied to a lawyer about my financial contributions, saying I paid only 60 dollars for the house, but I had bank records proving otherwise (I paid 70 000). His self-righteous lies were often so convincing that even I doubted myself at times. Referring to my evidence record sheet really helped!

Where I’m at:

I’m now in a healthy, loving marriage with a husband who makes me feel safe and cherished in ways I never imagined. We’ve been together 6+ years (yes we met very shortly after my annulment, so glad things worked out), and every day just keeps getting better. He’s kind, intelligent, funny, and thoughtful and, yes, handsome to boot. We have deep conversations about philosophy, sci-fi, and meaning of life, art, everything. He’s everything my ex wasn’t, and I see now how much happiness I would’ve missed if I had fought for that old marriage and stayed. Even if my ex had ""worked on things,"" he would never have been able to fulfill me the way my husband does.

Therapy (both self-guided and with other professionals) helped me grow tremendously. I’ve calmed down and learned to manage my emotions. The worst thing I do now when angry is raise my voice slightly or whine—no more screaming, no losing control, no helpless sobbing. Absolutely no name-calling. Turns out, a lot of my emotional struggles came from feeling unheard and trapped in a toxic marriage, with someone who was convinced he was god's gift to women. Being in a great marriage with a wonderful person really does wonders for emotional regulation and wellness!

I guess I just really wanted to say, if you’re in a bad relationship, please, PLEASE don’t stay out of fear. Being alone can be terrifying. But nothing is worse than being trapped in misery. For life.  

Looking back, I can’t believe I didn’t see how necessary it was to leave. People say Redditors love jumping to ""break up,"" but now that I’m in a wonderful, stable marriage, I get it. When you’re with the right person, everything feels different. You look at someone stuck in a bad situation and all you think is, why do people accept such treatment? Things could be so much better if they left. I then remind myself that I was once like that too, accepting the worst situations because leaving was too hard.

If you're in a bad relationship, please leave, it’s not worth it. Know that there *is* something better out there. Don’t let fear keep you from finding it. I’m proof of it, and honestly even if I had ended up single forever, I can tell you that I would prefer that. In the few months I was single, I realised how bad things were when I went to bed just being glad that there wasn’t a new argument or betrayal to discover. Do what is right for  you, not what is easy!

1ieznim,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ieznim/mfemployee_of_the_month/,[MF]Employee of the Month,"It started at 2:00 AM, when Barry quietly hung a frame on the wall.

The Gas ’n Go Emporium had never had an Employee of the Month board. Because no one had ever cared enough to start one.

But tonight, Barry had decided it was time.

The frame was black and professional-looking. The photo inside was a standard employee headshot, slightly grainy.

It depicted a very normal-looking man in a Gas ’n Go uniform.

The plaque beneath the photo read:

“GREG - EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH”


On his way to the break room, Frank stopped mid-step when he saw the frame.

He squinted.

Then took a slow sip of coffee.

Then squinted again.

Tina, already behind the counter with her Styrofoam cup, didn’t even look up. “Just keep walking.”

Frank pointed at the wall. “Who the hell is Greg?”

Tina sighed. “You’re engaging with it. Don’t engage with it.”

Frank turned to Barry, who was casually arranging candy bars into a shape that looked vaguely like an ancient sigil. “Who’s Greg?”

Barry smiled. “Greg is our best employee.”

Frank stared at him. “We don’t have a Greg.”

Barry nodded approvingly. “Yes. And yet, Greg remains Employee of the Month.”

Frank exhaled slowly through his nose. “No.”

Barry’s smile widened slightly. “Yes.”

Frank opened his mouth. Then closed it. Then, with the exhausted efficiency of a man who was simply not paid enough, he turned and walked away.



A tired-looking trucker paused in front of the wall.

He squinted at the photo. “Oh, yeah. Greg. He helped me out last week.”

Tina looked up slowly. “…No, he didn’t.”

The trucker frowned. “Sure he did. He rang me up. Good guy.”

Tina blinked twice. Then, without another word, she pressed the intercom button.

“Barry to the front.”

Barry appeared instantly.

Tina gestured at the trucker. “Fix it.”

Barry smiled. “Fix what?”

The trucker nodded at the picture. “Just saying Greg’s a good worker.”

Barry nodded approvingly. “Yes. Greg is an outstanding employee.”

Tina closed her eyes for a long, slow moment. Then took a sip of her coffee. “I need a raise.”



He made it exactly three feet into the store before his entire body tensed.

His eyes locked onto the Employee of the Month photo.

Slowly, he approached it. Studied it. His breathing became shallow.

Then, finally, he turned toward Barry.

“Where did Greg come from?”

Barry smiled. “He’s always been here.”

Chad inhaled sharply through his nose. “NO HE HASN’T.”

Barry’s smile didn’t waver.

Chad’s gaze darted to Tina. “You SEE it, right? That’s not a real person!”

Tina didn’t even look up from her coffee. “Nope.”

Chad pointed aggressively at the frame. “NOPE, WHAT? NOPE YOU DON’T SEE IT, OR NOPE YOU WON’T ACKNOWLEDGE IT?”

Tina took another sip. “Yes.”

Chad turned back to Barry, eyes wide. “Who. Is. Greg.”

Barry folded his hands neatly. “Greg is our most valuable team member.”

Chad let out a frustrated half-scream, half-laugh. “VALUABLE TEAM MEMBER OF WHAT?! HE’S NOT REAL, MAN!”

Barry’s voice was calm. “And yet, customers remember him.”

Chad stared at the trucker still drinking coffee by the window.

The trucker gave him a lazy thumbs-up. “Greg’s a good guy.”

Chad visibly struggled to process this. He yanked his phone from his pocket, turned on the camera, and snapped a photo of the wall.

Then he looked at the picture.

The frame was there.

The plaque was there.

But there was no face in the photograph.

Chad made a strained, wheezing noise somewhere between panic and existential collapse.

Then he shoved his phone into his pocket and power-walked out of the store.



Frank reappeared with a fresh cup of coffee and the dead eyes of a man who had made peace with death.

He stared at the Employee of the Month photo for a long, long time.

Then, with the sigh of someone fully done with reality, he took the frame off the wall.

He turned it over.

There was no backing.

No hooks.

No photo inside.

Just a blank, empty frame.

Frank flipped it back around.

Greg’s face was still there.

Frank’s grip tightened slightly. Then, still staring at the frame, he took a slow sip of coffee. “Okay.”

Then, without hesitation, he put the frame face-down on the floor and stepped over it.

Tina gave an approving nod. “Atta boy.”


Barry quietly picked up the frame and put it back on the wall.

Tina watched him do it.

“You’re just gonna put it back, huh?”

Barry smiled. “Of course. Greg deserves recognition.”

Tina sighed. “I need to find a new job.”

Barry’s smile widened. “You never will.”

Tina took a long, slow sip of coffee.

What even is 'earning your position'? Is it just about going to the right colleges and getting a degree? Because if that's the case, then Mike shouldn't be a lawyer either. But he is, and everyone's cool with it.

No one on the show is perfect, including Donna. She's messed up, but she's also helped the firm (and Harvey, Jessica, Louis, Mike, and Rachel individually) a ton. For me Donna's one of the core members of the firm and not just a glorified coffee fetcher from the very beginning. After all the times she's saved the firm's bacon (and Harvey's, let's be real), sticking her in a secretary's role by the end of it is just a slap in the face.

Hey everyone, I’ve been searching for a part-time job since September, but I haven’t heard back from anywhere. I keep applying, at least once a month, but it feels like I’m getting nowhere.

A bit about my situation:

* I don’t have a car, so I’d prefer to work in **Redmond or Crossroads**, near the **B Line bus route**.
* I don’t have restaurant experience, but I do have **volunteering experience**, like moving things around and teaching.
* A lot of jobs I’ve found **require or prefer prior work experience**, which makes it even harder to land something.

I’m wondering—**is the job market just that competitive right now?** Or am I doing something wrong? Any **tips for finding income,** even outside traditional part-time jobs? I really just need something to **help with rent and school.**

For those of you who’ve job-hunted recently, what was your experience like? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

*Nitrate Dreams* is a concept album to be released by [Buck’s Harbor](https://bucksharbor.bandcamp.com/). Each track will take its name and inspiration from the title of a lost silent-era film.

The notion is to collaborate with poets, who will pick titles from [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ZnldH-FLGUHw_6auaqcdGZ7Ql2SL7lcU6Sj0k_WquA/edit?usp=sharing), and submit rhyming verse to be set to music by Ethan Warren of Buck’s Harbor for the album. The list will be updated as submissions come in, and titles will be crossed off as they’re filled by poets. The demo of the first track, C.M. Crockford’s “The Heiress at Coffee Dan’s”, can be streamed [here](https://s.disco.ac/svreuqjenyww).

This album will be distributed for free—nobody pays for music anymore, do they? Thus, there won’t be any profits to split. This is a strictly for-fun venture, and should be entered into with a spirit of play rather than getting rich and famous.

It is a bright afternoon, and the sun is shining. It feels like the perfect time for coffee. I warm up some water and prepare the ground coffee. Inspecting the mug, I take it to the wash basin, which isn’t too far away. I place three scoops of coffee into the machine and switch it on, adding five cups of water. It’s a very hot day, which is rather odd. This phenomenon began years ago as a solar storm. Nevertheless, a young man must prepare to step forward with faith and strength.



I walk into my small room made of shredded wood and adhesive—a product of our national pulp industry and mathematics in construction. Making every day count and attending to my work assignment, I have prepared my boots, a backpack, and a notebook—my essentials. I keep a few clothes on a budget, as I need to maintain a presence in the job market.



After taking a shower, I realize I have run out of razors, so I use a clipper to buzz my hair. Visiting the barber has become too expensive, and I haven’t attracted the female attention I had hoped for, so I settle for a clean look.



I notice I’m low on hygiene supplies. While it’s time for errands, the outside world poses dangers. I make a mental list of what I need: razors, soap, and toothpaste. I undress and prepare a simple change of clothes for when I finish. The properties of the water droplets are amazing—cool and relieving. I say a prayer and thank my God for this gift and these moments of hope. After dressing and brushing my teeth, I focus on my job search.



I’ve submitted applications and called almost every place in the city. I turn on the TV and see politicians and advertisements filled with colors and new products. It’s been a while, and I’m still looking for work, which concerns me.



I consider walking to the store to buy a box of cigarettes, craving nicotine. I don’t have a fancy home; it’s put together with scrap wood and hidden relics of steel imports. There’s a simple chair I use to sit and my bed to lie in.



I walk back to the coffee pot. The coffee is rich, and I decide to add creamer until it turns a creamy light color. I’m running out of sugar. I think about making music, taking notes, having fun, advertising, laughing, and exploring new ideas.



I open the door to see the bright sun in the morning. The air is red and yellow. It’s another day—rather dull, but I have to be patient and observe the heat. I think about making art in my spare time and painting to stay inside, hoping to reduce violence.



I’ve had my way in the kitchen, listening to the commotion outside. I anticipate pounding headaches, knowing bills are due. My common sense leads me to tolerate it, and I can see the remains of old paydirt. The sun shines through the window. My life feels like a pawn in a game I understand—the mechanics of it all.



I pick up the Bible and read a couple of scriptures after having my coffee, feeling important as I absorb my lecture. Dizzy, confused, and frightened, I walk the short path to my room and reach for my pen and notebook. I place my Bible and scriptures in a safe place. I aim to take notes on my location and priorities.



I think, ""I'll show it to you. I'll give it to others. I will take it for myself."" It feels uncomfortable and painful. I ponder what the day could hold—should I head north, south, or navigate family responsibilities?



At this moment, I feel haunted by responsibility. I look at the colors outside, think about my chores, and worry about intruders. I wish for a time away from this confusion, to take my disadvantages and find sanity.



I look around, intoxicated and unable to recover from the day—not poisoned, harassed, assaulted, or humiliated. I seek a way to earn a dollar, holding onto my documents. Unfortunately, our location is plagued by issues in our culture: robbers, sick people, drug addicts, murderers, and molesters. It’s a luxury to sleep on the floor or even to own a bed.



It’s a scene to be a normal person on foot, heading to buy groceries. ""Oh, the corruption,"" I think; it’s so unpleasant. There’s obviously some kind of trouble brewing. I choose to avoid this riot and the violence, as obscenities and rumors threaten. People shout, ""He is not going to stop!"" and ""A terrorist event will not be investigated.""



Listening and paying attention, I take my chair and place it back against the wall. I pour the last of my coffee into the wash basin, reflecting on my thoughts of art. Why not depict something taboo, like crime by the waterway? Nauseated and aroused, I want to vomit. The noises—yelling, sex, and chaos—continue. I use running water to comfort myself, hoping the fight will end and I’ll stop being frightened.



What a nightmare! Eventually, the noise subsides. My focus returns to debris, rocks, metal, and sand outside the window. I see the black sky and moon, take a few steps, and feel ready to step outside and look up at the bright night sky.



What a beautiful illustration! This impressive structure is baffling and inspiring for modern works, churches, prophets, and our Temple. The day ends, and I walk up three steps into my home, go to bed, and dream about the hill in our town, the decorations, the art galleries, and my plunder.



The next day begins with the sun’s beams, suffocating heat, and a pounding headache. I can only imagine the source of this headache might be due to my wild nightmares of violence and wicked plots of terrorism. They make no sense to me.



Now, my focus is on finding protein. I need food. ""Oh goodness, another day,"" I think. ""What blessings await me?"" Socialist filth and rumors, more communist turf wars to navigate. I hold my books close and keep the promise of the scriptures in my heart. ""I pray every day. I make every effort to avoid mischief,"" I tell myself.



""It is a battle."" The idea of complete ownership and rival groups controlling essentials for survival gnaws at me. My life revolves around this nationalistic understanding of social life and labor militias. Sometimes I find myself alone, with no company to assist in my immediate needs.



I remind myself: ""It is a battle.""

1iez6rt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CursedPrincessClub/comments/1iez6rt/cursed_princess_club_ocs/,Cursed Princess Club OCs,"Hello there. These are some OCs I made for this fandom. Of course, some of them are inspired by classic fairytales and mythology.

First of is Princess Odalis. She comes from a kingdom that worships a magical lake. Unable to have children, the king and queen prayed to the lake for a child. They got their wish, and a child was drawn up from the lake for them. She has white hair that looks like swan feathers. She's beloved by her subjects for her beauty and kindness, as well as being made from the very lake they worshipped. When not performing her princessly duties or learning, she prefers to spend her time by the lake, interacting with the birds that reside there. On her 13th birthday, she suddenly transformed into a swan. When the sun set, she transformed back into a human. What was thought to be a fluke turned out to not be the case, since the very next day she transformed into a swan again. It is believed that this was the price given when the wish was made. With this revelation came many concerns, such as running a kingdom and finding a suitable suitor. Odalis was determined to prove she could still be queen one day. Through hard work, she learned to be able to write using her bill and was able to communicate through honks that could be understood and translated. One day, while hanging out by the lake in swan form, a hunter shot her and she almost died. In fear, her parents forbid her from leaving the castle, which led to a time of depression for the princess and her kingdom by extension. Luckily, a better solution came. Prez learned about Odalis and came to offer a safe haven for their daughter in the Cursed Princess Club and where she could hopefully learn to control her curse. Her parents reluctantly agreed, wanting the best for their daughter. She is friends with Princess Monika due to having bird-related curses, and is also friends with Mimi since they were both born from a wish (more on her later). As you can guess, Odalis is inspired by the Swan Lake story.

Next up are twin sisters, Princess Talia and Somnia. They are based off of the story of Sleeping Beauty, with Talia being named after the princess from one version of the story called The Sun, the Moon, and Talia. Hailing from the Linen Kingdom, the twins were both cursed on the  day of their christening by a fairy who was mad that she wasn't invited. Talia, the eldest twin, was cursed with never being able to sleep, and her younger sister Somnia was cursed with always being sleepy or tired.

Talia is usually taking care of her sister in some way, making sure she is safe and being a shoulder for her to nap on. Because of her inability to sleep, she spends the night hours reading, learning or doing some sort of hobby, and even talking with the guards who are on night watch. Because she spent so much time on various activites, she is rather educated and talented. Because of her beauty and skill, she has recieved  many suitors while Somnia had few. Because she refused to leave her sister behind, Talia turned down each and every suitor. On an outing in the woods, the sisters encountered the Cursed Princess Club. Talia was reluctant to join, but seeing her sister's happiness, she agreed to join.

Somnia is mostly either sleeping or half-asleep. Her preferred drink is coffee to keep herself somewhat awake. Despite her sleepiness, she is able to walk around familar places and do familiar tasks while sleeping. She can even form coherent and aware sentences while sleeping. Her only friend was her sister until she joined the Cursed Princess Club. She is also not the most popular sister, with suitors preferring her older sister. Her favorite story is Sleeping Beauty, since she can relate to the princess, longing for someone who will accept her like her sister does. She also loves animals and has been seen sleeping on animals, even a bear. I guess I was also slightly inspired by the Princess from Sleeping Princess in A Demon Castle.

Princess Letty, real name Lethe, was an average princess. One day, she was poisoned and although she didn't die, the poison affected her memory, making her unable to retain any memory. To alleviate this, she writes her memories in her diary. She got lured into the woods one day by her parents, who abandoned her there. They pretended she was dead. Without her diary, Letty couldn't remember who she was and why she was in the woods. After wandering for who knows how long, she finally found the Cursed Princess Club, who welcomed her in and given a new notebook to keep her memories in. She was eventually found by her childhood friend and crush, Prince Zakar (which means to recall or remember), who helped her remember who she was. The name Letty is actually a nickname he gave her.

Princess Kaida isn't a cursed princess, but she is a princess born from unusual circumstances. Long ago, her father, crown prince of the Chainmail Kingdom, was sent to slay a dragon. However, much to the kingdom's disappointment, instead of killing the dragon, he fell in love with her and began courting her. As king, he married the dragon and made her his queen. Through their union, Kaida was born. Mostly human-looking, she has curved dragon horns, claws in place of fingernails, wings, a tail, and is covered with dragon scales. When she was a child, her mother was killed by dragon hunters. Fearing for her safety, her father sent her to a remote castle, where she was taken care of by loyal servants. Being isolated, she grew lonely and wanted a normal life. At times, she would resent for parents because she was born this way. Sometimes, she would even hate her mother because she died and left her. Prez managed to find the castle and offer a safe space for her where she would be both free and safe. Along with her dragon features, she can breathe fire, fly, and she does hoard gold to make her bed. 

Princess Midina was, of course, inspired by King Midas. Her family has a long backstory, which I will explain in a different post. Long story short, she was born to a greedy and evil king, King Pyrite of the Gold Kingdom. Fittingly, she was born with the ability to turn anything into gold, which he used to make himself wealthier. When she doesn't want to make things gold, she wears a pair of magical gloves (which are colored gold) so she can touch things. Her father would keep making her turn things gold. Being a princess with gold-making abilities she had many, many suitors who, or their parents, wanted to make themselves wealthier. Hating her ""gift"", Midina tried many ways to get rid of it (even to the point of, well let's just say she has scars). One day, Prez found her and tried to rescue her and her younger sister. King Pyrite wouldn't allow his gold mines to be taken away, so he fought back. Finally, Midina couldn't take it anymore, and used her magic to turn her own father into gold, thereby freeing her, her sister, and the Gold Kingdom from his tyranny. 

Now I'm going to talk about Midina's little sister, Gemma, who is a few years younger than Gemma. Gemma was also born with a special wealth-making ability. In her case, she is able to make gems when she cries, replacing tears (essentially like Yukina from Yu Yu Hakusho). Because the only way to get the gems out was to make her cry, her father would emotionally abuse her in order to get her crying. One time, he even gave her a pet puppy, only to unalive it in front of her. Like her sister, she also had many suitors who just wanted her for her abilities. She is usually rather scared and unhappy to due how she was raised. As stated above, she was rescued by Prez and Midina after she turned their father into gold.

Finally, I'm going to wrap up with a princess I call Princess Meta. She claims she is cursed, saying she is able to see text boxes, see beyond the world into another, and even know things so one should know. As is obvious, she is cursed with meta awareness, which allows her to see narration, break the fourth wall, and know she is in a webcomic. However, no one believes her. 

I have other OCs, but I have written a lot, so this'll be it for now.

1iez63j,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagofood/comments/1iez63j/the_past_alinea_year_1_tasting_menu_at_next/,"""The Past - Alinea Year 1"" tasting menu at Next (January 2025).","I went for the ""The Past - Alinea Year 1"" tasting menu at Next and was excited to see how it compared to my recent kitchen table experience at Alinea. I left somewhat disappointed. **7.5/10 overall.**

**Note:** I went during the menu's debut week, so it will likely undergo some refinement later. I hope it does, anyway.

**Food - 7.5.** Perhaps ironically, I felt this was a quintessential example of the top Alinea criticism - style over substance. I'd give the food a 7 on its own, but felt the creative, multisensory presentation justified a small boost, although I found this significantly less successful than at its namesake. The courses were hit-or-miss for me, with a few bold standouts (hot potato, explosion, lobster, lamb neck), one I found inedible (frog legs - though the rest of my party seemed fine with it), and plenty of others that were just *fine*. I was expecting more than *fine* from an Alinea-inspired menu comprised of some of their greatest hits. The interactive presentation of some dishes made them challenging to eat - and not in a fun, pushing-the-limits-of-fine-dining way, but just plain awkward in my opinion. (And for anyone wondering, the only repetitive dishes between my Alinea and Next visits this week were hot potato and explosion.)

**Drinks - 4.** I didn't love Next's non-alcoholic pairing when I tried it previously, but I decided to give it another go. Regrettably, I liked it even less this time. The textures were generally pleasant (with the exception of one glass featuring rice milk and pine), but I found too many of the drinks cloyingly sweet or overpowering. I didn't feel that they paired particularly well with the food. On a positive note, I really enjoyed the complimentary beverage they offered us at the start of the evening - it was crisp and bubbly and I really should have just stuck to that.

**Service - 9.** Service was professional yet warm, with several members of the staff happy to engage with our table and answer our (sometimes silly) questions about the unique tableware and tools. The course descriptions were thorough and provided helpful context about their importance to Chef Achatz. We had an especially wonderful sommelier who presented multiple pairings simultaneously with grace. As this was the very first week of this brand new menu with some intricate tableside setup required, the staff was clearly still getting used to some of the finer details, but that didn't bother me personally.

**Ambiance - 8.** The lighting this time was much brighter, which I appreciated. I think the closeness of the tables diminished some of the delight of the presentations - it was simply too easy to glance over and spoil the surprise of the upcoming courses. Aside from that, everything was clean and comfortable enough.

**Would I go again?** Despite not being thrilled this time around, yes, I still plan to return for their next menu (""The Present - Tribute to Massimo Bottura"") because it sounds intriguing and will be an entirely different concept.

**Note:** The bill includes an automatic 20% service charge (including gratuity). This is clearly indicated on the receipt, although there's still room to provide additional tip if desired.

I used non fat greek yogurt, one large egg and 1.5 tbsp of corn starch. Also added 5 g of vanilla protein powder to add thickness and sweetness. And one tbsp of sugar free vanilla coffee syrup, and vanilla extract (a dash). Too much vanilla I know but the frozen blueberries on top (melted in the microwave) balance it out completely!! 


Baked for 50 minutes at 350 in a water bath and refrigerated overnight! The texture was sooooo cheesecake-y i was shocked!

Clarence and Jeff were also riding their bikes with the hybrid. It was seven thirty in the evening, the sun had just gone down in California and it was chilly outside, but Steven was used to it by now, having been living here for five years and he wasn't bothered by it anymore.

Steven was comfortably wearing a thin red jacket, blue jeans, and a pair of white Converse. They've made it to his home in West Hollywood. Steven looks at it, to him. It will never get old seeing Sumo's home.

His home wasa sleek, minimalist facade with clean lines and a combination of materials.

The primary materials seem to be concrete, glass, and wood.

A prominent feature is the wooden door, centrally located on the ground floor.

Large windows provided ample natural light and a sense of openness.

There is a balcony on the upper floor that has glass railings, offering outdoor space and a view of the surrounding area.

The roof is flat, consistent with modern architectural styles.

The front yard is well-maintained with green grass and various plants.

Small shrubs and plants were lining the pathway and the front of the house.

The driveway and pathway are designed with concrete slabs separated by strips of green grass, creating a visually appealing pattern.

The property is surrounded by mature trees, providing privacy and a natural setting. Trees and foliage add to the aesthetic appeal and offer shade.

It is enclosed by a modern fence made of concrete and horizontal slats, which match the contemporary style of the house.

There is a sliding gate for vehicle access and a pedestrian gate for walking access.

The house is situated in a lush, green neighborhood with sidewalks and mature trees.

The street appears to be quiet and residential, with similar-styled houses likely in the vicinity.

The house exudes a modern and luxurious vibe, with a focus on clean lines, natural materials, and integration with the surrounding landscape.

Steven Clarence and Jeff set their bikes on the grass and knocked on the door.

Sumo's mother, Tinona Sumouski opens the door and has a smile on her face.

""Well, if it isn't Steven Quartz Universe!"" she smiles.

""Hi Mrs. Sumouski!"" Steven greets her with a smile of his own.

""Sumo is in the livin' room. Oh, And Steven. We ordered you cheese pizza, are you okay with that, honey?""

""Yeah,"" Steven said, He gave Tinona smiled softly at the boy as they went inside, Sumo was watching Cartoon Network in the living room.

Sumo stood up from the dark brown U-shaped couch and ran up. ""Hey, guys! Steven! I can't wait to watch the third episode!"" he said excitedly. Steven smiled and gave him a fist bump.

""Taner is bringing the pizzas, boys, he should be here in a bit. Why won't you boys sit in the livin' roomand play or watch cartoons until he comes back."" she smiles and kisses her son on his head.

""Okay, Mom!"" he said, he saw his mother walk into the kitchen.

Jeff undid his sandals and placed them neatly by the door. Steven took off his shoes and did the same and he ran and jumped over the back of the couch and sat on it.

""Just in ninety minutes is going to come on! Teen Titans is on…"" Sumo stopped himself and looked at the big screen TV, that played a few commercials. ""It was on,"" he said.

Just then the door opened. A teen walked in holding two boxes of pizza in his hands. This is the first time that Steven has met one of his older brothers before.

His facial features resemble those of his older brother, Joseph. He has shoulder-length blonde hair with bangs that cover his eyes, and he has a well-built muscular body shape. Also, he wore a white shirt, and dark navy blue jeans with gray Adidas sneakers.

""Hey, Sumo! I got your pizzas!"" he said, going into the living room and setting them on the glass coffee table.

""Aw, yeah!"" The hybrid said, opening the box, and revealing pepperoni.

""Tanner you goof, Steven is vegetarian!"" Sumo said.

""There's another box underneath, stupid!"" Tanner rolled his eyes, grabbed the box with the first pizza, and setit aside. He opened the next box and saw it was cheese pizza.

""Oh, I thought you'd forgotten,"" he said, smiling at Tanner sheepishly. ""Sorry.""

""Ah, it's okay little dude, you didn't know!"" he said, walking to the kitchen and grabbing some plates for him and his friends.

A few minutes later, he came back with four plates in his hands. ""Hey, Tanner where is Joseph?"" he asked. Tanner set the plates down on the coffee table and sat with them.

""He's with his friends. And the rest are going to watch the show in their rooms. Steven, it's awesome that you get to do this! I'm so jealous!"" he said. Watching the screen.

""Just then, their bumper appeared, Steven wanted to know how they did on it.

""It's starting!"" He said as his eyes went starry and picked up a slice of cheese pizza and ate it.

On the other hand, there are several small objects, including a miniature washing machine, a small building, a clothesline with clothes hanging on it, and some other small items. The background is a light, dreamy landscape with soft colors and abstract shapes.

The title of the episode, ""CHEESEBURGER BACKPACK,"" is prominently displayed in large, playful letters. The text ""Written and storyboarded by Ian Jones-Quartey and Rebecca Sugar"" is also visible below the title. The overall aesthetic is whimsical and colorful, suggesting a fun and imaginative theme for the episode.

""CHEESEBURGER BACKPACK!"" Steven chanted, watching the episode that he's made with the team.

…

They were finished with the episode, Steven fell asleep on the couch. Sumo smirked. ""Hey, guys. Steven fell asleep again, let's prank him."" the boy said, laughing.

""Let's do it!"" Clarence laughed. They all ran upstairs and went into his parent's bedroom. Mel was lying on the sheets of his master bed, on his laptop. Mel had earbuds in so he couldn't hear them. As they went into the bathroom they grabbed a can of shaving cream. They all went downstairs.

""What are you guys doing?"" Tanner said. Walking to the kitchen to put the pizza boxes in the fridge.

""We're pranking Steven!"" Sumo said, walking behind the couch and leaning over it, the sleeping hybrid had his right leg hanging on the couch. Sumo lifted his shirt, exposing his Rose Quartz gem, Sumo put a bunch of shaving cream on it and tickled his stomach above his navel.

Steven smacks the spot and his eyes open and he shoots up. ""What the heck!"" he exclaimed.

""It was Sumo's idea!"" Clarence said, pointing to him.

""What! it was your idea!""

""It wasn't me, it was Sumo's idea honest!"" he said. Steven jumped from the couch and chased his friend.

""This is for the sword incident!"" he tackled him to the ground and started tickling him. Sumo laughed, he laughed so hard that his sides hurt.

Clarence threw a pillow at Steven, Steven's head turned back to the boy, and he stood up.

""You think you guys can prank me? Well… THIS. MEANS. WAR! PILLOW FIGHT!"" Steven and the boys armed themselves with pillows and started hitting each other.

…

The next morning, Steven was eating breakfast with his friends, Clarence, Jeff, and Sumo. Steven was eating cereal as Cartoon Network played on the big screen TV in the living room.

Steven was texting Connie, they were going to hang out today when Steven left Sumo's house laterthis afternoon. Steven was wearing a different shirt while he was in the laundry. He was now eating breakfast.

Steven was on his bike now, he just left Sumo's house, his jacket was in his backpack, and he went to Connie's house which was in Calabasas. Steven went home to put his bike away, he was not riding to Calabasas, as it would take too long. He went inside the house, and he saw his mother on the couch, on her iPad.

""Mom? Can you take me to Connie's house?"" Rose looked up and smiled.

""Sure I can, let me get my shoes,"" she said, walking upstairs and grabbing her flip-flops, she walked back down and grabbed the keys to her car.

I ran to my room and locked it. Now she’s outside, banging the fucking door like a psycho.

And this isn’t new. Indian parents act like their kids are their property. They can hit, scream, control every move we make. 


My dad never lays a hand on me, but my mom is another story.

And here’s this: my parents love me. They work hard for me. They try to give me everything. So I can’t even say I’m a “victim.” But what do you call it when someone loves you and still treats you like shit? Because I don’t know anymore.

1iez1hc,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1iez1hc/started_college_recently/,Started college recently,"I’m starting early (I’m 16) and as a homeschool kid I never really got much social interaction outside of some childhood friends. But now that I’m around people all week, I’m so excited that I’m not an antisocial anxious mess. I’m actually talking to people and making friends, and I lowkey don’t know how I wasn’t way more depressed while I was homeschooled.

On school days I meet people and I’m energized, but the weekend is just nothing and it’s kinda crazy how I spent my life like this.

Also due to my lack of experience, I have a hard time recognizing how people are feeling. And at the same time I have to be very conscious of the fact that I can’t crush on every person who seems interested in me(platonically).

Like a girl invited me to get coffee and donuts with her for our class, and I know it means nothing, and I know I don’t even have any reason to crush on her, so I actively have to stop myself from being interested in her cause I at least know it’s unhealthy to crush on everyone that is kind to me.

Regardless, I’m overall having so much fun meeting people and collecting contact info like Pokémon cards lol. Social anxiety slowly clearing up and I feel like my life is finally starting. Homeschool is like putting a tourniquet on social development. And if you leave it on for too long it dies and infects everything else.

If you intend on homeschooling, make social development your NUMBER ONE priority. That’s my rant🙏",2,1738386324.0,teenagers,2,1.0,False

Essential Kitchen Gadgets That Make Cooking Easier
--------------------------------------------------

Cooking can often feel like a chore, but with the right tools, you can make it a breeze. There are essential kitchen gadgets that can simplify your cooking experience, saving you time and effort while encouraging creativity in meal preparation. Here’s a look at a few must-have gadgets that could transform your kitchen into a more efficient workspace.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/gift-for-home-kitchen  
  
### Measuring Tools

Accurate measurements are crucial for successful cooking and baking. Investing in a set of measuring cups and spoons will help ensure that your recipes turn out as intended. Consider adding a digital kitchen scale to your arsenal, as it provides precise measurements, especially useful for baking. Being able to measure ingredients accurately means you can replicate your favorite dishes every time.

### Multi-Functional Vegetable Peeler

A good vegetable peeler can make the task of preparing fresh produce much simpler. Look for a multi-functional peeler that not only removes the skin from veggies but can also slice and julienne. This gadget allows you to whip up salads and stir-fries quickly by minimizing prep time. Plus, you can use it to add decorative touches to your dishes!

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/gift-for-home-kitchen  
  
### Food Processor

No kitchen is complete without a food processor. This versatile machine can chop, slice, dice, and mix, all in one bowl. Whether you’re making a quick pesto or preparing a batch of homemade hummus, a food processor speeds up the process and makes it easy. It’s an excellent investment for anyone who loves to cook or bake regularly.

### Slow Cooker

For busy home chefs, a slow cooker is a lifesaver. You can prepare meals early in the day, allowing them to cook over several hours while you go about your routine. Just throw in your ingredients, set the timer, and come home to a delicious, ready-made meal. Ranging from stews and casseroles to desserts, the options are endless!

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/gift-for-home-kitchen  
  
### Cast Iron Skillet

A cast iron skillet is a staple that deserves a spot in every kitchen. It’s perfect for everything from frying and searing to baking and roasting. With proper care, a cast iron skillet lasts a lifetime and even improves with age. It also retains heat exceptionally well, ensuring your food cooks evenly.

### Spiralizer

For those looking to add a healthy twist to their meals, a spiralizer is a fun and creative tool. It allows you to turn vegetables like zucchini and carrots into noodles, providing a low-carb alternative to traditional pasta. It’s not only a great way to incorporate more veggies into your diet, but it also makes for stunning presentations that make your meals more appealing.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/gift-for-home-kitchen  
  
### Instant Read Thermometer

Cooking meats can be tricky, but an instant-read thermometer takes the guessing out of the equation. Ensuring your favorite cuts of meat are cooked to the perfect temperature guarantees juicy and delicious results. It’s compact enough to store in a drawer and is invaluable when creating dishes for family and friends.

### Non-Stick Baking Mat

Baking can often lead to messy cleanup, but a non-stick baking mat could save you time and hassle. These mats are reusable, making them environmentally friendly and cost-effective. They keep your cookies from sticking to the baking sheet and ensure even baking, resulting in perfectly baked treats.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/gift-for-home-kitchen  
  
### Kitchen Tongs

No one wants to struggle with flipping food in a pan or grill. Kitchen tongs offer the perfect grip for handling hot items without risk of burns. Choose a pair that has silicone tips to protect your cookware from scratches. They’re great not just for cooking but also for serving salads or pasta.

### Colander with a Bowl

Draining pasta or washing veggies can be a messy task if you don’t have the right tools. A colander that includes a bowl makes it simple to catch any drips. It's perfect for rinsing your vegetables and then serving them directly from the same bowl.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/gift-for-home-kitchen  
  
With these essential kitchen gadgets, you can decrease the time and effort involved in cooking while enhancing the overall experience. Embrace the joy of cooking by equipping your kitchen with tools that inspire you to create delicious meals for yourself and your loved ones!

When it comes to selecting a gift for the home kitchen, the options are as varied as the cuisines we love to prepare. Whether you choose a creative gift that sparks joy and inspiration or an essential gadget that simplifies cooking tasks, each present offers a unique way to enhance the culinary experience. From innovative tools that aid in meal preparation to charming accessories that elevate kitchen aesthetics, the possibilities are endless.

If you’re uncertain about what to choose, consider the recipient’s cooking style and preferences. A beautiful set of measuring spoons or a personalized apron can add a personal touch, while high-quality knives or multi-functional appliances can be incredibly useful. Remember, the best gifts often combine thoughtfulness with practicality.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/gift-for-home-kitchen  
  
As you explore these ideas, think about how they can be integrated into daily cooking routines.

Ultimately, the right gift for the home kitchen should not only meet a need but also bring joy and inspiration to the cooking process.

1ieyw8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1ieyw8i/meet_me_in_sawyer/,Meet Me in Sawyer,"Hi L.

I will be there.

I know we have been full and dead silent NC for almost 90 days now. Though it's not lost on me that you unblocked me on almost every avenue of communication around New Years. I know you feel fear. Please, if you can try to understand me, I have to hold my own boundary of not breaking that barrier of communication with you by yet again reacting to slivers of half-action on your part, and taking the whole responsibility to initiate a dialogue with you. You have an established pattern of blocking me, then admitting to me that you undo that and watch over what little I do show to the world on social media. I'm not angry or judging, or going to hold that over you. I'm pointing it out because it's my belief that you believe I truly did love you. You know I hurt constantly and miss you and ruminate and at some level, wish you would just stop the background noise and reach out on your own accord. And it's also my belief that you feel the same as I do, no matter how you tried to portray me or your experience, to rewrite your own character, or who you spend time with to push me way back in the mirror.

Truth be told, I have not stopped loving you and my memories of you. Even if I felt I had to take a forked path that led me away from you in June. I wasn't getting reciprocal collaboration from you when I was mulling over my own interests and that of my other loved ones that decision. The splits just got worse. This was always intended to be a momentary move, not a permanent one. Still is. I did recognize that we had reached a point where we were locked into patterns of both doing things and reacting to things in ways which we thought would protect us individually, but caused harm to the other as the consequence. I meant what I said that I had to choose my blood family for a while and try to get who I am back underneath me. **And that I meant I believed it would lead me back home to you. My Bb.**

That caused you to feel again that I was going to abandon you. And like many of the other instances where your perception of my actions and my own words to you was influenced by your own emotional response, I felt my true rationale and intentions in action were not only prohibited from existing in a fair light, but actually turned into perception of gaslighting and assault when I would stand up for and draw boundaries around what was true about me and my thoughts.

**I want to let you know that, after all the back and forth, and questioning of what purpose it can, or might serve, I will be honoring that plan to travel to Sawyer on Feb 14th.**

I made that intention almost a year ago amidst some of the worst of the cycles we traveled through. I believe shortly after the Crosses show. One of the many times I put your utmost happiness to mind and tried to be a good friend, lover, and fiancée to you. And one of the many times that, sadly, I think your fears of being abandoned really got the best of us, and my fears of not being a good healer got the best of me, and turned gold into lead. I'm not saying this to levy blame or impart shame. I just want to be grounded and rational about how we got to the this place....that feels like a grave yard for the deepest love I ever felt.

I made that date so long ago, and it's purpose molded and bended along with the increasing severity of these cycles. At first, I did it to show you my intent to be with you a year from then, and expressly said that I thought your DBT courses and existing therapy would have had time to start providing coping strategies for both of us that could lead us to active communication, building trust, and showing reciprocity in how we feel and express emotions and needs, and how we receive them from each other.

After Memorial Day. After Lakes. After Russian Circles. And after Godspeed, (what was, in my perspective, a purposeful, and intentional fabrication of reality in order to assign horrible intentions upon me as a cover for some deep regret or shame in you.) This purpose morphed. In July, I figured I would be halfway through the lease in the place I left to, and by then we'd be making a solid bridgework into recombining and me planning to move back near you. After trying to be with you slid into dangerous accusations and portrayals, this has turned into something that is likely a culmination of my own ultimate sadness. With the same uncertainty of your participation as I constantly felt in our relationship. If this trip is my own to take, and I find myself alone, this trip to Sawyer will be a place to lie at rest symbolic wreaths and artifacts to my hopes and dreams with you in a place that both represents happy memories of our early times together, but also became part of a phrase of hope and for pause during the turmoil.

Much like ""Midnight"" ""Meet Me in Sawyer"" meant to me that you wanted us to remember that we loved each other, and that we could converge on a spot that was halfway between us. An actual equal compromise so that we could mend our ailments together. I still honor those phrases in my own grieving of you and of H and J and Ghost. I've left beloved keepsakes from each of you in the place that was the eclipse. Was my childhood home, but now one that means one of my last moments with you. I don't even think I can return to it anymore.

It's entirely possible you will see me at the show tomorrow night. Or the one on the 11th. (Go to Box 276 if so tomorrow) Maybe it's crazy of me to think that you will be there. I won't lie and say I won't be scanning around for you. Expecting you to show up with a new person and possibly intention to harm with dysregulation again. But I need you to know, if you are there, it's my full intention that we do not converse. Having to walk away from you will kill me inside, but I HAVE to keep firm on my need and vow for myself that I will not allow another cycle to begin in an environment that I did not welcome.

**Yes, I will be going to Sawyer on Feb 14th.**

Noon. You know the restaurant. We got goodies and fruit next door before heading out to the park. We stayed nearby and fucked like idiots and lounged and bathed and mused at the silliness of this world while, only speaking to me, I began to fall madly in love with you.

**This is of utmost importance L. I want you to be in Sawyer.** If you do choose to come, I must state both my hopeful intentions, and my realistic expectations of why I'm opening this channel of communication for us. And I also need to set my own boundaries for it for both of our measures of healing. I've spent a lot of time while I've been alone thinking on how boundaries are a set of expectations of values and action for ones own Self, not rules for someone else to follow. And I've understood quite a lot more about how your mind likely operates. And I know you value ""action"" as a viewable thing. So I want to let you know what I'm actually thinking, and what I will do in Sawyer, so there is no ambiguity or slack in the line to become a spiral.

I want to let you know I do not have the need to prove my worthiness to you, or to explain valid mistakes with offsetting good intentions any longer. I know what I was feeling. Or what I was thinking. Or intending when I did or did not do things. I have memory of things I did that were harmful, but also of things you twisted into one sided accounts and timelines that weren't true, or were distorted into horrendously caricatures and inappropriate emotional responses from you. This doesn't mean that you weren't hurt, or triggered, or harmed. You absolutely were. And I am sorry that any of my actions caused that upon you. The person I loved most. I fucked up both in times where I thought I was doing the right thing to help, and in times where I was simply scrambling, feeling I had to protect myself or others. I am willing to validate your feelings. I am not willing to validate non-objective recalls of actions or accusations of my internal thoughts brought onto me from an external perception that does not utilize constancy or grey tones.

I'm not doing this to attempt to get back with you. I'm not by that token, excluding any possibility of anything in reality, but I required a few specific asks when we were trying to work this thing out, and I felt those were wholly unheard. I do not intend for us to become physical, or intimate. I don't even have a real plan for what we both need to say. Maybe we just eat near each other and feel content to see our eyes lock up again and go on the roads to where we are headed. My hope is that, at the very least, we see each other for our real selves maybe one last time. Talk about our health and healing. Be utterly honest about where we were and where we are. For me so I do not have to remember you by the actions and face I saw in November that made me question the point of even going on. I told you way back last year I had certain ""conditions"" on this interaction if it were to happen.

**1. I fully accept the fact that you may not show up at all.**

You either may not want to see my face or hear my voice, or cannot. Maybe you have the girls. Maybe you have work now. Maybe you're at Love Burn. Maybe you are just with someone else and have been for a while like I thought you were. Maybe you want to be there but are absolutely frightened that it will dysregulate you or that I have some horrible plan to cause you emotional pain at hand. Your thoughts and reasons are your own to determine into action or inaction. I'm opening the portal as much I am willing, so I will be at the place from noon to one. I plan to be absolutely prompt about this, within reason. If I eat and drink alone. At one o clock, I will pay my bill, leave the place, get a coffee, then wrap up my time in Sawyer doing what I must to leave memories and items behind in a place where you can guess and may access for your own purpose, or to ignore and let decay.

In that situation, I will then regretfully do what I've never had the courage to do. Remove all channels of communication and consider my time knowing you on this Earth past. It will be thorough. I won't let you know where I'm going after my current situation ends this summer. You won't be able to find me, I believe. I abandon all hope and my only tie that bind to you will be my yearly promise to Charon Aurora of a July 12th meditation to envision who our child would grow into, would have sounded like, and what his Mother and Father would be doing in that life that I truly wanted with you.

**2. If you do come.**

My hope is, we do stay calm and show caring and compassion. We can talk about anything. There are no taboos. We can talk about what we've both been up to creatively. What's going on with our families. I'm dying to know what the girls have been doing. We can talk about how my job interview went. Or hardships and openness about the pain we've suffered in our time apart. We can find a private place to talk about very real ways that we both hurt each other. I have come to recognize many of my own mistakes and bad choices. I have a basket of accountability to give unto you. If we are being grounded during that, I may just ask you very direct and blunt questions. Not to dig, or store up ammo, but genuine things I wanted to know that help me process losing my fiancée, the girls, and our child. Losing the entire future I was so truly ready to become a better man for.

**But, because of what happened in September, if you begin to ask questions about what I did or now do with my time or body with other people, you will need to be forthcoming about your own activities first.** And I do mean an accounting for the last entire year and a half. I know you weren't honest with me in September. And not fully honest in April either for that matter. Your ideas about me were off base then, and I would guess off base now. But I will be as honest as you like in a real, healthy, and reciprocal exchange between us. If the focus begins to turn onto that, and I feel you are trying to downplay the existence of our poly dynamic, or impart another bad external character onto me, the conversation ends. I didn't get back what I gave to you then and I must set that boundary now. I said months ago, that if I will not accept a dysregulated interaction. From moment one to the end. If it devolves in any way from reciprocal conversation, and towards accusations where my memory, my thoughts, feelings, needs, or motivations are dictated to me, via your own projection or fear of vulnerability or accountability or rejection, I will pay my bill, and politely get up and leave. See last paragraph of 1 in that case.

***I believe we both can do this.***

And like I said in other letters that were not sent. What then? If we meet and eat and talk and it seems to provide something nourishing for us both, I have no plan for what then. Maybe we understand that it was a small few hours to forgive and mend, then leave the parking lot, temporarily drive in the same direction on the same highway, until we reach that fork between homes, and I drive straight, and watch you move gently right onto the big circled exit, and vanish away. Our physical forms never to be closer than they've been ever again as we live new lives and ""no matter what"" becomes just an expression of lost hope. Maybe that's what healthiest for the two of us. It's no longer my place to frantically claw and scrape to resist letting you go. I can tearfully accept this outcome. And go on living with a changed heart. I will stop leaving items in Box 276. I will heal. Maybe one day open up again truly to someone else. Likely not. I feel I reached the peak of what I could feel towards another person. I can't envision looking at another person the way I did you.

I..... haven't given up the bask of golden light we felt completely to be perhaps very vulnerably honest. Neither of us would be served by starting to push into cycles with that objective in mind. It's there though. I meant what I said when we thought this could be done with hard work. This isn't the time. I understand how you could perceive ""Possibly Maybes"" How action followed by words is sometimes more reassuring than lip service to impending action.

I need to see some things about ourselves.

And I really do just want to see you.

I need to see you. As you needed to see me in September. It would really do my mind, and my heart a world of good to see you laugh or smile at me again. I have nothing else behind that. I hope it would for you too.

***With love, that never changes. Maybe Nanu Nanu for the last...Maybe a few more.***

1ieyvv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/unsentLoveLetters1st/comments/1ieyvv3/meet_me_in_sawyer/,Meet Me in Sawyer,"Hi L.

I will be there.

I know we have been full and dead silent NC for almost 90 days now. Though it's not lost on me that you unblocked me on almost every avenue of communication around New Years. I know you feel fear. Please, if you can try to understand me, I have to hold my own boundary of not breaking that barrier of communication with you by yet again reacting to slivers of half-action on your part, and taking the whole responsibility to initiate a dialogue with you. You have an established pattern of blocking me, then admitting to me that you undo that and watch over what little I do show to the world on social media. I'm not angry or judging, or going to hold that over you. I'm pointing it out because it's my belief that you believe I truly did love you. You know I hurt constantly and miss you and ruminate and at some level, wish you would just stop the background noise and reach out on your own accord. And it's also my belief that you feel the same as I do, no matter how you tried to portray me or your experience, to rewrite your own character, or who you spend time with to push me way back in the mirror.

Truth be told, I have not stopped loving you and my memories of you. Even if I felt I had to take a forked path that led me away from you in June. I wasn't getting reciprocal collaboration from you when I was mulling over my own interests and that of my other loved ones that decision. The splits just got worse. This was always intended to be a momentary move, not a permanent one. Still is. I did recognize that we had reached a point where we were locked into patterns of both doing things and reacting to things in ways which we thought would protect us individually, but caused harm to the other as the consequence. I meant what I said that I had to choose my blood family for a while and try to get who I am back underneath me. **And that I meant I believed it would lead me back home to you. My Bb.**

That caused you to feel again that I was going to abandon you. And like many of the other instances where your perception of my actions and my own words to you was influenced by your own emotional response, I felt my true rationale and intentions in action were not only prohibited from existing in a fair light, but actually turned into perception of gaslighting and assault when I would stand up for and draw boundaries around what was true about me and my thoughts.

**I want to let you know that, after all the back and forth, and questioning of what purpose it can, or might serve, I will be honoring that plan to travel to Sawyer on Feb 14th.**

I made that intention almost a year ago amidst some of the worst of the cycles we traveled through. I believe shortly after the Crosses show. One of the many times I put your utmost happiness to mind and tried to be a good friend, lover, and fiancée to you. And one of the many times that, sadly, I think your fears of being abandoned really got the best of us, and my fears of not being a good healer got the best of me, and turned gold into lead. I'm not saying this to levy blame or impart shame. I just want to be grounded and rational about how we got to the this place....that feels like a grave yard for the deepest love I ever felt.

I made that date so long ago, and it's purpose molded and bended along with the increasing severity of these cycles. At first, I did it to show you my intent to be with you a year from then, and expressly said that I thought your DBT courses and existing therapy would have had time to start providing coping strategies for both of us that could lead us to active communication, building trust, and showing reciprocity in how we feel and express emotions and needs, and how we receive them from each other.

After Memorial Day. After Lakes. After Russian Circles. And after Godspeed, (what was, in my perspective, a purposeful, and intentional fabrication of reality in order to assign horrible intentions upon me as a cover for some deep regret or shame in you.) This purpose morphed. In July, I figured I would be halfway through the lease in the place I left to, and by then we'd be making a solid bridgework into recombining and me planning to move back near you. After trying to be with you slid into dangerous accusations and portrayals, this has turned into something that is likely a culmination of my own ultimate sadness. With the same uncertainty of your participation as I constantly felt in our relationship. If this trip is my own to take, and I find myself alone, this trip to Sawyer will be a place to lie at rest symbolic wreaths and artifacts to my hopes and dreams with you in a place that both represents happy memories of our early times together, but also became part of a phrase of hope and for pause during the turmoil.

Much like ""Midnight"" ""Meet Me in Sawyer"" meant to me that you wanted us to remember that we loved each other, and that we could converge on a spot that was halfway between us. An actual equal compromise so that we could mend our ailments together. I still honor those phrases in my own grieving of you and of H and J and Ghost. I've left beloved keepsakes from each of you in the place that was the eclipse. Was my childhood home, but now one that means one of my last moments with you. I don't even think I can return to it anymore.

It's entirely possible you will see me at the show tomorrow night. Or the one on the 11th. (Go to Box 276 if so tomorrow) Maybe it's crazy of me to think that you will be there. I won't lie and say I won't be scanning around for you. Expecting you to show up with a new person and possibly intention to harm with dysregulation again. But I need you to know, if you are there, it's my full intention that we do not converse. Having to walk away from you will kill me inside, but I HAVE to keep firm on my need and vow for myself that I will not allow another cycle to begin in an environment that I did not welcome.

**Yes, I will be going to Sawyer on Feb 14th.**

Noon. You know the restaurant. We got goodies and fruit next door before heading out to the park. We stayed nearby and fucked like idiots and lounged and bathed and mused at the silliness of this world while, only speaking to me, I began to fall madly in love with you.

**This is of utmost importance L. I want you to be in Sawyer.** If you do choose to come, I must state both my hopeful intentions, and my realistic expectations of why I'm opening this channel of communication for us. And I also need to set my own boundaries for it for both of our measures of healing. I've spent a lot of time while I've been alone thinking on how boundaries are a set of expectations of values and action for ones own Self, not rules for someone else to follow. And I've understood quite a lot more about how your mind likely operates. And I know you value ""action"" as a viewable thing. So I want to let you know what I'm actually thinking, and what I will do in Sawyer, so there is no ambiguity or slack in the line to become a spiral.

I want to let you know I do not have the need to prove my worthiness to you, or to explain valid mistakes with offsetting good intentions any longer. I know what I was feeling. Or what I was thinking. Or intending when I did or did not do things. I have memory of things I did that were harmful, but also of things you twisted into one sided accounts and timelines that weren't true, or were distorted into horrendously caricatures and inappropriate emotional responses from you. This doesn't mean that you weren't hurt, or triggered, or harmed. You absolutely were. And I am sorry that any of my actions caused that upon you. The person I loved most. I fucked up both in times where I thought I was doing the right thing to help, and in times where I was simply scrambling, feeling I had to protect myself or others. I am willing to validate your feelings. I am not willing to validate non-objective recalls of actions or accusations of my internal thoughts brought onto me from an external perception that does not utilize constancy or grey tones.

I'm not doing this to attempt to get back with you. I'm not by that token, excluding any possibility of anything in reality, but I required a few specific asks when we were trying to work this thing out, and I felt those were wholly unheard. I do not intend for us to become physical, or intimate. I don't even have a real plan for what we both need to say. Maybe we just eat near each other and feel content to see our eyes lock up again and go on the roads to where we are headed. My hope is that, at the very least, we see each other for our real selves maybe one last time. Talk about our health and healing. Be utterly honest about where we were and where we are. For me so I do not have to remember you by the actions and face I saw in November that made me question the point of even going on. I told you way back last year I had certain ""conditions"" on this interaction if it were to happen.

**1. I fully accept the fact that you may not show up at all.**

You either may not want to see my face or hear my voice, or cannot. Maybe you have the girls. Maybe you have work now. Maybe you're at Love Burn. Maybe you are just with someone else and have been for a while like I thought you were. Maybe you want to be there but are absolutely frightened that it will dysregulate you or that I have some horrible plan to cause you emotional pain at hand. Your thoughts and reasons are your own to determine into action or inaction. I'm opening the portal as much I am willing, so I will be at the place from noon to one. I plan to be absolutely prompt about this, within reason. If I eat and drink alone. At one o clock, I will pay my bill, leave the place, get a coffee, then wrap up my time in Sawyer doing what I must to leave memories and items behind in a place where you can guess and may access for your own purpose, or to ignore and let decay.

In that situation, I will then regretfully do what I've never had the courage to do. Remove all channels of communication and consider my time knowing you on this Earth past. It will be thorough. I won't let you know where I'm going after my current situation ends this summer. You won't be able to find me, I believe. I abandon all hope and my only tie that bind to you will be my yearly promise to Charon Aurora of a July 12th meditation to envision who our child would grow into, would have sounded like, and what his Mother and Father would be doing in that life that I truly wanted with you.

**2. If you do come.**

My hope is, we do stay calm and show caring and compassion. We can talk about anything. There are no taboos. We can talk about what we've both been up to creatively. What's going on with our families. I'm dying to know what the girls have been doing. We can talk about how my job interview went. Or hardships and openness about the pain we've suffered in our time apart. We can find a private place to talk about very real ways that we both hurt each other. I have come to recognize many of my own mistakes and bad choices. I have a basket of accountability to give unto you. If we are being grounded during that, I may just ask you very direct and blunt questions. Not to dig, or store up ammo, but genuine things I wanted to know that help me process losing my fiancée, the girls, and our child. Losing the entire future I was so truly ready to become a better man for.

We have decided to spend one day during the last couple days of our vacation in Paris. Want to do this on our own and not a guided tour. There are 3 places we hope to get to. The Louvre, Eiffel Tower and the Catacombs.

We will be taking Eurostar and planning to get there by mid to late morning. 

Louvre first, my 10 year old really wants to see the Mona Lisa, he saw the Sonic Movie 3 and is all excited to see that. I'm like..ok my little dude. Sure.
I plan on ~3 hours here. 

Next we will get transport or walk over to the Eiffel Tower, so  2-3 hours? And finally get transport to the catacombs.

Food wise my 10 year old REALLY wants a baguette, croissant for me. I saw plenty of pastisseries near the train station. I figure we couldn't go wrong with either of those.

But for lunch and dinner not looking for anything fancy. A bullion or brasserie would be perfect. My oldest also really wants to try excellent coffee.

Plan on taking the last train back to Paris around 9pm.

Maybe you want to be there but are absolutely frightened that it will dysregulate you or that I have some horrible plan to cause you emotional pain at hand. Your thoughts and reasons are your own to determine into action or inaction. I'm opening the portal as much I am willing, so I will be at the place from noon to one. I plan to be absolutely prompt about this, within reason. If I eat and drink alone. At one o clock, I will pay my bill, leave the place, get a coffee, then wrap up my time in Sawyer doing what I must to leave memories and items behind in a place where you can guess and may access for your own purpose, or to ignore and let decay.

In that situation, I will then regretfully do what I've never had the courage to do. Remove all channels of communication and consider my time knowing you on this Earth past. It will be thorough. I won't let you know where I'm going after my current situation ends this summer. You won't be able to find me, I believe. I abandon all hope and my only tie that bind to you will be my yearly promise to Charon Aurora of a July 12th meditation to envision who our child would grow into, would have sounded like, and what his Mother and Father would be doing in that life that I truly wanted with you.

**2. If you do come.**

My hope is, we do stay calm and show caring and compassion. We can talk about anything. There are no taboos. We can talk about what we've both been up to creatively. What's going on with our families. I'm dying to know what the girls have been doing. We can talk about how my job interview went. Or hardships and openness about the pain we've suffered in our time apart. We can find a private place to talk about very real ways that we both hurt each other. I have come to recognize many of my own mistakes and bad choices. I have a basket of accountability to give unto you. If we are being grounded during that, I may just ask you very direct and blunt questions. Not to dig, or store up ammo, but genuine things I wanted to know that help me process losing my fiancée, the girls, and our child. Losing the entire future I was so truly ready to become a better man for.

**But, because of what happened in September, if you begin to ask questions about what I did or now do with my time or body with other people, you will need to be forthcoming about your own activities first.** And I do mean an accounting for the last entire year and a half. I know you weren't honest with me in September. And not fully honest in April either for that matter. Your ideas about me were off base then, and I would guess off base now. But I will be as honest as you like in a real, healthy, and reciprocal exchange between us. If the focus begins to turn onto that, and I feel you are trying to downplay the existence of our poly dynamic, or impart another bad external character onto me, the conversation ends. I didn't get back what I gave to you then and I must set that boundary now. I said months ago, that if I will not accept a dysregulated interaction. From moment one to the end. If it devolves in any way from reciprocal conversation, and towards accusations where my memory, my thoughts, feelings, needs, or motivations are dictated to me, via your own projection or fear of vulnerability or accountability or rejection, I will pay my bill, and politely get up and leave. See last paragraph of 1 in that case.

***I believe we both can do this.***

And like I said in other letters that were not sent. What then? If we meet and eat and talk and it seems to provide something nourishing for us both, I have no plan for what then. Maybe we understand that it was a small few hours to forgive and mend, then leave the parking lot, temporarily drive in the same direction on the same highway, until we reach that fork between homes, and I drive straight, and watch you move gently right onto the big circled exit, and vanish away. Our physical forms never to be closer than they've been ever again as we live new lives and ""no matter what"" becomes just an expression of lost hope. Maybe that's what healthiest for the two of us. It's no longer my place to frantically claw and scrape to resist letting you go. I can tearfully accept this outcome. And go on living with a changed heart. I will stop leaving items in Box 276. I will heal. Maybe one day open up again truly to someone else. Likely not. I feel I reached the peak of what I could feel towards another person. I can't envision looking at another person the way I did you.

I..... haven't given up the bask of golden light we felt completely to be perhaps very vulnerably honest. Neither of us would be served by starting to push into cycles with that objective in mind. It's there though. I meant what I said when we thought this could be done with hard work. This isn't the time. I understand how you could perceive ""Possibly Maybes"" How action followed by words is sometimes more reassuring than lip service to impending action.

I need to see some things about ourselves.

And I really do just want to see you.

I need to see you. As you needed to see me in September. It would really do my mind, and my heart a world of good to see you laugh or smile at me again. I have nothing else behind that. I hope it would for you too.

***With love, that never changes. Maybe Nanu Nanu for the last...Maybe a few more.***

1ieytyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/LettersAnswered/comments/1ieytyv/meet_me_in_sawyer/,Meet Me in Sawyer,"Hi L.

I will be there.

I know we have been full and dead silent NC for almost 90 days now. Though it's not lost on me that you unblocked me on almost every avenue of communication around New Years. I know you feel fear. Please, if you can try to understand me, I have to hold my own boundary of not breaking that barrier of communication with you by yet again reacting to slivers of half-action on your part, and taking the whole responsibility to initiate a dialogue with you. You have an established pattern of blocking me, then admitting to me that you undo that and watch over what little I do show to the world on social media. I'm not angry or judging, or going to hold that over you. I'm pointing it out because it's my belief that you believe I truly did love you. You know I hurt constantly and miss you and ruminate and at some level, wish you would just stop the background noise and reach out on your own accord. And it's also my belief that you feel the same as I do, no matter how you tried to portray me or your experience, to rewrite your own character, or who you spend time with to push me way back in the mirror.

Truth be told, I have not stopped loving you and my memories of you. Even if I felt I had to take a forked path that led me away from you in June. I wasn't getting reciprocal collaboration from you when I was mulling over my own interests and that of my other loved ones that decision. The splits just got worse. This was always intended to be a momentary move, not a permanent one. Still is. I did recognize that we had reached a point where we were locked into patterns of both doing things and reacting to things in ways which we thought would protect us individually, but caused harm to the other as the consequence. I meant what I said that I had to choose my blood family for a while and try to get who I am back underneath me. **And that I meant I believed it would lead me back home to you. My Bb.**

That caused you to feel again that I was going to abandon you. And like many of the other instances where your perception of my actions and my own words to you was influenced by your own emotional response, I felt my true rationale and intentions in action were not only prohibited from existing in a fair light, but actually turned into perception of gaslighting and assault when I would stand up for and draw boundaries around what was true about me and my thoughts.

**I want to let you know that, after all the back and forth, and questioning of what purpose it can, or might serve, I will be honoring that plan to travel to Sawyer on Feb 14th.**

I made that intention almost a year ago amidst some of the worst of the cycles we traveled through. I believe shortly after the Crosses show. One of the many times I put your utmost happiness to mind and tried to be a good friend, lover, and fiancée to you. And one of the many times that, sadly, I think your fears of being abandoned really got the best of us, and my fears of not being a good healer got the best of me, and turned gold into lead. I'm not saying this to levy blame or impart shame. I just want to be grounded and rational about how we got to the this place....that feels like a grave yard for the deepest love I ever felt.

I made that date so long ago, and it's purpose molded and bended along with the increasing severity of these cycles. At first, I did it to show you my intent to be with you a year from then, and expressly said that I thought your DBT courses and existing therapy would have had time to start providing coping strategies for both of us that could lead us to active communication, building trust, and showing reciprocity in how we feel and express emotions and needs, and how we receive them from each other.

After Memorial Day. After Lakes. After Russian Circles. And after Godspeed, (what was, in my perspective, a purposeful, and intentional fabrication of reality in order to assign horrible intentions upon me as a cover for some deep regret or shame in you.) This purpose morphed. In July, I figured I would be halfway through the lease in the place I left to, and by then we'd be making a solid bridgework into recombining and me planning to move back near you. After trying to be with you slid into dangerous accusations and portrayals, this has turned into something that is likely a culmination of my own ultimate sadness. With the same uncertainty of your participation as I constantly felt in our relationship. If this trip is my own to take, and I find myself alone, this trip to Sawyer will be a place to lie at rest symbolic wreaths and artifacts to my hopes and dreams with you in a place that both represents happy memories of our early times together, but also became part of a phrase of hope and for pause during the turmoil.

Much like ""Midnight"" ""Meet Me in Sawyer"" meant to me that you wanted us to remember that we loved each other, and that we could converge on a spot that was halfway between us. An actual equal compromise so that we could mend our ailments together. I still honor those phrases in my own grieving of you and of H and J and Ghost. I've left beloved keepsakes from each of you in the place that was the eclipse. Was my childhood home, but now one that means one of my last moments with you. I don't even think I can return to it anymore.

It's entirely possible you will see me at the show tomorrow night. Or the one on the 11th. (Go to Box 276 if so tomorrow) Maybe it's crazy of me to think that you will be there. I won't lie and say I won't be scanning around for you. Expecting you to show up with a new person and possibly intention to harm with dysregulation again. But I need you to know, if you are there, it's my full intention that we do not converse. Having to walk away from you will kill me inside, but I HAVE to keep firm on my need and vow for myself that I will not allow another cycle to begin in an environment that I did not welcome.

**Yes, I will be going to Sawyer on Feb 14th.**

Noon. You know the restaurant. We got goodies and fruit next door before heading out to the park. We stayed nearby and fucked like idiots and lounged and bathed and mused at the silliness of this world while, only speaking to me, I began to fall madly in love with you.

**This is of utmost importance L. I want you to be in Sawyer.** If you do choose to come, I must state both my hopeful intentions, and my realistic expectations of why I'm opening this channel of communication for us. And I also need to set my own boundaries for it for both of our measures of healing. I've spent a lot of time while I've been alone thinking on how boundaries are a set of expectations of values and action for ones own Self, not rules for someone else to follow. And I've understood quite a lot more about how your mind likely operates. And I know you value ""action"" as a viewable thing. So I want to let you know what I'm actually thinking, and what I will do in Sawyer, so there is no ambiguity or slack in the line to become a spiral.

I want to let you know I do not have the need to prove my worthiness to you, or to explain valid mistakes with offsetting good intentions any longer. I know what I was feeling. Or what I was thinking. Or intending when I did or did not do things. I have memory of things I did that were harmful, but also of things you twisted into one sided accounts and timelines that weren't true, or were distorted into horrendously caricatures and inappropriate emotional responses from you. This doesn't mean that you weren't hurt, or triggered, or harmed. You absolutely were. And I am sorry that any of my actions caused that upon you. The person I loved most. I fucked up both in times where I thought I was doing the right thing to help, and in times where I was simply scrambling, feeling I had to protect myself or others. I am willing to validate your feelings. I am not willing to validate non-objective recalls of actions or accusations of my internal thoughts brought onto me from an external perception that does not utilize constancy or grey tones.

I'm not doing this to attempt to get back with you. I'm not by that token, excluding any possibility of anything in reality, but I required a few specific asks when we were trying to work this thing out, and I felt those were wholly unheard. I do not intend for us to become physical, or intimate. I don't even have a real plan for what we both need to say. Maybe we just eat near each other and feel content to see our eyes lock up again and go on the roads to where we are headed. My hope is that, at the very least, we see each other for our real selves maybe one last time. Talk about our health and healing. Be utterly honest about where we were and where we are. For me so I do not have to remember you by the actions and face I saw in November that made me question the point of even going on. I told you way back last year I had certain ""conditions"" on this interaction if it were to happen.

**1. I fully accept the fact that you may not show up at all.**

You either may not want to see my face or hear my voice, or cannot. Maybe you have the girls. Maybe you have work now. Maybe you're at Love Burn. Maybe you are just with someone else and have been for a while like I thought you were. Maybe you want to be there but are absolutely frightened that it will dysregulate you or that I have some horrible plan to cause you emotional pain at hand. Your thoughts and reasons are your own to determine into action or inaction. I'm opening the portal as much I am willing, so I will be at the place from noon to one.

1ieyt74,https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/1ieyt74/do_i_have_mice/,Do I have mice?,"Ok so, last winter a year ago I saw a mouse in my laundry room and absolutely freaked. After that I was finding my coffee eaten into and droppings near food on countertops, etc. I got the house inspected by a professional and they said they didn't see anywhere a mouse could come in. They said it might've just been one errant mouse looking to come in from the cold. I was still concerned so I bought humane traps with peanut butter and a granola bar in there and set them in the garage and in my house near where I saw the mouse. No luck. I sprayed mint spray repellent, put moth balls everywhere, and got those ultrasonic pest repellent things and idk what did it but I stopped seeing droppings and my food stopped being messed with so I figured it either died or got back out somehow.

I've also gotten a cat in the last 6 months.

Today, I needed a new dishwasher installed because the last one stopped working. When they pulled out my dishwasher, the insulation was covered in small brown dots and droppings and there was a hole in it. I also noticed that under my sink there was a hole a mouse could definitely fit through. My dishwasher and sink are both in my kitchen island, for context. The droppings and pee spots did look old but I'm no expert so I'm just thinking these are probably where the mouse went a year ago.

I put tape over the hole to see if it would be broken through, but as I was doing that I noticed that there were droppings on a mat under the sink I'd put down only a few months ago. Now I'm wondering if I still have mice? I haven't noticed any packages eaten through but I really hope they haven't been eating my cat's food which is left out for her to eat day and night.

What's my next move? How can I tell if there's rats living in my island? Every time I've put out food for them to eat they've never gone for it. I don't want to take away my cat's food because she likes to snack on it throughout the day. Is there another way to tell if there's still rats living in that island, and if there are what to do next.",1,1738385528.0,pestcontrol,1,1.0,False

A few days later she texted me to come over as her kid was at school and her husband was at work, she lived 6-7kms from my place so I went there. To my surprise she was wearing a black lacy lingerie, her boobs were just bouncing out, I got hard, she welcomed me inside and served me a couple of drinks, we then started to get closer and suddenly she kissed, at first I hesitated but later on I got intimidated and started to grab her ass and suck her lips harder.

I do not intend for us to become physical, or intimate. I don't even have a real plan for what we both need to say. Maybe we just eat near each other and feel content to see our eyes lock up again and go on the roads to where we are headed. My hope is that, at the very least, we see each other for our real selves maybe one last time. Talk about our health and healing. Be utterly honest about where we were and where we are. For me so I do not have to remember you by the actions and face I saw in November that made me question the point of even going on. I told you way back last year I had certain ""conditions"" on this interaction if it were to happen. 



**1. I fully accept the fact that you may not show up at all.** 

You either may not want to see my face or hear my voice, or cannot. Maybe you have the girls. Maybe you have work now. Maybe you're at Love Burn. Maybe you are just with someone else and have been for a while like I thought you were. Maybe you want to be there but are absolutely frightened that it will dysregulate you or that I have some horrible plan to cause you emotional pain at hand. Your thoughts and reasons are your own to determine into action or inaction. I'm opening the portal as much I am willing, so I will be at the place from noon to one. I plan to be absolutely prompt about this, within reason. If I eat and drink alone. At one o clock, I will pay my bill, leave the place, get a coffee, then wrap up my time in Sawyer doing what I must to leave memories and items behind in a place where you can guess and may access for your own purpose, or to ignore and let decay. 

In that situation, I will then regretfully do what I've never had the courage to do. Remove all channels of communication and consider my time knowing you on this Earth past. It will be thorough. I won't let you know where I'm going after my current situation ends this summer. You won't be able to find me, I believe. I abandon all hope and my only tie that bind to you will be my yearly promise to Charon Aurora of a July 12th meditation to envision who our child would grow into, would have sounded like, and what his Mother and Father would be doing in that life that I truly wanted with you. 



**2. If you do come.**  

My hope is, we do stay calm and show caring and compassion. We can talk about anything. There are no taboos. We can talk about what we've both been up to creatively. What's going on with our families. I'm dying to know what the girls have been doing. We can talk about how my job interview went. Or hardships and openness about the pain we've suffered in our time apart. We can find a private place to talk about very real ways that we both hurt each other. I have come to recognize many of my own mistakes and bad choices. I have a basket of accountability to give unto you. If we are being grounded during that, I may just ask you very direct and blunt questions. Not to dig, or store up ammo, but genuine things I wanted to know that help me process losing my fiancée, the girls, and our child. Losing the entire future I was so truly ready to become a better man for. 

**But, because of what happened in September, if you begin to ask questions about what I did or now do with my time or body with other people, you will need to be forthcoming about your own activities first.** And I do mean an accounting for the last entire year and a half. I know you weren't honest with me in September. And not fully honest in April either for that matter. Your ideas about me were off base then, and I would guess off base now. But I will be as honest as you like in a real, healthy, and reciprocal exchange between us. If the focus begins to turn onto that, and I feel you are trying to downplay the existence of our poly dynamic, or impart another bad external character onto me, the conversation ends. I didn't get back what I gave to you then and I must set that boundary now. I said months ago, that if I will not accept a dysregulated interaction. From moment one to the end. If it devolves in any way from reciprocal conversation, and towards accusations where my memory, my thoughts, feelings, needs, or motivations are dictated to me, via your own projection or fear of vulnerability or accountability or rejection, I will pay my bill, and politely get up and leave. See last paragraph of 1 in that case.



***I believe we both can do this.***



And like I said in other letters that were not sent. What then? If we meet and eat and talk and it seems to provide something nourishing for us both, I have no plan for what then. Maybe we understand that it was a small few hours to forgive and mend, then leave the parking lot, temporarily drive in the same direction on the same highway, until we reach that fork between homes, and I drive straight, and watch you move gently right onto the big circled exit, and vanish away. Our physical forms never to be closer than they've been ever again as we live new lives and ""no matter what"" becomes just an expression of lost hope. Maybe that's what healthiest for the two of us. It's no longer my place to frantically claw and scrape to resist letting you go. I can tearfully accept this outcome. And go on living with a changed heart. I will stop leaving items in Box 276. I will heal. Maybe one day open up again truly to someone else. Likely not. I feel I reached the peak of what I could feel towards another person. I can't envision looking at another person the way I did you. 



I..... haven't given up the bask of golden light we felt completely to be perhaps very vulnerably honest. Neither of us would be served by starting to push into cycles with that objective in mind. It's there though. I meant what I said when we thought this could be done with hard work. This isn't the time. I understand how you could perceive ""Possibly Maybes"" How action followed by words is sometimes more reassuring than lip service to impending action. 



I need to see some things about ourselves. 



And I really do just want to see you. 



I need to see you. As you needed to see me in September. It would really do my mind, and my heart a world of good to see you laugh or smile at me again. I have nothing else behind that. I hope it would for you too. 



***With love, that never changes. Maybe Nanu Nanu for the last...Maybe a few more.***

We're organizing another meetup for anyone interested in discussing philosophy and connecting with like-minded people in the city. Here's the plan:

🗓 **When:** Sunday, Feb 2 at 4 PM

📍 **Where:** Devoción (coffee shop), 69 Grand St in Williamsburg

For this session, we’ll be diving into Bertrand Russell's essay **In Praise of Idleness** ([read it here](https://files.libcom.org/files/Bertrand%20Russell%20-%20In%20Praise%20of%20Idleness.pdf)). In this paper, Russell argues that less work and more leisure time is beneficial for human well-being.

Feel free to join whether you’ve had time to read the article or not—there’s always room for thought-provoking discussion. If you’re interested, drop a comment or message u/Rare-Salt-7607 or me. Looking forward to meeting you all and hearing your insights!",2,1738385333.0,nycmeetups,2,1.0,False

>!When Frey ""returned"" to New York, which was unexpected, seems to be living a good life in a fancy and well-furnished $3-4k/month apartment, and everybody seems positive towards her. My first thought was this was an absolute cop-out of an ending, her poor upbringing and her adventures in a fantasy world was just all dream, then I quickly realize that something ain't right about this. Number one there was barely any car traffic in NYC, and that was before congestion pricing! But more seriously, this was just way too perfect.!<

>!I really didn't know where this story is going though, so Frey is in the coffee date with her ""mother"" which happen to look like Tanta Cinta, but when I heard Cuff as the waiter, I realized this was a legit mindfuck they are pulling on Frey. Just the urban NYC setting when she finally woke up with tilted buildings and otherworldly sky, just reminded me of those movies. I am genuinely surprised.!<

I honestly was super skeptical of this game, with all the middling reviews. As the game went on, its beginning to really grow on me. But after that sequence, this game just became a contender of one my favorites in recent memory. This is genuinely great game, fuck the haters, as Frey would say.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie for sh*ts and giggles. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.
I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but Ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-34 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

I think my work and social life has had problems from these misunderstandings. I’m not sure why I don’t know. Right now it might be that I do understand other similar phrases, or I might have been missing many of these.

1ieyliu,https://i.redd.it/nehmsfoeigge1.jpeg,February 2025 Mead Challenge!,"Hi all! We’re kicking off mead challenges this year - plan is to start quarterly, but that can change depending on interest and feedback. 

First mead will be a melomel with a secondary flavor addition. Guidelines below. 

ABV range - 10-14%

Sweetness - anywhere from dry to sweet is acceptable

Melomel - fruited mead. Whole fruit and juices are acceptable. 

Flavor additions - could be spices, herbs, citrus zest, vanilla, oak, tea, coffee, etc. Keeping this section open to interpretation! 

Reminder to use proper nutrition, and if using whole fruit keep the fruit cap wet/punched down daily for the first week. Typically aim for 4 weeks on whole fruit prior to racking or removing of fruit in mesh bag. Buckets are your friend with whole fruit. Pectic enzyme is recommended. 

Please refer to the Wiki for nutrition and general information!

Flavor additions can be added in primary or secondary. Secondary is often preferred to prevent flavor blowing off through fermentation and you can control the flavor more easily. 

Once started we ask to share your recipes used and will do a check in a few months down the road to see how everything is coming together. 

As an example I plan to do a red currant mead that is finished on oak.

I feel more torn down in the middle more than I have ever felt before in any other situations. Part of me wants to leave so badly, just get up and go. Find a nice apartment for myself somewhere where I can be alone on my own terms without being made to feel alone, where I can clean without having to argue with him to help me constantly, or feeling so overwhelmed with the constant clutter and lack of discipline. Somewhere where I can do my own wash without walking past bags and mounds of long forgotten and unsorted laundry strewn around. Somewhere where I can go a day without washing dishes because I have absolutely no help ever, and they don’t mind making the dishes but all the sudden it’s only my job to clean them. Somewhere where I can relax and draw without a child in my ear asking me what I am doing constantly or if they can watch, or if they can have a turn. Somewhere where I can sleep and get a full nights rest without being woken up to kids arguing or screaming at midnight, when they should be in bed and asleep themselves. Somewhere where I can feel at home and call home without being made to feel like I’m not wanted but only needed when it’s beneficial. If things were better aligned in my favor, and If I even had money saved, ideally, I would probably leave and get a place on my own. I gave up everything for him. For love. My job, my apartment, my home, my friendships. I stepped into the role of housewife and stepmom without being asked. Without so much as a thank you, and all I get is the opposite. I get taken advantage of, I get disrespected, I get screamed at, kicked, hit (by his kids), my makeup goes missing, my nail polish spread across a gifted coffee table. My acrylic paints bought for me by my grandma as a birthday gift still lay smeared along the wood. No “I’m so sorry she did that”, no “I’ll replace those for you” no “you’re losing privileges”, just a small smack on her tiny wrist and a “well that’s why you can’t leave stuff like that out”. I had placed my paints underneath the coffee table and tied the bag they were in in a tight knot. I should be able to leave my stuff (as long as it’s not dangerous), out without worrying whether or not it’s going to go missing or get destroyed. But somehow or another it’s my fault. “I’m jealous of a child” as he says. He doesn’t understand that I am not jealous of a child. I am growing resentful. Of him, his lack of respect and boundaries for my things that his children ruin or take, his obliviousness to the fact that I’m slowly becoming more and more miserable and unhappy, the fact that he lets her get away with so much constantly even if it involves me which is like a punch right in the stomach. I don’t know what happened. I don’t know where things went wrong. I can’t even sleep in my own bed in our room without both the kids being back there glued to the electronics like duct tape. He comes out to the living room with an annoyed look on his face and asks me why I’m so moody. He doesn’t understand that his lack of caring and respect is suffocating me from the inside out. He asks me if I want to come back to the room, and he’ll bring the kids out to the living room. What kind of question is that? Of course I want to sleep in my own room but I want him to want me too. I want him to move the kids to the living room/their bedroom without him asking me. I want him to want to make an effort in our connection and our relationship. But here I am typing this as I’m laying on the couch and he walked right by me without saying a word back to our room to sleep with the kids in our bed. He knew from the beginning of us talking that being with someone who already had kids was hard work. I knew that too. He acknowledged the fact that it was not ideal and if I didn’t want to be with him because of that he understood. At the time though, being with him meant dealing with kids, and I was okay with that. I knew what I was getting myself into, or I thought I did. I knew I loved him and I knew I had to choose his kids too. I did. I still do. Time and time again. They’re not my responsibility but he makes them mine. He’ll sleep the day away and leave me to feed the kids, keep them occupied, entertain them, get them drinks every 2 hours. I try waking him up, for my pleas and yells to fall on deaf ears as he rolls back over covering himself in a blanket. I know my anger comes out sometimes on the kids, but it’s not their fault. They’re victims of their dad too. I know he does loves his kids, and I admire him so much for that, but he also doesn’t respect them. He doesn’t respect the fact that he’s raising future adults and that they need routines and structure. They need fresh air, real food (not McDonald’s or Wendy’s), they need quality time and attention, they need to learn and grow without the use of electronics in their face constantly. Truthfully without me and his family, I don’t know what he would do. He wouldn’t be able to keep a job, keep up with the cleaning and the chores, manage to set aside time for his kids. It’s no use talking to him about these things because he gets so defensive. Maybe the reason he gets so defensive is because deep down he knows he’s not doing what he should be as a father. Just because you have the title of parent doesn’t make you a good one. No one is given a parenting manual, I get that. I don’t have kids of my own yet but it’s not rocket science. Even I know what he’s doing, or what he isn’t doing, isn’t healthy for them nor is it beneficial. I told him before I don’t know how long I can keep going like this. I don’t think he realizes that I’m serious every time I say that, but I also don’t know what to do or where to go. I have no money, no real money, this isn’t even my town. I love him but I’m too young to sacrifice myself, my dreams, my mental health on him and two kids that aren’t even mine. ",1,1738384299.0,AmIOverreacting,6,0.67,False

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

First and second photo is the first print. It works pretty good but I had spacing slightly off on the pins that lock into the racking tear drop slots. The third photo is now the 3 print in total that was spot on. So now I'm working on figuring out the right angle to have it hold my phone to not be too far out from the racking but I also don't want it to be vertical, as that would just be annoying.

30 degrees seems like a decent angle but I'll have to mess with one of my phone holders and see what angle seems right. Then it's on to finishing it off.

I'm so enjoying buying this printer. The Creality K1C has been so easy to work with so far and while I'm only beginning and learning a lot it's just fun! I should have bought one a long time ago. Though these newer model printers make this so damn easy... ",1,1738384158.0,3Dprinting,0,1.0,False

I moved into a small, quiet apartment, thinking new walls might block out the things I had seen. I got rid of all the electronics from my old place, smashing them as if their broken pieces could erase the memories. I swore off secondhand items entirely; I didn’t want to wonder who—or what—might have touched them before me. But no matter how many locks I turned or how far I tried to run, I couldn't escape the image burned into my brain: her pale face.

Her eyes were the worst, empty yet staring, pleading yet horrifying. And there was also the shadow, that grotesque figure tearing at reality like it was nothing but a thin layer of paper. Who was she? What was it? And who—or what—was watching her? The most terrifying question: why did they come after me?

These thoughts haunted me constantly. They seeped into my nights, eating away at my sanity until I paced through the narrow halls of my new apartment like some prisoner. Sleep wasn’t just rare—it was gone. Every sound, every flicker of light made my heart race. And then it happened: a buzz.

My phone, lying abandoned on the coffee table, lit up with a notification. An email. The sender’s name? Anonymous. The subject line? “Want to know the truth?

”Even as my instincts screamed at me not to, I opened it with shaking hands.

 The email was short—too short, like it had been written in a hurry:“

The lady you saw was Eleanor Baines. She needs help. Visit 112 Birchwood Lane. Don’t tell anyone. Watch your back.

”The name—Eleanor Baines—it felt real, something solid I could cling to. But it also felt... cursed. My stomach knotted tighter every time I reread it. Birchwood Lane. I knew of it—or its reputation, at least. It was at the forgotten edge of the city, surrounded by old factories and woods that no one went near willingly.

But now I had a name and a lead. It was more than I’d had in months. My fear clawed at my resolve, but desperation won.

I grabbed my coat, ignoring the small voice in my head whispering: Don’t go. Stay safe. Forget this. Instead, I stepped into the cold night, the dread clinging to me like an extra layer of skin. As the elevator groaned downward, I had this feeling deep down—I wasn’t just heading to Birchwood Lane. I was heading into something far, far worse.

I stood outside 112 Birchwood Lane, staring at a house that looked like it had forgotten how to live. It leaned slightly, tired and crumbling, with boarded-up windows that seemed to trap something awful inside. The porch sagged under its own weight, like it was ready to give up. The air around it was... strange. Heavy and damp, like the house was breathing unease into the night. 

At the rusted gate, my hand hovered over the latch. Something about the house pulled me in—not just curiosity but a darker, heavier pull, like I was prey walking into a trap. My legs ignored my fear and carried me forward.

When I reached the porch, the front door creaked open, slow and deliberate, as though it had been expecting me. The sound grated against my nerves, and I froze. Was it just the wind? Or something worse? The darkness beyond the doorway dared me to step inside, and I couldn’t stop myself.

The smell hit me the moment I crossed the threshold—rot, dampness, and decay. It clung to my throat, thick and sour. The walls, with their peeling, yellowed wallpaper, seemed to shift in the faint light, almost alive. Broken furniture was scattered everywhere, their jagged edges sticking out like teeth. The house groaned, its quiet movements making it feel... aware.

And then I saw it. 

In the middle of the living room, surrounded by debris and shadow, was a TV. An old, boxy set that should’ve been extinct by now. My stomach twisted as I stared. It was just like the one I’d destroyed, the one I had thrown out in desperation to forget. But here it was again, sitting in the ruins, its screen flickering. 

It was on.

Static hissed through the room, piercing and endless, sinking into my skull. My legs shook as I took a step closer, even though fear was screaming at me to stop. The flickering light from the screen painted the room in a sick, pale glow. Shapes seemed to move in the static—shadows struggling to break free. 

And then the screen cleared.

Her face appeared. Eleanor. The pale woman with the hollow eyes who had torn my life apart. Her lips quivered as though every word she spoke hurt. 

“Help me...” she whispered. Her voice was faint, but it cut through the noise, straight to my soul.

Before I could react, the static swallowed her words, leaving an echo that weighed down the room. My chest tightened as panic clawed at me. She was here—or part of her was. But how? And why? 

The shadows around me stretched, the static’s hiss growing louder, pressing against my ears. Every instinct told me to run, to leave and never come back. But I couldn’t. I needed to know. Who—or what—was she now? And what nightmare waited behind her desperate cry for help?

“Who are you?” I managed to choke out, my voice trembling as it cut through the static-filled air.

Her face—Eleanor’s face—shifted, flickering into focus with an unnatural sharpness. But something was wrong. Her features were warped, her hollow eyes glimmering faintly, almost as if they held a light of their own. Her lips quivered, caught between fear and desperation, and it became painfully clear: she wasn’t fully human anymore.

“My name is Eleanor Baines,” she began, her voice fragile, worn thin by years of torment. Her eyes locked onto mine, pleading. “I worked for them. For years, I helped them build the machines. I thought they were harmless. Just entertainment... just... TV.” Her words broke, as if splintered by regret. “I didn’t know.”

The static surged, a sudden wave of distortion that swallowed her voice for a moment.

“Didn’t know what?” I demanded, stepping closer to the flickering screen. Its sickly glow washed over her distorted image, and I could feel the weight of her truth hanging in the air.

Eleanor’s face twisted in anguish. “What they were really for... not until it was too late.”

“Who?” My throat was dry, my voice barely steady. “Who are you talking about?”

Her image flickered violently, the screen bending and warping as if the house itself were trying to silence her. But then she spoke, her voice a trembling thread against the storm of static.

“They call themselves The Watchers,” she said, her tone hollow with dread. “They use these TVs to trap people. To feed on them. On their fear. Their pain. Once they have you, there’s no escape.”

The air grew colder as her words settled in, and a chill spread through my chest. Her story felt like madness, but it was too vivid, too raw, to be anything but the truth.

“Why you?” I whispered, though my voice betrayed the storm raging inside me. “Why did they come for you?”

Her face crumpled, the kind of despair that shatters something inside a person. “Because I learned the truth,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “I tried to stop them. I thought I could fight them. But they’re too powerful.” Her form shimmered, her edges blurring. “They put me here. Made me... part of their game.”

The glow of the TV dimmed, the static growing louder and more violent. Eleanor’s face dissolved into shifting darkness. My stomach clenched as a new shape began to form on the screen—a mass of writhing shadow, formless yet unbearably present. It was the same thing I had seen in my apartment, and its presence was suffocating, dripping with malevolence.

“Don’t interfere, Ben,” it growled. Its voice was like a thousand shards of broken glass dragged across rusted metal. “This is your only warning.”

The sound vibrated through me, making my entire body tense with a primal terror I couldn’t suppress. Then, with a sickening blink, the screen went black.

The room plunged into silence, and for a moment, I could hear nothing but the frantic pounding of my heart. Whatever I had just witnessed, it wasn’t over. Not by a long shot.

The sudden darkness was suffocating, the weight of Eleanor’s words pressing against my chest like a vice. *The Watchers. Feeding on fear. No escape.* It sounded like the ramblings of a madwoman, but after seeing her face, hearing her voice, and witnessing the shadow’s threat, I couldn’t brush it aside as mere fantasy.

The air itself felt alive now—cold, sharp, brimming with tension. My ears strained to catch the faintest sound, but the silence was unyielding, oppressive. Then, a faint glow caught my attention. It spilled out from a doorway at the end of the hall, soft and otherworldly, almost beckoning.

Despite every instinct telling me to turn around, I moved toward it, each step hesitant. The door creaked as I pushed it open, revealing a narrow staircase descending into darkness. The glow emanated from below, its dim light casting long, ominous shadows on the walls.

A basement.

The wooden stairs groaned under my weight as I descended, the air thickening with every step. It smelled of metal and decay, a damp scent that clung to my throat.

When I reached the bottom, I froze. The space defied logic, stretching far beyond the dimensions of the house above. It was cavernous, the far corners swallowed by shadows. Along the walls stood countless televisions, their screens casting an eerie, flickering glow.

Each screen played a different nightmare.

On one, a woman pounded against the walls of a locked room, her screams tearing through the silence. On another, a man sprinted down an endless, shifting hallway, his face twisted with terror. A child trembled in a corner on yet another screen, their small frame wracked with sobs.

These weren’t mere images. They were people.

Real people.

The realization hit me like a punch to the gut. These weren’t stories or recordings. These were lives, stolen and displayed like some grotesque art exhibit. My stomach churned as I turned from screen to screen, the sheer scope of the horror sinking in.

Then I saw her.

Eleanor’s face flickered on one of the screens, her complexion pale and her expression hollow. She sat in a barren, windowless room, her hands gripping her head as though trying to block out the world. Her lips moved, and though her voice was faint, I heard it as if she were standing beside me.

“They’re watching,” she whispered, her words cutting through the static. “They’re always watching.”

My breath caught, my mind scrambling to make sense of it all. How could I help her? How could I stop this? My gaze darted around the room, desperate for answers.

And then I saw it.

At the far end of the basement stood a console—massive, metallic, and humming with energy. Buttons, switches, and dials covered its surface, and a single red light blinked rhythmically at its center. Above it, a plaque read:

**OBSERVATION UNIT: PROPERTY OF THE WATCHERS.**

I moved toward it cautiously, my heart pounding in my ears. The closer I got, the more the air seemed to vibrate, as if the room itself was reacting to my presence. The red light blinked faster now, almost as if it were alive, aware of me.

My fingers hovered over the controls. I didn’t know what to do, but I had to do *something.*

Before I could act, a sound ripped through the silence—a guttural growl so deep it seemed to vibrate in my bones.

I froze, every instinct screaming at me to run.

The shadows in the room began to move, twisting and writhing as though alive. Something was in here with me. Something I couldn’t see but could feel in every fiber of my being.

And it was coming for me.

The air in the basement got thick, suffocating me while the shadows seemed to twist and stretch in unnatural ways. The temperature fell, and with it, a dreadful feeling gnawed at the edges of my mind.

Then, from the darkness, it came—the shadowy figure. It didn’t walk—it slithered, its form twisting and reshaping like something alive, made of smoke and blackness.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” it snarled. Its voice was low and guttural, filled with a mix of malice and amusement that sent shivers down my spine.

I stumbled back, my heart hammering in my chest. My whole body screamed for me to run, to flee, but my feet wouldn’t move. My mind raced, desperate to find an answer, a way to make sense of this nightmare.

“What do you want from me?” I whispered, my voice shaky and weak, betraying the fear I couldn’t hide.

The entity’s form rippled, and its voice filled the room, vibrating through my bones like distant thunder. “We want what we’ve always wanted—fear. It feeds us, sustains us. You humans are full of it, so simple to manipulate.”

Fear. That’s all they wanted. And here I was, giving them exactly what they craved.

I took a step back, trying to calm my frantic thoughts. “You trapped Eleanor,” I said, my voice trembling but louder now. “Why her?”

A deep, throaty laugh echoed from within its shifting form, as if the question amused it. “She was curious,” it crooned. “Curiosity is dangerous, don’t you see? It drives people to look too deep, to ask the wrong questions. She tried to expose us, to strip us of our power. Now, she belongs to us—like so many before her.”

The truth hit me like a crashing wave. Eleanor had been a victim of her own curiosity, just like I was becoming. She had seen too much, and uncovered their secret. And they had twisted her, broken her—just as they intended to do to me.

Anger flared inside me, burning through the icy terror gripping my chest. My fists clenched, my body trembling—not with fear, but with a reckless kind of resolve.

“I won’t let you keep her,” I spat, my voice raw but determined.

The entity’s laughter grew louder, curling through the thick air like smoke. “You think you can stop us?” it mocked, its tone dripping with scorn. “You’re nothing, Ben. Just another source of fear. Another pawn in the game. Nothing more.”

I swallowed hard, my pulse pounding in my ears. Fear—they thrived on it. I was just another pawn in their game, just like Eleanor had been. But there was one thing they didn’t understand. I hadn’t come here to lose. I came for answers. And I would fight for them—no matter the cost.

“You’re wrong,” I said, my voice growing steadier with each word. “I’m not just fear. And I won’t be your pawn.”

The entity seemed to hesitate, like it was assessing me. Then, in a blur of movement, it lunged forward, its tendrils of shadow reaching out.

But I didn’t flinch. I couldn’t.

I stepped toward it, my mind sharp with purpose. The fear that had once threatened to consume me was fading, replaced by something far stronger—determination.

“I won’t let you win,” I whispered, my voice cold and firm. “Not her. Not anyone.”

The entity lunged at me, its swirling mass expanding into a vortex of darkness. It moved unnaturally fast, sending my heart into overdrive. The world seemed to twist around me as its tendrils reached out, ready to trap me.

Without thinking, I dodged. I stumbled toward the console, my hands trembling as I stared at the blinking lights and switches. I didn’t know what I was doing—I had no plan. But I couldn’t let this horror win.

Fear gripped me tightly, but something new began rising inside. The terror that had frozen me before started to fade, replaced by a strange, defiant courage. I had come for answers, and now, face-to-face with the entity, I knew one thing for sure: I wasn’t going to let it break me.

The entity’s form twisted, its tendrils snapping in frustration as it lurched toward me. But I didn’t back down.

I stood my ground.

And, summoning every ounce of courage I had, I stepped forward.

The entity hesitated. Its dark, imposing mass began to shrink, recoiling as if my presence alone was a threat. And then I saw it—just for a moment. It was afraid.

I could hardly believe it, but it was real.

Step by step, I moved toward it, each movement a challenge. My fear, the thing it had feasted on, was fading, and with it, its power.

And then, I heard her voice.

“Keep going!”

It was Eleanor. Her voice, soft but urgent, carried through the basement like a whisper in the wind. She had been trapped here, just like me, but now, her words were a lifeline pulling me back from the brink.

With newfound strength, I kept moving. One step, then another. My pace quickened, and the entity shrank further with every step I took.

As I moved closer, I felt something shift—an energy I couldn’t explain. My courage was draining the entity’s power, like I was siphoning its strength and transforming it into something stronger. I wasn’t just walking toward it; I was forcing it into defeat.

The room began to quake beneath my feet. The rows of silent TVs lining the walls crackled to life, their screens sparking and flashing wildly. The air filled with the sharp hiss of static, and then, one by one, the screens exploded.

The sharp pops of shattering glass echoed through the basement. Sparks hissed, and the entity screamed, its form unraveling with every explosion. The darkness around me thinned like smoke blown away by the wind.

On one of the flickering screens, Eleanor’s face appeared. Her expression was full of gratitude—and hope. She had been waiting for this, for someone to break the hold they had on her.

The TVs erupted in rapid succession, each explosion louder than the last. Glass and metal rained down, and with each blast, the entity grew weaker, its power unraveling until there was nothing left.

Finally, the last screen imploded in a cloud of sparks and smoke.

The room went silent. The tremors stopped. The basement, once suffocating and oppressive, was still now—eerily so.

I stood there in the aftermath, my chest heaving from fear and adrenaline. But the fear was gone.

I had faced it. And I had won.

I turned back to the screen where Eleanor’s face had been, expecting to see the haunting expression of a woman who had endured so much. But now, the air around me felt softer, lighter. Her face was still there, but it was no longer twisted with fear. It was calm, almost peaceful, her eyes free from the anguish they held when we first met.

She looked at me, her lips curving into a faint, grateful smile.

“Thank you,” she whispered, her voice light and gentle, like the wind brushing against your skin on a quiet morning. “You’ve freed me. Freed all of us.”

“I know you’ve carried this burden alone for so long,” she continued, her voice steady yet tender. “But there’s something more you need to know. Something that must be passed on.”

She reached out her hand, and a soft blue light flickered at her fingertips. In her palm, a small, old leather-bound book appeared—Eleanor’s diary. Its worn pages and faded leather told of years gone by, but it was a connection to the past, a keeper of secrets.

“This is my story,” she said, her voice now a whisper. “Everything he did... and everything I uncovered before it was too late. This diary holds the truth about the machines he built, how he enslaved spirits. It’s proof of his twisted plans—evidence you can use to stop him from ever hurting anyone again.”

A weight I hadn’t realized I was carrying suddenly lifted from my shoulders. The house, the darkness, and the fear—they all seemed to fade away. Her words, like a soothing balm, healed wounds I didn’t know I had.

And then, as swiftly as she had appeared, her face vanished from the screen. The screen went dark, and for the first time in what felt like forever, a quiet peace settled over me. It was the kind of peace that comes when you finally exhale after holding your breath for far too long.

That night, the house on Birchwood Lane burned to the ground.

I don’t know how it started. I didn’t hear sirens, didn’t see smoke rising against the sky. But I didn’t need to. I knew the truth. The house had served its purpose—its time was over. The Watchers no longer had a claim to it, no hold over it. Everything that had been trapped in that decaying, haunted place was finally free. The fire consumed it all, reducing the cursed house to ash.

The next day, I returned to my apartment, hoping to find some normalcy, some part of my life untouched by the darkness I had faced. I thought I could leave it all behind—the terror, the shadows, the fear. I tried to heal, to move forward, as anyone would.

But the quiet of my apartment wasn’t as comforting as it should have been. Some nights, as I lay in bed with the silence pressing in, I could swear I heard a faint whisper, carried on the wind. A voice so soft, so distant, it felt like a memory.

“Thank you, Ben. Thank you.”

It was Eleanor’s voice—a whisper of gratitude that had etched itself into my soul. Even as I tried to forget, to push it all away, I couldn’t shake the feeling that her words were still with me. A quiet reminder of everything I had faced and everything I had survived.

And though I never spoke of it, deep down, I knew one thing for certain: The Watchers were still out there. Waiting. Watching. Somewhere, in the shadows of the world, they were biding their time, waiting for the next soul to stumble into their grasp, the next fear to feed on.

But I wasn’t afraid anymore. I had seen them for what they truly were. And if they were watching me now, they’d see something different in my eyes.

I was no longer their prey.

I was their nightmare.

Yet, one question remained unanswered: Who was Eleanor?

Did full panel bloodwork as I've struggled with a myriad of mental health issues and wanted more insight. Have high cholesterol for my age and liver enzymes show some indication of fatty liver along with high blood glucose. I've since made significant changes to my diet which should be improving this.

Otherwise, showing that I have mostly heathy ranges on my bloodwork according to my doc. (Can I post blood work here?) Would post blood work if helpful.

Mentally my drive is medium/low without some form of stimulant. I drink 2-3 coffees per day. Libido is low. Energy levels feel sub optimal. I work in Sales and sit most of the day, also live in a place with limited sunlight exposure at the moment.

Here's what I'm doing to combat it right now:

* Lifting weights 3-6 times per week, high intensity
* 15 min of cardio \~3 times per week
* Sauna for 15-30 minutes, 3-5 times per week
* Sleep before 11, wake at 8:30 (3mg Liposomal melatonin + sleep mask)
* Eliminated refined sugars besides honey
* Eliminated dairy and grain products
* Eliminated 90% processed foods
* Rare use of boxers/briefs - mainly cotton when using
* Supplement list ncludes: Boron (3mg), Shilajit, Zinc (50mg), Beef Organ Supplement, Pine Pollen Tincture, butea superba (800mg powder, 33mg extract), Methylated B complex, Magnesium, Creatine, Probiotic, Prebiotic, Postbiotic.

Diet currently is pretty restrictive, as I'm working on an intense gut healing protocol. The daily diet looks like:

**Breakfast:** huge morning smoothie with mixed berries, avocado, spinach, broccoli sprouts, 10-20g Acacia fiber, 25G collagen, and more. Aiming for 50-60g protein with a variety of fruits/leafy greens.

**Lunch:** 250g Ground beef, sweet potato, olive oil, sauerkraut, lettuce

**Snack:** Sardines, Dates, dark chocolate, Raw honey

**Dinner:** Chicken/beef, sweet potato, mixed root veggies.

I add salt/mineral packs to my water and drink 4+ L per day

I am 100% sober.

Sleep studies show no disturbances or issues.

I've been following this routine for about a month and feeling definitely better, however I'm looking to absolutely maximize this and get my levels to like 700+ at least. I'm convinced this is a root problem of many of my issues mentally has to do with my test being low, or my test being low is hinting at a deeper root cause. I did blood work back at age 23-24 and had very similar numbers. For additional context, I smoked a shit load of weed from age 14-22 and figure that has crashed my test in development.

Would appreciate any and all insights and suggestions to get myself back on track. Any great supplements, protocols, practices, etc... I am wide open!

Thank you

i am frustrated with the younger people in our community, specifically bottoms, specifically the ones who seem to approach me in droves (was out the other night and this guy’s opening line was “you look like you’d choke me”) who do it with violence in mind. violence that they assume i will provide, when—while i could—i am not being open about that pursuit. like just sitting in a coffee shop or trying to have a drink and a ciggy at a bar. i know it’s just a result of unthinking racism mixed with sexual desire (this is a response i get exclusively from white queers), but still. 

it stings to be seen as nothing more than a vehicle for others sexual fantasies, especially because every single time i try to talk about this some pasty little fucker tries to educate me on “top privilege” or implies i am a “bottom-hater.” i am verse. i do bottom, occasionally. really, my issue is mixed between racial profiling and the pervasive belief among the kind of person who can’t tell you the difference between a sub and a bottom that someone who is in a sexually dominant position doesn’t need to consent. 

like jesus, what happened to “hey, how’s your night?” additionally, maybe i’m getting old (i’m 32 i’m not getting old but i am getting fucking TIRED), but it seems like the people i would be interested in are so desperate to get laid that there’s no game to it, no fun chase, no flirting or tension. it’s honestly really…fucking boring. anyway. can anyone else relate to this as a masculine trans person with a dominant lean? 

not looking to hear how much harder it is for other types of trans men, not looking to debate my experiences with white people who don’t understand the prevalence of racial bias in the trans community. thanks in advance!",16,1738383314.0,FTMOver30,4,0.95,False
