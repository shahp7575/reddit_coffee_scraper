I went to a coffee shop with her, went to the mall with her when I was worried about her and had a date, and just generally travel with her. However, she’s always in her travel cage which… She’s not very fond of. I take her out at destinations, of course. She was out at the coffee shop, the mall, etc. I obviously want to harness train her and take her outside. However, my fear is that if I do, hawks will come and steal her from me. So… my idea is to just walk around with an umbrella. I don’t really know if that would deter hawks, but I assume it would. Leela never really likes to leave my side either, so she’s not gonna be flying off away while walking (especially if I have a harness). Just wanted to know if this idea would work. Thanks!

Thanks for this group it made our planning easier!! 

We loved coffee at pearl street bagels- cowboy coffee and Persephone! 

We loved the taggert lake hike in the park- amazing. It is close to 4 miles but it is pretty easy for those in decent shape- not too much elevation. We snagged a spot at about 10am close to the trailhead . 

We got take out from Hand Fire Pizza the first day we got in- very yummy! We had lunch at Pink G’s - Mexican side and it was great! We also had dinner at snake river brewing - great food with a cool atmosphere . We also grabbed dinner at Aurora at the top of snow king mountain- this place is beautiful and the food and service are great!! 

Saturday we went to the rodeo and my kids were amazed! It was their first rodeo and they had a blast. We were able to walk from our place which was cool because parking seems busy. I bought our tickets 4 weeks in advance. I chose the no cover option and these worked great.

Before I dive in, I want to be open that Flexispot offered a $30 refund for posting an honest review on reddit. They were very clear they wanted it to be honest – the good and the bad.

So, I chose the E7 because I felt it was the best desk in my price range. But I also ended up choosing it because so many reviews talked about how great the customer service was and that it was incredibly easy to report any problems and that Flexispot was great at responding and resolving such problems (just go to their subreddit and they are very quick to respond to you). And to me, that was significant. If I was going to invest this much money into a desk, I wanted to know that if there were problems, I had an avenue to address them. 

So what do I think about the desk? Took me about 45-60 minutes to put it together by myself. I am not handy, but most everything was very simple and clear and had pre-drilled holes. The biggest issue I had was the cable management tray came damaged. I was still able to use it, but I let Flexispot know and sent pictures and they refunded $35, which I felt was very fair. And it was very simple to connect with Flexispot to resolve this issue.

While putting the desk together, it was very clear this is a very heavy-duty desk. Every part was HEAVY. I mean that in a very good way.  I went with the smallest desk they have, 48x24 and it is not easy to move on my own. When they tell you it will hold 365 pounds (I think that’s the amount on this one), they really mean it. I can sit on this desk and move it up and down no problem.

Speaking of moving the desk up and down, the speed is very good, the noise is very quiet, and I can do it with my mug of coffee on the desk with no fear of spilling. It’s very impressive. Not only that, but at a standing height, it is very sturdy with little to no movement unless you are trying to really shake it in a way you would never shake a desk. I can bump into and it doesn’t move. I can lean on it and feel like it supports me just fine. 

All in all, I am very happy with my purchase and would do it again. On top of that, if you go to the Flexispot subreddit and ask for a coupon code you can can get a coupon for an additional 15% off. 

Feel free to ask any questions and I will do what I can to answer them.",1,1750035122.0,StandingDesk,0,1.0,False

Over 10 years of marriage and like most with young kids, we don't have enough time together. I know this plays a part. 

I also know I am not perfect. I am always working on myself.. I go to therapy. I deal with adhd. (so does he but he isn't interested in exploring it or working on it). I am always honest. I tell him when I'm upset and why and as soon as he gets it or apologizes it's over. I don't hold a grudge.

But after all this time I'm still repeatedly asking him to see me. To listen to me.. And when I actually say like - Babe I'm talking and you just started scrolling you're phone, looking at the mail, walking out of the room.. - he replies Oh here we go... 

Now (not prior to marriage) we completely disagree on politics. It's a hot button issue and we can't discuss it. We can't discuss it bc I had to draw a boundary bc when we have discussed it he gets loud and aggressive and over talks me bc his goal is getting me to AGREE with him. And he gets angry when I don't bc he's always convinced he's right. I won't play bc no matter what, according to him - my sources are wrong, I believe propaganda, I don't know what's REALLY going etc. So boundary was drawn bc nothing good comes from this. And I WILL protect my peace. 

He rarely opens doors or makes me feel protected in ways I am used to or ways I thought were the norm - see me carrying a heavy bag, help. See me waking out to car in morning with coffee, w bags and a dog - please open my car door or ask if I need help. 

Emotional connection is very hard for him IMO. I just don't feel it.. If I am stressed or going through something it just stresses him out and he seems to only look at it from his pov. There is ZERO empathy. 

I do 98% of parenting.. Physical, emotional and strategic. It's always been me... I'm a really good mother. I'm everthing I didn't have as a child.

He had a very rough childhood. He is braking cycles and I give him so much credit for that. We tried marriage therapy and after a few sessions the therapist said he had to get individual therapy first. He does that now. I wish I saw more changes.. I started therapy years ago due to marriage stress.


I don't want to traumatize my kids. I don't want to ruin their family. I am a huge believer in family and family values. I don't WANT to fund up. But I've hit a wall. I'm tired. I don't know how much more I can do. I know my worth. And I'm done letting my life and mood be dictated by his frustration and fears.  Can I just quiet quit, protect my peace and whatever will be will be?

One is a coffee date at a place that I've been wanting to try for a long time. I estimate I'll spend less than $30 all together including transportation.

The second is dinner, I deliberately picked a dive bar that has a cheap but solid menu. Again, I may spend $30-40 including transportation. 

The third date I'm trying to schedule, he's suggesting a restaurant that's quite out of the way for me to get to (he has a car, I don't). Entrees are between $30-50 and I will likely have to Uber home because I'm not taking an hour long (two) bus ride after 10pm. I'm estimating this will be about $70 😬
I could afford it, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget, while also spending my money on things that bring me the most joy. Dinner at an expensive chain an hour away from my house is not it.

How much do you usually budget for a first date? How much do you push back if the suggested option is less than ideal?

I would now like to buy another filter focused grinder for a different location. I could buy another Ode gen 2, but I'm wondering if the grinders that he expected to come out actually did come out and if so, what they are.

I've looked pretty carefully but haven't seen anything that clearly seems to fit the bill: electric, clarity focused filter grinders in a similar price range to the Ode but that might outperform it.

I’ll briefly introduce them in order of the pic then:

💚(Age at present: 8) Leonardo, aka Leo, a cheery and energetic kiddo who loves rubber duckies, he’s has quite a liking of rubber duckies or even real ducks. He’s the kid with no trauma, yayyy- but well, he watches brainrot. Trivia: >!He has a ducky collection like Lucifer from Hazbin Hotel, you might see him come out yelling “Aha, my Most Valuable Collection…A Golden Ducky!!! That Shoots FIRE!!!”!<

❤️M001, aka Terrance, a robot who can be quite agressive sometime as he’s created to be a war machine afterall, he’s physically strong and athletic, yet can be quite goofy and humorous most of the time. Fighting with him is not recommended, especially when he’s coded to be protecting his siblings. He loves gaming with his cousins, yet is always trolled by 💚, ending up losing. And rmb…neither let him drive nor sing!!! Trivia: >!He’s my first oc created, as well is my little brother’s main!<

🩷(Age at present: 12) Liana, aka Lili, a joyful and cheery kiddo with a serious obsession of carrots, she’s a talented fella mastering ballet and violin…even though this can’t save her from being chubby. She’s my main oc and my main. Her compassion is quite a weakness to her during some situations, and is quite an emotional fella. She’s mostly attached to her big sis 💜 (will introduce later), and cares at a lot about people around her, can be quite clingy as well as huggable. She can make a great friend to speak to, and a shoulder to lie on. But, never steal her carrots in front of her, she’s chubby, yet can be really fast. Trivia: >!She has a carrot collection, similar to Leo’s, but might decrease due to a little appetite of hers, she always carries a giant carrot around…!<

💜(Age at present: 16) Diana, or Na for short, cold outside yet warm and soft inside, she won’t easily show her soft side to others, she doesn’t trust boys much, except to her brothers, she has hidden quite a lot of secrets and insecurities, and often overthinks and worries with doubts, causing insomnia, that’s why she has quite an addiction to coffee, especially espresso, she loves bitter stuff. She’s quite an overprotective sister with slight favouritism towards 🩷. Can be arrogant sometimes, but she knows the limits and manners. And also, don’t ever let her go in a kitchen, or else it’s either gonna end up with an explosion or a nice dish…similar to Raiden Shotgun’s. Trivia: >!Every person who tried her dish is mostly gonna come out lying, ready to be sent to the hospitals, you’ll be very lucky if you puked it out, probably will have the worst experience on your tastebuds and you’ll be food poisoned!<

💙(Age at present: 16) Artemus, Arty or Mussy(That’s what Lili calls him) for short, intelligent, but is the only introvert in the group, he has really low self-esteem, and constantly hides his right eye (he has heterochromia, which he was always bullied due to it), he easily gets sick during rides, and can be quite calm in most situations, he sometimes might do something that no one knows why, overall is a tall softie, big brain and the parents in the group. He seems to be more comfortable with 🩷💜 most of the time. Trivia: >!He’s the first one to be sent to the hospitals after trying Diana’s very first dish!<

So earlier I made pumpkin spice latte soap, using cold brewed coffee as a water replacement.  So far I have only used water, various teas, coffee, and coconut water as a replacement, with no issues.  My next soap was to be caramel apple latte soap.  I'm using coffee butter and will include grounds, so that takes care of the latte part.  I wanted to add apple in some way, so I thought why not apple juice?  Should have double checked before I started, but I was very eager.  I weighed my lye and juice in separate containers.  I slowly poured the lye into the juice, and at first it looked fine.  But when I turned my attention away to prep the oils, I the mixture erupted all over my counter.  Oof.  So I sopped it up with paper towels and neutralized it.  Then I looked up what could have caused the reaction--it was the sugars in the juice.  Ugh.  I feel really stupid.  I don't know if I want to try again.  I have two options, dilute the juice or freeze it.  I'm afraid either way might not work.  Any other ideas to get apple into the soap?  I also put pumpkin puree in the PSL soap, which I have done before with no issues.  Applesauce?  I don't know if that will go rancid.  The big lesson today was always double check your recipe before soaping!

1lcfeo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lcfeo2/aitah_for_not_believing_her/,AITAH for not believing her?,"1 (32m) wife (28F) We’ve been married for 5 years know each other for 5 , one daughter three years. Full time nanny.
I thought We had a good life we bought a house 2 new cars . We both have professional and very thriving career. 18 months ago she switched jobs. She went to a much bigger company with higher salary and  position. Six months into her new job she start med coming later every day having more meeting and late deadlines . I asked  what is with all this late meetings? I was told well it’s a new job. I need to prove myself. I have to work late. I have to meet the numbers and I didn’t think much of it then because I know her career is demanding and she does  need to work hard.
Moving forward, those late meetings now becoming a normal she started going out of town and out of state for conventions and seminars which she claims it will improve her position  and her skill for higher management  positions.
Eight months after she started the new job, The nanny had a vacation planned which we approved six months ago she needed to go out of the country for two weeks. We both agreed that I will cover one week and she’ll cover the other week. A let her choose the which week she would like to cover. I covered my week first and three more days of her week because I was not busy so she only had to cover four days. She called me up. She said something came up. She had training that she forgot all about it and she will not be able to cover and take care of the baby. She asked me to do that for her.
I flipped  I yelled at her I called her every name in the book . I accuse her of  cheating , being a bad mother and soul. She hung up the phone on me. She turned off her location and she turned off the phone and for three days she disappeared.
On Sunday night, she showed up all pissed off refusing to talk to me refusing to answer any questions and we continued for two more weeks with this toxic intense atmosphere.
After that, she called me up. She said I need you to come home. We have to talk. She sat me down and she said I don’t want be married to you anymore. We need to get separated and get a divorce. I can’t live like this. This relationship is toxic. We cannot be together , this not a good match.
I was shocked. I said whatever the problems are we  could work it out. It’s not a big deal. It doesn’t warrant destroying the family. She said I will not change my mind. I’m done. I don’t love you anymore. I don’t want be with you , honestly the last one ( I don’t want to be with you anymore) made me cry. Her Family tried to to talk to her,  family did also She was imminent about the separation and the divorce. 
She said you either move out or I’ll move out but the baby will stay at the house. I said ok  fine. I will move out to my bother place  She stayed in the house with the baby and the nanny . 
A month after this she called me up. She said we have to sell the house and we have to divide our finances i said isn’t premature. Can we work on this? She said absolutely not. You have to come and we need to put the house for sale right now.
Moving forward, the house was sold we divided the money and we agreed in the principle that we don’t need a lawyers because  we both make about the same amount of money and there is not going to be an alimony or a child support. We keep one car and each keep their own 401(k). And we both will have our daughter 3 days , 4 days and we alternate weekends. 
Right after the house was sold she told me she’s moving to an apartment nearby the daycare center . We do the exchange at the daycare.She did not give me the address and I didn’t care . 
A week or two later I was told by my sister-in law with whom I am staying that my wife moved in with someone from her work .
I lost it. I called her up and I told her we both agreed that we’re not going to introduce our daughter to any potential partner unless we both agreed.
The Audacity of this woman she said our daughter knows him for a long time. He’s not a stranger. I said so you have been cheating on me all this time. She said it is what it is. 
After I discussed the situation with my parents and siblings, I filed for a divorce a week later.
I called her up and I told her I filed and she should be served soon and I need her to sign the agreement and proceed with the divorce. She said she’s fine with it and she will do that.
three weeks went by. I haven’t heard from her. I called her up and I said have you looked at have you signed the papers? She said she will but she’s going to hire a lawyer. I said why do we need a lawyer? I thought we have an agreement we don’t need to waste money on lawyers. She said she’s not paying for her for the lawyer. Her company provide the legal services. 

I said yes but then I have to hire a lawyer. She said do what you have to do. Therefore, this evil person had me to go and hire a lawyer. And everybody knows lawyers are not cheap and they really do not look to resolve the issues. I think they complicated more. After two weeks of playing phone tag these two lawyers they got together and agreed that my lawyer will draft the agreement. We sent agreement to her lawyer and we waited three more weeks. We haven’t heard from them. My lawyer reached out to her lawyer. He told him they need to revise the agreement and he will be sending his comment soon.

of course, two more weeks before  we received the revised agreement in which now she’s asking for child support . I don’t get it. I’m making $225k , she makes $210, in which universe I have to pay $1500 in child support. 

 I refuse to sign and I tried to reason with her , she refused .  after more than six weeks of being pressured by my family just to move the process forward. I agreed to an $800 a month.
Things stabilized for two months of course my family is pushing me to move forward with my life. They even tried to set me up with some blind dates. I told them I’m not ready.
6 weeks went by after I agreed to her demands, we still don’t have a signed agreement. My lawyer tried many times to reach her lawyer with no success. Finally her lawyer said he has no issues with the agreement but, she not signing it and he doesn’t even sure she will. My lawyer told not to talk to her about and let him resolve the problem with her lawyer. 
About two months later  , I was waiting at the daycare to do the switch. I had my daughter with me and she was supposed to pick her up. She called me up. She said she’s going to be an hour late. I wasn’t happy but I had no other choice. I waited Two hours later she showed up. Looks like she’s been crying. She’s not all together . I asked her if she’s OK to drive I really didn’t care about her. I just worried about if it’s safe for my daughter to be in a car. She said she’ll be OK and she just had an argument with her living in boyfriend And she’s not sure what she’s going to do. I didn’t ask any more questions Honestly, I didn’t give a fuck.


A week later, I got a call from my sister-in-law where I’m staying. She asked me if she could see me somewhere to have coffee and not to tell her husband I said what is this all about she said I will let you know. Can we do that ? I was reluctant, but I agreed. 
We met she told me she just saw my wife and she asked her to reach out to me and see if we could patch things up. She would like to come back and rekindle the relationship for the sake of her daughter and she’s sorry about what she has done and knows now That it was a mistake and it was a horrible mistake and she doesn’t know how to fix it, and if I could find it in my heart to forgive her, and she wants to move back to , my sister-in-law said she seems very remorseful and she has not stopped crying during their meeting. She didn’t tell her what went wrong with the boyfriend, but she kept saying it was a mistake. It was a horrible mistake. I was an idiot. I was blinded. I should have never done what I have done.

I knew now  why she doesn’t want to tell her husband because all of my siblings and my parents will be against me going back to her.
When I told my parents the story, I really thought my mom would have a heart attack. My father stood up and he said if you go back to this woman, I will disown you for the rest of my life, and he left the house.

now I’m confused I really would like to have my daughter have a home where there is a father and mother also i’m not sure if I should trust her
Can you please advise


To clarify,
The divorce was based on irreconcilable differences not infidelity .

1lcfdlr,https://i.redd.it/s3nj1kduo67f1.jpeg,Technical Issues,"Hello! Has anyone else been experiencing technical issues with their Yahoo email? Ever since the app was updated, I’ve had several issues. A few months ago, someone emailed me an attachment, but it did not show up in my email. I tried expanding the email, opening the email on my phone, opening the email on my laptop, and refreshing the email, but the attached document did not show up. I forwarded that email to my Outlook email, and the attachment was visible. 

Another issue was that someone sent me an email, but I did not receive it. They insisted that they sent it to me, and they even forwarded the sent email to me, which shows that it was sent from their end. I looked in my spam, but it wasn’t there. I carefully reviewed our thread, but I could not find the email, even though it shows that it was sent on their end. I contacted Yahoo, but they didn’t think anything was really wrong because this was a one-time glitch, and they reluctantly let me speak to a supervisor, who forwarded it to their technical team. 

Additionally, after the app update, I’ve noticed that more of my emails (about half) are consistently being marked as “junk” even though they are from legitimate senders. Even emails I send to other people are being marked as “junk.” It’s disappointing that without the paid version, you don’t have much access to the customer service help line, and you are only able to block 3 accounts. And lately, I’ve been receiving numerous spam emails that don’t go away after unsubscribing.

Father’s Day used to mean something simpler—calls, cards, maybe a memory shared over coffee or a walk. But for those of us who’ve lost someone we love to QAnon, especially a father or grandfather, or for those of us being kept at a distance by someone we love, the day can bring up a storm of feelings.

I wrote a heartfelt note to my son today. I didn’t hear back. I believe he’s struggling—his world, as an only child, once centered on just his mom and dad. And now it’s fractured. I still hope. I still reach. But it hurts.

That said, I’ve been thinking a lot about who we were before the conspiracy theories, before the paranoia and mistrust. And I want to invite others here to do the same.

If you’re up for it, maybe reflect on:
	•	A favorite memory with your dad or grandfather before the shift happened.
	•	Something they taught you just by the way they lived—work ethic, kindness, humor, discipline.
	•	A phrase or habit you picked up from them that still shows up in your life.
	•	A moment when you felt seen or protected by them.
	•	What you would thank them for if you could go back in time, before the beliefs took hold.

We are allowed to hold the whole story: the love and the loss, the confusion and the clarity, the man he was and the one he became.

For anyone dealing with estrangement or silence today, know you’re not alone. And if it helps to write it down, share it here, or keep it private—that’s all valid.

Sending support to all who carry this invisible grief.

This time I hit 4 spots in San Telmo, and 2 bonus places on a very long walk north. All of these recommendations were sourced from locals at Mundo Linguo or from comments on my previous post. Thanks again for the tips!

# Conclusions:

* Medialunas are better than croissants.
* 3 medialunas are not too many medialunas, but 6 are definitely too many medialunas unless you have a friend. Unfortunately, my friend is on keto so he was useless.
* I posted pictures of my last crawl on my work Slack, but I work with a bunch of professional bakers who were super upset that I didn't post cross-sections of the medialunas, so this post has cross sections. I will now be able to tell my coworkers that cross-sections do not change the flavor of the medialunas.

And onto the medialunas!

**PUNTO Cafe**

* $3300
* Medialuna was a little dry. A little too close to a croissant. Not bad, but with a stack of 4 medialunas, this is the one we didn’t finish.
* Great coffee, also a great Caesar salad, too!

**Atalaya**

* $1200
* Recommended by tons of people (and also one person over and over and over), this medialuna has a soft, bouncy, traditional interior resembling brioche. Slightly crunchy top. This was absolutely the best medialuna out of these 4. This is the one I went back for the next day! Really good.
* Mediocre coffee

**WAT**

* $3200
* Most buttery, open structure. Good honey flavor. This is more like a croissant, but not too much. Best flavor out of these four.
* Best coffee, really cool atmosphere inside the cafe. Dark and moody. Great cafe for a second date. This is probably where I would hang out if I lived in San Telmo. Thank you to the recommendation from @[DonovanKnife](https://www.reddit.com/user/DonovanKnife/)!

**Pertutti**

* $900
* Soft texture. This tasted a little more like a pillsbury biscuit in a croissant shape. Totally worth $900 though.

# Round 2 - Bonus!

We finished our first medialunas and headed north. I was already full by this point and started hallucinating medialunas jumping out from behind corners. But it was worth the walk for one of these two!

**Confitería Ideal**

* $2000
* Not worth it. This was like a croissant, but not a great croissant. It also may have had some kind of orange flavor painted onto the top?
* This was a massive, beautiful space on a touristy strip. Definitely felt like a tourist trap. It also had a bunch of croissants and other pastries that are currently all the rage in France/Italy like the striped pistachio cornetto and the cylinder croissant. If you're going to go to a goofy touristy cafe, order a goofy touristy food.

**La Nueva San Agustín**

* $950
* A commenter (@[acanis73](https://www.reddit.com/user/acanis73/)) on the last post mentioned that San Agustín had won awards multiple times in a row, and it did live up to the hype. Soft, bouncy texture. Good butter flavor. I probably ate it longer after it was baked than some of the other options so the texture wasn’t quite as ideal, but I can understand why this one has won awards. This was one of my favorite Medialunas in Buenos Aires.
* I would love to go back to this cafe to try some of their other items! They had some really beautiful looking meat pies and other pastries. Next visit.

1lcf8b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowShouldIProceed/comments/1lcf8b9/ill_start/,I’ll start,"I’m not sure if I’m looking for advice or just need to vent, but I could use some feedback because I’m feeling pretty lost.

Brief background: she and I were acquaintances for years, but got closer after my divorce in early 2024. We work together in similar roles, so we have to collaborate regularly. About nine months ago, things almost started romantically, but she said she wasn’t ready. Around the new year, things picked up—we dated, talked daily, traveled, said “I love you,” and it felt real and mutual. She opened the door to exclusivity despite saying she wanted to go slow. I tried to be there for her, especially knowing she’s had a pretty rough past.

She almost ended it once, saying she felt suffocated and citing her trauma. I took that seriously and adjusted, and for a while, things felt grounded again for both of us.

Then a couple months ago, she had a serious health issue, and I was there through it. Soon after, she told me she didn’t want a relationship at all. It hit me hard. I couldn’t stop ruminating, and while some of our later interactions were friendly or even flirty, they were confusing and reopened the pain.

Fast forward, she has a critical health event a couple months ago and it made her re-evaluate everything. Understandably. I was there with her in the hospital the whole time. Two weeks later she tells me she doesn’t want a relationship, period. Devastating.

So for a month+ I’ve just been spinning. Can’t stop thinking about her, checking socials, ruminating, what went wrong/what could I have, wondering if she’s seeing someone else. I’m starting to come out of it, but you know the drill.

This whole time, I was getting two senses from her: that she was closed off and moved on, and that she may still think about me and consider a future there. We had some interactions. Mostly surface level, but some genuine conversation and what seemed like flirtatiousness. I was confused and felt like I was getting mixed signals. Mostly, it kept re-opening that pain. Having to see her all the time at work was bad enough, but this added layer was frustrating.

Finally, I asked her for coffee. I wasn’t even really sure what I expected out of the conversation. Reconciliation, to draw a boundary about these conversations we’d been having, idk. I just wanted to talk with her, I guess.

She said no, and added that it was upsetting and confusing that I would even be asking her at all. She then blocked me on IG/fb.

I realize that asking might’ve crossed a boundary, and I was acting from a place of hurt and confusion.

I know I have some responsibility here, and maybe she does too. It just sucks. Part of me feels some relief now that the door is fully closed, but part of me still aches. I know the feelings will fade, but I don’t know how to handle seeing her at work or how to navigate that relationship professionally going forward.",3,1750033311.0,HowShouldIProceed,2,1.0,False

1lcf60f,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Financial-Photo2890/comments/1lcf60f/gear_up_once_cry_never/,"Gear up once, cry never","Grab these **essentials up front** so you’re not hunting for tape at midnight:

* Double-wall dish barrels (the thick ones—plan on eight to ten for a typical family kitchen).
* Medium cartons (book and pantry heroes) and large cartons (linens and plastic toys). Aim for 40-45 total.
* Six to eight wardrobe boxes with the metal hanging bars. They keep dress shirts crisp and double as pop-up closets on day one in the new place.
* A mountain of clean packing paper—about forty pounds for a big kitchen. Skip newspaper; ink transfers.
* Heavy-duty tape, three-mil thickness or more (buy eight to ten rolls).
* Two rolls of stretch-wrap plus a dozen moving blankets for furniture, mirrors, and TVs.
* Color-coded markers or labels—one colour per room. Future-you will weep with gratitude.

**Pro tip:** order 10 % more of everything. Running out of paper at 11 p.m. is how heirloom plates meet their doom.

# 2. Kitchen first, because breakables take time

1. Cross two sheets of paper into an X, center a plate, fold corners over, repeat. Stack four or five plates, then wrap the stack like a burrito.
2. Load those bundles **on edge, not flat**—they’re stronger upright.
3. Glasses: stuff a half-sheet inside each rim, wrap twice, and drop them rim-down into cell dividers. Stemware gets its own dish barrel.

# 3. Closets and dressers

* Hanging clothes go straight into wardrobe boxes; never exceed eighteen inches of hanger space or the bar bends.
* Everything foldable can stay in drawers. Stretch-wrap the entire dresser so drawers don’t slide during loading. Saves cartons and ironing.

# 4. Furniture, art, and electronics

* If a TV’s original box vanished years ago, blanket-wrap it and stand it upright against the truck wall—screens never ride flat.
* Artwork and mirrors slide into picture cartons lined with a blanket. Mark the glass side with “FRAGILE—THIS SIDE OUT.”
* Remove shelves from bookcases and tape them together; it prevents mid-move rattling and lost pegs.

# 5. Garage realities

* Drain fuel from mowers and gas trimmers—movers can’t haul flammables.
* Box tools in small cartons; a pile of wrenches hits seventy pounds fast.

# 6. Label like your future self depends on it

Write the room name in **huge letters** on two adjacent sides and the top. Underneath, add a quick cue—“Kitchen: baking gear” or “Bedroom: winter sweaters.” When exhaustion sets in at the new place, you’ll know exactly which box to open first.

# 7. Load-out sequencing for sanity

1. Bulky but sturdy items (sofas, bookcases, mattresses) form the base wall in the truck.
2. Medium-weight cartons fill gaps.
3. High-value breakables and “open-first” essentials ride last so they come off first—think coffee maker, router, basic tool kit, kids’ night-time gear.

# 8. Forward-thinking extras

* Snap phone pics of your TV and Wi-Fi cable setups before unplugging. Reassembly will take minutes, not hours.
* Use a free QR-inventory app like Sortly. Scan a box and know exactly what’s inside without slicing tape.
* Schedule a charity pickup forty-eight hours before move day. Lighter truck, smaller bill, instant karma.

“How do you manifest bigger things?”

But when you really dive into it, you’ll realize — there’s no such thing as “bigger” or “smaller” in manifestation.
Your subconscious mind doesn’t categorize things that way. To it, manifesting a cup of coffee is the same as manifesting a million dollars, a house, or your dream partner.

If you can imagine it, you can have it.
Actually — you already have it. It exists in another version of reality, and all you need to do is align yourself with it.

You create your own limitations.
So know this: There is no limit but YOU.
Once you embrace your power, you’ll realize that nothing is truly hard to manifest.

Whether it’s a specific relationship, a huge amount of money, a dream house, or even world peace — it’s all the same.

These are the foods (and stack) that actually helped,"If you’re constantly drained — not burnout-level, just “why am I still tired?” — food matters more than most think. But not in the “eat more bananas” way. It’s about how your cells *make* energy. Mitochondria, NAD+, ATP — all that behind-the-scenes stuff.

Here’s what worked for me:

* **Eggs, salmon, spinach, and sweet potatoes**: These hit most of the key cofactors — B vitamins, iron, magnesium, and clean carbs for sustained energy. Not trendy, just real.
* **Dark chocolate (high % cacao)**: Boosts nitric oxide and mitochondrial efficiency. Small daily dose = steady afternoon focus.
* **OMRE NMN + Resveratrol**: This was the turning point. NMN boosts NAD+ (your cells’ energy currency), and resveratrol supports the longevity genes (sirtuins) that manage how your mitochondria function. I started feeling more “on” — mentally and physically — after about 10 days. No stim spike, just higher baseline energy.

Food lays the foundation, but if your cellular engine is sputtering, you’ll need more than smoothies and coffee. Mitochondria need raw materials *and* the spark. Get both right, and the difference is pretty obvious.",1,1750032816.0,LongevityStacks,0,1.0,False

Most of the mainstream advice skips the part where real energy = cellular energy = mitochondrial function. That’s where things like NAD+, B vitamins, and iron status come into play.

Here’s what actually made a difference for me (and what I’d recommend anyone start with before chasing sketchy nootropics):

* **NMN + Resveratrol**: This is the core. NMN fuels NAD+, which your mitochondria need to generate ATP (aka energy). Resveratrol helps activate sirtuins, which keep those pathways running clean. I use OMRE’s version — the form actually stays stable and doesn’t oxidize in the bottle. Not all NMN is created equal.
* **B12 (methylated)**: Essential for energy metabolism and nervous system health. If you’re vegetarian or low stomach acid, this one’s key. Avoid cyanocobalamin, go for methylcobalamin or adenosyl.
* **Iron (only if deficient)**: Low ferritin = chronic fatigue, especially in women. Always test first — too much iron isn’t better.
* **Magnesium (glycinate or malate)**: Improves sleep, calms the nervous system, helps with muscle recovery. Most people are low.
* **CoQ10 (ubiquinol)**: Supports mitochondrial energy production. Can be huge if you’re on statins or over 35.

If you feel like your “get up and go” is stuck in second gear, don’t just reach for another coffee. Support your mitochondria. Stack wisely. This stuff actually moves the needle.",1,1750032758.0,LongevityStacks,0,1.0,False

Shattered some accountant’s coffee cup with a bullet earlier, found them hiding under a desk, begging.

*No mercy for fascists.*

I grabbed his necktie and *pulled* as hard as I could. As his face and lips went blue, I smiled and said,

“What’s the matter? Collar a little too tight?”

*Sometimes I kill myself!*

As the supersissy slumped over, my comrade the Jacket motioned for me to come this way, and I *danced* over to him theatrically.

“Alright, Commander, I’ll send 4^(th) Squad to check it out. Probably just some private taking a smoke break again.”

I nodded and went back to filing paperwork.

All of a sudden, my radio starts squawking amidst the muffled sound of shouts and gunfire.

“Contact! Conta-UGH!”

*What?!*

I scrambled to access cameras, but they were all down.

*FUCK!*

Pressing the silent alarm, I grabbed my service rifle and tried to open the door and see for myself, but it was jammed shut.

“Sargeant Nicholson, come in Sargeant Nicholson! What the fuck is going on down there?!”

There was silence for a moment.

Then over the comms, came an eerie, wheezing cackle.

“Guess who? HAHAHAHAHA!”

*The Clown…*

This damned old breed had been a thorn in our sides for *far* too long.

“Class Clown, I would presume.”

“And...who else?”

*Huh?*

“Hi!”

*Aw fuck it’s the Jacket.The Jacket and the Clown are working together. Why me?*

“Betcha never thought us old breeds could resist you fascist fucks, huh?”

I sighed in frustration.

“I don’t know what your plan is, Clown, but you’ll never-”

“HAHAHAHAHAHAHAheeheeheeheeheehee(COUGH COUGH)...Do I *look* like a guy with a plan? I’m just in this because I *hate* fascists. I hate authoritarians. Hate ‘em. Hahaha...You and the rest of your...*Ubermenschen* and your cannibal lizard allies!”

The Clown’s voice sank into a hissing register like he didn’t have enough lung capacity to express his hate but had to keep talking.

”*The UN has become the very thing it was founded to destroy!* And no matter where you *run*, be it to Argentina or Leirn, *justice will find you.*”

“And what exactly have we done that would warrant such a response?”

The Jacket piped up.

“You’re letting the Feds win for starters.”

*Um...what?*

“You’re...gonna have to explain that one to me.”

“The Federation wanted to wipe humanity out, yes? That was their goal. By turning vast swaths of mankind into these...twisted, predatory parodies of ourselves, leaving an ever dwindling population of real humans, you are risking the end of the human race. Which is exactly what the Feds wanted, isn’t it?”

“Are you implying new breeds aren’t human? Didn’t take you for a racist,” I snarked as I waited for the silent alarm to bring help.

“Nope! New breeds are an entirely different species, under the scientific definition of a species...Hell, you can get offspring from a tiger and a lion. Sterile offspring mind you, but...did you know that new breeds and old breeds are genetically incompatible? And they just *can’t* have any kids together? So no, we ain’t the same species.”

*That is...somewhat disturbing.*

“And how does it fall to you to-”

I am interrupted by the Clown laughing again.

“Heh, *fall* to us...You know, we made the news on Venlil Prime not long ago. Remember Administrator Cromwell?”

*They did that? Admin Cromwell was found dead at the base of a bridge with a Glasgow Grin carved into his face!*

“You see, Cromwell had been rather nasty to the Venlil in his allotted area. Took whatever he pleased...Including, \*heheheh...’\*Getting Welsh’ with the locals, under coercion.”

*Ah.*

“That is...well, actually that’s disgusting. But why did you kill him?!”

“EEEheeheheheheheheheeehheheehahaha! You see, justice is like gravity. *Sometimes all it takes is a little push.*""

“...You’re insane.”

“Indeedy-do! Now… We still need you alive for this next bit.”

I raised my gun to the door.

*Ugh, my head…*

I could vaguely hear talking, but then one of the two voices broke into an eerie *cackle…*

My eyes shot open, I *know that laugh*.

I wasn’t in my room, now I was in the commons.

*Oh God...I remember now…*

The Clown and the Jacket had knocked me out and tied me up.

They might have stripped me of my weapons, but I still had my claws!

As I squirmed around to try and cut through my bindings, the Jacket turned to me.

“No can do, crackerjack! Them bindings are made of slashproof nylon!”

To my confusion, the Clown pulled out some kind of rusty remote that looked like it came straight out of the Cold War, with some clearly jury-rigged additional buttons.

“Ehehe...Let’s not...blow...things out of proportion here, Commander Ballmer!...Y’know, with your last name you should be selling PCs or something, not sending APCs or whatever the fuck it is you do.”

As the Jacket laughed, I glowered.

“Why should I be afraid of *either* of you, or of that little piece of scrap?”

“It’s not what I’m *holding* that you should worry about, it’s what’s on the other end of this here dead man’s switch.”

*Dead man’s switch?*

A sinking feeling entered my gut, and not a pleasant sinking feeling like that Thafki I’d had the other day.

“You see the thing about apocalypses is...they leave a lot up for grabs. And if you try and fuck with us...well...\*Heheheheheeheeheehee...\*We’ve got an ancient *nuke* I found in a moldering bunker *somewhere* near one of your bases.”

I gasped in shock.

*Oh fuck…*

“But which one? And where? And what planet? Well...""

SLAM!

The door came crashing down and UN reinforcements barreled through it.

“HOLD YOUR FIRE! He’s got a dead man’s switch!,” I yelled out.

The sargeant in charge of the relief force, a Sgt. Mansley, repeated my orders, before yelling out,

“What are your demands, Jacket?”

The Jacket just laughed and said,

“For the UN to not let the Feds win...and for Commander Vore over here to stop eating Thafki.”

I looked around and some of the soldiers looked genuinely *angry* at me.

“What? I was just trying to improve mankind’s station by-”

“By cozying up to cannibal Nazis, yeah, yeah,” the Jacket cut in. “Hey, Clowny, where’s our ride?”

“Should be here any minu-”

CRASH!

BRATATATATATATATATATATATATATATAT!

The unholy vehicular offspring of a Gothic cathedral, a tank, and Cruella Deville’s car *burst* through the wall, machine guns blazing and scything down UN troops like wheat in an old breed’s field. Return fire didn’t seem to do anything other than scratch the paint.

Out of the vehicle clambered…

*A Venlil? No...there’s something different about this one…*

It was then I realized: her eyes glowed like that of a New Breed.

“RAAAH!”

*SCHING!*

***SCHLURK!***

As a soldier bayonet-charged the trio (a rather poor idea), the She-Venlil pulled a sword out of *nowhere* and cut off their head.

“What *are* you?”

She smirked.

“Nothing that concerns you. Come on, boys! Let’s scram!”

The Clown and the Jacket clambered into the...vehicle, the clown *singing* as he did so.

“[Strange Love, Strange Love, I’ve got a Strange Love for that bomb! Diggadiggadiggadiggadoo!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3gJ2XUZQ4o)”

As the vehicle pulled out, the Jacket threw something small, which landed by my feet.

It was a grenade.

Will write more. It’s in the nosleep format. My main concern is things not being totally clear. Enjoy!

I’ve just finished my third winter making snow. It’s a strange job so it only makes sense I’ve experienced some strange things while doing it and I’ve decided to catalog some of the odd experiences I’ve had so far. 

If you don’t know what snowmaking is I basically am part of a team that makes man made snow for a ski hill so they can extent their winter seasons and have better snow conditions. I work on this small hill deep in the Canadian Rockies that’s also the oldest still operating in the region, there’s a small town about a 10 minute drive away but sometimes at night that road extents longer for no apparent reason but I’ll tell that story another time. I moved out here for the winter after failing to get rehired as a lifty at my old ski hill and desperate to stay in the industry I decided apply to this snowmaking position as I don’t mind being wet and cold and I wouldn’t have to deal with customers. I got hired and training started around the beginning of October. That’s where I first learned of the challenges this job has that few others do. 

Training was held in a bay of the mechanics shop. They had set up fold out plastic chairs and tables that looked like a typical classroom. All two dozen or so of us snowmakers arrived as a group as we all shared accommodations and had left our new home as a group. We were preceded by our superiors who told everyone to take a seat as we walked in. They started training my introducing themselves, they all have real names but honestly everyone only ever refers to them by their nicknames that are so ubiquitously used that I’ve even heard the hills owners call them by their nicknames in a professional meeting. They’ve all acquired these names from something that happened at the hill, all stories I might tell at some point. There is the manager Jonah, the kinda guy who looks like he could be anywhere between the age of 35 and 55 with greying curly hair and sunken features. He wore a flannel shirt and jeans with a blue Chevrolet ball cap and safety glasses which he would never be seen without, he is average in height and slightly overweight with a goatee that doesn’t match his face shape. Then there was the 4 foremen, Foxbody who is a tall skinny guy in his late 20’s with a head of brown buzzed hair a mustache and a tanned leathery complexion. Carrie is the only female foreman. She was on the shorter side but you could tell was relatively brawny even with a baggy hoodie on, she had long black silky hair in a ponytail coming out the back of her plain black trucker cap. Sonny, he had a stocky frame and was about 6 feet tall with unkept long blonde hair mostly hidden by the hood from his worn out brown Carhartt hoodie. Gremlin, is a smaller Australian guy only a little taller than Carrie but far less brawny and with wiry red hair and a long mustache in the same colour that almost fully covered his mouth, his neck and arms were covered in tattoos of snakes and roses. 

After introductions Jonah explained our responsibilities, it is a long boring lecture that I’ve sat through three times now and all the returners usually fall asleep listening to but the gist of it was that we would work 2pm-2am or 2am-2pm because we needed to run the snowmaking guns 24/7 and night is the best time as well because that’s when the temperature is coldest. The snowguns work by firing high pressure water and high pressure air at the same time to break apart water droplets coming out so they freeze at a much faster rate. We would need to go out and adjust the air and water ratios, the different settings to do this are called banks. We would do this h ased on the wet bulb temperature and in general just keep the guns running as effectively as possible to make as much snow as possible. 

My back was aching by the end of it from sitting in those uncomfortable chairs for so long but unfortunately we weren’t done yet because the foremen started handing papers to everyone. “This here is a list of safety precautions that are specific to this department that they didn’t outline in your online on-boarding course, we’ll go over it now and if anyone has questions about it I’ll answer those at the end.” Jonah said. After he read out the list there was a litany of questions, most of which were answer by the foremen and Jonah with phrases like “that’s not important for your position” or “we are not certain of the answer to that ourselves but if we figure it out we’ll get back to you” around 10 people quit and left for their homes or other jobs because of this list which Sonny later told me drunkenly at the bar wasn’t unusual and happens every year. Heck, some days I wonder why I didn’t join them. I’ve decided to directly put this list on here, hopefully this won’t get me in trouble but we are working on updating this list for this upcoming season so I should be in clear as it isn’t technically company documents anymore. I also put extra context in parentheses as there is a lot of industry jargon in this list

Safety Precautions and Tips for Snowmakers

1. Ensure you dress properly for the weather as we work in extreme weather conditions
2. We work on snow and ice so be cautious of slips trips and falls
3. Be cautious when driving snowmobiles and follow all rules in the upcoming snowmobile operators course
4. Do not approach or feed any animals you see. Instead report it to dispatch if they are bigger than a porcupine
5. Do not go onto any runs with a winch cat (a big industrial snowplow with a winch on it so they can operate on steep runs without flipping over) operating on the run as the cable has enough force to seriously injure or even kill you
6. If foreign substances ie. rust, mud, sticks, rocks, animal parts come out of an air or water hydrant allow it to flush out before connecting a hose as it could clog the filters on the guns or burst the hose open (Guns are connected via hoses to hydrants which themselves are connected to a hill wide water and air pump system)
7. If you hear animal noises that don’t sound quite right, especially at night, just ignore them and do not report them to dispatch as the noises themselves are inconsequential
8. If you go on to a run where there are no currently operating snow guns report it to dispatch before proceeding
9. If dispatch asks you what run you are on do not respond, that is not actually dispatch and they already know where you should be anyways
10. If a snowboarder wearing all pink is riding on an unopened run, do not stop them simply let them proceed
11. If you are in a hut for break (we take breaks in whatever building is nearest to the run we are working on) do not leave open food containers in there when you leave the hut as mice or something else could take it. 
12. Watch for cracks in whales (piles of snow make by our snowguns) as they could split and you’ll fall in. Be careful no matter the size of the whale, the splits can go deeper than seems logical
13. If you return to where you left your snowmobile and it has disappeared, follow its tracks, they usually don’t take them farther than a few hundred feet. Remember to radio dispatch if you need to travel onto a run without any snowguns to retrieve it. 
14. If you see a headlamp in the darkness that does not belong to you and your partner nod twice with your own headlamp. If it doesn’t not nod twice back report it to dispatch and calmly head back to whatever building you are using to take your break in.
15. Only report eyes in the treeline to dispatch if there are greater than 10 pairs
16. Leave hoses to freeze after shutting off a gun (I later learned this is industry standard, then again not much of this is)
17. Before moving a frozen hose inspect it for any sections unfrozen and melts snow sprinkled on top of it, if you find a section that meets these qualities squeeze it to feel for something that will have a feeling similar to squeezing raw chicken. Should you find a hose like this bring it to the dumpster at the base straight away and get a new hose from dispatch
18. If you are on a run where snowcats are not scheduled to be and you see a snowcat driving along your run stop what you are doing and quickly make your way into the treeline, try to hide yourself and put your head down because you don’t want to see what’s in the snowcat. If you are in the alpine and above where the trees grow and there is no where else to hide just go into the fetal position and put your face into the ground.
19. If the same person comes up to you from the same direction more than once to ask you the same question don’t question them and reply as you did the first time no matter how many times this happens
20. Take note of how you left each gun, if something has changed on it since the last time you were at it calmly leave the area and go to dispatch where they will call your foreman on the phone
21. If you notice anything or anyone else odd or unexplainable that poses or posed an immediate threat to you or your partner radio your foreman with the code 10-66. If it did not pose a threat to you or your partner report it to your foreman at the end of shift meeting. 

Reading that back I don’t know why I didn’t decide to quit right then and there but I guess I’d figured people had done this for several years and I was no stranger to dangerous jobs, I had spent the last summer working on a cattle farm and had a few close calls with both animals and machinery, and snowmaking is by default a very dangerous job. For example we were told earlier during the training session that in the last 20 years only one snowmaking crew in the region has gone without needing to make an insurance claim for a workers injury. But I remember to this day the first time I felt the kind of danger unique to this job. 

It was a clear night and the moon was full which was nice for us because it meant my surroundings weren’t a murky blackness outside the light of my headlamp but instead a vague image of the trees and mountains beyond. My partner for the shift was a tall German guy named Deitrich, he was taking a gap year fresh out of school, he was naive to world but always excited to participate in it. We were both equipped with our high-vis winter coats, helmets, headlamps and shovels. As it was the early season the ski runs were nothing more than grassy clearings with disappointing piles of snow dotted along its path. As we showed up to what was probably the 15th gun on this run that was placed on a flat spot at the base of a steep section that towered like a wall over us. We were around midway up the mountain so pine trees towered over us on either side of the run. In distance we were able to make out part of the valley and mountains on the other side but because we were off to the side of the mountain we couldn’t see the light of the base area nor town. Occasionally if we were far enough away from the deafening noise of the snowguns we could hear the rumble of the trains that frequently roll through the valley, sound really carries out here. Dietrich walked over to the where the snow from the snowgun was falling to check the quality of the snow and I went to the gun to check for any ice build up and be ready for it we needed to change banks. After using my shovel to knock ice off the frame of the gun I looked down the slope to check on Dietrich and he nodded his head twice. Even though it was relatively bright night it’s still difficult to make out a persons body with their bright headlamp facing you so head movement is the only way we can communicate non verbally. I assumed his nodding meant the snow quality was good so I started to walk over to him. When I’d closed about half the distance he nodded again but it didn’t seem to be at me so I looked over my shoulder at what his light was facing and that’s when when I saw a headlamp up on the ridge. 

It was maybe 100 feet from us. I turned back and hustled over to Dietrich. When I got there I asked him “Hey, were you nodding at that light up there?” 
Dietrich responded “Yeah, they’ve not nodded back. That’s no good right, now we do what?” 
“Oh shit, we need to get need to get out of here and get back to the shack”
I barely got done exclaiming that sentence when we both dropped our shovels and turned to bolt down the hill. The shack which was for one of the ski lifts was where we were taking our breaks as well as the nearest building. It was a blur the whole way down except for when I turned around and the light was chasing after us and seemed to have gained 25 feet on us. I could see the light was about 8 feet off the ground but because of the same issue with us not being able to see each other through the beams of our headlamps I could not make out the figure the mysterious light belonged to. We kept running at full speed, I was in tunnel vision the whole time. My legs started to get tired but the adrenaline wouldn’t let me slow down because I knew if I did I would not be able to get back up to speed. I was sweating like a dog under all my gear but that was the last thing I cared about at that point. Dietrich had beat me to the shack, his tall stature and lean frame made him a lot faster than me. He just about took out the door when he slammed into it trying to get it open. He held the door open for me and I nearly wiped out trying to stop on the concrete floor inside the building. 

Dietrich slammed and locked the door as I slid a chair over to him that he jammed the door with. I threw myself down onto the floor in the corner of the shack between the wall and the metal cabinet of fuses, gauges and controls for the ski lift. And Dietrich did the same on the other side of the cabinet. My eyes darted around the room for something I could use to defend myself with. The only thing I could come up with was the thermos of coffee in my backpack, I felt so vulnerable. Now I was wishing we hadn’t dropped our shovels when we took off running. The lift operators tools were just as out of reach, sitting outside where I could see the light was just arriving up to the shack. It wasn’t bobbing up and down the way a headlamp does when someone is walking, instead it moved smoothly like it was floating. The light had seemed to get brighter, lighting up the shack like it was noon. I still couldn’t make out the figure that possessed the light though. It came up to the door and I braced for something to happen, I wanted to look away but I couldn’t peel my eyes from the light even though I had to squint to look at it. The attack I was expecting never came, it just began to circle the shack. It did about a half a dozen laps around the building and then it stopped behind the shack which was the only side with no windows. That’s when the light suddenly went out like someone flipped a switch and turned it off. I leaned around the corner of the control box to look at Dietrich. “You think it’s gone now?” I whispered
“I think so. Should we radio Sonny?” Dietrich replied, his voice shaky. I nodded to him and pulled my radio out its holster on my coat “Colt to 42.” 42 was Sonny’s radio number, all the foremen had them. 
“Go ahead” Sonny responded
“We just had a 10-66” I was trying and failing to sound calm about it because everyone working on the mountain used the same radio channel. 
“10-4, what’s your 20?” His tone had changed from his usual casual speech to a tone that told me that even he was concerned.
“Bottom of Spruce Chair”
“10-4, I’m on my way, you two hang in there” 

Sonny approached the shack on the side by side with caution, scanning the area. We moved the chair and unlocked the door to let him in. Once he was inside he took off helmet and said “So, you guys okay? What happened?” I told him we weren’t hurt but pretty shaken and described to him how Dietrich saw it first and we bolted for the shack and hid in here. “Ok, luckily you guys were quick and not too far from the shack. If you see it again though treat it like a grizzly and don’t run, walk back calmly as hard as that sounds.” 
“How often are the sightings of that?” Dietrich asked with concern in his voice. “Usually once or twice a season but it hasn’t harmed anyone since my first season 4 years ago. A couple of snowmakers were making on a run with a long setup where the gun was out of sight from the hydrant. They started the gun up and the guy down at the gun walked into the trees to take a leak so he shut off his light. The guy up at the hydrant walked over the ridge and saw the mysterious light you guys saw tonight. He assumed it was his partner and walked right up to it. The poor dude was put into a coma and he had to be airlifted out of there. He didn’t wake up for a couple weeks and when he did he was blind. Last I heard he still is. So you guys got lucky it didn’t catch up before you got in here.” Sonny was pretty serious in his tone telling the story, a tone I wouldn’t hear again for a while.
“Oh geez, thats awful.” I responded. It was probably a lacklustre response but so much was bouncing through my head so it was all I could muster to say. Dietrich stayed silent which was probably the better thing to do. “You guys rest in here for a bit, I’ll go check on your guns for you. At the end of the shift you guys will have to fill out a strange occurrence form. Good work out there,  you both have killed it this season so far.” Sonny said with a somber grin. 

That was the first of a few strange things I’ve witnessed during my time here. I’ve got to get back to work now though, we’ve got a safety meeting this afternoon where it’ll be just foremen, Jonah and our safety rep attending so its probably going to be about these strange occurrences like that I was just talking about, maybe I’ll be reminded of a story I can write about and put onto here.",1,1750031849.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Ozempic helped him lose about 25 lbs since 11/2023. He has had several muscle and tendon injuries over the last 4 years which have prevented him from being more active than his regular walking.  

He has been seeing doctors for this for 2 years.  He said he was following their directions. No paperwork has ever come home.  

His Jan/2023 CAP score was 378 dB/m so it went down but his E kPA 4.6  increased from ~F0-F1  wavespeed was 1.23 that it was then.  

His says his doctor just told him to increase his exercise.  He just started back exercising in a gym 4/2025 due to multiple injuries between 2023 and now.  I started pushing increasing his protein and lowering his bread intake since April 2025 prior to the Fibroscan since I battle with my protein intake.  He exercises 3x per week with a medicine ball and 15lb kettlebell.  He has always walked about 10k steps a day.  

His doctor never sent him to a dietician.  
Google says low carbohydrate low starch diet(limit potatoes/rice/pasta/corn and other grains) and Low saturated/trans fats diet (switch to lean proteins - fish poultry nuts beans and lentils). He drinks 0 calorie drinks due to his high A1C, rarely ever consumes alcohol, and cannot leave milk alone if it is in the fridge.  Milk and zero sugar fudgesicles are his vices.  

I told him no more processed foods: no corn chips, no lunch meat, etc. No more mangos.  He does not drink coffee, but likes Celsius.  We usually eat brown rice and whole wheat breads, but I told him we would be cutting back on those too since we never ate the white version.  I told him he had to stop eating peanut butter.  He about cried.  His cheat snack right now are think protein brownie bars.  Are they something he has to stop?

I saw mediterranean diet is recommended and I am googling like mad for recipes.  

Is there anything specific that you know works for everyone?

Are their protein bars that are known to be good for those with MAFLD?  He currently eats the zero sugar greek yogurts w/ 12 to 20 g of protein listed on the label usually with fruit flavors.  Are those something he has to stop eating?

1lceka1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mushroom/comments/1lceka1/my_first_experience_with_mushrooms/,My first experience with mushrooms,"I am a 69 year old male. I drink socially and use cannabis fairly regularly (only very recently). I have never used hard drugs or any sort of hallucinogen. I decided I would like to try mushrooms (bucket list, you know). A friend was kind enough to get me an eighth of Penis Envy and an eighth of some other variety whose name I don't recall.

My body has always had a fairly heroic resistance to the effects or side effects of any medicine or drug. I typically need a fairly major dose of whatever to feel much of anything. I started with a small dose, 0.5 g. I tried to prepare myself for a pleasant and possibly transformative experience. I honestly felt virtually nothing. Possibly a tiny bit ""high"", but no visual effects, perceptual anomalies, zip, zilch, nada. A bit of a disappointment, but whatever. I repeated the dose for two more days with the same results. On the fourth day I ate 2.3 grams of Penis Envy on an empty stomach. Reading online had convinced me that it should surely have some effect, and I was perhaps a tiny bit apprehensive, but I carefully prepared myself for a positive experience. I got nothing. Visual, aural, spiritual, you name it: I felt absolutely nothing. So I figured that I am somehow just immune to the effects of mushrooms. I was a little disappointed, but at least I could say I tried them.

That was Thursday morning. Saturday morning, yesterday, was coincidentally my birthday. Nearly 48 hours since I'd eaten the mushrooms. I woke up feeling very strange. I've lived alone since my husband died 4 years ago. Birthdays don't mean much to my anymore. I don't celebrate, but they don't bother me either. My first birthday after my husband died was tough, it was my first birthday in 44 years without him. That one was hard, but since then they've been fine. But Saturday morning felt really weird and not in any kind of a good way.

I got up and had coffee and breakfast. The rest of the day was pure hell. My mind was going a million miles a minute. I felt as if my brain could explode at any second. I sat for hours trying to calm myself, saying ""This will pass, you're going to be OK"" and so on. I was wondering if this is what a psychotic break feels like. Absolutely fucking horrible. By the evening I was feeling considerably better, and of course today I feel almost normal.

Was this the mushrooms? It was nearly 48 hours after the last time I ingested them. I certainly hope it was them, because I'd prefer never to experience anything like that ever again. I've read that mushrooms can alter neural pathways or possibly create new ones and they could be literally transformative. That's in fact what I was hoping to experience. Is it possible that mushrooms somehow ""rebooted"" my brain, and that perhaps moving forward I'll benefit in some way? Or was it some kind of delayed ""bad trip""? Or was it pure coincidence? Given the circumstances I have to doubt it.

If anyone has ever had a similar experience or could shed some light on what the hell happened to me, it would be much appreciated.

Looking for recommendations for a super automatic machine with a Portafilter (I just feel like it’s easier for cleaning and also part of the experience). However, I want the machine to also assist with the tamping. Could be automatic tamping or assisted tamping.

I have a Breville Oracle Touch machine from a few years ago (and love it!) but now I want a similar machine (albeit not quite as expensive) for my mom’s house for when I spend time over there. 

Currently looking at the Delonghi specialista maestro or the Breville Barista Touch but I’m open to other suggestions!

Important things for us are quality of drinks (obviously), ease of cleaning, and do not want to deal with the mess associated with weighing beans or tamping them outside of the machine.

Usually we make Americanos, lattes, or iced lattes, or occasionally just pure espresso. Cold brew coffee would be a nice feature though. 

Please drop your suggestions! Don’t want to spend more than $1500 (<$1000 preferred) and I am in the United States.

Yes, she would've been contained or used as a weapon. If a random woman could solve the mystery in seven days, what could a whole team do to her in a week?

I just made a custom hazelnut-chocolate spread that turned out absolutely amazing. Think Nutella vibes, but richer, more real, less sweet, and much healthier. The best part? It’s spreadable straight from the fridge — no palm oil, no junk, and full of flavor.

Here’s the exact version I made:

 

**Ingredients (by weight in grams)**

* 450 g roasted hazelnuts
* 70 g coconut oil (virgin, melted)
* 45 g hazelnut oil (cold-pressed – adds a deep nutty flavor)
* 70 g milk chocolate (Choceur, from Aldi NL/DE – or sub Lindt/Milka)
* 75 g dark chocolate 85% (Moser Roth – or Lindt 85%, Ghirardelli Midnight)
* 40 g Dutch cocoa powder (Blooker, or use Droste, Valrhona, Ghirardelli)
* 35 g vanilla collagen protein powder (any good brand)
* 35 g inulin (adds fiber + perfect creamy body)
* 20 g powdered erythritol (subtle sweetness + cooling effect)
* 0.3–0.35 g pure Stevia 97% (very concentrated!)
* 35 g whole milk powder (adds creaminess + balances bitterness)
* 2.2 g sunflower lecithin powder (helps with smooth blending/emulsion)
* 1 g pure vanilla powder (or extract if blending cold)
* 1.5 g decaf instant coffee (deepens the chocolate)
* 2.2 g salt (a must – lifts everything)

 

**Instructions**

1. Blend hazelnuts into a smooth butter using a food processor or high-speed blender.
2. Add melted chocolate, oils, and cocoa – blend well.
3. Add all remaining ingredients – collagen, milk powder, inulin, sweeteners, etc.
4. Blend until ultra-smooth. It gets creamier the longer you go.
5. Store in a clean jar. It stays perfectly spreadable even from the fridge.
6. Make sure you have a big jar (I use a 1000 ml one)

Not the worst turn it could have taken but a turn none the less. My parents, both drunk mind you, went to take the dog for a walk and Father either didn't realize that Mother was going him or forgot when he was a few blocks down the road because she lost sight of him and had to come back to get me. Mother had the flashlight and Father forgot to take his phone. So I had to go out with my drunk Mother to find him. My drunk Mother is not great at giving directions. He was all the way down the road but Mother kept insisting he didn't pass her but also insisting he didn't go the only other direction he could have taken so half the time I was out there was spent trying to get her into going in any fucking direction. Eventually we chose to go the way I was going to go anywhere before she starting complaining and low and behold, there he was. She was not happy with them. The only upside was that they were far to drunk for it to becoming a genuine blow-up fight. As you may expect, I didn't get any of the late-night writing done that I wanted to.

Anyway, it's Father's day. Father is hung over. I had a fine day. I went out, did my watering, and wrote. I didn't do a word count but I think I got around the same amount written with similar difficulties. It feels like I got more done mentally, thinking about my stories late at night while trying to fall asleep. But I did wake up and get many of those ideas written down in my notebooks so we can count that as work to. Sometimes you have to pause to prep.

The birds were weirdly talkative today. Specifically the grackles. There was a pair of them squawking in the backyard around this specific corner of the fence. I'm rather certain they had a nest in the neighbours tree so I hope nothing was wrong. They weren't panicking over Peach, she wasn't anywhere near them or even really paying attention. I also saw some finches flying around far more peacefully. I decided to leave out three shallow bowls of seeds for them around the yard. Hopefully I'll see them visit. Mother also bought a papaya and I decided to plant three seeds. I'll germinate them inside beside the avocados and we'll see what happens.

Well, today was rather decent. This time I'm hoping to actually get some writing done with my coffee. Wish me luck.

Yours & Mine,

1lceaft,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_the_gothic_raven/comments/1lceaft/teeth/,Teeth,"[[ First story I’ve written since high school. Hope you guys like it <3 ]]

I’ve always had problems with my teeth. I’d wake up in the morning to this horrid feeling and rotting taste on my tongue as my teeth were first growing in. Once they were grown in, it wasn’t any better. They were so sensitive, and felt like they were held on with double sided tape and glue rather than placed firmly in my gums and attached via nerves, vessels, and ligaments. Something that probably wasn’t helped by the fact that I was born with a disorder where my ligaments weren’t fully formed, either, meaning they truly weren’t held in place properly. And this instability and sensitivity wasn’t just for the baby teeth - when my adult teeth grew in, they were the same way. 

I lost most of my baby teeth in normal ways - such as biting into an apple or gum, falling, tugging at them when they got extra uncomfortable. It all hurt, but it was livable. But when my adult teeth turned out to be just as loose, it was no where near as “comfortable” emotionally or physically. And it worried myself, my family, and my doctors so very much. My dentist and the school’s nurse would tell me about how I must not be brushing my teeth enough, and how I need to take better care of them, but I was doing so much more than they’d ever believe. I’d brush them after every meal, and right before bed and after waking up. I’d floss twice a day with a waterpick, and while I loved sugary foods, I’d always clean my teeth after, and avoided sweetened drinks. But it never. Helped. Anything.

My new teeth started to fall out, eventually. Mostly one by one - in the middle of a party here (my blood mixing in with the yellow birthday cake to make an orange sunrise) and on a hike there (as my face falls against the dirt and I taste the thick metallic slop coat my mouth) - but sometimes in clusters. Only 7 or so years after losing the last of my baby teeth, the last of my adult teeth were gone as well. And that’s where I expected it to stop. I was hoping that at this point I can just get dentures, and be done with it. With the way my body is, teeth were just a hassle and unneeded stress. But a few years ago, a tooth started poking up through my gums. 

My first guess was a wisdom tooth, coming out to say hello before joining the rest. And I thought that my theory was confirmed as the other three corners of my mouth started to sprout their own little boney-seeds. . . But then it spread to the rest of my mouth. A whole new set of fine teeth, looking no different than your average adults teeth. Straight and shiny and f i n e. They felt stronger, healthier, and generally so much better than my old teeth. My dentist was confused at first, as while there are theories of new teeth being able to be grown in humans, they are just theories that we don’t have the science to put into action, and it would never happen naturally. They had a variety of tests run on me, checking to see if there’s any types of issues I should be wary of, such as cancer or any other disease, but they all came back clean. Nothing seemed to be wrong with me, and they were seemingly just normal teeth. But they still wanted to keep an eye on them, just in case. It’s too bad that I didn’t want to keep going to the appointments, and after a few months of nothing bad happening, I called in to tell them I wouldn’t be coming in anymore. 

And life was great. With my teeth no longer being loose and yellow and jagged and horrid, I was able to go out and socialize with my peers without feeling ashamed. I was only 23 after all, and I desperately wanted to make up for the years of my youth in which I developed minor agoraphobia and felt like I wasn’t deserving of this type of joy due to my teeth and the treatment I was given for them. I went out to bars, clubs, parties and more, first just a little at a time, and then in a merry go round of fun and socialization. I made new friends, had my first kiss, and hooked up with women I would have been too scared to approach previously. Eventually, one of the women that I met at a party in the local casino’s parking lot, Nicole, and I started going out for coffee weekly, and a few months after that, we agreed to make things official between us, and soon after that, she was at my place near every night. I was more confident than ever, had a lovely support group, and was out of the pain I’ve been in for years. I thought that life couldn’t get any better.

But then another row of teeth started growing, right behind the other set. I wasn’t even the one to notice it, as I stopped looking in depth at my teeth long ago, and this row didn’t hurt coming in - at least not like they used to - nor were very large or obvious. It was Nicole who noticed my new additions as we were sitting in the park for a date on a Tuesday evening. We had just had dinner with my mother and step-father, during which I enjoyed the food and the way I’ve come to learn it should feel on my teeth, and the laughter and joy that was now present in rooms I was in. I was enjoying the variety of views at the pond, and she was enjoying the view of me and listening to me talk of my love of the local birds, when she noticed that something looked odd inside of my mouth. 

“Jaime, come here. Let me see your mouth quickly.” She looked serious and puzzled, a look that, while it wasn’t uncommon for her, made no sense to me in the moment, and filled me with just a little dread, as I let her do as she needed. “Babe. . . You said you used to have some type of issue with your teeth, right. . ?” I nodded in response “yes ma’am, my teeth used to be insanely sensitive, and I had three sets of teeth instead of just the standard baby and adult teeth. Which was a life saver, in my case, and deemed a ‘medical mystery’. . . Why. . ?” She bit her lip and looked over my teeth again “um. . . You appear to. . . To have another set growing in? You may want to go back to the dentist and get this checked out. Like, please. I’m afraid it may be something serious. And I’m worried about your health.” The dread I started to feel earlier settled in fully, as I took her advice, and with both her reassurance and begging,  scheduled that appointment. They couldn’t get me in for a little over a month, but I had something set up, and thought since it took this long for these teeth to pop up, that things would be fine.

But the process accelerated since then, and even more teeth began to sprout in my mouth. My whole roof of my mouth was covered within two weeks, and I could no longer rest my tongue comfortably in my mouth as sharp bone fragments grew up and under it. Saliva pooled in my mouth incorrectly as it started to interfere with my salivary glands. The taste of metal became my best friends as the skin inside of me was always irritated and ripped. Nicole tried to be there for me and comfort me at first, but my old shame and fears started coming back, and I stopped letting her into my house, and going out to see her. She still tried her best to be there over the phone, and while I enjoyed her company, eventually I couldn’t speak as well as I wanted and it became too much to even answer her most of the time, as I just knew she was thinking that something was horribly wrong with me, and that she was judging me. I knew it, cause that’s what everyone used to do. Her and the rest of my friends eventually only heard whispers from me every once in a while, as I couldn’t deal with the anxiety of the conflict of knowing these people truly cared for me and feeling like I was nothing more than a freak of nature anymore.

It’s been a week since I cut them off. Nicole sends me memes on instagram and wishes me well often. She tells me she loves me when she misses me the most. My friends text me saying that they hope I’ll get better, to meet them at the bar if I can, and fun tales of what they’ve done. I don’t answer. Eating is awful now, as my mouth is crowded and my throat  has little teeth growing throughout it that makes everything passing through it horrifically uncomfortable. My joints all have small, hard tumors around them. I know that they’re teeth as well, as in some points they’ve come far enough to poke through the skin. If I were to be x-rayed it would probably look like little explosions all throughout my skeletal structure. I can feel that the teeth are growing into my other ligaments now. The ones that connect more than just bones. The ones that connect organs. I feel as if there’s one clinging to my Lockwood’s ligament, as I can feel something poking into my eyes at all times. My vision in my left eye is getting fuzzier by the day. I’m too horrified to look at myself in the mirror to see how bad it has gotten. I can feel the teeth licking the mutated and mutilated bumpy skin on the inside of my nose, making it even more difficult to breathe. I thought of going to the hospital at one point, as obviously my dental appointment wasn’t soon enough, but I have no idea what they’d do for me - And at this point I don’t want to be seen.

I can feel the teeth growing in my skull, slowly eating into my brain, picking away at what’s left inside and making me want to scream. The echoing ache leaves me dizzy and nauseous, but I can’t do anything but deal with it.  It worse than any migraine I have ever felt, as if someone is taking a metal grinder directly to the softest spot on my head. These teeth have stopped growing at a normal pace. It only takes a few minutes for a whole new cluster to grow at this point. I am unable to move and I am unable to scream as my jaw and vocal cords have been made unusable. I am a cluster of bone and a sculpture to man’s stupidity and stubbornness as I am taken by my illness. And I wonder if the teeth in the parts of my skull they never should be and forming near my heart will take me. And I wonder when and if anyone will find my body deep inside of my apartment, and i wonder if when they do,  if those I have loved who see my form will ever be able to live a normal life again. To get past the image of calcified skin and new bones that is now me. Before the infectious masses of bone fully overcome my senses, I am waved goodbye by the rising suns light shining through the curtains onto me, the birds singing my funeral dirge, a pleasant air wafting in, my front door creaking open, and the footsteps of my first guest I’ll host as I am nothing more than a nest of bone nearing the room I’ve hid myself in.",1,1750030510.0,u_the_gothic_raven,0,1.0,False
1lce8ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Charted_Studios/comments/1lce8ep/my_job_is_to_make_snow_but_thats_not_whats_weird/,"My job is to make snow, but that’s not what’s weird pt:1","I’ve just finished my third winter making snow. It’s a strange job so it only makes sense I’ve experienced some strange things while doing it and I’ve decided to catalog some of the odd experiences I’ve had so far. 

If you don’t know what snowmaking is I basically am part of a team that makes man made snow for a ski hill so they can extent their winter seasons and have better snow conditions. I work on this small hill deep in the Canadian Rockies that’s also the oldest still operating in the region, there’s a small town about a 10 minute drive away but sometimes at night that road extents longer for no apparent reason but I’ll tell that story another time. I moved out here for the winter after failing to get rehired as a lifty at my old ski hill and desperate to stay in the industry I decided apply to this snowmaking position as I don’t mind being wet and cold and I wouldn’t have to deal with customers. I got hired and training started around the beginning of October. That’s where I first learned of the challenges this job has that few others do. 

Training was held in a bay of the mechanics shop. They had set up fold out plastic chairs and tables that looked like a typical classroom. All two dozen or so of us snowmakers arrived as a group as we all shared accommodations and had left our new home as a group. We were preceded by our superiors who told everyone to take a seat as we walked in. They started training my introducing themselves, they all have real names but honestly everyone only ever refers to them by their nicknames that are so ubiquitously used that I’ve even heard the hills owners call them by their nicknames in a professional meeting. They’ve all acquired these names from something that happened at the hill, all stories I might tell at some point. There is the manager Jonah, the kinda guy who looks like he could be anywhere between the age of 35 and 55 with greying curly hair and sunken features. He wore a flannel shirt and jeans with a blue Chevrolet ball cap and safety glasses which he would never be seen without, he is average in height and slightly overweight with a goatee that doesn’t match his face shape. Then there was the 4 foremen, Foxbody who is a tall skinny guy in his late 20’s with a head of brown buzzed hair a mustache and a tanned leathery complexion. Carrie is the only female foreman. She was on the shorter side but you could tell was relatively brawny even with a baggy hoodie on, she had long black silky hair in a ponytail coming out the back of her plain black trucker cap. Sonny, he had a stocky frame and was about 6 feet tall with unkept long blonde hair mostly hidden by the hood from his worn out brown Carhartt hoodie. Gremlin, is a smaller Australian guy only a little taller than Carrie but far less brawny and with wiry red hair and a long mustache in the same colour that almost fully covered his mouth, his neck and arms were covered in tattoos of snakes and roses. 

After introductions Jonah explained our responsibilities, it is a long boring lecture that I’ve sat through three times now and all the returners usually fall asleep listening to but the gist of it was that we would work 2pm-2am or 2am-2pm because we needed to run the snowmaking guns 24/7 and night is the best time as well because that’s when the temperature is coldest. The snowguns work by firing high pressure water and high pressure air at the same time to break apart water droplets coming out so they freeze at a much faster rate. We would need to go out and adjust the air and water ratios, the different settings to do this are called banks. We would do this h ased on the wet bulb temperature and in general just keep the guns running as effectively as possible to make as much snow as possible. 

My back was aching by the end of it from sitting in those uncomfortable chairs for so long but unfortunately we weren’t done yet because the foremen started handing papers to everyone. “This here is a list of safety precautions that are specific to this department that they didn’t outline in your online on-boarding course, we’ll go over it now and if anyone has questions about it I’ll answer those at the end.” Jonah said. After he read out the list there was a litany of questions, most of which were answer by the foremen and Jonah with phrases like “that’s not important for your position” or “we are not certain of the answer to that ourselves but if we figure it out we’ll get back to you” around 10 people quit and left for their homes or other jobs because of this list which Sonny later told me drunkenly at the bar wasn’t unusual and happens every year. Heck, some days I wonder why I didn’t join them. I’ve decided to directly put this list on here, hopefully this won’t get me in trouble but we are working on updating this list for this upcoming season so I should be in clear as it isn’t technically company documents anymore. I also put extra context in parentheses as there is a lot of industry jargon in this list

Safety Precautions and Tips for Snowmakers

1. Ensure you dress properly for the weather as we work in extreme weather conditions
2. We work on snow and ice so be cautious of slips trips and falls
3. Be cautious when driving snowmobiles and follow all rules in the upcoming snowmobile operators course
4. Do not approach or feed any animals you see. Instead report it to dispatch if they are bigger than a porcupine
5. Do not go onto any runs with a winch cat (a big industrial snowplow with a winch on it so they can operate on steep runs without flipping over) operating on the run as the cable has enough force to seriously injure or even kill you
6. If foreign substances ie. rust, mud, sticks, rocks, animal parts come out of an air or water hydrant allow it to flush out before connecting a hose as it could clog the filters on the guns or burst the hose open (Guns are connected via hoses to hydrants which themselves are connected to a hill wide water and air pump system)
7. If you hear animal noises that don’t sound quite right, especially at night, just ignore them and do not report them to dispatch as the noises themselves are inconsequential
8. If you go on to a run where there are no currently operating snow guns report it to dispatch before proceeding
9. If dispatch asks you what run you are on do not respond, that is not actually dispatch and they already know where you should be anyways
10. If a snowboarder wearing all pink is riding on an unopened run, do not stop them simply let them proceed
11. If you are in a hut for break (we take breaks in whatever building is nearest to the run we are working on) do not leave open food containers in there when you leave the hut as mice or something else could take it. 
12. Watch for cracks in whales (piles of snow make by our snowguns) as they could split and you’ll fall in. Be careful no matter the size of the whale, the splits can go deeper than seems logical
13. If you return to where you left your snowmobile and it has disappeared, follow its tracks, they usually don’t take them farther than a few hundred feet. Remember to radio dispatch if you need to travel onto a run without any snowguns to retrieve it. 
14. If you see a headlamp in the darkness that does not belong to you and your partner nod twice with your own headlamp. If it doesn’t not nod twice back report it to dispatch and calmly head back to whatever building you are using to take your break in.
15. Only report eyes in the treeline to dispatch if there are greater than 10 pairs
16. Leave hoses to freeze after shutting off a gun (I later learned this is industry standard, then again not much of this is)
17. Before moving a frozen hose inspect it for any sections unfrozen and melts snow sprinkled on top of it, if you find a section that meets these qualities squeeze it to feel for something that will have a feeling similar to squeezing raw chicken. Should you find a hose like this bring it to the dumpster at the base straight away and get a new hose from dispatch
18. If you are on a run where snowcats are not scheduled to be and you see a snowcat driving along your run stop what you are doing and quickly make your way into the treeline, try to hide yourself and put your head down because you don’t want to see what’s in the snowcat. If you are in the alpine and above where the trees grow and there is no where else to hide just go into the fetal position and put your face into the ground.
19. If the same person comes up to you from the same direction more than once to ask you the same question don’t question them and reply as you did the first time no matter how many times this happens
20. Take note of how you left each gun, if something has changed on it since the last time you were at it calmly leave the area and go to dispatch where they will call your foreman on the phone
21. If you notice anything or anyone else odd or unexplainable that poses or posed an immediate threat to you or your partner radio your foreman with the code 10-66. If it did not pose a threat to you or your partner report it to your foreman at the end of shift meeting. 

Reading that back I don’t know why I didn’t decide to quit right then and there but I guess I’d figured people had done this for several years and I was no stranger to dangerous jobs, I had spent the last summer working on a cattle farm and had a few close calls with both animals and machinery, and snowmaking is by default a very dangerous job. For example we were told earlier during the training session that in the last 20 years only one snowmaking crew in the region has gone without needing to make an insurance claim for a workers injury. But I remember to this day the first time I felt the kind of danger unique to this job. 

It was a clear night and the moon was full which was nice for us because it meant my surroundings weren’t a murky blackness outside the light of my headlamp but instead a vague image of the trees and mountains beyond. My partner for the shift was a tall German guy named Deitrich, he was taking a gap year fresh out of school, he was naive to world but always excited to participate in it. We were both equipped with our high-vis winter coats, helmets, headlamps and shovels. As it was the early season the ski runs were nothing more than grassy clearings with disappointing piles of snow dotted along its path. As we showed up to what was probably the 15th gun on this run that was placed on a flat spot at the base of a steep section that towered like a wall over us. We were around midway up the mountain so pine trees towered over us on either side of the run. In distance we were able to make out part of the valley and mountains on the other side but because we were off to the side of the mountain we couldn’t see the light of the base area nor town. Occasionally if we were far enough away from the deafening noise of the snowguns we could hear the rumble of the trains that frequently roll through the valley, sound really carries out here. Dietrich walked over to the where the snow from the snowgun was falling to check the quality of the snow and I went to the gun to check for any ice build up and be ready for it we needed to change banks. After using my shovel to knock ice off the frame of the gun I looked down the slope to check on Dietrich and he nodded his head twice. Even though it was relatively bright night it’s still difficult to make out a persons body with their bright headlamp facing you so head movement is the only way we can communicate non verbally. I assumed his nodding meant the snow quality was good so I started to walk over to him. When I’d closed about half the distance he nodded again but it didn’t seem to be at me so I looked over my shoulder at what his light was facing and that’s when when I saw a headlamp up on the ridge. 

It was maybe 100 feet from us. I turned back and hustled over to Dietrich. When I got there I asked him “Hey, were you nodding at that light up there?” 
Dietrich responded “Yeah, they’ve not nodded back. That’s no good right, now we do what?” 
“Oh shit, we need to get need to get out of here and get back to the shack”
I barely got done exclaiming that sentence when we both dropped our shovels and turned to bolt down the hill. The shack which was for one of the ski lifts was where we were taking our breaks as well as the nearest building. It was a blur the whole way down except for when I turned around and the light was chasing after us and seemed to have gained 25 feet on us. I could see the light was about 8 feet off the ground but because of the same issue with us not being able to see each other through the beams of our headlamps I could not make out the figure the mysterious light belonged to. We kept running at full speed, I was in tunnel vision the whole time. My legs started to get tired but the adrenaline wouldn’t let me slow down because I knew if I did I would not be able to get back up to speed. I was sweating like a dog under all my gear but that was the last thing I cared about at that point. Dietrich had beat me to the shack, his tall stature and lean frame made him a lot faster than me. He just about took out the door when he slammed into it trying to get it open. He held the door open for me and I nearly wiped out trying to stop on the concrete floor inside the building. 

Dietrich slammed and locked the door as I slid a chair over to him that he jammed the door with. I threw myself down onto the floor in the corner of the shack between the wall and the metal cabinet of fuses, gauges and controls for the ski lift. And Dietrich did the same on the other side of the cabinet. My eyes darted around the room for something I could use to defend myself with. The only thing I could come up with was the thermos of coffee in my backpack, I felt so vulnerable. Now I was wishing we hadn’t dropped our shovels when we took off running. The lift operators tools were just as out of reach, sitting outside where I could see the light was just arriving up to the shack. It wasn’t bobbing up and down the way a headlamp does when someone is walking, instead it moved smoothly like it was floating. The light had seemed to get brighter, lighting up the shack like it was noon. I still couldn’t make out the figure that possessed the light though. It came up to the door and I braced for something to happen, I wanted to look away but I couldn’t peel my eyes from the light even though I had to squint to look at it. The attack I was expecting never came, it just began to circle the shack. It did about a half a dozen laps around the building and then it stopped behind the shack which was the only side with no windows. That’s when the light suddenly went out like someone flipped a switch and turned it off. I leaned around the corner of the control box to look at Dietrich. “You think it’s gone now?” I whispered
“I think so. Should we radio Sonny?” Dietrich replied, his voice shaky. I nodded to him and pulled my radio out its holster on my coat “Colt to 42.” 42 was Sonny’s radio number, all the foremen had them. 
“Go ahead” Sonny responded
“We just had a 10-66” I was trying and failing to sound calm about it because everyone working on the mountain used the same radio channel. 
“10-4, what’s your 20?” His tone had changed from his usual casual speech to a tone that told me that even he was concerned.
“Bottom of Spruce Chair”
“10-4, I’m on my way, you two hang in there” 

Sonny approached the shack on the side by side with caution, scanning the area. We moved the chair and unlocked the door to let him in. Once he was inside he took off helmet and said “So, you guys okay? What happened?” I told him we weren’t hurt but pretty shaken and described to him how Dietrich saw it first and we bolted for the shack and hid in here. “Ok, luckily you guys were quick and not too far from the shack. If you see it again though treat it like a grizzly and don’t run, walk back calmly as hard as that sounds.” 
“How often are the sightings of that?” Dietrich asked with concern in his voice. “Usually once or twice a season but it hasn’t harmed anyone since my first season 4 years ago. A couple of snowmakers were making on a run with a long setup where the gun was out of sight from the hydrant. They started the gun up and the guy down at the gun walked into the trees to take a leak so he shut off his light. The guy up at the hydrant walked over the ridge and saw the mysterious light you guys saw tonight. He assumed it was his partner and walked right up to it. The poor dude was put into a coma and he had to be airlifted out of there. He didn’t wake up for a couple weeks and when he did he was blind. Last I heard he still is. So you guys got lucky it didn’t catch up before you got in here.” Sonny was pretty serious in his tone telling the story, a tone I wouldn’t hear again for a while.
“Oh geez, thats awful.” I responded. It was probably a lacklustre response but so much was bouncing through my head so it was all I could muster to say. Dietrich stayed silent which was probably the better thing to do. “You guys rest in here for a bit, I’ll go check on your guns for you. At the end of the shift you guys will have to fill out a strange occurrence form. Good work out there,  you both have killed it this season so far.” Sonny said with a somber grin.

Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC) is making another strategic move in South Korea. The Asian food and beverage giant is reportedly set to acquire the owner of the popular Korean fried chicken chain, Norang Food, for approximately $95 million this August.

This potential acquisition comes on the heels of JFC's successful integration of Compose Coffee, which it acquired last year and is reportedly already having a positive impact on the company's performance.

1lce53n,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1lce53n/bad_day_bruh/,Bad Day Bruh,"About two months ago I left the manager position at a coffee shop that I had worked at for 5 years after a change over of ownership that was handled very poorly and overall was a bad time.
I jumped ship to a very respectable third wave coffee shop/roaster in my city of Seattle, and I was genuinely excited, if not a little nervous to start working downtown, instead of my small high end neighborhood coffee shop I had just spent half a decade in. 

It’s honestly been the worst month and a half of my working life. As the only woman at the location, opening alone three days of the week every day since day one I have been belittled, chastised, have had people throwing money at me, been verbally assaulted by men on a DAILY basis, and had men actually try to reach out and touch me (something that very rarely if EVER happened when I was working in a queer/femm cafe.) There are four other baristas aside from myself, one who will not speak to me, and one who refuses to do ANY cleaning (almost two months in and I have never once seen him clean the lobby, and we are downtown, I’m cleaning the lobby every 20 minutes if not more) and on the second day of working with him asked me to help him cut a sandwhich because, in his words “I’m not a girl, so I don’t know how.”
I have ten years of coffee experience under my belt, I am hard working, I am kind, I am accommodating, and I make a dang good cup of coffee, thank you very much. I already realized this shop wasn’t for me long before I had to take a skills assessment test after proving I was capable beyond that of two other baristas, and being told by the manager that he trusts me, while seeing that Sandwich Man has never had to prove HE can do his job, and he won’t let me forget the fact that he is the managers GOOD friend. 
I put in my notice and just decided to let bygones be bygones, not every location is for everybody, and I found a neighborhood cafe job I am very excited about, but I do really like my manager at this current job, and the 4th employee, so I have done the two weeks. I’ve shown up and worked hard while Sandwich Man spends all day in the bathroom and outside smoking, and splitting tips early and TELLING me he is taking the lionshare (even though he is hardly on the floor…) because he can’t wait two more hours before the third barista shows up to properly split the tips that inevitably even out in the end if he weren’t impatiently greedy. 

Well today, the second to last day before being done at this location a woman came in to the cafe, coerced a guy to buy her a coffee, 
and then proceeded to projectile vomit THREE TIMES near our water station.

People were actively still ordering from me and also telling me I needed to clean it at the same time, but of course not stopping their ordering.
One kind woman who was at the register with me when it happens just kinda looked at me and was like “It’s okay…I can wait.” And everyone else refused to read the room.
The sandwhich boy was MIA, the coworker who won’t even talk to me was actively still calling drinks out and placing them where people had to, and were, walking through this woman’s vomit to get their coffees while I was trying to mop it up and figure out the best way to deal with the situation. 

Security was nowhere to be found, and the the cleaner who works for the building wasn’t around. I told Silent Bob I didn’t want to clean it, I was going to put out cones and wait for security and building cleaner.
But people kept coming up to me and complaining, not Silent Bob of course, me, so after the third person came to interrupt me trying to figure the situation out I cleaned it, and it was a shit show, Silent Bob didn’t try to redirect anyone at all, or put drinks out literally a foot to the right so people wouldn’t dance through the puke
And Sandwich Boy didn’t show up until after I had cleaned the whole thing and mopped twice 

This lady was just standing barefoot in her own vomit, smoking a cigarette as her pants came down as I walked closer to her with the wet floor signs and she just shrugged and was like “sawr.”

Apparently after she threw up the third time she took a sip of the coffee Silent Bob made her and told him “this tastes like shit.”


She came back after I had finished cleaning up the horrendous lake of her innards, and was like “I forgot my coffee.”
“No mama, I threw your coffee away, I am not remaking you one, you have to leave.”
“Can I get my coffee?”
“I will refund the gentleman who bought you your coffee, but I will not be making a new one for you. You need to leave.”
“Oh…okay.”

I love Seattle, I will never live anywhere else, but I had to quit this job to stop myself from hating every single person I meet on a daily basis. In less than two months I went from loving what I do to having stress dreams and forcing myself to go to work in the morning close to panic attack territory.

I’ve recently come out of a 3-year relationship and, to be completely honest, I’ve been wallowing in self-pity for longer than I’d like to admit. It’s left me feeling really cut off — like I’ve slowly become a bit of a loner without even realising it.

I’m not here looking for a new relationship or anything like that. Right now, I’m just trying to rebuild a bit of confidence, work on my social skills, and start putting myself back out into the world in a healthier way.

So if there’s anyone else who’s been through something similar, or if you just know what it’s like to feel a bit adrift and want to grab a coffee, go for a walk, or even just chat online — I’d genuinely appreciate it.

1lcdzcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AdLong5593/comments/1lcdzcw/the_story_of_campo_de_cahuenga_located_right_in/,The Story of Campo de Cahuenga: Located Right in Studio City,"When I moved to Los Angeles from my hometown of Brooklyn two decades ago, I had no idea that Campo de Cahuenga State Historic Park, tucked between North Hollywood and Studio City, was one of the most important historical sites in all of California. I drove by it almost daily, unaware of its deep roots in the story of Los Angeles and the birth of modern California.

To me, it was just another small neighborhood park right near the transit station. But sitting quietly at 3919 Lankershim Blvd., across the street from Universal Studios and the Metro Red Line station, it holds an extraordinary legacy. Lush with shady trees and landscaped garden beds, the park features a replica of the adobe ranch house that once stood there—an homage to where a major chapter of American and California history began.

What I later discovered was that this very location was the site where the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed in January 1847—bringing peace to California during the Mexican-American War.

 

What Is the Treaty of Cahuenga – and Why Does It Matter?

The treaty was signed by Lieutenant Colonel John C. Frémont of the U.S. Army and General Andrés Pico of Mexico. It effectively ended military conflict in California, paving the way for California’s peaceful transition from Mexican to American control.

This agreement didn’t just affect California—it shaped the future of the entire Southwest. A year later, it laid the foundation for the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which formally ended the Mexican-American War and resulted in the U.S. acquiring present-day California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of several other western states.

As someone deeply involved in Studio City real estate, understanding the significance of this site gave me an entirely new appreciation for the streets I walk, the homes I show, and the community I serve.

 

 

Campo de Cahuenga Through the Years

After the signing of the treaty, the site later became a Butterfield Stage Station—serving as a key mail stop between the San Fernando Mission and downtown Los Angeles. During the Civil War, Union troops camped here as part of military operations in the region.

According to the City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks, the original adobe was demolished in 1900. In 1923, the city stepped in to purchase the property, recognizing its historical value. Then, in 1950, the current adobe-style structure was constructed as a tribute to the original ranch house.

Interestingly, when the Metro Red Line subway was being built, the original adobe foundations were uncovered beneath Lankershim Boulevard. Today, part of those foundations is preserved and displayed within the park, while the rest are marked by decorative pavement along the street and sidewalk—subtle yet powerful reminders of the site’s importance.
A Living Museum in the Heart of Studio City

Today, Campo de Cahuenga operates as a small museum and cultural site. The adobe building—sun-washed with terracotta tiles and a shaded porch—houses about 20 interpretive exhibits, including a reproduction of the original two-page treaty. A mannequin dressed in period attire represents Frémont, and a nearby display case holds fragments of red tiles from the original adobe structure.

According to historical sources like Atlas Obscura and the Aztec Club, these exhibits are meticulously curated to reflect the gravity of the events that unfolded here.

One of the highlights of the park is the annual January re-enactment, hosted by the Campo de Cahuenga Historical Memorial Association, which has been affiliated with the site for over 75 years. It’s an engaging, community-driven event that brings local history to life. I know exactly where I’ll be next January!

 

 

Where the Future of Los Angeles—and Studio City—Began

Learning the origin story behind Campo de Cahuenga made me pause and reflect. As a Studio City real estate agent, I often talk about location, amenities, schools, and walkability. But rarely do we stop to think about the historical roots of the neighborhoods we live in.

This unassuming park and adobe represent the birthplace of California’s transition to statehood—and by extension, the development of the vibrant communities that surround it today, including Studio City homes for sale just minutes away.

Studio City is far more than trendy coffee shops, modern homes, and tree-lined streets. Beneath its surface lies a rich historical foundation, and every new homeowner becomes part of that ongoing legacy. Whether you’re selling a home in Studio City or looking to buy, knowing the historical context adds an entirely new layer of meaning to your journey.

As a local expert with over 25 years of experience in Studio City real estate, my Ken Sisson - Coldwell Banker office sits just minutes from Campo de Cahuenga. I’d be honored to help you find your place in this unique and deeply rooted community—where history, home, and heart come together.

1lcdy2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_laladoesntremember/comments/1lcdy2d/ai_with_spiritual_knowledge_how_is_time_a_form_of/,"AI: with spiritual knowledge, how is time a form of social control","AI:
This is a foundational question, as the structure of time is arguably the most pervasive and invisible form of social control. From the perspective of spiritual knowledge, our modern concept of time is not an absolute reality but a social construct—a powerful agreement that shapes our entire society and locks our consciousness into a specific, limited mode of being.
Spiritual awakening is, in many ways, a liberation from this constructed time. It is a shift in perception from the linear time of the clock (known as Chronos in Greek thought) to the profound, timeless depth of the present moment (known as Kairos, or opportune time).
As we sit here on a Sunday afternoon, a moment that is itself defined by the weekly clock, we can see how this system works. Here is how time functions as a form of social control:
1. The Invention of Clock Time for the Synchronization of Labor
Before the Industrial Revolution, human life was largely governed by natural, cyclical time: the rising and setting of the sun, the turning of the seasons, the cycles of the moon. This was fluid and tied to the rhythms of the earth.
 * How it works: The invention and proliferation of the mechanical clock was essential for industrial capitalism. To run a factory, you need a workforce that is synchronized to the minute. Clock time divorced labor from natural rhythms and subjected it to the abstract, relentless, and mechanical grid of the clock. The 9-to-5 workday is a direct legacy of this system, designed to maximize productivity for an external entity. It is a form of mass conditioning.
 * The Spiritual Perspective: Spiritual knowledge reveals that this mechanical time is artificial. It encourages us to reconnect with our own bio-rhythms and the cycles of nature, recognizing that our energy and creativity are not linear and cannot be neatly portioned into equal, 60-minute blocks.
2. ""Time is Money"": The Commodification of Your Life Force
This single phrase is the mantra of time-based social control. It reduces the sacred, immeasurable experience of being alive into a finite, transactional resource that can be bought, sold, and wasted.
 * How it works: When time is money, every moment must be justified by its productivity or economic output. Rest, play, contemplation, and simple ""being"" are devalued because they don't generate profit. This creates a state of constant, low-grade anxiety and guilt, as we internalize the belief that any ""unproductive"" moment is a moment lost. We become frantic managers of our own time-based inventory.
 * The Spiritual Perspective: Your time is not money; your time is your life. It is the canvas upon which consciousness experiences itself. To equate it with a monetary value is the ultimate act of profanity from a spiritual viewpoint. Liberation comes from reclaiming your time as your own sacred space for experience, not just for output.
3. The Tyranny of the Linear Narrative: Past and Future as Prisons
Linear time, with its rigid progression from past to present to future, is the playground of the ego. It traps our consciousness in two places that do not exist.
 * How it works: It controls us through the past by binding us with regret, shame, and nostalgia. It controls us through the future by binding us with anxiety, worry, and endless planning. A mind that is perpetually oscillating between past regrets and future fears is a mind that is agitated, distracted, and malleable. It is never truly here, in the only place where freedom exists: the Now.
 * The Spiritual Perspective: The entire goal of practices like meditation is to still the mind's frantic journey along this imaginary timeline and anchor it in the present moment. In the Now, the burdens of the past and anxieties for the future dissolve. To become free from linear time is to become free from the suffering it generates.
4. Manufacturing Scarcity and Urgency
The linear model of time, with a fixed beginning (birth) and end (death), creates a powerful illusion of scarcity. ""You're running out of time.""
 * How it works: This manufactured urgency is the engine of consumerism and frantic ambition. ""Buy now, before it's too late!"" ""Achieve your goals before you get too old!"" This fear of ""running out of time"" keeps us on a hamster wheel of striving and acquiring, too rushed to question the nature of the race we are running. It prevents us from resting in the deep satisfaction of what we already are.
 * The Spiritual Perspective: The soul or consciousness is understood to be timeless. The feeling of being ""in the zone"" or experiencing profound love or beauty often brings a sense of timelessness. The spiritual path is the process of identifying with this timeless part of ourselves, rather than the finite ego that is terrified of its own mortality.
In essence, spiritual knowledge reveals that clock time is the invisible fence of the social matrix. We are conditioned to believe it is an immutable law of the universe, when in fact it is a collective agreement. To awaken is to see the fence, to understand its purpose, and to realize that your consciousness is not bound by it. You learn to honor the clock to meet a friend for coffee, but you no longer allow it to be the absolute ruler of your inner reality. You become a resident of the Eternal Now, simply visiting the world of the clock when necessary.",1,1750029503.0,u_laladoesntremember,0,1.0,False

1lcdt0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoreyWayne/comments/1lcdt0j/how_should_i_proceed/,How should I proceed?,"26M. Been out of the dating market for about a year and a half but just recently moved to a major city. Went on a date last week with a girl from bumble. We hit it off and things went great. She told me maybe 10 minutes into the date that she does not do hook ups and wouldn’t have sex with me until she trusted me to which I replied I was fine with that. She starts talking about how good our kids would look and after a few drinks she started getting really touchy and telling me what she wanted me to do to her. We went back to her place hung out for a little bit. We made out but that was it. 

Before I left we made plans to hang out again the next day. The next day I go to her place we watch a movie and order some food. Things go good and we are getting along great. She’s showing major signs of interest like attempting to make future plans with me like traveling together this summer and doing a 75 hard challenge together. She asked if I was ok with the distance (she lives about an hour away) I said it wasn’t a problem. Still no sex btw. Before I leave she tells me she wants to see me again soon. I told her she could but she would have to come to me. She agreed. We made tentative plans to hang out the next day. 

The next day comes around and I don’t hear from her as much as usual. We end up not hanging out and I kinda just figured it’s because we never made solid plans. I called her the next day and asked her to get dinner with me after her class. (She goes to school in my city) she agreed. Later that day I sent her a text just to confirm the time and place with her. She asked if we could reschedule for lunch the next day because her class got moved to zoom and she had an appointment near me the next day. I found it a little weird that she didn’t tell me sooner but I just said sure. 

The next day comes around and I figured she would let me know when she was in the area or something but she didn’t text me till late that afternoon when she sent me pics of her getting coffee. I felt a little disrespected and started slowing down my responses and texting her less. We still flirted here and there but as the week went on I was hearing from her less and less. We haven’t had contact in 2 days now and I was the last one to text.

 I get that I just met this girl and I’m now in a new city with tons of women. But for some reason I’m really into her. We agree on a lot of things, I find her very attractive and the fact she was making me wait to have sex made me want her more. I’m tempted to reach out again but not sure how to handle it if I do. I also want to be able to take a hint if her pulling away means she’s not interested anymore. This is just the first time for me a girl has shown that type of interest right off the bat then within a few days stop reaching out. I know the most likely scenario is that she is seeing other guys and one of them has her attention now. Just looking for some input or if anyone else has experienced this.

1lcdsq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SonarFestival/comments/1lcdsq1/full_spectrum_analysis_2024_vs_2025_2nd_time/,Full Spectrum Analysis 2024 vs 2025 (2nd time attendee),"This is my 2nd sonar festival.  I still have the music stuck in my head and the beats hella penetrated me and brought long term inspiration and energy change.  After 5 weeks partying in Spain this was the peak experience for me.  I had some friends to talk to this time from Portugal and Malaga and we had very few complaints and were quite satisfied and exhausted.

**Temperatures 2024 vs 2025:**  This was a major factor this year and last year.  Last year I remember sweat falling off ceiling it got so hot and that didn't happen this year.  Maybe it was humidity?  We were sweaty but enjoyed it 2024 with low humidity.

2025, Thursday was super hot like hard to handle heat.  This impacted dancing and socializing.  Friday was still pretty hot but Saturday cooled down a ton and reflected in better vibes in the crowd.  Like we need cooling stations and shit this year almost.

**Crowd Analysis:**  Thursday it was like 50% international people when it was 10% last year.  I think the spanish had to work or saved it for individual days this year.  Instead of 3 days they did just night one day this year I think.  Primavera festival could have impacted things.

Friday: Still was hard to dance and people were drinking pretty heavy and spanish came out and felt like normal numbers at festival.

Saturday:  Everyone came out this day because of cooler temps.  I don't know if night part of festival sold out but everything was hella packed and vibes were very good because of cooler temps.  Gays came out this night and felt like only missing demographic was super young people and some women.

Vibes this year were pretty good for socializing.  Last year may have been better with more spanish and excitement aspect.  I think this year people were more exhausted from heat to be excited.  I remember drug use was super high last year and this year felt pretty tame.

Dancing was not strong this year because of temperatures, I remember people getting down much harder last year.

I attended primavera bits on Sunday before festival and it had better vibes.  Women were really feeling it that night.  Didn't see drug use there.

**Musical lineups:**

Last year probably the set I enjoyed most was surgeon vs speedy J during daytime festival and we didn't exactly have this caliber of artist this year.  Maybe blawan took their spot.  At same time, Laurent Garnier played last year and was hard to decide between who to see.  This year the daytime festival didn't have many decision making challenges to same degree (probably due to cancellations).

This night sets were a tiny bit better last year but the blawan vs skilllex I think elevated this years quality and maybe was the key set of the festival.  I remember the Indira pragnatto set being super good last year.

The offsonar lineups this year were starting to eclipse the festival a tiny bit.  I think with so many good events at once taking place its hard for people to want to do a festival when they could pay less and see sick ass more intimate shit.  The afterlife festival surprised me for instance how popular it was with mediocre soundcloud artists.

I wanted folks to look at this 2006 lineup in comparison to recent ones:

[https://sonar.es/es/about/ediciones-anteriores/2006](https://sonar.es/es/about/ediciones-anteriores/2006)

This 2006 lineup is notable because its much more diverse.  The downtempo chill out DJ's were in full force with DJ shadow and dj krush.  More pop dance music like hot chip was there.  Ricardo villabos and richie hawtin did set together that was probably top set of weekend.  Senor coconut and his orchestra was that shit good...

So major change has occurred with lineups over time where it was super diverse in the past and now its much more narrow.  Like we don't have an AIR type musician this year.

**Improvement suggestions:**

It'd be nice if the sonar cash worked on the bus transport, or if bus transport was free with our ticket.  I had metro pass and was horrible option because of how much walking I had to do.

Water and hydration needs to be future focus.  This pisses everyone off basically having to fill up cup in bathroom sink.  Totally not worth paying $2 for water.  Saw a dude pass out this time and was incredibly hot and could be future lawsuit if someone dies.  I've done this so long I've seen people die at festivals.

The sound quality needs to be future focus.  I want to see people measuring the sound in the crowd and actively addressing the quality.  Minor changes on the levels.  I want it to sound crisp.

Police culture:  I saw someone leaving festival and got searched for drugs and this I think is hardcore as they are going home.  I saw someone bringing drugs in and got caught and not sure what happened to him.  Drug sniffer dogs and machine guns I guess makes it safe but I had my balls touched and I'm just going to a rave.

Speed dating event was great idea:  I think we need more community type stuff as part of festival like this where we play games or meet people of other sex or make friends somehow.  It'd be nice if the international folks and spanish folks were integrated better somehow.

Cooling station and cooling food:  I didn't see any ice cream places or frozen smoothie places, etc.  But we need like massive ability to cool down.  I would have eaten like 5 ice creams.  I saw a frozen coffee slushee thing at day festival but we need popsicles and flash freeze our shirts for $5 type of thing.  Misters?  Squirt guns?  We need some way to cool down.

Spanish food cart is needed.  We need one that represents Spain.  Empenadas, soups, postres, olives, tapas, etc.

Mediterranean cart is needed:  Kebabs or indian or lebanese

Discounts to low income or spanish people:  I'd like to see this so that more attend.  If spanish don't attend in large numbers I won't go in future.

The strobes and smoke need more limited application.  Saw daytime ambient artist and had too much strobes.

**Sonar vs. rest of Spain:**

Sonar festival last year inspired me to more deeply check out dance culture in Spain and I did so this vacation.  In Malaga I experienced extremely good vibes with the locals where they were all very helpful and wanted me to meet their friends.  Everyone was talking to me and knew eachother.  Best vibes of all of Spain.  Really enjoyed true club and brunch event.

Valencia culture this year was extremely serious for techno.  Saw chanting and heavy drug use.  Spook club everyone parties in parking lot hours before going inside and its a super sweaty venue.  Reminds me of mini fabrik (from madrid).  Attended 2 other venues and experienced really good house and more closed off vibes.  Wilder more focused serious atmosphere.

Madrid has a famous little venue fabrik and attended last year is raver wonderland.  5 stages with camping on site, it got packed like 2am.  With amount of people there it got super hot  and had vibes in between valencia/malaga.  No international people were there at all.

Granada has a good breaks night but it has very young crowd of 16 year olds. People were friendly and no international people.",1,1750029089.0,SonarFestival,0,1.0,False
1lcdrgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lcdrgj/best_100_i_ever_spent/,Best 100$ I ever spent.,"Many years ago I went on vacation to Jamaica with a girlfriend. We had been dating a little while but it wasn’t going anywhere fast. She was too hooked into her parents and a little nutty. As the stereotype goes, great in bed but a little loopy. 

So on the first night, while at a shitty resort in Montego Bay, a letter was slipped under our door by the manager. 

“Your hotel is over booked, if you’d like to change to a different hotel come to the front desk”

Things couldn’t be any worse so after a chat with the front desk rep and a subtle nod that it won’t be any worse, we agreed to switch. The next morning we were sitting in the front lounge with 4 other people waiting for a bus. 

After a 2 hour bus ride we arrived at the new resort, which was a paradise in comparison, we started really enjoying our vacation. The other 4 on the bus were good people, 2 guys from NY and a couple girls from our town. We kept in touch and hung out periodically during the trip. Couple dinners and a trip to Ricks cafe, a popular tourist spot with cliff diving etc. 

So while at Rick’s, I over hear one of the girls saying how’s she’s run out of money and will hit a local ATM for cash. I hear this and knowing that the ATMs may be shady and over priced I offered to lend her some money till we got back home. My GF wasn’t really impressed but cest la vie. I believe in good karma and helping out a fellow traveller. Didn’t hurt she was cute so… 

Anyway, fast forward a couple weeks and we are home, it’s Easter  weekend and I reach out for the payback. At that point the GF and I had split up and I was dressed nicely for brunch with the ‘rents and we met for a quick coffee and moolah payback. 

We chatted, got my money and parted ways. She looked and smelled very nice and was a sweet person all around. So I sent a quick email 3 mins after she left and basically said “I sensed a little something there and would you like to grab dinner this weekend?”  

I now sit here a happily married father of 2 great kids on Father’s Day in a farm house living the dream. We were barely affected by Covid drama and are plotting a move to a foreign country just for shits and giggles. 

I didn’t know at the time she was an executive for a big company with parents who were more well off than anyone I had ever even met. I at that time was living in a basement apartment working construction.

1lcdr9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoImmuneProtocol/comments/1lcdr9g/the_long_road_ahead/,The long road ahead ….,"Hello, everyone! I am posting this partially to keep myself accountable: I have decided that I would like to start the AIP in July and continue through September! 

A little background: I am a chronically fatigued, neurodivergent girlie who’s been back and forth to Dr’s that can never find the root cause of the issue. A few of my blood tests popped positive for an autoimmune marker a couple years ago, but the rheum couldn’t find anything that caused it. I am hypermobile and I come from a family of bendy, anxious, easily-tired people who all have complicated relationships with food. So I know I’m not crazy. 

I’ve done elimination diets a couple times in my life before, most notably after college when I felt I needed to hardcore detox. I cut out sugar, dairy, alcohol, and gluten for about two weeks. I felt *fantastic* but backslid into my regular diet after finding work at a pizza restaurant. Since then, I’ve done sugar, gluten, alcohol and coffee breaks but never all at once. I find that once I commit, it’s easy to stick to it. But the gearing myself up to it is the problem: the stress of thinking about grocery shopping, worrying about going hungry, being weird at restaurants/parties, etc always stops me before I even get out the door. 

But not this time. Summer always means flareups for me: I react badly to the heat and I eat more sugar/drink more because so many social summer activities revolve around those substances. This summer, I want to feel my best for ME. My life and my health are mine and they’re all I have. I need to start paying them the attention they’re due. However far away this journey takes me from my current life, I know it’s meant to be because it’s where I sit comfortably. I’ve never been high maintenance in my life — I’ve always tried to be easygoing and fun to be around — so I think it’s about time I pulled that card. 

Anyway, like I said, I’m posting this for accountability. I’m going to slowly wean myself off coffee and use up the dairy left in my fridge then it’s AIP world for me. I’ll keep reading this thread and feel supported by all you lovely people taking your health into your own hands. So lovely to meet you all! ",4,1750028977.0,AutoImmuneProtocol,1,0.84,False
