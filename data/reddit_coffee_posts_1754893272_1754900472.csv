1mn7be4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Affiliatemarketing/comments/1mn7be4/took_a_popular_ecommerce_recommendation_model_and/,Took a popular e-commerce recommendation model and applied it to affiliate marketing,"You know how e-commerce sites figure out that “people who buy camping gear also buy portable coffee makers”? That’s called **association rule learning**, and it’s been around for years in retail.

I decided to apply the same logic to affiliate marketing, specifically for **larger programs or networks with at least 15 offers and 20 affiliates**.

Here’s how it works in this context:

If multiple affiliates tend to run *Offer A* **and** *Offer B*, then when another affiliate starts running *Offer A* but not *B*, the system flags *B* as a potential recommendation.

This helps answer questions like:

* What other offers should our affiliates try?
* Which combinations tend to perform well together?
* Are there patterns we’re missing because the data is too big to scan manually?

It’s not a silver bullet and it's only one of the many machine learning models I use, but it’s been surprisingly effective at surfacing cross-sell opportunities inside affiliate programs and networks. It's the kind of insights you’d probably never spot if you’re just using Excel or Google Sheets.

Anyone here has tried applying other machine learning algorithms to affiliate data?",1,1754900377.0,Affiliatemarketing,1,1.0,False
1mn7b05,https://i.redd.it/z158lsxoncif1.jpeg,СТЕНДАП Як я почала заїкатись|Stand-up: How I Started Stuttering,"Було колись, що ви…

Було у вас колись таке: прокидаєшся, п’єш каву…
і розумієш — все, що сьогодні скажеш, буде або неправильно, або з затримкою в 3 секунди.
Я не знаю, чим я ображаю Бога. Але після першої кави в мене зникає вміння… говорити як людина.
Серйозно. До кави я — майбутній лауреат Нобелівки з філології. Після — людина, яка заїкається навіть на слові ""заїкається"".
Ніби тіло зарядилось, а процесор — ні.
Я не завжди заїкалась. Раніше я тільки думала, що говорити небезпечно.
В садочку я казала не “пити”, а “ви не хочете мені дати водички, бо я тут трохи помираю?” Я в 4 роки до всіх людец старші за мене на “Ви” зверталась.
Зараз я виросла — і просто заїкаюсь. Прогрєс!
Мене часто питали: “А ти що, нервуєш?”
Та ні, це я так думаю. З паузами. Глибоко. Художньо.
Просто щоб ви встигли поважати мене до того, як я дійду до суті.
І ще… Знаєте, коли це найнебезпечніше? Коли викладач каже: “Ганна, прокоментуй”.
І поки я починаю: “мммм…ммм…”, він уже: “Так, ясно. Сідайте”.
А я ж просто хотіла блиснути думкою. А вийшло — лише лобом об парту.
Колись одна подруга сказала:
“Ти іноді заїкаєшся так... ніби твоя мова проходить кастинг перед тим, як вийти в етер”.
І справді. Я не кажу одразу — я запускаю бету-версію думки, перевіряю на багаї, і тільки потім — реліз.
""Ганна, яка в тебе думка?""
""ммм...ммммм...ммм...моя думка п-п-поляг-полягає в...ммм...""
""в мовчанні блін”.
Зате дуже зручно!
Якщо не знаєш, що сказати — просто зависай.
Люди думають, ти в роздумах. Ніхто не здогадується, що в голові просто: ""Буфер обміну порожній"".
І от.
Мій викладач. Він той самий тип чоловіка, про якого ти не знаєш — ти його боїшся, поважаєш, чи таємно уявляєш з ним спільний PowerPoint. Він — як антибіотик: потужно, місцями боляче, але загалом ефективно. Ми з ним працювали над темою, яка звучить складніше, ніж моя нервова система.
Я приходжу до нього після безсонної ночі:
> ""П-п-пане, я тут т-т-трохи п-п-підготувала м-м-ммм...""
І він такий:
""Ой. Ти заїкаєшся... Можливо, я тебе трошки перевантажив?""
МОЖЛИВО???
Це як казати: ""Я трохи переоцінюю свої сили"", сидячи на коні, який уже згорів.
І я така:
 “Ні-ні, що ви, я просто ррррр…раціонально дддд…диференціюю.”
А насправді — хочеться лягти під стіл і вдавати ксерокс.
Але наука — то ще пів біди. Побут — ось де мій триллер.
Уявіть: ти в кав’ярні. Кажеш:
""Ммм...м-м-м-м-мммм-макіято, будь ласка.""
Бариста:
“Ой, не хвилюйтесь. У нас не страшно. Все добре.”
А я не хвилююсь! Це просто мій мозок вирішив поігнорити Google Translate, Siri і логіку одночасно!
А ще гірше — знайомства.
Мене питають: “Як тебе звати?”
Я така:
“Г-г-г-г-Ганна.”
І все. Вони думають, я або тікаю від ФБР, або робот.
Знаєте, кажуть: мова — це відображення душі.
А в моєму випадку — відображення внутрішньої паніки. Мені подобається думати, що заїкання — це мій внутрішній цензор. Такий собі строгий редактор, який каже:
 “Стоп. Це звучить тупо. Давай ще раз.”
І поки я переформульовую… всі вже пішли.
Я не лікую заїкання.
Бо, чесно, мені здається, що це частина мого стилю.
Це як шапка у Шерлока — спочатку смішно, потім — чарівно.
І ще: іноді я заїкаюсь — і це допомагає.
Якщо не хочеш відповідати на питання — просто зависни.
Як комп'ютер.
Люди одразу:
 “Окей, окей, все, не пояснюй, ми зрозуміли!”
АПЛОДІСМЄНТИ. І КАВА БО В ПОНЕДІЛОК У ШКОЛУ.

EN:
Have you ever had this?
You wake up, have your coffee…
and realize — everything you say today will be either wrong… or with a 3-second delay.
I don’t know what I did to upset God. But after my first coffee, I lose the ability… to talk like a normal person.
Seriously. Before coffee — I’m a future Nobel Prize winner in Literature.
After coffee — I stutter even on the word “stutter.”
It’s like my body charged up, but my brain didn’t boot yet.
I didn’t always stutter.
Before, I just thought talking was dangerous.
In kindergarten, I didn’t say “water.” I said, “Would you be so kind to give me some water? I’m slowly dying here.”
At 4 years old, I was talking to everyone older than me like they were the Queen.
Now I grew up — and I just stutter. Progress!
People ask me: “Are you nervous?”
No, I just think… with pauses. Deeply. Artistically.
So you have time to respect me before I get to the point.
The most dangerous moment?
When a teacher says: “Georgia, what do you think?”
And while I’m like: “mmm…mmm…mmm…”
They’re already: “Okay, sit down.”
I just wanted to say something smart — but instead, I only hit my head on the desk.
One friend told me:
“You stutter like your words are auditioning before they go on air.”
And it’s true. I don’t speak — I launch a beta version of my thought, check for bugs, and then release it.
“Georgia, what’s your opinion?”
“mmm…mmm…my opinion is…mmm…”
“Okay, so… no opinion.”
But hey — it’s useful!
If you don’t know what to say, just freeze.
People think you’re deep in thought.
They never guess your brain is just showing the spinning loading icon.
Once, I came to my professor after a sleepless night:
> “P-p-professor, I… I prepared m-m-m…”
And he goes:
“Oh, you’re stuttering… Maybe I gave you too much work?”
MAYBE??
That’s like saying, “Maybe I’m overreacting” while your house is already on fire.
And the worst part? Not school — everyday life.
In a coffee shop:
“Can I have a…m-m-m-macchiato, please?”
The barista:
“Oh, don’t worry. You’re safe here.”
I’M NOT WORRIED! My brain just decided to ignore Google Translate, Siri, and logic at the same time!
Dating? Even harder.
Someone asks: “What’s your name?”
I’m like:
“G-g-g-Georgia.”
Now they think I’m either hiding from the FBI… or a robot.
They say speech is a reflection of the soul.
In my case — it’s a reflection of inner panic.
I like to think stuttering is my personal editor.
“Stop. That sounds stupid. Try again.”
And while I’m rewriting… everyone’s already left.
I don’t try to cure it.
I think it’s part of my style.
Like Sherlock’s hat — first it’s funny, then it’s kind of charming.
And sometimes, stuttering helps.
If I don’t want to answer a question — I just freeze. Like a computer.
People go:
“Okay, okay, never mind, we get it!”
APPLAUSE. And coffee. Because Monday means school.

I am willing to do some swapping (e.g. swap the small drawers and table for a bigger chest of drawers for storage) and some minor additions (e.g. small room divider between desk and bed for monitor light) based on suggestions and if they work better in the suggested/current layout.

Important notes: Heights of items are unknown but a list of everything I could find is at the bottom, if that is helpful. The closet is built-in the wall with an inward opening door. There is a radiator across the wall between the closet and the door. The 'tall table' will have a mid-sized TV hooked up to the PC for YouTube in bed.

Please share a free link to this story if you have one!,"The blanket of pure white snow seemed to sparkle in the early morning light. The Pack House was buzzing with excitement about the upcoming festivities. Tomorrow was my birthday, not that anyone cared or even remembered because it was also the birthday of the Thorn Triplets. The Thorn Triplets were the pride and joy of the Winter Moon Pack. They were the sons of Alpha Romeo Thorn. They were filthy rich, devilishly handsome and disgustingly arrogant. All the young she-wolves adored them wholeheartedly and stroked their egos on a daily basis. I was cursed to share a birthday and a home with them.  
  
At the tender age of nine, my parents left the pack to go rogue and had not been seen or heard from since. They left no instructions regarding their wishes for me so I was taken into the pack house under the care of Alpha Romeo and his wife, Ronnie. As if I had not been devastated enough, I now had three twelve-year old tormenters. The identical triplet sons of the Alpha were, in order of birth, Alex, Felix and Calix. They despised me and ensured that I knew I was beneath them. My parents had incurred a huge debt. Thus, I had to earn my keep and repay my debt by doing as many chores as possible while the triplets enjoyed an idyllic childhood in the very same house.   
  
In some packs the new Alpha ascends at age eighteen when they first shift but in mine, the age for ascension was twenty one. Thus tomorrow, on November eleventh, the triplets would turn twenty-one and take over the pack while I would turn eighteen and experience my first shift. Eighteen was also the minimum age when werewolves found their fated mate but I did not care about that. All I wanted was to come of age so I could leave this hell behind.  
  
At least, the pack house had beautiful scenery. We were close to the north pole so snow was an everyday affair though there was no sign of Santa Claus. I certainly did not expect any birthday presents this November or Christmas presents come December. The pack made it clear that I owed them money and they were subtracting everything they did not spend on me from the huge debt. They also subtracted my “wages” from the debt so I was never given any money. I was allowed food, clothes and shelter, the basics.   
  
I slowly got out of bed. The sun was just peeking out from behind a snow-covered horizon. Everything glistened. I gazed out my window at the wintry terrain. I sighed. I had to start making breakfast for everyone. Despite the huge size of the pack house with its luxurious bedrooms and bathrooms, I was given a small empty storage room to stay in. I had a cot, a shelf of second-hand books and a single drawer full of second hand clothes. The other drawers contained extra cleaning supplies as I did the housekeeping work also.   
  
I used the common room’s bathroom, showering quickly. I looked at myself in the mirror. My parents had name me Chasity but everyone in the pack called me Charity. This was started by the triplets as a joke and because they said it so often, even decent pack members thought it was my real name. I was so shy and scared as a child that I never bothered to correct them so it had stuck.   
  
I detangled my waist-length dark blonde curls and put them up in a huge bun. Whenever I left them down the triplets would pull my hair ever since we were little. They had not grown out of this habit even in adulthood. I sighed. There were dark circles forming under my large brown eyes. My light brown skin looked sallow. I had been overworking myself or rather the Thorn family had been overworking me. They used to have a maid and a cook with me as the sole assistant of both, but they had fired them last month after numerous conflicts between them and the spoilt triplets. For the past month, I had been drowning in work while attending my final year of high school. I had seven more months of high school before I could leave this place. That was the deal. At eighteen and after high school, I got my freedom and whatever I had paid off by then would be the end of it. The current Alpha and Luna seemed to think they were being extremely generous.  
  
The pack house had a really good heating system so despite the fact that outside looked like the frigid tundra, inside was pretty warm. I put on a long-sleeved white babydoll top that covered my behind as I was wearing just black leggings underneath.  I started on breakfast. As it was the Triplets’ “birthday week” and they would soon be Alphas, everyday was a feast day. I made waffles, pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs and sausages. I put the butter and maple syrup on the table. I made coffee. I quickly drank some sweet, milky coffee for some energy and started setting the table.  
  
Luna Ronnie entered the dining room, eyeing me, scrutinising my handy-work. She was a tall woman with dark brown long straight hair, pale skin and green eyes.  
  
“The table looks nice,” she said, a rare compliment. “But have you washed all the wares? Wash them all before you eat!”  
  
Alpha Romeo sauntered in, kissing his Luna gently. He nodded in approval at the breakfast spread. I smiled feebly at him. I heard heavy footsteps on the stairs and I took a deep breath. The Triplet Terrors were coming. They towered over me at six feet and four inches each, exactly a foot taller than me. They resembled their father with their shoulder-length thick shiny black hair, chiseled faces, baby blue eyes, dimples and chin-clefts. As they were Alphas they were all broad-shouldered and muscled blessed with super speed and super strength even beyond what was considered extraordinary for a werewolf. They were perfectly identical and perfectly heinous or at least they were to me. Their deep voices boomed as they shouted excitedly, shoving each other playfully. They would be twenty-one tomorrow but they still acted like they were twelve.  
  
Alex was the eldest and the most serious and severe. He would surely rule with an iron fist and a surly demeanour. Felix as the middle triplet loved being the centre of attention and was naturally filled with wise-cracks, jokes and quips. Classic middle child. The youngest, Calix, was the charmer, a professional sweet-talker and Mommy’s favourite. He almost treated me like I was human.  
  
“Did you make all of this, Charity?” Asked Calix, immediately trying to pull my hair out of its bun. I nodded, dodging him, only to bump into Felix who smirked and slipped my hair tie off. My curls tumbled down all around me. Felix and Calix laughed.  
  
“Stop!” I implored them, reaching for my only hair tie. Felix held it high above my head. He threw it to Alex who caught it and put it in his pocket. I tried to lunge towards Alex but Felix grabbed me. Felix and Alex started shoving me back and forth between them like I was a ball and they were playing catch.  
  
“I give up! I give up!” I said while they snickered.  
  
Calix said, “All right. Cut it out. Let her go wash the wares. Mom wants the place kept as clean as possible so there’ll be less to do tomorrow.”  
  
The elder two relinquished me. I ran into the kitchen. My heart was racing. I started on the dishes. By the time I was done, the family of five hungry werewolves, four of them from Alpha stock, had devoured literally everything I made except for one pancake. The chairs were all empty. I went to get the last pancake but Felix snatched it up. He had zoomed in out of nowhere, fast as a cheetah and quiet as a mouse.  
  
“I haven’t eaten anything,” I told him, my eyes wide.  
  
“Good, you’re fat enough as it is,” he said, sneering. He ate the pancake in two bites.  
  
I sighed. I refused to cry. I had not cried in front of them since the first year of torment when I was nine. My tenth birthday marked a very important vow I had made to myself after crying almost every single day at aged nine. The vow was that I would never let the Triplets make me cry ever again. I would be strong. I had kept that vow successfully for eight years come tomorrow. The comment stung though. The Triplets were widely regarded as the most handsome eligible bachelors in the Pack. They constantly attacked my weight. I was not overweight but I had a curvy hourglass figure. My waist was slender. I wore about a size 4 in clothes which was small enough in my opinion but all the Triplets had stick-thin size 0 girlfriends.  
  
I had to take the bus to school. I had thrown on a man’s black coat over my white top and leggings, another hand-me-down. I managed to find another hair tie but this was truly the last one. The Pack high school was called Winter Moon High after the pack. Our pack colours, and therefore also the school colours, were white, blue and silver. The whole school was decorated with streamers and balloons in celebration of the new Alphas, the Triplets.  
  
“You’re so lucky, Charity,” said Mina Toros, the most popular girl in my senior year. She tossed her long dark hair back and pursed her plump red lips in her locker’s inside mirror. She was wearing a pink skirt short enough to qualify as belt. Thank goodness she had opaque tights on underneath. She usually ignored me except for the occasional pronouncement of how “lucky” I was.  
  
“The things I’d to those Triplets if I lived in that house,” Mina said, licking her lips.  
  
“You’d have to drop out!” Squealed her best friend, the second most popular girl, Tina Gregory. “You’d get pregnant the first month there.”  
  
Tina had flawless dark brown skin with curly hair. She was tall and waif-like and also wore a pink skirt short enough to be a belt with opaque tights. Mina and Tina usually matched as though they were twins. Mina cackled at Tina’s joke.  
  
“You know, Charity,” said Mina suddenly. “You’re not totally hideous.”  
  
Gee, thanks.  
  
“Ok,” I said, clutching my books. The girls were blocking my locker which was sandwiched between their two lockers. Lucky me, indeed.  
  
“Yeah,” agreed Tina. “Your hair is actually pretty. You’re like a biracial Goldie Locks.”  
  
I smiled. That sounded like a real compliment.  
  
“Thanks Tina!” I said.  
  
“Ohhh! And those Triplets are the three bears!” Shrieked Mina. “If I were their Goldie Locks I’d make sure everything was just right, get it?”  
  
“Or too big,” said Tina, giggling.  
  
“That means one of the triplets has to be too small,” I said softly.  
  
Being werewolves, Mina and Tina heard me and they burst out laughing. Wow. I was actually getting along with them for five minutes.  
  
“That was a good one, Charity, surprising,” said Tina, looking at me like she was now seeing me for the first time.  
  
“Yeah,” said Mina giving me the same strange appraising look. “You know, if you had the money, imagine how cute you could look.”  
  
I fidgeted uncomfortably, suddenly hyperaware of the patches in my clothes. Mina and Tina strutted off and I hurriedly opened my locker and got out my Math book. Mr Johnson who coached football and taught Math looked like he should be an Alpha too. He was huge and really attractive for a teacher. He was married though to his mate, the Art teacher, Mrs Johnson. He handed out our graded tests while Tina and Mina made flirty faces at him. Those flirty faces were not doing them any good. I noticed they got an F and an F minus respectively. I did not know F minus existed before today. He smiled at me and winked. My heart skipped a beat. “A plus as usual Math champ,” he boomed. Mr Johnson was one of the few people in my life who was nice to me.   
  
“Mina and Tina, see me after class,” Mr Johnson said.  
  
After class, Ashton Peters, a tall buff redhead who played football and was well-liked in the pack, pretended to knock into my desk.The stack of papers on my desk went flying all over the room. Mr Johnson spotted it.  
  
“Stay and help her pick those up, Aston, my boy,” boomed Mr Johnson.  
  
“Aww, coach, I’ll be late for football practice,” he whined.  
  
“And we’ll be late for cheerleading practice,” said Mina and Tina in unison, pouting.  
  
“I’m the coach, Aston, go ahead and be late. I’ll explain to your cheerleading coach ok, girls,” said Mr Johnson.  
  
Ashton grumbled. He glared at me as if this were my fault. He started picking up papers at werewolf speed which cause the ones I was picking up to fly around due to the displaced wind. I eavesdropped on the meeting with Mina and Tina.  
  
“Mina, Tina, I’m giving you a homework assignment to make up those grades. If you don’t ace it there won’t be any cheerleading,” he said.  
  
The girls gasped. He handed them a stack of papers each and told them they could work on it together and that he set the questions himself so they would not find the answers online. I snatched up the last few papers from the floor and took the stack Ashton was handing me without looking at me.   
  
“Thanks,” I said softly to him.  
  
He glanced down at me, surprised by my thanks. He looked a little guilty all of a sudden. Mr Johnson left the room, leaving Mina and Tina  looking dejected. Ashton grabbed the hair tie from my hair just like Calix had this morning. My curls came tumbling down again. I shrieked. I was so fed up. Ashton laughed and ran away to football practice. There went my last hair tie and my birthday was tomorrow.  
  
“Aren’t you going to cheerleading?” I asked the girls, actually feeling sorry for them as they had been sort of nice earlier.  
  
“No,” said Mina.  
  
“What’s the use. We’ll never ace this homework so we’ll fail the class and be banned from the squad anyway,” explained Tina.  
  
I walked up to them and looked at the homework assignment. I snorted. I could get 100% in this in my sleep. I was suddenly struck by an idea.  
  
“Remember how you girls said I had…potential,” I said, looking at them.  
  
They shrugged.  
  
“I’ll do the assignment and you copy it over in your handwritings and ace it ok,” I offered.  
  
The girls squealed. They jumped up hugging each other and me.  
  
“Wait!” Said Mina, raising her eyebrows.  
  
“What’s the catch?” Asked Tina, narrowing her eyes.  
  
“I’m turning eighteen tomorrow too,” I said.  
  
They gasped.  
  
“You have the same birthday as the triplets?” Mina asked.  
  
“Wait that means everyone ignores your birthday like every single year,” said Tina.  
  
It was my turn to shrug.  
  
“And they will this year too but I at least wanna feel…special. I’m gonna shift for the first time at midnight and who knows…I might see my mate at the big party…not that I care…” I rambled.  
  
“You wanna look hot! Is that it?” Mina said smirking.  
  
“Yeah you want us to make you over?” Tina asked, smiling.  
  
I nodded.   
  


# Chapter 2: Makeover!

2322 WordsChapter 2: Makeover!  
  
I was supposed to go home immediately after school to help with the preparations for the huge birthday party tomorrow night for the Triplets but I had to do the assignment for the girls and they had to make me over. I knew I would pay for it later but whatever. The Thorns had hired a party planner. They should be okay for a few hours without their werewolf Cinderella.  
  
I did the assignment for the girls literally in the car on the way to the mall. It was that easy. Math was my thing. I was a nerd in general and I was proud of this even though werewolves prized brawn and beauty over brains any day.  
  
The girls were impressed. They quickly copied it over sitting in the freezing car parking lot with the heater turned up. Mina drove a sports car. I did not know what kind but I knew that Mina and Tina were almost as rich as the Alpha and his family. They dragged me into the mall, squealing excitedly as though I was doing them a favour even when it came to the makeover. I reminded them I had no money. They rolled their eyes and ignored me. I guessed I could consider the stuff they bought as part of the deal.   
  
I tried on outfit after outfit. Mina and Tina rated each one and seemed to having a blast. This was actually kind of fun. They encouraged me to pick out a lot of miniskirts and mini dresses. They said I had “great legs” even though the Triplets called me fat. Honestly, the clothes they picked for me did look great. I had some trouble walking in heels but the girls made me practice in the store like it was a runway. They pretended to be on a catwalk too. They were so confident. I had to marvel at them. Next they showed me what makeup to wear and how to style my hair at Tina’s house. They did a test run. I looked in Tina’s floor-length mirror and my jaw dropped.  
  
I had on high heeled black ankle boots with a mini pleated black skirt. I was wearing black stockings as it was cold out even for a werewolf. My long-sleeved white top had a sweetheart neckline that was really flattering. My hair was so shiny in loose bouncy curls down my back. My skin glowed and I had cat eyeliner and red lips that surprisingly suited me. I hugged Mina and Tina. Did I just make two friends?  
  
They drove me to the pack house hoping to catch a glimpse of the triplets but they were not at home yet. Thank goodness! I started helping the party planner sort out all the decorations and the food. It was tomorrow night but there was a lot to do. I did my own homework in between all of this. I was a master multitasker. I heard three cars parking. It was the triplets. Alpha and Luna were out shopping for even more gifts despite the fact that I had already wrapped like a dozen gifts. The party planner was a bleached blonde in her thirties who was obsessed with the hunk-i-ness of the triplets. She seemed to dislike me even though I was the only one helping her. She had been over everyday this week and always tried to make me look bad in front of the triplets. I wanted to tell her that they already hated me so she could relax. Her name was Ronda Something. I kept forgetting her last name.  
  
The triplets walked in. Each had their arm around a girl. They had different girlfriends every two months or so. It did not make sense learning the girls’ names. Also, the triplets were anxious to find their real mate. They were not sure if they had three separate mates or just one mate to share. Sounds crazy but when it came to identical multiples like twins and triplets, they usually shared a single mate since they had been one egg and one sperm that split to form the multiples. So theoretically identical twins and triplets were naturally occurring clones. Every girl wished she was their mate. That was so crazy to me. The triplets were handsome but they were awful and three mates sounded so complicated.  
  
Ronda glared at their girlfriends, jealousy evident in her beady eyes. The girls did not stay long and when they left, Ronda told the triplets I had showed up really late to help her. I sighed. I had been under the table literally as I wrapped tiny presents for door prizes. All the pack members got to pick a mystery present from a huge box tomorrow.   
  
I crawled out from under the table to make myself known before they had to look for me. Hiding from them would just set them off. The triplets stared at me, their eyes wide. They looked at each other. I remembered my makeover. I did not think they would notice or even care. Alex licked his lips, trailing his eyes from my head to my toes. I took a step back. Felix looked flabbergasted and Calix smirked at me.  
  
“Leave it to us, Ronda,” said Felix, recovering his usual haughty sneer, “We’ll punish her.”  
  
Ronda smiled maliciously at me. She was the most immature adult I had ever met including the triplets and that was saying something. The triplets had me backed against the kitchen island.  
  
“I’m sorry,” I said, “I had to do some extra math for Mr Johnson.”  
  
It was not a complete lie. The triplets knew Mr Johnson because they were his football stars back when they went to High school. They also knew I had won Math competitions before. They had really enjoyed making fun of me then.  
  
“Ok,” said Felix simply. He took a step towards me. “What’s all of this?” He gestured to my outfit, makeup and hair.  
  
“My eighteenth birthday is tomorrow too. I’m just trying out how I wanna look,” I said, looking down, waiting for them to insult me or call me fat.  
  
“Do you have a boyfriend, is that it?” Asked Alex, anger rising in his voice.  
  
Why did he even care?  
  
“I’m too fat to get a boyfriend, remember?” I said, repeating one of their classic insults.  
  
“Don’t play games with us,” said Felix softly. “Is all of this for your mate? Have you figured out who he is?”  
  
“No!” I said. They were acting so strange like I had done something underhanded.  
  
“You’ll only know for sure tomorrow. Your inner wolf will tell you who your mate is,” said Calix.  
  
“I don’t want a mate,” I said honestly. I had never had a guy be nice to me and I could not picture it happening.  
  
“Why the hell not?” Alex asked like I was crazy for saying that. The Triplets were eager to find their real mate. They talked about it every birthday. They would visit other packs hoping to get a whiff of their mate. They thought maybe their mate was younger than them. That would explain why they could not pick up her scent. Only mates who had come of age could be discovered.  
  
“Because he’d just be mean to me and call me names and I get enough of that from you,” I snapped. I should not have snapped. I was a little frightened now. The triplets had not hit me since we were little. The last fight happened when I was eleven and they were fourteen. I had punched Calix, breaking his nose for calling me “fat and nasty” with “dead parents”. My parents whereabouts had never been confirmed and I always liked to think they were alive. After he had let out a blood-curdling scream and told his elder brothers about his nose, Alex slapped me and then Felix slapped me. Calix had been reluctant but they made him hit me. They dragged me out to the frozen river behind the pack house. There was a hole in it for fishing. I was small enough to dip in the hole. They had held me under the water until I blacked out. Their parents had been furious. I went to the hospital for hypothermia. I never knew what their punishments had been but after that we never got physical with each other, nothing more than a shove.  
  
“Are you stupid?” Asked Alex.  
  
I shrugged.  
  
“No werewolf would insult his own mate or be mean to her,” said Felix, rolling his eyes.  
  
“Don’t you know anything?” Added Calix.  
  
“Ok, thanks, I get it now,” I said simply.  
  
“You dressed up for us, didn’t you?” Said Felix smirking and rubbing his chin. The other two grinned. My heart leapt a little at the sight of their dimples. I shook my head. What was wrong with me? The triplets were monsters and good looks did not absolve them of that.  
  
“Don’t make her admit it,” said Calix. “She’s embarrassed, Felix.”  
  
“Admit it! You did this for us!” Felix exclaimed, grinning wickedly. He kept coming closer and my back was pressed against the kitchen island now.  
  
Alex was quiet, smiling faintly and watching me closely. I just wanted them to go away. I was so frustrated with my whole life. There would not be a single present for me tomorrow. No one had counselled me about my shift at midnight and I was scared. I knew it would be painful and I did not need this from these three privileged assholes who did not deserve the title of Alpha. They were physically Alphas but they had no integrity. They could not lead this pack. What a joke! I decided to play along.  
  
“Yeah, ok,” I said softly, looking down to feign embarrassment and hugging myself tightly. “I dressed up for you. I asked two girls at school to help me. I really did have a math thing but I went to get dolled up after so that made me late as well. I’m sorry.”  
  
I hid my face in my hands, stifling my laughter. They seemed to think I was crying.  
  
“Hey, you know, we aren’t the stupid little boys we used to be when we would fight with you,” said Alex gently. “We’re taking over this pack tomorrow and as you’re part of this pack we just wanna know what’s going on with you that’s all.”  
  
Huh?  
  
“Don’t cry, stupid,” said Felix exasperadteay.  
  
“Don’t insult her when you’re trying to cheer her up, stupid,” said Calix, turning on Felix. “Chasity,” said Calix, using my real name for the first time in nine years.  
  
I dropped my hands. I was shocked. I just stared at him.  
  
“You look pretty, ok” said Calix, winking.   
  
My heart skipped a beat. He was bending down. His face was really close to me.  
  
“Thanks for dressing up for us. I hope you wear an even shorter skirt tomorrow,” he said softly, smirking.  
  
I rolled my eyes. Alex and Felix burst into laughter. I tried to brush past them but Felix grabbed my arms and put my back against the island again. My breath hitched in my throat.  
  
“Did I say you could leave?” He asked, his nose brushing against my nose as he bent towards me. I squirmed in his arms.  
  
“You need to have respect for your Alphas, Charity,” Alex said, using my awful nickname. The spell that Calix had cast on me was broken.  
  
“Damn it!” I screamed. “Let me go! Three Alpha males against one omega female is insane. You have no honour,” I cried, struggling against Felix. He released me.  
  
“We were just playing with you Charity!” Said Felix “Good grief! Go! Run upstairs!”  
  
I ran upstairs and to my room. I locked the door. I sat on my cot, hugging my knees to my chest. The Alpha and Luna came knocking on my door when darkness fell. I went out to them.  
  
“We almost forgot, you have your first shift at midnight, same birthday as the triplets,” said Alpha Romeo rubbing the back of his neck.  
  
I smiled. Were they going to counsel me or give me a gift?  
  
“Yeah, so make sure and be out of the house at least by 11:45pm so you don’t break anything or make any mess when you shift,” said Luna Ronnie.  
  
I nodded. I supposed that was one piece of advice. I left the house at half past eleven wearing my old clothes. I crunched through the snow. It was pitch-black. I sighed. I was nervous. I was scared of the pain. I wished my parents could be here. For the first nine years old my life, they had been in and out of rehabs. They were inconsistent but they actually seemed to love me a lot. They would always make my birthdays and holidays special no matter how high they were. They were deeply in love with each other as mates and back then I almost looked forward to having a mate of my own. It was almost midnight. I did not want to rip my clothes so I removed them and stood in the snow naked and barefoot my curls covering me to my waist. If I had not been a werewolf I would have frozen to death.  
  
Midnight came and I felt my bones breaking.

Chapter 3: Shift and Sniff and Squirt  
  
The pain shot through me. It was excruciating. I screamed. My bones lengthened and rearranged themselves. Sandy-coloured fur enveloped my form. My eyesight and hearing became so sharp. I stood on all fours. I howled. I was a wolf. I ran through the night, white snow beneath me and black sky above me. I practically flew. When I had tired of running. They would probably so cold after lying in the snow. I focused on what I looked like human and my bones started breaking again. It was painful but not nearly as bad as the first time. The triplets had gone out to ring in the first few minutes of their twenty-first birthday with some of their friends at a bar.   
  
I passed by their rooms. The house had three floors. The Alpha and Luna slept on the top floor. The Triplets and I slept on the middle floor. I had a tiny converted storage room and each triplet had a master bedroom and bathroom. There was the most delicious smell coming from Calix’s room. I snuck in. He was the least scary of the triplets so I did not mind if he caught my scent when he came home and realised I had been in his home. His room literally smelled like freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. I looked around. Maybe he had pot cookies or something. I did not find anything. Ugh. I had put my scent all over some of his stuff for nothing.  
  
I walked out and caught another scrumptious scent. This one was coming from the middle master bedroom that belonged to Felix. I dared not go in there but I sniffed the doorway. The smell reminded me of sweet coconut shavings. There was a tropical edge to it. I breathed it in, wondering why I had never picked it up before. My heart started to race. I was afraid to go near Alex’s room but I had to know. If all three rooms suddenly smelled great to me then…  
  
I refused to think about it. I walked over to Alex’s door. I picked up the scent. The strong smell of coffee and cocoa hit me. My mouth watered a little. Did Alex smell that good? The window blew open suddenly and all three scents wafted down the hallway. Their combined scents hit me. I was in big trouble. I went to my tiny room and locked the door. I tried to fall asleep but I kept tossing and turning. Those scents were plaguing me. Would they smell me when they returned home? Would I suddenly smell different now to them? I did not want to analyse it too much. Maybe my enhanced sense of smell was just picking up a lot that I had not noticed before. Maybe everyone smelled this good.  
  
Third Person  
  
Calix, Felix and Alex sauntered in the house at around three in the morning. It was Saturday. Later tonight, they had their official birthday party and alpha ceremony. Celebrating with their girlfriends and their “bros” from the town had left them exhausted and a little tipsy. It was difficult for werewolves to get drunk no matter how much alcohol they had but the triplets had really done their best. They said good night and happy birthday to each other and parted ways.  
  
Calix stumbled into his room. A familiar scent greeted him but there was some unmistakable new element to it like a new ingredient enhancing an old favourite recipe of his. Someone had been in his room. A girl. She smelled like roses and honeysuckle. He shivered. That scent was driving him crazy. He could not sleep. It was all over everything. He felt as if he recognised the smell but he could not say exactly who it was. Surely he would have noticed and remembered someone who smelled this good.  
  
He could not take it anymore when the sun came up. He banged on his brothers’ doors. They greeted him still half-asleep.  
  
“What’s wrong, little bro?” Asked Alex, concern evident on his face.  
  
“It better be good. It’s six o’ clock in the morning. We partied last night and we’re partying tonight,” said Felix, doing a little dance and yawning.  
  
“Smell my room,” said Calix.  
  
His brothers laughed. He walked away from them. They followed him.  
  
“Enough!” Said Felix storming into Calix’s room. Felix stopped in his tracks. Alex entered and his eyes widened.  
  
“Oh my God,” said Felix. “What is that?” The Alpha started sniffing about his brother’s room.  
  
“Little Bro, who was in your room?” Asked Alex sharply.  
  
“You’ve been with our mate!” Said Felix, growling. “You’re keeping her all to yourself.”  
  
“No, I don’t know whose scent it is and it’s driving me crazy,” said Calix with tired eyes.  
  
“Our mate’s been in this room,” said Felix gleefully. “She found us! Oh I can’t wait to get on her.” Felix growled again.  
  
“What about Sandra, Tonya and Avery?” Asked Calix, mentioning their current girlfriends.  
  
“We’ve only been dating them like a couple weeks! They know they’re not our mates so it was a temporary thing! I’m gonna end it with Tonya over the phone,” said Felix dismissively.  
  
“Yeah,” agreed Alex. “If we can find our mate in time for the party we don’t want the girls showing up and harassing her.”  
  
“Yeah, they’d be jealous,” said Calix. “And there’s one of her and three of them so we better tell them before tonight.”  
  
The brothers were in agreement, all sitting on Calix’s bed.  
  
“Who would be in my room?” Calix wondered.  
  
“There’s something familiar about the smell,” said Alex, smiling. “It kinda smells a little like…” Alex paused, frowning. He got up and ran down the hallway. He stood in front of the door to Chasity’s little makeshift room. The same smell hit him. It made him shiver. Honeysuckle and Roses. He sighed. He found her door unlocked and opened it eagerly to reveal an empty room with the cot in the corner made. His face fell.  
  
It suddenly dawned on him just how small Chasity’s room was compared to the other bedrooms in the house. There were empty guest bedrooms bigger than this room. Why didn’t his parents give her one of those?  
  
His brothers came up behind him. Felix looked dumbfounded. Calix walked into Chasity’s room and lay in her cot, deeply inhaling her scent.  
  
“I’m gonna wait for her to come back, right here,” he said, curling up on her tiny cot. It was comically small for the six-foot-four Alpha.  
  
“I wanna go get her right now,” said Felix, his eyes worried. “We have a lot of talking to do.”  
  
“Relax, Felix,” said Alex. “Our mate already lives with us so we’re good,” said the eldest Alpha grinning.  
  
“No, we’re not good!” Said Felix staring at them. “Our mate is Charity. Charity!”  
  
“Don’t call her that!” Snarled Calix, his blue eyes turning black.  
  
“Sorry! Sorry! It’s a bad habit. Chasity,” Felix said. Her real name felt good to say out loud.  
  
“What’s your problem?” Asked Alex. He was looking through Chasity’s things, thinking of all the stuff he was going to buy her. She hardly had anything so she would be easy to surprise. It was her birthday too after all.  
  
“We have to go to the mall as soon as it opens at ten,” he told his younger brothers. “It’s Chasity’s birthday too and I’m sure Mom and Dad didn’t get her anything.”  
  
“Are you hearing yourself?” Asked Felix.  
  
“Again! What is your problem?” Alex asked Felix. Calix opened his eyes to glare at Felix.  
  
“Chasity is our mate! We had no idea because she was not of age until today!” Felix said, waving his arms around like a mad man.  
  
Calix and Alex were not following.  
  
“We’ve treated Chasity bad! When she realises she’s our mate, she’s going to reject us!” Said Felix.  
  
Calix shot up into a sitting position. “No, she’s not,” the youngest said. “No, she can’t. We’ve been waiting three years for our mate.”  
  
“Chasity said she didn’t want a mate, remember?” Said Felix, spelling it out for them.  
  
“Yeah,” said Alex. “But when the mate bond actually hits her, she’ll be putty in our hands.”  
  
Calix beamed, grinning at Alex. “Yep,” Calix agreed.  
  
Felix rolled his eyes. “Do you remember why Chasity did not want a mate? She said because he’d be mean to her like we were. Her mate is literally us.”  
  
Calix and Alex were starting to look worried.  
  
“She’s going to freak out!” Said Felix. “She’s going to try to leave. Remember, she’s been talking about turning eighteen, finishing high school and leaving!”  
  
Alex smirked. “She has seven more months of high school. It’s November. We have until June or July with her to convince her otherwise.”  
  
Felix calmed down a little, thinking it over.  
  
Calix grinned wickedly, his dimples showing, mischief in his baby blue eyes, “Chasity might hate us now but by next summer we’ll be making her submit.”

  So she tells me, the words dribbling out with the cranberry muffin crumbs, commas dunked in her coffee.  
  
  She tells me in four sentences. No, five.  
  
  I can’t let me hear this, but it’s too late. The facts sneak in and stab me. When she gets to the worst part  
  
  ... body found in a motel room, alone . . .  
  
  ... my walls go up and my doors lock. I nod like I’m listening, like we’re communicating, and she never knows the difference.  
  
  It’s not nice when girls die.  
  
  002.00  
  
  “We didn’t want you hearing it at school or on the news.” Jennifer crams the last hunk of muffin into her mouth. “Are you sure you’re okay?”  
  
  I open the dishwasher and lean into the cloud of steam that floats out of it. I wish I could crawl in and curl up between a bowl and a plate.Jennifer could lock the door, twist the dial to SCALD, and press ON.  
  
  The steam freezes when it touches my face. “I’m fine,” I lie.  
  
  She reaches for the box of oatmeal raisin cookies on the table. “This must feel awful.” She rips off the cardboard ribbon. “Worse than awful. Can you get me a clean container?”  
  
  I take a clear plastic box and lid out of the cupboard and hand it across the island to her. “Where’s Dad?”  
  
  “He had a tenure meeting.”  
  
  “Who told you about Cassie?”  
  
  She crumbles the edges of the cookies before she puts them in the box, to make it look like she baked instead of bought. “Your mother called late last night with the news. She wants you to see Dr. Parker right away instead of waiting for your next appointment.”  
  
  “What do you think?” I ask.  
  
  “It’s a good idea,” she says. “I’ll see if she can fit you in this afternoon.”  
  
  “Don’t bother.” I pull out the top rack of the dishwasher. The glasses vibrate with little screams when I touch them. If I pick them up, they’ll shatter. “There’s no point.”  
  
  She pauses in mid-crumble. “Cassie was your best friend.”  
  
  “Not anymore. I’ll see Dr. Parker next week like I’m supposed to.”  
  
  “I guess it’s your decision. Will you promise me you’ll call your mom and talk to her about it?”  
  
  “Promise.”  
  
  Jennifer looks at the clock on the microwave and shouts, “Emma—four minutes!”  
  
  Emma doesn’t answer. She’s in the family room, hypnotized by the television and a bowl of blue cereal.  
  
  Jennifer nibbles a cookie. “I hate to speak ill of the dead, but I’m glad you didn’t hang out with her anymore.”  
  
  I push the top rack back in and pull out the bottom. “Why?”  
  
  “Cassie was a mess. She could have taken you down with her.”  
  
  I reach for the steak knife hiding in the nest of spoons. The black handle is warm. As I pull it free, the blade slices the air, dividing the kitchen into slivers. There is Jennifer, packing store-bought cookies in a plastic tub for her daughter’s class. There is Dad’s empty chair, pretending he has no choice about these early meetings. There is the shadow of my mother, who prefers the phone because face-to-face takes too much time and usually ends in screaming.  
  
  Here stands a girl clutching a knife. There is grease on the stove, blood in the air, and angry words piled in the corners. We are trained not to see it, not to see any of it.  
  
  ... body found in a motel room, alone . . .  
  
  Someone just ripped off my eyelids.  
  
  “Thank God you’re stronger t  
han she was.” Jennifer drains her coffee mug and wipes the crumbs from the corners of her mouth.  
  
  The knife slides into the butcher block with a whisper. “Yeah.” I reach for a plate, scrubbed free of blood and gristle. It weighs ten pounds.  
  
  She snaps the lid on the box of cookies. “I have a late settlement appointment. Can you take Emma to soccer? Practice starts at five.”  
  
  “Which field?”  
  
  “Richland Park, out past the mall. Here.” She hands the heavy mug to me, her lipstick a bloody crescent on the rim. I set it on the counter and unload the plates one at a time, arms shaking.  
  
  Emma comes into the kitchen and sets her cereal bowl, half-filled with sky-colored milk, next to the sink.  
  
  “Did you remember the cookies?” she asks her mother.  
  
  Jennifer shakes the plastic container. “We’re late, honey. Get your stuff.”  
  
  Emma trudges toward her backpack, her sneaker laces flopping. She should still be sleeping, but my father’s wife drives her to school early four mornings a week for violin lessons and conversational French. Third grade is not too young for enrichment, you know.  
  
  Jennifer stands up. The fabric of her skirt is pulled so tight over her thighs, the pockets gape open. She tries to smooth out the wrinkles. “Don’t let Emma con you into buying chips before practice. If she’s hungry, she can have a fruit cup.”  
  
  “Should I stick around and drive her home?”  
  
  She shakes her head. “The Grants will do it.” She takes her coat off the back of the chair, puts her arms in the sleeves, and starts to button up. “Why don’t you have one of the muffins? I bought oranges yesterday, or you could have toast or frozen waffles.”  
  
  because I don’t need a muffin (410), I don’t want an orange (75) or toast (87), and waffles (180) make me gag.  
  
  I point to the empty bowl on the counter, next to the huddle of pill bottles and the Bluberridazzlepops box. “I’m having cereal.”  
  
  Her eyes dart to the cabinet where she had taped up my meal plan. It came with the discharge papers when I moved in six months ago. I took it down three months later, on my eighteenth birthday.  
  
  “That’s too small to be a full serving,” she says carefully.  
  
  I probably won’t even fill the bowl. “My stomach’s upset.”  
  
  She opens her mouth again. Hesitates. A sour puff of coffee-stained morning breath blows across the still kitchen and splashes into me. Don’t say it—don’tsayit.  
  
  “Trust, Lia.”  
  
  She said it.  
  
  “That’s the issue. Especially now. We don’t want . . .”  
  
  If I weren’t so tired, I’d shove trust and issue down the garbage disposal and let it run all day.  
  
  I pull a bigger bowl out of the dishwasher and put it on the counter. “I. Am. Fine. Okay?”  
  
  She blinks twice and finishes buttoning her coat. “Okay. I understand. Tie your sneakers, Emma, and get in the car.”  
  
  Emma yawns.  
  
  “Hang on.” I bend down and tie Emma’s laces. Double-knotted. I look up. “I can’t keep doing this, you know. You’re way too old.”  
  
  She grins and kisses my forehead. “Yes you can, silly.”  
  
  As I stand up, Jennifer takes two awkward steps toward me. I wait. She is a pale, round moth, dusted with eggshell foundation, armed for the day with her banker’s briefcase, purse, and remote starter for the leased SUV. She flutters, nervous.  
  
  I wait.  
  
  This is where we should hug or kiss or pretend to.  
  
  She ties the belt around her middle. “Look . . . just keep moving today. Okay? Try not to think about things too much.”  
  
  “Right.”  
  
  “Say good-bye to your sister, Emma,” Jennifer prompts.  
  
  “Bye, Lia.” Emma waves and gives me a small berridazzle smile. “The cereal is really good. You can finish the box if you want.”  
  
  003.00  
  
  I pour too much cereal (150) in the bowl, splash on the two-percent milk (125). Breakfast is themostimportantmealoftheday. Breakfast will make me a cham-pee-on.  
  
  ... When I was a real girl, with two parents and one house and no blades flashing, breakfast was granola topped with fresh strawberries, always eaten while reading a book propped up on the fruit bowl. At Cassie’s house we’d eat waffles with thin syrup that came from maple trees, not the fake corn syrup stuff, and we’d read the funny pages. . . .  
  
  No. I can’t go there. I won’t think. I won’t look.  
  
  I won’t pollute my insides with Bluberridazzlepops or muffins or scritchscratchy shards of toast, either. Yesterday’s dirt and mistakes have moved through me. I am shiny and pink inside, clean. Empty is good. Empty is strong.  
  
  But I have to drive.  
  
  . . . I drove last year, windows down, music cranked, first Saturday in October, flying to the SATs. I drove so Cassie could put the top coat on her nails. We were secret sisters with a plan for world domination, potential bubbling around us like champagne. Cassie laughed. I laughed. We were perfection.  
  
  Did I eat breakfast? Of course not. Did I eat dinner the night before, or lunch, or anything?  
  
  The car in front of us braked as the traffic light turned yellow, then red. My flip-flop hovered above the pedal. My edges blurred. Black squiggle tingles curled up my spine and wrapped around my eyes like a silk scarf. The car in front of us disappeared. The steering wheel, the dashboard, vanished. There was no Cassie, no traffic light. How was I supposed to stop this thing?  
  
  Cassie screamed in slow motion.  
  
  ::Marshmallow/air/explosion/bag::  
  
  When I woke up, the emt-person and a cop were frowning. The driver whose car I smashed into was screaming into his cell phone.  
  
  My blood pressure was that of a cold snake. My heart was tired. My lungs wanted a nap. They stuck me with a needle, inflated me like a state-fair balloon, and shipped me off to a hospital with steel-eyed nurses who wrote down every bad number. In pen. Busted me.  
  
  Mom and Dad rushed in, side by side for a change, happy that I was not dead. A nurse handed my chart to my mother. She read through it and explained the disaster to my father and then they fought, a mudslide of an argument that spewed across the antiseptic sheets and out into the hall. I was stressed/overscheduled/manic/ no—depressed/no—in need of attention/no—in need of discipline/in need of rest/in need/your fault/your fault/ fault/fault. They branded their war on this tiny skin-bag of a girl.  
  
  Phone calls were made. My parents force-marched me intoNew Seasons. . . .  
  
  Cassie escaped, as usual. Not a scratch. Insurance more than covered the damage, so she wound up with a fixed car and new speakers. Our mothers had a little talk, but really all girls go through these things and what are you going to do? Cassie rescheduled for the next test and got her nails done at a salon, Enchanted Blue, while they locked me up and dripped sugar water into my empty veins. . . .  
  
  Lesson learned. Driving requires fuel.  
  
  Not Emma’s Bluberridazzlepop cereal. I shiver and pour most of the soggy mess down the disposal, then set the bowl on the floor. Emma’s cats, Kora and Pluto, pad across the kitchen and stick their heads in the bowl. I draw a cartoon face with a big tongue on a sticky note, write YUMMY, EMMA! THANKS! and slap it on the cereal box.  
  
  I eat ten raisins (16) and five almonds (35) and a green-bellied pear (121) (= 172). The bites crawl down my throat. I eat my vitamins and the crazy seeds that keep my brain from exploding: one long purple, one fat white, two poppy-red. I wash everybody down with hot water.  
  
  They better work quick. The voice of a dead girl is waiting for me on my phone.  
  
  004.00  
  
  The climb upstairs takes longer than usual.  
  
  I sleep at the far end of the hall, in the tiny space still decorated like a guest room. White walls. Yellow curtains. The sofa bed is never folded up, the desk came from a yard sale. Jennifer keeps offering to buy me new furniture, and paint or put up wallpaper. I tell her I haven’t figured out what I want to do yet. I should probably unpack the stacks of dusty boxes first.  
  
  My phone is waiting o  
n top of the pile of dirty clothes, right where it landed when I chucked it at the wall early Sunday morning because the constant ringing was making me crazy and I was too tired to turn it off.  
  
  . . . The last time she called me was six months ago, after I got out of the hospital for the second time. I’d been calling her four or five times a day, but she wouldn’t pick up or call me back, until finally, she did.  
  
  She asked me to listen and told me this wouldn’t take long.  
  
  I was the root of all evil, Cassie said. A negative influence, a toxic shadow. While I was locked up, her parents had dragged her to a doctor who washed her brain and weighed her down with pills and empty words. She needed to move on with her life, redefine her boundaries, she said. I was the reason she cut classes and failed French, the cause of everything nasty and dangerous.  
  
  Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.  
  
  I was the reason she didn’t run away freshman year. I was the reason she didn’t eat a bottle of sleeping pills when her boyfriend cheated on her. I listened for hours when her parents yelled and tried to stuff her into a mannequin shell that didn’t fit. I understood what triggered her earthquakes, most of them. I knew how much it hurt to be the daughter of people who can’t see you, not even if you are standing in front of them stomping your feet.  
  
  But remembering all that was too complicated for Cassie. It was easier for her to dump me one last time. She turned my summer into a desert wasteland. When school started, she looked right through me in the halls, her new friends draped around her neck like Mardi Gras necklaces. She wiped me off the face of her existence.  
  
  But something happened. In the dead time between Saturday night and Sunday morning, she called me.

Of course I didn’t pick up. She was drunk-dialing, or prank-dialing. I wasn’t going to let her sucker me into being her friend again just so she could turn around and crush me one more time.  
  
  ... body found in a motel room, alone . . .  
  
  I didn’t pick up. I didn’t listen to her messages yesterday. I was too angry to even look at the phone.  
  
  She’s still waiting for me.  
  
  I sit down on the mound of unwashed pajama bottoms and sweatshirts and dig out the phone. Open it. Cassie called thirty-three times, starting at 11:30 Saturday night.  
  
  RETRIEVE VOICE MAIL  
  
  “Lia? It’s me. Call me.”  
  
  Cassie.  
  
  Second message: “Where are you? Call me back.” Cassie.  
  
  Third: “I’m not playing, Overbrook. I really need to talk to you.”  
  
  Cassie, two days ago, Saturday.  
  
  “Call me.”  
  
  “Please, please, call me.”  
  
  “Look, I’m sorry I was such a bitch. Please.”  
  
  “I know you’re getting these messages.”  
  
  “You can be mad at me later, okay? I really need to talk to you.”  
  
  “You were right—it wasn’t your fault.”  
  
  “There’s nobody else to talk to.”  
  
  “Oh, God.”  
  
  From 1:20 to 2:55, she hung up fifteen times.  
  
  Next: “Please, Lia-Lia.” Her voice was slurring.  
  
  “I’m so sad. I can’t get out.”  
  
  “Call me. It’s a mess.”  
  
  Two more hang-ups.  
  
  3:20, very slurred: “I don’t know what to do.”  
  
  3:27. “I miss you. Miss you.”  
  
  I bury the phone at the bottom of the pile and put on a heavier sweatshirt before I head for my car. Winter comes early in New Hampshire.  
  
  005.00  
  
  My timing is perfect, and I wind up in a traffic jam. The cars around me are driven by fat cows and bellowing bulls. We roll along, six mph. I can run faster than this. We brake. They chew their cud and moo into their phones until the herd shifts gears and rolls forward again.  
  
  Fifteen miles an hour. I can’t run that fast.  
  
  Somewhere between Martins Corner and Route 28, I begin to cry. I turn on the radio, sing at the top of my lungs, turn it off again. I beat the steering wheel with my fists until I can see the bruises, and with every mile, I cry harder. Rain pours down my face.  
  
  ... body found in a motel room, alone . . .  
  
  What was she doing there? What was she thinking?  
  
  Did it hurt?  
  
  There’s no point in asking why, even though everybody will. I know why. The harder question is “why not?” I can’t believe she ran out of answers before I did.  
  
  I need to run, to fly, beating my wings so hard I can’t hear anything over the pounding of my heart. Rain, rain, rain, drowning me.  
  
  Was it easy?  
  
  I do not take any shortcuts, I do not forget to turn at the deli on the corner, I do not get lost, not even on purpose. I arrive at school on autopilot; late by their standards, early by mine. The last buses have just pulled up to the front door.  
  
  I get out and lock the car.  
  
  The unforgiving November wind blows me toward the building. Pointy snowflakes spiral down from the cake-frosting clouds overhead. The first snow. Magic. Everybody stops and looks up. The bus exhaust freezes, trapping all the noise in a gritty cloud. The doors to the school freeze, too.  
  
  We tilt back our heads and open wide.  
  
  The snow drifts into our zombie mouths crawling with grease and curses and tobacco flakes and cavities and boyfriend/girlfriend juice, the stain of lies. For one moment we are not failed tests and broken condoms and cheating on essays; we are crayons and lunch boxes and swinging so high our sneakers punch holes in the clouds. For one breath everything feels better.  
  
  Then it melts.  
  
  The bus drivers rev their engines and the ice cloud shatters. Everyone shuffles forward. They don’t know what just happened. They can’t remember.  
  
  she called me.  
  
  I walk back to my car, get in, turn on the heat, and wipe my face on my shirt. 7:30. Emma is done with French now and is unpacking her violin. She’ll spend too much time rosining her bow, and not enough tuning the strings. The Winter Concert is coming up in a few weeks, and she doesn’t know the songs yet. I should help her with that.  
  
  Cassie’s at the morgue, I guess. Last night she slept there in a silver drawer, eyes getting used to the dark.  
  
  Jennifer said they’re doing an autopsy. Who will cut off her clothes? Will they give her a bath, strangers touching her skin? Can she watch them? Will she cry?  
  
  The late bell rings, and the last people in the parking lot sprint for the door. Just a few minutes more. I can’t go in until the halls are empty and the teachers have numbed them with boredom so they won’t notice when I slip down the halls.  
  
  I turn around and clear a place in the backseat, shoving all the tests, sweatshirts, and overdue library books to one side so Emma will have a place to sit when I pick her up. Jennifer insists on sticking her in the back. It’s safer, she says.  
  
  There is no safer. There’s not even safe, never has been.  
  
  Cassie thought heaven was a fairy tale for stupid people. How can you find a place you don’t believe in? You can’t. So where does she go now? What if she comes back, eyes on angryfire?  
  
  7:35. Time to go to school and stop thinking.  
  
  006.00  
  
  No Honors Option for me, not this year. I am Contemp World Lit, Soc Sci 12—The Holocaust, Physics, Trig (again), and Lunch. No gym, thanks to a magic note from Dr. Parker. There are asterisks next to my name and footnotes that explain the situation.  
  
  . . . When I was a real girl, my mother fed me her glass dreams one spoonful at a time. Harvard. Yale. Princeton. Duke. Undergrad. Med school. Internship, residency, God. She’d brush my hair and braid it with long words, weaving the Latin roots and Greek branches into my head so memorizing anatomy would come easy.Dr. Marrigan was furious when the guidance counselor kicked me out of Honors and dropped me down to College Track. The counselor suggested that I plan on going to my father’s college, because they had to let me in. Free tuition for faculty kids, she reminded us.  
  
  I was relieved.  
  
  That night Dr. Marrigan told me that I was too smart to be a slacker faculty kid. She wanted to have me privately tested, to prove that I was brilliant and that the school was not meeting my needs. But then I screwed up again and they slammed me back in the hospital and when I got out, I changed all the rules.  
  
  I used to fantasize about taking the Mensa test to prove that I wasn’t a total loser. Maybe I’d score total off-the-hook genius. I’d make one hundred thousand photocopies of the test results, glue them to the walls of my mother’s house, take a bucket of red paint and a thick brush, and I’d write HA! a million times.  
  
  But there was a pretty good chance I’d flunk it. I really didn’t want to know.  
  
  The buzzer sounds. Students float from room to room. The teachers tie us to our chairs and pour worlds into our ears.  
  
  The shades are pulled and the lights are off in the physics lab so we can watch a movie about the speed of light and the speed of sound and some other garbage that doesn’t matter. Ghosts are waiting in the shadows of the room, patient dull shimmers. The others can see them, too, I know it. We’re all afraid to talk about what stares at us from the dark.  
  
  Waves of physics particles stream through the room.  
  
  she called me thirty-three times.  
  
  A ghost wraps herself around me, strokes my hair, and puts me to sleep.  
  
  The buzzer sounds. My classmates grab their books and race for the door. I have drooled on the desk.  
  
  My physics teacher (what is his name?) frowns at me. When he breathes through his open mouth, I can smell the night scum coating his tongue and the sunny-side-up eggs he ate for breakfast. “Are you planning on staying here all day?” he asks.  
  
  I shake my head no. Before he tries to be witty again, I grab my books and stand up. T  
oo fast. The floor tries to pull me down face-first, but my night-scummy teacher is watching so I make myself strong enough to float away, stars swimming in my eyes.  
  
  1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.  
  
  20.21.22.23.24.25.26.27.28.29.30.31.32.33.  
  
  “Dead girl walking,” the boys say in the halls.  
  
  “Tell us your secret,” the girls whisper, one toilet to another.  
  
  I am that girl.  
  
  I am the space between my thighs, daylight shining through.  
  
  I am the library aide who hides in Fantasy.  
  
  I am the circus freak encased in beeswax.  
  
  I am the bones they want, wired on a porcelain frame.  
  
  When I get close, they step back. The cameras in their eyeholes record the zit on my chin, the rain in my eyes, the blue water under my skin. They pick up every sound on their collar microphones. They want to pull me inside of them, but they’re afraid.  
  
  I am contagious.  
  
  I tiptoe to the nurse’s office, hand on the wall to keep me vertical. If I run or breathe too deep, the cheap stitches holding me together will snap, and all the stickiness inside will pour out and burn through the concrete.  
  
  The nurse ruffles her feathers when I slink in. She turns down the radio, cool jazz, and looks me over, hands on her hips, eyes sad and friendly.  
  
  “I thought you might stay home today,” she says. “It’s got to be a shock. Cassie was real close to you, wasn’t she?”  
  
  “I don’t feel good,” I say. “Can I lie down for a while?”  
  
  “You know the rules.”  
  
  She is a crafty witch in nurse’s clothing.  
  
  “Okay.” I sit on the chair next to her desk and let her take my temperature and blood pressure.  
  
  She wraps the cuff around my arm bone. “Are you still being weighed regularly?”  
  
  “Once a week. I’m fine. I don’t need to step on your scale.”  
  
  “You don’t look fine.” She jots down my numbers. “If you’re going to stay here, you have to get something in your system. If you don’t, it’s back to class.”  
  
  Do I want to die from the inside out or the outside in?  
  
  She opens up a carton of orange juice, pours it into a paper cup, and hands it to me as she removes the thermometer. “I’m serious.”  
  
  I take the cup from [her.my](http://her.my) hand does not want this my mouth does not want this.  
  
  The nurse wants this and I need to hide. I force it down.  
  
  The door opens and two guys walk in; one bleeding from his nose, the other looking a little freaked out at the sight of blood. The nurse makes the bleeder sit with his head tilted back and his buddy sit with his head between his knees so he doesn’t pass out.  
  
  I throw the paper cup in the trash can, take the newspaper off her desk, and retreat to the cot at the far end of the room.  
  
  “You’ll drink another one in fifteen minutes,” the nurse says. “Or you can have a lollipop: grape or lime.”  
  
  “Right.”  
  
  I pull the little screen in front of the cot, sit down, and search through the newspaper. Local section, page 2. The article runs for a couple of inches, next to an ad for fur coats, thirty percent off.  
  
  Police are investigating the death of 19-year-old Cassandra Parrish, of the town of Amoskeag, NH, whose body was discovered early Sunday morning in a room of the Gateway Motel on River Road in Centerville. Authorities were called to the scene at 4:43 A.M. by the motel employee who found the body. Preliminary indications suggest Miss Parrish may have died of natural causes, but police have not yet ruled out foul play or drug use.  
  
  “We’re still gathering information,” said police spokesperson Sgt. Anna Warren. “We’ll have a report about the time and cause of death when the coroner finishes the autopsy.”  
  
  Miss Parrish, known to friends as Cassie, was a popular athlete and member of the theater club at Amoskeag High. Her father, Jerry Parrish, is the principal of Park Street Elementary School, and her mother, Cindy, is active in school and community affairs. Amoskeag Superintendent of Schools Nelson Bushnel said the Parrish family’s loss was “heartbreaking.”  
  
  “Cassie was what we all want our children to be: bright, hardworking, and kind,” said Bushnell. When asked to comment on reports that Miss Parrish had a troubled background, he said, “Most teens today struggle with something. Cassie had made great strides in embracing a healthy life. The last time I talked to her father, he said she was trying to choose between studying psychology or French literature in college. Her death is as tragic as it is shocking.”  
  
  Autopsy results are expected later in the week. Funeral plans were incomplete at press time.  
  
  I lie down on the cot, the paper pillowcase crackling in my ears like radio static.  
  
  The buzzer sounds. The hall fills with a river of bodies and voices whispering that Cassie was murdered/no, she hung herself/no, she smoked or snorted her way to the Final Exit. She’d try anything once, did you hear about the time under the bleachers/at the mall/at summer camp? She drove herself into a speeding train/jumped without a parachute/strapped on a weight belt and dove into the ocean.  
  
  She offered herself to the big, bad wolf and didn’t scream when he took the first bite.  
  
  ... body found in a motel room, alone . . .  
  
  The boys are gone. The nurse takes the newspaper away and spreads a thin blanket over me.  
  
  “Can I get another one?” I ask. “I’m cold.”  
  
  “Sure thing.” She walks to the supply closet, her shoes squeaking on the polished floor.  
  
  “Have you heard anything about the funeral?” I ask.  
  
  “The superintendent’s office sent an e-mail,” she says. “The viewing will be Wednesday night at St. Stephen’s. They’ll bury her on Saturday.” She walks toward me, her arms loaded down. “Get some sleep now and remember: you’re drinking more orange juice when you wake up.”  
  
  “I promise.”  
  
  She covers me with all of the blankets she has (five) and the jackets from the lost-and-found box, because I am freezing. I drift into the armpits of strangers, tasting their manic salt, and sleep to forget everything.  
  
  007.00  
  
  Emma is buckled in the backseat watching a movie on the DVD player in her lap, eating potato chips and pounding a Mountain Dew slushie.  
  
  “Don’t tell Jennifer,” I say.  
  
  “Uh-huh.”  
  
  “Seriously. She’ll yell.”  
  
  “I heard you. Don’t tell or she’ll yell.” Emma’s eyes are glued to the screen, the chips moving one at a time into her mouth on a pink conveyor belt.  
  
  We’re lost. Again. My father doesn’t want me to get a GPS because he says I have to learn how to get around on my own. How can I figure out where I’m going if I’m lost all the time? I’ll ask Jennifer. Christmas is coming.  
  
  We pass a dying barn with a shattered roof, and a stained mattress shoved up against the speed-limit sign. Wouldn’t you notice if a mattress fell off your car? Maybe it was in the back of a truck loaded down with everything a girl owned, taking her to some guy she met online. She promised him her body and soul. He promised her three meals a day and a house but said the place could use more furniture. He didn’t stop when the mattress fell off. A new wife deserves a clean bed, that’s what he always said.  
  
  Maybe a leather-covered biker girl, butch and strong, is coming down the road a mile or so behind me. Any minute now, some idiot will cut in front of her and she’ll swerve and the bike will flip and send her screaming because she forgot her wings again and gravity never forgets  
  
  and then she’ll hit  
  
  that nasty mattress. And yeah, she’ll wind up with three broken ribs, a fractured femur, and a strained neck, but the ambulance drivers won’t ever mention that. They’ll always talk about how the stained mattress at the side of the road saved that chick’s life.  
  
  The smell of Emma’s potato chips is doing this to my brain.  
  
  By the time I find the Richland Park fields, practice has already started. Emma wants to stay in the car until the end of the movie.  
  
  
  “You need to get out there,” I say.  
  
  She groans and closes the player. “I hate soccer.”  
  
  “So tell them you want to quit.”  
  
  “Mom says the season is almost over and I’m not allowed.”  
  
  “So get out there and play. Have fun.”  
  
  She looks at my eyes in the rearview mirror. “Nobody ever kicks me the ball.”  
  
  Emma is a mattress who got thrown off the truck when her parents split up. I can’t remember the last time her father called. Jennifer is determined to carve her into the perfect-little-girl who will turn into the perfect-young-lady whose shining accomplishments will prove to the world that Jennifer is the absolutely perfect mother.  
  
  It’s not like you can blame a mattress when people don’t tie it down tight enough.  
  
  I open my door. “Come on. I’ll kick the ball to you.”  
  
  She closes the player and tosses it on the seat. “No, you said you have homework.” She suddenly can’t get out fast enough. “Bye, Lia. Drive safe.”  
  
  It takes a couple of heartbeats to figure out what just happened. One. Two. Three. The smells are messing with my neurons again.  
  
  I roll down the window. “Emma. Hang on.”  
  
  She slowly walks back to the car, hugging the soccer ball tight. “What?”  
  
  “I changed my mind. I want to watch you practice. Where should I sit?”  
  
  Her eyes fly open. “No, you can’t.”  
  
  “Why not? Other people are watching.”  
  
  “Um, it’s just . . .” She looks at her cleats and mumbles. “You can watch from the car. It’s warmer.”  
  
  There are shouts from the field, nine-year-olds psyching themselves up for the kill. Travel soccer is intense.  
Emma, look at me.” How did Jennifer’s voice sneak into my throat? “Why don’t you want me to get out of the car?”  
  
  She kicks the gravel. Tiny stones bounce up and ding the paint on my door.  
  
  “Coach asked me if it was true you had cancer.” She kicks again. “’Cause he heard you were in the hospital and . . . you know. I said yes.” Whistles blow on the field. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know what else to say.”  
  
  “It’s okay,” I say. “I understand. Don’t worry about it.”  
  
  The ball slips out of her hands and rolls toward the field. “You’re not mad at me?”  
  
  “I can never be mad at you, silly.”  
  
  She finally looks up. “Thanks, Lia.”  
  
  “And you’re right, I have a ton of homework.” I start the engine. “My teachers will love you for making me deal with it. See you later?”  
  
  She smiles. “Okay. I think there are some chips left, if you’re hungry.”  
  
  I roll up the window.  
  
  I wish I had cancer.  
  
  I will burn in hell for that, but it’s true.  
  
  008.00  
  
  The air at the gas station is heavy with diesel and the smell of rancid deep-fryer fat from the McDonald’s next door. Five days ago I weighed 101.30 pounds. I had to eat at Thanksgiving (vultures all around the table), but since then it’s been mostly water and rice cakes.I stick three pieces of gum in my mouth, throw out Emma’s potato chips, and fill the tank. I am disgusting.  
  
  ... The first time they admitted me, I was black and blue and purple and red because I passed out and hit the car in front of us while Cassie screamed and the steering wheel exploded. This body weighed 093.00 pounds.  
  
  My roommate atNew Seasons was a long, withered zucchini who cried in bed and let the snot run down the sides of her face. Everybody on the staff was whale-sized and sweaty. The nurse who handed out meds was so fat her skin was stretched tight. If she moved too fast, it would rip open and her yellow stuffing would spill out, ruining her Disney World sweatshirt.  
  
  I bit the days off in rows, corn kernels that popped in my mouth and wedged between my teeth. Bite. Chew. Swallow. Again. Bite. Chew. Swallow. Again.  
  
  I was a good girl because I didn’t poke holes in my skin (scars noted) or write depressing poetry (journals checked while we were in session) and I ate and ate. They stuffed me like a pink little piggy ready for market. They killed me with mushy apples and pasta worms and little cakes that marched out of the oven and lay down to be frosted. I bit, chewed, swallowed day after day and lied, lied, lied. (Who wants to recover? It took me years to get that tiny. I wasn’t sick; I was strong.) But staying strong would keep me locked up. The only way out was to shove in food until I waddled.

There basically isn't any time in my life where I feel strongly relaxed, even when I'm sleeping. I'm sure many people can relate.

Related to this, I've discovered I'm very sensitive to the effects of caffeine, and even a modest amount of it will raise my anxiety level substantially for several hours afterwards. Even a drink as small as a latte will make it worse. 

However, what if I were to drink lots of caffeine every day? If I were to drink two cups of coffee every morning until I built up a tolerance to the effects of caffeine, would I still experience the heightened anxiety from it at that point? And furthermore, if I did this and then stopped drinking it one day, would the likely resulting drowsiness from caffeine withdraw actually make my general anxiety go down?",1,1754898946.0,mentalhealth,2,1.0,False

I looked at my phone, but I couldn’t help but frown.  
  
I am glad that my sister is getting married, but I really don’t want to go home.   
  
And I won’t be able to get out of this at all.  
  
My older sister is different from our mother and me.   
  
She is kind and has always been there for me all this time.  
  
I have been gone for 6 years now, and it is time I went back home.  
  
I will admit that I miss everyone, I miss my siblings, my father, and even my mother.   
  
Maybe she would have changed by now.   
  
I really hope that she has changed.  
  
I put my phone back in the locker and then closed it before doing my rounds.  
  
I am a nurse and I work in the ICU department.  
  
I have always wanted to be a nurse and work at my town’s hospital. It is not as big as the hospital I work at now, but I would have been happier there.  
  
I would be able to use portions and my magic to heal wounds. But here, I can only use science and pray that the person pulls through.  
  
""Nurse Jade, please go home. You have been here for 30 hours."" The head nurse said.  
  
""We are understaffed, and I should help where I can,"" I said, and she shook her head.  
  
""If you don’t rest, then you will faint, and we will be one man short."" She said and then smiled. ""Go and rest, you have a long journey ahead of you."" She said, and I nodded.  
  
I took my things, went straight home, and took a bath before ordering takeout.  
  
As I was busy, a text came through, and I looked at it.  
  
It was a photo that Sasha had sent.  
  
I had a look at it and smiled.  
  
She was still as beautiful as I remembered her.  
  
Her green eyes had that same glint of kindness.  
  
You see, my sister took after my mother, and she has green eyes.  
  
But she took my father’s brown hair and not our mother’s blond eyes.  
  
As for Jay, he has blond hair and brown eyes.  
  
As for me, I took after my father; I have his brown eyes and hair.  
  
To be honest, I always thought that I was plain compared to my siblings.  
  
I looked at the photo, and Sasha looked so happy with her future husband. I can’t believe they met a month ago and are already getting married. But that is to be expected, and she is marrying a werewolf.  
  
Actually, I think for werewolves, a month is too long for them. The moment they find their mate, they don’t wait at all, and mate right away, and then mark each other. I think it is because the man who is her mate is an Alpha. So, he couldn’t make the reckless move of marrying a witch without putting measures in place. He needs to think as an Alpha and think about what is best for his people. He must have figured it out, and he seemed to be madly in love with her.  
  
They look good together, and I bet they will be a happy couple.  
  
I woke up in the morning and drove home. I was nervous and also happy to be going back.  
  
I left the city a little too late, and I was running behind. I will probably arrive there by dinner time.  
  
The moment I saw the sign that was welcoming me back to my town, I felt my heart dance.  
  
I am home, and after so long, I am finally home.  
  
I got home and parked my car outside, and I stopped for a second to look at the Bennet mansion. About three families live here, and it’s considered a family house. My uncle lives here with his wife and kids, and my Aunt lives here with hers as well.  
  
I walked in, and the door was already open.  
  
The moment I came to view, I saw my family talking and laughing about something.  
  
""Jade,"" Jay yelled at the top of his lungs as he looked at me. All eyes turned to me, and I just smiled and waved.  
  
Jay ran to my side and hugged me as tightly as he could.  
  
""You are here, it was getting so late I thought you weren’t coming."" He said, and his voice scared me for a second.  
  
""OMG, what happened to your voice?"" I asked him.  
  
""Puberty,"" Jane said as she came to my side as well.  
  
""Don’t tell me that this is also puberty,"" I said, pointing at Jane. They had both grown up so much, and it is expected since it’s been 6 years.  
  
""You are here,"" Sasha said as she hugged me as well.  
  
""Kiddo, my beautiful daughter is back at home."" My dad said as he hugged me.  
  
All eyes turned to my mother as if they were waiting to see what she was going to say.  
  
""Welcome home."" She said, sitting down, and I just smiled at this. I am hearing her voice again for the first time in 6 years.  
  
""Thank you, Mother,"" I said, and they all made me sit on a chair.  
  
""Greetings,"" I said, greeting the guests, and they all nodded.  
  
""I had promised your sister that I wouldn’t ruin her special day."" Mother suddenly said, and I rolled my eyes at this.  
  
""But?"" I asked her, and she scoffed a little at this.  
  
""What have you done to your hair? What is that?"" she asked me, and I frowned.  
  
""What’s wrong with my hair? I like it a lot."" I said, and she frowned.  
  
My hair was in a long wolf cut, and it was great in my eyes.  
  
""You cut your hair. You know that once a witch reaches a certain age, they can’t cut their hair."" She said, and I frowned.  
  
""Or what? For the past few years, I have cut my hair more times than I can count."" I said, and she scoffed.  
  
""You weaken your magic."" She said, and I smiled as my eyes landed on a glass of wine. I lifted the bottle of wine with magic and bought it my way. I opened my mouth and started gulping down the contents. I then put it back on the table and looked at her with a smile.  
  
""Look at that. My magic still works very well."" I said, and she just scoffed. I bet she is thinking about how what I did is nothing.  
  
""Come on, Mommy, and you too, Jade. Don’t fight tonight."" Sasha said and then held my hand. ""This is my future husband, Dante Odell."" She said, pointing at the man I recognized on the phone.  
  
""Nice to meet you, Alpha,"" I said, and he just nodded.  
  
""Also, a pleasure to meet you as well."" He said.  
  
""Well, future Luna, I had been hoping that you had a sister as beautiful as you. Well, I saw it wrong. You are extremely beautiful, Jade."" This other guy said.  
  
""Thank you,"" I said, and then greeted everyone else.  
  
""So, what do you do for a living, Jade?"" the guy who called me beautiful asked. I think his name was Piers or something along those lines.  
  
""I am a nurse in the city,"" I answered.  
  
""In the city? Why didn’t you become a nurse here?"" he asked me, and Mom snickered.  
  
""This place, it doesn’t feel like home for me. The minute I enter through that door, I feel like a weight is put on my shoulder."" I answered, and Mom scoffed again.  
  
""That weight is called responsibility, something you would never understand."" She retorted.  
  
""Mommy, enough, please,"" Sasha said and then held my hand.  
  
The rest of dinner was just my mother trying to get to me, and nothing else.  
  
I tied my hair up into a messy bun and took a shower.  
  
I was still hungry, considering that I hardly ate because of the uncomfortable atmosphere.  
  
When I got out, I found the PJs that my sister had left for me on the bed. I got dressed and went downstairs to have some food.  
  
I started eating when suddenly someone grabbed my waist.  
  
""Come back to bed."" The voice said, and his hand slipped into my clothes and cupped my breasts.  
  
I wanted to tell this person that they had the wrong person, but I just froze.  
  
""I can’t wait to place my mark here. You feel different today."" He said and started kissing my neck.  
  
""I am not who you think I am."" I finally blurted out. He immediately let go of me and put some distance between us.  
  
I turned around and standing there looking at me with a completely pale face was my future brother-in-law.  
  
""I am so sorry, I thought you were Sasha."" He said, and I could tell he was genuine.  
  
""No, I am sorry. I am wearing her clothes, and we have the same hair color, and we tie up our hair during bedtime."" I said, and he looked at his hand.  
  
""I am really sorry for everything I just did."" He said, and I smiled.  
  
""It’s all water under the bridge,"" I said, and he sighed.  
  
""I don’t know why, but my nose and ears don’t work here at all."" He said, and I smiled.  
  
""They put measures in place to be able to confuse our enemies. A witch’s town is a terrible place for a werewolf or vampire. Your sight, scent, and all other abilities are suppressed."" I explained, and he nodded.  
  
""Sasha mentioned something like that."" He said, and then looked at me.  
  
""Again, I am sorry about this."" He said, and I just shrugged.  
  
""Good night, Alpha Dante,"" I said and then walked off.  
  
The moment I got to my room, I finally released the breath I didn’t even know I was holding.  
  
He is going to be my brother-in-law, so why did I like and enjoy his touch?  
  
Why didn’t it feel wrong to be touched by him in that way?  
  


# Chapter 2: Dreams

1441 WordsJade’s pov  
  
It’s not a big deal, Jade.  
  
Yes, I felt that way because it was the first time I had ever been touched by a man.  
  
I closed my eyes and tried to sleep, but I couldn’t, no matter how hard I tried.  
  
I got up, and my eyes landed on my reflection in the mirror.  
  
I can see why he mistook me for Sasha. We have the same body built, and because of our hair tied up, we could easily be mistaken for one another.  
  
I looked around my room for a scissor and then sat down.  
  
I undid my messy bun and started cutting my hair.  
  
I can make a short wolf cut. I think it won’t be that hard for me.  
  
I slowly and carefully cut the long hair and then looked at myself in the mirror.  
  
I am doing this because I feel bad about what happened tonight. So, I don’t want to be mistaken for Sasha ever again.  
  
I took off the Pjs I was wearing and just wore a large t-shirt that I had in my closet.  
  
I could only sleep for 2 hours, and I woke up too early, so I decided to go on a run.  
  
As I was on the trail, I met with my brother-in-law, and he seemed just as uncomfortable as I was.  
  
""Hello, Alpha Dante."" I said, and he nodded a little.  
  
""You cut your hair, is it because of what happened last night?"" He asked me, and I shook my head.  
  
""I want to piss off my mother just a little. She made comments about my hair during dinner."" I said, and he nodded.  
  
""I recall."" He said and then was looking anywhere but me. ""I am going to tell your sister about what happened."" he said, and I frowned.  
  
""You can tell her, but not today. It’s your wedding day, and she has been looking forward to it all her life. And what happened was a mistake. It is not like we enjoyed it or did it on purpose, you can explain the incident later on."" I said, and he nodded.  
  
""I will tell her, just not today."" He said, and I nodded.  
  
""Well then, good day."" I said and then ran off.  
  
That is something that is hard to find these days, and that is an honest man. My sister is lucky to have found someone like him, and I hope that they have a good life.  
  
I got to my room and then showered before going to find Sasha in her room.  
  
We were getting ready in her room.  
  
""Look at you, and you are looking beautiful already."" I said, and she smiled at this.  
  
""Really? My makeup is not even done yet, and I haven’t worn the dress."" She said and looked at herself in the mirror. ""I hope that you will find a man like Dante. He seems cold and distant at first but is absolutely amazing."" she said and then blushed.  
  
""Why are you blushing like that?"" I asked her, and she looked at the girls doing her makeup and then me.  
  
""He is great in bed."" She said and giggled.  
  
""Really? I heard the same as well, I heard that werewolves are amazing in bed."" One of the girls said.  
  
""It’s not just a myth, and I wake up all sore, but in a good way. I have had many partners in my life, but he outranks them."" She added.  
  
The girls were giggling and then one of them looked at Sasha.  
  
""How big is he?"" She asked Sasha who just smirked.  
  
""You are not going to tell them about private details with your husband are you?"" I asked her, and she just shrugged.  
  
""Stop being a virgin, stop acting like you don’t want to know."" One of the girls said.  
  
""He is this big."" Sasha said, measuring the length with her hands. They all started giggling, and the door opened.  
  
""Oh my, my darling daughter looks so beautiful."" Mom said looking at Sasha. She kissed her forehead, and then her eyes landed on me.  
  
I watched how that smile turned into a massive frown.  
  
""What have you done to your hair?"" She asked me.  
  
""Do you like it? You didn’t like my hair yesterday, so I thought that I would fix it for you. Do you like it?"" I asked her.  
  
Sasha put her hand on Mom’s shoulder and then looked at me.  
  
""You look beautiful, doesn’t she mom?"" She asked. Mom just walked out without another word, and I smiled.  
  
""Thank you."" I said, and she nodded.  
  
""Did you really cut your hair just to piss Mommy off?"" She asked me, and I shook my head.  
  
""Then why?"" She asked me, and I just shrugged. It’s not like I can tell her that I did it so that I won’t think about the little moment I had with her husband. Where would I even start such a thing?  
  
I will not ruin her big day because of an accident.  
  
We attended the wedding, and they said their vows, and then when everything was done, I decided to slip away and leave.  
  
""Aren’t you going to say goodbye?"" Alpha Dante suddenly appeared out of nowhere.  
  
""I am not very good at goodbyes."" I explained, and he nodded.  
  
""Have a safe trip, Jade."" He said, and I nodded and then got into my car. I could see him through my mirror, and he was just standing there watching as I drove away.  
  
I got to my apartment and took a quick shower, and as I was about to sleep, my phone rang.  
  
""You left without saying goodbye."" Sasha said, and I smiled.  
  
""Goodbyes are not my forte."" I answered, and she chuckled.  
  
""I know. Don’t be a stranger, okay? Come and visit me and Dante once I have settled in."" she said.  
  
""I will think about it."" I answered.  
  
""Come on, our honeymoon just started. Hang up the phone."" I heard Alpha Dante’s voice on the other side.  
  
My sister chuckled as the call ended, and I just sighed.  
  
Whatever these feelings are, I know that they will be gone in a few days.  
  
I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep.  
  
""Hello, beautiful."" Someone said kissing my neck.  
  
""You smell really good."" He said, and he put his hands inside the large t-shirt I was wearing. He cupped my breasts and played with my n\*\*\*\*\*s with his hands.  
  
""I missed you."" He whispered as his other hand started going lower to my panties.  
  
""Did you miss me as much as I missed you?"" he asked me, and I nodded.  
  
""More actually."" I responded and leaned to his touch. He started slowly rubbing my clit with his hand, and I held on to the kitchen island.  
  
""If you want me to stop, then all you have to do is say it."" He said, and I shook my head, moaning.  
  
""Don’t stop, please keep going."" I pleaded. My voice was gentle and below a whisper but full of need.  
  
""You are mine Jade, you are all mine."" He said, and I smiled at this.  
  
""Take me, take me now, and make me all yours."" I said, and he chuckled and then turned me around.  
  
""Alpha Dante, what are you doing here?"" I asked him.  
  
I quickly opened my eyes and looked around the dark room.  
  
Wait, did I just have a s\*x dream about my brother-in-law?  
  
No this cannot be happening.  
  
I got off the bed and went to the kitchen to get a bottle of water.  
  
After I gulped down all that water I sat down, and I just wanted to punch myself in the face.  
  
Why would I have a s\*x dream about my sister’s husband and mate? It is so inappropriate, and what was I even saying in that dream?  
  
That I am all his, and he can take me.  
  
Oh gosh, what should I do about all of this?  
  
It was an accident, and I shouldn’t have read so much into it. He didn’t enjoy any of that, and I only enjoyed it because I had never been touched by a man that way. It is a new experience for me, once I get a boyfriend then this will be all over.  
  
I just need another man to touch me like he did and then erase everything. It will work, right?  
  
He is my brother-in-law, and I shouldn’t even be thinking about him in this way. He is probably in some honeymoon suit, sleeping next to his wife, who is my sister.  
  
Get a grip, Jade.

""What happened to your hair?"" I asked her, touching her short hair.  
  
""I cut it, do you like it?"" She asked me, and I smiled.  
  
""Yes, now it exposes the sweet spot on your neck that I am going to mark."" I said. I started showing slow kisses on her neck.  
  
""Your scent is different today."" I said but she didn’t answer me and continued chopping the vegetables.  
  
""Come on, stop what you are doing and give me some."" I said and continued kissing her neck. My hands started roaming all over her body, and she stopped.  
  
""I am cooking for you. Aren’t you hungry?"" She asked me, and I smiled.  
  
""I am starving, but for you and not the food."" I said, and she chuckled.  
  
""Don’t distract me."" She said, and I smiled, and I put my hands under the satin night dress she was wearing. I smiled as she started moaning, and that sound sounded like music to my ears.  
  
""Come on, just one round. For 20 minutes, a little quickie."" I said, and she chuckled.  
  
""It’s never a quickie with you."" She retorted, and she was right. ""Fine then, but take your time. I like having you inside me.""  
  
She turned around and looking at me with seductive eyes was Jade.  
  
I opened my eyes and looked around the room.  
  
Did I just have a s\*x dream about my sister-in-law?  
  
It’s been 6 months. Then why can’t I get her out of my mind? I had no idea that the one mistake I made would haunt me even until now.  
  
I looked at Sasha, who was still very fast asleep.  
  
She really can’t handle my stamina at all. After s\*x she sleeps like the dead.  
  
I covered her naked body with a blanket and then got dressed so I could go on a run.  
  
When I got to my spot on the cliff, I stopped for a second just to think.  
  
I need to do something about all these dreams about Jade. How can someone I have only met once torment me like this?  
  
I told Sasha about the incident with her sister and even told her that it was a mistake.  
  
Well, I didn’t tell her everything, but I did tell her that I hugged her sister thinking it was her. She just laughed about it when I told her how mortified her sister was. Then why do I still feel so guilty and restless about what happened?  
  
I am not my father. I would never do anything to hurt my mate at all.  
  
My father, an Alpha who had a mate and kids, left us and his mate for another woman. And he never looked back. He left 4 kids behind for another woman.  
  
He left me with all his responsibilities, and I would never do such a thing.  
  
All these dreams, they will never be fulfilled, and I will make sure of that. I will find a way to get rid of her from my dreams and thoughts.  
  
I ran back to the pack mansion and then got into the shower.  
  
“Can I join you?” Sasha asked me, and I nodded as she walked in. She wrapped her hands around me and then smiled.  
  
“How about one round before we start the day?” she asked me.  
  
“I would love that.” I said and crashed my lips into hers. She moaned a little and turned around, and I started kissing her neck.  
  
“I am not who you think I am.” I heard a voice say.  
  
I opened my eyes to look at Sasha, and she turned around to look at me. I took a step back and almost hit the glass of the shower when my eyes landed on her.  
  
“Are you okay, Dante?” Sasha asked me, and I nodded.  
  
“No, you are not okay. You look like you just saw a ghost.” She said, and I just sighed.  
  
“It’s nothing.” I said and then sighed as I got out of the shower.  
  
“Did I do something wrong?” She asked me, and I shook my head.  
  
“No, I am sorry, but can we do it another time?” I asked her, and she nodded.  
  
I can’t tell her the truth. I can’t tell her that for a second there, I thought she was her sister.  
  
I hallucinated and even heard her voice in my head as well.  
  
What the hell is wrong with me?  
  
That Jade, did she do something to me?  
  
Did she use some kind of witchcraft on me?  
  
But why would she do such a thing?  
  
I got dressed, and Sasha joined me as we were going downstairs to have breakfast.  
  
“Are you okay, brother? You look terrible.” Tia, my younger sister, asked me.  
  
“Yes, come to think of it, something isn’t right with you. You seem restless and jumpy.” My mother said with a frown.  
  
“I am fine.” I said and sat down to have breakfast.  
  
I looked up when I felt eyes looking at me. I found my Beta Felix looking at me with a smile on his face but didn’t say anything.  
  
“Sasha, I have been meaning to ask you something.” Felix said, looking at my mate.  
  
“What is it?” Sasha asked, moving a few strands of hair behind her ear. Her green eyes were looking at him with intrigue, and she had a small smile on her lips.  
  
“Your little sister, Jade.” Felix said, and I decided to sip on my coffee while listening to what he had to say.  
  
“Is she single?” He blurted out, and I found myself choking on the coffee I was drinking.  
  
“Are you okay?” Sasha asked me concerned, and I nodded.  
  
“I think that she has a boyfriend.” Sasha answered, and I frowned a bit at this.  
  
“Really? How do you know?” Felix asked her, and Sasha smiled brightly.  
  
“I saw pictures of them at the beach.” She answered and then took out her phone. She started browsing, and when she was done, she handed me the phone.  
  
“Look at that, they look good together don’t they?” She asked me, and I frowned.  
  
It was a picture of Jade wearing a grey bikini, and there was a guy next to her. His hands were on her waist, touching her very bare skin. I felt this anger rise inside me; how dare he touch her?  
  
“Let me see, man.” Felix said, taking the phone away from me.  
  
“Oh, she is hot.” Felix said and then smiled as he looked at Sasha. “Call her, don’t you want your sister to be near you?”  
  
“What? You talk as if you are serious about her. Will you stop waiting for your mate and marry my sister?” Sasha asked with a small chuckle.  
  
“Why not?” He asked and then smiled when Sasha nodded.  
  
She dialed her sister’s number and then put it on speaker. I found myself holding my breath. Why is this happening to me?  
  
“Hello,” Her gentle voice said on the other hand.  
  
I found myself closing my eyes when I realized that she sounded like she was sleeping.  
  
“Were you sleeping?” Sasha asked her.  
  
“Yes, why are you calling me so early?” Jade asked clearly a little annoyed.  
  
“I wanted to ask you if the guy with you at the beach is your boyfriend?” Sasha asked her.  
  
I heard JADE groan, f\*\*k why is my body reacting this way just from hearing her voice?  
  
“Yes, he is my boyfriend and right now he is sleeping next to me.” Jade answered, and Sasha smiled.  
  
“Really?” She asked, and her sister sighed.  
  
“No, why are you suddenly interested in my love life? I am sleeping at home alone because I don’t have a boyfriend. I am an ER nurse; I don’t even have time to do my nails, so when will I get time to get a boyfriend?” She asked, and then Sasha frowned.  
  
“Then who is that guy? Your f\*\*k buddy?” She asked wiggling her eyebrows even though the other girl couldn’t see it.  
  
“He is a colleague, he invited me to join him and his husband to the beach. I was a third wheel.” Jade answered.  
  
“Now please hang up, I just worked a 30 hour shift, and I am tired.” She added.  
  
“Fine,” Sasha said with a frown.  
  
Why did I feel relieved that the man wasn’t her boyfriend? What the hell is happening with me? She is no one to me, so why am I so possessive over her?  
  


# Chapter 4: Tug of war

""Nurse Jade, there is a patient in the ER I would like you to take care of."" The doctor said, and I nodded. I quickly ran to the patient and found her busy talking to herself.  
  
I could feel it from where I was that she was or was a witch.  
  
A rogue witch who has been cast out of her coven.  
  
There is nothing the doctor can do for her, and I also can’t do anything for her as well.  
  
I went to her and started doing a routine check on her. Her eyes landed on me, and I froze on the spot when I saw who she was.  
  
""You, you and your mother did this to me!"" She said getting off the bed. She tried to attack me, but the guards held her back.  
  
""She is unstable, put her under until she is better and get a psych here. They will deal with this."" The Doctor said, and I looked at her. The hate in her eyes as she was looking at me, and I couldn’t blame her.  
  
""I am so sorry."" I said to her, and she scoffed.  
  
""I hope you and your mother die a painful death. She did this to me!"" She said pointing at her state. She was then put under and taken to the psych department, and I just stood there.  
  
""What’s wrong nurse?"" The Doctor asked me, and I just shrugged.  
  
""Come on, you have work to do. Don’t let whatever that mad woman said get to you."" He said and patted my shoulder.  
  
I finished up my work and then, as I was about to leave, I got an idea.  
  
I went to the psych department to check on the witch earlier. She was looked up in a protected room, so she doesn’t harm herself or anyone. I could see through a small window. It was made of plastic and doesn’t break easily.  
  
I watched as she was busy talking to herself and moving around. She seemed to be in pain, my mother did that to her. I didn’t stop her, I couldn’t stop her, so I think that I am also to blame as well.  
  
""What are you still doing here? You just worked a 40 hour shift and should go home."" The doctor said, and I nodded.  
  
""Looking forward to your day off?"" He asked me, and I nodded.  
  
""It’s been so long since I took one. I am thinking of going to the beach and just unwinding."" I said, and he smiled.  
  
""I would join you, but I am assisting in a surgery tomorrow."" He said, and I nodded.  
  
""I can go on my own."" I said and then sighed looking at the woman one last time.  
  
""Try to flirt with guys, you work hard and need some s\*\*\*\*l healing."" He said, and I rolled my eyes at this.  
  
I got a taxi and when I got home I took a shower and heated some soup before sitting down and eating. I took out my phone and started looking at any potential dates on the dating apps.  
  
I am just looking for a one-night stand, I need to get those images out of my mind.  
  
It feels like I am being taunted.  
  
I have tried many things to stop those dreams from happening.  
  
I have tried every spell I could think of, but nothing is working.  
  
But I think that this is like the pink elephant analogy. If you are asked not to think about the pink elephant, then all you can think about is the pink elephant.  
  
Maybe I have been trying too hard, which would explain why he is still stuck in my mind.  
  
And this guilt, the guilt that comes along with the realization that I am having a s\*x dream about my brother-in-law.  
  
I should know better than anyone that there are things I can’t outrun.  
  
At first, I just thought that only bad memories can’t be outrun but I was wrong.  
  
Turns out even a memory that is good can haunt you.  
  
I know, I feel absolutely terrible that I even call what happened that night a good memory. But what else should I call it?  
  
I liked it. I liked every second of it, which explains why I am still dreaming about it.  
  
I don’t know what I should do about any of this anymore.  
  
I seriously just need to get laid and then that’s it.  
  
Dreams about him will disappear, so I have a new mission now and it is to get laid before going back to work. I have about 3 days off and I need to get it done within that time.  
  
How hard can it be?  
  
I am a good-looking woman in her early 20s and I am sexy. All I need to do is to work on my s\*x appeal and then I will pull in men like a magnet.  
  
That woman, should I go and check on her tomorrow?  
  
Fuck, so far all I have done is hear about what happens but never saw it with my own eyes. She seemed to be in serious pain and seemed to be suffering.  
  
I heard the Doctor talking about how there was nothing they could do for her. They don’t know what is wrong with her and the truth is that they will never be able to figure it out. That is just what happens to a rogue witch, they lose their magic slowly, and then their sanity, and then their life.  
  
Being part of a coven means that you are linked to our ancestors who are the ones that determine the flow of magic. If your link with them is severed, then you become a rogue.  
  
I closed my eyes as I remembered how that woman came to be in that situation.  
  
Flashback  
  
""Why do I have to come with you? I am only 14 years old."" I said to my mother.  
  
""And you will be coven leader after me. So yes, you are coming with me to this."" She said, and I sighed and stopped.  
  
""What now?"" She asked me getting annoyed.  
  
""Mother, this event is for grownups. You measure your magic to see who is more powerful than the other. I don’t need to know any of that."" I explained, and she rolled her eyes.  
  
""You will need to do so, and if you hold back then I won’t spare you."" She said and dragged my hand.  
  
We got to the grounds, and I looked at the full moon that was lighting up the sky.  
  
""What is a child doing here?"" A woman asked looking at my mother.  
  
""This child will be your future coven leader."" My mother said, and I rolled my eyes.  
  
""Seriously Samantha, she is just a child."" My aunt Emily said. She is my mother’s younger sister and also is in some kind of competition with my mother.  
  
""Now start."" My mother said and then the people started.  
  
It’s basically a tug of war using magic and this time instead of pulling we are pushing. Whoever falls down first from the pressure of the other’s magic loses.  
  
""You are next, don’t hold back and embarrass me."" My mother said, and I frowned.  
  
If I give it my all, then I will be here all night. But if I lose from the start, then no one will shame me since I am just a kid.  
  
When I say no one, my mother isn’t included because she shames me any chance she gets.  
  
""Your mother obviously doesn’t care about you. She wants you dead, that is why she bought you here."" The woman said.  
  
I just sighed and got ready while she did the same.  
  
I could feel it, she was giving it all she had.  
  
I started strong and then slowly decreased the pressure of my magic. I could feel her magic pushing me away slowly. She looked at me and then smirked before suddenly releasing a surge of magic that blew me off.  
  
I hit a nearby tree and felt the air being knocked out of my lungs.  
  
""I told you not to hold back."" My mother said as she walked towards me. I just hit a tree and all she can think about is what she told me I should do.  
  
""And you, I heard the threat you made to my daughter when you first started. She is a child, why didn’t you hold back?"" My mother asked the woman.  
  
""That is exactly what we have been trying to tell you. She is a child and shouldn’t be in a place like this."" Aunt Emily said.  
  
""Because she needs to learn these things. I am preparing her for the future. You are my sister Emily, but if you question me one more time then you won’t like the consequences."" My mother said.  
  
""And you, for this act of trying to harm your future leader. I am banishing you from this Coven."" My mother said and then looked at me.  
  
""Get up, let’s go."" She said, and I nodded and tried to get up. I had to use the tree to balance myself and then got up.  
  
I was in extreme pain, but I couldn’t show it because she honestly didn’t care.  
  
""You are not criticizing me. You planned all of this didn’t you?"" I asked her stopping.  
  
""Well, you are smart enough to pick up on it."" She said and then stopped.  
  
""Yes, I bought you here knowing that you would hold back. And you did and because of that I managed to turn that b\*\*\*h into a rouge."" My mother said.  
  
""What if I got injured worse than I did? What if she killed me?"" I asked her.  
  
""You are not dead, are you?"" She simply retorted and then continued walking.  
  
End of flashback  
  
I still don’t know why she risked my life, what did that woman do to deserve such a punishment?

It’s lucky.” Her mom looked mortified and tried to apologize, but I just smiled and thanked the girl. She grinned, waved, and skipped back to her seat like she’d just performed a great act of heroism.
I sat there for a moment, just holding this stubby pink crayon, realizing how pure and giving kids can be. To her, that little crayon was a treasure—and she gave it to a complete stranger because maybe I looked like I needed a bit of magic in my day.

And she was right. I didn’t know I needed that moment until it happened.

The crayon’s in my pocket now. I don’t think I’ll ever throw it away.",5,1754898833.0,u_CherryLexa32,0,1.0,False

I’ll tell you exactly what happened.

Not long ago, I was stuck. My side hustle had potential, but my brain felt like it was running through mud. I’d sit at my laptop, staring at the screen, wondering why I couldn’t focus. My energy came in random bursts, my creativity would sputter out after an hour, and every decision felt heavier than it should.

Then I came across something that promised to **unlock my mental clarity** and help me push past that sluggishness. I was skeptical—everyone promises life-changing results these days. But the formula caught my attention. It wasn’t just another caffeine pill or a hype-heavy “energy booster.” It claimed to work from the inside out, starting with deep detox, then protection from oxidative stress, and finally activation of sharper focus and intuition.

The first week was subtle. My sleep got deeper. The morning brain fog lifted faster. Then, something unexpected happened—my ideas started flowing. Not scattered, frantic ideas, but structured, profitable concepts I could act on immediately.

I started waking up earlier, almost naturally, with this clear drive to **execute instead of overthink**. My side hustle, which had been crawling along for months, suddenly had momentum. The extra hours of productive work meant I could launch a new offer, build out an entire funnel in one weekend, and start connecting with clients at a level I hadn’t managed before.

Within 30 days, I closed my biggest deal yet—something I’d been chasing for over a year. My network started noticing. They’d ask what changed, and I’d tell them the truth: I finally had **laser-sharp focus**, consistent mental energy, and the kind of creative flow that turns a struggling project into a thriving business.

This wasn’t luck. It was about getting my mind and body in sync so I could perform at my peak every single day. When your thoughts are clear, your decisions are sharper. When your energy doesn’t crash, your output skyrockets. And when your creativity flows without resistance, your business can leap forward in ways that feel almost unfair.

I’ve learned that success isn’t about working harder—it’s about **working in alignment with a mind that’s firing on all cylinders**. And once you get there, you’ll never want to go back.

Here’s where it got interesting for me.

I didn’t just want to *feel* better—I wanted to understand **how this pineal gland detox supplement** was working. The formula wasn’t some random blend of trendy herbs. It followed a three-phase approach that, in hindsight, makes perfect sense for someone who needs both mental performance and long-term stamina.

The **first phase** hit me in ways I didn’t expect: detox.  
Your pineal gland can get sluggish from years of buildup—fluoride, heavy metals, and all the other toxins that cloud mental clarity. For me, this phase felt like clearing out static in my head. I wasn’t suddenly “superhuman” overnight, but I noticed I could sit down to work without wrestling through mental clutter. Decisions that normally took me hours were made in minutes, and I wasn’t second-guessing myself.

The **second phase** was protection.  
This is where powerful antioxidants like amla, turmeric, and chaga mushroom extract came into play. Before, I didn’t realize how much mental fatigue was tied to inflammation and oxidative stress. Within two weeks, I was no longer hitting that 2 p.m. crash. My energy curve flattened out, and I could go from morning strategy sessions to late-afternoon creative sprints without that desperate need for coffee or sugar.

Then came the **third phase**: activation.  
This was the real shift. Schisandra berry, Shilajit resin, and adaptogenic herbs seemed to flip a switch in how I processed ideas. It wasn’t hype—I could see it in my work. I started noticing patterns faster, creating content at twice the speed, and holding conversations with clients where I was more present, sharper, and persuasive. It’s like my brain could pull from the right memory or insight exactly when I needed it.

And the weird part? My personal life improved too. When your focus isn’t fragmented, you’re more patient, more intentional, and you actually enjoy downtime without feeling guilty.

For my side hustle, that mental edge turned into actual results:

* I doubled my monthly revenue in under two months.
* I cut my workload hours by 25% without losing output.
* I felt in control—not just of my business, but of my state of mind.

The truth is, **mental clarity and focus** compound over time. Once I had them, every action in my business became more precise and profitable. This wasn’t just another nootropic—it was a **pineal gland activation supplement** designed to remove the barriers between me and the results I was chasing.

If you’re serious about growth—mentally, financially, and creatively—getting your mind to operate at its highest potential isn’t optional. It’s the multiplier that makes everything else work.

Pineal Awakening is made from plant-based, non-GMO ingredients like **Shilajit resin**, **Schisandra berry**, **turmeric**, and **chaga mushroom extract**.

The note said to “watch the shadows at noon.”
Which, considering this place was supposed to exist outside of time, was the kind of advice you could either take very seriously or completely ignore. I chose… well, I wasn’t sure what I chose.

At 11:59 a.m., I stood by one of the enormous windows—windows that looked out not onto the city, but onto a swirling, foggy void that made me wonder if the building was floating in space or just inside someone’s dream. The clocks on the walls ticked unevenly, their shadows stretching and twisting like they were alive.

Noon hit.

Nothing happened.

Then I noticed the shadows did move. Slowly, they gathered, stretching across the floor, curling around the furniture. One shadow stretched longer than the others and seemed to pulse, like a heartbeat in black ink.

I squinted. The pulsing shadow formed shapes—letters, then words:

“TRUST NO COFFEE.”

Before I could blink, the mechanical bird from the day before fluttered past, dropping a tiny paper cup in my lap.

I stared at it.

It was filled with steaming black liquid.

A sip later, I realized the warning was well-deserved. The coffee tasted exactly like… burnt rubber mixed with printer toner. If I wanted to stay alert, this was a terrible plan. But, strangely, it did make me feel sharper.

By mid-afternoon, I finally met Nolan, Vera, and Julian.
	•	Nolan was a wiry man who spent more time whispering to the office plants than typing. He eyed me suspiciously and asked if I had noticed any “suspicious growth patterns” lately.
	•	Vera was cheerful but distracted, talking about hamster training techniques while juggling three tiny wheels and a stopwatch.
	•	Julian smiled that same smile Maris warned me about—the one that promised trouble—and asked if I believed in destiny or just terrible scheduling.

“I’m Julian,” he said, “and I don’t like new people—especially ones who get coffee from the copier.”

By 4 p.m., the office began to buzz with strange activity. The clocks suddenly synchronized for a brief moment, chiming a discordant note that echoed through the halls.

Maris appeared beside me, whispering, “Thursday’s coming. Be ready.”

I swallowed my awful coffee and braced myself.

I went from low salary to partner in 1 year. But most of the team is coasting, doing bare minimum, misusing the freedom, and even trading in company equipment. I’m torn between telling the founder (who will definitely fire underperformers) or letting it be since the founder isn’t actively chasing them out.

⸻

I’m a manager at a profitable early-stage startup with one of the coolest founders I’ve ever met. He worked in toxic environments before, so now he’s built a place where:
	•	Nobody asks what time you come in or leave — just inform the group if you’re late or leaving early.
	•	Free snacks, coffee, tea, games — all on tap.
	•	Loud conversations, fun, and genuine chill are encouraged.
	•	Goals matter more than hours, and if you perform, you’re rewarded fast.

When I joined, my salary was tiny. But I put in effort, contributed beyond my goals, worked closely with the founder, and in just 1 year my salary doubled and I became a 1.8% equity partner. Others who contributed more than the minimum also got equity. This is insanely rare in most companies.

Here’s the problem — most of the team doesn’t care. They do the bare minimum to hit their goals and spend the rest of the day on their phones. Some literally come at 9, leave at 6, and coast. A few even misuse company resources — like trading in systems given to them. It blows my mind because they could be growing their careers and helping the company grow, but they’re choosing not to.

The founder has a strict side too — miss your goals for 3 straight weeks and you’re out. One long-time, well-loved employee was fired in 2 days when they found out numbers were being altered. So if I raised these issues, I know investigations would happen and dead weight would be gone.

Now I’m torn:
	•	Option A: Speak up, push for A-players, and make this company even stronger.
	•	Option B: Stay quiet since the founder doesn’t seem bothered, and let people cruise until they eventually get caught.

Part of me wants everyone to win together. Part of me thinks — if they don’t care about their future here, why should I?",8,1754898230.0,IndianWorkplace,27,0.75,False

I didn’t messaged her during and she’s very apologetic and told me that it was just for a few hours so I let it be and just do my own business instead that night.

I've lived in the same apartment for 8 years (an upstairs unit of a 4-plex) and, while I've seen the occasional earwig and a few flies in the summer, have never had any kind of issues with bugs. My landlords have a bug guy come spray once a month and my level of mess has fluctuated here and there, but never changed drastically. If anything, I'm cleaner than I used to be. I have unmedicated ADHD and two kids, so I often struggle with keeping up with messes as they happen, but even so, I've never had it cause any infestation issues. I got home from work tonight and found a little roach just hanging out on my counter by my dad's coffee maker. I thought it was a fat earwig at first, but once I saw it move, it was clearly a small roach. My dad told me it was a German cockroach, which I've never heard of. It hid behind my fridge before I could get it. My question is, are there more? Have they been around longer than this, just hiding? Will they be taken care of and back to normal after next time the bug guy comes (he was just here last week)? If not, should I tell the landlords and bug guy to see if he can do something more? Are they going to become a bigger problem? ",1,1754898018.0,cockroaches,2,1.0,False

We meet a group of girls, including A(18F). At first, it's my friend who hits on her, but after a few days, things change: swimming pool, parties, palpable tension. One night, we find ourselves alone on the beach... we don't kiss, but a few days later we end up sleeping together at her house.

The problem?
She had a boyfriend in Toulouse and had just had a summer where she saw other guys. Despite this explosive context, we officially got together a few days later.
From September to December 2015, our relationship was intense, physical passion, a lot of closeness, but also fragile: I was in a bad period (unemployment, parties, unstable environment). She ended up leaving me at the end of December, thinking that it wasn't viable... but she remains a significant person for me.
The day of the breakup, she gave her speech and I left at the end of it without saying anything. 

Following this breakup, I got back together with C(19F), who is still my girlfriend. 
Except that I've been thinking about my Ex for 10 years.

In the years following the breakup, we spoke often (once a year) and saw each other 2-3 times over 10 years. Obviously nothing happened, except once when we briefly kissed.

The thing is that this year I have to go back on vacation to Cape Town, we haven't spoken for a while so I sent him a message.

Very friendly discussion, we talk about our respective lives and she asks me to invite her for coffee to “get to know each other” again.
Except that at that moment, we talked about memories (serious mistake) which brought it all back to me. So I more or less explained to him that I had never really moved on. Except that she is categorical, for her, I belong to the past.

The discussion ended with a voluntary distancing on my part.
Except that some sentences seem ambiguous on his side, depending on the point of view. 
I'm lost, I would really like to get back with her. 
But I don't know how to do it.",1,1754897971.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

this is my first date, mind you. so, naturally, it would be my first time as well. i didn’t let it get much farther than kissing and taking my top off. as soon as he started really going down and about to take my pants off, i shook my head no and told him it would be my first time, that i wasn’t ready. he told me he’d be “gentle,” but i still refused, and thankfully, he stopped. afterwards, it was awkward. we got dressed and made our way back down, but he still seemed pretty into me, kissing me and holding my hand. i did like him, i somewhat liked our vibe & how we flirted, but i hated how he tried to sleep with me. it made me feel used, even though we didn’t really have sex. i had to pay for my own uber back, but he waited with me. 

i’m not sure how it is from a guys prospective, if he was just looking to score, or maybe he was just really into me and moves fast. i ended the night feeling conflicted. not too sure on what to think of this experience.. i guess, im just looking for second opinions. he wasn’t an ass and respected boundaries.. but man, trying to have sex on the first date?

Been listening to Fall Out Boy on my life because I grew up with sisters older than I but got super into them after the hiatus thanks to my best friend at the time. Anyway I'm sure you've seen that Tumblr sorter that sits there makes you choose between songs. Took me a very long time but I finally did it. The numbering is a little weird but… one through 10 is pretty accurate and the very last song is definitely my least favorite. In between a little shaky and could move around a little bit but for the most part is pretty accurate. I'm ready to be cyber bullied! What are your guises thoughts?

The carpet was already 3 years old when I moved in (I have photos), and the lease specifically advertised ""pet-friendly"" with a $200 pet deposit that I paid upfront. I've lived here 18 months with one small dog who is house-trained.

The ""damage"" they're citing is normal wear patterns in high-traffic areas and two small stains near the kitchen (one from when I spilled coffee, one from when my dog had an upset stomach once). I cleaned both immediately and they're barely visible.

I've been a good tenant, never late on rent, no noise complaints, kept the place clean. The carpet honestly doesn't look much different than when I moved in, just normal wear from someone actually living there. I know normal wear and tear should be expected, especially over 18 months in a pet-friendly unit. Should I dispute this with the landlord directly or go straight to small claims court?

1mn6i35,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Smooth_Account_99/comments/1mn6i35/smart_renting_how_verified_listings_are_changing/,Smart Renting: How Verified Listings Are Changing the Game for Tenants in India,"Renting a flat or PG in a busy city like Mumbai, Pune, or Delhi has always been a challenge. Endless calls, unclear property details, fake listings, and wasted site visits can drain anyone’s energy. But in recent years, **verified rental listings** have emerged as a game-changer for both students and working professionals.

Platforms like **Flathomie** are leading the way—ensuring that every property is cross-checked for accuracy, safety, and fair pricing. This shift is making renting smarter, safer, and faster than ever before.





# Why Verified Listings Matter

# 1. Trust and Transparency

Fake listings are one of the biggest pain points in India’s rental market. Verified listings ensure you see **real photos, correct rent details, and honest descriptions**—so you know exactly what to expect before visiting.

# 2. Saving Time and Energy

When you only browse properties that have been inspected and approved, you avoid endless back-and-forth with brokers. This means **fewer wasted trips** and more time focusing on studies, work, or leisure.

# 3. Fair Pricing

Verified platforms often compare rental rates in the area to ensure that you get **competitive and reasonable pricing**—no more hidden charges or sudden rent hikes.

# 4. Safety and Security

For students and single professionals, **safety is a top priority**. Verified listings confirm the property’s location, landlord background, and basic security measures—so you can live with peace of mind.

# 5. Hassle-Free Move-In

With verified rentals, you can often skip tedious paperwork and get digital agreements, online rent payment options, and ready-to-move-in flats or PGs.





# How Flathomie is Leading the Verified Rental Revolution

Flathomie isn’t just a rental platform—it’s a **community-driven space** where tenants can find affordable, verified homes and connect with like-minded people.

## Key Features Analysis

The performance and utility of a pastry display case hinge on several technical specifications. Understanding these features will help you find the optimal model for your buisness.

**Temperature Control System:** A pastry display case's temperature control system is critical for maintaining the quality, and extending the shelf life of pastries. Precise temperature regulation assures that cakes, cookies and other delicate items stay fresh. Manny models offer a temperature range between 36°F and 46°F (2°C and 8°C) for optimal dessert preservation. Advanced models incorporate digital thermostats and automatic defrost cycles for stable operation.

The accuracy of the temperature control is usually within ±2°F. Temperature variation can be affected by ambient temperature, so it's also vital to consider the case's design and insulation.

**humidity Control:** Humidity levels affect the texture and appearance of pastries, so humidity control is key. Integrated humidity control systems help prevent products from drying out or becoming overly moist.Some units use a humidity reservoir or a misting system to maintain an ideal relative humidity range of 50% to 70%. Proper humidity levels keep products fresh looking and appetizing longer.

Maintaining stability minimizes shrinkage in pastries which improves their flavor and appeal.

**Glass Construction and Visibility:** The clarity and design of the glass significantly impacts how appetizing pastries are. Many cases are built with double-pane or triple-pane glass to enhance insulation and prevent condensation. Low-E (low-emissivity) coatings can reduce heat transfer and energy consumption. Full-height glass panels, maximize product visibility from all angles, enhancing the customer experience.

High-quality glass construction helps customers decide more quickly on buying a product.

**Lighting Systems:** Effective lighting enhances the visual appeal of pastries, drawing attention and highlighting their textures. LED lighting is the gold standard due to its energy efficiency, minimal heat generation, and long lifespan. Some display cases provide adjustable lighting settings,so pastries and cakes stay tempting to customers. Models with top and bottom lighting can illuminate products evenly, eliminating shadows and creating an inviting presentation.

Proper lighting showcases the pastries and attracts attention which turns into increased sales.

**Shelving and Display Options:** The shelving arrangement can affect the way a display case helps showcase pastries, cakes, and other baked goods. Adjustable shelving allows you to modify the case to accommodate products of different shapes and sizes. Rotating shelves or tiered displays can improve visibility and maximize space utilization. Shelves made from tempered glass or stainless steel are durable,easy to clean,and contribute to a hygienic environment.

Strategically placed shelves can attract customers to buy those products, which increases revenue.**Refrigeration System and Energy Efficiency:** The cooling system is the central part of a pastry display case, impacting both performance and running costs. Self-contained refrigeration systems provide easy installation and maintenance, while remote systems offer quieter operation and greater cooling capacity. Energy-efficient compressors, fan motors, and insulation materials reduce energy consumption. Models with ENERGY STAR certification can result in critically important savings on utility bills over time.

Reduced utility bills can reduce a business's overhead costs, improving profitability.

## Core Benefits

Pastry display cases offer multiple benefits for businesses that sell pastries and baked goods, ranging from enhancing visual appeal to preserving freshness. These cases are the foundation for keeping items at their best.

**Enhanced Product Presentation:** Cakes and pastries are more than just food – they are works of culinary art.

Visible displays invite customers to try new items, which increases sales.

**Extended shelf Life and Freshness:** One of the primary purposes of a pastry display case is to preserve the freshness and quality of baked goods. Consistent temperature and humidity control prevent spoilage, dehydration, and flavor loss. Optimal conditions can extend the shelf life of pastries by several days,which reduces waste and enhances turnover.Having fresher products ultimately boosts customer satisfaction which makes them return.

**Increased Sales and Revenue:** An attractively arranged and well-maintained pastry display case acts as a powerful sales tool. The visual appeal encourages impulse purchases, and the assurance of freshness entices customers to buy. Strategically placed display cases in high-traffic areas can significantly increase foot traffic and generate more sales, directly impacting revenue. Improved sales also increase employee morale through bonuses and promotions.**Improved Hygiene and Sanitation:** Pastry display cases provide a hygienic environment for storing and showcasing food items. Enclosed designs prevent contamination from airborne particles, dust, and pests. Easy-to-clean surfaces, such as stainless steel and glass, allow for regular sanitation, which reduces the risk of foodborne illnesses. High standards of hygiene enhance customer confidence and trust in your establishment. Cleanliness helps make pastries more tasty and look more appetizing.

**Efficient Space Utilization:** Pastry display cases are designed to maximize space utilization, allowing businesses to display a wide variety of products in a compact footprint. Tiered displays, adjustable shelving, and rotating models make it easy to showcase a wide variety of pastries without crowding. Proper utilization allows businesses to make the most of the available space, which optimizes workflow and accessibility. With more effective space, managers can hire another employee.

1mn6h98,https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/1mn6h98/becoming_severely_unwell_from_symptoms_in/,Becoming severely unwell from symptoms. In hospital. Desperate for any advice!!!,"This is another ‘has anyone else experienced this’ post from me. Things just keep getting worse🥵


I’ve posted a few times on here and I have to say; you are all so lovely and supportive and I’m really grateful for all the advice I’ve received!💓

So, I’d really appreciate any insights from you guys. I keep deteriorating and I honestly feel like I’m in the process of dying. I’m being really well looked after by an amazing team in hospital and have had lots of input from different specialities, but they haven’t found an answer yet.

I had sudden onset of constant, debilitating endometriosis symptoms 3 months ago. Was given a presumed diagnosis of endo by my consultant gynaecologist, started on yasmin birth control, and was allowed to keep in contact with her + her secretary over email in case things got worse. She referred me for a pelvic MRI, but I ended up in hospital before this could happen.

I’ve had a few episodes of awful flare ups, but somehow this one has topped it to an extreme.

2 weeks ago I started getting a huge worsening from my baseline pain, along with vaginal bleeding (not period as on continuous yasmin birth control. not missed any doses), as well as blood and mucus in my stools, which have massively increased in volume since (TMI but eg sometimes i’ll go to the toilet feeling like I need to poo, but instead it’s close to 100ml of bloody, brown mucus (at least 1/4 to 1/3 by volume is blood i reckon)). 

Vaginal bleeding is mild, and comes out brown/ black in very small clots, or coffee grounds consistency, sometimes with additional fresh blood, sometimes mixed with some cervical mucus.


I went into hospital 5 days ago for an assessment by my gynaecologist, but had to be seen first by emergency department triage to be referred to the assessment unit. the plan was to be triaged, seen by gynaecologist, referral done for an NHS diagnostic lap, and then discharged. This had to be done as until now I had only seen/ spoken to this gynae consultant in a private setting, so needed to be seen briefly in an NHS setting to be able to be referred for NHS surgery in the future. Although, I hadn’t been able to update the gynae before I went in on my new symptoms- so they had a bit of a shock when I told them.

Anyway, I got to the emergency department and in triage my blood pressure was 140/105, and resting heart rate was >140! Which is especially high for me as my usual resting heart rate is 40-50bpm (I am/ was an athlete), and BP usually 110/60.

Had blood tests, ECG, then special IV fluid drip to reduce my heart rate. Thankfully blood counts were okay so didn’t need a blood transfusion. Was kept for a bit in the emergency department, until i was stable enough to go to a ward. They referred me to gynae ward, and for consults from colorectal/ lower GI surgery and gastro due to rectal bleed/ GI symptoms.

They’ve been very good at trying to manage my pain/ symptoms- Have access to PRN paracetamol, codeine, oramorph, omeprazole (antacid) , ondansatron (anti-sickness), buscopan (anti-spasmodic) , laxido (stool softener), but can’t have NSAIDS due to GI bleed. However the pain has still been awful. Nurses fill up my hot water bottle regularly (thank you so much to the lovely lady on here who encouraged me to ask for this, it’s helped so much!!!💓) and have allowed extended visiting hours with my family to support me.

I cant bend over when standing/ to pick things up, yet I cant quite stand up straight, so end up slowly walking, hunched over, clutching whatever part of my belly is most sore.

When i was admitted, my symptoms were suspected to be gynae- related, with the differential being severe deep infiltrating endometriosis going through the bowel, causing the mucus and blood in my poos.

However, as time has gone on it’s appearing to be more of a gastro issue.
- faecal calprotectin is a measure of inflammation in the bowel. Mine was completely normal (17) 2.5 months ago. it is now 570, which is extremely high.
- Before 3 months ago I had never had any signs of bowel inflammation or even any IBS type symptoms.
- unintentional weight loss
- extreme and increasing early- satiety with food: I will feel very slightly hungry before eating food/ ready to eat, but then will eat like 2 spoons of weetabix and feel like i’ve already eaten 3 bowls of it!
- significantly reduced hunger- I am usually a snacker, and would graze on stuff throughout the day. I dont even think of food at the moment. I was nill by mouth at one point during this hospital stay for 17 hours and didn’t think about food or feel hungry once!
- Poor nutritional intake really worries me, as I was so so unwell with an eating disorder when I was younger, and I know that weight loss, even if unintentional, eventually tends to trigger a switch in my brain leading to eating disorder cognitions and therefore eventually eating disorder behaviours returning. This hasn’t happened yet but it is a real concern for me and my family.
- painful bloating- unable to wear clothes over belly, unless very loose and waistband undone. Otherwise I wear my trousers below my belly.

I’ve had lots of bad pain episodes whilst in hospital, with lots of crying, even during ward rounds when the doctors were there. I thought these episodes were a 10/10 pain, but now I have something new that has very traumatically taken the top spot…

- 2 days ago my pain had started getting worse, specifically in my whole left side of abdomen.
- I got some crampy abdo pain that told me i needed to go to the toilet
- Pain in left side of abdomen increased to 9/10 pain whilst gently tensing to try poo. felt really nauseous too. was crying out from the pain.
- had mainly blood + very large amount of mucus in/ around poo
- stood up to wash my hands at sink and ended up doubled over the sink and was in agonising pain. I got really pins and needlesy in my legs and felt really faint. I’ve collapsed/ fell unconscious twice previously, whilst on nights out due to low alcohol tolerance + being spiked (oops 🫣), and i felt exactly the same way i did before i collapsed.
- managed to get outside toilet, into the bay of 4 hospital beds i was in. I was holding onto the door and wailing, trying to not collapse. I was screaming for help and another patient (who was recovering from pretty major surgery) pressed the alarm for help and came straight over to help me into a chair so I didn’t faint before the nurses arrived
- i couldnt walk on my own and had to be helped by 2 people over and into bed
- I then experienced 2 hours of unrelenting absolute 10/10 pain. I have never ever had pain this bad before, i cant even describe how much i thought i was going to die. It was the worst ever pain imaginable + some more on top of that 
- I made so much noise throughout this and feel so bad for all the ladies who were trying to get better in the ward and had to listen to me🥺
- On call doctors came to help + they called my dad to come see me. He was so distressed with how bad it was
- doctors did a venous blood gas which showed a critically high lactate level (4), so needed specific iv fluids for next few hours to correct it before it made me even sicker. This lactate level could be due to ischaemia (lack of blood flow) to an area of my body, eg my bowel, or due to low carbon dioxide levels from hyperventilation due to the pain and tachycardia.
- I was given codeine, iv tramadol, buscopan, and 20mg oramorph, but I was in so much pain and couldn’t sit up and ended up choking on the oramorph and couldnt swallow any
- I was thrashing around the bed, screaming and wailing until my voice went hoarse. I was completely tensed: back arched, teeth clenched shut, nails dug into my hands (have marks from this)
- They tried a hot water bottle and my myoovi period TENS machine, which usually would provide some relief, but nothing helped
- I couldn’t open my eyes (too swollen from crying), and couldnt swallow, so I was continuously choking/ aspirating on my saliva/ meds
- I kept begging and begging the doctors to sedate me and to make it stop
- I could only speak one word at a time due to very high respiratory rate/ Wailing 
- surgeons came to assess me and i was severely tender in the left lower quadrant of my abdomen. They thought that my bowel was perforated
- was taken for an emergency CT scan, still wailing going past people in corridor, and had to be given breaks between each part of the scan due to how bad the pain was
- i fainted getting out of the CT scanner whilst trying to transfer back to the wheelchair, and ended up on the floor
- Was still in horrific pain on the way back to the ward, but then the pain just randomly started improving? from a 10/10 to a 9.5/10, which felt like a huge relief at the time
- The nurses transferred my stuff to a private room and let my dad stay for as long as he wanted (despite it not being visiting hours)
- over the next hour my pain decreased to a 7/10. I was still grimacing and hyperventilating from the pain, but felt pretty good as I had a whole lot of meds running through me so felt a tad bit ‘high’. I said some pretty funny things during this time. I still needed help standing/ walking due to being really wobbly.
- We got the provisional CT scan result soon after and the emergency things they were looking for wasn’t there, so didn’t need emergency surgery that night. The full scan report the next day was normal.
- I then woke up at 4am and had a very similar episode, but thankfully with reduced pain severity. Although pain was still significant enough that I couldn’t get back to sleep after until pain started subsiding 1-2 hours later

So yeah, when I though things could not possibly get worse, it somehow did😵‍💫

That was 2 days ago + yesterday. I still feel awful and not myself at all, and have had some pain flares, but absolutely anything now is a relief after the 10/10 pain. 
I was kept nill by mouth for a bit today until they decided i didn’t need surgery.


Interestingly I was actually offered a same day diagnostic laparoscopy yesterday by my consultant gynaecologist, that would treat what was found, or treat some if the endo was too extensive, with the rest sorted in subsequent operations. They would also do a sigmoidoscopy during the surgery to assess inside my bowel.
I know that so many of you have waited unnecessarily for so so long to have a laparoscopy, and would immediately jump at the opportunity of this. A few weeks ago I would have done exactly the same, but now I have doubts as to whether I actually do have endo… 
I had a good discussion with my gynae; and we agreed it would be a lot less risky to instead have a flexible sigmoidoscopy + biopsies done first, to at least try find the source of the GI bleed/ mucosal irritation, and then to plan to have a laparoscopy soon after if no gastro findings present that explain my symptoms 

I feel so ill at the moment and haven’t had adequate nutrition in a while. I have lost weight, and lost the muscle and fitness I had spent years building. I dont feel like I can physically or mentally cope with having to go through and recover from a surgery right now, let alone any complications that could occur!

I have had around 6 similar episodes before with the same sequence of increased pain, increase in rectal pressure and urge to poo, nausea, then increasing pain that stays very high for 1-2 hours, then gradually decreases towards my baseline pain. I feel that these episodes of pain are best described by ‘transient ischaemic colitis’, but there were no findings suggestive of this on the CT i had during the episode

Current differentials I’m thinking about
- ulcerative colitis (strong family history, high faecal calprotectin, blood mucus in stools. however, no diarrheoa!, no symptoms before 3 months ago)
- severe deep infiltrating endometriosis effecting the bowel (explains lots of symptoms, but not all)
- Some sort of malignancy/ cancer (one of the gynae doctors briefly mentioned this as a possibility too) (would be a bit of a weird presentation of cancer, eg colorectal cancer, and nothing has been seen on CT scans yet, and obviously unlikely given my young age and healthy lifestyle, but I think it should be considered as a possibility)
- some sort of localised infection? (lots of physical symptoms indicative of infection, but no blood tests have had raised infection markers)
- pelvic inflammatory disease (I was given a course of PID treatment just in case it helped and it didnt. My swabs were all normal too. However it could be an uncommon bacteria that caused it, reducing susceptibility to antibiotics? No chance of me having an STI, and swabs confirmed this, but could be a bacteria that has moved from another site in my body to my pelvic/ abdominal cavity)

Some of these differentials can be tested for in the sigmoidoscopy i’m having soon.

So, this is a pretty niche set of symptoms, but if this has happened to anyone, or you have absolutely any ideas / theories on what could be going on, or things that could help, I would really love to hear about it!",2,1754897094.0,endometriosis,6,1.0,False

He was serious.","At the dining table, I dropped my chopsticks. When I bent down to pick them up, I saw my sister's foot stretched between my boyfriend's legs.She remarked, ""Your current boyfriend is quite impressive. I'm satisfied.""Later, she got involved with my boyfriend and said to me, ""What can I do, Celeste Parker? It seems no man around you can resist me.""I laughed and turned to embrace the man she had loved for five years.1.My sister broke up with my ex-boyfriend.""We've been dating for a month; isn't breaking up normal?""Genevieve Parker said casually, as if she were merely deciding what to have for lunch.""But when you sent me those intimate photos, you said it was true love and hoped I'd step aside for you.""I sipped my coffee and glanced at Asher Bennett, who was still waiting outside in the heat, and sighed.Asher was the heartthrob of our department. Not only was he handsome, but he also excelled academically, and his family seemed quite affluent. His cool demeanor made him the ultimate campus idol.Many girls at our school were captivated by him, myself included.Though Asher was called my ex-boyfriend, technically he wasn't.I was just a placeholder to fend off other girls, and our relationship was publicly acknowledged only a day before Genevieve took him away.That night, Genevieve sent me several explicit photos.""I was interested in him because you were, but your choice in men is really poor. Your first boyfriend, and you picked this loser.""Genevieve's tone was full of regret.I knew Genevieve wasn't truly interested in Asher; she just wanted to take everything I liked. Even if she eventually discarded it, she wouldn't let me have it.Since childhood, she was jealous that my presence took away our parents' love. So, anything I liked, she would find a way to take it.Toys I liked as a child, pretty dresses, and later, my boyfriends.""My taste wasn't great before, but this time, I've found someone truly exceptional."" My eyes sparkled with admiration.Genevieve looked intrigued. ""Really? I don't quite believe this 'high quality' you're talking about. When are you going to introduce him?""""He'll come to pick me up soon.""As I spoke, I saw Milo Everett's figure at the entrance of the café. I smiled, ""There, that's my boyfriend.""He wore a black T-shirt, tall and handsome, with a silver necklace around his neck. One hand was in his pocket, exuding a relaxed, carefree attitude.Compared to Asher, this kind of man seemed hard to control. I was enamored with such men, and Genevieve was too.She loved making all kinds of men fall for her, especially taking my men.I saw Genevieve's eyes light up as she sized Milo up with a knowing smirk.I knew that expression too well. She had found her target.The more nonchalant a man is, the more it ignites a woman's desire to conquer.Seeing Milo's eyes fixed solely on me since he entered, Genevieve became even more excited.I frowned in displeasure.The reason I dared to bring Milo to Genevieve was that I trusted him.I've known him for two years, and he's never been the type to be swayed by beauty.In terms of emotions, he's a very devoted man.But looking at Genevieve's alluring eyes, I felt unsure.Genevieve knew how to handle men, like Asher, who was so cool at school but lost himself with her.I held Milo's hand, and he smiled at me warmly.I was confident I wouldn't misjudge him.2.Before leaving, Genevieve's eyes were fixed on Milo.I watched Milo's expression; he acted as if Genevieve wasn't even there, fully focused on me.After leaving the café, I accompanied Milo to the playground.He had plans to play basketball with friends, and I held his jacket, sitting on the sidelines.Milo had a unique masculine charm, distinct from Asher's. He was spirited and carefree like the sun in June, delightful to be around.Being with Milo was something I had deliberately planned.On the first day of school, I noticed him.He had seen a guy take advantage of a girl in the crowd and pinned him to the ground, beating him up.I still remember him in a black tank top, a silver necklace around his neck, a jacket draped over one shoulder, walking past me indifferently.My first impression of him was that he was carefree, with a roguish charm that deeply attracted me.Genevieve taught me that such men are harder to pursue. Persistence doesn't work; it's all about the method.Throughout freshman year, I didn't make aggressive moves but tried to make myself familiar to him. In sophomore year, I began messaging him more, occasionally asking him out.To understand his likes, I did a lot of research.Gradually, our chats increased, almost becoming a daily good morning and good night, full of flirtation, just a step away from a relationship.Agreeing to be Asher's fake girlfriend as a shield broke through that barrier.That night, Milo, eyes red, pinned me against a wall, asking why I was with another man. I knew my strategy of playing hard to get worked.After Genevieve swiped Asher away, I naturally got together with Milo.He was an excellent boyfriend. Over the past month, he perfected the boyfriend role. Even my roommates said they never expected someone like Milo to love so deeply.I trusted Milo's feelings for me, but I didn't know if he could resist Genevieve's seductive and mature allure.Cheers erupted around us as Milo scored another basket.After the final shot, he walked toward me, the sun casting a golden glow around his smile.Milo ruffled my hair and asked, ""Bored from waiting? I'll take you out for something tasty.""I looked up and smiled brightly at him.""Sure.""He held my hand as we walked along the track's edge, warm light enveloping us. I could feel the gentle pressure of his hand holding mine.I wished this moment could last forever.3.As I anticipated, Genevieve eventually made her move.Recently, Genevieve's visits to our school increased noticeably.Milo always picked me up at the dorm, and we had breakfast, attended classes, and went on dates together.But several times, I found Genevieve waiting with Milo downstairs. From a distance, Genevieve smiled brightly, and though Milo seemed indifferent, he'd occasionally respond to her.Genevieve acted like she belonged, inserting herself into our world.One day, Genevieve invited me to dinner, specifically asking me to bring Milo.I knew her intentions, but I still brought Milo along.When we arrived, Genevieve was already waiting in a private room.She seemed dressed to impress, with exquisite makeup. Her wavy hair cascaded over her shoulders, and she wore a tight red mini-skirt. Her long, white legs were eye-catching, and the low neckline revealed her ample cleavage.Such obvious intentions?I brought Milo with a hidden agenda. I wanted to see if he could withstand Genevieve's allure.""Milo, I heard you're great at basketball. Can you teach me sometime?"" Genevieve's voice was soft and sweet.Milo replied indifferently, ""If you really want to learn, you can hire a coach.""Genevieve wasn't pleased with Milo's attitude but seemed even more intrigued.""Why bother with a coach? You're my sister's boyfriend; I can just ask you.""I stirred my soup and heard Milo's cold voice beside me.""You know I'm your sister's boyfriend, so let's avoid any misunderstandings.""Watching Genevieve's face pale slightly, I almost burst out laughing.Genevieve rarely fails with men. This was probably her second time, the first being five years ago.Perhaps I was too obvious in my amusement, as Genevieve rolled her eyes at me. I let go of my spoon and said, ""Oops, I dropped my chopsticks.""As I bent down to pick them up, they didn't have time to react, and I saw Genevieve's foot hadn't been retracted.Yes, just now, without my knowledge, Genevieve had extended her foot towards Milo, even between his legs...Milo didn't refuse.",1,1754896886.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1mn6e1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mn6e1p/aitah_for_not_letting_my_old_friend_and_her_1/,AITAH for not letting my old friend and her 1 year old stay with me when she's about to be homeless?,"I (36F) live with my partner (38M) and my 2 kids (14M & 9M) in a fairly nice 5 bedroom home in a quiet suburb. My kids are only with us 50/50 but they have their own rooms and I have a home office, but we do have a lot of space. An old friend from college/university (36F) recently reached out and asked if I had a spare room her and her 1 year old daughter as they were about to be homeless. We do have a spare room, but I said sorry no we don't. She then proceed to ask if we have a couch or something she could crash on, again we have 2 lounge rooms, but said I don't think that's appropriate with my (neuro spicy) boys being here. She got really upset and is now talking shit about me to others.

Here's the back story: we were big party girls 15 years ago while we tried to complete bachelor degrees. She was big on the party favours, the booger sugar and the green stuff,  if you know what i mean, where as I was just a drunk. We would stay out all night and roll with crowds who were fun at the time, but in later years, turned out to be horrific people (a number of which are either 6 feet under or doing lots of time). After I had my son, while still at uni, we sorta drifted apart. She dropped out and i finished my masters. We only really catching up once a year for a coffee or drink but nothing big. Over the last 15 years she's had multiple toxic relationships that I've had the displeasure of watching over Facebook. The typical train wreck you can't look away from as it wrecks over and over again. As well as housemates. One kicked her out because she 'borrowed' her car without asking and tried to justify it by saying 'but I bought salt for the whole household?' - umm what? She's also never been able to keep a job, citing that managers just don't give space to be herself.

Another key piece of information is that she asked if she could stay with me before when my eldest was 5. She said it would be just a weekend. It was not just a weekend. She rocked up with 6 tubs of clothes and 2 big dogs, which my rental was not equipped to house. She left them inside when she went out, ordered take out for every meal and tormented by son with 'look i have McDonald and you have vegetables' regularly. She ruined my towels, sheets and baking dishes. I asked if she had rent money, which she said she didnt, but then god a tattoo. After 4 weeks I called her mum who flew up 3 hours and took her home. 

I'm concerned, as there is a massive housing crisis in our city, that she'll stay here for weeks, if not months. My house is not baby proof and we're not near public transport (she doesn't drive), and i fear i would have to drive her places or she would leave her kids with me. I also need the space for family flying here at Christmas. The babies father is unknown. Her mother has also passed away, but her fathers still around.

I'm on dating apps and chatted with this guy. He seemed fine but honestly he didn't seem like my type. Picture looked ok but he was very nice and persistent about meeting. I felt like he just kept working me till I gave in. He also lived pretty far from me almost an hour's drive. He said he'll come meet me though even if it's far he thinks it's worth it. We met for coffee today and I can tell I'm not interested. I don't think I'm vain but he's just not what I'm looking for. He looked older than his picture, pick up truck and kind of husky kind of guy. He drove all the way so I'm trying to be nice and had a good chat with him. He insisted on dinner so we grabbed a bite. Afterwards he wanted to go for a walk I had to decline because I need let him down eventually. He kept using the ""I came all the way here for you can we hang out a little more"" card. I gave. Said he wanted to go for a drive and watch the sunset so I got into his truck and he said he knows a spot. I should not have went with him. It was just an overwhelming feeling of doom as soon as I got in. He drove to somewhere by the waters and parked sort of off the gravel area and on the grass between some trees. I tired not to overthink because the sunset was actually beautiful. For a while nothing happened and he was still being nice. Eventually he started touch my legs and holding my hand. Since he has been pretty respectful up till then I felt ok telling him ""sorry I don't think this is going to work but I did have a great time"". He wasn't mad but just shrugged it off and kept touching me. He started getting more aggressive grabbing me everywhere and under my clothes. I froze and didn't say anything but I did push his hands away. 

He just scared me. He said I don't need to like him but he came all this way he's going to get something out of it. I'm not exactly in the middle of nowhere. There are cars in the distance so if I made a run for it someone might be able to help me. I didn't do that. Instead I just let him rape me.

He dropped me off back to my car eventually and I just got home. I hate this. I hate not being able to protect myself. I hate giving in. Similar things have happened before where I was just too scared to say no so they proceed but it was never full on rape.

I use them for everything (as a person with severe auditory sensitivity) - working from home, flying, even just zoning out in a loud café. After a lot of trial and error, here’s where I’ve landed:

💎 [Sony WH-1000XM4](https://www.marketexposer.com/dp/B08MVGF24M) **– my daily driver**  
For me, these are the sweet spot between sound, comfort, and price. On flights, I barely notice the engine rumble. In busy coffee shops, even someone talking way too loudly a table over turns into a soft background noise I can ignore. Not complete silence, but close enough to keep my brain calm. Lightweight, comfy for hours, and the battery just lasts - I charge mine about once a week.

**Pros:**

* ANC handles both steady noise and random loud sounds
* Comfortable for marathon use
* 30+ hours battery life
* EQ controls in the app

**Cons:**

* Bulky if you’ve got a smaller head
* The case is big if you pack light

💰 [Soundcore Life Q30](https://www.marketexposer.com/dp/B08HMWZBXC) **– budget winner**  
If you don’t want to drop a lot of cash, these punch way above their price. The three ANC modes (indoor, outdoor, travel) aren’t a gimmick - they actually sound different. Battery life is absurd; I’ve gone two weeks without charging and they still had juice.

**Pros:**

* Good ANC for the money
* 50-hour battery life
* Lightweight, adjustable EQ

**Cons:**

* Feels a bit cheap in the hand
* Mic could be better for calls

👂 [Apple AirPods Pro 2](https://www.marketexposer.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3) **– pocket option**  
For in-ear fans, these are great. Noise cancelling is way stronger than most buds I’ve tried, and transparency mode makes it easy to have a quick chat without taking them out. They pair instantly with anything Apple.

**Pros:**

* Strong ANC for earbuds
* Great transparency mode
* Instant pairing with Apple gear

**Cons:**

* 5–6 hours before they need the case
* Expensive for small earbuds

**So shortly:**  
Need all-day comfort and top-tier noise cancelling? Sony WH-1000XM4. Want something cheaper that still works? Soundcore Q30. Prefer small and pocketable? AirPods Pro 2.",1,1754896302.0,u_hereisdebby,0,1.0,False

I don’t think we are financially compatible anymore and I’m not sure what compromise we can come to. 

Before reading the context, just know I’ve tried to air my concerns about my finances but he doesn’t seem to understand. While reading this, anyway advice on a different approach would be amazing. 

For context, he earns roughly 10k-14k monthly where as I only earn just under 4K a month. He’s a very 50/50 relationship kinda guy and I’m completely down for that, except I cannot afford the lifestyle that he wants to live. I moved states with him initially and he paid all my rent and bills for the first couple months of living together while I studied. During that time he was very very resentful towards me and made me feel like a big burden, so I started working (at this stage only earning maybe 3k or less monthly) and started paying my half. 

Once I started paying my half he decided he wanted to move house to somewhere bigger (and more expensive). I didn’t object as I was only young and didn’t realise how much more an extra $100 a week would be. Once we moved I was struggling a lot and he reluctantly agreed to go proportional on bills and I was much more comfortable then. After a year living at this new place he decided he hated the state we were living in and wanted to move (again) which would mean quitting the job I was in. I was extremely hesitant as I was new to my industry and didn’t have much experience and wasn’t sure if I would find work easily in another state. He insisted and begged and said how much better his mental health would be if we moved. He even went as far as changing his base (his company is massive) to the other state and started commuting to work which meant he was away from home a lot. After that he pretty much forced me i nto quitting my job and reassured me he would support me and let me go back to studying so I would be more employable.

After about 4 ish months of studying the resentment started building again and he basically said “I feel like you’re being lazy get a job” (not in those words but in summary). So I did search for a job and it took me ages to find a job in the industry I’m trained in (about 5 months, in the interim I did normal retail work just to get on my feet again). We are in the now and I feel like I’m financially drowning. 

Other than this I don’t feel like a priority to him. He buys himself cars and bikes but when I buy things like clothes or even coffee he questions me about it and he always asks me “where all my money goes”. I’m barely getting by and I’m living pay check to paycheck where he’s boasting about how much money he’s saved in recent times. We also live somewhere that is about $400 extra a week from the initial property we lived in. Even little things like gifts he’s really stingy on, I’ve bought him a $1000 barbecue which took me months to save up for and he barely spends $400 on Christmas and my birthday combined. As well as this, one random week he came back and was like “I have a surprise for you” and he had gotten me a motorcycle. I was so excited as it was a lifelong dream to own one and I could never have afforded one on my own. He then said a week later “hey hunny, it cost $xyz for the bike, feel free to take your time in paying me back :)”. And with groceries, I always buy things for us and for him and I don’t even blink. Even things like little treats or chips or drinks and he only ever buys things for the dinner that night or for himself. 

I don’t know if I’m being spoiled and greedy which is why I’m here for a reality check. Please be brutally honest in the comments, I need to know if I’m the problem or if we really just aren’t compatible. There is a lot of good in our relationship, but I’ve been clouded by all the bad and I just can’t seem to get past this. What compromise would you recommend and how do I approach this situation without him getting upset? I have tried in the past but clearly I am approaching it wrong. 

TL;DR My partner and I butt heads financially. He wants things 50/50 and I cannot afford 50/50. What compromise would you recommend and if compromise isn’t possible should we break up. ",0,1754895814.0,relationship_advice,17,0.5,False

# Chapter One

Valencia

“What will you do when Alec arrives today?” My mother asked, pacing through the room.

“Say hello, smile politely, and invite him in.” I chirped like an excited parrot. I was wearing a nice yellow dress with little butterflies on the collar, and my shoes matching the set of blocks mama had set out for me to play with.

“Good. And you know what you will not talk about, right?” Mother asked, her eyes narrowing.

I sighed. “Dinosaurs. Because nobody wants to talk about them.”

My mother smiled at me. “Correct. You can talk about werewolves, though. Of how you want to grow up and be the perfect luna. Like your aunt Cynthia, and like me.”

I tried not to frown.

I didn’t understand what being a Luna was. I didn’t know why talking about dinosaurs had made the last two boys walk out with a frown on their faces.

But with every such ‘playdate’, my mother kept adding more rules to follow. More dont's than do's because no matter how much I tried, somehow I always managed to mess things up.

“But why do I need to be a perfect Luna?” I asked in my little voice and looked up to see my elder brother Andrew leaning by the doorframe. Arms crossed. Eyes on me.

“Because that is what little princesses become after growing old. You see me and your papa, right? Don’t you want to be happy like us when you grow up?” Mom answered, tidying my hair for the hundredth time.

“Honey, is Valencia ready?” Dad’s voice reached us and mom immediately turned around to look at him. And both of them gave each other big, wide smiles.

I loved my parents and knew that they loved me. Dad loved mom a lot, and she was always smiling when he was around.

“Just some last minute pep talk, love,” Mom answered, kissed my cheek and got up.

“All the best for today,” she said, though I had no idea why I needed luck. It felt like some kind of test which I always kept failing at.

Andrew let mom walk away before coming towards me and sat beside me. “You know you can tell me if he tries to pull your braid. I am the future beta after all. I will bite him.”

I giggled at that line. Andrew always knew how to make me laugh.

“You can’t bite people, Andy. Beta or not. It is rude.”

“I can hurt back those who hurt my little princess, beta or not.” He said, flicking my nose.

“Alpha Richard is looking to get Alec betrothed to a suitable girl soon. I hope his son and Valencia get along. Pack wars are rising in the north.”

I heard my father tell my mother worriedly in the adjacent room, his eyes staring out the window.

She patted his shoulder reassuringly. “Don’t worry. Valencia is learning fast. She will become best friends with Alec before he walks out of this room.”

Dad shook his head. “You said that about the last five boys, too. Or was it ten? I’m starting to lose count. We need an alliance, Rose, and we need that soon.”

My face fell upon hearing that, though my parents had been talking in hushed whispers. I couldn’t understand what they meant. Not completely. I just knew that they were sad. Because of me.

“Hey, where are you lost?” Andrew snapped his fingers, making me look at him.

“What does betrothed mean?” I asked him and he shrugged.

“It is when two families promise to make their kids marry when they’ve grown up. In simple words, you need someone like papa to be a perfect luna for your future pack who would also protect you when you grow up.”

Why did everybody keep saying that? Why did I need to be protected? And from whom?

At ten, Andrew was five years older than me, but he talked like he was my father’s age. All mature and wise.

“You can protect me. You promise to bite people who hurt me. Or you can teach me to fight.” I frowned, my fingers looping in through the lace of the dress nervously.

“Dad won’t like it, princess. And you know I can’t go against his wishes. But you also know that you have nothing to fear. I will play with you after it's over, like always.”

My brother cheered me up and I nodded.

A knock sounded on the door and I rushed to greet our guests, all graceful and poised with mom standing behind me.

A woman and a boy who looked my age were at the door. The boy was sipping on a juice box as I greeted him politely, giving a little curtsy.

“Hello, my name is Valencia and I welcome you to the Blackwood pack.”

The boy didn’t bother replying, but only pulled out a slightly crumpled box from his pockets and thrust it in my hands.

“That is the costliest of all. And fancy.” He said proudly, handing me the strawberry banana juice.

I hated it. But I still drank it.

For the entirety of the half an hour that Alec was around, he looked bored, and utterly displeased, no matter how hard I tried to befriend him.

He left with his mother shortly after and I knew I had failed again.

That was my life for as long as I could remember.

What I didn’t remember was their names or faces after a while. They all were the same anyway- bratty, snobbish and cold.

I used to love getting dressed up in the fancy dresses mom bought for me, the cute toys and accessories, but as I grew up they lost their charm.

Everything did.

I was not sure what I did wrong, but all the boys kept leaving. Again and again and again. Mom kept striking the names of the boys off her list, and the look of concern always made me feel hopeless.

Only one boy was ever sweet and nice to me. My brother.

But even he couldn’t safeguard me from the slow, quiet heartbreak I went through with every such playdate.

The constant rejection was beginning to eat me slowly. Mom would hastily try to enroll me in some new music or cooking class, buy pretty dresses, but nothing worked.

Every week I went through the same ordeal.

“He’s got alpha potential, don’t say anything mean.”

I tried to protest but my parents kept saying, “You are getting older, princess. We just want you and our home to be safe.”

Because princesses were supposed to be polite and sweet.

Because girls were supposed to be delicate.

Because acting rash or smug was unladylike.

Being a princess was not all that lovely, as one might think. And if anybody ever told me again how lucky I was to have a caring family or a roof over my head, I was going to scream. Or elope.

Three days after my seventeenth birthday was the day that happened.

“Three alpha heirs? In a single day?” I asked, staring at my mother in shock as the maids were busy styling my hair and painting my nails.

“Yes dear, time is running out,” Mom said pensively.

I only stared at the list and back at her in shock.

“One of the guys is fifteen. Fifteen, mom!” I repeated, unsure if she could not see how absurd this was.

“Consider it as a formal meeting, dear. We are only trying to see if they would also want to meet you in the future. We are just trying to reserve a spot for you.” She said in an encouraging voice.

It was a ridiculous idea of some elder who thought kids who got along in childhood would be more likely to turn out to be mates after growing up. That's when all the playdates disguised as interviews began.

Of course, it largely favored the alpha heir, and the girls would clamor to be in their good books. However, I was growing tired of it.

I snorted, “Not the interview where they all judge me for wearing pink shoes or curling my hair?”

“A princess is not supposed to….” Mom began, and I filled in “...snort or laugh loudly. Or have a life in general. I get it.”

I said and then hated myself when I saw a hurt flash in her eyes. She was not at fault for this. I knew she was doing her best trying to find a guy who would be nice to me.

The world was fucked up and filled with power hungry alphas who killed for fun. And being their mate or perfect luna made my skin crawl.

And the urge only intensified when I found myself seated against the future alpha heir, the fifteen year old kid, acne concealed behind his fluffy hair.

I thought he was cute. Like a cat. Maybe I would just convince him to say yes and then go ahead and strike off my name from his list once he was of age.

“Look,” I began, but he cut me off and said, “You are a legend, you know?”

I blinked.

“I am?”

“My brothers told me all about you. And some of my friends. There’s a rumor going around that if you want to meet your mate on your 18th birthday, you have to reject Valencia.”

I stared at him blankly, letting that line sink in.

I didn’t react, didn’t say a word to anyone.

I might have failed my parents, but I still hadn’t failed myself.

So I left my home before that happened.

That night, I only packed my bags, left a note at my mom’s bedside table, and ran away from this miserable life to start over.

I was going to give myself another chance and write a new chapter of my life. All on my own.

# Chapter Two

(Five years later)

Valencia

The silence in my office was deafening. I could even hear the occasional owl hooting outside.

So, I turned on the laptop and put on some random video to serve as white noise.

It was 2.45 am after all. On a Friday night.

Of course, everybody was busy partying and having fun.

I, on the other hand, was content burying my head in the files and papers littered all over my desk.

My phone rang, and it brought a smile to my face to see Sophia’s name flash on the screen.

At least she cared about me.

“Are you really going to spend yet another Friday night buried in legal work?” She asked.

“I thought you were going on a blind date,” I argued and she chirped back, “Just wanted to see if you would cave in tonight.”

“I have to finish these files, Soph,” I said with a heavy sigh and she replied, “I know. But I think I found just the place you might want to shop around. No pressure.”

She sent me something right away. But I shook my head and ignored the buzzing of my phone.

I was that infamous first-year law associate who somehow managed to avoid crying or passing out under the pressure of working at the Agency of Non-Human Affairs.

Yeah, that place—the one handling all the chaos between non-human beings and humans. Our law department? Pretty solid, if I do say so myself.

Sure, werewolves and vampires get all the attention, but trust me, there are way more strange and mysterious types out there that humans have no clue about.

And as for werewolf-related issues with humans? Well, let's just say those problems are usually too messy or, frankly, beneath most of the higher-ups to bother with.

I couldn't care less.

Not that I could complain. People were more than happy to dump their files on my desk. After all, I was the dedicated, star associate who practically lived in the office, had aced the only job interview that mattered and earned decent.

Past me would definitely be proud of the future me. I had managed to build a life for myself in an unknown city, far away from home.

I owned a small apartment, knew what restaurant served what type of food in the entire city, and no pressure of wanting to please a future alpha heir.

My phone buzzed again.

\-Just check it-

I opened the earlier messages and found the name and address of a place.

Wolves & Whiskey

What was that? A hookah joint? A call for seance? What did she want me to buy?

Half an hour later, curiosity got the better of me and I found myself standing outside the huge neon sign.

The music was not loud and trashy. The place looked like anything but a bar or pub on the outside.

And truth be told, occasionally, I did feel like I needed some company. While reading through the files, I would accidentally come across something that would remind me of my family, of the laughs, of the carefree living, and I would feel a pang in the chest.

At least, I would have tried something new tonight.

The moment I entered the place, it felt like an alien world. People were not dancing in a frenzy and neither was the DJ blasting loud music.

Instead, there were tables arranged in neat rows, some enclosed in glass walls partially covered with curtains.

I ignored the swift glances and wondered if my friend had really sent me to a sketchy place where they sold illegal drugs.

But then I let my gaze wander. Women were seated mostly, and they were observing the men passing by, serving drinks, and minding their own business.

A woman rang a bell, and the man passing by her table stopped. She invited him to sit on the chair opposite her and they began chatting.

Weird.

What was going on?

Until I saw the girls' tuck several bucks into their shirts, and start to lick their apples. Boom, I finally knew what this place was for!

It was 'that place' —'The Pleasure house' but only for females’ pleasure

I spun on my heel, ready to run.

This wasn’t a place for good girls.

It wasn’t a place for me.

But I stopped.

No! I wasn’t that little princess anymore.

The one who sat around, waiting to be chosen.

So I spotted an empty table and sat by myself as well. I kept my hair pulled up in a bun and immediately put on a bright red shade of lipstick.

Bold. Sassy. Intimidating.

That was the look I was going for.

Sarah had sent me to shop, so I was going to be a picky buyer.

Holding my chin up and accepting the tall glass of drink one of the servers offered me, I sat back and let my gaze roam around the place.

And then my eyes fell on him. The man was tall, had a broad frame and a jawline that could rival blades. He was as intimidating as he was alluring.

A sea of beautiful faces was around me, but he stood out in the crowd. He was not even looking at me but standing beside a trembling woman while he stared down at a blonde guy.

Blondie had probably done something to annoy the woman. And the stranger said just one word.

“Leave”

Blondie didn’t do as asked, so the stranger plucked him off the chair and dragged him away like a rag doll.

I watched that altercation with mild interest.

Everybody returned to their business, but my eyes were locked on the door the stranger had walked through.

Was he the staff manager here? He did walk around with authority, but I noticed he was not wearing the staff uniform like the others.

I took a sip of the drink and then noticed him step out of the door, and our eyes met.

And he didn’t look away.

Not when he crossed the row of tables to order a drink, and neither when the bartender offered him one.

He cocked his head to the side just a little and raised the glass he was holding. I did the same, and we both took a sip of our drinks.

Suddenly, I couldn’t look at anything else.

The sounds around me muted. People around me faded into the background.

But he stood at the center of my attention. So effortlessly graceful.

We didn’t take our eyes off each other. Then I saw a hint of a smirk.

Was this going to be a staring match?

I had nowhere else to be.

So, we took one sip after another, slow and deliberate.

A few other women seemed to have noticed him suddenly because 2 of them walked up to him, instead of staying seated by their tables.

Those ladies were both beautiful and had already advanced ahead to strike a conversation with him.

However, he ignored them, ordered two drinks and began walking right towards me.

My breath hitched.

My gaze trailed to the other women, who seemed clearly offended by his move.

Lacing my fingers together, I muttered, “Not very gentlemanly of you to walk away from them.”

The stranger didn’t bother looking back at them as he offered the glass to me and replied, “You saw me first. They can’t skip the line.”

I got straight to the point before I would chicken out.

“Do you work here?”

He took a brief pause and then answered, “Kind of”

“What services do you offer?” I asked bluntly, and he was taken aback by the question.

“I serve the entire kingdom,” He answered and my gaze narrowed.

What did that even mean?

“Excuse me!” I blurted out, and he studied me as if I was not the one who was supposed to ask questions but him.

No, I was not going to let this turn into another one of those playdates.

“I apologize for not answering that correctly. Perhaps you could tell me what services you are looking for, exactly?”

He said, his voice deep and husky.

I wanted company. I wanted… not to return to my empty home.

But instead of saying that, I heard myself saying, “Sex”

# Chapter Three

Valencia

That had not been the first thing I planned to say to him.

A part of me mentally scolded myself for being so bold. Old habits die hard.

Mom would have fainted upon hearing such a crass word leave my mouth.

But I held his gaze.

And then he started to laugh!

A deep, rumbling sound that made my stomach do a weird flip.

I hated the way he laughed so easily, so carefree. It felt like a light caress against my skin.

Warm. Inviting.

Damn it.

“Why are you laughing? I mean, if you can serve all the women in the kingdom, surely you can serve me, right?” I raised an eyebrow.

The corner of his eyes crinkled with amusement as I drank up the sight in front of me.

His laughter gradually died down, and he shrugged. “Yeah, I did. And I'm experienced.”

I did not let him see the way my cheeks flushed by quickly looking at my glass to take a sip.

My heart was hammering loudly.

He did not just say that.

How many women had he been with? And why did it make me feel a slight pang of jealousy?

I barely finished taking a sip when he added in a whisper.

You want to try? I can do more than that.”

I wasn’t sure if my eyebrows could go any higher.

Was he teasing me?

“More? Like what? Changing light bulbs or doing my laundry?” I asked in a humorless voice, trying to imply that I was serious.

But it didn't have the effect I was hoping for.

He burst into laughter again, even coughing a bit. “Are you looking for a boyfriend or a maid?”

Something about that lazy confidence made me want to slap him and kiss him both.

He had not walked away yet, so he was interested in what I had to offer.

So, I placed my glass on the table, my forefinger lazily brushing over the rim.

“I’m looking for someone who wouldn’t mind being owned for a while.”

I was so done with the whole ‘mate,’ ‘dating,’ ‘claiming’ routine.

Honestly, I was tired of all that crap.

And why only alphas got to choose the perfect girl for themselves?

What if we flipped the table?

Why not just make it simpler?

I wanted a boy toy. Something like when I was a kid and wanted a Barbie doll—simple, easy, no fuss over all the mate drama.

My body language must have conveyed how serious I was because then his laughter stopped.

“You are serious about it, aren’t you?” He asked and looked at me like he was trying to figure out if I was bluffing. But I held his gaze and replied,

“Yes or no?”

“When you put it that way…”

I wasn’t wasting any time. I was already sitting on the edge of my seat, calculating how much cash was sitting in my salary account untouched.

He flashed me a grin, and, oh my Goddess, I swear my heart skipped a beat.

This was probably the most expensive doll I’d ever bought.

“I’ll take good care of you,” I added, “How does ten grand sound? But you’ll need to show me your health certificate, you know, just in case we’re gonna…”

He cut me off before I could finish, “Sure, I’m in.” He finished his drink without missing a beat.

He said it like it was a done deal. Like he’d just agreed to dinner instead of becoming mine.

He agreed?

Just like that?

I blinked and opened my mouth to say something.

But then someone came running towards my boy toy. And whispered something in his ear.

The change in him was instant.

Gone was the twinkle of amusement in his eyes or the relaxed posture. He went rigid, eyes sharp and alert.

His hands landed on the table with a thud, startling me.

He only gave the man a brief nod, and the man left immediately. My boy toy rose up from his seat.

No, we were not done. He had just agreed to be mine.

How could he just get up and leave?

My hand reached for his, but he had already taken a step forward.

I hated the way he was all amused and filled with laughter and the next second so detached and emotionless.

I hated that I was already feeling like he belonged to me.

Mine.

“Where are you going?” I asked, not liking the way I sounded flustered.

His gaze landed back on me. And softened.

Just a little.

“Give me your number,” He said flatly.

I nodded, grabbed a tissue, and hastily scribbled my number. He didn’t bother reading through it but pocketed it, nonetheless.

The ink had not even gotten time to dry. What if my writing got smudged?

How would I get in touch with him again?

I looked up at him, but he didn’t even bother sparing me a glance.

Only muttered, “See you later” and then disappeared into the crowd.

Gone. In an instant.

My shoulders slumped and I let my back hit the chair.

He didn’t linger. Didn’t ask me my name. Or give me his. I only watched him walk towards the exit and leave without a backward glance.

His abrupt exit stung.

I felt incredibly stupid for not even asking him his name. It looked like my wild night of fun had come to an end.

All the excitement of meeting him had just been a wild dream.

That's what I would tell myself when I woke up tomorrow and headed for office.

Grabbing my stuff, I hailed a taxi and then went back to my apartment. After changing into my pajamas, I got in the bed and kept staring at the ceiling, replaying my meeting with this enigmatic stranger again and again.

Would I ever see him again?

But before disappointment could completely engulf me, my phone buzzed.

There was a message from an unknown number.

I sat up so fast I nearly fell off the bed. Snatching it off the nightstand, I swiped to check the message.

Unknown Number: Consider this an apology for earlier today.

My heart jumped. I blinked.

Was it…?

Before I could process it, another message came in.

An image.

I gasped.

A very nearly naked picture of him filled my screen—damp hair, smirking lips, water beading on sharp abs that made me want to throw my phone across the room and fan myself at the same time.

His lower half was covered by nothing but a towel riding dangerously low. Too low. My mouth went dry.

I stared at the screen, heat crawling up my neck.

Those abs…I wanted to bite them already.

And stupidly, I typed that and sent it to him.

Goodness, what had I done?

I stared at the screen, wondering how he would react to seeing that message. I bit on my lower lip nervously and then, after a few excruciating moments of waiting, a message popped up on my screen.

Unknown Number: Be a good girl and you might have your wishes fulfilled soon.

# Chapter Four

Valencia

My heart stopped beating for a second.

Almost.

Then it wanted to jump out of my mouth and onto the floor.

I had never spoken to anyone like that. Never flirted like this.

I barely got any sleep last night.

And I was ashamed of how many times I had zoomed in on the picture to get a good look at those abs.

He was well built, no doubts about that, but damn, how could someone be so perfect? I had not really gotten to the point of imagining him shirtless because I had been too busy staring at his face.

But the surprise image left me feeling utterly stunned.

That body…that man…was he really mine?

Technically, I owned him, so why did my heart palpitate wildly upon seeing him call me a good girl?

I was melting already, and he had not even touched me yet.

There had been no further messages from him, but boy was I already looking forward to our next meeting.

My alarm went off at that exact moment, bringing me back to the present.

I had an office to go to, files to read.

Suddenly, the only thing filling me with excitement in the morning seemed dull.

‘Get a grip on yourself, Val’ I reminded myself sternly and got up from the bed.

After brushing my teeth and showering, I was in my office at 9.30 am.

And the moment I pushed the glass door aside to let the cool air of the AC blast upon me, I heard a voice.

“You are late”

I directed my attention to the owner of the voice. It was a woman, in her early thirties with bushy hair, and was wearing a pale pink dress.

A hideous pink colored brooch sat on her chest.

I glanced at the wall clock on the wall opposite me and replied,

“Only by thirty minutes”

The woman wasn’t impressed.

“Is that what you tell to your client who lost a case because you were late to file the case papers? Will that be your justification for a client being deported because you were too busy painting your nails?”

Was this woman mental?

“I am the new head of this office and I want everybody to respect time and work hard.”

“But, I have never been late in my life…” I began.

“Silence!!” She thundered and narrowed her eyes at me.

“You not only have to learn to respect time, but also your seniors. And I will be the one to teach you manners.”

She glowered and snapped at me when I tried to open my mouth again.

“Filing section. Now!! There are hundreds of files in disarray. Sort, tag and declutter it.”

What?

The filing section was in the basement, and it was overflowing with files. It would take me ages to get that done.

“But, we have started digitizing most of—”

“If you dare go against my orders one more time, you will be liable for disciplinary action. So tread carefully.”

The hell?

Who was this woman to show up out of nowhere and bully me? I was annoyed and frustrated, but when I saw other employees gathering, I only nodded and began walking towards the basement.

The woman grabbed me by the elbow and added, “You are going to address me as Ms Briggs or mam, understood?”

I tried not to punch her face and kept my calm before answering, “Sure, mam”

She was the fifth head of the office in the past two months. I wondered why they could not keep a person at the job even with such lucrative pay and perks.

I hoped she would be fired soon too.

Stomping my feet on my way down the stairs, I looked at the space gloomily.

I was the best goddamn associate in the bureau, and nobody had ever had a reason to point fingers at me.

I was late for the first time in my life after sitting for several nights in a row, helping my seniors get the papers sorted or researching to find some legal loophole.

And this is how I get rewarded for my hard work and dedication?

I placed my bag on the side, tied my hair in a bun, and rolled up my sleeves.

This was going to take forever.

I spent all of my work hours doing the highly boring and sleep inducing task of sorting out files. There were too many of them.

It would take me weeks to get everything done.

And there was nobody downstairs to even talk to. My back hurt from lifting the boxes and placing them in their assigned sections.

It was getting claustrophobic here, so I looked around to find the AC remote when I knocked off a box of files.

They were old, some had caught mold and their pages had yellowed.

I groaned at the thought of having to xerox them all and file them neatly again.

Cursing my fate, I flipped open the files and began to carefully print the xerox copies.

A paper fluttered down, and I bent down to grab it.

It was then that the writing caught my attention.

It was an old, classified paper. Its edges had crumpled, and the writing had grown very faint, too.

But there was a black and white grainy photo on it.

The blurred image was the side profile of a tall man. I couldn’t really make out anything else about him. There was also something scribbled in an ancient language I could not decipher completely.

But even through the smudged words, I read two words. Exiled Heir.

Heir to what? And why was he exiled?

Before I could read any further, I heard an angry hiss from behind me.

“How dare you look at classified files?” Ms Briggs shouted, her nostrils flaring.

My throat dried up. “It—it fell out of a box. I was just sorting—”

She walked over, snatched the file from my hands, and tucked it beneath her arm.

“This file doesn’t exist,” she said quietly. “If anyone asks, you didn’t see it.”

She turned and walked away like nothing had happened.

Leaving me there, stunned.

She had barely climbed back to the first floor when my phone buzzed.

There was a text message from my purchased doll.

I had still not saved his number. But I knew it was him.

Unknown number: Good morning, owner. What would you like me to do today?

Owner?

My cheeks flushed at that word, and I was glad he was not around to see it.

Me: Not disappearing in the middle of the conversation would be nice for starters.

I typed with a frown.

I saw the three dots appear on my screen. He was typing already.

Unknown number: I thought I apologized for that last night.

Yeah, by sending me a raunchy pic?

Me: If you think sending me an almost nude pic of yourself is all it takes to please me, you are wrong.

A pause.

My eyes were glued to the screen, and I thought he wouldn’t reply. But after several seconds, he shot me a reply.

Unknown number: I apologize for leaving without a word, my lady. Let me know how I should make up for the grave error.

I almost chuckled at the way he was talking to me. Like I was some princess, and he was my servant.

I had not paid him a dime yet, and I still didn’t know his name.

Me: I think I was too hasty in my decision. Now, you are on probation. And only if you perform well in your duties will you have truly passed the test.

I typed with a frown. And the reply was instant.

Unknown number: My lady is angry with me and she has every right to feel so. With your permission, I would like to allow a chance to perform my duties well.

No hesitation, no tantrums, no alpha shit.

He just accepted his fate readily.

I had expected him to just call quits and block me, but here he was still trying to appease me.

Me: That’s much better. I expect you at my doorstep when I’m home.

Giggling to myself, I saved his number as ‘The intern’ and received his reply shortly.

The Intern: I’ll be there, my lady.

# Chapter 5

Valencia

When I opened the door that evening, I wasn’t expecting to find him already inside.

But there he was.

Barefoot. Walking around like he knew the place.

And humming softly to himself as he folded the last of my laundry.

I blinked, stunned. “How—how did you even get in?”

He looked over his shoulder with a soft smirk, the golden light from my living room lamp casting a warm glow on his back. His voice was low and effortless. “You gave me a spare key, remember?”

I hadn’t.

Had I?

No. I would remember doing something so reckless. Or maybe he could pick locks.

But instead of asking, I stood frozen in the doorway, watching as he placed the folded clothes in my drawer like he belonged here. Like he’d done it a thousand times.

The scent of lemon and lavender floated around the room—my favorite cleaning spray.

“You cleaned?” I asked, dumbfounded.

“Scrubbed the bathroom tiles, organized your spice cabinet, deep-cleaned under your sofa—you’re welcome.”

My jaw dropped a little. “I didn’t ask you to do any of that.”

“I know.” He straightened and turned to face me, not even breaking a sweat. “But I believe in earning my keep. And my probation, as you so generously declared.”

Damn it. Why did he have to look that good while saying something that simple?

His hair was damp from a recent shower, and he’d changed into a simple white T-shirt that clung to his chest like a second skin.

I tore my gaze away and huffed, trying to mask the fluttering in my chest. “Well… thanks, I guess. I was planning to do all that this weekend.”

“Now you can rest.” He stepped closer, brushing a stray hair from my forehead like it was the most natural thing in the world. “You look tired.”

I swallowed. “I had a long day.”

“Want to talk about it?”

Yes.

No.

Yes.

But I didn’t want to sound weak, so I shrugged and tossed my bag onto the couch. “There’s this new woman at work. Total tyrant. Thinks she owns the place.”

His brow arched. “Bosses often do.”

“She sent me to the basement. Filing room duty. Like I was some incompetent child. I’m not—I’m actually one of the best associates they’ve got.”

“I don’t doubt that,” he said softly, eyes steady.

I knit my brows and looked at him.

“Are you stalking me or something?”

He lowered his head so that his breath fanned against my skin, making it tickle.

“Do stalkers do your laundry?”

I should have pushed him away. Asked him to get the hell out of my house.

But instead, I laughed.

And that made the tightly knit tension uncoil just a little in my stomach.

“Who are you, exactly?” I asked and he gave me a low bow.

“Your intern, my lady. And I am here to ensure that my internship doesn’t last long.”

I stared. “You do realize normal people text before showing up, right?”

He didn’t look up. “I don’t recall you asking for normal.”

I sighed, tossing my bag onto the couch and rubbing the back of my neck. “You’re lucky I’ve had a long day. And just so you know, there is nothing valuable in the home for you to steal. Plus, if you try acting smart, I can get you jailed in the blink of an eye.”

“Duly noted,” He said and observed the way I rubbed my neck.

“You look tired and stiff. Do you want me to help you relax?”

I wanted to say no, but something told me he was not here to harm me. That this might have started as a joke, but he seemed pretty serious about it.

I just didn’t know why.

But I could wonder about it later.

I barely gave a nod, and then he was already crouched down on his knees, pulling the coffee table in front of me

His thumbs pressed into the arch of my foot, and I forgot what words were.

My head lolled back, a sigh escaping before I could catch it.

He smiled without looking up. “There it is.”

“There what is?” I asked, using air quotes.

“The sound of your walls cracking.” He mused.

I scoffed, though it came out breathless. “You’re full of yourself.”

Instead, he lifted my other foot onto his thigh and ran his palms slowly along my calf. “Your muscles are tight. Do you stretch after work?”

I blinked at the sudden shift. “What?”

“Stretching. After hours, hunched over desks or locked in filing rooms?” He worked his thumbs in slow circles. “Or do you just collapse into bed?”

“That one,” I admitted, watching him closely.

“Thought so.”

“You really don’t have to—”

“My Lady.” His voice dropped, soft and commanding. “Let me take care of you.”

I did.

His hands settled on my shoulders, large and firm, working through the tension like he’d mapped every knot and pressure point in advance. I didn’t even realize how much stress I was holding until he started unraveling it.

“I could get used to this,” I muttered.

“You should.”

“Do you do this for all your clients?” I asked, mostly to cover the breathlessness.

“No.”

“Lucky me.”

He chuckled under his breath and rose, stepping behind me without warning. “May I?”

I nodded without even realizing what exactly I was saying yes to.

And then he plucked me off the floor like I weighed nothing and carried me to the bed to lay me on it, face down.

“A little massage would help with your stiff back.”

He murmured and then began kneading his fingers onto my skin, pressing on just the perfect pressure points that made my bones pop.

Ahh, it felt so damn good.

His presence and touch made me forget everything.

The office. The annoying new boss. And my loneliness.

When he finally pulled back, my hand shot out to grab his wrist, like it didn’t want to let go.

He turned around to look at me, eyes shining with mischief.

I gulped as we held our gazes. Then very slowly, he turned and bent a little, bringing his face closer to mine.

“Careful, my lady. Keep looking at me like that, and I’ll never leave.”

“Then don’t.”

I surprised myself with the words. His hand gently cupped my face, and his thumb traced my lower lip.

I felt my body shiver with pleasure.

His smile turned bittersweet. “Not tonight.”

“Why not?” I asked, feeling bold.

I didn’t want him to leave. I was beginning to like whatever this was already.

He didn’t answer me, so I grabbed him by his collar and pulled closer, inhaling his scent.

“I…” He began, but I didn’t want to hear anything. So instead, I closed the hair’s breadth of space between us and brushed my lips over his.

And I felt as if I had just been lit up by a live wire.

He didn’t move at first, probably shocked that I would do something like this so soon.

But then he brushed his lips against mine as well, soft and warm.

I could feel his hesitation to pull away. But I also knew he wanted to lean forward.

So, I coaxed him.

“Please”

And then his hands wrapped around my waist, and he obeyed. He kissed me within an inch of my life.

The complete opposite of slow and soft. Hungry and wild.

It was ravenous, it was consuming, and it was all too much at once. My mouth opened up to him easily, my fingers digging into his shoulder blades to pull him closer.

I don’t know why im so dependent on it because it’s not even that good without the sugar and i could easily just have tea instead, and idk if im impeding my treatment from working as it should. I’m going to cut it out eventually but i think im too addicted rn😓😓😓",5,1754895779.0,SIBO,9,1.0,False

I've been tampering with different filter baskets for my ROK EspressoGC for a while now, and I am not quite happy with ROK's 'standard' naked portafilter for this purpose. After looking around a bit, it appears there are some US and Asia-based options, but nothing to be found in Europe (meaning acceptable shipping fees).

Seeing as I am a Europe-based mechanical engineer, I would be more than able to design and produce this, but doing it just for myself is, although fun, not financially interesting.

The idea is to design a naked portafilter that lies flat and stable on any surface you place it on, making the tamping process more comfortable. In addition, I would like for it to be usable for various sizes (49-51mm width, 20-40mm depth) of portafilter, for ease of experimentation.

When I turned 18 I started finding myself in new…and creative…ways, that would have caused my folks’ big religious hearts stop if they found out. Mildly put, I sought men’s attention, approval, and guidance online. I absolutely loved the sense of empowerment I got by sharing myself, my adventures, and development with others. It felt like real growth in all the areas that had been stunted for far too long due to my upbringing. 

Then one day, it all got a lot more complicated. A local farmer who often frequented the coffee shop I worked at as a barista, also happened to be an online follower, and after many daily interactions somehow put it together - that his favorite barista was also his favorite faceless creator. 

At first it seemed to be a blessing in disguise. He started off kind, promised to keep my secret safe and cheered me on in my online endeavors; a true relief! 

However, the utopia came to an end when his wife left him. My supportive and only online-offline friend went from being content just chatting at the coffee shop to being jealous of everything I was doing online and offline. He wanted me to stop my online presence fully, and be his girl. Only his. 

When I kindly refused, he reminded me the power he held over me with easy access to my parents. Openly implying he’d walk up to our door and dox me to my family. The few people in my life who matter most!

Every fear and anxiety I ever had was coming true. 

I appeased him in the beginning by not posting much online, and begging him to be patient with me; while also keeping him at bay by often leaving town for absolutely ‘necessary’ reasons. 

Deep-down I figured he’d not risk losing all leverage by going ahead telling my family what I was up to online, unless he truly thought he no longer had a chance with me. 

It was a tiring game that once again, much like my upbringing, was a restrictive and suffocating grasp holding me back from what I truly wanted!

Eventually, I realized the only escape is through and made the hard decision to come clean.

Initially I planned on only doing so with my mom and sister who I still live with. I knew that while it will not be an overly proud moment for them, they would eventually understand and maybe even support me. But then circumstances (…local farmer…) drove me to have to open up to my father as well recently. 

Unlike my mom and sister who are both women and rather disenfranchised with the Christian church since my folks’ divorce; having that discussion with my father was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done (for so many reasons). 

Finally…the biggest weight is off my chest, I am left unbound and free. Ready to see what can be, unburdened by what has been",5,1754895644.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I’m in Thailand right now trying to learn the language. My old design let me learn lots of random stuff, but not the things I actually needed. I did pick up numbers and a few other basics, but it wasn’t enough.

So I scrapped it and started fresh. I’ve now built it with OpenAI + a custom Thai dictionary (which I actually discovered through this sub u/Faillery if you want free subscription please comment here).

How it works:  
Snap a photo of anything or just ask a question.  
The app gives you the answer along with relevant vocabulary.  
You can bookmark anything to review later.

I’m planning to add a study screen with flashcards or quizzes. If you’ve got ideas for what else would help, I’m all ears.

I'm also designing an admin page where I would ask my Thai friends to record real native pronunciation for the most used words and phrases. 

I’m not trying to make a profit – I just want more people to discover Thai language and to cover AI and hosting costs. Depending on usage, I’ll adjust the subscription, but right now it’s about the price of a coffee.

Hope this post finds you well. I’m a dude from Roxas City, and if you’re reading this, you’re either an avid redditor or I finally figured out how to post this correctly.

A little about me:
 - I'm a night owl working the graveyard shift from home, so my ideal date night might involve a late-night coffee, a sunset, or maybe just watching the sunrise.🌄

 - I spend my free time lifting heavy things at the gym and trying not to drop them on myself. I've got a decent face to go with the decent form.💪🏻

 - My main homebody hobbies are reading books (currently a huge fan of classic sci-fi and fantasy), and maintaining my two aquascape fish tanks. It’s like a tiny underwater world and I’m the benevolent overlord.🤣

 - I love to cook, and I’m pretty good at it. I’ve mastered the art of making delicious food for one, but I'm looking for a reason to cook for two.🧁

 - I have three dogs that are my world. They’re a full-time job, but they're cute enough to get away with it.🐶🐶🐶
 
- My skin is my canvas, and my tattoos are a testament to my inner geek. We're talking Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Back to the Future, and the original Mummy franchise (Brendan Fraser is a national treasure).🍿

 - My music taste is a bit all over the place. One moment I'm jamming to Royal Blood and twenty one pilots, the next I’m chilling with J. Cole and Luke Combs, then suddenly it's Bad Bunny and Frank Sinatra.🤖👽👾🎃

What I’m looking for:
 - Someone with a good sense of humor who doesn’t take life too seriously.
 - Bonus points if you're a gamer girl open to some coop action. I'm a good teammate, I promise!
 - A gym girly would be cool, but not required!
 - It would be great if you're somewhere in or near Roxas City, Capiz. Proximity helps for those spontaneous coffee dates.
 - If you also appreciate good books, a great movie marathon, and can handle a night owl's schedule, you've pretty much won my heart.

So, if you’re a funny, cool girl who’s into some of the same stuff, hit me up! Let's grab a coffee and see if we can get a high score together.💖❤️💘",1,1754894852.0,singleph,0,1.0,False

The coffee at his hand had long gone cold. On the Bloomberg terminal, the dark pool data flowed like a black river, one hundred million shares, changing hands in both directions.

“They’re still pressing,” he murmured.

He knew well that most of those numbers were not born of natural selling. In the dark they pinned the price low, as one might pin the tail of a great beast,

He opened a folder, it was about the actual progress on the company’s ATM program. The figure inside was small, absurdly so. Even he had felt a moment’s disbelief the first time he saw it.

“They think we’ve flooded the market already,” he said, the corner of his mouth curling. “We haven’t.”

That was his card, and there was no reason to lay it down yet. Time would do the work. The FTDs would roll and swell like a snowball on a long slope, until they grew too large for the enemy to carry. Then they would panic on their own.

A notification flashed on his screen. Someone on the social feeds was rallying the call to short. Joel clicked it open, glanced for a moment, then shut it away.

He remembered, a few days past, the quiet moment when he had pressed a single “like” beneath a YOLO post,just hours before the Phase 2 results were made public. Not a whim, but a signal. The prey was already in the trap.

The city before dawn still lay deep in sleep, but Joel had played the ending through his mind a hundred times. He wanted no sudden, wasteful burst. He wanted the shorts to believe they were landing safely, only to find the earth gone beneath their feet.

When that moment came, the price would spring upward like a steel bowstring loosed from the draw. And this time the shorts would have no warrant to raise as their shield .

6 Weeks in the Gas Plan Circus

By DJ Dikro 


---

Chapter 1 — The Bait and Switch

I didn’t set out to be a traveling salesman. Hell, if you’d asked me the day before, I’d have told you I was going to work in a cozy office answering calls for irritated customers. A nice, warm building. Four walls. A desk. The dream.

Instead, I walked into what I thought was a customer service job interview, aced a “test” I didn’t even understand, and was told — with great fanfare — that I was now certified as an energy reseller.

It wasn’t until the next day, standing on some random street corner in the wind, that I realized what that actually meant:
I was now a commission-only door-to-door gas plan salesman.

No base pay. No safety net. Just a clipboard, some brochures, and the faint hope that someone might open their door and willingly sign a contract for a service they didn’t know they wanted.

The veterans knew the game. If you wanted to make real money, you lied. Invent “limited-time offers,” promise nonexistent savings, and — in some cases — just forge the damn signature if the customer was too old or too polite to stop you.

I wasn’t going to do that. I’d only sign up people who actually wanted the service. Which, of course, meant I was at the bottom of the sales board most days.

To make it worse, I started noticing a pattern: the contracts I did bring in? Sometimes they’d disappear, only to reappear under my supervisor’s name. At first, I thought it was a mistake. Then I realized — nope. He was taking my work and cashing in.

It was my first real education in how cutthroat sales can be. And this was just week one.

Chapter 2 — Dry County in the Middle of Nowhere

One afternoon, we got dropped in a small rural town that barely looked big enough for a post office. It was December, and by 3 p.m., the light was already turning gold — the kind of gold that means “soon you’ll be knocking on doors in total darkness, and people will think you’ve lost your mind.”

We were cold, tired, and desperately in need of somewhere to thaw out before we had to go back to our “crazy strangers knocking after sundown” shift. All twelve or thirteen of us drifted into the one warm place in town: a small Chinese restaurant.

It smelled like soy sauce and hot oil — heaven after hours in the wind. We filled almost every table, shedding layers of jackets and scarves like molting birds. The waiter, a middle-aged man with the calm efficiency of someone who’s seen it all, came to take orders.

My buddy, eyes half-closed in bliss just to be indoors, said:

> “Yeah, I’ll start with a beer.”



The waiter paused. Looked him dead in the eye.

> “Excuse me, sir… this is a dry county.”



Silence.

We all glanced at each other, trying to process the phrase. Dry county? Like… there’s no liquor store? No bar?

Nope. Turns out “dry county” means no alcohol at all. Not in restaurants, not in stores — nowhere. It was like finding out you’d stumbled into a parallel universe where beer was contraband.

Our dream of a warm buzz to end the day evaporated instantly. The only thing we were getting tipsy on that night was Pepsi and hot-and-sour soup. Somewhere outside, Alberta was probably laughing at us.


---

Chapter 3 — The Day I Accidentally Outsold My Supervisor

Most days, I was the honest guy at the bottom of the scoreboard. But one random day, the universe decided to give me a gift.

From the first knock, people were in good moods. Doors opened, conversations flowed, and by lunchtime I’d already signed more contracts than I usually got in an entire week.

Around mid-afternoon, I spotted my supervisor pacing the street, looking irritated. Normally, he was Mister Swagger — clipboard in hand, smirk plastered on his face. But today? He looked like someone had stolen his lunch.

When we met at pickup, I laid my stack of contracts on my lap. The van went quiet.

> “Wait… you got how many?” he asked, his voice sharp.



I told him. His jaw twitched. I could feel the salt radiating off him.

This was the same guy who’d been skimming my contracts on other days. And here I was — without lying, without even trying — absolutely stomping him.

It lasted one glorious day. The next morning, I was back to my usual two contracts. But that brief moment of glory? Worth every frozen toe.

Pickup was never simple. The idea was: drop everyone off, regroup at the same spot four hours later, and head home. In practice? A mess.

Nobody could stand around outside in the cold for that long, so people scattered into cafés, corner stores, and sometimes stranger’s living rooms if the residents were friendly enough.

This was the early smartphone era — Google Maps was still learning how to walk, and if you didn’t have a phone, you were navigating blind.

Halfway through the trip, I caved and signed myself up for a new cell plan. That’s how I ended up with the legendary BlackBerry Storm — one of the first touchscreens. It lagged, ate battery like a monster, and sometimes the screen looked like it had snowflakes stuck on it. But it had maps. And that meant I never got lost again.

Other people weren’t so lucky. Every few days, we’d have a “missing person” incident. Supervisors would go into panic mode, drive around in circles, call dead flip phones, and eventually find the missing rep at some gas station, clutching a lukewarm coffee like it was their life source.

I never said it out loud, but yeah… I secretly giggled every time.

Chapter 5 — The Strangers in Picture Butte

Picture Butte was something else entirely.

The town was small enough that we were instantly noticed. People didn’t slam doors here — they smiled, waved us in, and poured coffee while asking where we were from.

Sometimes, they’d stop mid-conversation, look past me at my partner, then scan the street before asking with genuine curiosity:

> “…and you guys come from where?”



By mid-afternoon, the whole town was buzzing about “the strangers in town.” And instead of hostility, there was warmth. Curiosity. That good small-town energy.

We’d split up for our routes, then cross paths at the café to charge our phones and swap stories. The air was cold enough to sting, but the laughter made it feel lighter.

That day, we weren’t just salespeople — we were guests in a living, breathing snow globe.

Chapter 6 — The Big Picture

Six weeks, two provinces, one shady job.

I made about $1,600 before taxes. If someone had offered me that for the hours I worked, I’d have been insulted. But the pay wasn’t the point anymore.

I got an education in human nature — generosity, greed, kindness, dishonesty, and everything in between. I saw Alberta in winter, Ontario’s small towns, and learned the survival skill of finding warmth in the middle of nowhere.

It was weird. It was exhausting. It was shady.

And yeah — it was basically like joining a circus.

1mn5tow,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1mn5tow/living_with_unaccepting_parents/,Living with unaccepting Parents,"Hi, It's been a few months since i've been officially diagnosed? with bpd/eupd- so bare with me as i'm still coming to terms and understanding everything if that makes sense. i have been trying for six years to get a diagnosis from being told im just depressed to saying im bipolar ive finally had the correct assessments and have my answer!! Yay. But on to the matter at hand. I'm a Univeristy student (college i guess in the usa) and from september to june i live away from home (i think it's important to add im only 40 mins away from my parents in student housing yet they've never come to visit me in three years of me being there) So rightfully, over the summer i have to move home as i can't afford to stay there as it's £2000 and i don't have that.

 I find having a job hard, i love working especially in pubs/ bars but after a while something happens and i switch to a person i don't know and i can't even get out of bed. So moving home- i was open with my mother about my new diagnosis and explained everything to her in a way she would understand. My father on the other hand cannot know. He is basically against mental health. As stupid as it sounds. My father clearly has ptsd from time in service, aswell as other things but looks down on treatment and medication as it makes a person ""weak"" and ""what good is a pill gonna do"" 

Since moving home, my best friend of six years has dropped me, he claimed i've said horrible things about him to people. I'm the most loyal girl out there, someone close to me would never be spoken bad of in any situation. if i love you, you know i'm never gonna mess up that friendship. So rightfully after that situation happened (i won't go into it but it's obvious someone who doesn't like me, has been making things up) i was upset. Abandonment very promiment in my head. He didn't even ask for my side and it hurt. I've been talking to friends and getting out of it but it hurts. 

My parents offered no affection or love. Now onto the main issue. My parents don't really want me about. I'm too easy to upset. I'm too emotional. On weekends i usually drive an hour to see my boyfriend however with no money and other things it's hard- which is an inconvenience to them as they want to do their own things (i'd like to point out i'm 22 and im only home because i have no money and no where to crash until september. so i stay out their way) If i talk to my parents about anything they will state after about 60 seconds ""bored now"" or ""go see your friends your talking too much"" so in turn i go into my room, as my friends live hours away. i'm then anti social and never spend time with them and sending myself to an early grave for lack of fresh air and exercise. So then i go out- which they need to know when, where, how long the contradictions continue. 

every morning my parents have coffee and sit in bed. I will walk in to say good morning and sometimes sit with them to ask about their plans for the day. Today, my father asked me why i was there, i said it was to say hi and just see what today plan was for them. He turned and looked at me and said ""hi, bye you can go now"" instantly it hurt. Like a level i'm used to but it hurt. i got up said i needed to go to the bathroom anyway and left. To which that was recieved as me being a bitch and i got shouted at. 

I'm at a loss here. I cannot talk to my parents, spend time with them without being a ""leech"" or annoying. My friends live far away and are busy anyway, my boyfriend has a life of his own and i'm only allowed at his two nights a week (he lives with his parents also and his sister kicks off if i'm there more that two nights as it's unfair her boyfriend can't stay that long) Nothing i do is good enough and i just want to know if trying so much will work or if i need to find something to hide from it all. 

Sorry for the many segways- and lack of everything i'm not good about explaining things. ",1,1754894552.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

1mn5qio,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1mn5qio/does_my_coworkerfriend_like_me_or_is_he_just/,does my coworker/friend like me or is he just being friendly?,"I've been working with this guy for the past two years. I wasn't attracted to him and I didn't think he was attracted to me whatsoever, but we have a lot in common and get along well. We travel very frequently for work, so when we're on the road we usually grab dinner/lunch/coffee/beers together and go on hikes. I wouldn't say that's uncommon or out of the ordinary for my office -- various combinations of people will go to workout classes, dinners, sightseeing, etc. If my job didn't involve the travel it involves, I probably wouldn't be confused. The one on one socialization is kind of built in. 

I found out recently that we have very similar taste in music, political views, and hobbies. He asked recently (maybe a month ago) if I had heard of a band and if I wanted to go to a concert with him and his best friends from high school. The same day, I went over to his apartment to play board games with him and another one of our coworkers (who happens to be interested in me, but that is neither here nor there). We're all single and ended up kind of bitching about how dating sucked and how we don't want to single. I've said several times that I don't think you should eat where you shit, but at the same time, our travel schedule makes it difficult to actively date around. Didn't think much of it. After I went home, he said something to the effect of ""thanks for coming over :) hope you had a great time"" and asked if I had purchased the concert ticket. I did. 

This past Friday night, he texted asking if I was in town. I had been in a different state for work for about a month and had JUST landed at the airport. He said he and his roommates were going to be going out in my neighborhood and asked if I wanted to come. I said sure, and I brought my friend with me. I probably shouldn't have brought her but I also wasn't going to go meet a group of men for the first time without reinforcements. Had a great time and drank a lot. Roommates were nice and asked me quite a bit about myself. They also asked me why I didn't live closer to them? / That I should move to their neighborhood.  Will see them again at a house party in a few weeks.

None of this individually would have made me question anything. But I also have a history of being oblivious. Every guy friend I've ever had has ended up ""liking"" me. TBH I don't think I'm anything to write home about and am actually rather off-putting. I wouldn't be surprised if this guy didn't even think of me as a girl (??) It dawned on me that within the next month, I will have met his college roommate, current roommates, and high school best friends. I don't introduce coworkers to my close friends left and right, but maybe that's just me. I am also probably overthinking this way too much. ",2,1754894208.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1mn5qdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1mn5qdi/accidentally_discovered_that_doing_my_hardest/,Accidentally discovered that doing my hardest task first makes my ADHD brain cooperative for the rest of the day,"Context: I have ADHD and struggle with executive function. Most productivity advice doesn't work for me because neurotypical brains and ADHD brains operate differently.

Last week I overslept and had to rush to work. Usually I start my day with easy tasks (checking email, organizing files) to ""warm up"" my brain. But because I was late, I had to immediately jump into the hardest thing on my list, writing a complex report I'd been avoiding for weeks.

Something weird happened: I knocked out that report in 90 minutes. Then I rode that momentum through the rest of my tasks like I was on fire. I got more done in one day than I usually do in three.

I thought it was a fluke, but I've been experimenting with ""hard task first"" for two weeks now, and it's consistently working. Turns out my ADHD brain LOVES the dopamine hit from completing something difficult early in the day.

The traditional advice is to work up to hard tasks gradually, but that just gives my brain time to overthink and procrastinate. Starting with the hardest thing tricks my brain into hyperfocus mode before it realizes what's happening.

It only works if I do it IMMEDIATELY after coffee, before my brain has time to negotiate with itself. No checking phone, no email, no ""just five minutes"" of easy stuff. Straight from coffee to the hardest task.

This goes against every productivity method I've tried, but it's the first thing that consistently works with my ADHD instead of against it.",27,1754894194.0,Productivitycafe,8,1.0,False
1mn5ozs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScammersPH/comments/1mn5ozs/malasjuicy_scam_ish/,Malasjuicy - Scam (ish),"Sobrang disappointed ako sa sarili ko na nagpaloko ako ng ganitong level. All of the signs were there but I was too stupid to notice. Ibang ulo ang nagiisip. May this serve as a reminder to all men of AJ. 

Nagstart ang lahat with a post for a ons. Unexpected, mga four (4) ang nagmessage. Met with one, fantastic meet, pero feel ko di ko siya nasatisfy. Tried to message the other three, then sa dalawa dun, g magmeet up. Okay sige parang aligned ang stars for me. I met the scammer near her place in Mandaluyong. Nauna ko siyang i meet kasi yung isa next week pa available sched. 

Nung una, medyo kinakabahan pako kasi baka magflake sa akin. The signs were there:
1. Delayed responses
2. Namimili lang ng rereplyan out of the many questions that I sent (do you want to grab coffee before CI? Do you have a curfew in mind? Etc) 
3. Nagpapasend pa ulit ng picture before the meet

Pero alas, nagpakita siya. After waiting 30 minutes for her, nakapagkita din. Unang una kahit ons, sobrang bastos na nagpapahintay ka ng ganun katagal without valid reason. Ni hindi man lang siya nagsosorry that it took her that long. Speaks volume kung anong klaseng tao siya (yes, even if you have the face to make up for it) 

After getting in sa car, vibe check daw muna as usual, so i agreed and nagdrive kami papunta sa nirerequest nyang place. Nag-go ako kasi kinakabahan ako. Napaka-simp ko talaga. Pinalagay ko lang sa Waze kahit medyo malayo, kasi nga i live to satisfy hahaha kingina

To cut the story short, meron pa siyang hinahanap na specific na food. Tangina sige g hanap tayo. Hirap lang, yung oras na yun, wala na masyadong bukas na establishment para sa hinahanap niya. Such a fucking hassle. Then, nagpropose siya if dun nalang sa place nya and wag na magCI. Naiisip ko to make up for the gas money and money na ginamit to buy her food, win win na rin. Di ko na need magbayad ng CI. 

Ikot kami from her requested place and balik sa condo nya. While nandun, accomodating naman siya and all. Pasok ko lang din pala na habang nasa byahe kami, she's so occupied with her phone, kesyo magbobook ng flight ng nga kasamahan nya. Red flag na agad kasi grabe bakit ka pa makikipagmeet kung may gagawin ka pala? Wala rin naman siyang sinabi prior to the meet na may ganito. All the while casually na nya dinadrop na may problem ang payment pero wala naman siyang prinopropose or anything. 

Going back, pagdating sa condo. Smoke lang kami habang nagtatry siyang magbook, and dahil nagtrtry nga siya magbook, ako lang mostly nagsmosmoke. May mga tinatawagan siyang tao and all kaya di ko naman pinagisipan ng masama. After non, nung medyo sabog nako, dun na siya humirit if we can use my card for the payment amounting to 6k. Hesitant pa ako nung una kasi ayaw ko nga ibigay actual details ko and my name. Basta sa kabulagan at kabobohan naggive in ako sa notion nya na discreet naman and wala naman siyang pake sa identity ko. Okay sige book. In exchange babayaran nya nalang din daw agad. Tatransfer nya lang din daw that night and medyo rush lang kasi nagbabago daw ang price every 10 minutes or so. 

Upon payment, nagtanong pako sakanya, hindi naman to scam no? Hahaha naaalala ko ginamit nya pang argument yung condo na kung scam nga ito, bakit pa kita papapasukin at papaakyatin sa condo ko? Edi naniwala naman si tanga. Transfer nalang daw nya later.

Okay sige, punta tayo sa gagawin na yung deed. Puyat daw siya kasi galing daw siya sa isang foreign trip, studies, + ibang excuse pa. O edi sige, tuwing magmamake ako ng move, lagi siyang nagsasabi ng 5 mins 5 mins kasi magnap daw muna siya. Bilang naniniwala sa wild concept ng consent, syempre tigil tayo. Parang cinacaress ko lang siya habang nagnanap. Napatanong nga ako to a point na cnc ba trip mo kaya youre saying na your going to take a nap para gawin ko nalang gusto ko sayo??? Sabi niya hindi daw gusto niya genuine na magnap daw edi sige pota

Umabot sa point na nagsawa talaga ako and naghintay makatulog siya. Naglaro ako ng block last for 20 minutes to let her sleep. Nagmake ulit ng move after, same script. Umay lods. Sabi ko caress ko nalang. Medyo lumikot kamay ko and na-rub ko pussy nya, sobrang basa na. I took that as a message na kahit sinasabi niyang ayaw nya pa, g na katawan nya. I said sorry and that i need to eat her out na kasi kanina pako nagpipigil. Hindi niya naman ako pinigilan and i ate her out. Hindi siya nagcum and nagpahinga nalang kami ulit. Same script. Nap muna siya and ituloy nalang nin after. 

After the 15th rejection (yes binilang ko), napaisip kong magcheck ng bank account to see if nagreflect yung sinabi niyang trinansfer. Wala pa rin. So tinanong ko siya if real time ba talaga yung transfer nya. Si ate mo girl nawala antok, yes daw instant daw yun. She even called the customer support of wise para mapakita na determined talaga siya to send ng payment. Pero pagtingin ko sa transactions nya, lahat ""waiting for your money"" at ang dating sa akin non ay nagsend siya ng amount na wala naman talaga sa bank account niya, right?? Hindi naman ako baliw ganun magwork yang neo bank na yan? 

Anyway basta daming excuses. Nagiba na tone ng pakikipagusap ko sakanya kasi after all the hassle, the rejections, parang ako pa mawawalan ng 6k??? Dumating pa yung point na natatakot na daw siya sa akin. I even told her na sa akin ka pa ba matatakot? Naaccomodate ko yung umikot tayo kung saan kahit wala yun sa usapan before the meet, respects her boundaries tuwing sasabihin niya na ayaw pa nya (5 minutes nya, 50 minutes irl), and iniintindi ko to my core lahat ng explanations nya kahit wala nang sense. 

Ako pa yung nagaslight na hindi ako nagtitiwala sakanya. In the end, ako pa nagsorry for doubting her. Left her condo saying sorry and will wait nalang for the actual payment. 

Ito na yung red flag confirmations na natanggap ko kaya di nako umaasang babalik pa yung 6k sakin
1. No urgency. Nagask ako ng update kasi nga 6k is a large amount of money for me. Ang update lang is wait lang ill check, then no reply for another day. Nagreply lang ulit nung nagchat ako. 
2. Name provided is so sus, kahit anong deep search ko, wala talaga.
3. Another perfect excuse: nagpakita ng sc na yung google account nya daw ay nahack, pero ang screenshot lang ay mababa ang security rating ng google account nya. 
4. Gave her this lunch to settle the amount expected, no reply until now. 

Yes, you're busy. Pero nakisuyo ka eh? And you know na praning nako di mo pako ineentertain. Kahit naman maghintay ako eh basta alam ko lang bakit ako naghihintay and hindi mo ako stinastall. Hay. I need help. Can you suggest ways on how to tell if yung pinagsasabi niya ay modus? She was using a wise account which i am not familiar with. Saying na dahil yun sa VA work nya. 

Will retract this post if ever i get a message from her na magbabayad talaga or mageexplain bakit sobrang coincidence ng lahat. Thanks if ever you finished this post",5,1754894045.0,ScammersPH,8,0.73,False

Ayoko rin magmadali sa pagbili, so I’m taking my time to make sure sakto sa needs ko at pasok sa budget.

Here’s what I’m looking for:
	• Lightweight at portable – madaling dalhin kahit saan (coffee shop, travel, o kahit paikot sa bahay)
	• Good display quality – malinaw at vibrant para sa panonood ng movies, Netflix, at YouTube habang WFH (mas nakaka-focus ako pag may naka-play sa gilid 😂)
	• Drawing capability – dapat compatible sa stylus for light sketches and doodles
	• Smooth performance – walang lag for basic multitasking, browsing, and casual use
	• Decent battery life – tumatagal ng ilang oras na tuloy-tuloy na gamit
	• Budget-friendly – reasonable price pero hindi sobrang compromised ang quality

So far, ito yung nasa list ko:
	• iPad 9th Gen – reliable iOS experience, supports Apple Pencil (1st gen)
	• Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite – may kasamang S Pen, magandang screen, sulit sa price
	• Xiaomi Pad 6 – mataas ang specs for the price, may high refresh rate display

1mn5ksn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CalorieEstimates/comments/1mn5ksn/how_i_reduced_my_weight_in_just_3_months/,How I Reduced My Weight in Just 3 Months,"**📅 Duration:** 12 Weeks  
**🏁 Starting Weight:** 82 kg (180 lbs)  
**🎯 Goal Weight:** 72 kg (159 lbs)  
**✅ Final Weight:** 71.5 kg (157 lbs)  
**📏 Total Loss:** 10.5 kg (23 lbs)

# Background

For years, I struggled with inconsistent eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle. My daily routine involved long hours at the desk, minimal physical activity, and frequent takeout meals. I wasn’t obese, but I felt tired, sluggish, and uncomfortable in my own body.

In April this year, I decided to commit to a structured 3-month plan — not a crash diet, but a sustainable approach combining **nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle changes**.

# Approach

# 1. Calorie & Nutrition Strategy

* **Calorie Deficit:** I calculated my maintenance calories (\~2,200/day) and reduced intake to **1,700–1,800 calories/day**.
* **Macronutrient Focus:**
   * Protein: 110–130g/day
   * Carbs: 150–180g/day
   * Fats: 50–60g/day
* **Food Choices:**
   * Breakfast: 3 boiled eggs + oatmeal with berries
   * Lunch: Grilled chicken breast, quinoa, steamed veggies
   * Snack: Greek yogurt or a handful of almonds
   * Dinner: Fish or paneer with salad
   * Drinks: Mostly water, green tea, and black coffee

# 2. Exercise Routine

* **Strength Training:** 4 days/week (full-body split) focusing on compound lifts: squats, deadlifts, bench press, and rows.
* **Cardio:** 2–3 days/week of brisk walking or cycling for 30–45 minutes.
* **NEAT (Daily Movement):** Increased steps to **8,000–10,000/day** by walking after meals and taking the stairs.

# 3. Lifestyle Adjustments

* **Sleep:** Maintained 7–8 hours/night.
* **Meal Prep:** Cooked most meals at home to control ingredients.
* **Mindful Eating:** Ate slowly and stopped at 80% fullness.
* **Tracking:** Used MyFitnessPal to log food and workouts daily.

# Challenges Faced

* **Social Events:** Learned to enjoy meals out without overeating — choosing grilled options and avoiding sugary drinks.
* **Plateaus:** Around week 7, progress slowed. I adjusted by increasing protein and adding 15 minutes to cardio sessions.
* **Cravings:** Managed by keeping high-protein snacks and drinking more water.

# Results

* **Weight:** Down 10.5 kg (23 lbs) in 12 weeks.
* **Body Fat:** Estimated drop from 28% → 20%.
* **Strength:** Increased squat from 60 kg to 85 kg.
* **Energy:** No more afternoon crashes, improved focus at work.

# Key Takeaways

1. **Moderation works better than extreme diets** — I didn’t cut out carbs or favorite foods, just controlled portions.
2. **Strength training preserves muscle** while losing fat.
3. **Tracking helps stay accountable**, but I didn’t obsess over perfection.
4. **Lifestyle changes beat quick fixes** — I built habits I can maintain beyond the 3 months.

# Before & After

* **Before:** Tired, inconsistent, poor diet, low activity.
* **After:** Energized, stronger, leaner, and more confident.

**Final Advice:** If you’re starting your weight loss journey, focus on small, consistent changes. You don’t need to starve yourself — just eat in a slight deficit, move more, and lift weights. Progress comes faster than you think when you’re consistent.",1,1754893590.0,CalorieEstimates,0,1.0,False

Since AI tools started becoming part of my workflow, I’ve been experimenting with what I call **“vibe coding”** — focusing on the idea and experience while letting AI handle repetitive parts. My latest side project from this approach is **Invoice Generator – Invoica**, an iOS app to make invoicing *fast, simple, and professional*.

[Invoice Maker \(Generator\) -  Inovica](https://preview.redd.it/j71kj27c3cif1.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea5ae18e34e1888670011edb9978888de0899a1f)

I built it for freelancers, small business owners, and service providers who don’t want to deal with bulky invoicing software. You can:

* **Create professional invoices in seconds** – just add client details, line items, tax, and discounts.
* **Customize templates** – add your logo, brand colors, and contact info.
* **Export as PDF & share instantly** – via email, WhatsApp, or any platform.
* **Work with multiple currencies & tax types** – GST, VAT, custom tax rates supported.
* **Manage clients** – save details for faster invoicing next time.
* **Track payments** – mark invoices as paid or unpaid to monitor your earnings.
* **Secure your data** – lock the app with passcode or Face/Touch ID.
* **Add payment links** – get paid faster through direct client payments.

I wanted something you could open, fill out, and send *before your coffee even cools down*. That’s why the UI is minimal, the steps are quick, and everything is mobile-first.

Would love to hear from the community:

* Any must-have invoicing features you think I should add?
* Do you also use AI in your development process, and how?

1mn5i8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1mn5i8d/letter_to_the_one_i_love/,Letter to the one I love,"Dearest one,

I’ve been thinking about you, about us, and I wanted to reach out, not with any expectations, but simply to share some thoughts that have been taking shape in my heart.

I see now that some of our most beautiful moments together were when we could simply exist peacefully alongside one another. I realize I may not have always honored how precious that tranquility was, or understood what you needed to feel truly comfortable and yourself.

If I had to summarize one of the biggest differences between us, I think it might come down to what we were each taught to expect from love. For me, I’ve come to see love as something we do, not just something we feel. Yes, the beginning is often a blur of chemistry and magic, and that part is beautiful. But after that, love becomes a choice. A quiet daily practice. A willingness to show up, even when it’s not easy or simple or glowing.

I don’t think one way is right and the other is wrong. But I do think that difference shaped how we each responded when life became about more than just the spark, when it became about learning how to navigate the everyday moments together too.

I know you need space. Time to be in your own energy. And I truly respect that. I know that your solitude is sacred to you in the same way connection is sacred to me. I know now what that silence means. I understand why you need to distance yourself sometimes.

I realize I may have confused intensity with closeness, believing that constant emotional processing was necessary for love to thrive. But I think now of those quiet mornings, the way you’d make coffee while I was still waking up, how we could be completely ourselves without performance or explanation. That was intimacy too, perhaps the truest kind.

I’ve learned that my anxiety sometimes created urgency around conversations when what we both needed was patience. I see now that when I brought up concerns about daily life, like wanting to cook together sometimes or spend time outside our usual routine, it may have felt overwhelming when you needed our home to remain that peaceful refuge it had always been for you.

I’m also starting therapy to better understand my own patterns and learn healthier ways of handling my anxiety. Not to change who I am, but to be more aware of how my reactions affect the people I care about.

I’ve come to understand that sometimes what we were fighting wasn’t each other at all. It was a pattern we kept falling into without realizing. When something worried me, my instinct was to reach for you, to close the gap I felt. But I see now that my reaching could feel intense to you, especially if you were already feeling overwhelmed. In those moments, your instinct was to step back and find space, to keep things from getting worse. Neither of us was wrong. We were just protecting ourselves in different ways. But the more I reached, the more you pulled away. The more you pulled away, the more I reached. We both ended up feeling unsafe and unseen, when all we really wanted was the opposite: to feel close and secure.

I know that when you stepped back, it wasn’t because you didn’t care. It was your way of keeping us both safe when things felt too intense. I see now that my own responses, like needing immediate reassurance or clarity, probably made it even harder for you to stay present. We were both doing our best with what we knew how to do.

I understand now that when things between us felt deeper and more real, it might have stirred up some difficult feelings. Maybe thoughts like “this is getting complicated” or doubts about whether we were right for each other. I see now that those feelings weren’t necessarily about the relationship being wrong, but about how vulnerable real intimacy can feel. Sometimes the closer we get to someone, the scarier it becomes, not because something is wrong, but because something matters so much.

I also want to say something about this idea that I should be with someone “better.” I know that might have come from a place of protection, like you were trying to spare me from being disappointed. But here’s what I need you to know: I didn’t choose you by accident. I didn’t love you because I didn’t know better. I chose you because of who you are, not despite it.

I see you. Not the version of yourself you think you should be, or the one you worry isn’t enough, but you, exactly as you are. The way you get quiet when you’re thinking deeply. How you need time to process before you can find your words. The gentleness in how you make coffee in the morning. Your dry humor that catches me off guard. Even the parts of yourself you might wish were different, I don’t need them to change. I look at all of it with such fondness, such genuine affection. You don’t have to be perfect to be treasured.

I’m not asking you to meet me in the exact same way I reach out. I just want to be able to reach at all, and know that you won’t disappear because of it.

I’ve been learning that the most meaningful connections aren’t the ones without any bumps. They’re the ones where people find their way back to understanding, even after missing each other for a while. That’s why I still believe in what we had, and what we could have again if we both wanted it. Not because it was perfect, but because it was real.

If you’re reading this and your first instinct is to pull away, I get that. It’s okay if this feels like a lot. It’s okay if your first response is silence, or needing time to process. That’s not a failure. That’s just your way of staying safe, and I understand that now.

You don’t have to say anything right now. You don’t have to have the perfect words. I just want you to feel safe, not cornered, not judged, not analyzed.

There’s no pressure to explain anything. No requirement to have the right words. Just know that if your heart softens one day and you think of reaching out, I’ll still be open to it. Not waiting with conditions, just waiting with kindness.

If you ever feel like walking the long way home again, I’d be glad to meet you halfway.

P.S.: I want you to know that I never judged you or criticized you in any way, and I’m sorry that you sometimes felt that way. I see now how carefully you’ve built your world to survive, and I didn’t always know how to approach that part of you properly, the part that’s had to carry so much, quietly, for so long. But I would have waited longer, if I’d known that’s what you needed. And maybe now I am, just not with urgency or demand, but with openness.",10,1754893317.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,5,0.92,False

Male 36. I'm interested on Jungian perspective of my dream. The night before I was dreaming that I'm in some kind of a party and notice that my upper front tooth is kinda wobbling, i touch it and it falls out. I put my finger to my gums and its a little blood and a tooth missing. I clench my fallen out tooth in my fist and calmy walk to the bathroom to check on myself in the mirror. I put a smile on and there's a missing tooth. Instead of worrying I just put a big smile on my face, start to laugh and think to myself - damn I look like a hillbilly and I wake up. 

In context of whats happening in my conscious life - I deal with a lot of uncertainty, i quit my job a year ago to pursue my goal of setting up a small training to business to help people who are dealing with burnout, chronic fatigue - basically I work as a mental health first aider. The business has no traction for a span of few months and sometimes I think was the risk worth it ...

Now the dream. I believe I know that Jung says teeth is the perception of self to others, so basically how people view me as. Missing tooth ? Maybe they can see me as a struggling man ? Maybe a man that has lost something ? P.s. not long ago i've met my ex girlfriend that I really loved alot, we had a coffee. 

Laughing at my misfortune ? I believe it symbolizes resilience and my positive outcome to life. As far as I remember myself no matter how hard I've had it in life I always ended up wet, but not going under. I always said to myself - it's hard, but I'll make it out somehow. 

So yeah, my appointment to my therapist is only on Friday, so any of you Jungian specialists might want to give your perspective ?
