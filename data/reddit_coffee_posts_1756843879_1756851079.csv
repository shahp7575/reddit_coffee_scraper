1n6x6cz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6x6cz,Need help decorating living room w/ grey couch,"I‚Äôm dying for some suggestions to help redecorate my living room! The only thing that needs to stay is the couch. I just want it to feel cozy and have some more browns, beiges, greens. I like the organic modern style, but can‚Äôt figure out how to make it work with this couch.

The last image is how my living room used to look, but I hated it. I was trying to make it feel warmer, but it just wasn‚Äôt working. The chairs and coffee table are gone now because they got damaged.

I understand that a rug, pillows, blankets, artwork would help the space, but I have no idea where to start or how it should look to make things cohesive. Any suggestions?",1,1756850901.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False
1n6x54j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Armor/comments/1n6x54j/antiquing_aging_steel_armor/,Antiquing / aging steel armor,"First, I do not have any practical experience with owning and maintaining armor, though I have several blades that are primarily for costuming purposes.

Second, I have done a fair amount of internet searches, including both r/armor and r/bladesmith, before posting.

I have been cast in a local fantasy fair coming up this October and the base concept is a crusader who has been living in the fey realm for hundreds of years. Starting with a limited budget, I have ordered non-enclosed greaves and bracers from Epic Armoury, and a visored helm. What I am looking for, is a way of taking the commercial shine off and doing a DIY aging / antiquing / patina without actually rusting the steel to make the character look ancient.

What I have found most recommended is:

* Degrease steel
* Thoroughly work over with fine steel wool
* Clean and dry
* Treat with acid - instant coffee or lemon juice
* Clean and dry
* Apply sealant - oil or clear coat

My questions to the community are: What is the best method for getting the affect I am looking for? Is there another product than coffee or lemon juice that would work best? Is there anything else that I haven't considered?

Overall Build: Average height, above average weight, build is stocky, with disproportionately developed legs. 

Hair: Shoulder length, straight to wavy, dark brown. Generally worn down. 

Scars/body mods: Numerous scars, disproportionately located on left arm and legs, with two prominent linear scars spaced about 1 inch apart on the back of the left hand, an oval burn scar on the left forearm, and a single track mark on the inside of the left elbow. Single prominent linear scar on chin. Neither pierced nor tatooed. 

Dress: Generally T-shirts or jumpers and cargo pants, with a small number of collared shirts maintained for formal events. (These have not been used in multiple years) 

Every Day Carry: Keys worn on lanyard, black genuine leather wallet, phone, earbuds.

Living Environment: 500 foot studio in a rough neighborhood that I can't ever seem to keep as clean as I'd like. Walls adorned with art made by family. A dusty sewing machine sits next to a desktop computer on the floor, plugged into a small TV on a desk across from a coffee table and loveseat. The coffee table is the oldest thing in the apartment. In the corner sits a bookshelf with a latin course's textbooks prominently displayed, an invitation to a summer program at Columbia Law and Certamen awards are displayed, though they're dusty, like everything else on the shelves. A high school cap and gown are trampled underfoot in the closet. Several needles, syringes, a bottle of white oval pills, and a vial of prescription medicine sit on the desk near the keyboard and mouse. 

Transportation: 1950s Schwinn bicycle and late 90s Honda Accord with temporary plates. The bike is painted in authentic Schwinn paint, but this paint is damaged in multiple places. The Honda has a dent on the hood and rust around the wheel wells.

Points Scorable:

1 point for each of gender, sexuality, age, religious afilliation and race.

2 points for highest level of educational attainment, with 1 bonus point to be awarded if you can figure out why it isn't higher, and an additional one if you can deduce my relative class rank.

1 point for each of my 3 major mental diagnoses, with discretionary bonus points for detail

1 point for profession, with bonus points if you can deduce my level of experience.

1 point for deducing the state of my relationship with my family

The Seattle Mariners (73-65) and Tampa Bay Rays (68-69) clash Tuesday in a playoff-impacting battle where the only thing less reliable than either team‚Äôs offense is a blindfolded batter guessing pitch speeds. The Mariners, led by Bryan Woo‚Äôs 2.95 ERA and 166 strikeouts, face the Rays‚Äô Drew Rasmussen, who‚Äôs as cool under pressure as a frozen margarita in July. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a stathead who‚Äôs *also* a stand-up comic.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Statisticians‚Äô Snack Mix

The Rays are slight favorites (-102), implying a 50.6% chance to win, while the Mariners hover at +185 (49.4%). The total is set at 7.5 runs, with the under heavily recommended. Why? Both starters are ERAs in disguise‚Äî*efficient, quiet, and slightly unsettling*.

* **Bryan Woo**: Imagine a pitcher who‚Äôs had five outings without allowing an earned run. That‚Äôs not a typo‚Äîit‚Äôs Woo‚Äôs season. He‚Äôs the anti-fireworks show: 25 of his 26 starts have gone six innings or more. His WHIP (0.98) is tighter than a single-tapper at a buffet.
* **Drew Rasmussen**: Tampa‚Äôs rookie phenom has a 2.64 ERA and hasn‚Äôt surrendered more than two earned runs since July. His 7.8 K/9 isn‚Äôt flashy, but it‚Äôs consistent‚Äîlike a microwave that always heats your coffee to exactly 160¬∞F.

The Mariners, however, are a statistical trainwreck offensively. Over the last 15 days, they‚Äôre 21st in runs scored, 26th in batting average, and their OPS (collective .650) would make a toddler cry. The Rays aren‚Äôt much better (.680 OPS), but they‚Äôve won four straight, including a 10-2 drubbing of Seattle last night.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Ray Gun Power

The Rays‚Äô recent win was a Shane Baz masterclass: six shutout innings to end an eight-game losing streak. It‚Äôs the baseball equivalent of a phoenix risin

Wanted to get some outside eyes on it (other than ChatGPT lol). I realize it‚Äôs a lot packed into a short amount of time, but is it unrealistic? Are there any major red flags I should be aware of? We‚Äôre trying to follow decent weather patterns as best as possible.  I‚Äôm worried parts of it might feel rushed, especially trying to squeeze in the W trek before winter fully sets in.

I got a new psychiatrist at the only other office in town that takes Medicaid, bc for 2 decades I couldn‚Äôt see a different psychiatrist, and I was treating my anxiety. (I‚Äôm off anxiety meds now, and tapering off risperidone too)

Anywho long story short, it‚Äôs an office for crisis intervention and severe mental health at poverty level, they kinda see people at the worst point in their treatment, but they take Medicaid. So theyre not a very fancy office, and theres stigma on being a patient there, but there‚Äôs no other Medicaid choices. 

This doctor went down the list with me, and said for each symptom I don‚Äôt have bipolar. He doesn‚Äôt believe I had actual psychosis, bc I knew in the moment I was hallucinating & called an ambulance for myself. He said they were most likely pareidolia hallucinations from delirium and not real psychosis. Which really makes sense, bc I had just had high dose ketamine infusions & I was in a lot of pain from chronic illness. 

He doesn‚Äôt think I ever had mania bc I relied on coffee to stay awake while studying for college, and that was the only time I functioned with less sleep. But that‚Äôs what my stupid family said for proof of me having mania. 

He agrees I need off risperidone, and agreed to do a slow taper of 0.25 less per month, and let me decide how long to take & said I can taper longer if I want. He doesn‚Äôt believe in people taking more than one drug at a time & said he believes in mono active treatment. 

Whatever‚Äôs clever is what works for me to taper off risperidone slowly, but yeah it‚Äôs pretty validating to have a doctor say I don‚Äôt have bipolar, when I knew I didn‚Äôt, but I‚Äôve been gaslit by my old doctor for 2 years. 

I was told for 2 years if I went off risperidone, an antipsychotic, that I would immediately go into mania, and I have no history of mania. So that was really nice. He also said at the least they should have given me beta blockers before prescribing klonopin, when I was younger, and I might actually try beta blockers once I‚Äôm off risperidone, bc I have some serious issues with anxiety. But that was the only medication he brought up as something I could try in the future. You know he had to throw at least one med at me. 

But yeah he typically sees patients who are court ordered to be there, or in a crisis, or just coming out of a crisis. He knows what bipolar with psychotic features looks like, and he said I don‚Äôt fit the mold whatsoever. ",1,1756850125.0,Antipsychiatry,0,1.0,False

Since 15, I‚Äôve held about 10 jobs, ranging from 3 months in food service, year long internships, and 3+ years at a coffee shop. All my employers have loved me, and I‚Äôve never been fired or anything like that, but here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm struggling. There‚Äôs been a handful of jobs I‚Äôve shadowed or done for a day and decided it wasn‚Äôt a right fit:

‚Ä¢ At 18 I started a boutique job directly after wisdom teeth surgery and right before starting college. I was anxious about starting college, and in pain from dry sockets and decided after two days I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it (this was going to be a temp job, about 2 weeks during their busy time, they luckily had a backup)
‚Ä¢ A job, also around 18, helping ticket sales at the football games at the local college. I shadowed (unpaid) and decided it wouldn‚Äôt be a good fit.
‚Ä¢ At 22 I moved to a new city and shadowed (unpaid) a local bakery for a day. It was really small and slow and just not my vibe, and again I decided it wouldn‚Äôt be a good fit
‚Ä¢And lastly, most recently, I shadowed someone who does dog walking and pet sitting. I again shadowed a day (unpaid) and got anxious due to the size of the dogs and worrying they would be able to get away from me during walks. Along with other houses needing more cleaning than actual pet sitting. 

I guess I‚Äôm worried these handful of flaky decision making outweighs all the good I‚Äôve done at other jobs and all the employers who have appreciated me. Obviously I wouldn‚Äôt put any of these past jobs on my resume that I shadowed, but it makes me feel like I‚Äôm a bad worker or ‚Äújob hopping‚Äù. 

I guess I‚Äôm just hoping for anyone who can relate or ease my anxiety about these mistakes. Thanks!

* Studying: 2-4 hours a day, 5 times a week
* Exam results: Mostly C's and B's, rarely an A
* Stuck and frustrated with my academic performance because i knew deep-down i could do way better

What I Changed:

Study Routine -->

\- 8AM to 2PM, 4PM to 8PM (i got sick one time, except that i sticked with routine)

\- Active learning techniques instead of passive reading

\- Consistent daily studying with clear goals

\- Used Pomodoro mostly, 25/5, 30/10, 50/10, 52/17, blocking my phone with forfeit as I did

Lifestyle -->

\- Increased water intake (minimum 2L per day)

\- Improved sleep quality (consistent 6-8 hours)

\- Regular, balanced meals (2 meals a day as a student is a lot for me)

\- Reduced random social media scrolling, deleted instagram, no more yt shorts

\- Took short breaks during study sessions

Physical and Mental changes -->

\- Lost 2 kg, I eat 2 meals a day and sometimes it's not enough

\- Unfortunately, drinking too much coffee and tea

\- Under-eye bags slightly worse because I study on laptop all day long

\- Mental clarity SIGNIFICANTLY changed, I can almost focus whenever i want in 5-10 mins and lock in for 3-4 hours

\- More consistent energy, tea and coffee helps a lot but probably not that healthy

\- Better mood, I sleep better because I kinda am proud of myself for studying consistently so far

Results

\- More confident in my studies, I'll have exams soon i might update results

\- Better overall learning experience

\- Healthier routine (except too much coffee)",3,1756849723.0,GetStudying,0,1.0,False

Probably one of the best, looking back. The alarm would go off at 7 a.m., and like magic, after a series of negociations with myself, I'd find myself at 8:15 a.m. pulling on clean jeans while brushing my teeth. The classic ""I'm running late"" routine.

I tried everything. Putting my phone in the bathroom. Horrible ringtones. But my morning self was a genius at finding excuses and going back to sleep (Seriously, I've actually wondered if my morning self is the same person).

Then I had an idea that was both simple and diabolical. I used one of those automation apps (like IFTTT or Tasker, for those who know them) to create a dead simple rule on my phone.

The concept: if the main alarm is turned off AND a ""snooze"" alarm (the one at 7:09) goes off, then my banking app automaticaly makes a ‚Ç¨5 transfer.

The really funny part was choosing who got the money. It had to be something that would really piss me off, but without going to far (like, you know, your ideological opposite).

I searched and found a gem: a protection society for city pigeons. I have nothing against pigeons personaly, but the idea of paying ‚Ç¨5 so that a flying rat could have a better day than me was just unbearable.

Funding the well-being of the animal that has shat on me several times and gives me side-eye was challenging enough.

The first morning, the alarm rings. I have the Pavlovian reflex to tap the screen to grab those precious nine minutes. The moment my finger gets close, I remember my setup. I picture my hard-earned money turning into seeds for flying rats.

I litteraly jumped out of bed. It was an incredibly powerful motivation.

This system has been in place for two months now. My bank account is untouched and the pigeons will never see the color of my money. I get up at 7 a.m., without fail.

I have time to meditate, read a few pages, have a coffee while looking at the horizon lol. My life is calmer.

It's a bit of a radical method, I'll give you that. But it showed me that to change a habit, sometimes you have to create an immediate and really, really anoying consequence.",7,1756849674.0,getdisciplined,0,0.89,False
1n6wnnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/trustyconsumer/comments/1n6wnnq/why_choose_cooceer_x8_blood_pressure_monitor/,Why Choose COOCEER X8 Blood Pressure Monitor Review for Reliable Home Health Tracking?,"The COOCEER X8 Blood Pressure Monitor and I have been inseparable for a few weeks now, and I can safely say this device deserves some attention. Designed for at-home monitoring, this sleek and surprisingly lightweight gadget takes accuracy, usability, and convenience seriously. With its user-friendly features and thoughtful design, it promises a home blood pressure tracking experience that's not only efficient but also comfortable. That said, no product is perfect. Let‚Äôs dive into an honest personal review to see where the COOCEER X8 shines and where it might need some fine-tuning.

**Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment I unboxed this blood pressure monitor, I noticed its robust yet modern finish. Sometimes these medical devices can look a little clinical or bulky, but this one manages to feel approachable. Its compact size‚Äî5.7 x 3.7 x 2.3 inches‚Äîmakes storage and portability a breeze. The large, high-definition LED backlit display is a standout feature. Whether I'm working under dim lighting in the evening or my father is glancing at it without his glasses, the oversized numbers are crisp and easy to read. The cuff, with its adjustable range of 8.7 to 16.5 inches, didn't pinch or slide around during usage, which is a major plus when you work with it daily. However, I did notice that the device‚Äôs outer casing could have felt slightly more premium, given its promising performance.

**Performance and Accuracy**  
Nothing beats the reliability of a device when it comes to health monitoring. The COOCEER X8 claims an accuracy deviation of ¬±3 mmHg, and in my tests, it seems to deliver. I‚Äôve cross-checked its readings with another hospital-grade professional monitor, and the results were nearly identical. This consistency is reassuring, especially when managing a family history that demands vigilance with blood pressure fluctuations. Whether it‚Äôs my morning cup of coffee or a post-workout reading, the COOCEER X8 has effortlessly adapted to different scenarios.  

**Check if COOCEER X8 Blood Pressure Monitor is right for you‚Äî[Grab it here on Amazon.](https://thepressureexperts.com/link/b0cd2dq7pw/)**

**Ease of Use for All Ages**  
Simplifying health tracking for the entire household, this blood pressure monitor is so intuitive that even less tech-savvy users can navigate it without breaking into a sweat. My mother, who is generally not the biggest fan of fiddling with gadgets, had no issues operating the one-click measurement feature. A quick press of the button initiates the process, and within seconds, you have your results on the bright display. This ease extends to memory settings as well: the device supports two user profiles, each capable of storing up to 99 readings. Tracking long-term trends was incredibly helpful when I discussed health data with my doctor. However, I wonder if the memory function would be more beneficial if it supported date and time stamps‚Äîa feature missing here.

**Upsides**  
- The large LED backlit screen makes reading values easy for older users.  
- Adjustments through the comfortable cuff ensure there‚Äôs no pinching or irritation.  
- Supports two users with a total of 198 memory slots, which works well for families or couples tracking BP.  
- Consistent readings with remarkable accuracy.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The lack of date and time-stamped storage for readings might make it challenging for users needing detailed long-term logs.  
- Its predominantly plastic housing feels slightly less premium than one might expect.

**Health Monitoring Made Reliable**  
With a busy schedule, finding time for regular visits to the doctor can sometimes be tricky. That‚Äôs where having a reliable and easy-to-operate device like this becomes so valuable. What particularly strikes me about the COOCEER X8 is that it removes the guesswork from health monitoring. It empowers users‚Äîwhether it's a senior adjusting to new health routines or me keeping track of random high-pressure spikes after stressful days at the office.

**Product Competitors**  
Other blood pressure monitors like the Omron Platinum or the iHealth Clear offer stiff competition. Omron devices are often renowned for their slightly superior build quality and app integration, but they come at a higher price point. The iHealth Clear impresses with its smart connectivity, yet some customers have raised concerns over its cuff‚Äôs durability. In comparison, the COOCEER X8 focuses on accessibility and comfort, making it ideal for users who prioritize the ease of manual operation over tech features. It‚Äôs a trade-off, but a worthwhile one for many families like mine.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering its features‚Äîparticularly accuracy, a sizable memory capacity, and user-friendly design‚Äîthe COOCEER X8 offers excellent value. I‚Äôve tested a few alternatives within its category, and it hits a good balance between affordability and performance. Given the increasing number of people relying on at-home monitoring for early detection of health issues, this device bridges a gap for everyday users needing straightforward but reliable functionality. Considering these features, I‚Äôd categorize it as one of the smarter spending choices in its range.

I have been with my wife for 9 years, married for 4. Even now, she still talks about things I did when we were first getting to know each other. Back in my single days I was a playboy, but on our very first date I had a strong feeling she might be the woman I would one day marry. Because of that, I naturally cared about her comfort and convenience from the beginning.

One example is when I started keeping feminine products at my place. I knew nothing about them, but since she visited often I did not want her to have an emergency and not have what she needed. Years later she asked how I knew which ones to buy. The truth is I had no idea. I just grabbed the three most expensive options and assumed one would work ü§£.

Another memory is from about three weeks into dating. I stayed the night at her place and we had breakfast the next morning. She went on a thirty minute rant about a coffee machine she wanted. By then I had already learned two things about her. First, she had a strong passion for coffee. Second, she was the type of person who would spend generously on others but cut corners for herself. That same day I went out and bought two coffee machines. One was the exact model she had been talking about and I gave it to her. The other was a cheaper one that I kept at my place. At the time I did not drink coffee, but I wanted her to have the option when she stayed over. 

There are laundry list of examples like these. I mention these because even though these were nine years ago, she still talks about them. I'm only now realizing that those small actions had a big impact on her. To clarify, I still do things like this. These are just what comes to mind. To me, these type of actions doesn't mean much.  My mind will  see a problem or a possible problem and I act on it. That is just how I think.

Now and only now it's registering in my brain when my wife calls me a fixer.",1,1756849423.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I mentioned that i genuinely don't know if co-ferments have made my palate lazy (don't want this to turn into a co-ferment war, i drink them, as i drink washed coffee), or the demand for 'clean, sweet and juicy' coffees had waned, so producers were focusing on what makes them money.

A few mentioned that those special washed coffees still exist, they're just rarer and more expensive, and with the current trend towards big, bold 'flavours' in coffee, it makes little business sense as a green buyer to buy the special washed coffee when you can buy a co-ferment for half the price that will sell more (and connect more) with their customer base.

So, i guess my question is two-fold, do we/you still value washed coffee and do you see the trends changing back towards more traditional processing in time or are co-ferments here to stay? ",19,1756849312.0,pourover,20,0.91,False
1n6wg2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n6wg2e/my_grandfather_battled_the_kriegsmarine_and_im/,My Grandfather Battled The Kriegsmarine... And I'm Honoring His Last Request (Part 6),"Sleep brought no relief. Not even Aria‚Äôs warmth, not even the bone-deep exhaustion of a rather... acrobatically enthusiastic... night spent trying to forget, could keep the nightmares at bay. The things in the deep waited for me, patient and certain.

I dreamed of the city again. This time I wasn‚Äôt above it, looking down at it, I was in it. Swimming through streets unbroken yet abandoned, the water sliding into me and through me as easily as breath. I drifted past merchants‚Äô stalls lining vast plazas, towers of cyclopean stone rearing all around. And on those stalls‚Ä¶ relics from every age. A Roman gladius, its blade furred with rust, laid out on sealskin pillows beside vinyl records from the 1970s. Cheap dollar-store toys nestled against Ming dynasty vases. All of time‚Äôs debris, gathered and drowned.

And through it all, I felt the weight of eyes on me. Watching and measuring. Gauging me against some test that I neither understood nor wanted to understand. 

Then I saw a flash of movement! The city was not empty. I spun in the water, twisting this way and that, desperate to catch a glimpse of what stalked me. But they were always just out of sight, slipping into shadow, or vanishing behind walls, retreating the instant I turned. My frustration boiled into terror, because I knew what they were doing. They weren‚Äôt chasing me. They were herding me. Driving me ever closer to the gate‚Ä¶ that wicked arch looming above it all. And beyond it, in the fathomless black, I felt the beast waiting.

In my despair I tried to scream at them. Come out, face me, fight me, kill me! Anything but this endless haunt. Anything but being driven beneath that stone arch, its black stone twisting with patterns that made no sense to the eye. But when I opened my mouth‚Ä¶ no scream came.

The song did.

It slipped out of me, beautiful and terrible. A baritone note, pure and clear, carrying my defiance through the water. Not words, but a tune. My horror and frustration poured out as music... uncanny, haunting, and uncontained. The city drank it in, my curse transfigured into something lovely.

The arch rumbled in answer, stone groaning like the earth itself was listening. And then, from the black hollows of the city, from the hidden places out of sight... they came. Not in body, not yet. In voice. 

Clear, feminine voices rose to meet mine, weaving themselves into the tune. 

It was wondrous and cursed harmony. 

A call and response of the damned and his tormentors! 

It was a dirge to drown the world, to damn it in song and heart-rending beauty.

Shapes flickered at the edges of sight. Fins slicing the water. Flashes of too-sharp grins. Black eyes gleaming. Hands that were not hands at all.

I tried to choke it back, tried to silence myself, but the song tore out of me unbidden now, pouring like breath, like blood from a wound, pouring and staining the water red. And behind me, the gate rumbled again, eager for its choir to gather.

I woke gasping, breath ragged, choking on something caught in my throat. I forced it down, sucking air until my chest stopped seizing... only to feel a hand, rough and cool, brush my bare shoulder.

It was not human! I felt the skin of some great white, disguised in human mask...

Touching me!  

I screamed. Instinct flung me out of the bed. My hand closed around Pop‚Äôs Colt on the nightstand, and I spun, barrel leveled.

Another scream met mine...clear, human, and terrified.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck, Eryk?!‚Äù

Jesus Christ! It was Aria, I was aiming a loaded gun at Aria! Not some stitched-together Nazi nightmare, not some cryptid risen from the deep. Just my wife, eyes wide and scared.

Of me. 

The truth hit me like a hammer: I‚Äôd mistaken the callouses on her musician‚Äôs fingers for sharkskin. 

Madness whispering lies in the dark.

My arm shook as I lowered the pistol.

Aria‚Äôs hands were trembling, but the fear in her eyes softened the instant she saw my face. She pulled the sheets around herself, armor against the autumnal chill, and she let out a shaky laugh.

‚ÄúGod, Eryk‚Ä¶ you scared the shit out of me!""

I offered a thousand thousand apologies and through them all she never bit me with harsh word. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got every right to be angry,‚Äù I rasped, collapsing into the bed and putting the gun back on the nightstand. My chest still heaved like I‚Äôd run a mile. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I pointed a gun at you. Christ, Aria. I don‚Äôt even...‚Äù

She shook her head before I could finish. ‚ÄúFor the billionth time... I‚Äôm not mad. You just spooked me. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

And then she was up, crawling onto my side of the sheets, pulling me into her arms. I collapsed against her, the weight of it all breaking loose in a shudder. My forehead pressed into her shoulder, and I whispered the truth raw.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve got the strength to keep going. Every time I open that damned journal it tears me apart.‚Äù

Her fingers threaded through my hair, steady as an anchor. ‚ÄúYes, you do,‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúYou have to. It‚Äôs what Pop wanted. And maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù She kissed my temple, soft as a blessing. ‚Äú‚Ä¶maybe if you push forward a little further, it won‚Äôt be half as scary as your mind‚Äôs making it. Or maybe there is something good found in the dark."" 

Her certainty settled into me, quiet but firm as she hummed and rocked me back and forth. Something good, found in the dark? 

Maybe she was right...

We drifted into the living room. Aria busied herself setting up for an early-morning Twitch stream, a quick round of 'Would You Rather' for her subscribers. Her voice lifted, casual and warm, as she checked her mic and fiddled with the ring light.

I sank into the couch, the cushions swallowing me whole, and stared at the blue-grey sharkskin journal on the coffee table. Its clasp gleamed faintly in the lamplight, patient, expectant.

I was afraid of what would come next.
But maybe something good lurked in the dark‚Ä¶

With Aria‚Äôs words echoing in my head, I reached for the journal. I‚Äôd pick it up again... where it felt safe to do so.


---

December 9th, 1946

Me and the last man left from my unit, a satchel-thrower named Kl√ºg, finally staggered into the heart of that ice-and-concrete labyrinth. I couldn‚Äôt tell you how long we walked. Minutes, hours‚Ä¶ it all blurred into one frozen shit-hole of madness. Twisted bodies. Experiments that should never have seen the light of day. 

Christ, I‚Äôll never scrub the sight of that pregnant dogfish-thing from my brain, or the vile shit that skinhead bastard was doing with it. Gonna take the strongest government hush-money whiskey they can find to drown that memory.

Kl√ºg hasn't spoken a word since. I think something broke in the man. He's picked up this wide eyed, caged rabbit look. And shit, I don't blame him. 

I don't understand why we didn't just turn back... We never even considered it. Just kept putting one foot in front of the other. 

Step, kill, burn, destroy, step. On and on. Over and over. Inch by inch and slaughter by slaughter. Trading our guns for Jerries, every time we ran dry or malfunctioned. 

We didn't stop to wait or even radio back to check in.

Hell, I had the Handie-Talkie on my belt but it was like I'd completely forgotten it. 

It was like being pulled forward. Like something wanted us to just punch through. Keep killing till we got there. 

To that final door. 

To her. 

The place opened up into a rotunda carved of ice and concrete. Looked like an observatory at first, but instead of a platform pointing toward the stars, this one led down. A great shaft yawned in the middle of the room, a steel staircase twisting down into lightless dark. 

Movement stirred on the far side. Instinct snapped both of us into position, commandeered German weapons at our shoulders, fingers already tightening on the triggers.

But these weren‚Äôt Jerries. Not gray, not black, not blood-red robes with bald head and mutilated faces. 

These bastards wore green. Blue. Good old American beige.

Our boys.

And at their head, calm as a Sunday preacher walking into chapel, strode Mercer. The ghost himself. Purple eyes flat, unreadable, like he‚Äôd just strolled through hell‚Äôs front gate and didn‚Äôt bother to knock.

I had never been more grateful to see that phantom son of a bitch in my life.

‚ÄúLieutenant Commander Fauster,‚Äù Mercer said, calm as ever. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd given you up for dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúHell of a howdy-do, Mercer,‚Äù I shot back, crossing the distance and seizing his hand in a grip that probably dripped more blood than sweat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, thanks for asking. Don‚Äôt mind the busted leg. Or the fact I‚Äôm painted in gore head to toe. Simple skiing accident. You know how these things go.‚Äù

His mouth twitched, might‚Äôve been a smile, might‚Äôve been a tic, but his eyes stayed flat and cold.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Mercer said dryly. ‚ÄúYou smell awful too. Add that to your list of complaints... right under ugly. Though I think your mother is at fault for that one.‚Äù Then, with an honest, sunny grin, he added, ‚ÄúBut at least you‚Äôre still alive.‚Äù

It threw me for half a heartbeat. 

That grin didn‚Äôt belong in this place, and it struck me just how damned young he was. Twenty-four, maybe twenty-eight at the outside. Too young to be the kind of ghost he already was.

‚ÄúThanks, and fuck you too,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúHow long have we been out of it?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe three hours,‚Äù Mercer said, like he was announcing the weather. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made two trips back to the fleet. Nearly two hundred men are in full possession of the base now. Resolute and the destroyers are chewing through the minefield. They‚Äôll be here in a couple of hours.‚Äù

I just stared at him. Three hours? For me and Kl√ºg, it had been a lifetime in the dark and ice. Nothing but blood, ichor, screams, and things no man should ever see.

Mercer, though, just looked past me, calm as a surveyor tallying columns. ‚ÄúTruth is, they could‚Äôve held us longer. They had the guns. The fuel. Even the numbers, once you count whatever they hadn‚Äôt already‚Ä¶ repurposed.‚Äù His lip curled faintly. ‚ÄúBut the madmen in charge didn‚Äôt build this place to be defended. They built it to play. They cannibalized their own garrison for experimentation. I've looked through some of their documents on our push. They were obsessed with their little horrors, complacent at the thought no one would ever find them here. When we struck, they were brittle. Hollow.‚Äù

He glanced back at me, those strange purple eyes flat as ever. ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt a fortress, Fauster. It was a laboratory with delusions of grandeur.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell that to the seven dead guys I‚Äôve got,‚Äù I snapped. My voice cracked harsher than I meant, but Christ, I‚Äôd earned it.

Mercer didn‚Äôt flinch. He just held my gaze. ‚ÄúOur number‚Äôs already climbed to twenty-one,‚Äù he said evenly. ‚ÄúTwenty-one dead and thirteen injured on our side.‚Äù He let it hang there a second, heavy as lead. Then his voice dropped lower. ‚ÄúBut even still‚Ä¶ they had nearly four hundred.‚Äù

He actually shuddered, that cold mask cracking for a heartbeat. ‚ÄúMost were malnourished, panicked. Or‚Ä¶‚Äù His jaw clenched. ‚Äú‚Ä¶twisted.‚Äù

I was about to ask him what he‚Äôd seen. Hoping to trade some stories of the blood and shit I‚Äôd waded through... get some of it off my chest...when a scream split the air.

Real, feminine... and in perfect English.

‚ÄúSomebody please help me!‚Äù

The hair on my arms shot up like I‚Äôd been galvanized. Mercer‚Äôs hand blurred; his .45 was out of the shoulder rig before the last echo faded. Kl√ºg and I snapped our rifles toward the source: That gaping, steel-lined shaft cut straight into the ice.

I limped toward the shaft without a second thought, winding my way down the steel steps while Mercer‚Äôs sailors fanned out above to lock down a perimeter. No hesitation. No second guesses. I led, Mercer at my back, Kl√ºg covering the rear.

I stumbled once, my bad leg giving way, but Mercer‚Äôs free hand shot out and steadied me without a word.

The deeper we went, the worse it got. That damned buzz, the same gnawing tone at the edge of hearing, grew louder, drilling into my skull. And under it, voices... chanting.

The air glowed sickly red as emergency lamps pulsed in perfect time with the words. German, Latin, and some third thing... a bastard tongue I couldn‚Äôt place, rough and gurgling, like a man gargling day-old coffee grounds. They were all woven together in this awful tonal drone with that buzz as a bassline. 

And when we finally reached the bottom, the scene hit me like something torn out of Victor Frankenstein's wildest nightmares. 

We were under the water. A hexagonal chamber, every wall made of thick glass, the black sea pressing in from all sides. Symbols daubed in blood crawled across those panels, twisting shapes that crawled like crabs if I looked too long.

Half a dozen Kraut cultists knelt in the chamber, their bodies bent low, scraping the floor in worship. All of them faced the dais at the center. And standing there, raised above them, was the head freak himself.

But it wasn‚Äôt his presence that nearly made me drop the stolen STG-44 in my hands.

It was what he was doing.

And who he was doing it to.

It was‚Ä¶ well, fuck me, I don‚Äôt have another word for it. A mermaid.

Not like the pin-ups and tattoos sailors get inked on their arms. This was flesh and blood and terrible beauty. Her black hair spread out in the tank like a spill of ink, whipping with every desperate thrash as she fought to keep her head below the waterline. 

But her lower half...was no fairy tale. Not a dainty fishtail that was just scales and fairy glitter. It was the tail of a hammerhead shark, thick with muscle, built to drive her through the deep at killing speed.

She was half exposed to the open air, trapped in this sort of a concrete altar, mixed with a baptismal font. Just enough water to cover the lower half of her, leaving her all-too-womanly torso exposed. 

And that sick bastard on the dais had a knife in her.

He was cutting into her while she still lived... peeling a strip of skin just under her breast like he was unwrapping a prize. Or scaling a tuna. 

She screamed, raw and human, before he backhanded her across the mouth and laughed. Then he leaned close, babbling at her in broken, frantic German, eyes wild with joy.

We couldn‚Äôt fire. Not without hitting her, or (worse for us) punching through the glass and bringing the whole goddamn ocean down on our heads.

So we went in the old way.

We broke from cover as one ravaging beast, boots hammering the steel floor, knives and bayonets flashing cold in the red light.

The cultists barely had time to turn. One of them squawked in shock before Kl√ºg‚Äôs blade slid up under his ribs. Mercer moved like smoke, his .45 forgotten, that naval knife of his opening throats in clean, ugly lines. I took the nearest bastard head-on, bayonet ramming through wool and bone with a crack that jolted all the way up my arm. 

I don't think the sound of a puncturing sternum has ever been so beautiful.

The chanting collapsed into shrieks, chaos crashing through their ritual.

The high priest on the dais spun, blood still dripping from his blade, his wide eyes snapping from us to the girl thrashing in her tank.

And for the first time, I saw his face. It was a ruined wreck of a thing. He'd had his nose chopped off at some point, the hole pulled all the way open with what looked like barbed wire. His eyes were bulging and the evil bastard blinked sideways. Stitches from a thousand self-inflicted surgeries crawled across his skin. Some still oozing infection... And other things that crawled back in after they had taken a look. 

Those bald freaks didn‚Äôt offer much of a challenge. We butchered them quick. Clean as killing chickens. Loud, brutal, efficient, and over in seconds.

But this last man had the bearing of someone who was going to be a problem. 

When the last of them hit the deck, I turned toward the lead Kraut, letting his followers body slump off my bayonet with a thump. 

He‚Äôd already spun back to the girl, cutting away like he was merely conducting a study while his men died around him. She was begging him in broken German, voice thin and raw.

‚ÄúShut up, Schlampe!‚Äù he snapped in English. Then he hissed at me: ‚ÄúWhy are you here, American? You are disturbing important work.‚Äù

I started forward, bayonet low, and his hand came up fast. The knife kissed her throat. A thin line of red welled under the blade.

I froze. My guts turned to stone.

Mercer edged a half-step left, pistol sighted, but the barest shake of his head told me what I didn‚Äôt want to hear.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a chance I hit her. No good.‚Äù

I flicked my eyes to Kl√ºg, but he just gave the same grim shake. No shot.

The Kraut saw it. Smiled wide, bright and warm, like, some benevolent uncle leaning over the grill at a backyard barbecue. Some of his teeth writhed in his mouth like anemones, flexing against the gums.

And that smile never faltered as he pressed the blade harder to the girl‚Äôs throat. A bead of blood rolled down her collarbone, lost in the water below.

‚ÄúWould you like to see the power she holds, American?‚Äù he purred. ‚ÄúWhat she sings for in the deep?‚Äù

He rounded on me, knife still digging into her flesh. That‚Äôs when they came... thick, black tentacles, slick as oil, twisting up from beneath his robe and coiling over his shoulders. Not divine, not otherworldly. These were stitched, bolted and spliced together, like a stolen HAM radio. They twitched and writhed like a trophy he barely knew how to wear.

‚ÄúI can show y...‚Äù

The crack of a Springfield split the chamber.

The woman screamed as stone dust burst from the altar, the round burying itself less than an inch from her skull. The Doktor‚Äôs body jerked once, tentacles lashing wildly, before his headless frame slumped to the floor in a wet collapse. Gore sprayed across the tank, dripping down her pale skin like a baptism in blood and brain matter. 

Mercer, Kl√ºg, and I all spun, fumbling for targets. But there was no enemy... just one of the sharpshooters Admiral Kincaid had insisted on sending, calm as a statue on the staircase above, cycling another round into his rifle.

He gave us a crisp salute, as if to say: You‚Äôre welcome.

The kid finished sliding the bolt home on his rifle and went back up the stairs, calm as Sunday afternoon. But when we turned back to the girl in the tank, every one of us felt panic rise in our throats. Rifles came up without a word.

Because she had changed.

Gone were the pretty brown eyes, the pale skin, the soft mouth that could‚Äôve graced a sailor‚Äôs tattoo. What stared back at us now wasn‚Äôt a damsel.

It was a monster.

Her eyes were pits of black, with irises burning like coal furnaces in the dark. Her lips peeled back into a too-wide grin, her mouth ending just below her ears and rows of needle-like teeth glistening. Her hands now had sharp black talons, on fingers that bent at too many joints.

And then she thanked us. Not with words, but with a gesture. That monstrous smile widened, and her tongue... long, forked and utterly obscene... Slid out and licked the Nazi‚Äôs brains from her cheek, pulling them gratefully into her mouth one lick at a time. 

Like a child savoring the last drop of ice cream.

I snapped my rifle up, ring-sight square on her chest.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you?!‚Äù

She froze, and then her body began to ripple. Skin cracked, shimmered, and slid like a film being peeled away. In seconds the nightmare was gone, no more furnace eyes or rows of teeth... just the girl again. Soft and fragile, even with her shark tail. 

Big doe eyes blinked up at me, wide with terror.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù Her voice shook, spilling out between desperate breaths. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so, so sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean to frighten you. They‚Äôre starving us. They don‚Äôt feed us! We haven't eaten! Not since they took us!‚Äù

Tears welled in her eyes, sliding down her pale cheeks as she strained against the restraints, forced to keep her head above water. ‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt kill me.‚Äù

No way, I thought. No way am I letting this monster live. I was about to blow a hole in her, I swear I was, when she spoke again. 

‚ÄúI can help you!‚Äù she begged, voice breaking as her body strained against the bonds. ‚ÄúI know where they keep their‚Ä¶ their‚Ä¶‚Äù She faltered, searching for the word. Her black hair fanned around her in the water, as she thrashed against her chains. The chains dug into her pale white skin... ‚ÄúA large collection of floating vessels!‚Äù

My heart dropped into my boots.

‚ÄúA fleet?‚Äù I rasped. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying they have a fleet of ships?‚Äù

Her eyes lit, wide and eager, nodding fast enough to ripple the water. ‚ÄúYes! Yes, a fleet! A large one! I know where it is! I can help you destroy it!‚Äù

Mercer scoffed, eyes cold as steel. ‚ÄúA lie,‚Äù he spat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just trying to save its own skin. End it, Fauster.‚Äù

But‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt so sure.

The thought gnawed at me. They had too much stockpiled here. Too many crates, too much fuel, whole tankers brimming full. Not just for a handful of labs and one U-boat pen. No‚Ä¶ that was supply for something bigger. A fleet made a grim kind of sense.

I stared down the sight at her face, my finger tight on the trigger. She wept into the water, trembling, chains cutting into her arms. But in her eyes there was something else‚Ä¶ not just terror. Urgency.

If there was a rogue fleet out here, fueled and armed with whatever twisted cargo these freaks had cooked up‚Ä¶ Christ, they could ravage half the Atlantic seaboard before anyone knew what hit them.

I exhaled slow and let the barrel dip.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs lying, Mercer,‚Äù I said.

In a few clipped words I relayed what Kl√ºg and I had seen on our march, the crates, the tanks, the endless piles of munitions. I stressed the fuel, the sheer amount of it. Enough to keep a wolfpack hunting for months.

He fixed me with those strange purple eyes of his, unblinking, like he was prying my guts open. Trying to stare at my soul. 

‚ÄúWhat are you suggesting, Lieutenant Commander?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt flinch. I told him straight.

‚ÄúI think we hear her out. If what she says is true? If she can lead us to this fleet? We cut her loose, follow her word, and turn every last  German hull into a coral reef. And if it‚Äôs not true‚Ä¶‚Äù I let the rifle dip, but kept my finger curled on the trigger. ‚Äú‚Ä¶then so what? She‚Äôs one fish-lady. You think she can threaten an entire American task force on her own?‚Äù

‚ÄúHmmm.‚Äù Mercer‚Äôs voice was thoughtful, almost mild. But his eyes stayed flat, watching everything. I could see the engines turning in that ultra-pragmatic box he called a brain.

‚ÄúBut what of the song?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúThat sonic weapon they hit the Concord with‚Ä¶ we still don‚Äôt know its source. What if it‚Äôs her?‚Äù

That yanked me up short, cold right down to the roots.

I turned back to her, and raised the rifle again.  ‚ÄúWas that you? Did you do that? Can you‚Ä¶"" I wish there was a way to say that so that it sounded less stupid but I'm a sailor, not a poet. ""Can you mind control people?‚Äù

Her face crumpled. She nodded, grim and slow, flinching like the confession itself might kill her. ‚ÄúYes. Well, others like me. Not me. I can do nothing here, chained. But my sisters‚Ä¶ they can. If they hunger, they sing, and the sea obeys. But if the sea cannot provide."" She hesitated briefly and looked away. ""They can‚Ä¶ lure sailors to their deaths.‚Äù

My blood iced. Holy shit... she‚Äôd just admitted it. The weapon was real. It was looking at me with eyes the shade of warm cherry wood...

I raised the rifle, sight locked between her tear-brimmed eyes. We‚Äôd find that fleet on our own. Better to end it here and now before this thing turned on us...

But she cried out, desperate, words spilling fast:

‚ÄúBut! I can also stop it!‚Äù Her voice cracked, half plea, half promise. ‚ÄúI can shield you. Protect you from my sisters‚Äô song! I can make you safe! Please... I'm not some mindless beast! We can make a deal! Please don't kill me... Please have mercy..."" 

Mercer was silent and I was torn. If she could defend us from it, then the odds were better for us if we kept her with us. But if she turned on us... Well Mercer and I were fine, we'd been unaffected by the song, but we had well over a thousand other idiots to keep tabs on. 

Then Mercer spoke in a language I didn't recognize. It was old, and had a slightly musical cadence. Come to find out later, it was Gaelic. 

She responded eagerly, matching his speech. It was better than her English. The two of them went back and forth in a flurry, him harsh and accusing, her swapping between eager-to-please and pleading. 

I was confused and wondering what the hell those two were barking about. As they spoke Mercer looked more and more worried. 

When they had reached an agreement I guess, Mercer... Holstered his pistol. 

""Get her out of there."" He told me, walking back toward the staircase. ""Feed her, clothe her, and do not harm her. She will lead us to this fleet. There may have to be more terms in the future. Once you have her free, give her that book you are always scrabbling in. Have her write the contract and sign it. Then you sign it."" 

The idea churned my guts. I suddenly felt like a child. Every fairytale my mother had ever told me, as we huddled around our old pot-bellied stove, crawled into my brain like spiders. 

I turned my gun on him. ""What the fuck are you talking about, Mercer? You can't just say something like that then walk away!"" 

He sighed like a man tired beyond his years. ""My family comes from Ireland, Fauster. My father's side, anyway. There are stories about these... Creatures. Deals with farmers and sailors, both.  They can't break their promises. Get her to write it.""  

I shook my head, baffled. ""What? That's it?! You're betting my ass on some old ghost story your gramps told you?! Fuck you, Mercer!""

Mercer didn't look back up at me but I could see something in his eyes. Something haunted, like a man remembering the time he saw a ghost. ""I've studied this my entire life. I know what I'm talking about. Make the deal, Fauster."" 

""Why the hell do we need this? Or if we do need it, why don't you make the deal then?"" I demanded but lowered my gun. No way was I entering a pact of any kind with some hellspawn without knowing the why of it. 

""Because,"" he said solemnly, ""She wouldn't offer that... if she thought we didn't need it. If this..."" He spat the next word, ""thing is offering us this, it's because it's 'take my deal, or die mortal.' ""

I scoffed. ""How? Our ships are clearing the minefield, they can only have an equal force out here. Not more..."" 

He rounded on me, cutting me off, violet eyes blazing like a furnace. He delivered each word like a shot to my gut. ""They have a Bismarck-class hull! You thrice-damned fool! We can't fight that without help! We cannot wait until it heads south. We cannot wait for reinforcements!"" He was raving, hands moving wildly with his arguments... but I honestly didn't blame him. ""God knows what kind of havoc it could cause! So if we are to fight her... we must act now! And to sink it, we will need help!""

I gawked, openly, my blood cold in my veins. That was impossible. I tried to argue but my throat was dry. I swallowed and tried again. ""There were only two..."" 

He rammed his hand against the railing in frustration. ""We thought there were only two! We were wrong... Now, take the fucking deal!"" 

I tried and failed to come up with an argument. Christ, a ship that could kill from 20 miles away, with armor so thick 5 inch guns would just bounce off her hull like stones. We couldn't fight a monster like that. 

Take my deal, or die... Mortal. She was right. And she wouldn't have to lift a finger. 

I slung the rifle over my shoulder and walked to the tank where she babbled her thanks in a dozen different languages. 

It took forever to find the keys in the mess of Kraut gore. But I did and I undid the lady's chains. In a flurry of shifting skin, she stuck a bare, perfectly formed leg over the edge of the glass and held her hand out to me. I helped her down without a thought. Trying not to stare. 

She was so small, a full foot shorter than me... And stunning! I knew, rationally that a monster lurked beneath that skin but with God as my witness, no man could have looked at her in that moment and not been moved to tears. She was a dream on two feet, and absolutely comfortable in her nakedness. 

We dickered over terms. But I think we worked out something pretty solid. 

---

Here the writing in my grandfather's journal changed. It became flowing, almost elegant script. There were smudges, as if the person who wrote it, did so with hands that dropped water and smeared the ink.

---

I swear upon the god of sea and dreams to safeguard Maximillius Fauster, Sean Mercer, and Adolfo Kl√ºg from the song of my sisters, and to guide them and their crews against the fleet of ships against which they have set their hearts.

Let what is written never be broken nor undone by any force of this world.

In return, Maximillius Fauster shall preserve my safety, ensure I never starve, and remain my companion all my days. 

I shall do the same. So long as this journal endures, or until a new pact is struck.

If one breaks this oath, or destroys the vessel in which it is sealed, may their soul be driven into the earth‚Äôs blackness until the end of days, and their death be a torment... conceived only in Hell‚Äôs darkest dreams.

Signed,
Ursula, Matron of Ill'yoth

And 

Lieutenant Commander Maximillius E. Fauster

---- 

What is this? Why? Why did they do this? It doesn't look like a vow of servitude... Or dominion. It made them equal partners. 

Horror crept from my innermost soul like crabs crawling through a whalefall. The cadence was familiar. It bound two people together forever, to take care of each other. Damning them if either of them violated it...

It looked like wedding vows...

Oh Christ have mercy... It couldn't be true. I dove for the zebrawood box and dug through it. A picture, I needed to see a picture! 

I dug through all of the pictures and maps, scattering them like leaves in a storm. He had to have one, he had to have one! There was nothing in the box! So I ran through the condo and dug through old family photo albums, ripping and tearing through the pages. 

I found it. 

Oh God, no... 

Why? Why? 

It was a picture. Faded in those sepia tones of the 1940's. Pop in Long Island, out of uniform. The date on the back read April 23rd, 1947. 

His arm was around a woman. A face I'd never seen but that Pop talked about all the time. 

She was beautiful, with long dark hair that fell to her waist. Big expressive doe eyes that could easily melt the hardest of hearts. A body men would wage wars over. A perfect mouth that looked like sailors would get it tattooed. Slender, delicate hands sat on a stomach that was just starting to show signs of pregnancy. 

It was a picture of Pop's first wife.

It was a picture of the woman described in the thick, bloodstained pages of the journal.

It was a picture of Ursula.  ",1,1756849134.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

A couple of weeks ago I started a medication, low dose naltrexone, to help with disordered eating/weight gain. It has really helped me avoid overeating - my appetite is good for ""healthy"" foods and I am no longer thinking about junk foods that I had been overconsuming. So it is working as intended. The bonus is that I don't have the cravings for coffee anymore. Not even the 1 decaf in the morning. So I wanted to share this, if people are having trouble with relapsing or whatever.

1n6w64w,https://i.redd.it/q6sf38hhktmf1.jpeg,Searching: A Vow To Part (app: lera),"Chapter 1
Rona Lewis and Darren Williams had been in love for three years, and everyone in the company regarded them as a perfect couple. 

However, the car accident in their anniversary party three months ago had quietly changed everything. 

To save Darren, Khloe Flynn, his secretary, suffered severe injuries and memory loss in the car accident. The only person who could offer her a moment of peace was Darren. 

Rona always believed that she would have her old life back eventually. 

Until this moment, as she stood quietly outside the office... 

... 

Rona stood at the door of Darren's office, clutching the contract that the legal department was urging to be signed. 

She wanted to push the door open and walk in like she always did. Everyone in the company was aware of her relationship with Darren. So they never needed those formalities. 

But today, she gently knocked at the door after she held her hand over the door for a moment. 

Inside, there were rustling sounds coupled with the soft, fl**ting laughter of a woman. 

Rona felt her heart tightened, but she couldn't stop herself from pushing the door open. 

The scene inside the office poured a bucket of cold water on her head. 

Darren was leaning against the desk with Khloe practically nestled in his arms, who was delicately adjusting his tie with her slender hands. 

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows next to them, silhouetting them who were in**mate. 

Rona had a catch in her throat, then said, ""Darren, here are the documents...""

Then they both turned their heads. 

Khloe's face still carried a faint blush. A flicker of panic flashed in Darren's eyes but then he quickly regained his composure. He naturally distanced himself from Khloe and strode over to Rona. 

""Rona?"" He reached for the document and slid his fingers into hers, ""Why did you come up? You miss me?""

His hands were warm and dry, which Rona was familiar. 

For the past three years, he had secretly squeezed her hand under the conference table, held her waist at an annual parties to declare her identity, and draped a coat over her during late-night overtime with those hands. 

But now, she only felt the warmth of the hands was unbearably burning. 

Rona instinctively recoiled but Darren held it tighter. 

He whispered to her, when his breath brushing her earlobe, ""Don't overthink it. Khloe isn't feeling well.""

""Darren,"" Khloe's weak voice came from behind, ""My head is spinning.""

Darren obviously stiffened. 

Rona saw a momentary mind struggle in his eyes, which ceased quickly. 

He released her hand, turning back to Khloe, ""Does it hurt again? Should I call a doctor?""

Khloe shook her head, leaning softly against Darren, ""Just stay with me.""

She raised her tear-filled eyes to look at Rona, ""Ms. Lewis, may I ask you out? I'm not feeling well. I don't want see anyone at the moment.""

Rona's nails dug deep into her palm. 

Ever since the accident three months ago, Khloe had become weak like this, and Darren was the only one who could comfort her. 

Office gossip circulated that Khloe was injured saving President Darren, and this favor was enough to last a lifetime. 

""The documents are here."" Rona placed the contract on the coffee table and said in a steady tone, ""The legal department needs you to signed it as soon as possible.""

Darren, holding Khloe, frowned slightly, ""Rona...""

""I'm leaving now."" As Rona turned, she caught a glimpse of the fleeting smug smile on Khloe's face. 

As the door closed, she heard Khloe's tearful voice, ""Darren, am I interrupting you? But I'm really scared...""

Rona didn't linger and quickly headed toward the elevator. 

Colleagues in the hallway cast su**estive glances at her. 

The still considered Rona and Darren as the perfect couple in their office. 

But no one knew that every time Khloe called, Darren would drop everything just to be by her side. 

As the elevator doors closed, Rona finally allowed herself to take a deep breath. 

Her phone vibrated in her pocket, a text from her mother, Helena Randerson. ""The Johnson family has asked again. Have you made up your mind?""

For the first time in the past three months, Rona didn't hesitate but replied Helena. ""I agree to the arranged marriage with the Johnson family.""

Almost immediately, a call came through. 

""Why the sudden change of mind?"" Helena's voice was filled with surprise, ""Didn't you just say to wait a bit longer?""

""Just feel it's time to make a decision.""

""You don't sound right,"" Helena keenly noticed something wrong with Rona, ""Is it about Darren...""

""Mom,"" Rona interrupted, ""I want to come back.""

There was silence on the other end for a few seconds. ""Alright. I'll arrange an appointment with the Johnson family next month. You've thought this through, right?""

""Yes. As soon as my resignation is finished, I'll come back."" Rona hung up the phone and sent a message to the HR department. ""I decide to not renew my contract when it expires. Please process my resignation.""

Jade Lee, the HR Director of their company, replied promptly. ""This is so sudden, Rona. Shall I inform Darren? You know executive resignations require his signature for confirmation.""

Rona closed her eyes briefly, and replied Jade, ""Don't tell him yet. I'll handle it before the contract expires.""


Chapter 2
Back in the office, Rona retrieved a picture from deep in the drawer. 

It was a photo from a company event last year. Darren was holding her by the waist and whispering sweet words to her that only she could hear them. She was laughing brightly in the picture. 

Kaiden Saunders, Rona's assistant, knocked and entered, ""Rona, here's the new proposal from the marketing department.""

""Just leave it on the desk,"" Rona replied without looking up. Her fingers absentmindedly tracing the edge of the frame. 

Kaiden hesitated, ""That Khloe is here again. The receptionist said she saw her going upstairs to find Darren.""

When Rona looked up at her, Kaiden immediately fell silent. The office was enveloped in quietness. 

""Book me a ticket to Rontras,"" Rona said, ""for ten days later.""

Kaiden's eyes widened, ""Are you going on a business trip?""

Rona put the picture face down on the desk, ""No, I'm leaving.""

Sunlight continued to stream in through the window and fell on the plant that Darren had given her. It had started to wilt as it had been untended for three months. 

Rona touched the dry leaves, remembering what Darren had said when he placed it on her desk, ""It's just like you. You look strong on the outside but in fact you need to be taken good care of and protected.""

But now, he was busy taking good care of another girl. 

Her phone lit up with a message from Darren. ""Khloe was in a mood. I'm taking her home. Don't wait for me for dinner.""

Rona stared at the message for a long time until the screen dimmed. She recalled that rainy night three months ago. Darren had rushed into the emergency room holding Khloe, covered in bl**d, while she stood aside, clutching a rain-soaked anniversary gift. 

She should have realized then that some mistakes, once made, are beyond repair. 

... 

As night deepened, Rona sat by the bay window in the living room with a book open in her hands. 

The sound of someone opening the door with a key caught her attention. And she closed the book, and put a well-practiced smile on her face. 

""Rona?"" Darren entered, carrying an exquisite paper box, ""You're still up?""

""Waiting for you."" Her voice was gentle, as if there was nothing had changed. 

Darren approached, placing the box on the coffee table, and crouched down to meet her gaze, ""I got you the last chestnut cake from that dessert shop in the south of the city. It's your favorite.""

The box bore the logo of the popular shop known for its long lines. She had often talked about it and wanted to try it, but always gave up because of the long lines. 

""Thank you."" She took the cake. When her fingertips brushing against his warm hand, she quickly pulled her hand back. 

Darren noticed her distance keenly and sighed, ""Today, Khloe felt dizzy at the office...""

""I know,"" Rona interrupted with a perfectly practiced smile playing at her lips, ""She's still recovering, you should take care of her.""

He frowned slightly and tried to touch her face, ""You're angry.""

""I'm not."" She turned her head to back off and headed to the kitchen, ""Would you like something to drink?""

Darren followed. He wrapped his arms around her waist from behind, ""Come on. If I had been in the passenger seat that day, I'd be the one with amnesia and need to be taken care now. Khloe was just doing her job.""

Rona stood with her back to him. Her fingers clutched the edge of the counter unconsciously. 

She had heard the same words for countless times over the past three months. 

""I know."" She turned around to him with a familiar gentle smile on her face, ""I'm not one who would hold grudges.""

Darren visibly relaxed. He ki**ed her on her head, ""I know you are the most considerate.""

Considerate. A word that had put a thorn in her heart. 

Rona recalled the image of Khloe leaning against him earlier that day. That girl had never needed to be ""considerate.""

""Shall we eat the cake now?"" She changed the subject. 

""Sure."" Darren led her to the sofa, enthusiastically opened the box, ""I stood in line for nearly two hours just for it.""

The chestnut cake exuded a sweet fragrance. The gold leaf decorated on it was glinting under the light. 

Rona scooped a piece with a small spoon and tasted it. Though the sweetness melting on her tongue, she could taste no expected joy from it. 

""Is it good?"" He asked expectantly. 

""Yeah."" She nodded, offering a spoonful to him. ""Try this.""

Darren ate the cake she offered with satisfaction in his eyes, ""Glad you like it.""

He wiped the nonexistent cream from her lips, ""Shall we see a movie this weekend? We haven't had a date for a long time.""

""Sure."" She agreed quickly, though she was thinking about the flight ticket Rontras to ten days later. 

Darren seemed pleased with her compliance, and began chatting about work draping an arm around her shoulder. 

Rona listened quietly and occasionally responded him. 

The moonlight spilled through the window, casting the shadow of their entwined figures on the floor. They were seemingly inseparable. 

""Tired?"" Darren asked softly, noticing her absent mind. 

Rona leaned against his shoulder, ""A little.""

""Then go to bed early."" He ki**ed her forehead. 

In the bedroom, Darren quickly fell asleep. 

Rona lay on her side, watching his sl**ping face and thinking how, three years ago, when they were just together, he would always make her smile. But now, those sweet tricks could no longer touch her heart. 

She rose quietly and stepped onto the balcony. The night breeze was cool. The city's lights were twinkling like stars. 

Her phone screen lit up with a ticket confirmation message. 

Rona glanced back towards the bedroom, where Darren murmured her name in his dreams. 

She locked the screen of her phone and smiled silently.

So, it started last year new years eve, me and my girlfriend stopped smoking sigarets, stopped smoking weed and also stopped drinking coffee. 

That‚Äôs a good thing you would say, we are very proud how far we made it and I have to say, we are doing pretty good. We are known with what it does with you. Especially after 18 years it will take time. Sometimes we go on reddit and read story‚Äôs about other people who share there experiences. 

We have been through the hard stuff and been building our life. We go for walks, short walks, long walks, been sporting a lot and there is what keeps bothering me and my girlfriend. 

We are experiencing a lot of body pains, like sore knees, tired feet, stif shoulders, neck pains, lot of headaches, having dizzy moments. When I for example do chores in the garden my shoulders and neck hurt really bad. When we walk alot our feet hurt pretty much. For the record I am pretty much in shape. Can keep a good pace on bike or running. Got enough muscles. 

Doctors cannot find a thing. We are trying a lot, like magnesium, enough hydration, healthy food. Sure We make a lot more steps in comparison with our smoking life in the past.

So we are hoping there are people who experienced maybe a sort of the same things and are already further in the process. We are very curious and many thanks jn advance!!",1,1756848292.0,weedsigaretscoffee,0,1.0,False

There is a woman older than I am who lives directly across the street,, with her adult son.  They have no working car, and she gets disability plus a small monthly check from her extremely wealthy brother who travels the world.  She has an older sister who lives in a nearby town.  Both of them know she has no transportation, and certainly if she did she could not afford to maintain it herself.  Her son >should be< on disability for physical and psychological problems, but can't follow through on anything long enough to keep applying so that he gets it.  Also, he sees a doctor about once a month and a nurse friend of mine has told me that the doctor would referring the son for disability  if he thought that the son should be getting it.   She does qualify for food stamps and receive other public assistance.  

For about 2 months, she and I were going on walks around the neighborhood twice a day, and I was driving her on errands almost daily (to take her to get expensive addictive iced coffee for her son, cigarettes for her son, and groceries and other errands).  This was way far more driving than I ever like to do.  I need my car to last me awhile, for the duration.  She told me her story, very sad, and I am so glad I did not trust her enough to  tell her mine.  She was borrowing money from me to buy cigarettes and expensive coffees for her son, who, she says, is ugly to her if he doesn't get these.  Over the course of a month. she had borrowed $300 from me, telling me she was keeping track and she was going to pay me back, and lo and behold, she did!  But then a few days later she borrowed $200 back of the $300.  

Also, she was not at all considerate and respectful of my time.  Twice I took her to Walmart and ended up waiting for 30 minutes or more.  Truly I do not like Walmart or shopping in general, I get what I need and get out!   Only when we had gotten to the Walmart did she tell me she was going to be 30 minutes.  If I had known this ahead of time I could have brought a book!!  My bad for not thinking to ask!  Also, in general,  instead of thinking ahead and getting everything in one trip, she needed me to drive her places almost every day.   To give her credit, she does walk some long distances when she has to, but she sure can't walk to Walmart.

But after the Walmart incident I was >used up<, declining the daily walks and too busy working outside for her to ask me to take her on errands again.  And I have been very happy reading, cleaning, watching Joe Rogan, etc.  But what the heck is going to happen this winter when it is too icy and cold for her to walk?  I suspect she has >burned through< several of the other neighbors already.  

Thank you for reading this!!  It has helped me to write it out.  I don't feel vindictive at all,, but I feel used and I am tired of being used.  I feel pretty confident I will guilt myself into driving her around in the ice and snow.  She still owes me money, around $350, but I am just going to leave that be.  Your comments are welcome.  I hope  this may serve as a cautionary tale, if nothing else.

Kung ako lang, matagal na siguro akong wala.

Na-convert kami years ago kasi sina mama at papa (Catholic kami before). Sila muna nagpabinyag, then eventually napasama na rin kami. Sa simula, okay lang, parang welcoming yung community. 

Pero habang natuto ako ng mas maraming tungkol sa gospel nila, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants about kay Joseph Smith, yung golden plates, doon na nagsimula yung doubts. Like, confirmed na si Joseph Smith nag-practice talaga ng polygamy noon. Bawal din tea, coffee, even Coke. Plus, parang ‚Äúrequirement‚Äù na dapat consistent ka magbayad ng tithing kung gusto mong makapasok sa temple.

Hindi naman required magsimba weekly, pero andun yung pressure kasi bibisitahin ka ng members at missionaries, anong susuotin mo, anong bawal kainin, parang lahat may rule. 

Honestly, may pagka-cultish vibes. Naging bishop‚Äôs secretary pa ako dati so nakita ko rin yung galawan sa budget, pati chismis ng leaders. 

Yung mismong bishop namin dati, na-excommunicate dahil sa adultery with another member.

Kung hindi lang dahil diehard members parents ko at yung mga kaibigan ko na sobrang solid, wala na talaga ako. Sila na lang yung reason bakit kahit may doubts ako at halos wala nang faith sa system, nakatali pa rin ako sa simbahan.

Nagbibigay padin ako tithing konti.

Pero deep inside, alam kong hindi na ako naniniwala, nakakabit na lang ako kasi andun pa rin yung friendships na ayokong mawala.

# Murder of Roberto Calvi

Information from: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto\_Calvi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Calvi)

|Born|[13 April 1920                          Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan),¬†[Lombardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy),¬†[Kingdom of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy) |
|:-|:-|
|Died|[17 June 1982 (aged¬†62)                            London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London),¬†[England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) |
|Other¬†names|*Banchiere di Dio*¬†(""God's Banker"")|
|Occupation|Banker|

**Roberto Calvi**¬†(13 April 1920 ‚Äì 17 June 1982) was an¬†[Italian banker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_banker), dubbed ""God's Banker"" ([Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language):¬†*Banchiere di Dio*) by the press because of his close business dealings with the¬†[Holy See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See). He was a native of¬†[Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan)¬†and was chairman of¬†[Banco Ambrosiano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Ambrosiano), which collapsed in one of Italy's biggest political scandals.

Calvi's death by hanging in London in June 1982 is a source of enduring controversy and was ruled a murder after two¬†[coroners' inquests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner%27s_inquest)¬†and an independent investigation. Five people were acquitted in Rome in June 2007 of conspiracy to murder Roberto Calvi. Popular suspicion has linked his death to allegedly corrupt officials of the¬†[Vatican Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Bank), the¬†[Sicilian Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Mafia), and the¬†[Continental Freemasonry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Freemasonry)¬†lodge¬†[Propaganda Due](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_Due).

**Life and career**

Roberto Calvi's father was the manager of the¬†[Banca Commerciale Italiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banca_Commerciale_Italiana)¬†(Italian Commercial Bank). Calvi joined the bank after¬†[World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), but he moved to¬†[Banco Ambrosiano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Ambrosiano), then Italy's second-largest bank, in 1947. He married in 1952 and had two children. Soon he became the personal assistant of Carlo Alessandro Canesi, a leading figure and later president of Banco Ambrosiano.[^(\[1\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Calvi#cite_note-1)¬†Calvi was the bank's general manager in 1971 and chairman in 1975.

**Banco Ambrosiano scandal**

In 1978, the¬†[Bank of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Italy)¬†produced a report on¬†[Banco Ambrosiano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Ambrosiano)¬†which found that several billion¬†[lire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_lira)¬†had been exported illegally, leading to criminal investigations. Calvi was tried in 1981, given a four-year¬†[suspended sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_sentence), and fined US$19.8 million for transferring US$27 million out of the country in violation of Italian currency laws. He was released on¬†[bail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail)¬†pending appeal and kept his position at the bank. During his short spell in jail, Calvi attempted suicide. His family maintains that he was manipulated by others and was innocent of the crimes attributed to him.

The controversy surrounding Calvi's dealings at Banco Ambrosiano echoed a scandal in 1974 when the¬†[Holy See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See)¬†lost an estimated US$30 million upon the collapse of the¬†[Franklin National Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_National_Bank)¬†owned by financier¬†[Michele Sindona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Sindona). Bad loans and foreign currency transactions led to the collapse of the bank. Sindona died in prison after drinking coffee laced with¬†[cyanide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide).

Calvi wrote a letter of warning to¬†[Pope John Paul II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II)¬†on 5 June 1982, two weeks before the collapse of¬†[Banco Ambrosiano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Ambrosiano), stating that such an event would ""provoke a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions in which the Church will suffer the gravest damage.""¬†The correspondence confirmed that illegal transactions were common knowledge among the top affiliates of the bank and the Vatican. Banco Ambrosiano collapsed in June 1982 following the discovery of debts between US$700 million and 1.5 billion. Much of the money had been transferred through the¬†[Vatican Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Bank), which owned shares in Banco Ambrosiano.

In 1984, the¬†[Vatican Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Bank)¬†agreed to pay US$224 million to 120 of¬†[Banco Ambrosiano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Ambrosiano)'s¬†[creditors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor)¬†as a ""recognition of moral involvement"" in the bank's collapse.¬†It has never been confirmed whether the Vatican Bank was directly involved in the scandal due to a lack of evidence in the¬†[subpoenaed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena)¬†correspondence, which only revealed that Calvi consistently supported the Vatican's religious agenda. Calvi committed the crime of fiscal misconduct, and there was no evidence of church involvement otherwise, so the Vatican Bank was granted¬†[immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(law)).

**Death**

Calvi went missing from his¬†[Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome)¬†apartment on 10 June 1982, having fled the country on a false passport under the name Gian Roberto Calvini, fleeing initially to¬†[Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice). From there, he apparently hired a private plane to¬†[London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London)¬†via¬†[Z√ºrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich). A postal clerk was crossing London's¬†[Blackfriars Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfriars_Bridge)¬†at 7:30 am on Friday, 18 June and noticed Calvi's body hanging from the scaffolding beneath. Calvi had five bricks in his pockets and had in his possession about US$14,000 in three different currencies.

Calvi was a member of¬†[Licio Gelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licio_Gelli)'s illegal¬†[masonic lodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonic_lodge)¬†[Propaganda Due](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_Due)¬†(P2), who referred to themselves as¬†*frati neri*¬†or ""black friars."" This led to a suggestion in some quarters that Calvi was murdered as a masonic warning because of the symbolism associated with the word ""Blackfriars"".

The day before his body was found, Calvi was stripped of his post at¬†[Banco Ambrosiano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Ambrosiano)¬†by the¬†[Bank of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Italy), and his private secretary¬†[Graziella Corrocher](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Graziella_Corrocher&action=edit&redlink=1)¬†jumped to her death from a fifth-floor window at the bank's headquarters. Corrocher left behind an angry note condemning the damage that Calvi had done to the bank and its employees. Her death was ruled a suicide.

Calvi's death was the subject of two¬†[coroners' inquests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner%27s_inquest)¬†in London. The first recorded verdict of suicide was in July 1982. The Calvi family then secured the services of¬†[George Carman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carman),¬†[QC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Counsel). The second inquest was held in July 1983, and the jury recorded an¬†[open verdict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_verdict), indicating that the court had been unable to determine the exact cause of death. Calvi's family maintained that his death had been a murder.

In 1991, the Calvi family commissioned the¬†[New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)\-based investigation company¬†[Kroll Associates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroll_Inc.)¬†to investigate the circumstances of Calvi's death. The case was assigned to Jeff Katz, who was a senior case manager for the company in London. As part of his two-year investigation, Katz hired a former¬†[Home Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office)¬†forensic scientist,¬†[Angela Gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Gallop), to undertake forensic tests. She found that Calvi could not have hanged himself from the scaffolding because the lack of paint and rust on his shoes proved that he had not walked on the scaffolding. In October 1992, the forensic report was submitted to the¬†[home secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_secretary)¬†and the¬†[City of London Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London_Police), who dismissed it at the time.

Calvi's body was exhumed in December 1998, and an Italian court commissioned a German forensic scientist to repeat the work produced by Katz and his forensic team. That report was published in October 2002, ten years after the original, and confirmed the first report. In addition, it said that the injuries to Calvi's neck were inconsistent with hanging and that he had not touched the bricks found in his pockets. When his body was found, the¬†[River Thames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames)¬†had receded with the tide, but the scaffolding could have been reached by a person standing in a boat at the time of the hanging. That had also been the conclusion of a separate report by Katz in 1992, which also detailed a reconstruction based on Calvi's last known movements in London and theorized that he had been taken by boat from a point of access to the Thames in West London.

This aspect of Calvi's death was the focus of the theory that he was murdered and is the version of events depicted in Giuseppe Ferrara's film reconstruction of the event. In September 2003, the City of London Police re-opened their investigation as a murder inquiry.¬†More evidence arose, revealing that Calvi stayed in a flat in Chelsea Cloisters just prior to his death. Sergio Vaccari was a small-time drug dealer who had stayed in the same flat, and he was found dead in possession of masonic papers displaying member names of P2. The murders of both Calvi and Vaccari involved bricks stuffed in clothing, correlating the two deaths and confirming Calvi's ties to the lodge.

Calvi's life was insured for US$10 million with Unione Italiana. His family's attempts to obtain a payout resulted in litigation (*Fisher v Unione Italiana*¬†\[1998\] CLC 682). The forensic report of 2002 established that Calvi had been murdered and the policy was finally settled, although around half of the sum was paid to creditors of the Calvi family who incurred considerable costs during their attempts to establish the cause of his death.

**Prosecution of Giuseppe Cal√≤ and Licio Gelli**

In July 1991,¬†[Sicilian Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Mafia)¬†[*pentito*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentito)¬†[Francesco Marino Mannoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Marino_Mannoia)¬†claimed that Roberto Calvi became the victim of a¬†[contract killing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing)¬†because he had lost money belonging to senior Mafia bosses when¬†[Banco Ambrosiano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Ambrosiano)¬†collapsed.

According to Mannoia, the killer was¬†[Francesco Di Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Di_Carlo), a¬†*mafioso*¬†living in London at the time, on the orders of¬†[Giuseppe Cal√≤](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Cal%C3%B2)¬†and¬†[Propaganda Due](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_Due)¬†[Worshipful Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Master)¬†[Licio Gelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licio_Gelli). Di Carlo also became a cooperating witness in June 1996 and denied that he was the killer, but he admitted that Cal√≤ had approached him to commit the murder.

According to Di Carlo, the killers were Vaccari and¬†[Vincenzo Casillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Casillo), who belonged to the¬†[Camorra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camorra)¬†from¬†[Naples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples)¬†and both of whom were later murdered.¬†In 1997, Italian prosecutors in Rome implicated Cal√≤ in Calvi's murder, along with¬†[Flavio Carboni](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flavio_Carboni&action=edit&redlink=1), an allegedly mobbed up¬†[Sardinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia)¬†businessman with wide-ranging interests. Di Carlo and¬†[Ernesto Diotallevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ernesto_Diotallevi&action=edit&redlink=1), a member of the¬†[Banda della Magliana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banda_della_Magliana), were also alleged to be involved in the killing.¬†In July 2003, Italian prosecutors concluded that the Sicilian Mafia acted in its own interests and to ensure that Calvi could not blackmail them.

Gelli was the¬†[master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonic_lodge_officers#Worshipful_Master)¬†of the P2 lodge, and he received a notification on 19 July 2005 informing him that he was formally under investigation on charges of ordering Calvi's¬†[contract killing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing), along with Cal√≤, Diotallevi,¬†[Flavio Carboni](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flavio_Carboni&action=edit&redlink=1), and Carboni's Austrian girlfriend¬†[Manuela Kleinszig](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manuela_Kleinszig&action=edit&redlink=1). The other four suspects had been¬†[indicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment)¬†on murder charges in April. According to the indictment, the five ordered the murder to prevent Calvi ""from using blackmail power against his political and institutional sponsors from the world of Masonry, belonging to the P2 lodge, or to the Institute for Religious Works (the¬†[Vatican Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Bank)) with whom he had managed investments and financing with conspicuous sums of money, some of it coming from¬†[Cosa Nostra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosa_Nostra)¬†and public agencies"".

Gelli was accused of demanding Calvi's death as punishment for¬†[embezzling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement)¬†money from Banco Ambrosiano that belonged both to Gelli and to senior figures in the Mafia. The Mafia allegedly wanted to prevent Calvi from revealing that the Banco Ambrosiano had been used for¬†[money laundering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering). Gelli denied involvement but acknowledged that the financier was murdered. In his statement before the court, he said that the killing was commissioned in the¬†[People's Republic of Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland). This is thought to be a reference to Calvi's alleged involvement in financing the¬†[Solidarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union))¬†trade union movement at the request of Pope John Paul II, allegedly on behalf of the Vatican.¬†However, Gelli's name was not in the final indictment at the trial which started in October 2005.

**Trials in Italy**

In 2005, the Italian magistrates investigating Calvi's death took their inquiries to London in order to question witnesses. They had been cooperating with¬†[Chief Superintendent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Superintendent)¬†Trevor Smith who built his case partly on evidence provided by Katz. Smith had been able to make the first arrest of a UK witness who had allegedly committed¬†[perjury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury)¬†during the Calvi inquest.

On 5 October 2005, the trial began in Rome of the five individuals charged with Calvi's murder. The defendants were Cal√≤, Carboni, Kleinszig,¬†[Ernesto Diotallevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ernesto_Diotallevi&action=edit&redlink=1), and Calvi's former driver and bodyguard¬†[Silvano Vittor](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Silvano_Vittor&action=edit&redlink=1). The trial took place in a specially fortified courtroom in Rome's¬†[Rebibbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebibbia)¬†prison.¬†All five were cleared of murdering Calvi on 6 June 2007.¬†Judge Mario Lucio d'Andria threw out the charges, citing ""insufficient evidence"" after hearing 20 months of evidence. The court ruled that Calvi's death was murder and not suicide.¬†The defence suggested that there were plenty of people with a motive for Calvi's murder, including Vatican officials and Mafia figures who wanted to ensure his silence.¬†Legal experts following the trial said that the prosecutors found it hard to present a convincing case due to the 25 years that had elapsed since Calvi's death. Additionally, key witnesses were¬†[unwilling to testify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omert%C3%A0), untraceable, or dead.¬†The prosecution called for Manuela Kleinszig to be cleared, stating that there was insufficient evidence against her, but they sought¬†[life sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_sentence)¬†for the four men.

Katz claimed that it was likely that senior figures in the Italian establishment escaped prosecution. ""The problem is that the people who probably actually ordered the death of Calvi are not in the dock - but to get to those people might be very difficult indeed"".¬†Katz said that it was ""probably true"" that the Mafia carried out the killing, but that the gangsters suspected of the crime were either dead or missing.¬†The verdict in the trial was not the end of the matter, since the prosecutor's office in Rome had opened a second investigation by June 2007 implicating Gelli and others.

In May 2009, the prosecution dropped the case against Gelli. According to the magistrate, there was insufficient evidence to argue that Gelli had played a role in planning and executing the crime.¬†On 7 May 2010, the Court of Appeals confirmed the acquittal of Cal√≤, Carboni, and Diotallevi. Public prosecutor Luca Tescaroli commented that ""Calvi has been murdered for the second time.""¬†On 18 November 2011, the¬†[Court of Cassation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Cassation_(Italy))¬†confirmed the acquittal.¬†Cal√≤ is still serving a life sentence on unrelated Mafia charges.

**Films about Calvi's death**

BBC One's programme¬†[*Panorama*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panorama_(TV_programme))¬†chronicled Calvi's last days and uncovered new evidence which suggested that others had been involved in his death.¬†The 1983 PBS¬†[*Frontline*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontline_(American_TV_program))¬†documentary ""God's Banker"" investigated Calvi's links with the Vatican and P2, and questioned whether his death was really a suicide.¬†The circumstances surrounding his death were made into the feature film¬†[*I Banchieri di Dio - Il Caso Calvi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_banchieri_di_Dio)¬†(God's Bankers - The Calvi Case) in 2001.¬†A heavily fictionalized version of Calvi appears in¬†[*The Godfather Part III*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_III)¬†in the character of Frederick Keinszig.

In 1990,¬†[*The Comic Strip Presents*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Comic_Strip#The_Comic_Strip_Presents...)¬†produced a spoof version of Calvi's story under the title¬†*Spaghetti Hoops*, with¬†[Nigel Planer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Planer)¬†in the lead role, directed by¬†[Peter Richardson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Richardson_(British_director)), and co-written by him and¬†[Pete Richens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Richens).¬†[*Variety*¬†magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine))¬†described the comedy film¬†[*The Pope Must Die*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pope_Must_Die)¬†(1991) as ""loosely based on the Roberto Calvi banking scandal"".¬†In the 2009 film¬†[*The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imaginarium_of_Doctor_Parnassus)*,*¬†the character of Tony is found hanging alive under Blackfriars Bridge, which director¬†[Terry Gilliam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Gilliam)¬†described as ""an homage to Roberto Calvi"".

Calvi is featured in the Italian film¬†[*Il divo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_divo_(film))¬†(2008), a biography of former Italian Prime Minister¬†[Giulio Andreotti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Andreotti).",1,1756847837.0,ColdCaseVault,0,1.0,False

A friend told me that if I buy something like a $10 coffee with a debit card, it costs me exactly $10. If I use a credit card, though, I might pay later, but interest can make it $12 or $13 depending on the rate. Does that mean using a credit card is actually more wasteful than using a debit card for small purchases?

I like using my credit card when my bank balance is low because it keeps my account from going down immediately. It feels better emotionally, and I thought it might help me save toward bigger goals, like living on my own or long-term savings. But I‚Äôm starting to realize that the interest could outweigh the benefit of not seeing my balance drop. Keep in mind that I am currently working as part-time $14 per hour job at a department store where managers there tends to cut my hours every week. Which I can‚Äôt wait to hear back from my other better job soon.

I‚Äôm also wondering if my emotions are affecting my decision. When I see money leave my debit account, I feel it numerically and emotionally. Using a credit card keeps the balance the same for a while, but could that be making me spend more in the long run without realizing it?

Has anyone else tried using credit cards this way for emotional comfort while saving? Is it really smarter to just stick with a debit card, even if it feels worse at first?",1,1756847592.0,Adulting,18,1.0,False

1n6vskb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1n6vskb/aio_for_not_inviting_my_sisters_for_my_second/,AIO for not inviting my sisters for my second wedding party,"Little bit of context: Last month I got married to my amazing wife. We had our wedding in her country which is the other side of the world. Having said that, nobody of my family decided to come over, while her side said that if necessary they would be able to come over if we ever decided to do the ceremony in my country. It made me upset at first, but I soon realised that even if certain people in my family that are well off, I can‚Äôt force them if they don‚Äôt want to. The event went flawlessly and we did it the way we wanted it to go and I‚Äôm incredibly happy about that.

Alas, this past weekend my dad wanted to have a family outing with his kids (that being me and my four sisters) and take us to a local restaurant. Since I just returned at that point for less than a week after getting married, I was super excited to actually being able to talk about it with my siblings. Especially, since most of them I haven‚Äôt seen in person for months.

What was supposed to be a pretty neat Saturday night, turned into some of the most annoying, anger inducing evenings I have ever endured to date. 

About 20 minutes before we were supposed to gather at the restaurant, me and two of my sisters were already there, chatting. It was fine at first. Still, I noticed some tension of one sister being pushy, the other having recently been upset with her over medical documents. They had just made up, so things felt fragile. The sister who had been pressured then asked if I was going to have a bachelor party. I told her no, I‚Äôm already married and I don‚Äôt like parties like those anyway. Ironically, she started pressuring me into it. That annoyed me, since she had just gone through the same kind of pushiness from our other sister.

We went inside and waited for my dad and sister number three. The mood was okay; we talked about in-law troubles. Then sister number four arrived, loud and overly jovial. I don‚Äôt usually mind, but in a public setting, I‚Äôd rather focus on the people at the table instead of making a scene. She‚Äôs infectious when drinking, and soon another sister joined in. They began waving at people outside and clapping for strangers walking in. I just felt embarrassed.

Eventually, they turned the topic to my job. I said I work 32 hours since I‚Äôm still finishing my thesis. Hopefully, by February I‚Äôll move up to 36 or even full-time. But the sister who kept nagging me about the bachelor party brought it up again. I dismissed her, since I dislike repeating myself. After a bit of back-and-forth, I told her no means no, otherwise she‚Äôs no better than the sister she clashed with before. That finally shut it down.

Meanwhile, my oldest sister started playing Memory with beer cartons, yelling for almost 45 minutes. Then, during drinks, the same sister who pushed the party idea toasted ‚Äúto everyone working, and to the one working the least,‚Äù clearly aimed at me. I told her flat out that my hours are none of her business.

Somehow, the talk shifted to the celebration I‚Äôm planning with my wife when she comes over in November or December. I said we‚Äôd do it on a Saturday between 1 and 5 PM Immediately, my sisters caused an uproar, telling me I couldn‚Äôt plan it that way. I reminded them it‚Äôs our party, not theirs. If they want to get drunk, they can do it after. Still, I had to spend another 10 minutes justifying myself. And honestly, I don‚Äôt see why, since it‚Äôs my party, not theirs.

And it only got worse from there. I was enjoying my Irish coffee, and after finishing it, my sisters thought it was funny to grab my empty glass, tip it sideways, knock it over, and turn it upside down. I just sat there thinking, why is this necessary? Is it to annoy me? To make me angry? Maybe they just enjoy seeing me upset. After I asked the waiter to take my glass, they shifted to my paper plate, crumpling it, nudging me. Multiple sisters joined in.

Here‚Äôs the thing, I can take verbal abuse because I can defend myself. But once you start touching me, everything changes. My body language completely shifts, I get disinterested, and I don‚Äôt want to be there anymore. When they stuffed my paper napkin down my shirt, I wanted to stand up, throw money on the table, and leave. I had cancelled other commitments that night, and I immediately regretted it.

Before our food came, one sister got a call from her husband, bragging that he won money gambling. My second eldest sister laughed and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the Philippines to celebrate your wedding.‚Äù I just looked at her and said, first of all, my wedding is already over, and second, history shows you lot wouldn‚Äôt even come. At that point, the sister who kept nagging me about a bachelor party jumped in. She had once promised to come to the wedding but broke her wrist and, even then, hadn‚Äôt filed her vacation days properly. So it wasn‚Äôt going to happen anyway. I looked at her and said, ‚ÄúSo what are you going to do this time, break your other wrist?‚Äù Then I just stared ahead, done with it all.

They could see I was upset, but none of them owned up or said sorry. Instead, they doubled down. When the food finally came, one sister remarked, ‚ÄúSee, we can actually be quiet for once.‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúCows are quiet when they eat too.‚Äù After dinner, they weren‚Äôt done yet. They kept saying how bad of an idea it was to host the wedding party in the afternoon. I told them the only reason they wanted an evening party was so they could leave their kids with their spouses and drink excessively, which isn‚Äôt going to happen. Especially after tonight, there would be a no-alcohol policy anyway.

Eventually, one of them joked, ‚ÄúCareful, if we keep this up, maybe he won‚Äôt even invite us.‚Äù I told them straight: ‚ÄúWith the way you‚Äôre behaving tonight, I might actually consider that.‚Äù My eldest sister then offered to take photographs at the wedding, and the others mocked her, saying she only wanted a role to make herself important. I told them not to bother, since I already had people for that.

I sat through the rest of the night in silence. At 10:15PM, my eldest sister left. I looked at the time, stood up, and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to thank you for the evening. Goodbye.‚Äù And I left.

Since then, only one sister has reached out and that was more than 24 hours later. I haven‚Äôt felt the need to answer. This past Saturday was the first time I went to bed angry/humiliated and woke up angry. It‚Äôs a sickening feeling, and I don‚Äôt ever want that again. It affects me and the people around me. I was still so upset that when I came home, I couldn‚Äôt even talk to my wife right away. She lives on the other side of the world, but I decided then and there that their presence at my wedding celebration in my country isn‚Äôt needed. I don‚Äôt need their negativity. Especially if it‚Äôs at the same restaurant, then that place will just remind me of that awful night.

So that‚Äôs what went down. Am I right? Am I wrong? I don‚Äôt know. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter. All I know is this is how I feel, and I needed to let it out. Thanks for taking the time reading this.",1,1756847575.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

It took longer than the reverse, but it was acceptable and I always enjoyed the slightly longer, late-night journey.  After the covid lockdowns, the last train became something like 10:45 PM, which isn't really ideal if you see a show in the West End and it finishes around 10:30 PM ; you probably wouldn't get back to Paddington in time for the last train.  Even more annoyingly, there is a train that leaves Paddington at 11:45 PM, but it only goes as far as Bristol Temple Meads and there's something like a four hour transfer time for the next train! I just can't imagine waiting on train platform for that length of time, especially at that early hour of the morning, when there's no bars or coffee shops open... not to mention, any kind of potential bad weather or even winos/druggies hanging around during those hours.  I did catch the bus from London Victoria last week, but weirdly, the last three times I've caught the National Express to Cardiff, I've come back with a throat infection!  Sure, it's cheaper than a train fare, but putting myself through that kind of ordeal doesn't seem worth it.  I guess it's a hotel room for the night from now on (more potential cost).

The ENT I went to told me it was glossitis and to stop drinking coffee. It stayed pretty mild and I was able to manage it with a low sugar diet and cleaning my tongue two or three times a day. But in early June of this year, I ate a chocolate bar and the thrush fully flared. It was on my inner cheeks, the corners of my mouth were cracking, and it had spread to my throat and esophagus overnight.

At first, I tried and failed with the candida diet and ended up in urgent care and being prescribed nystatin and fluconazole. They helped, but then it came back almost immediately. I‚Äôve been on a Candida diet again (mostly successfully!) for a little over 30 days now. My diet consists of eggs, spinach, chicken, salmon, tuna, steak, ground beef, bell peppers, asparagus, lots of garlic, onions, fresh oregano, extra virgin olive oil.

I occasionally do peroxide and water rinses and brush my tongue with a little bit of baking soda as needed. And plenty of cleaning my tongue with a soft bristle brush with no product because everything seems to cling to my tongue. 

About a week ago, I ate a handful of grape tomatoes on a salad (spinach, EVOO, ACV, chicken) and the tomatoes gave me a pretty bad flareup and now I‚Äôm going through the die off phase again. I was really surprised that it was a tiny bit of tomato that did it.

Anyway, I was just hoping people could recommend a product or two. I‚Äôve read a lot of threads on here and I see so many different things being recommended to people and I don‚Äôt know where to start. I feel like I have the basics covered but I also think I could/should be doing more. 

I also get plenty of sunlight and a bit of exercise daily (walking & biking, but I‚Äôm limited because of my spine)

1n6vp8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/eBayStars/comments/1n6vp8h/what_sells_best_on_ebay_right_now/,What sells best on eBay right now?,"What sells best on eBay?  That is a tricky question and the answer changes as trends change.  Furthermore, hot selling items are closely guarded by eBay sellers.  If they spill the beans, they simply create their own competition.

I have been selling full time on eBay for five years.  Here are a few categories that have been hot for me in the past few months:

* **Collectibles/Nostalgia** ‚Äì Anything that taps into millennial/Gen Z nostalgia is gold. I sold an old iPod Classic for $160 last week. Game Boy Advance SPs are hitting $120+ if they‚Äôre in decent shape. And Labubu dolls (the Pop Mart figures) are going crazy ‚Äî some variants hit $300+. Vintage stereoview cards and old postcards are still steady sellers too if you can source them cheap.
* **Sneakers/Streetwear** ‚Äì Nike Dunks and Jordans are always solid. I had a pair of beat-up Jordan 4s I picked up at a thrift for $20 ‚Äî sold them for $140 in two days. Patagonia Synchilla pullovers and Carhartt chore coats are moving well too.
* **Weird Replacement Stuff** ‚Äì This one surprised me. A random Samsung TV remote I listed for $12 sold the same day. Same with old appliance parts (think blender lids, coffee machine carafes, vacuum filters). Low-dollar, but the margins are stupid good because I usually pay $1 or less.
* **Electronics** ‚Äì Used consoles are hot again. PS2s and Wii consoles are still selling like crazy, especially bundles with games. Even an old Canon AE-1 film camera I found in a box lot went for $200.
* **Toys** ‚Äì LEGO is evergreen, especially sealed sets. I sold a sealed Harry Potter set from 2010 for $280. Hot Wheels Redlines, older Barbies, and even Beyblades are moving well.

What I‚Äôve noticed: the sweet spot is small, shippable stuff with nostalgia factor or something hard to find on Amazon. The random/quirky items are where eBay really shines compared to other marketplaces.

If you‚Äôre new, check ‚Äúsold listings‚Äù on eBay before buying inventory andthat‚Äôll show you what‚Äôs actually selling, not just what people want to get.  Good luck!",1,1756847364.0,eBayStars,0,1.0,False

1n6vn9p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6vn9p,I'm all out of titles and so lost without you,"I ate the breakfast really late so I didn't really eat dinner but I did eat the nuts and cookies for a late afternoon snack and the rest for breakfast this morning. 

The cookies are a tasty vanilla shortbread cookie and are crisp and crumbly at the same time. The vanilla is very pronounced but not over whelming and the sweetness level was just right. 9/10 and I really should've had tea with them. The nuts are truth in advertising in every way imaginable. It was peanuts, cashews and almonds and nothing else. Literally raw nuts. No roasting, no salt or other seasoning. Definitely could've used something. Most nuts I've had in rations have been raw or like a candied nut. Maybe it's something to cut down on spoilage??? They were great with a handful and a cookie but on their own...3/10. A real shame too because nuts are a very nutritious snack. Even just dry roasting with no seasoning would've been a 6 or so. 

Onward and upward? Breakfast consisted of the cherry drink, hot chocolate with coffee, rajma masala and chicken casserole. I again heated them up in boiling water for about 15 minutes. They both look like slop but what doesn't coming out of a retort pouch. I ate the casserole first and it had the pasta, finely shredded chicken, lentils and huge carrot pieces. This is definitely a casserole. I could see putting it in a baking dish with a bread crumb/parm/gremolata topping thing. The texture was almost mush. The pasta was so soft along with the carrots and with the finely shredded chicken it was literally almost mush. That might be by design. You could house this in a few minutes if needed because it was so soft. Add a little water to loosen and you could almost drink it. Flavor wise it had a very Italian American flavor profile. My Italian ancestors would throw the evil eye at you if you fed this to them. Not my favorite main in this one but it decent enough. I ate all of it. 7.5/10 for me. Fix the texture and it goes higher. 

The rajma is a red kidney bean based dish. I love beans. They great and I love all the Indian dishes they appear in and this is no different. It has a thick, rich sauce (almost too thick, maybe needed a tablespoon of water) and loads of beans. A really filling meal. The texture greatly benefitted from the beans being just cooked through. The salt level was just right and you could really taste the sour bite from the mango powder. The spice level is objective and for me it could've used just a bit more but it was a deal breaker. This was a 9/10 for me. 

I had the cherry drink and a cafe mocha with the hot chocolate and coffee. The cherry had a pleasant sour note and it reminded me about of a good cherry pie filling. A nice sour bite that balances the sweetness. I would not turn it down. 8/10 for me. I tried the hot chocolate on it's own and it had a strong chocolate flavor. Not as decadent as the French one but adding the creamer helped fix it. Adding coffee to any hot chocolate makes it world's better. It can take it from meh to magnificent. 8/19 for me on this one. Pair it with the sweet parts. I split the hot chocolate so half for breakfast and half for snack time. The snack was the chocolate cakes. As you can see it's mini cakes in chocolate sauce. They heat up just fine in boiling water and yes you should heat them up. Are they as good as a freshly baked chocolate cake...hell no. Are they good for a retort pouch...hell yeah. The texture is dense and the sauce is like Hershey's chocolate sauce but it's tasty. Especially after a super savory meal it's a welcome palette change. I'm giving them an 8/10. 

I'm a big, white dude that was raised in deep, dirty south and lives in the Northern south or at least they think they're Southern. Luckily I grew up near New Orleans so the food was amazing. Red beans and rice on Mondays, seafood we caught on Fridays, spaghetti and meatballs for Sunday lunch at Granny's and an occasional muffuletta thrown in for good measure. Not to mention all the gumbo I ate growing up at every holiday and the jambalaya we made for something different outside of Lent. Which brings me to my point...maybe. I love cooking and eating good food and when I went to college I was exposed to foreign food that wasn't Chinese takeout or Mexican. One of the cuisines I've grown to love is Indian. All the singular spices that come together to make extraordinary dishes and all the vegetarian options. I know the UK has a tradition of excellent Indian food and I hope this extends to the other Indian mains in other ORPs. I'll stop rambling now and get to the reason why everyone is here. 

Overall this menu 1 ORP is an 8/10. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to the others I have and will have. Tariffs be damned!!!!!! ",4,1756847229.0,MRE,6,1.0,False

Vanilla Melts- This one‚Äôs my fav vanilla so far. It does need some maceration and I suggest you keep it in the fridge for 24 hours. The performance is beautiful. Opens sweet, settles musky.

On the way home, I asked her if it would be okay for me to intervene if her dad ever got physical with her.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Title: ""Braves vs. Cubs: A Tale of Two Tired Teams and a Home Run That Could‚Äôve Been a Meteor""**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‚Äòround for a matchup that‚Äôs about as exciting as a tax audit but with more hot dogs! The Atlanta Braves (62-75) and Chicago Cubs (78-59) are set to clash in a game that‚Äôs less ‚ÄúWorld Series preview‚Äù and more ‚Äúwho can trip over their own feet less often?‚Äù Let‚Äôs break down the numbers, news, and why this game might be best watched through a sleep mask.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Statistical Masterpiece (Or Disaster?)

First, the Braves are under .500, which is baseball speak for ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not winning a title, pal.‚Äù They‚Äôve lost three of their last four games, including a 19-4 loss to the Phillies that probably left their dugout still reeling. Their starter, Spencer Strider, is 5-12 with a 4.95 ERA‚Äînumbers that scream, ‚ÄúI need a therapist, not a contract extension.‚Äù Meanwhile, the Cubs‚Äô Colin Rea is 10-6 with a 4.23 ERA, which sounds impressive until you realize he‚Äôs allowed **20 home runs in 132 innings**. That‚Äôs one HR every 6.6 innings. If he‚Äôs pitching in a cornfield, people might start betting on whether the ball will hit a scarecrow.

Both teams are also stuck in a low-scoring funk. Atlanta has seen 5 of its last 6 games go under the total in September, while Chicago has 6 of 7 under the total against Atlanta. If this game were a movie, it‚Äôd be titled *The Quiet Ones*.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Habits, and the Eternal Struggle of Mondays

The Braves? They‚Äôre dealing with the kind of losing streak that makes you question if their ‚Äúteam motto‚Äù is just ‚Äúshow up and hope for rain.‚Äù Their recent 19-4 loss to Philly wasn‚Äôt just a defeat‚Äîit was a culinary disaster. The Cubs, meanwhile, are 2-6 on Mondays this season, which is statistically worse than flipping a coin‚Ä¶ if a coin had a 25% success rate.

As for the pitchers? Strider‚Äôs ERA is so high, it‚Äôs practically a ZIP code for ‚ÄúI give up runs.‚Äù Rea‚Äôs 20 HRs allowed? That‚Äôs enough to stock a small ballpark‚Äôs souvenir shop. And let‚Äôs not forget the Cubs‚Äô recent 5-6 loss to Colorado‚Äîa game soÊÉ®, even the Rockies‚Äô altitude probably yawned through it.

---

### Humorous Spin: Why This Game Is a Sleeper Hit (For the Nap Industry)

The Braves‚Äô offense is like a dial-up internet connection: you *think* something‚Äôs happening, but no, it‚Äôs just 2003. Their 3-1 win over Philly last week? A miracle, really. Drake Boldwin‚Äôs game-winning home run was so unexpected, it probably surprised the bat in the ball.

The Cubs? They‚Äôre the definition of ‚Äúconsistent inconsistency.‚Äù With Rea on the mound, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd score runs‚Ä¶ but no. His ERA says it all: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not bad, but I‚Äôm not the guy you want when your grandma‚Äôs in the stands with a bun in the oven.‚Äù

And let‚Äôs talk about the total under 8 runs. If this game hits that mark, it‚Äôll be the first time both teams have agreed on something since the 2016 Cubs‚Äô World Series win.

---

### Prediction: Under the Covers (Literally)

Putting it all together, this game is a snoozefest with a slight edge to the Braves. Why? Because even a broken clock is right twice a day, and the Braves‚Äô ‚Äúright‚Äù days are‚Ä¶ well, they haven‚Äôt had many. But with both teams leaning into their underdog personas and the total likely to stay under 8 runs, bet on a 4-3 Atlanta victory.

Final score: **Braves 4, Cubs 3**. Total runs: 7. Crowd reaction: A mix of confusion and ‚Äúis it over yet?‚Äù

In conclusion, if you‚Äôre looking for a game that‚Äôll test your patience and your coffee‚Äôs staying power, this is it. Grab a blanket, pretend you‚Äôre asleep, and hope for a home run that might as well be launched by a trebuchet.

*Now go tell your friends you‚Äôre a baseball expert. They‚Äôll believe you‚Ä¶ because everyone loves a good nap.* üèüÔ∏èüí§

Hey, everyone. I'm a 24 year old(M). Recently I've joined a masters programme. I came across a girl who casually called me 'cute' in our first few days and once she complimented my crocs. We started greeting each other from far away. My friends told me that she's giving me hints, so I thought of her talking to her. But she took a leave for a week then.

She came back yesterday. So I came across her, and said 'Hi' she replied with 'I find you really cute'. I got flustered and complemented her outfit. In response to this she said, ""I like your long pause Everything"" And went away slightly flustered. Her friend was laughing and few people teased me over it as well. 10 min later, we were on a break so me and my friend group went to get coffee, she was buying something as well so I tried to hide away. So I stood outside the shop with 6-7 friends. She came out of the shop and looked at me, and gave me a huge grin. Exactly like this emoji, I got so flustered, this keeps playing in my head. I DMed her today, but the convo was very awkward. We just talked about what she was watching and she asked to recommend something. At the end I did thank her for the compliments today and called her pretty as well.

Then we said bye and gn. The convo was okayish.I felt that both of us dont know how to talk via text.

Don't worry, it won't be brandishing sirens anytime soon, but it might save a dispatcher from a minor nervous breakdown. With over a million calls bombarding them a year, and more than half of those not even involving emergencies, the county decided it was time for some AI intervention. From towed cars to calling about a police report from last Friday, they've got it covered.

**AI Triage: The Call Center Superhero?**

In a recent test run where the AI was put into action for a mere two hours, it handled close to 150 calls. That's not too shabby for a newbie trying on its futuristic cape. According to Dru Clarke, the assistant director of operations at the 911 center, this AI superhero ensures that emergency lines remain open for, well, emergencies.

But don‚Äôt worry, the AI isn‚Äôt trying to steal jobs or salary checks. It knows when it has hit the glass ceiling and routes calls to a live person if things get too hot in its digital kitchen.

**Phase One: Talking Towed Cars and Reports**

During the first trial phase, the AI handled calls that didn‚Äôt need dispatch. Think reports from regular folks stuck on hold for stealing glances at their coffee-drenched phones, waiting in frustration. Now, they might be getting help, or at least a resolution, without that wait. 

**Phase Two: A Public Safety Revolution**

Coming soon in phase two, the AI will get more dispatch duties. No, it's not pulling out a badge but will deal with things like graffiti cases and fallen trees instead of real crises. Imagine chatting AI-style about why Wisteria Lane decided to overgrow into your digital nightmares. 

**A World Without 911 Hold Music**

If the AI‚Äôs taking care of business, the 911 lines remain free and securely open round the clock, maintaining the safety and sanity of Fairfax County‚Äôs residents. What‚Äôs more, this AI majesty also speaks multiple languages‚Äîexpanding its charm across cultural barriers‚Äîwhich is more than I can say about my high school French.

With AISalsa'ing through 911 calls, are we on the brink of a digital customer service revolution, or a sequel to the Terminator where Skynet is passive-aggressively polite? Let's discuss: ü§î How comfortable are you with AI handling your nonemergency calls? Would you trust it, or does this all sound like the start of an AI reality show mashup you'd rather skip?

Maybe it's current news to us but man were the references so dated. LP has been old news since Mark Z wore it years ago prepandemic. Succession's been here awhile too üòÖ probably a slow news editorial to tie to all the ""nouveau"" corruption we've been trying to expose without naming things. Also that black AMEX card has been around not just since the start of Succession (2018?) but I think the getting coffee episode with Seinfield on Netflix IIRC where he claims to have been the first guy offered this invite only card. Even jets flying in celebs and millionaires have been a known mainstream issue since Joaquin Phoenix mentioned it in his Oscar speech years ago. Man, this article was a bit disappointing. There are other ways to have connected the loud wealth vs our stealth wealth.

Heck they could have compared stealth wealth by Robina and other PH billionaires to really drive the tone home. We need better editorials now more than ever. Especially because we're talking about misuse of government fund allocations for flooding. What an out of touch article.

So, disclaimer before I start:  
**I don‚Äôt know this community‚Äôs lore** theory‚Äôs **that well so it‚Äôs quite possible what I‚Äôm saying already exists. Similarly, some stuff I say might be factually incorrect. Feel free to correct me on it.** 

My theory assumes a lot of stuff that isn‚Äôt ever said in the game and is pretty out there so bear with me. Also, it contradicts Undertale Yellow, but eh who care about that.  
Disclaimers aside, let‚Äôs start from the very beginning‚Ä¶

Chara falls underground ‚úÖ  
Chara dies ‚úÖ  
Asriel also dies while trying to bring Chara to surface ‚úÖ  
Flowey now exists, thanks to a certain Alphys ‚úÖ

Well, now we have the underground looking like this (at least in my head):  
Toriel has gone to the ruins, after Asgore declares war,  leaving one Asgore to deal with a bunch of monsters. As we already know, Asgore is not the best goat to be ruling. (that being said, I don‚Äôt care how many beers he‚Äùs drunk or how many deer he ran over, he‚Äôs still the best character in the game)

Asgore now faces a lot of guilt for one measly mistake that caused his wife to leave him forever, and he builds a new house that‚Äôs identical to the old one to replicate his former days‚Ä¶

But you guys know all this already. Let‚Äôs fast forward to‚Ä¶

THE SOULS:  
(The order in which I headcannon them falling in is- Patience, Kindness, Bravery AND Integrity (at the same time), Perseverance and Justice)

\-So my headcannon is based off of this imaginary facet: Your soul embodies your most powerful trait. When you die (how to die permanently in the underground? I‚Äôll get there in a sec) your soul lasts for a bit of time (longer than boss monsters, but not more than a few minutes) before fading away completely. However, while your soul is not in your body (and you‚Äôre dead), it emits powerful energy.  
**When a monster absorbs this energy, they gain the power to change the colors of OTHER SOULS.**

\-Now, patience has fallen into the underground. They don‚Äôt meet Flowey, and go directly to ruins, where they stay with Toriel for a lot of time before sneaking out. Sans and Papyrus aren‚Äôt in Snowdin yet. She (yes patience is a she) goes straight through Snowden. However, in waterfall, a travesty occurs, and she dies after drowning in the water.  
Now, how can someone die? Don‚Äôt they just respawn? However, the problem is that you require determination. Even then, I think these souls had a decent amount of determinatio, but only enough to fuel one save point. Think of this like a Respawn Anchor in Minecraft which has only one charge left: you revive in a specific point once, after which if you die, you‚Äôre dead.  
Patience, however, set her spawnpin the junkyard area of the waterfall. After she drowned, she got revived only to be immediately suffocated inside a dirty soda can (this is important)

An intern Alphys is just walking around despodently. At this time, Alphys is a younger person (so is everyone else) and is not yet the royal scientist: she is W. D. Gaster‚Äôs assistant (yes I know that‚Äôs a bombshell but I well explain this too). As she scavenges in the trash, looking for a god anime novel, she discovers a glowing soda can‚Ä¶ and sees a soul in it.

She brings back the soul to the True Lab and along with Gaster engineers a working container for the soul to be stored in. She was not affected by the Patience‚Äôs energy release upon death because she can later. The soul didn‚Äôt fade away due to it being lodged inside a soda can.

\-Next up, we have Kindness. Now, at this time, our favorite Gerson is still the Hammer of Justice, and he has a teenage Undyne (Does that mean Alphys is older than Undyne? yes, but not by a huge margin) following him around everywhere. Gerson is part of the Royal Guard and is on the lookout for humans. When Kindness falls, she stays with Toriel only out of ~~politeness~~ Kindess for a day before leaving, determined to get out of the Underground. Unfortunately, she comes face to face with Gerson mwho kills her. (Whew this is quite morbid so far). However, Undyne is nearby, as she was coming to say hi to Gerson and receive some training from him.

As she dies, her soul radiates a lot of energy, which is absorbed by Undyne and Gerson. Now, as mentioned before, both Undyne and Gerson can now change a soul to green color. Before Undyne can see the body, Gerson hides it, and Undyne never knows that she‚Äôs gained a new ability... until she meets another human of course.

Gerson takes the soul (in a box of spaghetti) to Gaster, who uses the container to wrap it up. 

\-Now comes my favorite personal part: Braveness and Integrity... At the same time?  
So braveness and integrity are brothers, and they fall into the underground (You can probably see where this is going) They don‚Äôt bother staying with Toriel at all, but Braveness does run into Flowey, and is saved by goatmon. Once they reach Snowden, they meet a certain Gaster.   
Gaster attacks both of them towards the end if Snowdin, killing braveness and integrity using the newly patented ‚ÄúGaster Blasters‚Äù. Gaster, filled with an unknown dread and guilt, hesitates for almost a minute before he takes the 2 souls, leaving the skeletons behind.

That one minute has infused the skeletons with enough determination to revive themselves‚Ä¶ into Sans and Papyrus. The skeletons wake up with no memory except that the other skeleton is their brother. From then on, the only person who knows the truth about the, is Gaster.

Gaster, now receiving considerably amounts of energy from the souls (not a particularly good thing) hitches a ride with boatman to Hotland and into the True Lab, where, under a heavy fire of questions from Alphys, stores the souls, not bothering to answer any of them.

From here on, Gaster, gets steadily more reclusive, haunted by guilt‚Ä¶

\-Perseverance‚Ä¶ well you can imagine how this is going to play out. Bam through ruins, snowdin, even Hotland. At this point, Mettaton is currently under development. Perseverance has also managed to sneak under the radar of some skeletons and a fish. However, not funding a hot limo for spiders becomes her undoing as Muffet kills her. Muffet leaves the soul ensnared in the web, where a bunch of smaller spiders gift wrap it and deliver it to a perplexed Alphys. At this point, Gaster is basically hiding in a hole while Alphys conducts more determination experiments along with her new partner, Sans the Skeleton

\-Now time for our boy Clove-I mean Justice. This one is probably the most interesting of the lot. Justice comes to the underground on purpose to try and find the missing souls. He blazes (like most of the souls) past Toriel. As he goes past Snowdin, he reaches the lab, only to be confronted by Sans and Alphys.

Justice puts up the best fight of all souls till now, shooting Sans in the eyeball socket. However, Alphys brings out her newest creation: a combat oriented robot with a ghost, Mettaton. Justice serverly damages his combat features but succumbs in the end. Sans is gone by now to try and heal his eye, while Justice‚Äôs soul releases energy that is absorbed by Mettaton.

And now we‚Äôre in present day.  
(Sans‚Äô eye glows yellow because of the one bullet that hit him)

I‚Äôll update this with better grammar/facts and remove some inconsistencies later.

It has been the hardest four months of my life learning how to live without him not having him there when I need him not being able to call him just to tell him something that happened to my day, I can‚Äôt ask him how the day is, I No longer see his name coming up on my phone 
when he decided to break up with me I made a big mistake cause an argument that I shouldn‚Äôt have and I know my mistakes and I know I‚Äôm not perfect. But I never should have caused this problem for him. 
I am beating myself up, but it was clearly one straw Too many and he left and never came back. We have a two-year-old together so he has to contact me to see him other then that it‚Äôs nothing I don‚Äôt see him or hear from him (but I can‚Äôt blame him) 
I have tried everything to get him to come home, I apologize continuously (I know what I did and I try to take accountability for it) started going to therapy. I started taking new medication. I started rereading all the taxes to figure out what I did and I played in my mind how I should‚Äôve done  better for him and treated him better . I‚Äôve asked him to come over and hang out or just talk or go for coffee or watch a movie even I told him I just make him food and drop it off or to go for icecream with me and the kids and he won‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt blame him though. I just really miss him and this is the hardest thing that‚Äôs happened in my life. He was the one I was supposed to marry and that just blew up in flames. My feelings don‚Äôt matter in this though I have learned as I hurt him incredibly bad and he wants me to stay away from him‚Ä¶ (should I just stop reaching out,asking to do stuff, bothering him) I can‚Äôt keep reaching out to him because it‚Äôs either bothering him because he doesn‚Äôt answer me for hours on the end or he‚Äôll leave me on read for 14 hours at a time so clearly he‚Äôs not interested and I‚Äôm just looking more pathetic by asking him to come over

1n6v1f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1n6v1f5/tired_of_losing_track_of_your_job_applications_i/,Tired of losing track of your job applications? I built a solution.,"Job searching is brutal right now, especially in tech market. Most people need to submit 500+ applications to land a job, and keeping track of them all is a nightmare. I used to rely on google sheets and Trello boards, but they created more problems than they solved:



The pain points I experienced:

\- Clicking tiny cells to enter data is tedious and might cause mistakes

\- Missing interview time or assignment deadline often

\- Generic process doesn't fit to all applications

\- Impossible to take detailed notes for each stage of the process

\- No way to prioritize which applications deserve more attention

Try the app here:¬†[https://www.job-flow.app/](https://www.job-flow.app/)



My solution: I built a job application tracker designed specifically for modern job seekers.

These are the Key features:

‚úÖ Lightning-fast status updates - Update your application stage with one click

‚úÖ Never miss deadlines - Built-in date track

‚úÖ Fully customizable - Customize each application process to your specific needs

‚úÖ Stage-by-stage notes - Document your entire journey for each application

‚úÖ Smart prioritization - Star important applications to stay focused

While this app is optimized for tech roles, it works for anyone who wants to organize their job search effectively.

About me: I'm a solo developer who built this from scratch - from brainstorming the concept to designing the UI to coding every feature. I created this because I lived through the same frustrations you're experiencing.

It's completely free - I'm covering all hosting costs because I believe good tools shouldn't be another barrier to finding work.

Want to help make it better? There's an easy feedback section in the app for suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests. I'm also looking forward to collaborate with engineers if you're interested in contributing or making this product bigger.

Yet, it's officially stated that Ran Tan Waltz has a **pedal harp** and an acoustic steel guitar on the song...for the life of me I can't hear them, can you?

**'Coffee Homeground'** \- (bright) piano, bass guitar, drums, brass instruments, strings, cowbell on the word 'making' (poison)...and on the word ‚Äòdiet‚Äô (know your game)...violin, triangle, piccolo, flute, tuba(?) muted horns, oboe, trombone and plucked strings (harp?) during the repetition at the end.

Again, this song is supposed to have a **synthesiser** in it?! Where is it? Are these sampled synthesiser instruments being used then? I've scoured the internet to get answers to these questions.

The Friday of the send-off at Andy‚Äôs bar, The Fore and Aft, arrived quickly. Audrey had stopped by a couple of times during the week, thankfully keeping to her side of the counter.

She seemed genuinely excited about all of us going out together‚Äîher and me, Helen and Steve. We‚Äôd probably make for two really dynamic couples, if we weren‚Äôt so utterly dysfunctional.

Helen was engaged, Steve had Angela, Audrey was seeing her ‚Äúteenager,‚Äù as I called him, Jeffrey, and I was deeply in love with Mary but still couldn‚Äôt say no to Audrey. A real dumpster fire, I thought, smirking.

I pulled into the lot across the street and parked. The plan was for Audrey, Helen, and me to drive up to Andy‚Äôs bar, while Steve would head straight there after work.

The more I thought about it, though, the less I could believe I was actually going through with this. Especially after they cut out on me that night at the Underground. Some people never learn‚ÄîI guess I was one of them.

But this night meant a lot to Andy, and Andy meant a lot to me. He was a true friend, always had my back. So I told myself I was doing it for him.

Then there was Mary. We were in love, moving in together, starting a whole new life‚Äîand here I was basically lying to her about tonight. No way she‚Äôd be on board with it.

Still, I could hear Andy‚Äôs voice in my head: Just live in the moment and get it over with. It wasn‚Äôt like this was some solo date with Audrey. It was a group thing, and if it didn‚Äôt happen now, it never would.

At work, it was just a typical Friday. I ran my jobs, took my breaks and lunch, and when four-thirty rolled around, I met Audrey and Helen in the lobby. They were cheerful, and with the work portion of the day behind me, I relaxed and resigned myself to enjoying the evening.

I got directions from Andy. We took I-287 and made it to the bar in an hour and a half‚Äînot bad considering weekend traffic.

Steve was waiting at the bar when we arrived. It was only a twenty-minute drive from 440 Hamilton, where he worked.
I gave him a big hug, congratulating him on passing the test on Monday and telling him how great it was to be working together again.

Andy said he‚Äôd get there around seven o‚Äôclock, and we could order food at the bar. We got the usual bar fare‚Äîwings, potato skins, and mozzarella sticks‚Äîwashing them down with mugs of cold draft beer.

We were all together, but it was clear that Steve was paired up with Helen, and I was with Audrey.

For some reason, Audrey started telling me about an ex-boyfriend from high school, a Black kid her family disapproved of, and how it became too much trouble, so they broke up.

I wanted to talk about Mary and our plans to move into Angie‚Äôs apartment, but something kept stopping me. I guess, subconsciously or not, I wanted the night to still be about us.

At this point, we weren‚Äôt really a group anymore‚ÄîSteve was all into Helen, and I was with Audrey. I wanted to rest my hand on her leg but thought better of it, half because of Mary and half because I thought Audrey might push it away.

It was a relief when Andy walked in and came over. He wasn‚Äôt much of a hugger, so he shook our hands, and the girls kissed his cheek.

Steve looked a bit disappointed, like Andy‚Äôs arrival had broken his momentum. I was just glad to see Andy. He had about thirty minutes before he was on duty, so he was toasting shots with us and guzzling draft beer until then‚Äînot that it really mattered.

‚ÄúTo Gerry and his girlfriend moving in together,‚Äù Andy toasted. I loved the guy, but he really had a big mouth.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre moving in with her?‚Äù Audrey barked. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even know her two months. What is wrong with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes you just know, okay?‚Äù I shot back. ‚ÄúAnd frankly, I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs anybody‚Äôs business.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I gotta work the door,‚Äù Andy said, making a hasty retreat while Steve and Helen slipped into a booth in the corner.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying, you worked so hard for this promotion, and when you finally get it, you do something impulsive like this,‚Äù Audrey said.

‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm not discussing her with you. Besides, you lost all rights to talk to me like this after you bailed on me that night at the Underground,‚Äù I fumed.

‚ÄúOh, so you really want to go there, huh? How about you making out with my best friend all night in front of me at Tropics after I invited you there?‚Äù she retorted.

‚ÄúOh, stop! Like I ever had a shot with you, Little Miss Better-Than-Everyone,‚Äù I snapped.

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôll never know now! I can tell you that,‚Äù she exclaimed.

I was ready to tell Steve to drive them home and walk out. But he was buried so deep in the back of the booth with Helen, I was afraid he‚Äôd poke my eyes out if I disturbed them.

Audrey was sitting with her back to me, fuming at this point. I guess all the passive-aggressive games we‚Äôd been playing with each other for so long had finally blown up.

We only spoke when Andy came over, and even then it was through him, like he was our translator. The second he went back to working the door, we turned our backs on each other and fixed on the Yankees game playing on the corner TVs.

At ten o‚Äôclock, Steve finally emerged from his lair.

‚ÄúListen,‚Äù he muttered in my ear, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with you two, but I‚Äôm leaving with Helen. You gotta take Audrey home.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be serious,‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready to strangle each other and you expect us to be alone in a car together?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs exactly what I expect. I‚Äôll call you tomorrow.‚Äù

And just like that, he and Helen slipped out the front door, quick goodbye to Andy and gone‚Äîwithout so much as a word to Audrey.

When she realized what happened, she rounded on me. ‚ÄúYou put them up to this. No way I‚Äôm getting in a car with you again. I‚Äôll call a cab first.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease. Stop flattering yourself. I‚Äôm not letting you anywhere near my car. You can hitchhike for all I care.‚Äù

Andy, the yenta, had been listening. He strolled over, looking like Henry Kissinger sent to broker a ceasefire.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not taking a cab home, and she‚Äôs definitely not hitchhiking. You two got one week left together before you‚Äôll probably never see each other again. You know I‚Äôm right about that. So‚Äîget in the car, turn up the radio so you don‚Äôt hear each other, and get it over with.‚Äù

We both mumbled ‚Äúokay‚Äù to Andy, but still refused to look at each other.

We said goodbye to Andy separately, of course. She got in the car‚Äîno way I was opening her door‚Äîand she didn‚Äôt bother to unlock mine from the inside.

I cranked up the radio like Andy suggested. Rod Stewart was belting Some Guys Have All the Luck. Steve, maybe, but definitely not me tonight.

When I hit the Cross Island, I realized I had no idea where she lived. I reached for the dial to turn the music down, but before I could say a word she said, ‚ÄúGet off at the next exit.‚Äù

I kept the volume low so I could hear her directions. A squirrel darted across the road and I swerved to miss it.

‚ÄúProbably wish that was me,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúNah. If it was you, I wouldn‚Äôt have swerved,‚Äù I shot back.

We both let out a nervous laugh as I pulled up in front of her house. She got out without looking at me, tossed a quick ‚Äúgoodnight‚Äù over her shoulder, and started toward the door.

I rolled the window down. ‚ÄúHey, Audrey,‚Äù I called.

She stopped, turned halfway.

‚ÄúI hate you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut I love you. Never forget that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou better love me,‚Äù she smiled, then turned and walked inside.

I waited until the door shut behind her before heading back to the highway. It was, somehow, the perfect ending to a thoroughly imperfect love.

Chapter Ninety-Seven

Steinberg called me the next morning asking if I could give him a hand. He was renting a U-Haul to haul all his old furniture to the junkyard and then move Angie‚Äôs bedroom set and living room furniture into his apartment.

They were keeping his dining room table and chairs, since that was brand new‚Äîa birthday gift from his sister, who had gotten tired of picking splinters out of her arms and ass from his old corroded set.

I told him of course I‚Äôd help, especially since this was part of clearing out what would be my new apartment. Angie was leaving us her table and chairs, which were in good shape, so all Mary and I had to buy was a bedroom and living room set.

We started at ten in the morning and wrapped up around six. There wasn‚Äôt a ton of stuff, but with four flights of stairs at Stein‚Äôs place and three at Audrey‚Äôs, I figured I didn‚Äôt need to do any more lifting for a while.

With that settled, Angie and Jeff‚Äôs place was official. She moved in for real that night and had us over for dinner the following Wednesday.

She served matzo ball soup from her Jewish grandma‚Äôs recipe and baked ziti from her Italian grandma‚Äôs‚Äîlike celebrating Passover and Easter at the same table.

Danny and Diane arrived just as dinner was being served. Danny had to cut out right after dessert, leaving Diane none too happy, though she promised the next time they‚Äôd stick it out until the end.

The night rolled along with stories of our neighborhood misadventures‚ÄîAngelo Rug, Vinny Muscles, Joe Pep‚Äîthe kind of tales we could recite word for word, and the girls were cracking up hearing them fresh.

At one point Angie shook her head and said, ‚ÄúWhat have we gotten ourselves into?‚Äù
‚ÄúToo late to back out now‚Äîyou had me dump all my stuff,‚Äù Stein shot back, and we all broke up laughing.

Before Danny and Diane left, Stein uncorked a bottle of wine, and we raised our glasses. A toast to friendship‚Äîthe kind built to last.

In just two weeks, Mary and I would be in our own place, and we already knew we‚Äôd be gathering again there, starting a new chapter together.
‚Äî‚Äî
I walked into work for my last week at the Xerox office. Monday still felt normal‚ÄîFriday was still a long way off.

As usual, Valerie loaded up my new box, and by 8:00 I was running jobs, plopped on my stool with rock music blasting in my ears and Muscle and Fitness spread across my counter top.

I took my breaks and lunches with the same rotating crew as always‚ÄîAndy, Dude, Eddie, Angel, and Kenny. Between dinner at Steinberg and Angie‚Äôs place and these daily breaks, I realized how much laughter glued friendships together. It tied everything up and wrapped it in a red bow.

The conversations never changed‚ÄîDude going on about the local and chasing fraudsters, Andy‚Äôs hopeless attempts at wooing Chrissy Gable, Eddie‚Äôs unrequited love for Dale, Angel‚Äôs ‚ÄúHe got her good‚Äù movie reviews. At least Kenny was coming with me to the new job, carrying a piece of continuity forward.

Before I knew it, Monday had rolled into Friday. Jack put Rob on ‚Äúmy‚Äù machine‚Äîhis machine now‚Äîand told me I could help Darryl with deliveries if I wanted, so I could make my goodbyes. He said I could leave anytime after lunch.

Darryl shook his head. ‚ÄúHard to believe when I come in Monday there‚Äôll be no more Gerry here.‚Äù
‚ÄúThink how I feel,‚Äù I laughed.

We loaded up the cart and started our trek. First stop was the typing pool. We dropped a few jobs at the front desk when Barbara, the supervisor, waved me over.

‚ÄúAudrey called out this morning,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúShe told me she wanted to see you but hates long, sad goodbyes. Then she added‚Äî‚ÄòOh, and tell him he better love me.‚Äô‚Äù

For once, I didn‚Äôt try for a snappy comeback. I just said, ‚ÄúTell her she knows I do.‚Äù

It felt fitting‚ÄîLucy pulling the football away one last time. That was Audrey. She‚Äôd always be my unrequited crush, the one I could almost touch but never quite hold.

‚ÄúCome on, G, we gotta get going,‚Äù Darryl said, snapping me back.

We hit the mailroom, then worked our way up to corporate headquarters on the 27th floor. Talking baseball and football on the ride up, handicapping tonight‚Äôs pitchers from memory‚Äîit felt like having Steve back already, which would be true come Monday.

Back in the office, I shook Darryl‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúThanks for one last trek.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo problem, G. Call me on the wall phone if you ever need me to pick you a winner.‚Äù
‚ÄúI sure will. Who doesn‚Äôt need that?‚Äù

At ten o‚Äôclock, Gladys broke out her famous chocolate peanut butter cupcakes. I rounded up the break crew‚ÄîCharlie, Eddie, Angel, and Kate, Tony Trap, and Phil from graphics‚Äîfor an impromptu goodbye party.

I hugged everyone goodbye, starting with Gladys, Valerie, and especially Dina‚Äîmy work mom. Dude and Eddie promised to drop by Thomas Street, and I said the same. We had plenty of Mets games, boxing matches, and bar nights ahead of us.

By noon, the crew had cleared out. I spent my last hour hanging at my old station with Rob and Dina. I told Dina about Andy‚Äôs bar send-off, and she was glad it ended the way it did. She liked hearing I was all in with Mary now.

Rob was expecting his Oakland job to come through sooner rather than later. I told him to keep me posted.

At one o‚Äôclock, I headed out. I thanked Jack for everything. We shook hands and told each other to call if we ever needed anything.

Andy and Dude took the elevator down with me and walked me out. We knew we‚Äôd still see each other‚Äîbut not every day anymore.

‚ÄúNow that you know how to get there, you could bring your real girls to my bar without all the stupid drama,‚Äù Andy barked.
‚ÄúAnd you can both swing by Farrell‚Äôs for a couple of cartons on tap,‚Äù said Dude.

We shook hands and traded bro hugs before I turned up Lispenard Street to catch the N train home.

Chapter Ninety-Eight

Gerry woke up Monday morning at 4 a.m., too wired to sleep, his mind racing over his first day as a Digital Communications Technician for Broadway CSO at 33 Thomas Street. A big leap from running Xerox copies and making deliveries at 32 A.O.A.

The adrenaline was buzzing through him. He wanted to get up, but it was way too early. He rolled to his side, deciding just to rest until six.

Next thing he knew, Tina was nudging him awake with a hot cup of morning espresso‚Äîthe usual wake-up call.

He hit the shower, cranking the water cold to shock himself alert, then threw on the standard tech uniform: jeans, a T-shirt, and sneakers.

Down at the table, Pop was already seated. Tina had put out slices of white toast and another pot of espresso. Gerry wolfed down a couple pieces, washed them back with a slug of coffee, talked a little baseball with Pop, then kissed them both goodbye and headed out the door.

Walking up the block felt second nature‚Äîhe‚Äôd been doing it his whole life. But that routine would soon change. Starting next week, he‚Äôd be living with Mary in their apartment on 17th Avenue and Bath. The thought didn‚Äôt scare him, but it carried a sense of loss. Change always does.

At the train platform, he spotted Andre, decked out in a brown suit he wasn‚Äôt required to wear, complete with a red, white, and blue tie.

They waited about ten minutes for the next N train. Once aboard, Andre leaned against the door, and Gerry grabbed an overhead bar.

‚ÄúTrooper‚Äôs playing the Factory again Wednesday,‚Äù Andre said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still dying to see them. Missed the last time on account of my stomach.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm all in,‚Äù Gerry said. ‚ÄúAs long as you‚Äôre driving‚Äîand you keep me a safe distance from Wendy.‚Äù

‚ÄúDeal. I‚Äôll get between you like an O-lineman protecting his quarterback,‚Äù Andre laughed.

At Pacific Street, Andre transferred to the RR. Gerry stayed on, leaning against the door, eyes closed, dozing a little until sunlight streamed in across the bridge. It was a beautiful morning, in more ways than one.

He got off at Canal Street, as usual, even though the RR to City Hall would‚Äôve been closer to Thomas Street. But it was early, and there was comfort in grabbing a bagel and coffee from his favorite deli on Beach Street. He sat on a bench outside, eating breakfast while skimming the Post. When he finished, he stuffed his used napkins into the empty cup and tossed it in the trash can on the corner.

Time was running close. He walked briskly up Hudson, then turned onto Thomas Street.

Steve was already on the front steps, flipping through the Daily News.

‚ÄúHey, Buddy,‚Äù Steve grinned.

‚ÄúNice to see a friendly face first thing,‚Äù Gerry said. ‚ÄúWhen‚Äôd you get here?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout ten minutes ago. My brother already went in, but I told him I was waiting to walk in with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what are we waiting for?‚Äù Gerry said, echoing Mickey in Rocky II.

They climbed the stairs side by side and pushed through the doors together‚Äîtwo friends starting a different kind of trek.",1,1756845478.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

Yesterday, I woke up broke as usual, scrolling through my phone with the hope that I‚Äôd stumble on something new. Is it just ME, or does every ‚Äúmake money fast‚Äù app feel like a scam? üòÇ

But dude‚Äîtoday? I actually made **$100 in one day** just by‚Äîget this‚Äîtest driving apps. LITERALLY. On my phone. I am both confused and *high-key* hyped, because, like... how did I not know this was possible??

So here's 100% how it happened, step by step. Not keeping it to myself‚Äîlet's all get some of this crazy easy cash:

---

**What I Did:**

- Signed up at **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** without expectations. Because, of course, ‚Äúeasy money‚Äù is usually just clickbait, right?!  
- Downloaded like 6 random new apps they told me to check out. Just literally pressed install.
- Played a puzzle game. Added my birthday to an onboarding survey. You know, the stuff you do anyway just to access freebies or get rid of ads.
- Sent one APP review. (I swear, it was weirdly fun to roast a broken calculator.)
- And then... the kicker... got paid for each tiny task.  
- I literally refreshed my balance and the dollars stacked up. First it was $5.49. Cool. Then $8. Next was $20. By end of the day? **$104.37.** Mind BLOWN.

---

**Freaking Out Yet? Here's Why This Works:**

- App creators desperately need testers to find bugs & review so they look good on app stores.
- Companies PREFER regular users‚Äîthey want feedback from humans, not robots (LOL, sorry AI friends).
- **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** makes those connections. Easy af.

---

**Some Random Thoughts & Tips:**

- If it looks too complicated, move on. **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** just asks for quick tasks‚Äînothing sus, no credit card nonsense.
- Time spent: About 2 hours between Netflix episodes. That‚Äôs less than $1 cup of coffee an hour‚Äîexcept way BETTER.
- Don‚Äôt stop at just one app. Smash through a few, testing different categories (games, photo editors, weird-yoga ones), and the $$ adds up fast.
- Use a clean email! If you‚Äôre as paranoid as me, don‚Äôt give them your main one.

---

So‚Äîis anyone ELSE as confused and amazed as I am? Either the world is secretly handing out money for bored phone addicts, or I‚Äôve been low-key missing out my whole life.

Honestly: why didn‚Äôt I find **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** months ago?!  
IMO, if you want a legit way to make a little side cash, and your screen time is embarrassing anyway, try this!!  
Not an ad. Not sponsored. Pure, bubblegum-sweet *surprise* from someone who thought it was impossible.

If you know other gems like **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** (or want to ask me exactly what apps paid out), drop your wisdom below. Let's make the algorithm WORK for us!

1n6umzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trendinfo/comments/1n6umzi/from_socks_to_surreal_sheep_my_accidental_descent/,**From Socks to Surreal Sheep: My Accidental Descent Into AliExpress‚Äôs Wool-Covered Wonderland üêëüöÄ**,"Okay but hear me out‚Ä¶ has anyone else fallen down the *AliExpress ‚Äúmost sheep‚Äù rabbit hole*??? üöÄ I went in looking for something totally normal (literally socks) and suddenly the search results are like: sheep lamps, sheep slippers, sheep-shaped humidifiers‚Ä¶ even what looked like a sheep backpack for cats??? I‚Äôm sitting here staring at my screen wondering if ‚Äúmost sheep‚Äù means it‚Äôs the products that *look like sheep*, or if AliExpress is secretly ranking which sheep-themed items are trending the hardest.  

I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a weird translation quirk or if there‚Äôs actually an underground obsession with sheep products that exists over there‚Ä¶ but honestly, I kind of love it.  

- Sheep plushies with eyes that follow you (cute but also freaky)  
- Sheep pillows you could probably disappear into and never come back  
- mini sheep figurines that look way too detailed to only cost $3  
- AND, the kicker‚Ä¶ a device that looked like a charging dock with tiny *sheep heads* stuck on it.  

Every single one of those things has reviews like, ‚ÄúExactly as described and very soft‚Äù or ‚ÄúQuality sheep, arrived fast.‚Äù Quality *sheep*?? That‚Äôs a statement I never thought I‚Äôd read in an online review shop but now I can‚Äôt stop searching for more.  

And it feels crazy, because when you keep scrolling it‚Äôs almost like AliExpress thinks we seriously want sheep in every aspect of our lives. Cooking, sleeping, walking, decorating‚Ä¶ is this the *true future of consumerism*?? One homogenous shopping cart with lots of sheep things bundled in next to random cables???  

But then again, this is why I both love and am completely confused by AliExpress. Because there you are on a Tuesday looking for a phone case, and then you *blink* and the algorithm has you contemplating if you should adopt a small ornamental flock of plastic lambs for your coffee table setup.

So now I‚Äôm left with so many questions:  

- Is AliExpress lowkey a gateway to niche sheep obsession?  
- Does ‚Äúmost sheep‚Äù equal ‚Äúvery cheap‚Äù in a mistranslated catalog system?  
- Am I going to wake up tomorrow with no memory of why I ordered a set of LED-lit wooly sheep mugs??  

Honestly, I can‚Äôt even be mad though. Because one thing AliExpress taught me today: you open their site thinking you‚Äôre rational, efficient, and practical ‚Äî and you leave being the proud digital shepherd to eighteen carted sheep items you weren‚Äôt even searching for.

A frightened homeless person got up and scooted away. The animal emerged from the shadows to reveal, not some monster, but a skinny hairless cat, whose collar said, ‚ÄòMystiKat.‚Äô The Sphynx cat froze, and crouched down, when he heard someone running into the alley. A teenaged undocumented immigrant boy was chased by two men, one who got close enough to shoot a dart gun at him. He went down quickly with a whimper. The shooter shouted ‚Äúbullseye‚Äù as the two of them laughed as if it was a game. And, as they hauled him up, one said, ‚ÄúCome on sweet young thing, the Deltas are gonna make you a star!‚Äù He saw the cat and took a cruel kick at it. The cat hissed, and scurried off the way he‚Äôd came in.

At a late-night diner, Dr. Shea welcomed Leo‚Äôs female partner to their table. Agent Wesson laid a newspaper on the table, with the headline showing, and whispered, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt make this shit up‚ÄîMurder at a Hollywood Premiere.‚Äù

Dr. Shea quipped, ‚ÄúI heard the box office sucked last month.‚Äù Seeing they weren‚Äôt smiling, she followed up with, ‚ÄúWell it did, I looked it up on IMDb.‚Äù They still didn‚Äôt smile. ‚ÄúOkay, okay, I take that back.‚Äù¬† She briefly looked at the photo and first paragraph of the story. ‚ÄúSo, some ego-maniac actor, with a weight issue, was found dead in the bathroom at a movie premiere?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know what it takes to break someone‚Äôs neck?‚Äù

‚ÄúSome military training?‚Äù Dr. Shea couldn‚Äôt help herself, and deadpanned, ‚ÄúBut. did he have it coming?‚Äù

Leo interjected. ‚ÄúWell, apparently, he was a bit of dick, right Agent Wesson?‚Äù

Wesson replied, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still gruesome. And, freakin‚Äô mysterious. But it doesn‚Äôt stop there, check this out.‚Äù She pointed at another headline and read the first paragraph: ‚ÄúA Hollywood producer was convicted Tuesday of two counts of first-degree murder for the drug overdose deaths of a model and her wannabe friend, along with charges of sexually assaulting seven other women.‚Äù

Dr. Shea was distracted by that hairless cat, which walked by the diner‚Äôs window. ‚ÄúDr. Shea?‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, there was this weird-looking cat outside.‚Äù She pointed but the cat had vanished. ‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs gone. Anyway, hasn‚Äôt Hollywood been known for suspicious deaths from Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood, Bob Crane and David Carradine, and also savage murders like the Tate-LaBianca killings?‚Äù

The Agent said, ‚ÄúThen there‚Äôs the horrible mutilation death of Elizabeth Short, who the media dubbed the ‚ÄòBlack Dahlia,‚Äô another wannabe who was described as an ‚Äòadventuress‚Äô who prowled Sunset and Hollywood Boulevards.‚Äô The Black Dahlia case has never been unsolved, 80 years on! I mean, what monster left her with that gruesome Glasgow Smile?‚Äù

‚ÄúGlasgow, what?‚Äù

‚ÄúA wound that‚Äôs made by a cut from the corners of a victim's mouth up to the ears, leaving an impression in the shape of a smile.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, like Joaquin Phoenix in his Oscar-winning turn in *Joker*?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou a fan of going to the movies. Dr. Shea?‚Äù

‚ÄúMakes a nice break from the algorithms, formulas and the periodic table of elements, if you get my drift.‚Äù She took a bite of her food, then pointed at the headline: ‚ÄúI guess this city can be tough on Hollywood hopefuls.‚Äù Dr. Shea‚Äôs comment surprised Leo but she just shrugged: ‚ÄúSorry, Investigatore, but according to neuroscience, we are basically a highly orchestrated symphony of quintillions of different interrelated chemical reactions per second. So, coming from a scientific background, I can be a little non-emotional about things.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom dust to dust, Dr. Shea?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo be frank, yes,‚Äù she nodded.

‚ÄúAnyway, on an added note, I read of a sex offender, who‚Äôd been released from prison, and was just found at the Agua Caliente Indian Reservation near Palm Springs, all tied up, with his organs eaten out.‚Äù

Dr. Shea responded while she Google-checked her phone. ‚ÄúYou know, in the Greek legend, Zeus chained Prometheus to a mountain and sent a raptor to slowly peck out his liver, which would regenerate each night, ensuring a perpetual torment. But that‚Äôs just a myth.‚Äù

Wesson continued: ‚ÄúListen, LA‚Äôs not my area of expertise, but I‚Äôve been tracking brutal attacks in the Southwest, near ancient Navajo lands. Now, this sex offender‚Äôs death near more Indian lands. In the previous cases, they involved young female and male victims who‚Äôd been assaulted. A couple of the victims I spoke to admitted they‚Äôd lost consciousness but they both had the same fragmented memory, that some giant raptor swooped down and dragged their attacker off, which allowed them to escape but that was it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that why you‚Äôre here, Agent Wesson?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I owe Leo a big favor, from before, so, yes.‚Äù

Shea wondered, ‚ÄúMythical creatures aside, what are you thinking‚Äîsome vigilante gone wild?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, by some mythical bird creature, bent on revenge. And that‚Äôs why we sought you out, Dr. Shea. ‚ÄòCause we‚Äôre sort of out of our league here.‚Äù

Dr. Shea sipped her coffee as she looked back out the window. But there was no more sight of the mystery cat. She calmly added, ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôve heard of a Shaman who lives out this way. A traditional medicine man, who happens to have also trained in modern medicine. Maybe you could consult with him, if you‚Äôre into Native American myths?‚Äù

‚ÄúI knew we‚Äôd come to the right person, Agent Wesson,‚Äù said Leo.",2,1756844863.0,shortscifistories,1,1.0,False
1n6ulng,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tariffs/comments/1n6ulng/brazilian_coffee_tariffs_and_canada/,Brazilian Coffee Tariffs and Canada,The latest information on Canadian coffee is that the vast majority of green beans are first imported to the US and roasted there before being further exported to Canada an thus will be subject to the 50% tariff on the beans. This is likely to cause some shifting of the trade to expand the number of Canadian roasters to import directly from Brazil thus cutting out the business of the American roasters. The US roasters should have discussed the concept of cascading tariffs in their lobbying efforts although it is not clear that they would have succeeded since it seems Peter Navarro failed to grasp this concept during his study of the International trade publications of Ron Vara.,3,1756844856.0,Tariffs,2,1.0,False

1n6uiyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTSC/comments/1n6uiyy/important_message_to_the_1st_years/,Important Message to the 1st Years!,"Hi, I'm a fourth year at UTSC and I've seen and experienced my fair share of nonsense. To commemorate the first day of school, here are some tips I like to tell new people.
1. USE THE CAMPUS FACILITIES! Yes, it's part of your tuition, so make sure you use any and every service offered by the university whenever you please. Academic Advising? Do it. Pan Am? Sign me up! Career Services? Yessir! The university assumes you use everything you pay for, so prove them right!
2. BRING YOUR OWN FOOD! I know it's tempting to see (and smell) all the cuisine at UTSC, but it's all overpriced, usually has long lines, and the food is mediocre at best. Set aside some time to prepare meals over the weekend, or at least eat off campus. This will save you a lot of money in the long run, trust me.
3. TALK TO YOUR TAs/PROFS! You literally paid for their assistance, and you better believe most of them are happy to provide it. Office hours, emails, even catching them quickly after class is a sure-fire way to get some questions answered. Even if you feel good about something you are about to hand in, run it over with a TA or prof to ensure that grade is high. They don't bite. 
4. DON'T SKIP CLASS! Yes, a clich√©, but a lot of profs say and go over things that just aren't in any slides, especially once you start taking higher level classes. Get your bum to class, if you're tired drink coffee. But it's PROVEN that on average people who attend class do A LOT better overall in the course.

Long time lurker first time poster. I 25F was diagnosed with Cirrhosis in August of 2023, due to prolonged severe tricuspid regurgitation leading to a build up of blood and pressure in my liver. The build up has caused both my liver and spleen to be enlarged (my liver is 2-3x the size it is meant to be) and led to a significant amount of damage to my liver. In June of 2024 I got my tricuspid valve replaced which fixed the tricuspid regurgitation, but did not make my liver any smaller. Before my surgery I had the whole plethora of symptoms related to liver failure(neasua, extreme fatigu, HE, ect), but after I was feeling much better until about a month ago.

Unfortunately in the last month or so my symptoms have all started to flare up again. I am not looking for medical advice of any kind. I have reached out to my doctor already and am working with him on this as well, but was wondering if you all had any tips and tricks that help you manage your symptoms?

I know most of the basic ones, but am open to try just about anything at this point. I work full time and am worried I am going to lose my jobs since I haven't been able to preform to my normal degree.

My symptoms/issues: 
- EXTREME fatigue - I can not make it through an entire day without a nap. I get these episodes where if I don't lie down within the next few min I will fall asleep sitting at my desk. I have tried coffee, teas, those sadness super bright lights, moving around... nothing seems to help but open to any and all suggestions
- neasua - Probably my most dangerous symptom as previously I lost so much weight from not being able to eat you could see all of my ribs. I have asked for some neasua meds that have worked for me in the past, and have tried ginger teas, green teas, neasua drops...ect nothing but promethazine has helped in the past
- Confusion/foggy headedness- I have also been diagnosed with HE (hepatic encephalopathy) and am currently taking refaximin 2x a day. I am mostly just a little foggy, but sometimes have really bad flares where I lose the ability to think/read, very scary. I don't think there is much else to do for this but again if you have any ideas let me know

We have groups for different languages: Spanish, Arabic, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian, Korean, Thai, Turkish, Zulu.

Under the Kendu umbrella you can release products, receive insanely strong social media engagement and sell your product to an already established user base. For example we have energy drinks, coffee, beer, clothes, shoes, video games, spices already and so much more! You can come and join the party too with whatever your interests are. You can also plan IRL events like we have a team in Florida called KenduSTREET who attend lots of festivals and spread the Kendu brand! Or in India we have had Pickleball competitions and also a running club! Whatever it is the KENDU Community will be very appreciative, whether you have been here 1 day or since day 1 this opportunity is open to everyone. **You can explore your creative passions and desires with Kendu!**

Now I do understand if you are only here to make money because admittedly I was at the start but that has since changed. Anyways, at currently 13 million market cap Kendu is an absolute steal, the vast majority of memes are down this year and Kendu is no different, we have around a 21x to ATH, this is literally free money. If you put in $1000, chances are you're gonna make at least $20k this AltSeason whenever it hits. **This is obviously NFA,** but I am certainly investing my money.

The crypto game is a lot about community, community effort is everything and Kendu has this in bags. Check any crypto subreddit, we will dominate it, check any X post we will be there, check on Stocktwits we are a leader etc. This is no accident, if we look at the past all the strongest communities have come out on top from Shib to Doge to Pepe to whatever else you want, historically the strongest communities are the most likely to perform the best in terms of price action. This time its not gonna be any different... 

Kendu is only the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes(it is a very sought after audit), the only other coin to manage this was Pepe. Pepe reached 10 billion market cap outside of a bull run... this just shows the potential that Kendu has. If Pepe can reach 10 billion Kendu can soar past this.

Murad and other prominent crypto people preach community, community, community. 

So why not buy Kendu?

Literal life changing money is on the table and tbh it is the most educated investment you can make rn, coins over 500 million have kinda had most of their pump. Kendu still has a 25x before we reach there current market cap...

Seeing the message‚Äîand realizing it‚Äôs only 1:27 a.m.‚ÄîI send a question mark back before turning from my nightstand to face Abby. Her long, dark-blonde hair is scattered over her face as she lies scrunched beneath our covers. The sight jolts me with fear, knowing George is ‚Äúclaiming‚Äù her as a ticket.

I don‚Äôt know why‚Äîor even what claiming your ticket really means‚Äîbut I‚Äôve grown used to his strange messages on this day. They usually read like riddles, things like:

‚ÄúThe Mountains mark the horizon, the Sun rejoices.‚Äù

‚ÄúLittle peak, little peak is what I seek. Give me your Ticket please.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Sky will crumble when the Mountains separate. Feed me the Sun.‚Äù

But never once has he singled out a person. And never Abby.

As morning fell on us, my 7:30 alarm pulled me awake. Abby‚Äôs side of the bed was empty‚Äîunusual for her‚Äîand a burn jolted up my throat as I fumbled out the door.

Not in the bathroom. Not in the office. Damn it.

I sprinted downstairs, drifting into the kitchen‚Äîonly to see Abby, slightly awake, holding two mugs. Relief and panic hit at once as she set my coffee on the table.

‚ÄúOh my God‚Äîyou‚Äôre in here,‚Äù I gasped, clutching my chest, letting my ragged breathing say more than my words.

‚ÄúGeorge?‚Äù she asked calmly, kissing my forehead and running a hand through my hair.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I managed, ‚Äúbut worse this time.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpill the beans,‚Äù she said, sliding into the chair beside my coffee.

‚ÄúOkay. Around 1:20 last night, I get yet another text from George.‚Äù I tried not to sound spastic‚Äîfailed‚Äîand scooted my chair to face her.

‚ÄúSo he‚Äôs keeping the tradition alive, huh?‚Äù she asked, her mouth still dipping in her cup.

‚ÄúWell, he said‚Äîand I quote‚Äî‚ÄòAbby‚Äôs my ticket.‚Äô I don‚Äî‚Äù

Abby choked, setting her coffee down hard, her eyes suddenly locked into mine.

‚ÄúWere those his exact words?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered, clutching my mug like a shield.

She took a long sip, then turned away and pulled out her phone. Without warning, she spun the screen toward me.

My mug slipped from my hands. Black coffee seeped across the shards, bleeding into the cracks of the floor.

A message from Rebecca:

‚ÄòAlex‚Äôs my ticket.‚Äô

We shared a look of disbelief as she scrolled down slightly, allowing me to read the nonsensical messages from Rebecca:

‚ÄúRejoices with our hands in the air, we feed its beauty.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe tickets we own are missing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Sun will be engulfed; our eyes will set the plates.‚Äù

‚ÄúWha‚Äîwhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I asked in disbelief.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said, clicking her phone off before crouching to clean up the mess.

I stopped her and volunteered instead, carefully picking up the soaked pieces of a World‚Äôs Best Boyfriend mug. I wasn‚Äôt in any rush; I needed the time to gather my thoughts.

‚ÄúKnock, knock!‚Äù

I flinched. The sound snapped me out of my spiraling predictions of what was to come, and in that slip, a large shard of glass sliced across the top of my ring finger. Warm blood oozed from the small cut.

I barely registered it before glancing up and noticing Abby at the door. She took the package from the mailman, but just before shutting the door, her eyes went wide‚Äîlike she‚Äôd seen a ghost. She slammed the door shut, nearly rattling the frame, then collapsed to her knees. With both hands, she rubbed her face in a panic.

‚ÄúLOOK OUTSIDE!‚Äù she spat, her head buried in her arms.

I turned ninety degrees toward the kitchen window.

A moment of silence strung me up like a puppet as I watched George and Rebecca casually strolling down the opposite side of the street. Laughing. Pointing. Until they both turned, locking their eyes on me.

And then, with a single blink, they kept walking.

‚ÄúTh‚Äîthey don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù The words stuck in my throat.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt live here,‚Äù Abby whispered.

I dropped to my knees, unconscious of the glass shards sinking into them. Dread was the only thing running through me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting the keys,‚Äù I said, pressing against my knees to stand‚Äîonly to topple sideways when I realized there was more glass than I thought. Both knees looked like pin cushions, though only a few shards had pierced through my pajamas. I brushed them off and steadied myself.

Abby‚Äîwho I hadn‚Äôt even noticed had left‚Äîreappeared and tossed a box of bandages and two alcohol wipes onto the floor beside me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be in the car,‚Äù she muttered, dangling the keys before vanishing again. The door slammed before her words had time to breathe.

I gathered what I needed and followed, locking the door behind me.

‚ÄúWhere to? My guess is anywhere but here, right?‚Äù she asked, already starting the ignition.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered through clenched teeth, dabbing at my knees as the car rolled out of the driveway.

Then the thought struck me. ‚ÄúN-no, go right. George and Rebecca went left.‚Äù

‚ÄúShit, you‚Äôre right.‚Äù She jerked the wheel, reversing back in and correcting the course. My eyes locked on the sidewalk ahead as we crept toward the complex gate.

After an exaggerated five minutes of silence, we finally pulled up to our local movie theater. Unexpected, sure‚Äîbut maybe the perfect place to take our minds off everything. Even this early, they still ran small titles and draft films.

Walking in‚Äîstill in our night clothes‚Äîwe browsed the options until one stuck out to me.

‚ÄúInstrumental, huh?‚Äù

I picked up the short synopsis. A group of band members get into a car accident and lose their ability to hear. That doesn‚Äôt stop them from making music through other means.

Abby‚Äôs eyes, meanwhile, were locked on The Golden Clock‚Äîa film about a famous clockmaker who murdered his family before mysteriously dying. The title alone gave me a chill, a strange echo of stories we‚Äôd stumbled across before, tales that always seemed just a little too close to reality. But I made it clear: I wanted Instrumental. Something quieter, something that might bring a little peace of mind.

As we headed to our seats, a man in a theater uniform greeted us with a warm smile before handing over a clipboard. Supposedly, we had to sign an agreement to watch the full film without knowing the rating or how it even played out. Since these were newer titles, they were sent here for test screenings‚Äîparticipants like us would leave feedback and testify to the film‚Äôs ‚Äúsoundness.‚Äù

This was only our second time doing this, and the first where we actually had to sign something. Friends always told us this theater was where you‚Äôd stumble across ‚Äúhidden gems.‚Äù Not just competition films, but weird, unnatural ones‚Äîbad acting, missing scenes, whole reels cut out. Basically: error paradise.

We signed, found seats in the back row, and casually watched the faces trickling in.

There were no opening credits. No ‚Äúsilence your phones.‚Äù Nothing. Just a black screen...and a mouse cursor slowly hovering over the play button.

We sat in anticipation as the film began. People were streaming in droves‚Äîan honestly surprising reaction‚Äîfilling the once-empty theater with chatter and energy. After the man made his rounds, retrieving another page from his clipboard, the screen finally shifted: ten minutes of black faded into white.

The sun emerged, bathing the scene in warm light, crickets chirping softly as gravel crunched under unseen footsteps. A sudden cut brought us to a group of friends, silent but singing along in a van rolling down a highway. Joy radiated from their faces‚Äîeach name appearing above their head in crisp letters.

Another hard cut zoomed in on a pair of boots, crushing sticks and kicking up dirt with a dragging, deliberate force.

‚ÄúWas this supposed to be scary?‚Äù Abby whispered, eyes glued to the screen.

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt be,‚Äù I muttered, though even I couldn‚Äôt shake the unease.

The film jumped again, back to the singing friends, their expressions lighting up with excitement‚Äîuntil realization hit them all at once. They pointed forward, and everything went black.

A single, deafening CRASH tore through the silence of the theater, lingering in the air like a pulse. For the first time since the film started, every eye in the room was still. The sound echoed in my chest as if it had never left.

It took an exaggerated two-minute pause‚Äîsirens wailing, car horns beeping‚Äîbefore the film returned to the opening scene of the sun. Slowly, the camera panned down to reveal an abandoned house tucked in a patch of woods.

Abby slid her sweaty fingers between mine as we sat, silent, watching for what felt like forever. Eventually, the screen went black. Metallic clanks and jangling keychains echoed through the theater before the image recolored, sending a chill down my spine. Abby squeezed my hand with desperation.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù she whispered, voice steadily rising.

The camera cut to a roof view: seven beds. Seven chained individuals. Each with a bag over their head. Their panicked squirming sent chills racing up my spine as a tall figure emerged from a barely visible wooden door. His head dipped under the frame, and his slow entrance provoked more terror among the group.

Twenty seconds of that ominous presence passed before the shot cut again‚Äîto a close, motion-filled camera pan across each throat. Men‚Äôs Adam‚Äôs apples bobbed violently; women swallowed hard. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was seeing.

‚ÄúEither this is a top-tier horror movie, or something‚Äôs seriously wrong,‚Äù I whispered, bouncing our intertwined hands against my leg to try to calm my nerves.

Abby let go of my hand, pressing it against her mouth.¬†

The camera panned once more‚Äîand there, a golden ticket was placed on each one of their throats.¬†

I wanted to bolt from my seat and puke, but the silly contract held me in place. I gripped Abby tightly as the screen went black. Moments later, an unrecognizable song began to play‚Äîold at its core, with rhythms and lyrics that seemed stitched from memories of my childhood.¬†

About a minute in, the video cut back to the stage. The group performed in front of a moderately sized crowd, though the camera stayed at the back, unable to fully capture the main singer‚Äôs face. Her eyes darted across the room, scanning. A small zoom out revealed everyone in frame. In perfect, eerie unison, they opened their mouths‚Äîand then, everyone‚Äîincluding the camera‚Äîran away from the sound as if physically repelled.¬†

Before leaving, the cameraman swung the lens back to the stage. Microphones were thrown, kicked, and one performer dropped to their knees, writhing with the horrible, distorted sound they had created. The chaos abruptly faded with a smooth transition: the sun rising over the horizon.¬†

Then I realized‚Ä¶ everyone in the theater was staring at us.¬†

‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs staring at us,‚Äù I whispered.¬†

Before my brain could react, every gaze snapped back to the movie. And there, hands raised, the audience‚Äîapplauding the sun.",2,1756844128.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1n6u6bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1n6u6bn/f4gma_looking_for_a_long_term_partner_to_enjoy/,[F4GM/A] Looking for a long term partner to enjoy.,"Hello, I am Lunari (or just Ari for short), and I am here looking to roleplay with you. I am a 20F, and I feel as if I am literate enough to not have you pulling your hair out at misspelled words or poor punctuation while giving you something to enjoy as well.

What am I looking for: if I'm being genuinely honest, nothing in particular struck my mind. I just want something that can get me hooked onto the world we build. A little place that makes my mind wander as I go about my day, thinking about what I could add to it when I get time. I am NOT into fandoms; I feel as if playing a pre-made character is a bit boring and, to a fault, having a pre-planned personality and having to roleplay with the thought of character assassination just isn't in my cup of tea. But more power to you if you enjoy that kind of thing.

I enjoy slice of life, romance, enemies to lovers, doomed relationships, the cute basic stuff is nice, but what gets me really going is the idea of fantasy and magic. It just amplifies some stories told in a mundane life a bit better romance turning into a bit of forbidden fruit between races, enemies to lovers turning into two mages fighting over who has the better style, only to then realize they push each other for the better. The world building can just give another level of depth to this, the way elves can live longer than an entire generation of humans, yet not have a glistening city stocked with trade and wealth because they are complacent in their long lives, is something that just can't be transferred over to a mundane world.

But the mundane world isn't so bad, I adore a good slow burn-one that is a bit less focused on the world at hand and more focused on us. Instead of going to these fancy, amazing magical places, it focuses on the smaller things, like how we feel in each other's company, the little time we get between classes to talk and laugh, a scene of us at a fair looking out at the seaside sparkling ocean, the non-magical ""magical"" things in life, you know.

If I'm playing one person, then it would be in the first person but if I'm doing a scene where I have to play as multiple characters, then I swap to third. As for typing, I tend to go one to four paragraphs (it all depends on the scene and how much freedom I have I wouldn't want to add fluff to a little setting you've already built up). Unless it's a quick back-and-forth chat between characters, then it would be on the one to two side instead of the four, unless it's a lore dump, explanation, etc. I just like having the parts of dialogue feel like characters talking and not like the Death Note scene of them drinking coffee.

I will reply at least once a day that I can promise you. But with school and a changing work schedule, I can't promise more than that . If I'm free, I will try my best to produce something of decent quality. I am in EST, but most of the time, I am only available during the morning/midday. However on most weekends, I do have a bit of time to myself. If that's where the bulk of our time is spent together, then I wouldn't mind that either. 

Sorry for my long yap, but if you are really interested, then I would love to hear back from you . I may be a bit busy and give you a hasty reply, but honestly, just tell me if you don't like it-I'd rather you be truthful than have me wait on a dead response.

Sincerely yours, Ari.",1,1756843907.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

My experience
- Started Feb '25. When I hit 5mg in April, I had a nasty day of constipation after a camping trip. 2 Doculax, a cup of coffee with a half stick of butter, and a rubber glove later, the beast was conquered. Since then, I've been better about my fiber and water. End of story. 
- Okay, the fatigue with 10mg has been rough, so I'm doing 9mg until I can build up some energy reserves through supplementation and gut healing (working with an Natropath).
