I’ve always been a bit self-conscious about my teeth. Years of coffee and tea had left them looking dull, and while I’ve tried various whitening methods - strips, toothpaste, even some DIY remedies - nothing seemed to give me the results I wanted without causing sensitivity.

After reading several discussions and reviews online, I came across **Laughland teeth whitening**. It claimed to offer professional-level results at home, using a dentist-formulated gel and an LED mouthpiece. Skeptical but curious, I decided to give it a shot.

# What’s Inside the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

When the kit arrived, I appreciated its simplicity:

* **Whitening Gel Pens**: Easy to apply with precision.
* **LED Mouthpiece**: Designed to activate the gel for better results.
* **Clear Instructions**: Straightforward steps to follow.

The packaging was sleek, and everything felt high-quality. The gel pens were particularly user-friendly, allowing me to target each tooth without mess.

# How I Used the Laughland Kit

The process was surprisingly simple and fit easily into my daily routine:

1. **Brush and Dry Teeth**: Ensures the gel adheres properly.
2. **Apply the Gel**: Using the pen, I coated each tooth evenly.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece**: Left it in for 10 minutes while I relaxed.
4. **Rinse and Clean**: After the session, I rinsed my mouth and cleaned the mouthpiece.

I did this once a day for a week. The gel had a mild taste, and the LED mouthpiece was comfortable to wear.

# My Results After One Week

* **Day 1**: No noticeable change, but my teeth felt cleaner.
* **Day 3**: Began to see a slight whitening effect, especially on the front teeth.
* **Day 7**: Teeth appeared noticeably whiter - I'd estimate about 5 shades brighter.

Importantly, I experienced **no sensitivity**, which was a significant improvement over other products I’ve tried.

# What Sets Laughland Apart?

Several aspects made **Laughland teeth whitening** stand out:

* **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: The gel is designed to be effective yet gentle on enamel.
* **LED Activation**: The mouthpiece uses LED light to enhance the whitening process.
* **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients**: Ensures the gel remains potent until use.

These features contributed to a more comfortable and effective whitening experience.

# How Does It Compare to Other Whitening Methods?

* **Whitening Strips**: Often caused sensitivity and provided uneven results.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Helped with surface stains but didn’t offer significant whitening.
* **Professional Treatments**: Effective but expensive and time-consuming.

Laughland offered a balanced solution - effective whitening at home without the high cost or discomfort.

# Tips for Best Results

* **Consistency**: Use the kit daily for optimal results.
* **Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks**: Limit coffee, tea, and red wine during the treatment period.
* **Maintain Oral Hygiene**: Regular brushing and flossing help sustain the whitening effect.

# Final Thoughts

After a week of using **Laughland teeth whitening**, I’m pleased with the results. My teeth are visibly whiter, and I didn’t experience any sensitivity - a common issue with other products. The process was straightforward, and the kit was easy to use.

\*The night was still young on a Friday in the Blue Moon Pack. Some werewolves were still drinking at the usual weekend party, and some were tired enough to sleep early, ready for the Saturday night party. The Omegas still worked hard, except for those forced into a bedroom by more muscular werewolves.\*



\*The posh side of the pack house should have always kept quiet to avoid disturbing the upper class. However, one bedroom was vivacious. The mating smell filled the warm room, along with the moans that neither Beta Lucy nor Gamma Vincent held back.\* 



\*The sweat shone in the dim light on Vincent’s back while his muscular body forced Lucy’s slender figure under him, thrusting in her hard and fast. Lucy dug her nails uncontrollably into the skin on his back, leaving long, red marks on it.\* 



\*Usually, it would have disturbed him, but this time, it made him proud to give so much pleasure to the beautiful Beta. Her long blond hair, brown eyes and perfect shape attracted most of the werewolves in the pack, but only a few of them were brave enough to touch her or go close to her, even if she was flirting with them. Of course, they had a good reason for keeping their distance from her.\*



\*Lucy had reached her climax twice already, and even if Vincent started to feel exhausted, he wanted to give her more to prove that he was worth being in her bed. Like many werewolves in the pack, he knew Lucy's seductive behaviour, making so many wolves fall for her and end up in her bed. Therefore, he wanted to be the one who she would prefer to have sex with when she was in need.\*



\*He watched Lucy’s naturally sizeable breasts bouncing up and down. This view kept him so attracted that he couldn't help but lean closer many times to please her nipples with his mouth and tongue.\*



\*Each time he held a nipple between his teeth, gently pulling on it, Lucy's body trembled a little, and he could feel how her wetness was bathing his stiff shaft. At the same time, he pounded her even more intensively, hoping he would keep himself back from orgasming too soon. He moved from nipple to nipple, hearing Lucy's pleasure, which attracted him so much that he decided he wanted to finish between her round breasts, watching his seeds moisturize her soft skin.\*



""Faster! I am coming!"" Lucy moaned, giving him an order that he must obey.



\*Their moans were even louder, just like the sound of their bodies met with each thrust, when finally he saw her eyes rolling back and her gorgeous body tensed under him. Her moisture was all over his lower abdomen, and he couldn’t be more proud of himself for giving his Beta so much pleasure.\*



\*Hoping that he satisfied the Beta for tonight, he pulled out between her warm and wet inner walls, and he moved above her chest, putting his palms against the headboard of the bed.\*



\*Lucy knew what he wanted, and she was in the game, feeling grateful after her three orgasms. He moved his shaft between her breasts. Lucy pushed the big boobs together, massaging the stiff shaft that was wet from her juices, letting him get his reward. What's more, as she enjoyed being with him so much, she lifted her head to reach the head of his cck with her tongue when it appeared with each thrust, which made him moan louder. However, soon, his moans turned into gasping, and he shot his seeds between the perfect breasts with an audible groan. He was enjoying feeling his warm liquid mixing with the gorgeous Beta's wetness between the soft skin. He felt so empty like never before, and he hoped he could satisfy his Beta enough so she would give her other chances to prove his abilities.\*



\*Lucy was smiling as she knew what the Gamma were thinking of. Usually, the werewolves who satisfied him had the same look in their eyes, delighted, hoping to give them another chance to have sex with her. The three orgasms surprised her as well, so she thought she would let Vincent visit her often.\*



\*However, soon, her smile disappeared. She started frowning as a familiar scent, more potent than their arousal’s scent, hit her nose. Lucy was thinking for a moment. What got in her mind was impossible. She planned everything well, just like usual. That must have been her imagination, so she tried to calm herself. But the scent became more substantial, and her heart started pounding faster when she noticed Vincent's frown, as he could smell the fragrance. Her eyes widened in fear when she desperately tried to push him off of her, but it was too late.\* 



\*The door swung open, and the loud, furious growl made Vincent jump off her, meeting his worst nightmare. At that moment, he regretted falling for Lucy and being so weak; the beautiful she-wolf made him believe he could do such a thing without consequences.\*



\*The Alpha stood there himself. The one who had all the right to kill him for stealing someone belonged to him. He couldn’t say a word. His mind went blank as he heard Lucy’s yelling while hitting him, blaming him for raping her. Yes, the gorgeous she-wolf, who he had just satisfied three times in a row, now acted like he was the bad guy and she was a victim only.\*



\*But Lucy’s sudden turn couldn’t bother him then, as the Alpha, Lucy’s mate, walked over to him. First, he felt his powerful grip around his neck. Then he felt the bedside table’s corner hit his head badly. His blood leaked on the carpet, but he didn’t have time to do anything, as the Alpha punched him numerous times in the head. If the Alpha stopped for only a second, he would crawl on the floor, kiss his shoes, and beg for forgiveness, but that was too late. The pain he felt was unbearable, and he deserved it.\*



\*His open wounds made the Alpha’s fist bloody, but he didn’t seem to care about it, just like he didn’t care about the sound of his bone fractures either.\*



\*The Alpha gone mad. Seeing his beloved mate under someone else made him lose his mind. There was no longer a human side of him. He let his wolf control their body. The Gamma, compared to its Alpha, was weak. Vincent couldn’t do anything against him.\* 



\*Vincent became unconscious, lying lifelessly on the floor in his blood, but the Alpha still couldn't stop hitting him.\*



\*The old Alpha and Beta, Lucy’s father, appeared in the room, and they held the young Alpha. He wanted to brake free of their grip, and finish what he started, but finally the two elder werewolves won. They held the Alpha back from killing the half-dead Gamma.\* 



\*Lucy covered herself using a sheet and sobbed in a corner. She tried to show her weakest side, acting like a fragile, hurt she wolf.\*



\*When the two elders successfully stopped the young Alpha, she stood up, still sobbing, and walked to his mate, trying to hug him.\*



\*“I’m so sorry. This male Gamma was much stronger than me. I couldn’t help it."" she cried. ""I shouted, but no one heard me. Alpha, I feel so ashamed. I know it is hard for you as well, but please forgive me.”\*



\*“Forgive you? Never!” He shouted while gasping for air. He didn't realize that, but the Gamma's blood was all over on his clothes. “You are a fcking whre, don’t dare come close to me again!” He couldn’t hide how much pain he suffered from at that moment. His all world collapsed. He heard rumors about Lucy, but he loved her blindly. The Alpha couldn't believe that his beloved mate would be able to cheat on him. He treated her as his queen, his future Luna, and instead of enjoying the special treatment, she ashamed him in exchange.\*



\*“Son! Stop it!” his father shouted at him. After watching his daughter momentarily, the Beta walked to the Gamma, pulled him up, and threw his unconscious body out of the room.\*



\*“Take him into the prison, "" he ordered the guards, who patiently waited outside, appalled.They looked at each other in disbelief, as they would have expected them to call a doctor for him, but the guards held the Gamma quickly, and they took him away.\*



\*The Beta held his sobbing daughter inside the room and looked at the young Alpha.\* 



\*“You should have protected her better. How come an Alpha let its mate go through this? Where have you been? You should have been here next to her. How could I trust you from now on?”\*



\*“You don’t have to worry about that, Beta.” He stated. “I wouldn’t need your daughter, even if she would be the last female on earth. She is nothing more than a shameful liar, a slut\*.”



“Don’t dare talk about her like that,” the Beta shouted, and he took the first step towards him when they heard the old Alpha shout. “Enough!”



The Beta stopped and looked at the old Alpha with a frown. 



“I’ll investigate the entire case, but till then you all must calm down.” He said, but his son looked at his father in disbelief. 



“You don’t have to investigate the case, father. You would only waste your time. I don’t need her anymore.” The Alpha turned around to look into the sobbing Beta woman’s eyes filled with fear. 



“You will not exist for me from now on. Don't dare come close to me, or talk to me. You are nothing for me, and I regret that I have ever accepted you as my mate.” 



“Son!” His father shouted, but the young Alpha motioned him to let him speak.



“Beta Lucy Norman, I reject you as my mate and future Luna. Don’t dare to appear in my sight anymore. Never!” He shouted the last word like he was out of his mind. His father held him and dragged him out of the room as he saw the Beta was about to attack him, defending his sobbing daughter, who seemed close to fainting.



“Accept my rejection, you wh\*re!” The young Alpha shouted back before they would step out of the door. He wanted to continue, but his father forced him to leave.



“Never! I will never accept your rejection!” She sobbed while she laid her head on her father’s chest.



# Chapter 2 Olivia



\*\*8 years later\*\*



\*It was a rainy day, about three o’clock in the morning. It was a Friday, so London’s streets were full of drunk and drugged people who continued partying on the streets or trying to find their homes.\* 



\*However, the situation in the major hospital's emergency department worsened every minute. Most of the patients got there with alcohol poisoning, and some of them overdosed on some drugs. Many people got involved in fights, which caused broken bones or stab wounds. It seemed like the night was never-ending.\* 



\*“What happened to him?” a doctor pulled the curtain open and stepped to the bed—a man lay there, his arm full of fresh and dried blood.\*



\*“A deep but clear cut on the forearm, Dr. Flores.” A nurse responded to the attractive doctor.\*



\*Dr Olivia Flores was a surgeon in the A&E department. Although she seemed young, her experience and manner of treating people made other doctors and nurses think she had been practising for much longer than she claimed. They weren’t wrong, but they never questioned her further.\*



\*Olivia was a fantastic doctor and very attractive as a woman. She had a slender figure but wasn’t too tall or short. Olivia had natural black hair and eyes like the coldest blue ocean. Her skin was white like she had never seen the Sun, but her full lips were red like blood. She was like a living porcelain doll. Many doctors tried to get close to her, but she refused all of them because she didn’t want to get involved in a relationship.\*



\*She didn’t seek a partner. Even if she was lonely and missed being loved, she couldn’t let others know what she was. She couldn’t let any human realise her ice-cold skin, her no-beating heart and her actual age. Olivia must have kept a secret that the feared creatures from horror movies, vampires, existed, and she was one of them.\*



\*She had a few affairs in her life. She tried to be with other vampires, but their relationships always failed, primarily because of their different eating habits.\*



\*She tried to move into vampire communities, but again, she couldn’t bear the barbeque parties, as the vampires called them, where humans were the threats. Olivia would never forget those nights when the group leader brought some innocent humans to the premises. The fear was written on their faces, and to hear them beg for their life and then cry for their mothers damaged her for her long life. He left immediately, and she promised never to try to live again in such a community.\*



\*But she was a young vampire, only about two hundred years old back then. How old was she now? She couldn’t tell. She stopped counting it after four hundred years while moving around the world.\* 



\*Especially after experiencing the fear of human beings, Olivia never wanted to hurt people, but she needed blood, of course. There was a period in her life when she lived with other creatures, living the same life as her. She found a small community where she felt good again. In a few years, she became part of a group of scientists trying to know creatures other than humans. They examined the bodies and helped them heal when all the doctors failed, but the community members also had the chance to do experiments. Her target was to find a way to live without blood, but she was unsuccessful. During these years, she only practised bearing her hunger, but she did that very well. She needed a sachet of blood each half year, which she always took from the hospital secretly. That was why it was so beneficial for her to be a doctor in the human world.\* 



\*Because she never looked older, she never spent over ten years in one place. Moving was always a lot of work, but it was necessary, as humans couldn’t know their existence. Many believed they existed, but they weren’t allowed to confess that.\*



\*One of the communities’ leaders could execute vampires who couldn’t keep the rules. And that was all the vampire’s biggest fear, including Olivia.\*



\*“I cleaned the wound. A nurse will bandage it for you, Mr. Rest your arm for a few days, keep the bandage dry and clean. My colleagues will inform you when to come back to change it. If it hurts too much, you can take some ibuprofen.”\*



\*“Thank you, Dr.” The human looked at Olivia with gratefulness. Probably, he was involved in a fight, but she didn’t ask. His wound wasn’t serious at all, so there was no need to involve the police.\*



\*She closed the curtain and went to the following folder. Then, she sighed and went to see the next patient.\*



\*At eight o’clock in the morning, she sat down in the hospital’s restaurant. Of course, she bought a coffee, which she never drank, but she needed a break. Not that she was tired physically. She treated twelve lightly injured people, a very ill little girl, and she had three life-saving operations. Even though she was a vampire and stronger than a human, she also loved to sleep. That helped her mind rest, and she hadn’t slept for three days. She looked around and smiled at the thought that she would miss this place.\* 



\*“Are you done?” Another doctor stepped at her table. She looked up at her and nodded with a smile. “Yes.”\*



\*“Well, I wish you good luck in the new place. Hopefully, it won’t be as mad as this one.”\*



\*“Thank you, Laura.” Olivia smiled back. It was her last day here, and she sat at her table with the coffee she would throw away.\* 



\*After she forced herself to stand up, she took her belongings and walked down the hall. At the main reception, everyone said farewell to her and wished her luck with her new job.\*



\*Even though she had experienced it so many times, she still loved the feeling that people would honestly miss her.\*



\*She walked out and sat in her car. Then, she turned on the engine and drove back to her apartment.\*



\*When she stepped inside, the apartment echoed because of the empty rooms and places, just like usual. Even if she was all packed, that changed nothing in the flat. She didn’t like to buy stuff. Because she moved a lot, she didn’t want to be attached to anything.\* 



\*She laid down on her inflatable mattress, and she fell asleep quickly.\*



\*The following day, she showered and got dressed. Then, she had a last look at the place where she had spent the previous ten years. With a sad smile, she stepped out and walked down with her only luggage in her hand. She put the items into her car and drove to her next home, Middlesbrough.\*



\*It wasn’t unfamiliar to her. She used to live here a long time ago.\* 



\*She rented out the flat a few weeks ago. She knew where she was going. When she arrived, she looked around, satisfied. This was her home for the next ten years. She hesitated a lot before moving here, as it wasn’t too far from London, but she wanted to move to the north so much that she only hoped she wouldn’t meet anyone from her past ten years.\*



\*She lit some candles and lay in the bath. Even though her body was naturally cold, she enjoyed the warm water. She loved feeling her body warmed up, and it relaxed her.\*



\*The next day was her first day in the new hospital. It was huge, just like the one in London, but this one looked colder. She had worked here before, but the entire building looked different at that time.\*



\*“May I help you?” A young blonde receptionist asked her when she stepped to the desk. Olivia smiled at her.\*



\*“Yes. My name is Dr. Olivia Flores. This is my first day here.”\*



\*“Oh…” the receptionist looked at her surprised. “I call someone to come. Which department?”\*



\*“A&E.”\* 



\*As the woman stood up and walked to another phone, Olivia’s gaze was fixed on someone. He stood there, and he probably heard everything.\*



\*When their gazes met, Olivia felt something unfamiliar. She couldn’t describe that feeling, but her heart probably would have beat crazily if her heart had beat.\* 



\*The man’s gaze remained serious, and he didn’t look away. They were staring at each other for a few moments. The man had black hair and an unusually muscular body, and he was a little taller than Olivia. His skin was white, but probably he enjoyed the Sun a lot, and his eyes were brown. She felt like the air froze, and she could only think of what he was and that they would work in one place.\*",1,1745837953.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

**Results after 30 days:** I experienced only minor flare-ups, with about 80% of the issue under control.

**What I changed after that:**

* Switched to **Vichy Dercos** (Oily Scalp version) shampoo. (15$ in my country)
* Started using **Uriage DS** cream daily. (10$ in my county)

**Results after 3 months:** If I eat gluten or dairy, it doesn’t flare up immediately, but if I indulge heavily over a few days (like 3 days in a row), it does come back. A slice of bread or a bit of cheese doesn’t seem to trigger it, but if I have coffee or cheesecake? That’s when the flare-ups happen.

  
Then consulted two dermatologists, both from different countries, to ask about any potential long-term side effects of using Vichy Dercos and Uriage DS.

Both doctors shared their insights:  
Dercos: You may use twice per weak  
Uriage: No problem with daily usage

You may now ask me, “If I don’t wash my hair every day, it gets either dry or oily, and a flare-up occurs. Is that normal?”

I was in the same situation until I changed my diet. Now, I wash my hair every 3-4 days because it no longer gets red, itchy, oily, or flaky—it looks great.

A few days ago I started to take Vitamin D and B12 to see if it will make more improvement but I share updates in 3 months again.

Do I eat gluten now? of course but minimal. If I eat a sandwich, I give 3 days for me body to process then eat again. Not as a daily habit.

Do I eat dairy now? Milk no (I hate milk) but a few cheese time to time thats all.

So basically our body says: Eat green, eat healthy, sleep well and dont strees that much. Another note: If I eat glute/dairy/process food etc shampoo and face cream doesnt help at all :) so this is coming from ''inside''

1k9sgtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1k9sgtk/that_monday_morning_feeling_where_your_week_goes/,that monday morning feeling where your week goes off the rails by 9:07 am? yeah...,"morning managers, hope the coffee's strong today.

you know that feeling? monday morning, you crack open the laptop, take a deep breath, and BAM. email explosion. slack's already a dumpster fire. urgent pings flying left and right. the plan you maybe kinda sorta thought about over the weekend? instantly vapourised.

you spend the next three hours just playing whack-a-mole with everyone else's 'emergencies'. answering questions, putting out fires, getting pulled into stuff you didn't even know was happening. by lunch, you feel like you've run a marathon but somehow haven't moved an inch on the stuff *you* actually needed to get done. the whole week already feels behind schedule.

it's insane, right?

took me way too long, like *years*, to figure out the sneaky little trap here. it's not just the sheer volume of crap hitting us on monday. it's our gut reaction to immediately dive headfirst into the noise. **we open email first. we check slack first. we instantly start reacting.**

and doing that? it's like handing the steering wheel of *your* week over to literally everyone else before you've even figured out where you're trying to go. you start the day reacting, and you never really stop. everything feels urgent, nothing feels important.

so here's the thing that kinda clicked for me, maybe it helps someone else feeling that monday chaos: **defend your first 30-60 minutes like your life depends on it.**

like, physically *don't* open outlook or slack right away. i know, it feels weird, almost irresponsible at first. the urge to check is HUGE.

but instead, use that first little window to just... breathe. reconnect with *your* main goals for the week (even if it's just one big thing). figure out the *very first small step* you can take on one of *your* priorities. *then* maybe mentally prep for the incoming wave - what needs immediate attention vs what can wait?

only *after* you've kinda oriented yourself and set your own intention, *then* open the floodgates.

it sounds backwards, but starting with your own priorities, even for just 30 minutes, before reacting to everyone else's... it completely changes the feel of the day. you're filtering the noise through *your* plan, not just getting swept away by it.

it's not about ignoring people, just about getting your own bearings first so you're navigating the chaos instead of just drowning in it. made a huge difference for me in feeling less like a pinball machine all week.

anyone else wrestle with this? what helps you guys not let monday morning derail everything?",4,1745837002.0,managers,4,1.0,False
1k9sfvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1k9sfvp/cursed_reddit_story/,CURSED REDDIT STORY,"August 31, 2024.



I've always loved reading horror stories. They fascinated me, especially those with a macabre plot twist. I enjoyed reading them while sipping my coffee, but ever since that damned incident last month, I haven't been able to open a single story again.



That morning, as usual, I was browsing creepypasta subreddits while drinking my coffee. I'd practically read them all. But that day, something strange happened. Amid thousands of posts flooded with upvotes and comments, there was one story... with no likes, no comments. Completely forgotten. I clicked. I started reading.



***WARNING.***



The story was cliché. Nothing special. It seemed inspired by those old slasher films where teenagers get massacred. THE IRONY. Just another recycled story among so many. I finished reading and went to work. Another shitty day, with my boss yelling at me as usual.



When I got home, I noticed something strange. The front door was slightly open. At first, I thought I'd forgotten to lock it.



***STOP.***



I entered cautiously. My town wasn't known for high crime rates. I searched the entire house. Nothing out of the ordinary. I tried to forget about it and carry on with my night.



At 1 a.m., I woke up. The hallway light was flickering nonstop.



""Damn faulty wiring again..."" I muttered, going back to sleep.



Five minutes later, I woke up startled by the sound of plates shattering in the kitchen. Horror clichés are pure fiction, RIGHT?



I got up and went to the kitchen. Everything was a mess. I was organized. This wasn't normal.



As I picked up the broken plates, I saw marks... of blood. Messages written:



***YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE READ THAT STORY.***



My stomach turned to ice. How did someone know? This was always my secret hobby. I screamed. I called the police.



They arrived quickly. They collected blood samples. No signs of a break-in. The kitchen didn't even have a window.



Days later, the results: the blood was mine. But how? I wasn't injured. I had no history of sleepwalking. I didn't do drugs.



***OR DID I?***



The police dismissed it as a prank. They warned me. But the messages kept coming. Every night, in different places: on the bathroom mirror, on the bedroom window.



***I WARNED YOU.***



And it wasn't just messages. ""Accidents"" that could have been fatal started happening—coincidentally.



A brick fell out of nowhere, almost hitting me. A pitbull attacked me for no reason. I was nearly run over by a speeding car—I was the only pedestrian on the street. I slipped three times in the shower, with no explanation.



And then my house... caught fire. No cause. I lost everything.



Homeless, I got fired from my job. I had no peace. I moved back in with my parents, but I quickly realized I was putting them in danger.



Now I'm writing this on my phone. If you're reading this, understand: sooner or later, I won't be able to escape. This thing will get me. There's no use fighting.



The story I read... condemned me. And if you've read this far...

## Understanding Your Needs: Who's This Guide For?

This article is tailored for several key audiences, each with distinct requirements and priorities when selecting a metal fire pit. We understand that not everyone is looking for the same features in an outdoor fire pit.

*   **Homeowners:** Seeking to enhance their outdoor living spaces for personal enjoyment and entertaining. Style, durability, safety, ease of use, and price are key considerations. They’re looking for a backyard fire pit or patio fire pit to create a cozy atmosphere.
*   **restaurant/Hospitality Owners:** Prioritizing durable, safe, aesthetically pleasing, and easily maintained metal fire pits for commercial use. Code compliance and warranty are also crucial factors. Often, they're in search of a large fire pit to accommodate a large number of guests.
*   **Event Planners:** Needing portable, safe, and visually appealing metal fire pits for various events. Rental options and bulk discounts may be significant factors.They are trying to find a decorative fire pit that matches the event's overall theme.
*   **Contractors/Landscapers:** Sourcing metal fire pits as part of larger outdoor design projects, focusing on durability, value pricing, and supplier reliability. Offering wholesale pricing is very vital.

## Metal Fire Pit Materials: A head-to-Head Comparison

The material of your metal fire pit is arguably the most critically important factor in determining its durability, longevity, and aesthetic appeal. Let's explore the most common materials:

*   **Steel Fire Pit:** Steel is a popular choice due to its strength and affordability. It can withstand high temperatures and is relatively easy to work with, allowing for various designs. However, steel is susceptible to rust if not properly treated with a powder coating or other protective finish. Both stainless steel fire pit and standard steel options are common, each with pros and cons.Steel wood burning fire pit units offer a classic experience.

*   **Cast Iron Fire Pit:** Cast iron offers excellent heat retention and a classic, rustic look. It's incredibly durable and can last for many years with proper maintenance. However, cast iron is heavy and can be brittle, making it prone to cracking if subjected to sudden temperature changes or impact. Cast iron is less commonly used for portable fire pits, due to its weight.

*   **Copper Fire Pit:** Copper is known for its lovely patina and excellent heat conductivity. It's also naturally rust-resistant, making it a good choice for outdoor use. Though, copper is a more expensive option than steel or cast iron. Copper fire pits often make for an eye-catching decorative fire pit.

*   **Stainless Steel Fire Pit:** Stainless steel offers excellent corrosion resistance and a modern, sleek look. It's also relatively lightweight and easy to clean. However, it can be more expensive than regular steel and may not retain heat as well as cast iron.Stainless steel fire pits are a good choice for those living in coastal areas or other environments with high humidity.

## Fuel Types: Wood, Gas, propane, or Natural Gas

The type of fuel your metal fire pit uses will considerably impact its convenience, cost, and environmental impact.

*   **Wood Burning Fire Pit:** A wood burning fire pit provides a traditional campfire experience with the crackling sound and smoky aroma that many people enjoy. However, wood-burning fire pits require a readily available source of wood and can produce smoke and embers, which may be a concern in some areas. Consider regulations that may apply to wood burning fire pits.*   **Gas Fire Pit:** Gas fire pits offer a clean and convenient alternative to wood. They ignite easily, produce consistent heat, and don't generate smoke or embers. Gas fire pits can be fueled by propane or natural gas.

*   **Propane Fire Pit:** A propane fire pit is portable and easy to set up, making it a good choice for patios and decks.Propane tanks can be easily refilled or exchanged.

*   **Natural Gas Fire Pit:** A natural gas fire pit requires a permanent connection to a natural gas line,which limits its portability. However,it offers a continuous and cost-effective fuel source.Natural gas fire pits are typically more powerful than comparable propane units in terms of BTU output.

## Key Features to Consider Before Buying:

Several factors differentiate metal fire pits on the market. Considering them ahead of purchasing may reduce the chances of returns.

*   **Size and Dimensions:** Consider the size of your outdoor space and the number of people you typically entertain when choosing the size of your metal fire pit. A large fire pit is suitable for spacious backyards, while a small fire pit is ideal for smaller patios or balconies. Consider the fire pit dimensions carefully
*   **Shape:** Metal fire pits come in various shapes,including round fire pit,square fire pit,and rectangular fire pit. The shape you choose should complement your outdoor décor and seating arrangement.

*   **BTU Output:** BTU (British Thermal Units) measures the heat output of a gas fire pit. A higher BTU rating indicates a more powerful fire pit that can generate more heat.
* **Fire Pit with Grill:** Some metal fire pits come with a grill, allowing you to cook food over the open flame. A fire pit with cooking abilities is a great option for outdoor enthusiasts.*	**Portability:** If you plan to move your fire pit frequently, consider a portable fire pit with wheels or handles.
*   **Safety features:** Look for metal fire pits with safety features such as a fire pit spark screen to prevent embers from escaping, and a fire pit cover to protect the fire pit from the elements when not in use. Some fire pits also include a fire pit poker for safely tending the fire.

*   **Durability and Warranty:** Choose a metal fire pit made from high-quality materials with a durable finish to withstand the rigors of outdoor use. A fire pit warranty can provide peace of mind in case of defects or premature failure. Look for long lasting fire pit solutions to minimize replacement costs.

Here is some backround - in June 2024 I started noticing cloudy urine that did not correlate with hydration - seemed to come mainly after eating. In August I got a kidney panel, urinalysis. eGFR was 101, everything was in range except for a higher potassium, which was resolved with retesting (hemolysis is what happened). In August I also did a urine test which came back with trace blood, I have decided not to worry and got it retested in February 2025, dipstick came back negative for blood, microanalysis showed 1-2 rbc, but doctor said its nothing. I kept on having the cloudy urine and still do - but whenever I gave the samples, urine was not cloudy. Bacteria growth of the sample of urine came back negative. 
Basically all bloodwork and urine tests rulled out anything with the kidneys.
I got an ultrasound though because I started having mild right flank pain from the back side, ultrasound of my kidneys and bladder (for the cloudy urine) came back fine back in February 2025.
I am still continuing to see cloudy urine and have R flank discomfort. I bought some urinalysis strips to test the cloudy urine (its yellow in color but not see through) each sample I take comes back with Blood - all sorts of levels- 3+;2+ and 1+. But the blood is always there even when my urine is as clear as water. 
I am very concerned, what can cause this blood in urine? I have no symptoms of UTI, the strip does not show anything else abnormal just blood. I am not on my period, but period is due in 7 days if that means anything. I am worried about cancer or kidney failure. I am due to see urologist tomorrow because the cloudy urine and pain in right flank are not normal.
I have no history of urine systems cancer, although my grandpa died of stomach cancer in his 40s.
I have no high blood pressure, I am not overweight, I am at a complete loss.
I do have hashimotos with a tirad 4 nodule, had an MRI with contrast 1 week ago for my breasts, so not sure if contrast has anything to do with it as my symptoms stayed the same.
Very worried - need some insight on the flank pain with normal ultrasound and kidney function. I have no urgency or anything , I try to drink 2L of water daily, do not consume coffee. Any thoughts? Unable to sleep and function for the last 2 days ever since the tests I have done constantly shows blood in urine.

[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wygr3l/bridgebuilder_in_the_unknown/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1k4dyju/bridgebuilder_chapter_134/)

After an hour and a half of merriment, give or take, things started to settle down. One group had departed after a final round of well-wishes, but there were still nearly three hundred people there. Another hour after that the party had dispersed a bit more, everyone moving slow thanks to the unrelenting amount of food present. Their valiant efforts had put a significant dent in the buffet, several tables reclaimed by people having regrets about how high they had piled their plates.

Things were a little different up in the mayor’s office. Carbon was over the moon, giving the actual newly-entwined a run for their money as far as excitement over the day was concerned. Even though Alex wanted to be down in the thick of it, seeing her this happy worked well to dull any annoyance he felt at his freedom of movement being curtailed by their dutiful security team.

As evening set, a larger group departed and the crowd below thinned further. Kannath finally relented, allowing the recently-re-entwined loose. Carbon got spotted before they were even back on the first floor. 

“Lan Tshalen!” Nata hurried up the stairs towards them, still wearing the blue jacket she had on during the procession and moving like she was about to give Carbon a hug. Or if you were a member of the security team, shank the princess. Could go either way.

Nata stopped short as she noticed the sizable retinue behind them, brown eyes darting from Carbon to the pile of security, ears and antenna lifting in alarm.

Carbon didn’t miss a beat, an easy smile crossing her muzzle as she directed the girl back down the stairs and switched back to Tsla. “Nata, how has the reception been?”

She had not expected that question, but overcame the surprise quickly. “Oh, it- It is overwhelming. There is so much of everything! So many people, tables worth of food... There were four cakes. I did not try two of them because they had milk products, but Kaseya did. Last I saw her she was laying on a couch trying not to nap.”

“Food coma is a thing for the Tsla’o too, huh?” Alex chuckled, coming down the stairs a few steps behind Carbon, someone who he is definitely only friends with.

Carbon nodded as she looked back at him, still talking in Tsla. “It has been some time since I overate, but yes, the urge to lay about and do nothing afterwards is very strong.”

Nata slowed down as they reached the first floor, turning, gaze switching between Alex and Carbon. She had questions that she didn’t know how to ask. Fortunately, Nata didn’t have that sort of *I know what that means* look to her, there was no *Kaseya was right about what the Human meant by ‘very good friends’* action going on behind her eyes right now. She was mostly just confused, ears lifting as she asked her question. “Were you upstairs for the entire reception?”

“Afraid so. Now that we’re back in Confed space I had to phone home about my whereabouts and get updates on the various projects we are involved with back in Sol.” Alex picked this one up. Part of his statement was true, they are involved in various projects back in Sol. It was overwhelmingly a quick excuse that could become ‘I can’t talk about it yet’ very easily should anyone ask. “Good thing I put it off until after the ceremony.”

“Yes. The meeting ran long. We were able to sample some of the food when it was hot, thankfully.” Carbon finished it up, a nod back towards the security team. She made no attempt to quantify what the mostly normal looking Tsla’o had been doing there with them, aside from bringing up meals.

Nata was convinced by this. She clearly just wanted to hang out with her personal hero, but a layer of plausible deniability should she mention it to anyone else was important for now. “Oh, I am sorry to hear that. There is still plenty, if you want anything else. The cakes are really quite good.”

It left Alex feeling guilty. She was just a kid, and they’re piling lies onto her to keep a handful of secrets secure. All because ONI wanted to fuck around. Ok, yes, they were keeping the whole marriage thing secret before the spyware in his systems was found out. That just made it worse because now it was leverage for everybody, not just Eleya. Despite a whole lot of problems, she was well intentioned.

The ONI knew so much already. The Human intelligence agency would be getting a massive amount of this trip sent back with only minor adjustments, as there had been almost no discussion about the spyware, the intrusion package, or the handful of items Eleya said they must not know about. Alex had grown more irritated with them every time he thought about another personal moment he’d have to upload. Maybe the Empire’s intel team could edit out their vows, and a couple of other things. He’d ask. See what they had time for.

“You know, I only had one piece of cake.” Carbon smiled, keeping the situation on the rails, “perhaps I should try the other. Care to lead the way?”

Nata was positively enthused to be volunteered for this. She took them over to the buffet and was a fountain of knowledge about everything there. Except for the table that things with milk products had been banished to.

Fortunately Kaseya, who could still digest lactose, was there piling cheese onto a small plate that was already half covered in brisket. She caught Alex watching her sort some swiss out of the way with a toothpick, and gave him a deadly serious shake of the head. Raw disapproval radiating from the fluffy little gremlin. “You did not get me more cheese.”

Alex could see the earpiece for a translator sticking out of her ear, so unlike the last time they met she’d be able to understand him from the start. “Wow. Excuse me. Who do you think ordered that platter you’re picking through?” Yes, he was a bit defensive about it. He had expected maybe four other humans to be here but had gotten the big one anyway, entirely for her.

It took her a second, but she lit up like a christmas tree. “You did remember!”

“So it is. How could I have forgotten?” Alex actually found her endearing, and it was the least he could do after giving her so much trouble - as far as a child was concerned - when they first ran into each other.

Nata cleared her throat behind him.

“What?” Kaseya didn’t pick up what Nata was getting at, distracted as she had returned to filling the rest of her plate with cheddar. Her ears shifted up, short antenna following a moment later as she looked back at Alex with huge blue eyes. “OH! Thank you!”

“You’re welcome.” He chuckled and turned back to the group as Kaseya wandered off towards Su and the grandmas. Carbon was watching the interaction with a warm smile, arms crossed over her chest and very amused. Alex had to ask, given they had the same fur coloration. “Did you look like that when you were a kid?”

“Mmhm. I would say close, yes.” She idly scratched her chin, pondering his question a little more. “I am told my ears were very large when I was a child, that would be the most noticeable difference.”

“You must have been adorable.” He smiled, about to say that she must have grown into them as they appeared normal size as far as he could tell, but that was tempered as he noticed Nata now *did* have that ‘Kaseya was right’ look to her. Not like he could subtly communicate that to Carbon without it being spotted by the teen standing beside her, who had begun studying them *more* intently. Splitting the group here would probably be a good idea. “Well, I am going to grab some more of that brisket. Plus, I have to say hello to Su. Would be rude to be here and then just ignore her.”

Carbon picked it up quickly, the briefest glance towards Nata letting Alex know. “I have some catching up to do as well.”

Alex tooks his time pursuing what was left of the food, pleased to see that a lot of what he had ordered had been eaten. He ended up with an amount of smoked meats that was probably unhealthy, buuz dumplings, and fried dough of some sort. Nutritional balance was not welcome here, but he didn’t go to shindigs like this very often anyway.

Su was part of the grandma squad now, and they had questions about how a young man such as himself ended up traipsing halfway across the galaxy - Alex did not correct them that it was only across the Orion arm - on an alien ship.

Alex was happy to run down a more refined version of the events that led him to this wedding. Less unsure pauses where he had to figure out how to avoid saying something that was secret, fewer ‘very good friends’ style slip-ups. When he skipped over all the times he had almost died or otherwise been assaulted, the various family-related problems in general... It was a fun travel adventure. There had even been the suggestion that he could make some videos about it.

He had almost let slip that was what Eleya intended to convince Keta and Desaya to do - effectively making a travel vlog as they toured Human places. Take the mystique out of the aliens that the Empire had kept distant for decades, with normal Tsla’o who actually wanted to go explore. Alex wasn’t sure it would pan out, but that was Eleya’s mess, not his.

The tour that Alex originally skipped managed to find him this time around, though it was more of an evening walk around the village and the temporary lodging that had been built. Probably for the best after a second helping of smoked sausage. 

They had gotten two of the planned ten single-family homes installed, which wasn’t exactly how they were being used - adults who were single for whatever reason were being moved into them. They housed five people each, and the bunkhouse living areas were being rearranged to give intact family units and the orphans a little more space without isolating them.

He got to see real, honest to goodness yurts and tipis, too. Made in centuries old, traditional styles, with appropriate materials. They were both a lot more complex than he had previously imagined, not that he had spent a lot of time considering their building methods until now.

 Alex had never once figured he would find himself at the edge of Human space, hanging out with multiple groups of plains nomads and alien refugees. 

Life tends to come at you in unexpected ways.

With the sun below the horizon, the crowd had dispersed save for the fifty or so Humans that were staying the night. Carbon had been chatting with Nata and a few other kids the entire time, apparently, and had even found Nata a Tsla’o comm. Something Carbon would definitely not ever regret doing. Once their group was gathered up and both Captains had done a head count, they collected several kilos of leftovers and headed back to their respective ships after another goodbye.

Alex hoped it wasn’t the last time he saw them.

Everyone retired to their cabins immediately upon arrival. Alex sprawled out on their bed with a groan. That walk hadn’t done enough to win the war against too much barbecue. “When do you think we’ll see the newlyweds next?” Their intentions for each other had been crystal clear on the way back up.

“Tomorrow.” Carbon replied as she hung up her jacket, sitting on the bed beside him to take her boots off. “They are young, but they will still have to eat.”

It was a herculean effort, but he did not make a dirty joke there. Not even a quick one. “They’ll order in.”

Carbon got a quiet chuckle out of that, unwrapping her *daman*. “A bold assumption that the chef will tolerate having his kitchen reduced to making meals for room service.”

“Oh, you got *that* kind of chef?” He had only crossed paths with the chef a few times, and he had stuck Alex as high strung but reasonable. He avoided the kitchen when it would have been in use anyway, it was not too large and had to feed the entire ship. Alex wasn’t going to interfere with a meal to get a cup of coffee.

“No. When I first took possession of the *Tamat sa Na’o*, the style of the time was to have meals only in the dining room unless something significant prevented it. One could not simply decide they were too busy to dine *properly*.” She stood and wiggled out of the rest of her wrap without all the fanfare of unrolling and rerolling it immediately. Naked as a Human would consider it, she stretched and looked back at Alex. “I have not asked to change that, so I suspect it is still in effect.”

His eyes wandered, free from the constraint of having to present a façade of professionalism for public consumption for the moment. There was no pretending right now. He should have felt some relief but it came with the knowledge that he would have to put that mask back on in a few days, and it would have to stay on for a long time when they were back on the Artifact. “Is it so?”

“*Yeah*.” Carbon smiled broadly, sharp teeth on display as she laughed. She got a kick out of him saying traditional Tsla’o stuff like that and had started to reply in kind with phrases he used. “I am going to take a shower.”

Carbon left him lying there on the bed, but didn’t close the bathroom door behind her. He got the unspoken invitation. The water started up, and before he could haul himself and his mild gastrointestinal distress off the bed, their comms jingled at the same time. Well. If it was both of them, there was either something serious happening, or Neya in the group chat. Curiosity got the better of him. 

It was Neya, so he’d make sure everything was all right first.

<I am told the *Tamat sa Na’o* is underway again. How did it go?>

Just checking in, it seemed. <The ceremony was perfect, the reception was wild.> He tapped away at the on-screen keyboard and sent it. The *Tamat* had all the same Empire comm gear the *Starbound* did, and a secure compartment for actual secret communications. He hadn’t asked if that was something a Lan would need, or if Eleya had just assumed Carbon would be otherwise involved in things that required high security protocols. It would send texts quite some distance almost instantly, too.

It jingled again before he could set it down. <What do you mean, wild?>

<Will explain later, busy.> He sent that message, then the Tsla’o equivalent of a winking emoji immediately afterwards, and tossed the comm onto the bed.

Standing up got a rather uneasy grunt out of him, and he put his jacket away - Carbon was very particular about those getting hung back up properly. Not as concerned with the other parts of the ensemble, but he took care of the button-down shirt, too. It was nice and probably hand made.

The comms jingled insistently, messages coming in at a steady pace.

The short walk to the bathroom was heavy with consideration of the future. Alex didn’t want to go back to pretending to be friends or coworkers, or whatever falsehood was convenient at the time. He didn’t want to lie to children. He didn’t want to lie to adults either, but the kids really grated on him.

But that raised the question, what would the trade-off be? One thing he had learned in the past few months is that there would always be something in the balance. What was he willing to give up? Or would there be a price to be extracted?

Eleya probably wouldn’t care much as long as Carbon was happy. It probably wouldn’t jeopardize the Empire’s relations with the Confederation, if the Confed at large even noticed. ONI already knows and they’re fine as long as his wetware phones home regularly.

Alex forced himself to relax his jaw as he stepped into the steam-filled room, gritting his teeth at the mere thought of the Navy’s intelligence arm, his current boss. He pulled the mirror cabinet open and sifted through the bottles within, looking for the all purpose stomach medicine. Antacid, anti-gas, anti-nausea, all in one, and safe for Humans. He popped two tabs in his mouth and swallowed them dry.

They weren’t fine, though, were they? Admiral Argueta had threatened his relationship with Carbon the first time they had met - do as we want or we’ll ship you home, good luck getting off planet after that. They had at least made the job sound agreeable. Go experience their way of life, and write us reports. They must have known who Carbon was related to. There was no way they would have sent him along like that if they didn’t think it would put a listening device next to the Empress.

What would the next task they set before him be? Would they bother with a carrot this time, or just go straight to the stick? If they discovered the tampering, the fact Alex was now a double agent for all intents and purposes, what would they try... He didn’t know that they had limits, if they were willing to secretly load up a civilian with a surveillance system and ship him off to an alien power’s flagship.

They couldn’t have foreseen that the Empress would use him as a payment for Carbon, or the intrusion she required to make sure he was suitable. It did make him wonder if they knew about Eleya’s bloody history with traitors, and exactly how expendable ONI actually considered him.

The door to the shower pulled back a few centimeters, the rush of water suddenly being louder dragging him back to the present. A bright blue eye peeked out of the gap. “Did I hear the comm go off many, many times?”

“Yeah, it was Neya.” He pulled his undershirt off, and discarded the rest of his clothes quickly. Undressed, as a Tsla’o would consider it.

“Is everything all right?” She slid the door open more and a sopping wet arm reached out to pull him in.

He was perfectly happy to comply, eager for a distraction from his previous line of thought. “Oh yeah. She was just seeing how things went.”

“You did not tell her anything substantial, did you?” Carbon gave him a thoughtful hum, a little smirk on her dark lips as she leaned against him, warm in contrast to the cool air pouring in around them. “Just, ah... made it worse?”

“I mean, yeah.” Distantly, the comms jingled again. Alex slid the shower door closed. “I did say we’d fill her in later this time.”

One of those 3 things was not having your date be the two of you interviewing each other, such as about your interests. Dr K suggests doing some activity which leads to a shared emotional state (such as a roller coaster). This leads to emotional bonding.

However now I'm confused because my first meeting which I have planned with a girl in my college is a typical date setting (like getting a coffee) and there is no way of doing some shared activity which Dr K suggested.

So now that that can't be changed, how do I not have the conversation be like an interview? Before watching Dr K's video I felt quite comfortable about that form of a conversation. I would listen to her about her life and interests and understand her, and maybe she'd do the same for me.

But if that is not a good idea according to Dr K (he said the date should be fun), what else can the conversation even be about?

	•	9 in a truck before 24 hours just to make the boss smile, even though everyone knows the truck’s still sitting there half unloaded.
	•	Lie on pet incident forms like it’s a team sport.
	•	Sign off on POGs that are ✨definitely✨ not done (special shoutout to the stores that treat POG signing like a trust fall).

And because that’s not enough excitement —
	•	Let’s throw in random auditors popping in unannounced to make sure we’re “doing what we’re supposed to.” Love that journey for us.
	•	Surprise 20% off sales with no warning… because nothing says “support” like walking into 14 online orders first thing Monday morning with a big ol’ “Good luck, peasant!” energy.
	•	Oh, and let’s schedule inventories, a giant store operating model rollout, massive planner sets and everything else— at the same time. Because who doesn’t love a pressure cooker with the lid about to blow?

But no worries 
it’s definitely the honest, hardworking leaders that are the problem, not the shady ones gaming the system.

# 20 Interior Design Trends 2025: Must-Have Looks Loved by Top Interior Designers in Mumbai

# Introduction to 2025 Interior Design Trends 

As the world evolves, so too do the realms of interior design, mirroring societal and technological shifts. Approaching the year 2025, homeowners and designers alike are increasingly recognising the importance of staying current with emerging interior design trends. These trends not only reflect contemporary styles and aesthetics but also capture the essence of the cultural zeitgeist, embodying the values and preferences of society at large. By observing these changes, one can gain insight into broader themes, such as environmental awareness, technological integration, and the desire for personal expression within living spaces. 

The advancements in technology, particularly in smart home innovations, will profoundly shape interior design in 2025. Features such as energy-efficient lighting, automated climate control systems, and integrated audio-visual setups will become prevalent, promoting a seamless blend of functionality and style. [**Interior designers in Mumbai**](https://www.home2decor.com/) are at the forefront of this evolution, incorporating these innovations into urban spaces while preserving a distinct cultural aesthetic. Moreover, as sustainability continues to gain traction, eco-friendly materials and practices will likely dominate the design landscape, emphasising the need for responsible consumption and mindful living.

While trends serve as a guide, the essence of successful interior design hinges on the personal style and comfort of individuals. As homeowners assess the various trends emerging in 2025, the challenge lies in finding a harmonious balance between modern aesthetics and their unique preferences. This balance can be achieved through creative interpretations of popular styles, resulting in personalised spaces that reflect a homeowner’s identity. Ultimately, the trends in 2025 will encourage individuals to embrace their creativity while remaining aware of the evolving landscape of design. 

# Sustainable Materials: Eco-Friendly Design Choices 

The significance of sustainability in interior design continues to rise as environmental consciousness among consumers becomes more prominent. In 2025, we observe an increased inclination towards using sustainable materials that not only beautify spaces but also promote ecological balance. A variety of eco-friendly materials are making their mark, with reclaimed wood, bamboo, and recycled metals leading the way as popular choices for interior design. 

Reclaimed wood is a prime example of how sustainability and aesthetic appeal can coexist harmoniously. Sourced from old barns, factories, or other buildings, reclaimed wood retains its unique character, offering rich textures and distinct visual elements. Its use in furniture, flooring, and accent walls provides not only an organic touch but also a story to tell, enhancing the warmth of any space. 

Bamboo, revered for its rapid growth and renewable properties, is another sustainable material gaining traction in interior design. It serves as a versatile option for flooring, furniture, and decorative elements. With its natural beauty and resilience, bamboo complements modern and traditional styles alike, making it an appealing choice for a range of applications within the home. 

Moreover, recycled metals are being increasingly utilised in the manufacturing of home fixtures and furnishings. Items crafted from recycled aluminium, stainless steel, and copper not only contribute to reducing waste but also deliver sleek, contemporary designs that can elevate the aesthetics of any interior. Their durability and low maintenance requirements add to their appeal as sustainable options. 

In essence, sustainable materials are revolutionising interior design by providing an array of aesthetically pleasing and environmentally friendly choices. The[ **best interior designers in Mumbai**](https://www.home2decor.com/) are embracing this sustainable design philosophy, seamlessly integrating materials like reclaimed wood, bamboo, and recycled metals into their projects. As design trends evolve, the integration of these eco-friendly materials underscores the commitment of consumers and designers alike to foster a harmonious relationship between their interiors and the planet. This shift not only augments visual interest but also promotes a sustainable future for the environment.

# Biophilic Design: Bringing Nature Indoors 

Biophilic design embodies the concept of integrating nature into interior spaces to create environments that enhance well-being and connection to the natural world. This design philosophy rests on the idea that incorporating elements such as plants, natural light, and water features can significantly improve physical and psychological health. In an era where urban living often distances individuals from nature, biophilic design serves as a bridge to restore this essential relationship. 

One key aspect of biophilic design is the strategic inclusion of plants within interior settings. Houseplants not only beautify spaces but also purify the air, increase humidity, and contribute to mental well-being. Designs that incorporate plant walls, hanging gardens, or even simple potted plants can transform an otherwise sterile environment into a vibrant sanctuary. Recent studies indicate that exposure to greenery can reduce stress levels and enhance cognitive function, making it a vital component of modern interior design. 

Natural light plays an equally important role in biophilic design. Maximising sunlight through large windows or skylights creates an uplifting atmosphere and promotes the body’s natural circadian rhythms. Spaces designed with consideration of light quality help improve mood and energy levels, making them more conducive for both work and relaxation. Moreover, water features such as fountains or aquariums introduce the calming sounds of flowing water, adding to the sensory experience of the space. 

Several successful examples of biophilic design can be observed in contemporary homes, where open floor plans seamlessly blend indoor and outdoor spaces. Homes that feature expansive glass doors that open onto gardens or patios exemplify how biophilic principles can create a fluid and interconnected living experience. These designs highlight the potential for harmony between architecture and nature, resulting in spaces that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also promote overall well-being. 

# Maximalism: Bold Patterns and Texture 

Maximalism in interior design is characterised by an abundance of colours, patterns, and textures, creating a space rich in personality and visual interest. Unlike its counterpart, minimalism, which emphasises simplicity and a ""less is more"" philosophy, maximalism embraces complexity and is often described as ""more is more."" This design trend encourages home decorators and designers to showcase their individuality through eclectic decor, combining various styles, periods, and influences. The [**Top 10 interior designers in Mumbai**](https://www.home2decor.com/) are championing this expressive approach, bringing a refined yet bold vision to homes that celebrate uniqueness and layered storytelling.

One of the defining features of maximalism is its use of vibrant colours. From deep jewel tones to bright pastels, maximalist spaces often feature a bold, saturated palette that makes a dramatic statement. Homeowners are encouraged to mix and match colours instead of adhering to traditional colour schemes. This creates a lively atmosphere that reflects personal tastes and encourages creativity. In addition to bold colours, maximalism incorporates layers of patterns—floral designs, geometric shapes, and animal prints all play a role in crafting a visually stimulating environment. 

Layered textures further enhance the maximalist aesthetic, adding depth and richness to spaces. Textiles such as velvet, silk, and burlap can be combined in a single room, producing an inviting and comfortable feel. Artwork, furniture, and decor items can also be blended to create a curated yet spontaneous look. Antique and modern pieces can coexist harmoniously, allowing for unique juxtapositions and inspiring arrangements. This fusion of styles not only allows for greater expression but also tells a story, as each element contributes to the overall narrative of the space. 

In fact, maximalism invites homeowners to be adventurous and embrace bolder design choices, transforming their interiors into vibrant reflections of their personalities. As we look ahead to 2025, this design trend continues to inspire and challenge conventional notions of decor, paving the way for a more personalised aesthetic in modern interiors. 

# Smart Home Integration: Technology Meets Design 

As we move toward 2025, the convergence of technology and interior design is becoming increasingly prominent, shaping spaces that are not only visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly. Smart home integration is set to revolutionise how we interact with our living environments, blending cutting-edge technology with sophisticated aesthetics. One of the key trends is the emergence of smart furniture, which combines contemporary design with advanced functionalities. Examples include sofas with built-in charging stations and tables that can be adjusted electronically to suit various needs, from dining to working. 

Moreover, automated systems will play a pivotal role in shaping interiors, enabling homeowners to control lighting, heating, and security with ease. Imagine entering a room where your lights automatically adjust to your preferred brightness or music begins playing based on your mood or time of day. Such integrations not only enhance comfort but also boost energy efficiency, a significant consideration for sustainable living. As these systems evolve, they are becoming more intuitive, making it easier for residents to customise their environments. 

Home assistants, like smart speakers, will also continue to gain traction, functioning as the nexus of interconnected devices throughout the house. They provide voice-controlled access to various technologies, streamlining daily routines. The integration of these home assistants into the overall design of a space is crucial, with brands increasingly offering aesthetically pleasing options that can blend seamlessly with decor rather than disrupt it. 

Ultimately, as we look toward 2025, the interplay of smart home technology and interior design will result in spaces that not only meet the demands of modern living but also reflect individual style. The aesthetic possibilities are vast, and as technology continues to advance, so too will our design choices. 

# Colour Trends for 2025: From Terracotta to Pastel Hues

As we approach 2025, colour trends are evolving to reflect a renewed appreciation for both nature and serenity within interior spaces. Among these anticipated trends, terracotta emerges as a deeply rooted shade that resonates with earthy tones and evokes a sense of warmth. This rich hue not only adds character but also seamlessly blends with a variety of decor styles, from rustic to contemporary. Incorporating terracotta into your home can be achieved through various means**,** such as accent walls, decorative pottery, or textiles, which serve as a foundation for creating a cohesive colour palette. 

Complementing terracotta, earthy tones such as muted greens, warm browns, and sandy beiges are anticipated to dominate the design landscape in 2025. These colours reflect a connection to the environment, promoting tranquillity and grounding energy within indoor spaces. To effectively incorporate these hues, consider layering different shades, utilising natural materials like wood and stone, and keeping accessories minimal yet impactful. This layering can enhance depth and visual interest while encouraging a harmonious ambience that resonates with wellness themes. 

Soft pastel hues are also making a significant comeback. Colours like blush pink, lavender, and airy blue are expected to add softness and lightness to interiors, offering a gentle contrast to bolder shades. These pastels create a serene atmosphere, making them ideal for bedrooms and living areas where relaxation is paramount. For successful integration, consider using pastels in combination with neutral backdrops, allowing the softness to become a focal point without overwhelming the space. Painting accents, using pastel furniture, or including pastel artwork can imbue a space with personality while maintaining a balanced aesthetic. 

In conclusion, the colour trends for 2025 emphasise an inclination towards natural and soothing tones, offering ample opportunities for creative expression within interior design. By thoughtfully incorporating terracotta, earthy tones, and soft pastels, homeowners can achieve a visually appealing and harmonious environment that reflects the beauty of nature and contemporary living. 

# Vintage Revival: Timeless Charm in Modern Interiors 

The resurgence of vintage-inspired decor in contemporary interiors is making a remarkable impact on design choices for 2025. As homeowners seek to blend nostalgia with functionality, vintage revival seamlessly incorporates elements reminiscent of bygone eras into modern living spaces. This design trend celebrates the charm of past decades while ensuring it meets the demands of today’s lifestyle. 

Essential furniture pieces are at the heart of this trend, embodying classic designs that evoke feelings of comfort and familiarity. Mid-century modern furniture, with its clean lines and organic shapes, continues to be a favoured choice, offering a perfect balance between aesthetics and practicality. Upholstered armchairs, reclaimed wooden tables, and ornate coffee tables can enhance any room, creating a captivating focal point while serving everyday functions. 

Colour palettes associated with vintage trends are equally significant. Soft pastels, rich jewel tones, and muted earth colours often evoke a sense of warmth and nostalgia. These hues can be effortlessly integrated into modern spaces through paint choices, wallpaper, and accessories. Additionally, vintage prints and patterns, such as florals and geometric designs, are being revived, adding character and vibrancy to otherwise minimalistic spaces. 

Design motifs also reflect the influence of past eras, from Art Deco flourishes to rustic farmhouse details. The juxtaposition of vintage accents alongside contemporary design elements creates a harmonious balance that not only honours historical aesthetics but also caters to modern sensibilities. Curating a space that merges timeless charm with current trends allows for personal expression while ensuring that homes remain functional and stylish.

In conclusion, the vintage revival trend suggests that incorporating elements from the past can lead to beautifully curated interiors that are both nostalgic and practical. By embracing vintage-inspired decor, homeowners can create unique living environments that tell a story while remaining firmly rooted in the present. 

# Multi-Functional Spaces: Adapting to Modern Lifestyles 

As urban living continues to evolve, the need for multi-functional spaces has become increasingly significant. In 2025, homeowners are increasingly prioritising versatility in their living environments. This trend reflects a shift towards spaces that can accommodate various activities, such as work, relaxation, and entertainment, all within a single room. Adapting to modern lifestyles requires thoughtful design that maximises efficiency while also enhancing comfort. 

One innovative approach to creating multi-functional spaces is the implementation of modular furniture. This type of furniture provides flexibility, allowing homeowners to rearrange their living areas according to their current needs. For instance, a sofa that converts into a guest bed or a coffee table that doubles as a workstation can help utilise limited square footage effectively. Using movable partitions or curtains can also delineate spaces, enabling users to create distinct areas without permanently altering the layout of the room. 

Moreover, the integration of technology plays a crucial role in the function of these versatile spaces. Smart home systems allow for seamless control of lighting, temperature, and multimedia from a single device, enhancing both comfort and convenience. By incorporating hidden storage solutions, such as under-bed drawers and built-in shelves, homeowners can maintain an organised environment tailored to their various day-to-day activities. 

Another significant factor influencing the design of multi-functional spaces is the demand for home offices due to the rise of remote work. Assessing the acoustics and natural lighting in a chosen area can ensure that workstations are conducive to productivity. Additionally, creating dedicated zones for work that can be easily transitioned back to leisure areas is crucial for maintaining a balanced lifestyle. Ultimately, as we move further into 2025, the emphasis on adaptable living environments will continue to shape the way we interact with our homes. 

# Personalisation: Customisation in Design 

The trend of personalisation in home décor has gained significant momentum in recent years, influenced by consumers' desires to express their individuality and lifestyle preferences through their living spaces. In 2025, this trend is projected to evolve further, emphasising customised furniture, DIY projects, and meaningful decor items as essential components of interior design. 

One of the most prominent aspects of this personalisation trend is the demand for customised furniture. Rather than opting for mass-produced items, consumers are increasingly turning to bespoke pieces that reflect their unique tastes. They seek everything from tailored sofas that match their colour schemes to handcrafted tables made from reclaimed wood. A[ **luxury interior designer in Mumbai**](https://www.home2decor.com/) often caters to this rising demand, curating personalised spaces that seamlessly combine functionality with refined, individual expression. This focus on customisation ensures that every piece not only serves a functional purpose but also evokes personal significance and aligns with the homeowner's overall design vision.

In tandem with traditionally customised furniture, DIY projects have also surged in popularity. Many homeowners have embarked on creative endeavours to craft their own decor items, allowing them to incorporate personal narratives into their spaces. Whether it is painting a piece of furniture to match a favourite colour or constructing wall art that reflects cherished memories, DIY endeavours enable individuals to make their homes distinctly theirs. 

Moreover, meaningful decor items—those that convey personal stories or hold sentimental value—are becoming increasingly prevalent in interior design. These items might include family heirlooms, travel mementoes, or artworks created by friends or family members. Integrating such personalised elements into a home not only enhances its visual appeal but also fosters a profound emotional connection between the inhabitants and their environment. 

*As consumers continue to seek personalised living spaces, the emphasis on customisation in design is expected to grow stronger, driving innovation and creativity in the world of interior decoration. This holistic approach ensures that homes not only function as shelters but also as authentic reflections of the people who inhabit them.*

1k9rv6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k9rv6f/upgrade_espresso_machine_and_or_grinder_2000/,Upgrade espresso machine and/ or grinder [£2000],"Hi all,

I know this has been discussed loads, but I’m bringing it up anyway 😂.

Recently discovered that my Gaggia (Evo 2023) suffered from boilergate (protective boiler coating flaking off). I am getting a replacement boiler through Gaggia but it made me think about upgrading my setup.

I have maintained my machine well, over 2 years and it pulls decent shots but of course I have been toying with dual boilers and better HX machines etc. I would love better temp stability with a PID, pressure gauge etc. I have also been toying with the gagguino and gaggimate as a cheaper way to upgrade.

BUT have I been missing the most important upgrade? My grinder.

Right now I hand grind using the Knock Feld 47 which I actually think is a decent grinder but I know there is a plethora of much better options. I wouldn’t be looking to spend more than say £800 and preferably cheaper unless something was gonna make a mind blowing difference.

Any advice welcome. What would your priorities be?

Side note: I make 2 to 3 coffees a day, usually milk based but very rarely back to back. I’d also be willing to spend around £2000 overall. Of course, the less I need to spend the better.

1k9rtso,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostmedia/comments/1k9rtso/a_hard_one_anyone_remember_a_show_that_may_have/,A hard one: Anyone remember a show that may have only existed on Winamp TV? [fully lost],"Winamp TV was a too-soon-for-it's-time service attached to Winamp. Winamp, of course, were the pioneers of internet radio with their Shoutcast technology, and tried to extend that to video in the mid 2000's with Winamp TV. This was YEARS before basically any other streaming technology came online. Before Twitch, probably even before JustinTV, or Stickam. Before all of it. 

It was mostly what you'd expect: a lot of piracy. There were tons of user-hosted channels dedicated to running one show in massive marathons: 24/7 Seinfeld, 24/7 Simpsons, 24/7 South Park, and even 24/7 pornography. 

But there were some channels legitimately dedicated to treating Winamp TV like public access. People would operate ""channels"" of their own content, sometimes a real live show, sometimes just running something pre-recorded. And there was one channel in particular that captivated me for just how unusual it was. 

I do not remember the man's name. He was kind of husky. Reminded me of Steve Harwell of Smash Mouth. I believe he wore a trench coat, combat boots and wrap around sunglasses. The style at the time.

He referred to himself as a ""wog."" Now, that's a British slur, but this man was American, and white. I don't think he knew it was a British slur. He said it defined his lifestyle; I believe he said it was something samurai related. He thought of himself as sort of a ronin probably more specifically. A wanderer that exists to help people. 

A more practical perspective is that he was a survivalist that was very anti-establishment. His channel ran 24/7, full of videos he himself produced. It was a lot of him on camera espousing his way of living. He had simple tips for getting through your day; things like slipping a coffee bean under your tongue for an hours-long drip feed of caffeine. He talked about his gear, about shopping exclusively from a military surplus store because everything they sold was (at the time) cheap and durable. He talked about his hatred of branding and marketing, about how if he bought anything with a corporate logo on it, he would do everything in his power to get rid of it. He did not want to advertise for anyone on his body. 

He talked about how he lived to help people. He seemed weird and abrasive but like there was probably a nice guy under there somewhere. Not malicious, just intense. I think he may have mentioned once that he worked in IT to pay his bills but otherwise was kind of disconnected from the main stream, outside of his stated goal of helping people in need. I could never quite get a bead on whether he had the potential to be dangerous, but when he said ""help,"" he seemed to mean it genuinely.

The bulk of his Winamp TV channel was a very long series of videos he produced about his one (and only?) trip to visit Burning Man. This was 2004, 2005, up to maybe 2007 at the latest. This was the first time I'd ever heard of Burning Man, and this dude had anywhere from 3 to 8 hours of Burning Man content, with his survival guide/lifestyle/manifesto stuff sandwiched between at the rerun loop point. 

I was in my mid 20's when I saw all this stuff and I was fascinated. It was so unusual. So unlike anything I'd seen at the time. Both from the perspective of seeing Burning Man for the first time and seeing this man and his chosen lifestyle.

But I got bored of Winamp TV. Connection quality wasn't great on most live channels, the software was buggy and getting bloated, and I got tired of gawking at this dude. 

But he's stuck out as the most unique, interesting memory about Winamp TV. The problem is, true to this dude's anti-establishment wanderer life style, he's disappeared off the face of the planet. I cannot find any evidence of his show anywhere online. Not his name, not anything connected to his definition of ""wog,"" and with so much (now vintage) Burning Man video, you'd think it'd be archived somewhere and it just isn't. 

It's to the point where it almost feels like a dream. I've never heard another human being talk about this man before. If nothing else, I just want to know what happened to him.",11,1745834473.0,lostmedia,2,1.0,False

I barely get any sleep, the outpost is basically a small FOB for small strike teams, and worst of all, we have Humans. 

The morning call is along the lines of ""The horrors of war continue to persist, under Federation Mercy""

The Human who sleeps next to me is still asleep despite the constant mortaring, even so far as to make a shrapnel proof cocoon made out of ballistic blankets and a helmet. 

The human on the other side is already making coffee the way both of us like it, SCALDING HOT AND BLACK. 

My human officer is reading the morning schedule like it's a fucking TSA back on our homeworld, which I take comfort in. 

Mess hall is serving half-decent chow, at least the noodles were al dente and the military dumplings had more meat than potatoes inside. 

The runny eggs are good, surprisingly. 

The CO of the outpost just walked past me, almost saluted him until my friend punched me in the shoulder and reminded me WHY WE DON'T DO THAT. 

and now a bunch of green faced cadets, sadly none are human, are arriving and I still have 4 more months of this. 

by the goddess' breast milk, let the war end, I want humans to just pop into the enemy base and blow it up....and considering we are all forbidden from entering the command tent...that might come sooner.

I'm looking to purchase a DF64 very soon to replace my Sage SGP and I'm struggling to decide on the burr set to buy with the grinder.

I'm not interested in switching out burr sets regularly, so ideally I'd like to get a set which will accommodate my (possibly unrealistic) needs.

I mostly drink espresso-based drinks, but I do enjoy the odd v60 pour-over. I know this grinder is normally recommended by pour-over fans but I'd read that it's also good for espresso. I'm probably at about an 80% espresso, 20% pour-over split.

I enjoy some body in my coffee, so my conical burr SGP has been reasonable up until now, but I'm interested in exploring more flavours available in coffee so want a better grinder to help with this. I don't think I want total tea-like clarity as I'd hate to totally lose the body.

With all that being said, what would be a good recommendation for the burrs to buy fitted to this grinder that will still give some body, but also better clarity than my SGP? Some of the UK resellers I've looked at offer pre-installed stainless, DLC, SSP etc.

Any thoughts?

Thanks!",1,1745834336.0,DF64,2,1.0,False

""Ms. Dorsey, your resignation formalities have already been approved by Mr. Meyers, but he didn’t realize that it was you who resigned. Should I remind him?""

Upon hearing the news over the phone, Nathalie Dorsey slowly lowered her gaze and said, ""No need, that’s enough.""

""But you worked as Mr. Meyers’ secretary for four years, and he was very pleased with your work. Are you really sure about leaving?""

HR earnestly advised, but Nathalie just smiled and responded, ""No one is irreplaceable. My parents have been unwell, and it’s time for me to focus on them. Plus, I've decided it's time for a change. I will leave in a month, following the process. Thank you for understanding.""

After the phone call ended, Nathalie continued to pack up her belongings.

She had lived in this villa for three years, with just the right amount of things to feel at home. As she slowly emptied the space, memories of her time here flooded back, bittersweet but with a sense of finality.

Eight years ago, Nathalie, a girl from a modest background, was accepted into Galwiea University. There, she became best friends with Angelica Meyers, the heiress of the renowned Meyers family.

The two girls, from vastly different backgrounds, became inseparable. They shared everything—attending classes together, having meals, and shopping. Slowly, Nathalie found herself welcomed into Angelica’s family circle, where she also met Angelica’s brother, Jordon Meyers. Nathalie developed feelings for Jordon, but she kept them hidden, not daring to express them.

After graduation, Angelica went abroad to continue her studies. Nathalie, however, stayed in Galwiea and submitted her resume to work as Jordon's secretary, hoping it would bring her closer to him.

Then, one night, an unfortunate incident occurred: Jordon was [insensible](https://dxwicw3mziu.feishu.cn/wiki/TYdlwJfPsiutwUkxfmfcQ8WKnfb?sheet=082c2d#/#), and when Nathalie came to his aid, things took an unexpected turn. They spent the night together, and in the morning, Jordon sat by the window, deep in thought. He turned to her and asked quietly, ""Do you like me?""

Nathalie was startled and, instinctively, tried to deny it. But Jordon pointed out the signs—how she would blush when near him, how she always remembered his preferences, how she had become his secretary just to be closer to him.

His words made her face flush with embarrassment and guilt, but before she could respond, Jordon handed her a card and said, ""Last night was unexpected. I have feelings for someone else and cannot return your affection. I know your family background isn’t wealthy, but you have enough to live comfortably. I think you should forget about this.""

Nathalie was stunned and, in that moment, realized that Jordon’s love still belonged to Emilee Collier, his first love. Despite the years that had passed, Jordon remained loyal to Emilee, waiting for her to return, even though she had long moved on. Nathalie understood the depth of his feelings, and though it hurt, she knew she could never compete with his memories of Emilee.

A few days ago, Nathalie had tried to surprise him for his birthday, hoping to rekindle something, but when she opened her phone, she saw a post from Jordon on Instagram—a photo of him kissing Emilee under fireworks. The caption read, ""The best birthday gift is to lose and regain.""

The sight of this photo shattered her. She called Jordon, but it was Emilee who answered. After a few moments of silence, Jordon's faint voice came through, ""She's just someone from the past. Don't worry about it.""

That was when Nathalie knew it was time to leave.

She began to pack, knowing that staying would only bring more pain. As she made her way out of the villa, she ran into Jordon at the door. Seeing her hold her belongings, he gave her a brief look but didn’t try to stop her. ""Did you find a new place?"" he asked.

""Yes, it's the same rental I used before. I spoke to the landlord and arranged to stay for a month,"" she replied.

Jordon raised an eyebrow. ""One month? Why?""

Nathalie was about to explain but paused when she saw his lack of interest. ""I’ll take you there,"" he said, his voice low.

Although she initially wanted to refuse, Jordon insisted. ""It’s late, and the snow is heavy. If anything happens to you, Angelica will be upset.""

Reluctantly, Nathalie agreed and got in the car. The once-familiar interior of the car now seemed strange, filled with cute dolls and snacks, a reminder of Emilee's influence on Jordon.

Noticing her gaze, Jordon said quietly, ""Emilee liked these.""

Nathalie nodded, feeling a pang in her thorax but keeping her emotions in check. ""I’m happy for you, Jordon,"" she said softly, her voice tinged with sadness.

Jordon didn’t respond, his attention on the road as he drove. Halfway there, his phone rang. It was Emilee, asking him to build a snowman with her. He pulled over and hesitated, then looked at Nathalie.

""Go ahead,"" she said, sensing his dilemma. ""I’ll take a cab.""

Jordon nodded and got out of the car to help her with her things. As they were unloading, Nathalie’s box slipped from her hands, scattering some items onto the cold ground. As Jordon bent down to help, his eyes fell on the scattered contents—photos of him, love letters never sent, and mementos she had kept in secret.

For a moment, they both froze. Nathalie quickly gathered the items, but Jordon’s gaze lingered on her for a brief second before he turned away and got back into the car, driving off without another word.

Nathalie stood in the snow for a long time, waiting for a taxi, but none came. She tried to walk home, clutching her box, but was knocked over by an electric bike. Her calf was scraped badly, and blood stained the snow. She lay there for a while, dazed and in pain, before she managed to get up.

After several hours, Nathalie finally made it back to her rented apartment. She treated her wound and checked her phone. Jordon had sent her a message: ""Don't invest too much in one person. There are plenty of other people out there.""

She stared at the message for a long time, and for the first time, she felt her feeling let go.

The next morning, she took the box of old memories and kindled it in the yard, letting go of everything that had tied her to Jordon. The ashes were all that remained of a past she had to leave behind.





**Chapter 2**

Nathalie took a couple of days off over the weekend to rest, and on Monday, she returned to work as usual. She calmly handled the tasks in front of her, making sure to update Jordon about the meeting scheduled for that afternoon.

When she entered the office, she noticed Emilee sitting in Jordon's office, speaking with him. She was smiling, and Jordon appeared relaxed, something that made Nathalie pause for a moment before knocking on the door to announce the meeting.

""Mr. Meyers, the meeting is about to start,"" she said in a professional tone.

Jordon, momentarily distracted by Emilee, glanced at Nathalie before nodding. ""Thanks, Nathalie. I’ll be right there.""

As Jordon started to get up, Emilee gently pulled him back. ""I know you're busy, but can you stay for just a few more minutes? I really enjoy spending time with you.""

Jordon gave her a soft smile, and it was clear that he was torn between his personal and professional life. After a brief moment of hesitation, he sighed and spoke. ""The meeting will be delayed by just a bit. This is important.""

Nathalie left the office, trying not to let the disappointment show on her face. She understood the importance of the upcoming collaboration meeting, but seeing Jordon so easily postponing it for personal reasons made her question his priorities.

Minutes passed as she prepared herself to enter the conference room. She knew how important the CEOs of the Alvarez Group, the Webb Group, and the Rodgers Group were to the company's future. But the delay was inevitable, and she would have to explain the situation to the directors.

When the meeting finally began, Nathalie's tension was palpable. She had been dealing with the pressure of managing the situation on her own. The Meyers family’s reputation had always been impeccable, but today, their decision to delay a major meeting for such a personal reason left the others frustrated.

Despite the tension, Nathalie kept her composure. She respected her position and had to remain professional. When Jordon finally arrived, two hours late, she noticed the discomfort of the other executives. They were clearly unhappy with the delay, but Nathalie simply bowed her head and apologized.

""Mr. Meyers, the situation has been explained. The meeting is ready to proceed,"" Nathalie said, trying to smooth things over.

Jordon glanced at her, still a little distracted. His eyes softened slightly. ""Thank you, Nathalie. I appreciate your patience.""

Later that day, Emilee approached Nathalie in the break room, her expression warm but with a hint of entitlement. ""Are you Nathalie? Jordon mentioned you're great at making coffee. Could you please prepare some for everyone, including a cold brew for me, with no sugar?""

Nathalie hesitated but nodded, knowing it was part of her duties. She took a deep breath and started preparing the coffee.

It took her a while, but she made sure every cup was just right. Emilee took the first sip and smiled. ""This is perfect! Thank you, Nathalie."" She seemed satisfied, but it was clear that her words were simply another expectation placed on Nathalie without a word of genuine appreciation.

However, Emilee’s next request was even more demanding. ""I need more coffee,"" she said dismissively, as though it were Nathalie's sole responsibility to meet her needs.

Nathalie felt the exhaustion weigh on her but didn't let it show. She quietly prepared more coffee, making sure it was done well.

As she handed out the cups, Emilee continued to direct her requests without much thought for the strain it placed on Nathalie. At one point, Nathalie felt her energy draining, but she remained professional and courteous.

In the meantime, Jordon came out of his office to check on the situation. Seeing Emilee sitting comfortably and Nathalie still working diligently, he paused for a moment.

""Nathalie, I see you’re handling things well, but don’t overwork yourself. Take a break if you need one,"" Jordon said with a tone of concern.

Nathalie offered him a small smile, grateful for the acknowledgment. ""Thank you, Mr. Meyers. I’m fine.""

While Emilee was grateful for the coffee, she seemed to forget her manners, not offering thanks or showing any appreciation. Nathalie sighed quietly to herself. She had long learned that, in her position, there would be moments where she’d go unnoticed or unappreciated. But it was her duty, and she accepted it.

As the day wore on, Nathalie focused on her work, managing her responsibilities with grace and professionalism. She knew the path she had chosen would often be difficult, but she had learned to navigate these challenges with patience, never letting her emotions cloud her judgment.

By the end of the day, the meeting had concluded, and everything had gone smoothly. Nathalie returned to her desk and took a deep breath. Another day had passed, and while she still had a long way to go, she knew she could handle whatever came next.







**Chapter 3**

Nathalie watched as Jordon’s figure disappeared around the corner, and for the first time in a long while, she allowed herself to feel the weight of everything that had happened. The tears she had held back for so long finally fell, but she wiped them away quickly, not wanting anyone to see her weakness. She gathered her strength, got up from her desk, and began cleaning the mess left behind after the meeting.

Some kind colleagues noticed her working alone and quietly came over to offer their help.

""Nathalie, are you okay? I heard Emilee asked for something specific, but she seemed upset when things didn't go exactly as she wanted.""

""I've heard people say that Emilee can be a bit... demanding,"" one colleague added, looking around cautiously. ""I know she’s important to Mr. Meyers, but we should still try to stay professional.""

Nathalie nodded, grateful for their kindness. She had never really felt fully accepted in the workplace, and it hurt to hear others express concerns about the way Emilee treated her. But at the same time, she couldn’t deny the reality of the situation.

Once, Nathalie had managed a contract that had gone awry through no fault of her own, but when the issue was raised, Jordon stood by her, making sure her name was cleared. She had always trusted his judgment, but now it seemed as though Emilee could do no wrong in his eyes. Her own struggles felt invisible in comparison.

Nathalie finished cleaning, her body aching from the long day. She headed home, but just as she was about to relax, she received another call from Jordon.

""Can you send some warm milk over? I’ll need a few other things as well,"" he said, his voice calm and distant.

Nathalie sighed, nodded, and quickly gathered the items before driving to Jordon’s villa. It had been a few days since she’d seen the house, and she noticed immediately that it had changed. The once simple, elegant design was now filled with pastel colors and decorations that seemed more suited to Emilee's tastes.

When she entered, the air felt different—distant. She knocked on the bedroom door, and Jordon answered, only giving her a brief glance before reaching for the items she brought.

He froze when he saw her face, still marked by the injuries from earlier. ""You should really get those checked out,"" he said, concern crossing his face. ""Emilee wasn’t trying to hurt you. She was just feeling unwell. Don't let it bother you.""

Nathalie shook her head, her lips pressed into a thin line. She had heard these words before. Emilee’s behavior always seemed to be excused, and Nathalie’s own feelings and injuries were pushed aside.

Jordon handed her a card. ""I know things have been tough, but you’ll get your salary adjusted with your year-end bonus. Take care of yourself, Nathalie.""

She nodded silently, her throat tight with unsaid words. She didn’t know how to tell him that she was thinking of resigning, of walking away from this situation that seemed to only get more complicated and painful.

As she turned to leave, she heard Emilee’s voice, soft and insistent, coming from the next room.

""Jordon, can you please heat up the milk? And can you help with my back?"" she asked, her tone demanding yet sweet.

Nathalie paused for a moment at the door, her mood heavy. She had once suffered from severe menstrual pain, and on those days, when she had needed Jordon the most, he had never been there. Yet Emilee’s needs were always a priority.

She forced herself to smile, though it was more of a bitter twist of her lips. Walking away from the villa, Nathalie felt the weight of the moment settle in. She had tried so hard to be good at her job, to be loyal, but it seemed like she was always second to someone else’s needs and desires.

The next few days passed in a blur of work. The party preparations for Emilee’s welcome banquet were detailed and demanding, but Nathalie threw herself into the task, focusing on the little things to make sure everything went smoothly. She worked tirelessly to ensure that every detail, from the flowers to the desserts, was perfect.

When the evening of the banquet arrived, Emilee entered the room, shining in a couture gown that drew all eyes to her. The guests crowded around her, offering compliments and praises, as she basked in the attention.

""Ms. Collier looks stunning as always. It’s clear that Mr. Meyers cares for her deeply,"" one guest remarked.

Nathalie watched from the sidelines, her mood heavy with the knowledge that Jordon’s affection was always on display for Emilee, while she was left in the shadows.

""Did you hear about how Mr. Meyers protected Emilee in school?"" another guest whispered. ""He even forced someone to transfer when they confessed their feelings for her.""

Nathalie clenched her fists. She had heard these stories before. It seemed like Emilee was untouchable in Jordon’s eyes, and no matter how much Nathalie tried, she could never reach that level of care or attention.

[[Browse top-rated espresso martini candle on Amazon]](https://petsknows.com/hot-selling-items/?kw=espresso+martini+candle)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The Espresso Martini Candle boasts several impressive features that contribute to its overall appeal and sensory experience.

**Fragrance Blend:** The candle features a meticulously crafted fragrance blend designed to mimic the complex scent profile of an espresso martini. This includes top notes of freshly ground coffee beans, a heart of sweet vanilla and coffee liqueur, and a base of smooth vodka and a hint of chocolate. The proportions are carefully balanced to avoid any one scent overpowering the others, resulting in a nuanced and realistic aroma.

The intricate blend is achieved through the use of both natural essential oils and synthetic fragrance compounds, ensuring both authenticity and longevity. The coffee bean notes are derived from real coffee extract, providing a depth of aroma that cannot be replicated with purely synthetic ingredients. The vanilla and coffee liqueur notes add a layer of sweetness and warmth, while the vodka base provides a subtle alcoholic edge that completes the experience.

**Wax Composition:** The candle is made from a blend of soy wax and beeswax. This combination offers several advantages over traditional paraffin wax. Soy wax is derived from soybeans, making it a renewable resource and a more environmentally friendly option. It also burns cleaner than paraffin wax, producing less soot and smoke. Beeswax, on the other hand, provides a natural sweetness and helps to improve the burn time and scent throw of the candle.

The specific ratio of soy wax to beeswax is carefully calibrated to optimize performance. Too much soy wax can result in a soft candle that melts too quickly, while too much beeswax can make the candle difficult to light and burn unevenly. The ideal balance ensures a long-lasting, clean-burning candle with a strong and consistent scent throw.

**Burn Time:** The Espresso Martini Candle has an impressive burn time of approximately 50-60 hours. This allows for extended enjoyment of the fragrance without the need for frequent replacements. The extended burn time is achieved through a combination of high-quality wax, a properly sized wick, and careful manufacturing processes.

The wick is made from 100% cotton and is specifically chosen to complement the wax blend. A wick that is too small will not produce enough heat to melt the wax properly, resulting in a weak scent throw. A wick that is too large will produce too much heat, causing the candle to burn too quickly and potentially create soot or smoke. The correct wick size ensures a balanced and efficient burn.

**Container Design:** The candle is housed in a sleek and stylish glass container. The container is designed not only to be aesthetically pleasing but also to protect the surrounding surfaces from heat and wax spills. The glass is thick and durable, providing a safe and stable base for the candle.

The container's design is minimalist, with a clean and modern look that complements any decor. The label features a subtle and elegant design that reflects the sophistication of the espresso martini cocktail. The container is also reusable, allowing users to repurpose it after the candle has been burned.

Key features of the Espresso Martini Candle include:

*   Authentic Espresso Martini Scent
*   Soy and Beeswax Blend
*   Long Burn Time (50-60 hours)
*   Elegant Glass Container

 ## Core Benefits

The Espresso Martini Candle offers several core benefits that make it a desirable addition to any home.

**Enhanced Atmosphere:** The candle creates a warm and inviting atmosphere that is perfect for relaxation, entertaining, or simply unwinding after a long day. The unique scent of espresso martini evokes feelings of comfort, sophistication, and indulgence, transforming any space into a cozy and welcoming environment.

The subtle sweetness of the vanilla and coffee liqueur notes adds a touch of warmth and comfort, while the hint of vodka provides a stimulating and invigorating element. The overall effect is a balanced and harmonious fragrance that enhances the ambiance of any room.

**Stress Relief:** The aroma of the Espresso Martini Candle can help to reduce stress and promote relaxation. The familiar scent of coffee is known to have calming effects, while the sweet notes of vanilla and coffee liqueur can uplift the mood and ease tension.

The candle's soft glow also contributes to its stress-relieving properties. The gentle light creates a sense of tranquility and peace, helping to quiet the mind and promote relaxation. Lighting the candle during meditation or yoga practice can further enhance its stress-reducing benefits.

**Odor Neutralization:** The candle can effectively neutralize unwanted odors in the home. The strong and complex fragrance of espresso martini can mask or eliminate a variety of unpleasant smells, such as cooking odors, pet odors, or musty smells.

Unlike many air fresheners that simply cover up odors with artificial scents, the Espresso Martini Candle actually helps to neutralize them. The natural ingredients in the wax and fragrance blend work to absorb and break down odor molecules, leaving the air smelling fresh and clean.

 ## FAQs Section

**Is the Espresso Martini Candle safe to burn around pets?**

Yes, when burned responsibly, the Espresso Martini Candle is generally safe to burn around pets. However, it's essential to ensure the candle is placed in a well-ventilated area away from drafts and flammable materials. Never leave a burning candle unattended, and always supervise pets around open flames. Some pets may be more sensitive to certain scents, so monitor your pet's behavior when the candle is lit.

**How can I maximize the burn time of the candle?**

To maximize the burn time of your Espresso Martini Candle, allow the candle to burn for at least 2-3 hours during the first use, or until the entire surface of the wax has melted. This prevents tunneling, where the candle burns down the center and leaves wax clinging to the sides. Trim the wick to 1/4 inch before each use to prevent smoking and ensure a clean burn. Avoid burning the candle for more than 4 hours at a time.

**Will the candle's scent fill a large room?**

The Espresso Martini Candle has a strong scent throw and is capable of filling a medium-sized room with its fragrance. For larger rooms, you may need to use multiple candles to achieve the desired scent intensity. The scent throw will also depend on factors such as air circulation and room temperature.

    - **Burn Time:** 40-50 hours
    - **Container Design:** Standard jar

Not gonna lie, I just kinda want someone to talk to tonight. Nothing serious, nothing romantic — just looking for a friend who’s down for some real convo (and maybe a little trauma dump if you’re okay with it).

Had a virtual inuman last night with a stranger, and honestly, it helped. But there’s still a lot sitting heavy in me, and it would be nice to have someone to talk to again.

I’ve been writing letters every day for someone I love — it’s supposed to be healing, but some days just hit differently, you know?

I’ll be free around 11PM later (got errands before that) and need to stay awake the whole night anyway because of my night shift tomorrow.
If you’re up for it, maybe we can grab dinner or chill at a coffee shop? If not, totally fine — chatting online works too!

If you’re also just vibing through life tonight, hit me up. Would be nice to not feel so heavy alone.

Hope your day’s been kinder than mine!

---

""Night Shift Hero""

The clock on the wall blinked 2:47 AM — the dead hour of the night. Most of the city slept, but Adam Reyes, senior security guard at Silverpoint Tech Industries, was wide awake, pacing the dimly lit halls.

Silverpoint wasn’t just any office — it was a fortress of cutting-edge technology, home to sensitive prototypes worth millions. Adam took his job seriously. After all, security wasn’t just a title — it was a responsibility.

As he sipped lukewarm coffee, the monitors in the security office flickered. For a second, every screen glitched — then came back. Adam froze, the cup halfway to his lips. That’s not normal.

A shadow moved across Camera 4 — the R&D wing.

He set the cup down quietly and tapped his earpiece.
“Dispatch, this is Reyes. Possible breach. Investigating R&D wing.”

No answer. Static hissed in his ear.

Alright, Adam, he thought, looks like you’re on your own.

He grabbed his flashlight and sidearm, moving silently down the hall. His boots barely made a sound on the polished floors as he approached the R&D section. The security door, usually sealed tight, was pried open — a thin wedge of metal still jammed in the frame.

A cold prickle ran down his spine. He edged through the door and scanned the corridor.

Movement — left side. Fast.

Adam pivoted, flashlight beam cutting through the darkness, catching a glimpse of a figure dressed in black, sprinting with a heavy satchel. Thief!
Without hesitation, Adam charged after him.

The intruder bolted down the hall, but Adam was faster than he looked. His time in the military taught him how to move under pressure. He closed the distance, heart hammering in his chest.

The thief swung around, tossing a flashbang grenade. Adam recognized it immediately — training kicked in.
He spun around and shielded his eyes just before the grenade detonated with a blinding flash and sharp crack.

Still dazed, Adam pushed forward. His ears rang, but he didn’t stop. He saw the thief reaching a side exit — an escape route!

Not on my watch.

He tackled the intruder just as the man shoved the door open, slamming them both onto the concrete outside. They wrestled, rolling over rough gravel. The thief pulled a knife, slashing wildly, but Adam grabbed his wrist and twisted hard. The blade clattered away.

“Give it up!” Adam growled, locking the thief’s arms behind his back.

Sirens wailed in the distance — backup was finally on the way.

The man struggled, but Adam pressed him into the ground until he gave up, panting heavily. When the squad cars finally rolled up, red and blue lights flashing against the walls, Adam rose, hauling the would-be saboteur to his feet.

Lieutenant Morris from local law enforcement stepped out of the cruiser, eyebrows raised.
“Reyes... one-man army tonight, huh?”

Adam chuckled, wiping sweat from his brow.
“Just doing my job, sir.”

Morris clapped him on the shoulder.
“Remind me never to try sneaking past you.”

As they loaded the thief into the back of the car, Adam looked up at the stars overhead, feeling the adrenaline finally ebb. Another quiet night... shattered, but restored.

And when the city slept, he’d still be here — ready.

I'll share below our itinerary from August 2022 that we absolutely loved. Hopefully it will also give some inspiration for those looking to go beyond Seoul-Busan. Our favorite part of the trip was the roadtrip, we are still thinking about it dearly. Driving in Korea was pretty easy, but again we were not driving in big cities. Overall we really much enjoyed Korean countryside and little seaside villages, and wish to explore more. We definitely want to hike again Korean mountains and maybe this time hike Jirisan ? or Seoraksan ? I'm taking all advices, considering we would like to not redo the same things too much. We plan to go next year around May-June for around 20 days. What should we enjoy in late spring ? Where do you recommend to go out of the beaten path ? Many thanks for those who will take time to read :-) 

**August 10th, Arrival day**  
Landed in Incheon, we took an express bus to Gangjin where we joined our friend in the evening 

**August 11th, Ferry to Jeju**   
Our friend's aunt drove us to Wando in the morning, we walked around the port and had lunch (some abalones, yum!) and took the afternoon ferry to Jeju. Went to the Dongmun night market to grab something to eat. 

**August 12th to August 14th, Jeju**  
We stayed with my friend in Jeju city. One day we went to Hyeopjae Beach and spent the day there / One day we hiked Hallasan to the summit (it was crazy hot for hiking but we managed and it was beautiful)/ last day we rented a car to go to Seogwipo and Seongsan Ilchubong. But we were so tired of the hike, we didnt really make the most of this last day in Jeju :-( 

**August 15th, Start of the roadrip in Jeollanam**  
We flew to Gimhae airport, my friend went her way and we took a rental car for 8 days. First stop was a camping ware store to buy a small tent and gear we didn't take with us. But it was summer so, not a lot needed to keep us warm haha.   
We drove to Tongyeong, went up with the cable car to catch the view, then drove to Namhae and find a spot for our tent by a 7-11 and a small beach. 

**August 16th, Namhae**  
Woke up early, the first night was so hot and windy, we didnt sleep much. We went to Daraegi Village, then to Boriam Temple and then had lunch in a samgyetang restaurant in Namhae-Eup.   
We drove to Suncheon Drama Filming and it was really cool to visit. It was pouring rain at this point though, so we had to take a last minute hotel room in Suncheon. Went to eat jeon and drink magkeolli though, so the rain was worth it haha.   
  
**August 17th, Suncheon Bay and Nagan Eupseong Village**   
Visited Suncheon Bay Reserve all morning, walked to Yongsan Obersatory. Was really fun to observe all the small crabs and jumping fishes. Views were incredible, even though the weather was really cloudy still. Went to bbq in a bamboo grove for lunch (restaurant name = Daesupgol Nongwon, bit pricey, not that memorable). We visited Nagan Eupseong Folk Village in the afternoon, so so pretty. The weather cleared up, it was stunning beautiful. The lotus were in bloom, a grandpa was selling ice cream and sikhye. Core memory. We find a spot for our tent in the evening at Yulpo-ri.   
  
**August 18th, Yulpo-ri and Boseong Green tea fields**   
We woke up and met with our camping neighbour, a Korean ahjussi who was fluent in English and French enthusiast. He was really willing to show us around so we spent the morning together, and drank so-maek so early in the morning lol. We had a early lunch together in a Chinese place, jjampong and tangsuyuk. Felt so full, went back to the camping, took a dip in the sea that was so warmmmm. Then we said goodbye and drove to Boseong to visit the green tea field, a really beautiful place, really soothing in the heat. Had a green tea ice cream treat. Then we drove to Hadong and found a camping ground for the night.   
  
**August 19th, Hadong-gun**  
Our original plan was to hike a part of Jirisan, but we were still physically inapt from the Hallasan summit hike, our legs were so sore. Waiting for my partner to complete his shower, one of the almeoni taking care of the camping grounds offered me some instant coffee. In the morning we visited Hwaeomsa temple. The grounds are beautiful, we had some snacks as well (yakghwa). We stopped by a market and bought some dried mountains veggies and herbs to take back home - it's impossible to find in France. Then went back to Hadong-gun, had a green tea duck bbq with potatoes lunch that was divine and unlike anything I had eaten before in Korean cooking. At the end they gave you bookeumbap to finish up. We enjoyed some tea at Maeamje Dawon and then hit the road to the east coast, north of Pohang.   
  
**August 20th, Yangdong Village and beach fireworks**  
After these sunny days, the rain came back. But our tent was safe under trees in a free camping spot next to a beach. We left to visit Yangdong village which we appreciated but was full of mosquitoes attacking visitors hahaha. Suddenly the rain started and the mosquitoes disappeared but we had to take shelter. One ahjussi living there saw us and invited us inside, offered us a drink and we felt so lucky to hear his life story, get a visit of one of house, sit with him on the wooden terrace. Going back to the camping we met with our neighbours, 2 twenty-something girl and boy staying the night with their dad. They were launching fireworks. Seeing us watching them they offered us to try with them. We shared snacks, played a card game, discussed French soccer. It was our last night of camping so in the morning we offered them our pink tent and gear, otherwise we would have to been able to take them back with us, so it was perfect for everyone. Really grateful for all the people who showed us kindness along this roadtrip, we felt so lucky for all these encounters.   
  
**August 21st, Hike and templestay**  
In the morning we did a small hike on Naeyeonsan 12 waterfalls path. We were with Korean elderly clubs lol it was really packed and they were way faster than us. We had a mountain veggies bibimbap that was delishhhh before hitting the road to Golgulsa temple where we booked a temple stay. We got introduced to some martial arts, ate temple cuisine, got introduced to the history of the place. 

**August 22nd, Gyeongju**   
In the morning we were able to participate to the morning prayer with the monks and see a stunning sunrise in the mountains. We felt really welcome, we recommend it to everyone. On our way to Gyeongju we visited Bulguksa temple. The evening in Gyeongju was stunning, the grounds of the park with flowers everywhere, the river, the bridge, at sunset... we were emotional. 

**August 23rd, Back to Busan and Gamcheon Village**   
We went back to airport to leave the car :-( and visited Gamcheon in the afternoon. We found a really cool DJ-listening bar by chance  and met some people who were so nice! We promised to be back to party!

**August 24th, Jagalchi, movies museum and Spa Land**  
We stayed in Busan 4 days. The first day was really gloomy so we decided to rest. We went to Jagalchi and ate a full plate of hoe, then stroll the book street and decided to go the movies museum (nice but skippable if you're short on time). Then we went to SPA Land. Best decision ever. 

**August 25th, Huinnyeoul and Gwangalli**   
The sun was back, we explored Huinnyeoul Culture Village, ate streetfood in Bupyeong market, then went to Gwangalli Beach. We watched the sunset in Millak Waterside park with some beers and had a dwaeji gukbap for dinner. Perfect day. 

**August 26th, Igidae walk**   
We hiked (yes!) Busan coast between Oryukdo and Igidae. The views were incredible, it was a really clear day. Our favorite activity in Busan. We ate a spicy daegutang in a small restaurant, very yum and we grabbed a patbingsu after. A friend travelling in Busan joined us at this point, we went back to Jagalchi with him and then did noraeabang and finished the night drinking soju and fish cakes at a pocha. 

**August 27th, Haedong Yonggunsa and night out**   
With our friend we visited the temple by the sea, ate milmyeon, took the train at Mipo around sunset time, grab bbq near Gwangalli. Then we went back together to the bar where we met with the same guys from the first night and went out to the Output. Lol. Very drunky night. 

**August 28th to September 5th, Seoul**   
We stayed 9 days in Seoul, which could seem like a long time but we were never bored and also we needed this time to catch up with local friends. We stayed in Usangil for 3 nights (I heard the area is getting demolished though...) and then near Namdaemun for the rest of the trip. Everything we did with not much detail: Itaewon, Leeum Museum, National Korean Museum, Seoul Museum of History, Gwanghwamun Square, Gyeonbokgung, Bukcheon, Gangnam, Garosu-gil, Seoullo, Deoksungung Palace, Myeong-dong, Namsan Tower, Ikseon-dong, Insa-dong, Changdeokgung palace and secret garden, Dongdaemun, Gwangjang market, Euljiro, Hongdae, Mullae, Gyeongi Forest Park, Mangwon market, Inwangsan hike and Buam-dong

I successfully found several flasks which can keep the coffee warm enough and have a screw-on cup but always had some problem with leakage, which I traced back to the cup/lid.

I do not have time to let the cup/lid dry out completly between classes and do not want to wipe it dry every time, so whenever I screw it back on, some drops form, run down the bottle and smear onto my bag and books.

As I have to switch rooms quite often every day, this is a problem that really annoys me.

As the coffee is hot, I can't sip it straight out of the flask and need to let it cool down a bit, so I feel the cup is necessary and I would love to not have to carry around a seperate cup.

I feel having a thermal flask that has a small inner lip that goes over the cup would help mitigate this, as I do transport it in an upright position so even if some coffee builds up, it would not spill, but had no luck finding anything of the sort.

I attached a drawing of what I am picturing (tho I did overempathize the inner lip, cause I am bad at drawing, but I hope it gets the idea across).",6,1745833072.0,BuyItForLife,3,1.0,False

      updateTemperatures();
      updateFan();
      Serial.print(""At the end of the loop:"");
      Serial.println(currentBT);
    }

**The Problem:**

The temperature is read fine while the fan is ramping up to the full duty. However, once it's there, the temperature readings are ""frozen"" and don't change. Even more so, at some point the new readings stop getting output into the Serial Monitor completely. However, if I physically turn off the system (yet keep the USB connection for the Arduino) with the SW1 switch, the readings in the Serial Monitor are live again. If I add something like `delay(500);` at the end of the `loop` the situation doesn't change - once the fan gets to full speed, the temperature readings are ""frozen""

Observations:

* if I set `FAN_MAX_DUTY` lower, like 200, the temp readings continue after the fan reaches that speed.
* I tried to find a sweet spot between 200 and 250 and figured out that 225 looked like that. At 226 temp reading goes fine, but after the fan reaches that speed, the readings are ""frozen"" temporarily (the same numbers get output into the monitor), then after some period, the readings get updated and frozen again, then updated and frozen again. And at some point, again, the readings just stop getting into the Serial Monitor

So, it does look like either some buffer gets overflown when the fan reaches the top speed or the fan ""eats up"" all the power from Arduino and hence, no temp readings are happening.

It started as a fairly normal conversation, and then she picked up my mostly full iced coffee and started telling me how iced drinks are bad and I won’t live long. I reached out my hands to receive it and she kept telling me to dispose of it, but clearly my reassurances that I would do so weren’t enough for her, so she took it right over to a random drain on the platform and poured it all out, not even at a designated liquid waste receptacle. 

Thankfully another Korean tried calming her down since her reprimanding me for living in an unhealthy way began to escalate and they yelled at each other for a bit, and the lady asked how granny was gonna pay me back for the drink she poured out lol.

Let's address the elephant in the room: **Quitting digital addictions creates a massive void.** Your brain is screaming for that easy dopamine hit, and willpower alone won't cut it.

The secret most ""just quit"" advice misses? **You need to replace digital superstimulation with something equally engaging to your primal brain—but healthier for your mind, body, and future.**

I've collected the most powerful replacement activities from our 17,000+ member community. These aren't your generic ""take a walk"" suggestions—they're carefully selected to activate the same reward pathways that keep you glued to screens, but with benefits instead of costs.

# 🔥 Physical Activities That Hijack Your Reward System

**1. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)** The rapid shifts between max effort and recovery create a massive endorphin response that smashes through the dopamine ceiling of casual scrolling. The ""runner's high"" is real—and makes the Instagram buzz feel like weak coffee.

**2. Cold Water Immersion** Ice baths or cold showers trigger such an intense catecholamine release that many guys report feeling ""high"" for hours afterward. The Wim Hof method combines this with breathing techniques for an even stronger neurochemical cocktail.

**3. Bouldering/Rock Climbing** Problem-solving + physical challenge + height exposure = your brain's perfect storm of engagement. The focus required makes it impossible to think about checking notifications.

**4. Sprint Training** The explosive power recruitment triggers testosterone production and growth hormone release that makes you feel superhuman compared to the low-energy state after a scrolling session.

# 🧠 Mental Challenges That Outcompete Digital Stimulation

**5. Chess (or Go)** These games activate the same strategic, reward-anticipating neural pathways as competitive video games, but with the added benefits of face-to-face interaction and transferable cognitive skills.

**6. Learning a Language Through Immersion** Apps won't cut it. Find language exchange partners and force yourself to communicate. The combination of social connection and the dopamine of successful communication creates a powerful reward loop.

**7. Public Speaking Groups** The adrenaline rush of speaking before others creates a natural high that makes social media interaction feel bland by comparison. The fear you overcome each time also rewires your confidence pathways.

**8. Debate Clubs** The competitive element, quick thinking requirements, and social victory create a dopamine signature remarkably similar to winning online arguments—except you develop transferable skills.

# 👥 Social Activities That Fill The Connection Void

**9. Improvisation/Acting Classes** The combination of social bonding, creative expression, and stepping outside comfort zones creates a neurochemical cocktail that digital interaction can't compete with.

**10. Team Sports With Clear Objectives** Soccer, basketball, ultimate frisbee—activities with points, goals and clear winning conditions engage your brain's competitive reward systems the same way online gaming does.

**11. Dance Classes (especially partner dancing)** Physical touch, rhythm, skill progression, and social connection hit multiple reward pathways simultaneously. Guys report that the first time they successfully lead a dance feels better than any gaming achievement.

**12. Volunteer Work With Immediate Feedback** Serving food, building houses, or mentoring creates what researchers call a ""helper's high""—a profound sense of meaning and connection that makes digital validation seem hollow.

# 🔧 Creation Activities That Outperform Consumption

**13. Woodworking/Carpentry** The combination of problem-solving, physical activity, visible progress, and creating something permanent activates reward pathways digital activities can't touch.

**14. Cooking Complex Dishes From Scratch** The multisensory experience, technical challenge, and primal satisfaction of feeding yourself and others hits nutritional, creative, and social reward pathways simultaneously.

**15. Musical Instrument Mastery** The progression system of learning music mirrors video game ""leveling up"" perfectly, but develops a skill you can use for life. Playing with others creates social bonds digital interaction can't match.

**16. Writing (physical journal or creative work)** The tactile engagement of pen on paper plus the cognitive benefits of processing your thoughts creates what psychologists call ""flow state""—the most engaged and rewarding mental state possible.

# 🌿 Experiences That Reset Your Stimulation Threshold

**17. Multi-Day Wilderness Trips** 48+ hours away from civilization resets your brain's baseline stimulation requirements. Many guys report digital content feeling ""too intense"" or ""artificial"" after these trips.

**18. Meditation Retreats** Extended silent meditation creates such profound alterations in your reward circuitry that former digital addicts often report completely losing interest in mindless scrolling afterward.

**19. Psychedelic Experiences (where legal)** Under proper guidance, substances like psilocybin create perspective shifts so profound that many participants spontaneously reduce or eliminate digital addictions. Research shows a single session can increase ""cognitive flexibility"" for months.

**20. Fasting (24+ hours)** The metabolic switch to ketosis creates mental clarity that makes the brain fog of digital overconsumption painfully obvious by contrast.

# 🧪 The 30/60/90 Protocol

Our community's most successful members follow this replacement strategy:

**First 30 days:** Try at least 5 activities from this list, minimum 3 hours each **Days 30-60:** Narrow down to 3 favorites, practicing each at least twice weekly **Days 60-90:** Select your primary replacement and schedule it into your calendar like it's a job

**The key insight?** Don't try to eliminate digital stimulation—replace it with something better.

I’ve been living in my car for 7 months now — since November 2024.
Before I get into the details, here’s a little background:

I met my boyfriend, Jaden, through my “father.” His girlfriend at the time had a son, and they thought we would be a good match. I reached out to him through Instagram, and we met for the first time on November 8, 2024. That night, we drank a lot, and I remember telling him I loved him because of how good he made me feel. A few weeks later, we decided to get a place together.

Jaden’s mom offered us a house she owned — it used to be her father’s before he passed away. She said rent would be $900 a month, and we agreed. At the time, I hadn’t even seen the house yet; I just wanted so badly to move out.

In those first few weeks, Jaden and I were inseparable — always hanging out, drinking, or just being together.
When moving day finally came, I saw the house for the first time… and it wasn’t what I expected. There was no running water, just electricity. The place was filthy and filled with junk. It took all of us helping to clear just enough space for a small living room, where I crammed my whole bedroom onto a mattress on the floor, surrounded by my desk and dressers.

The kitchen was dirty and full of mice — we had to hide our food in the fridge to keep it safe.
That first day, I opened up to Jaden about something I had been hiding for years: my “father” had been sexually abusing me since I was 12. He was angry for me, but I begged him not to tell anyone yet because I wasn’t ready.

We were paying $500 every two weeks for that house, without a car or much else. Thankfully, Jaden had a job that would pick him up from the house.
After about four months, we decided we needed something better — and moved into a nice two-bedroom apartment.

It was around this time we decided to tell Jaden’s mom what my “father” had done to me. She didn’t believe me and walked away from our lives. Jaden cut ties with her after that.

We were paying $900 a month for the apartment, still with no car. Eventually, in August 2024, we got a 2023 Chevy Malibu — but it came with a $675 monthly payment plus $200 for insurance. Money got very tight.

I got pregnant and had to stop working. I stayed home to cook and clean while Jaden worked long hours, leaving at 7 AM and coming home at 3 PM after commuting to Texas for his job as an LDAR technician. He quit that job to find something closer to home for me, but he couldn’t find anything in time. When we couldn’t pay rent anymore, we were evicted. Tragically, around the same time, I had a miscarriage.

Since November, we’ve been living in our car, along with two cats I adopted for emotional support.
It’s been incredibly hard. I tried to make ends meet by doing DoorDash deliveries, but I was the only one able to drive. Jaden found a few jobs but kept quitting shortly after starting. Meanwhile, my car started breaking down from all the delivery driving.

I got a job at a pizza place but eventually got fired because my car issues caused me to miss too many shifts.
Then Jaden got a retail job and stuck with it for a while. I found work at a coffee shop, but he eventually quit again, and shortly after, I had to leave my job too — we had to move to my hometown suddenly after an incident where Jaden had a mental health breakdown.

When we arrived, I got a job immediately. I started reconnecting with my mom, sometimes staying at her house.
However, tension built up because Jaden still hadn’t found work, and my mom got frustrated.
One night, things escalated — my mom got into a heated argument with Jaden and ended up getting physical with him. She scratched him badly. It’s important to say that Jaden never hit her, touched her, or raised his hands toward her in any way. He didn’t fight back.
After that, we left, and I haven’t spoken to her since.

Recently, Jaden finally found a new job, but he hasn’t started yet. Meanwhile, we’ve been arguing a lot.
I feel exhausted, trapped, and completely alone.
I have no family, no friends to turn to.
I’m just trying to survive day by day, but I don’t know what to do anymore. I just need help on what to do…

I’ve been thinking about starting a GoFundMe to try and get help, but honestly, I don’t even know where to start. I feel so lost and unsure if anyone would even be there to support me. I don’t have family or friends to lean on, and it’s hard to ask for help when I feel so alone. I just know that I need a way to get back on my feet, and even though it’s scary to put myself out there, I’m trying to have hope that someone might care enough to help.",2,1745831249.0,urbancarliving,3,0.75,False
