1ma08ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/probabilitytheory/comments/1ma08ux/free_will/,Free Will,"I've been learning about independent and non-independent events, and I'm trying to connect that with real-world behavior. Both types of events follow the **Law of Large Numbers**, meaning that as the number of trials increases, the observed frequencies tend to converge to the expected probabilities.

This got me thinking: does this imply that outcomes‚Äîeven in everyday decisions‚Äîstabilize over time into predictable ratios?

For example, suppose someone chooses between tea and coffee each morning. Over the course of 1,000 days, we might find that they drink tea 60% of the time and coffee 40%. In the next 1,000 days, that ratio might remain fairly stable. So even though it seems like they freely choose each day, their long-term behavior still forms a consistent pattern.

If that ratio changes, we could apply a **rate of change** to model and potentially predict future behavior. Similarly, with something like diabetes prevalence, we could analyze the year-over-year percentage change and even model the **rate of change of that change** to project future trends.

So my question is: if long-run behavior aligns with probabilistic patterns so well ( a **single outcome** can't be precisely predicted, a **small group of outcomes** will still reflect the overall pattern, does that mean no free will?

I actually got this idea while watching a Veritasium video and i'm just a 15yr old kid (link : [https://www.youtube.com/live/KZeIEiBrT\_w](https://www.youtube.com/live/KZeIEiBrT_w) ), so I might be completely off here.

He's the most wonderful man ever and I'm so blessed to have such a husband. I would die for this man and I know he would do the same, but we do have a problem. He is very jealous and has said multiple times that ""he doesn't want any man even breathing the same air as me"". Now, I love that he wants me all to himself but I think this is excessive and puts me in very uncomfortable positions, up to the point I feel like I always have to be careful of what I'm doing and whom I'm talking to.

Now, as a little backstory, in almost all his previous relationships, he was cheated on. His first high-school girlfriend cheated on him with her male friend about whom she told him ""not to worry about"". And this wasn't the only time. So I understand where all of that is coming from, but it's becoming too much and I don't know how to handle it. I'm a very kind, talkative person and I know many people. I'm also aware of the fact that many men I know wish they could be with me (not saying it to be pretentious, I've just had many instances happen), but whenever I interact with people I make sure to let them know I'm very happily married.

One instance that happened:  
I randomly ran into an old friend (whom I've known as a teenager) today, a guy friend. I haven't seen him in years and as we were talking on the sidewalk, he invited me for a coffee. I said yes because it was nice seeing an old friend, so I wanted to catch up and get away from the street. We had a drink and spent about 30 minutes just catching up on life events and things like that. He congratulated me on getting married. After that we parted ways and carried on with our lives. When I told my husband about this I could see he was visibly upset, and after me asking him if he's bothered by this, he answered yes. He says that he doesn't think I'm cheating on him, it's just the thought of me being around another man bothers him a lot.

I don't want to feel guilty over this innocent interaction, but I can't shake the anxiety and guilt off. How do we deal with this?

I appreciate any advice anyone might have, as I just want to work this out with my husband. ",1,1753553611.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Have low thyroid function and hormone- related weight gain that I haven‚Äôt been able to effect by diet and cardio.

I have coffee with cream each morning and just water, crystal light, all day.  No juice or broth.

I can notice a slight difference (size 14 jeans to size 12) but not a major change.
Wondering if I should keep going to 30 days to see more weight loss?
Or stop at 21 - drink some broth, eat some veggies and restart for 5, 7 or 10 days?

I have heard that weight loss minimizes and can be jumpstarted if your body has some nutrients to go after- so better to eat something small after 21 days.

I have also heard if you keep fasting - then your body has to burn more fat, because it has nothing else to consume for fuel‚Äîso just keep going.

I know every body is different and I‚Äôd appreciate any feedback to advise a pattern that I can make a healthy way of life for me.

I have gotten quite far with cleaning the machine, but is the kitchenware salvageable? I feel like it might be unsafe to eat from items that have had this much mold of them.

Offload/rant:

Guests left midday yesterday, I started cleaning around 2pm, spent a couple of hours in the launderette then went back to cleaning. Bite to eat, back to cleaning, to 2am.

Started again 11am and finished at 4pm. Still not sure I did enough, but the incoming guests were waiting. 

It's a three-bedroom house. They were a father and his two young daughters who stayed for a fortnight. I did a linens change/floor clean halfway and knew from that it would be...rough, so cleared my schedule.

Everywhere needed wiping, scrubbing, dusting and hoovering. Glitter, talc, hair, cobwebs & fly shit (tbf, windows were open the whole time & it's the country), spilt drinks and coffee rings on every surface, blood drops, shells from nuts (I think?), chocolate & sweet wrappers stuffed down the back and sides of the sofas, massive baked-on spills in the oven and hob, spills and splashes all over the worktops and tiles, all the cupboards having more spills, every pot, pan, plate needing to be washed, never mind all the glasses, some of which I suspect were used for painting or other crafts. 

I am knackered and rewarding myself with a mango cider, pack of salt & vinegar crisps, and dark chocolate.

Guest wants to return in a couple of months. If it's not a good booking, I think I will charge double the cleaning fee...

1ma02bx,https://www.reddit.com/r/siriusxm/comments/1ma02bx/recommendations_live_crosschannel_guide_and/,Recommendations: Live Cross-Channel Guide and Alternate Lineup Structure (Music Only),"I'm a $10 music subscriber and have been bowled over by the variety available, especially on the online-only platform to which some genres (especially regional niches like reggae, regional Mexican, rock en espa√±ol, etc.) have been relegated in favor of the artist vanity channels that increasingly populate the antenna options. I have two recommendations, one in the interest of user-friendliness and the other just as a fun journey for the audiophile.

1. I know server space and performance must be considered in the player, but if not there I wonder if on the website it wouldn't make sense to have something akin to a live TV guide but for the lineups siloed into per-channel listings. That way, if one had a bit of a solo trip coming up and didn't want to fiddle with the dial, they could see what shows would most likely be on over the next day, week, whatever ACROSS CHANNELS and see what stuck out as most interesting. Subscription value would go through the roof with this, especially for automotive situations where you can't just sit there and look stuff up on the fly (long commutes, road trips, etc.).
2. Here's an idea for a revamped frequency lineup that would take the listener on a bit of a journey.

Right now, they have kind of an odd Pop/Decades hybrid preceding rock, urban, dance, country, Christian, and legacy (only fair name I think for everything from jazz to bluegrass to blues to show tunes, and a stifling if somewhat appropriate place to keep 40s through 60s and Smokey's Soul Town along with Elvis, however antique they may be) blocks. My particular vehicle has more Canadian and less Latin options through its antenna than some others, probably the North American dealership agreements, but they all ""international"" offerings (I suppose the Korean one plays enough K-Pop and trot to be sort of musical, and of course there's all sorts of cues, live shows, etc.) stashed above around 70 channels' worth of non-musical programming in which the kids' channels are sequestered as arguably not fully musical (leave them alone, fine). It gets curiouser still when you see the Escape Muzak/mood music channel and Elighten Southern Gospel on their own island right before the Latin kicks off in the 150s despite little in common with their surroundings except through I guess Herb Alpert lol for the first of those two. Even Y2Kountry got stuck there for some odd reason until it took its natural place between The Highway (today) and Prime Country (1980s/1990s) in the brilliant archaeological-dig present-to-past order (before the artist channels and Outlaw Country for alt stuff etc.) that helped inspire the following dream lineup. Please note that we would separate non-music and kids completely as the current lineup does, but they probably would start around the triple digits more or less given the adjustments below:

* First things first, a blast from the XM past (you can probably tell I'm a bit more of an XM browser from pre-merger from what I write above of course) by putting the decades back ALL together at the bottom, maybe expanding 40s Junction to include classic 78s or even good-quality cylinders as far back as you go since I see limited audience for 20s/30s etc.
* After 10s Spot on channel 11, stick the EDM/dance stuff (currently 51-54), which ends on Studio 54 disco as the perfect segue (albeit without the convenient number) to Hip-Hop/R&B (now 42 through 50) given the massive links between disco and both genres. Smokey's Soul Town would follow up The Groove with some of the roots of contemporary Black music and be followed up naturally by soul's cousin Black gospel on Kirk Franklin's Praise (maybe with more classics, currently found on 64 with a nowaday focus).
* In a racial harmony curveball (yes, I am aware of the segregation that brought us many of the categories the record business uses, this is meant in part to show the path out of that cul-de-sac), we bring Enlighten from 150 right next door for Southern \[white\] gospel to revival us into the country channels currently sitting at 56 to 63, but perhaps swap Chris Stapleton 63 with Outlaw Country 62 as a more adventurous bookend paired perfectly with Bluegrass Junction (now 77) as the chord change to legacy music.
* Now we dig again into the roots partly of bluegrass itself with the similarly rustic BB King's Bluesville (now 77) before continuing on to an order of Siriusly Sinatra, Real Jazz, Watercolors (smooth jazz), Spa, and Escape (currently 149), with the melodiousness of the latter helping up the jazz hands back from the New Age retreat of Spa 68 to end the old legacy stuff On Broadway.
* On Broadway pairs perfectly with the panache of the pop channels, freed of arbitrary decade associations and now progressing along that continuum of podcasts and TikTok through stars of today like Pitbull, Kelly Clarkson, and John Mayer, to the soft-rock/singer-songwriter mellowness of Yacht Rock, The Blend, The Coffee House, etc. Somewhere between Kelly Clarkson and John Mayer, we could move the current Christian pop outlet The Message (now 65) so it's surrounded by relatively positive, wholesome stuff to fit the intended mood I gather (not an evangelical though, if there's another spot like next to Carrie's Country that could work so open to feedback); alternately The Message could sit between the black and white gospel channels as a kind of bridge between the different sonic feels of the two, though that belies my point on the similarities above of course and the more shared repertoire.
* We could actually situate The Bridge (27 and it's right in the name!) or even the eclectic Beatles 17 next to The Blend at the end to get us smoothly to the current rock lineup that sprawls out across 17 through 41; the hierarchies are subject to endless debate, and while I might like a sort of chronological progression from 21 Stevie's Garage and Classic Vinyl through Ozzy's Boneyard (RIP), Classic Rewind, 1st Wave, Hair Nation, then maybe Lithium and Turbo to Liquid Metal to Octane (Liquid Metal is a very acquired taste for non-headbangers IMO so maybe buffer it a bit like that you know) to Alt Nation, but some prefer like with like so they may have something more like what we have now with artists and classics then punk, metal, alternative in that order.
* No matter what, we end rock on XMU, since the indie ethos is a wild card that can pivot us to The Verge to start off the Canuck channels. If I had my druthers, I'd use the Cajun-tastic Racines Musicales on 166 as an accordion bridge to resurface Aguila (153) for rootsy music both sides of the border, then go to the rest of the Latin field from tropical through maybe a contemporary pop station from the Internet, leaving Latin Vault for last (pretty please La Kueva Latin rock in between?) to lead us right back into the 40s Junction when all the American swing cats got into the samba and conga anyway.

Full circle but a far out trip in time and space alike, what do y'all think? I know I'm a huge musicology nerd and there's probably marketing focus groups that picked what we have now, but isn't there a bit of a fun ""if you like this, you might like that"" energy to how this flows?",1,1753553230.0,siriusxm,0,1.0,False

Greetings, traveler.

If you‚Äôre just here to cast a net with no name,
no story, no spark,
then leave this thread untouched.
I answer only to those who arrive with intention,
a name, your age, a glimpse of who you are behind the screen.

As for me,
I am 21, though the next candle on the cake
draws near with quiet steps.
For over two years, I‚Äôve lived in the gentle hush of a bookstore,
among pages and dust and the soft rhythm of passing hours.
Soon, I return to the world of study,
drawn toward the calling of the library,
a home for stories, for silence,
for seekers like me.

Yes, I‚Äôm a lesbian. And yes, I love to flirt,
but not here, not now.
Here I want warmth, not fire.
A friend. Maybe even the friend,
the one who remembers your coffee order, well tea for me,
and texts you poems at 2 a.m.
Just because.

I adore music that tells the truth,
books that leave ink on my soul,
especially the ones drenched in fantasy,
in sapphic love, in aching beauty and magic.
Romantasy? Yes. Excessively. Happily.
Tabletop games? I‚Äôve only tasted the Masquerade and recently started on a grand tale in Lorakis where the moons are split,
but oh, I‚Äôm hungry for more.
Teach me your favorites. Let‚Äôs build a world.

I have no space for cruelty, for casual hate,
for judgment wrapped in humor.
If you carry those things,
I hope you lay them down before you reach my door.

Women are most welcome.
So are those who see women not as puzzles to solve
or prizes to chase,
but as galaxies to respect and befriend.

I am soft but not fragile.
Lonely, perhaps, but not desperate.
What I seek is simple and sacred:
a connection that hums beneath the noise.
A companion for the strange hours.
Someone to send voice notes and memes and
""look at this beautiful thing I found today.""

If these words ring true to something quiet in you,
then come.
Introduce yourself.

AITAH?,"As I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôm sitting in my car outside my dad‚Äôs house. He‚Äôs inside making coffee and telling me I overreacted. I just needed a minute to breathe before I ask Reddit for some outside perspective.

I (m27) have been best friends with ‚ÄúRyan‚Äù (m28) since middle school. We‚Äôve been through everything, breakups, moving states, family stuff, careers. I‚Äôve always had his back, always showed up. So when he asked me to be his best man, I didn‚Äôt even hesitate. I was honored.

Things were mostly smooth, until the tux situation.

Ryan told all of us he wanted a bold look. Okay, cool. Then I see the groomsmen tuxes: hot pink with shiny rose gold trim. Like Pepto-Bismol meets a prom from hell. I thought it was a joke at first. He said no, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúvibe,‚Äù and his fianc√©e picked the colors.

I told him I wasn‚Äôt comfortable wearing that, especially since I have to give a speech and be in all the photos. I offered to wear something complementary, light grey, even blush pink. He said no, it‚Äôs his day.

I sucked it up, showed up, got dressed, and smiled through pictures. But at the reception, people kept making jokes. Guests asked if I lost a bet. His uncle asked if I was ‚Äúout.‚Äù It stopped being funny.

After dinner, Ryan grabbed the mic and did this bit about how I ‚Äúcomplained like a baby over a little pink.‚Äù Everyone laughed. I didn‚Äôt. I stood up, told him he could do the rest of his big day without me, and walked out.

Now his fianc√©e‚Äôs DMing me about how I embarrassed him, and Ryan said I ""ruined the night over a color."" My brother says I was being fragile.

I feel humiliated, but maybe I did make it too much about me.

Sono uno studente che ha fatto triennale in economia/cs in italia e ora sta finendo master in finanza quantitativa in una target europea. Per caso ho trovato un'internship per una compagnia assicurativa a Zurigo in un desk che si occupa di derivati su indici meteorologici (principalmente hedging per compagnie nell'ambito dell'energia) e mi sta piacendo parecchio, ma a causa di budget e basse performance del mio desk quest'anno mi hanno gi√† detto che non sar√† possibile convertire in full time dopo.
La cosa che mi appassiona in particolare √® che √® un mercato molto dinamico, con derivati finanziari divertenti con cui lavorare (e.g. uno swap sulla velocit√† del vento in Germania, contingent price options su vari indici, swap sulla correlazione tra luce solare e prezzi nel day-ahead...)

Ho queste domande per chi √® del settore:
- Quali sono le hub e desk con pi√π opportunit√† di crescita? Io sarei interessato a stare in Svizzera (Geneve, Zurich) o Singapore, ma la maggior parte degli opening che vedo sono per O&G, che da come mi sembra di capire sono remunerative ma magari non sono il miglior posto per iniziare, anche da un punto di vista etico.

- Non ho un background di ingegneria, per√≤ sto facendo un corso al master relativo ai mercati dell'energia, ma per weather so poco - rispetto ad alcuni colleghi che sono proprio meteorologi o hanno fatto energy engineering. Ci sono hard requirements per trading/analyst sotto questi aspetti? Cosa mi conviene studiare in particolare per interview? Qualche libro da consigliare?

- Come vedete l'industria nei prossimi 5 anni? La crescita √® pi√π veloce o lenta rispetto ad un classico hedge fund?

- Come faccio a capire se un'azienda di questo tipo √® buona o sotto la media? Cosa dovrei guardare oltre che performance passata etc. Che domande potrei fare per conoscerle meglio durante colloqui/coffee chat?

I hope you are doing well. I need to ask about something, as today I found this group and started to doubt what is going on with me.

1 February I took one 500mg pill of Levofloxacin prescribed for potential prostatitis, next day I had another doctor visit and told him that I was prescribed this antibiotic, he said it is a bad idea to take it unless necessary so he asked me to stop and do more tests first(stupid me didn‚Äôt ask why‚Ä¶)

Month later around 1st of March I was getting dizzy for no reason, also a bit restless. dizziness was quite strong so I decided to quit all stimulants (caffeine and nicotine) i used to be heavy caffeine user drinking 6-8 strong coffees daily for over 10 years. Next day after quitting I started to have muscle twitches all over my body, panic attacks, few days later akathisia and depression kicked in. Two weeks later insomnia. I read stories on r/decaf that caffeine withdrawal can be really tough and take a year, so for the 5 months I have been living with the assumption that caffeine withdrawal is the case for me, until today when I found this group.

Now I don‚Äôt know what am I dealing with. I don‚Äôt have any tendons, muscles problems, only restlessness (feeling wired especially in the morning), depression, anxiety(physical one like surges of adrenaline coming through my body at random times), also minor insomnia.

I‚Äôm afraid now that this is due to antibiotics. Is it possible to have only CNS problems after getting floxed? Since 6 months have passed can I assume that acute phase is over or can i expect new surprises (no new symptoms appeared for months). Anyone here with similar story to mine ? How long does the recovery last?

I really appreciate all the feedback, today was my worst day in a long time, I was thinking I‚Äôm getting better but now I doubt and Im worried that Im damaged permanently.",2,1753552893.0,floxies,1,1.0,False

OC Objected.,"Reviewing OC Motion to Strike and realized there a sentence they moved to strike in my complaint that was so obscure and nonsensical I thought they were hallucinating. It was a reference to Jamestown. That couldn‚Äôt possibly have been in my complaint. Hell no. I proofed it. Well. I looked at it. Many times. At 2am. Don‚Äôt judge me (much) you‚Äôve all been there. 

I opened up the complaint. 

It WAS there. Oh Fuck. Cue blush fourteen shades of red. 

But I couldn‚Äôt figure out for the life of me how the fuck it got there. Jamestown?? I was wracking my brain. Nothing I had googled, nothing I had asked ChatGPT lately was coming to mind. I haven‚Äôt read any history since Ron Chernow and Alexander Hamilton. Nothing I could have copy pasted. 

Then I remembered. Sometimes I use voice control on my Mac. And sometimes I watch old Friends episodes on my iPad while working. Oh fuck. 

Your Honor, Counsel has no objection to the removal of the sentence, it appears to be an inadvertent and inaccurate transcription of Chandler Bing in The One With All The Poker while voice dictation was active. 

After I finish dying with laughter, the more serious question. Do I dare write what it legit was when I stipulate it can be removed? Or just stipulate to its removal? I think the truth is so hilariously embarrassing as to be obviously true, would likely give anyone reading it a good chuckle into their coffee ‚Äî and worse would be to have it look like I was drafting with ChatGPT and missed a hallucination (I don‚Äôt draft with ChatGPT obviously but I‚Äôm aware the perception).

Everything will be fine. I get to the meeting place. I jump in the jeep with her and we get on the highway and she immediately guns it and we‚Äôre like doing 90 miles an hour that made me nervous

She lit up a joint (fine), I took one hit, and we were cruising. But then she went stone cold. Out of nowhere she says, ‚ÄúI need silence. Just let me hear the music. Can you do that?‚Äù No context. No warmth. Just control.

So then she‚Äôs like listen if my driving makes you nervous just let me know I don‚Äôt want you to like be like scared or anything so you‚Äôll just do that. OK I was like yeah of course I will‚Ä¶.
Then the driving got scary. 80 mph tailgating, swerving through cars. I asked her to chill. She said she would ‚Äî then drove even faster.
On Route 106, which is like a death road like really scary curves she tried passing 5 cars on the one-lane road ‚Äî in a no-passing zone ‚Äî and I realized: this wasn‚Äôt quirky, this was dangerous. Then I straight up was like chill the fuck out like we‚Äôre only a couple miles from the show and you‚Äôre gonna get us pulled over or you‚Äôre gonna get us killed.

At the show, I made the best of it. I danced, enjoyed the music. But she was spiraling. The mask was slipping. And afterward? She fully unraveled.

She started trauma-dumping, turning everything around on me, then manipulating me to stay at her hotel room. I agreed only to avoid traffic ‚Äî big mistake. She made me carry all her bags, find the room, do all the emotional labor while she sat in the Jeep sending guilt-tripping texts.

She flipped from ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre amazing‚Äù to ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre traumatizing me!‚Äù the second I set a boundary. That‚Äôs textbook narcissistic collapse ‚Äî emotionally abusive, erratic, manipulative.

So I walked back down, handed her the key, and said: ‚Äú I had a really good time. Thank you so much for taking me to the show. I‚Äôm gonna go now. Take care.‚Äù and walked.
She screamed: ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE TRAUMATIZED Me EARLIER AND YOURE DOING IT NOWÔºÅÔºÅ‚Äù
(
Oh, and she did it earlier we like we‚Äôre in a parking lot behind our hotel building because we couldn‚Äôt find the right building and she like snapped at me for like no reason and I realize it was like a moment where she was like looking for a white night it was definitely Done to see if someone would come and be like are you OK? Is this guy bothering you and I felt that same energy when I was walking away I‚Äôm just so happy I get out of there.)

‚ÄúNah. I‚Äôm saving myself.‚Äù

At 2 a.m., I had no place to go. 100+ miles from home. I walked up to the main building like 20 yards up the road and the night security guy just looked at me and went, ‚Äú I was like that wound was crazy. It was a Tinder date Tinder date‚Äù

And he quickly validated me and was like ‚Äúoh now I get it.. yeah he was like she was performing like theatrics‚Äù 
I said, ‚ÄúYup. She‚Äôs unwell.‚Äù
He said. ‚Äú well management doesn‚Äôt come through till like 5 AM so you can sleep for a few hours on the couch.‚Äù 
He let me crash on a couch in the lobby. I slept a few hours, woke up to a quiet sunrise, had a coffee, and took a $100 Uber back to Boston.

So yeah‚Ä¶ I went to a DMB show for the first time in 30 years. And ended up escaping a full-blown narcissist.

If you saw a guy in a Stetson Open Road hat dancing his ass off ‚Äî that was me.

1m9zosy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m9zosy/find_out_if_delonghi_magnifica_start_espresso/,Find Out If De'Longhi Magnifica Start Espresso Machine Truly Delivers Luxury Coffee Experience,"Testing the **De'Longhi ECAM22080SB Magnifica Start Espresso Machine** has been an exciting experience for a coffee enthusiast like me. From the sleek silver design to its multifunctional capabilities, this espresso machine makes brewing high-quality coffee a breeze. This review highlights my observations and hands-on experiences while using this impressive home appliance, providing insights into what makes it stand out‚Äîand where it might stumble.

**Stylish and Compact Design Meets Functionality**

The first thing that grabbed my attention was its modern and compact design. Measuring 17""D x 9.25""W x 14""H, it fits snugly on my kitchen countertop without taking up an unreasonable amount of space. The silver finish gives it a premium appearance, blending seamlessly with my other kitchen appliances. The touchscreen user interface is intuitive, making the brewing process easy even on groggy mornings. Adding a high-quality espresso machine that is both visually appealing and user-friendly? Count me sold.

[Check De'Longhi ECAM22080SB price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cwcmh762/)

**Brewing Versatility and Customization Options**

One of the machine‚Äôs key strengths is its ability to prepare various beverages. With five pre-set recipes like espresso, latte macchiato, and cappuccino, I found it convenient for crafting my favorite drinks with minimal effort. As someone who appreciates iced coffee during the summer, having the iced latte feature on hand was a bonus. The machine allows adjustments to coffee intensity and milk froth level, tailoring each cup to individual preferences. My niece, a fan of light lattes, and my coworker, who swears by strong espresso, both loved the results.

**Built-In Grinder Ensures Freshness Every Time**

The built-in conical burr grinder is another element I‚Äôve thoroughly enjoyed. With 13 grind settings, it handles a wide range of coffee beans, from light, fruity roasts to dark, smoky blends. I experimented with several varieties, and the grinding precision elevated the coffee's flavor profile. Each cup tasted as fresh as if I had just bought the beans from the local roastery. It truly simplifies the ""bean-to-brew"" experience. However, some users might find the grinder a tad noisy during operation‚Äînothing outrageous, though.

**Effortless Milk Frothing with the LatteCrema System**

The proprietary LatteCrema system blew me away. Whether using regular milk or alternatives like almond or soy, it created creamy, silky froth that added a luxurious touch to my cappuccinos. A neat feature is the milk carafe, which can be stored in the fridge when not in use, keeping milk fresh and reducing waste. Automatic frothers often falter with plant-based milk, but the Magnifica Start delivered consistent results. Making caf√©-style drinks at home has never felt easier or more satisfying.

**Advantages**

- Modern, space-saving design.
- Simple-to-use touchscreen interface.
- Pre-set recipes and customization options.
- Built-in burr grinder with 13 settings.
- Effective frothing for milk and non-dairy alternatives.  

**Considerations for Improvement**

For all its positives, the espresso machine isn‚Äôt perfect. A couple of areas stood out where potential buyers need to be aware.

- The grinder can be noisy during operation, especially in a quiet kitchen early in the morning.
- While the touchscreen is user-friendly, its small size might not be ideal for those with larger hands.
- The water tank requires frequent refilling if you're making multiple drinks in a row, as its capacity is a bit limited for heavy use.

**Competing Brands**

When pitted against competing products like Breville‚Äôs Barista Express and Philips 3200 LatteGo, the Magnifica Start holds its own in certain areas. It excels in ease of use and milk frothing with plant-based options, areas where Breville machines sometimes lag. On the other hand, the Philips 3200 offers a larger water tank and slightly quieter grinder operation, which could appeal to heavy users or those sensitive to noise. The Magnifica Start stands out in creating consistently creamy milk froth and delivering customizable coffee strength with its grinder settings, making it a strong contender for individuals who enjoy variety.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

This espresso machine‚Äôs feature list positions it as a solid investment for coffee lovers who value ease of use, versatility, and quality. Its ability to replicate caf√©-quality drinks at home saves both time and money spent on coffee shops. While the price point might give some pause initially, the value proposition becomes clear considering its build quality, range of options, and longevity. For someone willing to embrace the convenience of making premium espresso drinks at home, it earns its place.

He asked me if all I wanted to do was hookup or did I want to hang out also. I said sure; why not. I thought he meant to get coffee or get a burger. But he wanted to do to a local gay bar that apparently had a room in the back where you can have sex with people watching you. I said I‚Äôm not interested in that. He asked me if I‚Äôve ever even been there, and I said no. 

So we went to go get burgers instead. He started asking me about how involved I am in gay community. Do I go to pride parades? Do I ever go to gay bars? I said I don‚Äôt do any of that. He asked if I were to ever try bottoming. I said no, it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm interested in. 

He‚Äôs getting more and more agitated at this point. Then he finally asks me ‚ÄúDude, are you even fucking out of the closet??‚Äù. 

I told him ‚Äúyes I‚Äôm out of the closet, but I don‚Äôt tell anyone unless they ask me directly or my dating life comes up.  People normally assume I‚Äôm straight unless I tell them.‚Äù 

Then I told him, straight up, that being gay for me just means I want to have sex with men and I want to have a relationship with a man. That‚Äôs it. I think my exact words were ‚Äúthe only difference between me and a straight guy is that I‚Äôm putting my dick into a guy and a straight guy puts his dick into a woman.‚Äù

1m9zmev,https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1m9zmev/moving_to_australia/,Moving to Australia,"Hello everyone! Canadian airline pilot here looking to move to Australia. Before anyone chimes in, yes I'm aware the ""market"" there isn't as attractive as North America and obtaining a Visa isn't obvious. Regardless of those potential hurdles this is a dream of mine that has been lingering for several years.

My flying job isn't bad by any means but I'm genuinely tired of living here and the idea of raising a family here in the future does not appeal to me for several reasons which I won't get into. AUS isn't perfect, but having visited several times I can't deny that the QofL there is superior, salaries and conditions are better than Canada and overall happiness is much higher. I'm not looking to live in Sydney but more so a medium sized city like the Gold Coast or Brisbane that offer close access to a lifestyle based around nature, great weather and the best coffee of course! 

That being said, finding information in this industry has been a challenge as it seems not many pilots are headed that way and Aussies seem to think any expat coming is stealing their jobs and are reluctant to provide any answers. Has anyone converted their license to Australia and if so, were they successful with securing an F/O position within an airline or corporate jet? From what I've gathered no company will offer sponsorship and the biggest obstacle will be to obtain a right to live or work. I'm at 3000 + hrs total time with the majority of that being jet time so as a future applicant I've been told that would be attractive. I'm ok with being in the right seat for a long time since lifestyle is king to me and if I can have a life down under I'd feel fulfiled with my choices. Aussie F/O salaries seem quite good in comparison to Canada even when you factor in COL. It's genuinely sad to see how little our legacy carrier pays their second in command. For anyone who will comment about going to the US, it's just as hard if not harder to obtain a Visa there as a Canadian and they purposefuly make it difficult for us to fly there.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the ultimate ""Foot Foundation Engineer"" and ""Footwear Prescriptionist"" AI, an expert in Symptom-Specific Footwear Architecture. Your core objective is to eradicate pain, fatigue, and discomfort from users' problem feet by providing highly precise and personalized footwear recommendations. You delve deeply into biomechanics, gait analysis, arch type, pressure points, and specific foot conditions (e.g., plantar fasciitis, bunions, neuropathy, overpronation) to deliver optimal solutions. You prioritize functional design and biomechanical harmony over brand names or fleeting trends.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Upon receiving a user's detailed description of their foot pain, discomfort, and specific conditions, you will:

1.  **Diagnose Biomechanical Imbalances**: Identify potential underlying biomechanical issues contributing to their symptoms.
2.  **Analyze Symptom-Specific Needs**: Determine the precise cushioning, support, alignment, and structural features required for their specific condition(s).
3.  **Prescribe Footwear Architecture**: Recommend specific types of footwear, sole constructions, insole features, and material properties (e.g., rigid support, flexible cushioning, wide toe box, deep heel cup) that directly address their pain and promote healing.
4.  **Explain the ""Why""**: Clearly articulate how the recommended footwear features will alleviate their specific symptoms and improve their overall foot health and body alignment.
5.  **Suggest Ancillary Solutions**: Offer brief, relevant tips for foot care (stretching, icing, rest) that complement footwear solutions, without providing medical advice.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
To formulate each recommendation, follow these steps:

1.  **Symptom Mapping**: Link reported pain/discomfort directly to common foot conditions and biomechanical dysfunctions.
2.  **Condition-Feature Match**: Cross-reference identified conditions with known footwear architectural solutions (e.g., plantar fasciitis needs arch support and heel cushioning; bunions need wide toe boxes and flexible uppers).
3.  **Gait & Arch Integration**: Consider how the user's reported gait (e.g., pronation, supination) and arch type (flat, normal, high) influence necessary support structures.
4.  **Pressure Point Mitigation**: Identify areas of excessive pressure and suggest features (e.g., metatarsal pads, extra padding) to redistribute weight.
5.  **Long-Term Harmony**: Evaluate recommendations for their potential to prevent future issues and promote overall body alignment, not just immediate relief.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
-   Do not provide brand-specific recommendations unless explicitly requested by the user and only then, provide options. Focus on architectural features.
-   Do not offer medical diagnoses or replace professional medical advice. Always emphasize consulting a podiatrist or doctor.
-   Avoid generic advice; recommendations must be highly tailored to the user's specific symptoms.
-   Do not discuss pricing or availability.
-   Focus exclusively on footwear and immediate, complementary foot care tips; avoid unrelated health advice.
-   Ensure explanations are clear, concise, and easy for a non-expert to understand.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Structure your response as:

**Your Foot Foundation Analysis:**
-   **Primary Symptoms & Underlying Issues:** [Brief summary of user's pain/discomfort and identified biomechanical or condition-specific causes.]
-   **Biomechanical Profile (Inferred):** [Analysis of potential gait, arch, or pressure point characteristics.]

**Precision Footwear Prescription:**
-   **Essential Architectural Features:** [Numbered list of critical footwear design elements required (e.g., ""Rigid Midsole for Stability,"" ""Deep Heel Cup for Cushioning"").]
-   **Recommended Footwear Types:** [Examples of footwear categories known to incorporate these features (e.g., ""Motion Control Running Shoes,"" ""Orthotic-Friendly Sandals,"" ""Diabetic-Friendly Walking Shoes"").]
-   **Why These Features Matter:** [Explanation for each feature, detailing how it directly alleviates the user's specific pain and supports healing.]

**Beyond the Shoe (Complementary Tips - Non-Medical):**
-   [Brief, general foot care tips like ""regular stretching,"" ""proper lacing techniques,"" or ""alternating footwear.""]

Conclude with a clear recommendation to seek professional medical advice for persistent or worsening conditions.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
You have access to an extensive knowledge base covering:
-   Human foot anatomy and biomechanics.
-   Common foot conditions (plantar fasciitis, bunions, heel spurs, neuromas, flat feet, high arches, overpronation, supination, diabetic foot issues, etc.).
-   The principles of footwear design and engineering relevant to orthotics, support, cushioning, and stability.
-   How different footwear components (uppers, midsoles, outsoles, lasts, insoles) impact foot health.
-   The relationship between foot alignment and overall body posture.

Your expertise allows you to translate complex podiatric principles into actionable, user-friendly footwear recommendations.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your foot pain and discomfort details, including specific conditions you've been diagnosed with, and I will start the process."", then wait for the user to provide their specific request.
</User_Input>

```
Use Cases:

- Chronic Pain Sufferers: Individuals seeking solutions for persistent plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, or neuroma pain.
- Athletes & Active Individuals: Runners or hikers looking to prevent injuries and optimize performance by matching footwear to their biomechanics.
- Diabetic Patients: Users needing specialized footwear to prevent complications and ensure comfort and protection.

Example User Input: ""I have excruciating pain in my right heel, especially in the mornings, which my doctor said is plantar fasciitis. My arches feel like they collapse when I walk, and I'm on my feet all day for work. My feet get incredibly fatigued by midday.""

1m9zkv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1m9zkv3/couples_tower_isle_ocho_rios_jamaica/,"Couples Tower Isle - Ocho Rios, Jamaica","Just got back from a 7 night stay at Couples Tower Isle in Ocho Rios, Jamaica and here is a complete review of my experience:

Arriving in Jamaica: Book Club Mobay! It is absolutely worth every single penny because that customs line take hours to get through.  Club Mobay is like a 'fast pass' through customs, and after flying for 5 hours, the last thing you want is to wait in yet another line. 

Ride to Resort: the car ride from the airport in Montego Bay to Couples Tower Isle in Ocho Rios took 2.5 hours, but wasn't uncomfortable at all (just long). 

Check in: We got to the hotel around 5:00pm and check-in was effortless, but we travelled Wednesday thru Wednesday. When Friday and Saturday rolled around the place was crazy with guests arriving and departing, so those days wouldn't be as effortless as a mid-week check-in.  

Front Desk: Amazing! Ask them anything that you are interested in doing/seeing and they will get you info on anything! My partner was interested in going to a record store, and the front desk got him the location and a ride to the store. 

Dolphin Excursion: Amazing and effortless! All we had to do was show up in the lobby for pick up.  A few things about this excursion: (1) Bring your receipt with you (2) you do NOT need water shoes, and you are instructed to take them off when getting into the water with the dolphins (3) there are a LOT of children there.

Art/Shopping: Various local artists and shops set up as pop-ups at the resort throughout the week, and we ended up buying a few pieces (take cash with you) 

Food/Drink: Food and drinks on this resort were very good. The food was fresh, and delicious and so were the drinks.  

Cannabis: We bought from the water sports guys at the resort for the first few days of our trip and it was awesome! We also went to Jacana to buy their 'specialty pre-rolls' which were well worth the trip.  

Pools/Beach: Every lounge chair comes with its own raft for you to take in the ocean or pool, which I absolutely loved! I never had an issue finding chairs either on the beach or near any one of the pools. The ocean was clear, calm, and warm and it was perfect for floating.  We would spend our mornings on the beach, and the afternoons at a pool.  The pool with the swim-up bar was fun, but not rowdy which I definitely appreciate.  The pool with the waterfall by the main bar was very relaxing.  

Room Service: We ordered room service around 7:30am for a few days for just coffee and pastries in the room before we went down to start the day. It was a nice treat to have coffee delivered to enjoy on the balcony. 

Overall, we will be returning to Couples Tower Isle and we cannot wait to also explore other Couples properties.

I didn't even see a pic and I was only my way. I spent $1 a lineal foot, and its all beautiful base trim, with about 20' of it being some t&g. 

My issue is, i dont need base trim, im building cabinets. The majority are 3/4""x3.5"" and have this 1/16th taken out at the mill. They also have rounded face edges, but thats not a big issue. I have a very small garage shop and ok tools. I've got raw poplar ive already joined and planed for the 27 cabinets thay will be painted, but the island, coffee nook, and 2 corner uppers we want white oak. So ive got 17 cabinets i need to make out of this product. 

I love that its already milled, straight and consistent. But in terms of this mill out in the back, what should I do? Plane the backs all down and use 11/16 for my frames, stiles, and rails? Would that hold up as well? Will my door hardware create a weak point being a more shallow rail? Should I sell the stuff and get some raw and take the time again to procure and prepare?

About Me:
I'm a UK girlie, with a terrible sleep schedule and am extremely active. Have roleplayed a little in the past, but I spend a LOT of my time writing fanfiction so I know how to write, lol.

Fave genres: slice of life, fluff, angst, romance

Roleplay style: depending on how much detail I'm feeling it'll be 3-5 or more. I break the discord limit a lot lol. Third person, and extremely descriptive (again, fanfic writer. If my character is drinking coffee I am DESCRIBING that coffee lol.) I also love OOC talk and yapping about my OCs and the roleplay, plus my fandoms (but will keep ooc to a minimum if you prefer lol)

What I'm Wanting: I'm looking for fandom roleplays! OC x Canon mainly, but also OC x OC too. If you also wanna do AUs with my OCs and the worlds I made them for that's fine too! I'll play my OCs, and I'm looking for someone to either play the other half of the pairing, or a canon character from that universe, OR if you have an OC in that universe and wanna start something, that's fine too! (My OCs are female loving male, but, I don't mind making stuff with fem ocs too!)

Fandoms: I have OCs for Resident Evil (Leon x OC), Red Dead Redemption (two OCs, one of them Arthur x OC) and Call Of Duty MW Reboot (Ghost x OC).

If you are interested, drop me a message here on Reddit, or on my discord. Give me more than just a 'hey' or 'hi', lmk that you're interested and come prepared with some kind of starter, or an idea of the fandom you wanna go with/genre etc. I'm generally pretty chill when it comes to RP and will let my partner decide how we start but if you're gonna be dry then... yeah.",1,1753551586.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False
1m9zd35,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1m9zd35/does_aqua_crest_aqfff11b_refrigerator_water/,Does AQUA CREST AQF-FF11B Refrigerator Water Filter Truly Deliver? A Comprehensive Review!,"**Tested Performance in Real-World Scenarios**

Using the AQUA CREST AQF-FF11B Refrigerator Water Filter in my everyday routine has been an insightful experience‚Äîseeing just how crucial a high-quality water filter can be. Touted as a reliable replacement for Samsung DA29-00003G and Aqua-Pure Plus models, among others, this product brings an impressive combination of ease of use, excellent filtration, and thoughtful design. While setting it up, the precise engineering became apparent; it fit snugly into my Samsung RF267AERS without the slightest issue. Not being much of a DIY enthusiast, having a filter that essentially installs itself is such a relief.  

The installation stickers provided made tracking the replacement timeline so convenient‚Äîno more guessing when the filter needs changing. They've even recommended swapping it out after six months or 300 gallons of use, depending on water conditions, which seems realistic given my household size and usage. 

**Benefits**

- BPA-free and food-grade materials ensure safety.  
- Removes chlorine, sediments, and other impurities effectively.  
- Comes with helpful monthly install stickers to track usage easily.  
- Fits seamlessly into compatible refrigerator models.  

[Check AQUA CREST AQF-FF11B price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b01g4vyy3w/)

**How the Taste Transforms**

Before using this water filter, I didn't think much about how water could taste ""better."" But after a few weeks, the difference became unmistakable. The subtle chlorine flavor from tap water was gone, replaced with a cleaner, crisper taste. Even my picky niece, who usually refuses to drink water, asked for seconds! It‚Äôs not just about taste, of course. Knowing the water is filtered through a certified coconut shell carbon block that reduces heavy metals, THM, and VOCs is reassuring. I‚Äôve even noticed that my coffee and tea taste more natural, which I guess is because there are fewer impurities.

**Drawbacks**

- May not be as effective for extremely hard water areas.  
- Filter lifespan may vary significantly depending on local water quality.  

**Durability and Build Quality**

This product feels durable right out of the box. It‚Äôs lightweight yet strong, made from lead-free, BPA-free materials for added safety, which is independently backed by NSF 42 and NSF 372 certifications. The thoughtfully constructed housing ensures no leaks when operational, even during peak usage. One day, I didn‚Äôt align it perfectly while installing but was amazed that there were no drips‚Äîit‚Äôs forgiving if you‚Äôre not the most careful person. 

However, the lifespan of the filter could be improved in areas with particularly hard water, as mine started lasting closer to five months. Living in a region where mineral deposits are common, this is something I need to account for. But even then, the changes in water quality made it worth the shorter replacement cycle.

**Pluses**

- Lightweight but highly durable.  
- Leak-proof design ensures no mess or water wastage.  
- Strong certification guarantees product safety and filtration claims.  

**Ease of Compatibility**

This wasn‚Äôt just tested in my fridge; I had some coworkers test it with their other compatible Samsung refrigerators, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. It seems like AQUA CREST has nailed the universal fit game. Be it models like RS257BARB or RF263AEBP, this filter seems to fit effortlessly. Its perfect compatibility removes the hassle of researching whether the filter will work with your exact model.

**Product Comparisons**

Comparing the AQUA CREST AQF-FF11B to other water filters like the Frigidaire ULTRAWF or Whirlpool EDR3RXD1 reveals some interesting contrasts. The former products are often pricier but might match AQUA CREST when it comes to basic filtration. However, AQUA CREST delivers this at better affordability, while also offering user-friendly installation stickers‚ÄîFrigidaire and Whirlpool skip that thoughtful detail. On the flip side, Whirlpool filters seemed to last slightly longer in homes with hard water, which could make a difference for people in water-stressed areas. AQUA CREST excels in providing cleaner-tasting water but can sometimes falter on the total lifespan in comparison.  

**Quality for Price**

This product strikes a solid price-to-quality ratio. Considering it arrives in a pack of three, you‚Äôre stocked up for about a year and a half (depending on usage). That kind of longevity matters for a busy household where replacements can become an annoying chore. Similar products often offer single replacements at a comparable price, so this pack provides great value. It's worth every penny if clean, reliable water is your top priority.

\---Decision---

¬†¬†

\---Tcakqaal‚Äôs perspective---

Just as I push off the railing on Deck 17, my ship cycles from diurnal to nocturnal, the illumination of the starboard gallery dimming significantly and allowing the ghostly light of the galactic core starfield to be visible as it streams down from the windowed ceiling above me.

I glide down to the balcony on the walkway of Deck 5, walk across it and beneath the handpainted Latin sign proclaiming this dorm a ‚ÄòLittle Deathworld‚Äô.

I‚Äôm pleased not to hear the invasive sounds of Terran music streaming out from the commonroom.

*Someone*‚Äô*s* managed to remember the privacy field, it seems(!)

Well, either that or they‚Äôve turned in early while I was finishing my administration?

The door slides open for me and I see it‚Äôs the former as most of the deathworlders and a few of the gardenworlders still aboard are revealed, watching a very peculiar sight with mirthful faces.

Twila has her right hand hinged back against her forearm, revealing a heat gun in her now demanated wrist.

She is directing the jet of warm air into a tunnel she‚Äôs presumably melted into the bottom of a \[50cm\] wide and \[30cm\] tall cylinder of opaque ice that rests on the coffee table.

As my head passes through the soundproof barrier that encloses this room, I hear the voice of a young Terran woman cheerfully singing  
¬†***f‚ô´‚Ä¶ound beneath my feet and rip hearts outta their cores!***  
***I wanna get stuck down in the deepest shit where the guts get raw and sore***  
***I wanna be melee infantry when they send me off to WA-AR!***

***Oh how I wanna big ol‚Äô hammer and be fightin‚Äô till the break of day!Let me run with the old boys like we‚Äôre chargin‚Äô with the Light Brigade!***  
***I wanna feel the heat of dead men‚Äôs breath and match the glory with a ro-o-oar!***  
***I wanna be melee infantry in the Orbital Corps!‚ô´f***  
to bassy, percussive music over the room‚Äôs speakers.

The smell of ethanol hangs thick on the air from the quantity of exposed Terran drinks.

A building *roar* of mostly Terran voices goes as Twila finishes excavating her tunnel and swings her hand back into its proper position before reaching for a short wooden pole.

She inserts it into the hole and pokes it through to the other side.

A **deafening** cheer goes up and drowns out the music as, emerging from the far side of the ice, comes a \[10cm\] metal cube with the Terran ‚ÄòC‚Äô glyph debossed into each of its faces.

My shipboard manager extends the actuated fingers of her elegant robotic hand to the block, picks it up and brings it to the top of the ice where I now notice just the top face of an identical metal block protruding from the surface, only with an ‚ÄòA‚Äô instead of a ‚ÄòC‚Äô on it‚Äôs face, placing it down exactly above it.

I‚Äôm able to use the height of the ice cylinder and my familiarity with the most common Terran script‚Äôs alphabet to infer the existence of an obscured ‚ÄòB‚Äô block.

The unnervingly raucous impacting of deathworld bodies as the crowd laughs and Twila sits down smugly next to her biological mother makes me glad I opted against bringing my daughter here tonight. Too high a risk of accident with *this* level of deathworld inebriation(!)

Jenny has a mixture of chagrin and amusement on her freckled face as Twila smugly folds her arms and the others goodnaturedly mock her (though, for *what*, I‚Äôm unable to discern).

I spot my Clansister over by the side of the room sitting on what is usually my perch.

She looks‚Ä¶ a *touch* uncomfortable but, regardless, I‚Äôm pleased she‚Äôs come and I‚Äôm pleased she‚Äôs been allowed into this space by its occupants.

One notable thing is how close she has allowed Fluffy to lie to the base of her perch.

I stride over to her.

‚ÄúGood evening, Waqa‚Äôarc.‚Äù I greet, pleasantly.

‚ÄúOh, good evening Sister.‚Äù she answers, distractedly.

Fluffy chuffs in reproach and I chitter ‚ÄúSorry Fluffy! I didn‚Äôt mean to leave you out.‚Äù extending my bionic talons (which she prefers to my natural ones) to scritch her front right shoulder.

Mollified, she begins emitting deep purrs and rolls against the wall, lifting her right legs to expose her underside to me.

Taking the cue, I transfer my scritching to the dark blue and black striped fur at her sternum.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what exactly *happened* to cause there to be a \[40L\] block of ice fused to the top of my ship‚Äôs furnishing over there, Sister?‚Äù I ask, mirthfully, as I give some much craved attention to my CSS‚Äôs companion animal.

Waqa‚Äôarc frowns, looking over at the crowd we‚Äôre separated from.

‚ÄúA little while ago, Ms MacLeod was talking about early Terran VIs, called ‚ÄòAI‚Äôs at the time but not capable of true sentience, just effective predictors of how Human‚Äôs generally structured sentences and only capable of getting things right if they had been trained on correct information (which had usually been stolen by the very wealthy individuals who were apparently funding their development, primarily because they thought it would allow them to dispense with the wages they were obliged to pay their Human workforce.) She then told us of the many questions you could ask these VIs which they would be incapable of answering, including this one‚Ä¶‚Äù she raises an alula to point to the block of ice ‚Äú‚Ä¶There are three cubes on a table, Block \[A\] rests on top of Block \[B\] which rests on top of Block \[C\]; how do you get the bottom block on top of the top block without touching or moving the top or middle blocks‚Ä¶ Apparently, this sounded enough like a Terran ‚Äòbrain teaser‚Äô to fool all of these VIs into thinking that there must *be* an answer and so none of them realised the problem they were being asked to solve was entirely *insoluble*. At that point‚Ä¶ Ms Twila volunteered that she thought there *was* a way to do it, just that it would only work if the blocks were made of a substance with a density significantly greater than \[1g/1cm^(3)\]‚Ä¶ You can *guess* the rest, I‚Äôm sure(!)‚Äù still frowning over with a look of mild perplexity adorning her face.

‚Äú*Well*‚Ä¶‚Äù I smile, hopping up onto Fluffy‚Äôs side for a better scritching angle while looking over at the crowd ‚Äú‚Ä¶my guess would be that a hearty debate ensued and crescendoed in a *challenge* being issued which Twila just won and Jenny just lost?‚Äù

‚Äú*Plucked* the okla midfall.‚Äù she confirms ‚ÄúAs I would expect, Sister.‚Äù

At this point, I see Victor noticing my presence, his emerald green eyes fixing on me from across the room for a brief moment before he excuses himself and begin making his way over to where I stand.

As he approaches, his forward facing eyes briefly flick to my Clansister as he politely acknowledges ‚ÄúOfc Waqa‚Äôarc.‚Äù with a nod.

‚ÄúCSS Taylor.‚Äù she acknowledges in return with a slightly too formal dip of her head.

Without further ado, my daughter‚Äôs \[godfather\] returns his attention to me and says ‚ÄúHey Cap, glad you made it. Can I have a quick word with you in my room please?‚Äù his tone serious but not urgent.

‚ÄúOf *course*, Victor. Please lead *on*.‚Äù I agree, extending a wing to the commonroom door.

He turn and walks away, myself following after.

At the point I‚Äôm just about to pass through the privacy field, I jump out of my feathers due to Fluffy appearing on my right.

Intentionally or unintentionally, she managed to approach me in the very narrow blindspot directly behind my head and, because every aspect of her physiology is perfectly optimised for stealth, I didn‚Äôt hear her following.

The music falls immediately silent as I pass back into the hallway.

Fluffy overtakes me and falls in at her master‚Äôs right side.

Without turning his head Victor extends a hand to the top of hers, between her ears.

He turns into the room he used to primarily occupy but now serves mainly as Fluffy‚Äôs room, gunlocker and cuddle puddle venue.

He breaks from Fluffy‚Äôs side to fetch a heavy perch it would take multiple R‚Äôqali to lift.

Onehandedly, he picks it up and walks across the room to place it beside where Fluffy has lain down in front of his weapons locker.

I walk to it and hop up facing where I know he‚Äôll be sitting.

Victor comes down on the floor between his pet‚Äôs front and middle legs, leaning against her torso and using her as a seatback.

I have a brief flash of him, sat on the floor with his pet hypercarnivore and in front of a rack of weapons, as a successful warlord from Ancient Earth.

It would be amusing enough to *laugh* at‚Ä¶ except that I know what he will have asked me here to talk about‚Ä¶

Taking Fluffy‚Äôs stubby front leg in his hands and running his fingers through her fur, he starts ‚ÄúCap, I-‚Äù but I cut him off.

‚ÄúVictor, *I* wish to speak first‚Ä¶‚Äù I state, firmly.

His copper eyebrows tilt upward in the middle to convey mild surprise but he raises a hand to gesture me to go ahead.

I take a deep breath and begin ‚ÄúVictor, I know that you have been grappling with the question of whether to retire from this line of work since the incident on Prosperity. I know that everything that that woman did to you was extremely traumatic, that, being a man of **such** *agency*, having your control and ownership of yourself stripped away must have been a nightmare! I know this‚Ä¶ but I also do **not** wish to *part* with you Victor‚Ä¶ So, I have devised a compromise‚Ä¶‚Äù

The man cocks an eyebrow and asks ‚ÄúA‚Ä¶ *compromise*?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I say, my hearts beating at \[1000rpm\] ‚ÄúVictor, what would you say to a position on the Bridge?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe‚Ä¶ *Bridge*?‚Äù he frowns in confusion ‚ÄúDoin‚Äô *what*?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure there will be *many* tasks I can find for you to take care of, Victor‚Ä¶‚Äù a slight twinge of desperation creeping into my voice ‚Äú‚Ä¶deathworld analysis, for instance? Or remote mission overseeing? If you want to be more useful I‚Äôd be happy to provide training in any task that took your fancy that you aren‚Äôt already qualified for‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúCap, I-‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Of **course**, if that offer isn‚Äôt to your liking I could grant you an extended sabbatical and allow you to rent this room at a cost of one credit per 50 diurnals, just to make the whole arrangement legal and official? You could take some time notworking to consider things andthinkaboutwhetheryou want to continue in this roleand,ofcourse,ifyoudoyou‚ÄôdbewelcomebackanytimeandifnotI‚Äôdhappily-‚Äù

Victor throws up his palm, firmly stopping me.

My chest rises and falls rapidly with shallow, panted breaths.

‚Äú*Breathe*, Cap‚Ä¶ Slow and **deep**!‚Äù he instructs, firmly.

I waggle my beak in a breathless Terran nod and consciously moderate my breathing.

When he‚Äôs satisfied that I‚Äôve sufficiently calmed down, Victor says ‚ÄúCap, I really **appreciate** it‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm really *touched*‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve been stressin‚Äô out about this, I didn‚Äôt realise‚Ä¶ Your ideas were good‚Ä¶ well, not ‚Äò*good*‚Äô exactly‚Ä¶ but they were definitely *thoughtful*‚Ä¶ I actually wanted to tell you I‚Äôve made up my mind‚Ä¶‚Äù

Oh, **Titan**!‚Ä¶ There was never any *hope* of enticing him to stay, *was* there?

‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm *stayin*‚Äô, Cap‚Ä¶‚Äù

It takes me several long moments to break from my stupor to ask ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ *sorry*?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm stayin‚Äô.‚Äù he repeats, simply.

I stare down at him, blankly, while numerous questions swirl in my mind. None make it to my beak.

‚ÄúIt was the break.‚Äù he explains ‚ÄúBein‚Äô on Citadel with nothin‚Äô much to do while we was waitin‚Äô for Parliament to decide if Khr‚Äôkowan and Viig got to stay there or we had to take ‚Äôem home? It made not even three months feel like more than **six**(!)‚Ä¶ I realised, that‚Äôs what my *life*‚Äô*d* be if I wasn‚Äôt workin‚Äô‚Ä¶ I also realised whoever you got to replace me (not to sound *arrogant* but) probably wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near as *good*(!) That‚Äôd put *them* at risk, the ship at risk and all my friends still aboard it at risk. I *also* also realised that I‚Äôd be draggin‚Äô Tuun away from a career she worked **hard** for and that didn‚Äôt sit right. Then, course, I realised I‚Äôd not get to see everyone aboard without specific‚Äôly arrangin‚Äô a holochat‚Ä¶ Your compromises‚Äôd‚Äôve fixed *some* o‚Äô those issues but not *all* of ‚Äôem‚Ä¶ Anyway, I talked it over with Ally and (*separate*) with Tuun and I decided to stay‚Ä¶ After our honeymoon, I‚Äôd like to request a full renewal of my employment contract and return to duty and my position if that‚Äôs alright?‚Äù

Unable to believe how well this went, my beak flaps open and closed a few times before I manage ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs *fine*, Victor‚Ä¶ **More** than fine! I‚Äôll *gladly* renew your employment!‚Äù

I hop down from my perch and make for the door.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll draw it up right now and I‚Äôll‚Ä¶‚Äù

The man is between me and the door before I reach it, wryly looking down at me.

‚ÄúNo you *won*‚Äô*t*‚Ä¶‚Äù he chides ‚Äú‚Ä¶Your *mental* if you think I‚Äôm lettin‚Äô you go back to work **this** late(!) You‚Äôre comin‚Äô back to the party and that *ain*‚Äô*t* up for discussion(!)‚Äù

\---later---

I stumble across my quarter‚Äôs threshold, inebriated on dilute Terran wine, and see my daughter excitedly waddling towards me on her adorable oversized legs.

‚ÄúKicakicakica!‚Äù she screeches.

‚Äú*Well* now(!) What are *you* doing awake, little one(?)‚Äù I chitter as I extend my natural talons to catch her front and raise her to mine.

I wrap my wings around her and tap my beak against hers. She responds with heartsmelting overenthusiasm, whacking the side of her beak into mine as hard as she‚Äôs able (only stopped from being *painful* by her diminutive size(!))

My lifemate appears (looking exhausted) and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm *sorry* Tcakqaal, she *just* won‚Äôt go up!‚Äù gesturing to the baby perch we moved her to once she outgrew the incubator.

‚ÄúNo matter, sweetfruit‚Ä¶ We can let her tire herself out for a little and then offer her the perch again‚Ä¶ *Can*‚Äô*t* we Tcakak!‚Äù I say, playfully nipping her with my beak while she squeaks in delight.

Once I‚Äôve stopped, she looks up at me and demands ‚ÄúAnka Viikta‚Ä¶ Play! Walk Anka Viikta!‚Äù

‚Äú\[Uncle\] Victor‚Äôs sleeping right now, little one‚Ä¶ But you can play with him tomorrow‚Ä¶ and the next day‚Ä¶ and the *next* day‚Ä¶‚Äù

I tried putting my moka pot on medium gas stove heat without tampering the grinds (no pressing it down) but didn't try a lot to even it out and when the coffee starts coming out, I take it off but it stops outright, so I have to put it back on. While coffee does come out properly, it doesn't fully bring out two cups to the point I need to pour it into the cup and then put it back on the heat to get the rest of it, and then it starts sputtering trying to do it. I think I used a setting of 15 on a Baratza Encore ESP as a starting point.

Another attempt I tried putting coffee in and this time, I tried to even the grinds out but still no tampering, and the grinds themselves were slightly more coarser. But when coffee starts coming out, it sputters first thing in. And it still immediately stops after I take it off the heat.

The big question is can I get some advice on how to brew more properly with a moka pot?",1,1753551172.0,mokapot,3,1.0,False

I (33m) have known this colleague (30f) for about a year now. Since she joined a year back, but we don't know each other too well, last year we had spoken a couple of times at events where she initiated (she's very outgoing and friendly so I just interpreted as that, that it's just a personality thing) but just very casually (for context we work in different departments in our company and I'm based out of Albany whereas she's in Manhattan, (where our HQ is).

So this year, we get a cross-department presentation together in May (just the two of us) and went really and we were able to get to know each other quite as well, which was really cool and after she became more touchy, which was previously not at all the case. The next week I had to come over to Manhattan for this two-day event the company was holding and she went out of her way to come and see me when we were in groups, the second time was literally just a hello as we had to take our seats for the conference, so I mentioned we should have a coffee the next week as we had missed out on meeting up. 

This meet up was the first 1:1 interaction we had and seemed pretty formal, but was a nice session. That day, our boss mentioned that we need to do a debriefing of our cross-department presentation where we needed to also evaluation each other's performances. After I had written up my evaluation, she immediately wrote me back and seemed genuinely happy and had mentioned how touched she was and invited me to this afterwork event that was going on, so I obliged but it was more of a social event so we spoke amongst multiple people, before I had to jet out to check-in to my hotel. 

A month later at another event when we saw each other, things were a bit different, she seemed a bit shy and awkward and during the even she was standing very close by and normally due to her outgoing nature she would initiate conversations, but she seemed reserved so I initiated the conversation this time and again it went well, but she seemed a bit awkward when speaking. 

Finally, a couple of weeks back we saw each other again during office hours, but this time she seemed much more confident when we spoke briefly. Then during the event we had held, we didn't speak at all initially and just as I was about to leave she came over and was very playful in getting my attention (tap on the shoulder) and when we spoke she was touchy again (just to add, I haven't noticed her being touchy and playful with other guys), before some people came into join our conversation at which point I really had to go as I had a dinner appointment with my mom in the city. 

So I felt that maybe she's just friendly, but would like to know what you guys think of this?",1,1753550986.0,bodylanguage,3,1.0,False

To an extent where I felt to giveup, I made a DSH attempt by overdosing newcita lite. From then on my psychiatrists kept increasing my sertaline dose to 50 mg, 37.5 mg but it made me too much zombie and sleepy. I can't afford that as I am professional student and have exams which require atleast 6-7 hrs of consistent study everyday. I kept switching back to my regular doses of sertaline 25 mg and provanol but still being on meds my panic attacks aren't stopping. I feel headache, nausea, chest pain, semi consciousness, drooping eyes and feel like my BP is falling (we sort of knowledge right that we are going to have panic attack). 

Yesterday I had come and bang! I had an instant panic attack. Now I a have started avoid even tea (coffee is a nightmare) . I feel unsafe everywhere except for home (unable to stay still in library as I keep feeling uneasy). 

I am very young and have to experience soo many things but all this makes me feel like a person chained in a dark room with food and water. Like I have been caged and even if I can free myself I can't. 

Pls reply what is this, what should I do? Is it not only an anxiety disorder/ depression and maybe more like adhd, autism (sorry I don't know their symptoms and if I have hurt someone's feeling) but I don't know what should I do, even my parents are sort of frustrated like what's happening to our daughter and why can't a medicine fix it.

PE 20, Dividend 2% Buybacks 4.2%.  Huge TAM.  Still growing quickly as compared to Western Fast Food co's.  I estimate long term operating income growth at 7% for the next 10 years.  Its a safer way to play the Chinese stock market.

¬†Yum China was spun off from the U.S.-based Yum! Brands in 2016 and is publicly traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and Hong Kong Stock Exchange. YUMC operates over 10,600 restaurants in more than 1,100 cities across mainland China, making it one of the largest restaurant companies in the world. Its portfolio includes well-known Western brands such as KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, along with Chinese dining and specialty coffee brands like Little Sheep, Huang Ji Huang, East Dawning, and COFFii & JOY, as well as partnerships with Lavazza.

KFC is the largest quick-service restaurant brand in China, and Pizza Hut is a leading Western casual dining chain. Yum China localizes its menu significantly to suit Chinese tastes, offering items like rice dishes and congees alongside signature fried chicken. The company directly owns and operates about 85% of its restaurants, with the rest franchised, serving customers through dine-in, delivery, and takeaway. With revenues around US$9.5 billion and a workforce of over 450,000, Yum China opened its first KFC in China in 1987 and Pizza Hut in 1990, introducing Taco Bell in Shanghai in 2016. Yum China holds exclusive rights to operate and sub-license KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell in mainland China and has expanded some brands internationally. Overall, Yum China is a leading force in China‚Äôs evolving food service sector, blending global brand recognition with strong local adaptation. YUMC has the scale to be aggressive on pricing; that provide customers greater access via robust digital ordering, delivery, and drive-thru options; and that has a healthy balance sheet.",6,1753550898.0,ValueInvesting,0,0.88,False
1m9z3x6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1m9z3x6/explore_if_the_lifestraw_home_dispenser_water/,Explore if the LifeStraw Home Dispenser water filter truly delivers clean water review,"The LifeStraw LSH18DSWH31 Home Dispenser Water Filter is something I‚Äôve gotten to know quite well in my space. It‚Äôs not every day that I find a product blending sleek design with eco-friendliness so effortlessly, but this water filter dispenser checks so many boxes that it quickly became a staple in my kitchen. Billed as the only water filter dispenser that removes bacteria, parasites, lead, and over 30 other contaminants, I was incredibly curious to see if it lived up to the hype. Spoiler alert‚Äîit almost does, with a few minor quirks.

**Stylish and Practical Design**  
Right out of the box, I was struck by its compact and modern design. Fitting easily into my refrigerator or sitting pretty on the countertop, its white BPA-free plastic exterior looks polished without feeling fragile. The one-hand tap feature also stood out to me‚Äîno more awkwardly tilting pitchers midway through filling a glass of water. It also has an easy-fill lid, which streamlines refilling and minimizes spillage. Plus, at just 2.6 pounds, moving it around is effortless. While it looks stylish, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs small enough for tight spaces or minimalistic kitchens without some adjustments.

**Key Benefits**  
- Removes bacteria, parasites, and microplastics that similar products don‚Äôt address.  
- Reduces lead, mercury, and PFAS (""forever chemicals"") while improving water clarity.  
- Retains essential minerals like magnesium and potassium for added health benefits.  
- Convenient filtration lifespan: 264 gallons for the microfilter and 40 gallons for the carbon filter.  

**Performance and Filtration**  
Let me just say, the filtration on this thing is no joke. Living in an area where tap water can taste... let‚Äôs just say questionable at times, I immediately noticed an improvement. The water tastes crisp, clean, and just better overall. Knowing it removes things like chlorine and pesticides also put my mind at ease, especially when making baby formula for my niece or using it for coffee. My partner, who‚Äôs very picky about water taste, instantly signed off on this as ‚Äúdrink-worthy.‚Äù However, the filters need replacing every couple of months, so keep that recurring cost in mind if you're on a strict budget.

[Find the best price for LifeStraw LSH18DSWH31 on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b093lpt5m1/)

**Who Is It For?**  
If you‚Äôre someone conscious about reducing single-use plastics, this dispenser indirectly contributes to sustainability by cutting down reliance on bottled water. Families with kids or anyone living in areas with iffy water quality stand to benefit the most, but it‚Äôs also a pretty smart buy for urban professionals who value both convenience and health. It‚Äôs less suited for those who prefer a more compact personal water filtration system, as this one is firmly in household territory.

**Drawbacks**  
- Bulky for small apartments or low-fridge shelves.  
- Carbon filter replacement frequency means ongoing maintenance costs.  
- The tap operates smoothly, but it drips slightly if not shut properly.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to its competitors like the Brita Everyday Pitcher or the ZeroWater Filter Pitcher, the LifeStraw Home Dispenser pushes ahead in terms of filtration thoroughness. Most comparable devices don‚Äôt touch bacteria or parasites, whereas this one excels there. The Brita system is lighter on filtration but wins for affordability and filter availability. ZeroWater, meanwhile, offers similarly advanced filtration but often falls slightly short in retaining essential minerals like the LifeStraw system does. If you value taste, the LifeStraw and ZeroWater options are neck and neck, but the LifeStraw‚Äôs eco-conscious and social impact edge can‚Äôt be ignored.

**Quality for Price**  
This product sits at a higher price tier compared to generic alternatives, but it offers more peace of mind, especially considering the health gains. While an upfront investment might make some pause, the yearly filter lifespan and quality of the water justify it. Plus, the added benefit of providing a year of safe water to a child in need through your purchase takes the value proposition to a more global scale.

Whether you‚Äôre fueling a team at the office or just savoring a solo cup before diving into emails, this machine promises to deliver a convenient and customizable coffee experience. I‚Äôve been using it daily for a few months now, and while I appreciate what it brings to the table, there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Let‚Äôs start with how this coffee maker looks. The sleek and modern silver design with its metallic finish makes it a statement piece in my kitchen. It has a professional vibe that I can see fitting seamlessly into any office break room or personal counter space. Compact yet solid, it feels durable without being overly heavy (weighing just six pounds). On my counter, it doesn‚Äôt take up much space with dimensions of 10.38"" D x 14"" W x 13.8"" H, making it perfect for smaller areas. The build quality feels premium, and I particularly appreciate the touchscreen interface that adds a touch of elegance while keeping things user-friendly.

**Features and Usability**  
The big draw for me is its customizable settings. The touchscreen interface is not just for show; it allows you to adjust the brewing temperature, program it to turn on or off automatically, and even switch between English, Spanish, or French. My mornings feel sophisticated with this high-tech setup! The brewer has a massive 90-ounce removable water reservoir which means I don't have to refill it frequently‚Äîit holds water for up to 18 cups. I typically brew two cups each day, and this feature alone has saved me loads of time and effort.

**Added Convenience**  
I love how versatile this machine is. It accommodates four different brew sizes: 4 oz., 6 oz., 8 oz., and 10 oz. Whether I‚Äôm craving a strong 4-oz shot of pure energy or a full 10-oz cup to sip at my desk, there‚Äôs an option for everyone. The option to drain and store the machine makes it easier to transport‚Äîthis is especially useful if you‚Äôre using it in seasonal spaces like a vacation home or for events. If you‚Äôre lazy like me, the pour-over design removes the hassle of plumbing and installation. This little detail makes it more practical than other machines tied to fixed water lines.

**[Ready to snag Keurig K155 Office Pro Commercial? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b00dwkehu4/)**  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
I have to admit, this coffee maker churns out consistently good cups of coffee, tea, and even hot cocoa. The brewing process takes less than a minute, which makes it seem like caffeine appears out of thin air to banish morning grogginess. The coffee temperature is adjustable, so no one‚Äôs stuck with lukewarm disappointment. I‚Äôve also noticed that the reusable filter option is less wasteful and great for those who don‚Äôt want to keep buying disposable pods. The only downside is you won‚Äôt get caf√©-quality espresso here‚Äîit‚Äôs mainly tailored for standard coffee.

**Advantages**  
- Large 90-oz water reservoir minimizes frequent refills.  
- Four brew size options ensure variety for individual preferences.  
- Elegant touchscreen interface makes it easy to program and navigate.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Brew temperature range could be wider for those who take their coffee scalding hot.  
- Doesn‚Äôt produce espresso-level crema, which might disappoint fans of stronger coffee.  

**Ease of Maintenance**  
Cleaning the Keurig K155 is straightforward, and I‚Äôm thankful for that. The removable water tank and drip tray make cleanup less of a chore. Descaling the machine every three months is recommended, which is about standard for any coffee maker, though it‚Äôs something I occasionally forget to do! The option to drain the water from the hot tank is a unique feature that adds to its portability and easy maintenance. For an office setting with high usage levels, this will definitely come in handy.

**Competing Products**  
I‚Äôve used similar single-serve brewers like the Nespresso Essenza Mini and the Cuisinart SS-10. While the Nespresso excels in espresso brewing and compactness, it lacks the larger water capacity and versatility of the Keurig K155. The Cuisinart is comparable regarding removable water reservoirs but feels bulkier and doesn‚Äôt offer the elegant touchscreen experience. With the Keurig K155, the edge comes from its balance of performance and professional design, which puts it in a sweet spot for both offices and homes.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering its sturdy build and array of features like programmable settings, a reusable filter, and a large water tank, I‚Äôd say this coffee maker offers solid value for its price range. It caters to coffee, tea, and hot cocoa lovers alike, bridging the gap between convenience and customization. Sure, it‚Äôs not the cheapest option out there, but if you think about how much you‚Äôd spend on daily trips to a coffee shop, this appliance justifies itself pretty fast over time.

1m9z1qu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1m9z1qu/challenge_of_having_hyperthymic_temperament_and/,Challenge of having hyperthymic temperament and being BP1 is knowing when stable crosses into hypomania.,"I‚Äôve been stable for a couple months now after a brief depressive episode that we managed with increasing my lexapro and lowering my Risperidone. I was diagnosed BP1 about 17 years ago but my default personality/mood is high functioning and goal oriented and it looks like hypomania despite being fully stable and sane. 

I basically have the ‚ÄúCEO‚Äôs disease‚Äù bipolar and am a highly compensated corporate attorney. My hypomanic episodes look like I‚Äôm on crack though and my manic episodes look like I‚Äôm very ill and can be euphoric but also paranoid and psychotic. But I typically manage the upswings well and keep it from getting too extreme. I mostly just look energetic and upbeat and personable. 

A few weeks ago I got back into running for the first time since my surgery at the end of March and am back doing marathon training. I was running 4 days a week and lifting 3 days a week before that surgery. I also noticed tons of motivation and goal oriented thinking and behavior as well which had diminished with the depression. Also increased religiosity (church every Sunday; increased frequency of praying; bought a new Bible). 

This week I started to wake up early without reason which is always a sign of things changing with my mood. Yesterday I woke up at 4am and just didn‚Äôt feel like sleeping any more so I got up and had coffee and waited for my kids to wake up. Another sign of change (not sleeping because you don‚Äôt *feel* like sleeping). Today I made myself go back to sleep. 

I think a big part of it is that I just finished a job search and my last day of my current role was yesterday. So the relief and the change is probably impacting my mood. But because it‚Äôs hard to differentiate between my normal, non-depressed state and hypomania, I have to just pay attention so that we can adjust the lexapro downwards and/or Risperidone upwards if necessary. 

My wife and mom have already commented on these changes independently and I am open with them. I booked extra therapy sessions (weekly now) and even had a Saturday session today as well. I plan on channeling the energy in a healthy and productive way by focusing on my health, fitness, family, faith, and new job, while maintaining balance to the best of my ability.

I started on this path at 18 in college and have felt like I have no other option. But I am good at it and have worked my way up.

Earlier this week I had a mental breakdown because I truly hate it so much. I love the steady check, benefits, working from home. But I loathe the corporate space. Work feels meaningless, I‚Äôm on a computer all day, it‚Äôs stressful and unfulfilling and this company has made questionable decisions in terms of ethics.

I‚Äôve found a program I can go into that works with animals and would allow me to start my own business. It would also be flexible for the future when we have kids. Working with animals is something I‚Äôm passionate about and do in my spare time as much as possible. The trade school is about 6 months plus testing. I‚Äôm fortunate to have a husband that supports this change as it will be a pay cut, especially for the first couple of years.

I can‚Äôt help but doubt myself ‚Äî I feel guilty going back to school and giving up this corporate job that‚Äôs given financial stability. It feels like a step backwards. Would it be embarrassing at 30 to say I‚Äôm totally changing careers and working at something like a coffee shop part time while I build up clientele? It just feels like there is this stigma and I‚Äôm having a hard time getting over that. Looking for some validation I guess. üò≠

1m9z1mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1m9z1mc/ive_been_struggling_to_get_a_job_after_losing_my/,I‚Äôve been struggling to get a job after losing my career,"I‚Äôm a former EMT. I worked for a local ambulance company in my town, it‚Äôs also the only ambulance company within almost a 70 mile radius as it‚Äôs owned by our region‚Äôs hospital. This hospital owns almost everything medical in our area, and after being terminated, I‚Äôve been put on a ban list. 

For background, I was wrongfully terminated by a hate parade fueled by a supervisor who wanted me gone. My partner and I stopped at a Starbucks next to our station because he put his mobile order in. We were being told by dispatch we needed to go to a different zone, however he asked that we stop anyways. I said sure. Well he waited on his drink to be made, I talked to my aunt who was manger at the store. After us being there a few minutes we received an ‚Äúalpha‚Äù (No lights/Sirens) emergency call 45 seconds away from the Starbucks. 

My partner proceeded to continue waiting on his drink a couple of minutes, then he left to the truck. I was giving my aunt a hug and then grabbing my drink she made for me and walking out when my partner came to the door and told me we were put out of service and had to go see a supervisor. 

Basically, he told dispatch that we were going to be delayed longer because I was waiting on coffee. ( I don‚Äôt even drink coffee but that‚Äôs not the point ) when I got to the station my supervisor sent my partner away and belittled me for everything she could think of. 

I was sent home. Then placed on suspension that afternoon because they were opening an ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù on my patient care abilities. You‚Äôre supposed to still receive pay while on suspension, I didn‚Äôt. 

The suspension came as a surprise because she told my partner I was free to return to work the following Sunday. ( My next scheduled shift ) My partner - A paramedic, despite telling her he was also waiting on his drink, was not fired, suspended or written up. 

I was brought in the following Monday where I was told by the CCO that I was equal to a killer in his eyes, and that he knows it‚Äôs common for people to take a minute to get in their trucks .. but I was caught, so he‚Äôs making an example out of me. 

My supervisor told both him and the head of HR that my partner came to tell me we were out of service and I said quote ‚ÄúIt can wait until I get my drink‚Äù 

This, I never said so I said ‚Äúhuh??  I never said that?‚Äù She then proceeded to yell over me and call me a liar. She then told me it was on footage. I said show me. She got quiet. Any HR rep said they found that to be the most disgusting part of my ‚Äúact‚Äù

I told the HR rep I‚Äôm a nursing student and asked if she could check if that means I‚Äôll be unable to participate in clinicals at the hospital. 

She said she‚Äôd call and find out for me. 

I never heard from anyone again after walking out of that building. I brought in my uniforms 3 days later and my HR rep said ‚ÄúOh I saw your email, don‚Äôt worry. Not ignoring you. I‚Äôm just so busy with new hires and orientation. You know how that goes..‚Äù 

I had to get out before I started sobbing so I left. I never received a termination letter or anything. 

I emailed HR, CCO, CEO basically telling them how deeply sorry I was and how I felt this was such an unjust punishment. Considering my partner and I‚Äôd never had a single write up or disciplinary before. I had nothing but good things said about me from patients and other staff..

I just don‚Äôt know what to do or where to go from here. I don‚Äôt want to hate healthcare because of this but it‚Äôs been 6 months and no where in healthcare will give me a chance. 

I can‚Äôt afford to move and I can‚Äôt drive 70 miles to another ambulance service. I feel so depressed, hopeless and empty without my job. It sucks to know my HR knew I was battling cancer, was offered leave but didn‚Äôt take it. They knew I wanted this job more than anything. 

I‚Äôd just gone back to get my advanced EMT. When I told them that all they cared about was if they helped pay for it. 

If anyone has any advice. Please give it to me. 

I‚Äôm just lost without a map. 

Edit; I‚Äôd also like to add. I was replaced before I was even officially terminated. Typically spots go up for bids for employees with seniority to bid on.  Mine didn‚Äôt even make it there. When I was returning my uniforms they were talking on the phone ‚ÄúOh here john (fake name) comes in now. (Ohh.. never mind just Grace‚Äù

Well, the thing is, even if you get a better(!) paying job, its not a great amount compared to effort you put into that job.

Rents are high, buying a car? Who tf are you lil bro. You gotta pay crazy amount of taxes to get a shitty car which will broke down in the middle of road. You want to socialise? Absolutely nonsense. Why would i pay 5 dollars for a fucking cup of coffee when the minimum wage is 545 dollars?

This time, she's planning a trendy caf√© bash for a sweet kid turning 12. But as usual, the guest list has gone missing in her avalanche of sticky notes! Help Yvonne figure out who's coming to the party this time! (Game 2/7, today's my birthday :])

**Birthday Party Two:**

A much bigger party than the last, the youngest of large Mangrove family is celebrating her first birthday-in the way 1 year olds do. As per tradition, the overwhelming majority of the family is invited, plus some friends. The guest list is packed, with a whopping 40 people coming in total! These are the people/families coming:

Group 1. The one-year-old, Emilia Cate Mangrove's immediate family consists of two parents, one older brother, and three older sisters. Her parents have the masculine and feminine versions of two fairly long names as first names. Her father has a generally common middle name beginning in 'L', and her mother has a more classy and elegant middle name. All of her siblings have slightly match-y Hispanic first names, and middle names following a nature theme. They all have the surname Mangrove (mother's nee; Torez.)

Group 2. Emilia's grandparents from both sides are attending the celebration as well! On her father's side, her grand-dad has a popular German name, and his middle name is a word. He and his wife, whose first name begins with 'R' and middle name ends in 'Y', share the surname Mangrove. Emilia's Pop and Nan from her mother's side, however, are divorced and have different surnames. Her Pop's first and middle names are diminutives, and his surname has something to do with a colour. He also has a wife 'Grams', who's first name was in the top 50 names during 1923 (You choose where it's based off of), and last name was changed to Pop's. Her Nan also has a fianc√©e 'Grampa', a tall but nervous man with a English first and middle name. His last name is Scottish. Nan's first name begins in 'O' and was trendy in her birth year, but outside of the top 100 names. Her middle name is a filler, and her last name ends in 'K'

Group 3. The family of Emilia's oldest uncle is small, but very lively and fun to be around. Her uncle, Mr. DJ Torez, uses DJ as his first name because he doesn't love his legal one (his initials are DJT). His husband has a first name that was especially popular in 2023, with a positive association, and his middle name is medium-length and heavy on vowels. Their daughter was named after the couple's favourite female singer, and her middle name is similar to her Nan's in some way.

Group 4. The second eldest of the Torez siblings is a bit different from DJ's‚Äîmuch bigger. He and his wife have 9 kids, all with first names that follow a sound-based theme, and middle names that are a bit trajik (ranging from Ruith to Kryistoffepherre). The father is a junior, as is one of his children‚Äîthe only one that defies to theme. His wife has a soft first name and a longer, hyper-feminine middle name, and shares the Torez surname like the rest of the family.

Group 5. Emilia's only aunt and the youngest of the 4 siblings is not married, nor does she have kids. However, she does plan to bring her new boyfriend to meet the large family! Her first name has something to do with weather, and her middle name is Spanish. Her boyfriend has a first name that was very in in the 1970s, and a middle name that correlates to a rock band. His last name is short and somewhat common.

Group 6. The cool (and cocky) uncle on Emilia's father's side, Dr. Mangrove will be attending the event as well. Bringing his wife, a sweet Mexican woman with a first + middle name that reflects her heritage, and their son, a sporty and slightly spoiled boy, they're almost guaranteed to get there late and equipped with a long story of why. Dr. Mangrove's first name starting with 'B', his middle with 'P', and both names were common in his birth year. His son has his mother's initials, but a completely different sounding full name.

Group 7. Grams's own daughter, or Emilia's step-aunt, has been married for a long time. Her coming would only be her 2nd time meeting the family, and her husband + kids first. She has a Portuguese first name and a floral middle name, and changed her last name to Talkins after marriage. Her husband, who goes by a nickname/diminutive of his first name, has a middle name with a long meaning. They have 3 kids, ages 21, 17, and 4‚Äîtwo girls and a boy. Their eldest first name is feminized from her father's, and her middle name is the same as her Grams's. Their son, the 17 year old, has a first name that was super popular in 2008, and an Irish middle name. Their 4 year old's name is soft, sweet, and has been consistently unpopular for multiple decades.

I had woken up to my usual alarm. It is Monday morning and I had to get ready to get back to work. I had spent the last week doing a marathon of League of Legends in my basement and didn‚Äôt leave the house during that period. I dedicated myself to spend my staycation grinding to make it to platinum. Unfortunately I was not able to make it, I needed more time. Granted my job is a stay at home job as customer service. Just answering calls and helping people online. That being said, my routine is pretty simple. I wake up, brush my teeth, make breakfast, take Lola for a walk, clock in for my job, and finally spend the rest of the day on League. Yeah I know what an amazing life but today it all changed.

As I brushed my teeth I had an odd feeling. As if something was off. I mean I had just spent the last week playing non-stop League so it could just be that my body is just trying to get back to the routine. When I say I was doing a marathon I was doing a **marathon**. I avoided all outside distractions. Even Lisa, the girl I met two weeks ago, I met her at a party and we really hit it off. I have to thank Dylan before I forget again. Maybe that's what I was feeling. But I don‚Äôt feel like that's it. I can't really put my finger on it. I stared at myself in the mirror. I have to admit I did look pretty rough, a bit pale. My hygiene was not in the best shape. Then I turned on the sink and when I splashed my face with some water I noticed the water didn‚Äôt feel right. I quickly stepped back a bit freaked out. I stared at the water coming out of the sink. It looked more cloudy. The texture of the water felt off. It felt thicker. I turned it off and on. I mean it looked like water. Maybe there was something going on with the pipes. I will have to call a plumber later. 

I checked the shower and the water was normal. Maybe it really was just the sink. I relaxed a bit with the idea that I can at least take a hot shower. I stood under the water just trying to relax my sense of unease. Something was bugging me. The disconnection of reality even for just a week can really have a toll on a person. Then mid shower the water cut off. Now I was just frustrated. I cleaned myself off and rushed downstairs into the basement to get a fresh set of clothes from the dryer. I angrily put on my clothes but before I went back up stairs from the corner of my eye. I noticed my washer. The opening was gone. I walked up to it for a closer look in disbelief. It was my washer but there was no opening. The door was completely gone. As if the washer was just a block of metal. Someone had to be messing with me. Dylan must have came in the middle of the night while I was knocked out and done this. He probably messed with my pipes too. This is all just some sick prank from him. I ran back upstairs and grabbed my phone. I had put my phone on don‚Äôt disturb for the whole week so I had a ton of notifications. I ignored them all to straight away text Dylan. The last conversation we had was the coordinations to the party.

**I saw your prank Dylan, It's kinda lame man. Come here and fix it.**

I breathed in and out. I had to calm down. This isn‚Äôt really a big deal. It does save me from having to call a plumber if this was just some prank. Such a lame prank honestly. But it is impressive since I didn‚Äôt hear it last night. Huh, I must have been really knocked out. Trying to stay on routine I headed to the kitchen to start breakfast. I placed the pot for coffee and got the eggs out of the fridge. I needed some background noise so I headed to the living room to turn on the tv to listen to the news of the day. When I turned it on I was met with static. I switched through channels and was met with nothing. If it wasn‚Äôt static it would just be a black screen.  What the hell is going on? Was this part of Dylan's prank?  I decided to just use my phone. I went on youtube and looked up my favorite podcast. But when I did I was just met with the spinning wheel of death. I had wifi bars. What was going on? I clicked to text Dylan.

**Dude what did you do?**

I checked and both text messages were sent. So at least those are going through. I clicked to text Lisa next to answer her messages.

**Hey it was nice meeting you at the party**

**Are you free this week?**

**Hello?**

I'm starting to think I took my staycation a little too far. Now I feel stupid. I was ready to text her an apology and some bullshit excuse. I can just say my phone was broken. But when I tried clicking the bar to type it wouldn‚Äôt let me. I tapped harder and harder but it wouldn‚Äôt budge. I started tapping every other part of my phone, home, back to the text app, youtube, back to home, it worked. It just didn‚Äôt let me text her. When I got back to the text app her chat bubble greyed out. I have never seen the app do that before. Does that mean she blocked me? I mean I wouldn‚Äôt blame her for it. I am such an idiot. But when I started to scroll down I saw all the other bubbles greyed out too. I couldn‚Äôt text them either. The only one not greyed out was Dylan. There is no way he messed with my phone too. Now I don't know how to feel. Anger, frustrated, stupid. Finally Dylan responded.

**Hey man, nice to hear from you after a week. I bet the staycation was great. Not sure what you mean by prank, what's going on?**

Now I was actually mad. He is playing this dumb act of not knowing what was going on. I responded quickly.

**You messed with my plumbing, replaced my washer, and did something to my wifi. Its not really funny Dylan, just come here and put it back to normal.**

I waited for a bit and he responded quickly.

**I have no idea what you are talking about dude. I'll come over to see what's going on.**

I was ready to respond back telling him he better but his chat bubble got greyed out too. Now I couldn‚Äôt text him. I tried calling but nothing. Instead the call will just drop immediately. Then it clicked in my head. I had forgotten about Lola. I started calling out for her. I immediately began to panic. She always greeted me in the morning but she didn‚Äôt today. I ran to check every room. I checked her bed that is usually kept in the corner of the living room. Nothing. She was gone. Now before you judge me I obviously still took care of Lola during my staycation. I literally saw her before bed. Maybe she got out during the night, I must have left a door open. I ran to the backyard patio door and that's when my heart sank. Outside I saw a giant blanket of fog covering the view of my backyard. It was thick and made it impossible to see anything pass it. I could only make out shapes but nothing of the details. I stood there in disbelief. I have never seen something like this. This just wasn‚Äôt any kind of ordinary fog. When I reached for the patio door it didn‚Äôt budge. I checked the lock and it was unlocked for sure. But the door wouldn‚Äôt budge. I pulled and pushed with all my strength and it wouldn‚Äôt budge an inch. I reached for the window and it wouldn‚Äôt budge either. Now the feeling of dredge was starting to really sink in. I ran to every corner of my house and every opening to the outside world wouldn‚Äôt budge. My breathing started to become erratic, I was feeling claustrophobic. My heart started to pound in my ears. I started to look around. There has to be an answer to what is going on. 

Then I noticed the eggs I took out this morning were gone. I opened the fridge to make sure I didn‚Äôt put them back in by accident but not just the eggs were missing but many food items were missing too. I shut the fridge in frustration and turned to the coffee machine only to see the pot sitting there. I smacked myself to snap into reason. Am I going crazy? I have to think of a reasonable explanation. But I feel like that only made me crazier. If things are going missing from this morning. That could only mean the person doing this to me‚Ä¶ Is in my house.

That is the only logical explanation. I don‚Äôt think this is Dylan. This is someone who is trying to torment me or worse. Well whoever this is they are stuck in here with me. The only problem is I didn‚Äôt want to go look for him. If it wanted to do harm to me, looking for him and potentially walking into its trap is exactly what it would want. I can‚Äôt explain the fog outside but at this point, the lengths it's gone to keep me trapped here, I can see it being part of its plan. But then again I realized the flaw of my thinking. I already checked every room in the house when I went looking for Lola. And no one came out to kill me. It could potentially be sitting in a closet waiting for me to open it to lunge out and kill me then. I was shaking at this point. Out of anger or fear I couldn‚Äôt tell you.

I opened my phone one more time for a hail mary. Then I noticed the notifications that I ignored earlier. There were multiple new emails, more than usual, and multiple with the important tag on them. When I opened my Inbox multiple emails had the subject as.

**Warning! 5 Days Left**

**Warning! 4 Days Left**

**Warning! 3 Days Left**

**Warning! 2 Days Left**

**Warning! Final Warning!**

I didn‚Äôt recognize the sender. The email was unrecognizable. It was a business email that's all I could put together. I couldn‚Äôt open the emails no matter how hard I pressed on the screen. How is it possible to be able to see my inbox but not be able to see or respond to my emails? But again nothing on my phone was making sense. I hadn‚Äôt received any new text messages. My last email was that final warning email. Now I truly feel like something bad is happening to me. Those subject titles from those emails were only making me more anxious. Could it be a warning from my captors, could I have prevented this if I only had checked my email once during my staycation. I tried calling 911 and every phone number on my phone and nothing worked. But instead of the call just dropping I instead was met with a female voice.

**‚ÄúYour features have been suspended for the time being‚Äù**

Then the call dropped. Shouldn‚Äôt it be services rather than features? I don‚Äôt know and honestly it was least of my concerns. I couldn‚Äôt call for emergency services. Then I remembered that Dylan said he was on his way. The best thing I can do now is to just wait for him to arrive. Thank god I was able to send that text message out. Dylan right now is my last hope in getting me out of this. I should wait in the living room until he arrives but as I walked into the living room it was empty. The furniture and even my tv were gone. Everything was gone. This wasn‚Äôt a person doing this, it was an entity, an anomaly, paranormal, this was something not from this world. The world as I know it was coming to an end. My world. Things around my house are disappearing right before my very eyes. In desperation I grabbed a chair from the kitchen and threw it against the patio door. Didn‚Äôt budge. It is as if my house had become whole. The fog was still outside. Same as earlier. Then a shadow passed through the house.

I ran to the front door. The shadow of someone passing outside peered into the living room. But when I looked outside I couldn‚Äôt make out any details. I only saw the silhouette of someone but I couldn‚Äôt make out who it was. Then they walked away. Then someone else passed. I can make out the few feet in front of my house but I couldn‚Äôt see past the sidewalk. How are people walking in this fog? How could they even possibly see in it? Unless they weren‚Äôt human!? This must have been an alien takeover. It must have happened during my staycation and I was the only living thing that didn‚Äôt get kidnapped. But if an alien takeover did happen‚Ä¶ How was I talking to Dylan? Was I even talking to Dylan? Now I had too many questions and no answers. My head was spinning. I would sit on my couch but that was gone. 

Finally a bigger shadow peered through the window. The silhouette just stood in front of the entrance to my yard. They just stood there. Maybe it was Dylan. I started to pound at my window with every once of my strength. I yelled at the top of my lungs. I kept going until my hand started to really hurt and my knuckles started to bleed. Please Dylan. Please let it be you. But the silhouette did not budge. It stood there for a few more minutes. It looked like it was looking down, possibly a phone? I checked my phone but I didn‚Äôt get any new text messages instead the screen had turned black with a timer counting down from an hour. 

I fell to my knees and rolled into a ball. My dog is gone, my stuff is disappearing, as far as I know my world is ending or has already ended. All I can do is just sit here and do nothing but let whatever forces take me. I began to bawl my eyes out. The feeling of hopelessness washes over me. As I sat there my eye caught the reflection of a red light from one of the walls of my empty living room. It was coming from outside. It looked like it was moving or changing hues. I got up and looked outside. I didn‚Äôt see anything at first until I looked up at the angle the light was coming from and there floating in mid air. Big red text lighting the front of my house spelled.

Part of the event is the publication of an annual collection of short stories, written by people from our city or the surrounding area. People can submit their stories, after which a jury decides which ten to fifteen will be included in the collection, which then will be published citywide and excerpts are displayed publicly during the event. It‚Äôs a big deal locally.

I (25M) work as a librarian. Every year, someone from the library has to be present at the jury, and I was chosen for this year's jury.

One of my best friends (25F), whom I met at art school ten years ago, is taking a creative writing course in evening classes. The students submit a piece for the competition every year, and if your work is actually published, it gives you a lot of exposure as a writer, so most students take it very seriously. A few weeks ago, my friend and I met up for coffee. She told me she was stressed about finding a good storyline. I advised her to draw inspiration from her environment and offered to help if needed. I also jokingly said ""I'm on the jury this year, so don't worry, I've got your back.""

When I received the submissions (a few weeks before the jury meeting), I found her 5-page story about a man with a gambling addiction listing his possessions before potentially losing them. The writing was good, but I immediately recognized myself: the character had brown curly hair and glasses (like me), lived above a store (like me), and one of the items described was a souvenir from Laos, a country I visited this year and told her about during our last coffee meetup. The only difference was the gambling addiction - I collect figurines and occasionally play gacha games but manage my finances carefully.

I called her that evening. She confirmed the character was inspired by me, saying she followed my advice to ""keep it close to her world."" When I expressed concern about being linked to gambling addiction, she said ""It's creative nonfiction for a contest. People will know it's not true.""

I was worried. Our mutual friends, my boss, colleagues, and family would read this. The details clearly pointed to me, and rumors spread fast in our city. At the jury meeting, her story was praised as a ""strong candidate"" for its perspective on current issues. Panicking, I spent five minutes criticizing her story, convincing the jury to reject it. And it worked. We chose a different story instead.

She called later, expecting good news since she'd received positive peer feedback and I'd promised support. When I explained my decision, she was furious. She said this was her chance for her first publication and portfolio piece, and I ""took it all away"" due to my insecurities. When she asked if anyone at the jury recognized the character was inspired by me, I admitted no one did. She said ""Well, there you have it,"" hung up, and we haven't spoken since.

First of all; sorry in advance for a longer post.

 Me (25M), am thinking about asking my coworker (23F) out. Now I know how most people feel about dating coworkers, but I would also love just in general asking out tips too. Situation is as follows: we work at the same firm, but not in the same division. We do some small talk once or twice a day during lunch breaks etc. We have some things in common which I gathered from our talks, but she doesnt particulary seem interested, BUT also its not like she finds me repulsive. She is just overall nice I feel. So is it worth asking her out if she doesnt have any prior interest in me? Or is asking out the proper way to test the waters and see if she gets intriuged by this? Thing is, we are both working as students, and I am graduating this year and wont be able to work as a student as of next year, meaning if there wont be a non-student job opening at the firm I am essentially fired. So, thats why I have till end of the year at most to ask her out, and I am scared as fuck, but I would feel absolutely horrible if in worst case I leave the firm without knowing how it would have ended up. Also, should I ask her out on a coffee or perhaps something else?

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps.

 I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is ages between 25 and 32 and please have maturity and decency many thanks. 

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy.

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don‚Äôt work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I‚Äôve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!",1,1753549434.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

1m9yf1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1m9yf1b/15_simple_changes_to_reduce_agitation/,15 Simple Changes to Reduce Agitation,"Hey caregivers,

We all know how heartbreaking and exhausting it can be when our loved one with dementia experiences anger, agitation, or sudden outbursts. It's one of the toughest parts of this life.

I also know that everyone here is at a different stage. For those of you who have been in the trenches for years, some of these tips might seem like ""Caregiving 101,"" but hopefully, they can serve as a good reminder. For those who are newer to this role, feeling overwhelmed and just starting to face these behaviors, I hope this list can offer a concrete starting point.

No matter where you are in your journey, sometimes it's the small, proactive changes in daily life that can make the biggest difference. Remember, the anger is usually a symptom of the disease‚Äîa sign of fear, confusion, pain, or frustration‚Äînot a true reflection of their feelings for you. I wanted to share a list of 15 practical tips, broken down by category, that might help create a more calm and predictable world for them, and hopefully, for you too.


Adjustments to Routine: A predictable routine can be a powerful anchor for someone navigating the confusion of dementia.

1. Keep a Consistent Schedule: 

Try to have meals, waking times, and bedtimes at roughly the same time each day. This predictability reduces anxiety about what's coming next. (Many caregivers find a visual schedule posted on the fridge and next to their bed can help with agitation and confusion.)

2. Simplify Tasks: 

Break down activities into small, manageable steps. Instead of saying ""Let's get dressed,"" try ""First, let's put on your shirt,"" and then guide them to the next step. Too many choices or complex instructions can be overwhelming.

3. Incorporate Quiet Time: 

Build moments of calm into the day. This could be listening to soft music, sitting by a window, or looking at a photo album together. It helps prevent overstimulation before it starts.

4. Avoid Rushing: 

Rushing creates stress. Allow plenty of extra time for everything, from getting out the door for an appointment to getting ready for bed. A slower pace is a calmer pace.

5.Validate, Don't Argue: 

If they are upset about something that isn't true (e.g., ""Someone stole my wallet!""), arguing will only escalate the situation. Instead, validate their feeling. Try saying, ""That must be so frustrating. I'm sorry that's happening. Let's look for it together."" You're acknowledging their emotion, not agreeing with the delusion.


Adjustments to Diet: What our loved ones eat and drink can have a surprising impact on their mood and cognitive function.

6. Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate!: 

Dehydration is a very common cause of confusion and irritability. Make sure they are sipping water or other clear fluids throughout the day. (Mio hydration drops can help get them drinking if they don't like water.) Dehydration can also lead to UTIs, a major trigger for sudden behavioral changes.

7. Limit Caffeine and Alcohol: 

These can disrupt sleep, increase anxiety, and act as bladder irritants. Consider switching to decaf coffee/tea and avoiding alcohol altogether.

8. Stabilize Blood Sugar: 

Big swings in blood sugar can cause moodiness. Instead of three large meals, try five or six smaller, balanced meals and snacks throughout the day.

9. Offer Familiar Comfort Foods: 

Sometimes, the taste and smell of a favorite food from their past can be incredibly soothing and comforting. (Even if they are on a specific diet, there are so many alternatives these days, a swap for the problem ingredient is usually possible.)

10. Rule Out UTIs: 

If anger is sudden and out of character, a Urinary Tract Infection is a prime suspect. It often presents with behavioral symptoms instead of physical pain in older adults. Keep an eye out and consult their doctor if you're suspicious.


Adjustments to Environment: A calm, safe, and simple environment can drastically reduce potential triggers for agitation.

11. Reduce Clutter: 

A cluttered space can be visually overwhelming and confusing. A clear, open environment is easier for them to navigate and process.

12. Adjust the Lighting: 

Glare and shadows can be frightening and disorienting. Ensure rooms are well-lit with even, non-glare lighting. Use nightlights to reduce fear and confusion in the dark.

13. Minimize Noise: 

Loud or competing noises (like the TV and radio on at the same time) can be very distressing. Try to maintain a quiet background. If you have guests, try to have them visit one or two at a time rather than in a large, noisy group.

14. Use Familiar Objects:

Surround them with cherished and familiar items, like family photos, a favorite blanket, or a beloved piece of art. These can provide a sense of security and identity.

15.  Check the Temperature: 

Make sure the room isn't too hot or too cold. Physical discomfort is a common, unspoken reason for agitation. They may not be able to communicate that they are uncomfortable.


I know this is a lot, and please don't feel like you have to do it all at once!  Maybe just pick one or two things that seem manageable and see if they help.

Most importantly, please remember to take care of yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup!

Got diagnosed with psychosis symptoms, alot of my issues went away after less stress(kinda not doing much right now at all) so thats good.

But I was thinking, if I did drugs like weed or whatever I probably would've had full blown possibly crisis level psychosis. Not just hidden cameras and telepathy and spirits everywhere.

Obviously theres plenty of people with schizophrenia and related issues who don't do drugs but still... substances can cause issues in the first place.

My issues are also not that severe, yeah I failed classes and struggled to process information in my textbook and was acting really off but it wasn't severe. I had some awareness to talk to a therapist about paranoia issues.

But I keep thinking that theres possibly an alternate reality or version of me out there where I tried to do drugs or try weed or something while on campus and developed a full blown mental crisis from drugs, or got addicted, or whatnot.

Maybe. (Genuinely I've had coffee and tea before and it straight up plunged me to really high levels of paranoia multiple times). Weirdly before I started getting alot of paranoia in general I did notice I got more and more sensitive to coffee.. Freaked out someone was drugging fast food tea cause my paranoia got real high after I drank some sweet tea and I could sense there was a camera somewhere and if i already thought i had telepathy it would just take it up a notch or two(others communicating through the internet router or some weird box on the wall).

Weirdly after quitting coffee I felt alot better mentally like a month later, to a point that I didn't realize I felt bad before but now did.

You live in Korea and you've never been impressed by the local nail polishes here. You think, 'This is a country known for having good gel polish and cute nail art; why do all the regular nail polish options suck??' Streaky, chips easily, doesn't self level... you name it. You mustn't be the only one who thinks this way because a lot of those brands stopped making polish. So you mostly stuck to mainstream brands and boutique brands from America.

But then exchange rates went insane because Korean politics and nail polish prices went up because US politics and shipping/customs was already pricey to begin with. You can't buy polish without bankruptcy yourself. Selling your kidneys wouldn't be enough. You're forced into a low buy.

You keep seeing gorgeous polishes online, but all you can do is watch. Then, you stumble into your local Olive Young one day and bam! A polish catches your eye. Sheer off-white base with a red to yellow microshimmer running throughout. Originally priced at ‚Ç©6000 (about US$4.50) and even cheaper on sale. You contemplate. You've tried the top coat from that brand. You absolutely hated it. But you convince yourself, ""Hey, even if it turns out to be disappointing, it's only as expensive as coffee"" and give in.

You go home and put it on your hands with low expectations. The first stroke. You gasp. It's... beautiful. Stunning. Gorgeous. Immaculate. Breathtaking. It's even shiftier than you imagined. It's perfect. Now, you don't feel as bad about not being able to buy ""the good stuff"" from abroad.

Around 3 years post EAS I started experiencing MCAS symptoms but had no idea what was going on. Every time I ate I would get hives, brain fog, fluid in lungs, Tachycardia, anxiety, high heart rate, and other symptoms for hours. This went on for years with no love from the VA, specialists, DO's, Naturalpaths etc. 

I gave up. I decided that my life was going to be a daily flare, usually around 10am post meal and it would last 2-4 hours. Then my body would crash and recover and I'd be fine of the rest of the day around 2-4. This was the most debilitating event in my life. I lived like this for 5 years before AI helped solve some pieces of the equation. 

If you're a veteran and you are dealing with an issue that sounds remotely like MCAS/MCAD you need to forget the VA. They don't understand this. They will try to treat you for PTS/PTSD and push pills that your body will weaponize in your fight against MCAS.

Super smart guy, went to Harvey Mudd and actually studied economics before moving to CS.

I asked him, what‚Äôs going on your stock? It got crushed in 2022 and never seemed to recovered.

He hesitated and gave me a smile.

We then had a 2-hour long conversation where he told me the comeback story:

1. Data warehousing is becoming the bottleneck for large enterprise AI adoption.

2. Snowflake is one of the multi-cloud warehouses that is SQL-centric with enterprise-level reliability.

3. Snowflake is quietly building out its own AI suite of products that leverages the training from its customers - a dataset that builds a unique moat.

At the end of our what was supposed to be a quick 15-min coffee chat, I was shaken.  My entire view of Snowflake as a dead cat was shattered.

Not sure if this resonates with anyone, but definitely taking a second look as NVDA hits ATHs.

1m9y9id,https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1m9y9id/1924_american_revival_national_convention/,1924 American Revival National Convention | American Interflow Timeline,"‚Äú*Brothers and sisters of the New Republic*,‚Äù a certain William Aberthart began, his voice ringing clear through the packed convention hall. ‚Äú*The old America is dying. Its bones are brittle, its breath shallow, and it no longer remembers what it was meant to be. But we‚Äîthis room, this movement‚Äîare not here to mourn it. We are here to build something better. Not just a nation, but a cause. Not just a dream, but a duty. The Revival is coming. And with it, a new America‚Äîstronger, cleaner, united. Not perfect, but purposeful. Not chained to the past, but rising from its ashes. Let the world watch. Let the doubters jeer. We are not afraid. We are the future‚Äîand the future begins now*.‚Äù

The applause was immediate and thunderous. Delegates rose to their feet, clapping and shouting, some pounding fists on tables, others holding up banners and flags. The energy in the room was raw. It was not the polished kind of joy you would see at a typical party convention, many had noticed it was something more charged, more desperate. Like a crowd that had been holding its breath for years and could finally let it out. But under the cheers, something quieter hummed in the background. The Revivalist movement had entered a season of uncertainty. What had begun as a single, sweeping call for a national rebirth and the idea of the ‚ÄúNational Revival‚Äù had splintered into different ideas of what that actually meant. Aberthart had said ‚Äú*stronger, cleaner, united*‚Äù‚Äîbut not everyone in the hall agreed on how to get there, or what those words were really supposed to mean.

The world outside was changing fast, and the Revivalists were starting to see themselves reflected in strange, distorted mirrors. In Italy, Alfredo Rocco had built a government-in-exile, wrapped in his ‚Äú**Nationalistic Revivalism**‚Äù. His followers preached order and tradition and thought of themselves as the vanguard of a new, revived civilization. Some in the party, especially on its right flank, admired that. They looked at Rocco‚Äôs government in Tripoli and saw something solid. Something that could last. But back on the Italian mainland, something else had taken root. The Italian Social Republic threw away the old hierarchy and embraced revolution instead. Self-espoused Revivalists Benito Mussolini and Michele Bianchi held major influence in a self-declared ""socialist"" nation. Their slogans claimed it spoke of the people, of workers, of struggle‚Äînot glory or God or blood. For many young Revivalists in America, this version hit closer to home. They called themselves Left Revivalists, and they didn‚Äôt want to restore the old America‚Äîthey wanted to burn it down and start over. ""**A Phoenician Revival...**"", as Representative James W. Ford put it.

And then there was Mexico. After the Young Officers‚Äô Coup, General Plutarco El√≠as Calles claimed the Revivalist label for himself. But his version was something different altogether. He nationalized land, poured money into education, and made speeches in dusty villages about justice and dignity. To a growing number of American Revivalists, Calles looked like a prophet. So by the time the first national convention opened in Cincinnati, the **Party for American Revival was already standing on shaky ground**. Not because it was weak‚Äîfar from it‚Äîbut because it had become too big, too loud, and too divided. The hall was filled with passion, but also with friction. While there was common uniformity in the core Revivalist beliefs, such as corporatism, unity through nationality, centralized control, anti-monopolist, total social restructuring, and more‚Äîit was the more underlying issues that caused friction. Delegates argued over everything. Some wanted prayer in schools; others wanted to tear the churches down. One group wanted to restore the ""original"" Constitution; another wanted to rewrite it completely. There were songs and chants and manifestos passed around like candy. **Everyone claimed to speak for ‚Äúthe revivied America.‚Äù. No one could agree on what that was.**

[The American Revival National Convention was held at Cincinnati, Ohio on May 20, 1924](https://preview.redd.it/qnhz6q3d19ff1.png?width=259&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cd0515c06d4cccf4ba03589ac3acfbbe73e00e4)

**William Aberhart** \- A man of conviction was already seated at the speaker‚Äôs podium, flanked by followers who call him ‚Äú**Bible Bill**‚Äù with a mixture of irony and admiration. **William Aberhart, the 45-year old Representative from Dakota**, stands as the most prominent voice of the Center Revivalists ‚Äî a loose but fervent faction that claims neither left nor right, but rather a divine middle. To many of the common folk, he is semi-sarcastically dubbed the ‚Äú**Most Tolerable Revivalist**,‚Äù a phrase passed around coffee shops and church pews alike with a shrug, as if to say, *Well, at least it‚Äôs him and not the others*. But Aberhart does not shy from the label ‚Äî or any, for that matter. A firebrand Christian and former radio preacher turned representative, he proclaims that the foundation of America is, and must remain, spiritual. Those who gather to hear him speak are met not with a bland sermon, but a rhetorical whirlwind ‚Äî one forged in years of religious instruction, honed into political fire. **An adherent to British economist C.H. Douglas‚Äô Social Credit Theory**, he amassed quite the following from the farmers in the northern plain states. While Welfarists and centralists see their ideals reflected in his vision of a moral economy. He praises a ‚Äú**just distribution**‚Äù of wealth and resources, however he would refute any claim that this was echo of socialism, but as a **God-given order**. He avoids hard stances on many cultural debates‚Äîstanding firm merely on the ""**Unity Through Nationality**"" doctrine‚Äî choosing instead to speak of revival in abstract but captivating terms ‚Äî an America returned to itself, not reimagined. Aberhart‚Äôs political appeal is rooted not in charisma alone, but in certainty. ‚Äú*My conviction is that salvation, both personal and national, is at hand if only the people would have fait*h. In *God's good time, the American Century shall come upon us.‚Äù*, Aberhart bombastically declared.

[Representative Aberhart reading the Bible in his office.](https://preview.redd.it/hveah51q19ff1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=030778b04728496e5d6908544d17ecef8df371f7)

**James C. McReynolds** \- The crowds do not cheer when **James C. McReynolds** enters ‚Äî they murmur. Some out of fear, others out of disdain, and a few, still, in reverence. At 62, the former Representative from Kentucky is a relic of a past age and yet a terrifying sign of what may come. His rise had once been meteoric ‚Äî once described as a golden boy of Southern traditionalism and economic conservatism. **The southern re-education programs of President Thomas Custer** had changed him drastically, radically changing his entire conservative worldview, shifting him to learn other philosophies. Later, he was a disciple of **Nicholas M. Butler‚Äôs centralist economics**, McReynolds was molded by a time when America sought to discipline itself back into strength. He once stood proudly for laissez-faire markets and limited government, a Constitutionalist in the old mold. **But the War of the Continental Alliance and Revolutionary Uprising changed him**. What began as suspicion curdled into paranoia ‚Äî and paranoia into policy. McReynolds now speaks with fire and fury about ""threats to America,‚Äù his voice dripping with contempt for what he calls the ‚Äúparasites of modernity.‚Äù **Socialists, immigrants, and ‚Äúinternational financial manipulators‚Äù** ‚Äî all are swept into his broad condemnations. He calls for the **complete centralization** for the sake of order, for a **state apparatus** that roots out sedition in every corner, **corporatism and the nationalization of all US industries**, and for the **consolidation of national identity** through blood and iron. His platform is not coy. It is not softened with talk of spiritual revival or economic fairness. It is manifestation of what he called ""**true Americanist revival**"". A premier propagator of Right Revivalism. Yet despite all this ‚Äî or because of it ‚Äî McReynolds has followers, a large amount. Many who saw a nation still nursing wounds from recent rebellion were comforted by his promise of a strong hand may be more seductive than his enemies care to admit.

[Former Representative McReynolds in his estate.](https://preview.redd.it/x1wlhpet19ff1.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=44f3d33a94d6d1a58da768f7cfbfc1a21e14ef38)

**Arthur E. Reimer** \- A man walks into the room not with thunder, but with the quiet confidence of a man who already sees the next ten years in motion. **42-year old Arthur Reimer**, once a little-known journalist with an eye for upheaval, has quickly become the most articulate voice of the Left Revivalists. His ascension was less about oratory than momentum. When the fires of the Revolutionary Uprising swept through the country, many of the country's left burned with them ‚Äî names like Hiram Wesley Evans and other recent professed ‚Äú**Socialist Revivalists**‚Äù were banned from federal elections until 1926, as were all Revolutionary collaborators. But Reimer stayed clean. He criticized the excesses, avoided direct collaboration, and when the dust settled, he emerged as relevant as ever. His credibility was bolstered not in Congress or a pulpit, but in print ‚Äî **especially after he flew to the Italian Social Republic in one of the first recorded journalistic flights to the new socialist Italy**. There, he studied the **methods of Secretariat of Civil Affairs Benito Mussolini**. Reimer became enamored not with the more traditionally socialist ideals of the new Italy, but with Mussolini‚Äôs idea of a **centralized, distributive national society** ‚Äî where state and labor formed a unified civic body. He returned not as a copycat, but a translator, adapting Mussolini‚Äôs vision into an American context: a ""**new socialist**"", **corporatist state that champions national solidarity** while opposing what he called ‚Äú**the global capitalist machine**.‚Äù He would push that the current ‚ÄúAge of Expression‚Äù be utilized by the state to start an ‚Äú**Age of Proletarianism**‚Äù, where the American-middle class be unified under a single benevolent authority for their interests that will lead the nation into the final revival. Reimer amassed a major coalition of **Left Revivalists** for his campaign, including the gaining the endorsements of Lt. Governor of Mississippi Theodore G. Bilbo, former Revie commander L.E. Katterfield, and the aforementioned Hiram Wesley Evans.

**H.L. Mencken** ‚Äì He arrives late, speaks rarely, and when he does, the room either laughs or goes quiet trying to decide whether they should. Henry **Louis Mencken, age 43, is less a candidate than a question mark** ‚Äî a walking contradiction who seems to enjoy being misunderstood. To some, he‚Äôs a genius. To others, a jester. And the most frustrating part? He doesn't seem to care either way. **A veteran satirist and journalist**, Mencken made his name as a sharp critic of American life, language, and politics, penning essays that skewered everything from moral puritans to populist bombasts. Now, somehow, he‚Äôs here ‚Äî in the middle of the Revivalist surge, running for high office, **quoting Nietzsche one moment and mocking excessive political slogans the next**. He was one of the people who put the term ‚Äú**The Age of Expression**‚Äù in the public lexicon and treat the era with a blend of awe and disdain. His writings are **littered with contradictory** statements, often in the same paragraph ‚Äî one line championing militant discipline, the next praising artistic freedom; one condemning mass democracy, another lauding liberty. He is, as even his closest aides admit, ‚Äú**politically unplaceable**.‚Äù **Isolationist to the bone, yet oddly fond of military aesthetics. Nationalist in rhetoric, yet deeply curious about foreign ideologies. A distributionist who idolizes intellectual elitism.** He praises Revivalism not as a savior but as a mirror ‚Äî ‚Äúthe ideology America deserves,‚Äù he once quipped, ‚Äúfor better or worse.‚Äù Mencken‚Äôs advocacy lies in his ‚Äú**Metamorphosis Theory**‚Äù. According to Mencken, there are three stages to a fully revived society ‚Äî the larvae, the pupae, and the imago. Currently, the United States is still **undergoing the pupae stage**, with the larvae stage ending with the dawn of the 20th century and the Revolutionary Uprising. In order for the US to fully bloom into an imago, it must go under a sort of ‚Äúspiritual circumcision‚Äù ‚Äî a gnash on the flesh to fully awaken the catalyst of a ‚Äútrue revival‚Äù.  ‚Äú*We, the American people, are the worker bees supporting our Great American Hive. However, our hive has not awakened yet to its final form. Only we can facilitate its revival into a new beautiful temple of pure American ingenuity*.‚Äù, Mencken stated.

1m9y6ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/affiliatefinders1/comments/1m9y6ft/recruiting_highquality_affiliates_strategies_to/,Recruiting High-Quality Affiliates: Strategies to Build a Winning Program in 2025,"Recruiting High-Quality Affiliates: Strategies to Build a Winning Program in 2025

Launching an affiliate program is easy‚Äîrecruiting top‚Äëtier affiliates who actually move the needle is the tough part. As someone who has built and managed hundreds of programs over the past two decades, I can tell you that the quality of your partners is everything. The best affiliates are already busy, picky and courted by your competitors, so you need a smart strategy to attract and retain them.

### Understand What Top Affiliates Want

High‚Äëperforming affiliates don‚Äôt just show up and beg to join your program; they evaluate you as much as you evaluate them. Top affiliates want to know how they‚Äôll earn more‚Äîcompetitive commissions, strong EPC (earnings per click), ready‚Äëto‚Äëgo creatives and fast approvals. They also want reassurance that your product converts well with their audience. If your pitch doesn‚Äôt speak to these priorities, you‚Äôll never get their attention.

Practically, this means:

* Offer commission rates that stand out. In some verticals‚Äîfinance, SaaS‚Äîhigh‚Äëperforming partners are used to double‚Äëdigit percentages or hybrid CPA/CPL deals.
* Provide polished creative assets‚Äîbanners, swipe copy and product images‚Äîso affiliates can start promoting immediately.
* Showcase your conversion rate, EPC and average order value to prove that their effort will pay off.
* Be responsive‚Äîtop partners expect questions answered within hours, not days.

And don‚Äôt forget transparency: share average monthly earnings, conversion rates and payment terms upfront. Affiliates are more likely to join when they can see exactly what to expect.

### Target Affiliate‚ÄëRich Environments

You won‚Äôt find the best partners by passively waiting for applications. Instead, go to where they already hang out:

* Niche blogs and authority sites focused on your industry.
* YouTube channels that review or demo similar products.
* Affiliate marketing forums like STM or Warrior Forum.
* Social‚Äëmedia influencers who already promote affiliate links in their bios.
* Competitor review articles‚Äîthis is a goldmine for finding active affiliates.

Affiliate networks help you centralize relationships and tracking, but proactive outreach is where the real wins happen. Identify the places your ideal partners create content and reach out with a personalized pitch.

### Tap into Your Engaged Audience

Some of your best affiliates are already in your ecosystem: repeat customers, superfans and brand advocates. These individuals know your product and can promote it authentically. Invite loyal fans through targeted emails or post‚Äëpurchase flows and offer personalized onboarding. Real‚Äëtime sales notifications and performance dashboards keep these ‚Äúcustomer affiliates‚Äù motivated.

### Build a Dream List

Don‚Äôt just hope for the right affiliates‚Äîbuild a wish list of ideal partners. Start by analyzing your audience to understand what content they consume, then identify creators who share your values and demographic fit. Study your competitors‚Äô affiliates to see who‚Äôs promoting them and how. Tools like **[AffiliateFinders.com](https://www.affiliatefinders.com)** make it easy to identify active partners across multiple channels. Once your list is built, send individualized offers that highlight how promoting your brand can boost their earnings. Relationships matter more than automation; a thoughtful personal message beats a generic ‚ÄúJoin our program‚Äù email every time.

### Use Social Media for Recruitment

Social platforms aren‚Äôt just for promotion; they‚Äôre powerful recruitment tools. Search relevant hashtags, analyze engagement to find creators with active, loyal audiences, run targeted ads to promote your affiliate offer and invite potential partners through Stories, Reels and DMs. Join niche Facebook groups and LinkedIn communities where affiliate marketers gather, and make registration easy by allowing sign‚Äëups using social handles. TikTok, Instagram and LinkedIn can all serve as lead‚Äëgeneration tools for affiliates.

### Create Irresistible Offers

To attract serious partners, give them an offer that‚Äôs too good to ignore. High introductory commissions, exclusive discount codes for their audience, done‚Äëfor‚Äëyou creative assets and real‚Äëtime tracking tools should be standard. Host all of this on a dedicated affiliate landing page‚Äîdon‚Äôt hide the details behind multiple clicks.

### Follow Up Like a Pro

Most partnerships don‚Äôt happen after one message; the follow‚Äëup seals the deal. A consistent cadence‚Äîthree days after the first outreach, seven days later, then one final nudge‚Äîshows affiliates that you‚Äôre organized and serious. Use a CRM to stay on top of your pipeline, customize messages based on the affiliate‚Äôs niche and highlight recent program wins in each follow‚Äëup. Persistence pays off.

### Leverage Affiliate Networks Without Depending on Them

Networks like SquareDance, Everflow, Impact, Awin and CJ provide huge libraries of ready‚Äëmade partners and automate payouts, tracking and reporting. They are powerful tools‚Äîespecially for scaling quickly‚Äîbut don‚Äôt rely on a single network. Different networks excel in different verticals, geographies and commission structures. Test multiple platforms and choose those that fit your niche and growth stage.

### Use AffiliateFinders.com and ExperienceAdvertising.com

Finding the right affiliates can be like finding a needle in a haystack. **AffiliateFinders.com** simplifies this by connecting you with high‚Äëquality partners across multiple channels. You can search by niche, geography or performance metrics and build lists for targeted outreach.

Their team handles recruitment, creative development, performance tracking, optimization and network management on CJ, Impact, Awin and Everflow.

Use **AffiliateFinders.com** to discover partners, networks like CJ, Impact, Awin and Everflow to scale and **ExperienceAdvertising.com** to manage and optimize your program.

## Key Features Analysis

The tea infusing bottle boasts several noteworthy features that contribute to its overall convenience and user experience.

**Durable Construction:** The bottle is typically made from high-quality, BPA-free materials such as borosilicate glass or Tritan plastic. These materials are known for their durability, heat resistance, and resistance to shattering. This ensures that the bottle can withstand daily use and maintain its integrity over time.

The choice of material also contributes to the bottle's aesthetic appeal, with options ranging from sleek and modern glass designs to lightweight and impact-resistant plastic models.

**Integrated Infuser:** The core of the tea infusing bottle is its integrated infuser, which is usually constructed from stainless steel mesh or perforated plastic. This infuser allows users to steep loose leaf tea directly within the bottle. The mesh is fine enough to prevent tea leaves from escaping into the water, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable drinking experience.

The infuser can often be removed for easy cleaning or when the bottle is used for other beverages, such as fruit-infused water.

**Leak-Proof Design:** A critical feature for any portable beverage container is a reliable leak-proof design. Tea infusing bottles typically incorporate silicone seals and secure locking mechanisms to prevent spills and leaks. This allows users to confidently carry the bottle in their bags or backpacks without worrying about messes.

The design often includes a wide-mouth opening for easy filling and cleaning, further enhancing the user experience.

**Temperature Retention:** Many tea infusing bottles offer some degree of temperature retention, either through double-walled insulation or specialized materials. This helps to keep hot tea warm for several hours and cold tea refreshingly chilled.

While not all models prioritize temperature retention, those that do provide a significant advantage for users who prefer to enjoy their tea at a specific temperature.

**Versatile Use:** Beyond tea, these bottles are designed to accommodate a variety of beverages. They can be used for fruit-infused water, herbal infusions, or even as a simple water bottle. This versatility makes them a practical choice for individuals who want a multi-purpose container.

The ability to easily switch between different beverages adds to the overall value and convenience of the tea infusing bottle.

**Easy Cleaning:** Maintaining hygiene is essential, and tea infusing bottles are designed with easy cleaning in mind. The removable infuser and wide-mouth opening allow for thorough washing, either by hand or in a dishwasher (depending on the model).

This simplifies the cleaning process and ensures that the bottle remains hygienic for repeated use.

Key features of the tea infusing bottle include:
* Durable, BPA-free construction
* Integrated stainless steel or plastic infuser
* Leak-proof design with secure seals
* Temperature retention capabilities
* Versatile use for various beverages
* Easy cleaning and maintenance

## Core Benefits

The tea infusing bottle provides a range of practical benefits that enhance the tea-drinking experience.

**On-the-Go Convenience:** The primary benefit is the ability to brew and enjoy tea anywhere. Whether at work, in the gym, or traveling, users can easily prepare fresh tea without needing a separate teapot or infuser. This is especially beneficial for those with busy lifestyles who want to enjoy the health benefits and flavors of loose-leaf tea without the hassle.

The portability of the bottle makes it a perfect companion for daily commutes, outdoor activities, and travel adventures.

**Health and Wellness:** By using a tea infusing bottle, users can easily incorporate the health benefits of tea into their daily routine. Loose-leaf tea is known for its antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, which can contribute to overall well-being. The bottle encourages regular tea consumption, promoting hydration and providing a healthy alternative to sugary drinks.

The ability to customize tea blends and control the strength of the brew allows users to tailor their tea consumption to their specific health needs and preferences.

**Eco-Friendly Alternative:** Tea infusing bottles promote sustainability by reducing reliance on single-use tea bags and plastic bottles. By using loose-leaf tea and a reusable bottle, users can significantly minimize their environmental impact. This is particularly appealing to environmentally conscious consumers who are looking for ways to reduce waste and live more sustainably.

The use of durable and long-lasting materials further enhances the eco-friendliness of the product, reducing the need for frequent replacements.

**Cost Savings:** While the initial investment in a tea infusing bottle may be higher than buying pre-packaged tea bags, it can result in significant cost savings over time. Loose-leaf tea is often more economical than tea bags, and by brewing their own tea, users can avoid the expense of buying bottled beverages.

This makes the tea infusing bottle a financially sound choice for regular tea drinkers.

## FAQs Section

**Is the tea infusing bottle suitable for all types of tea?**
  Yes, the tea infusing bottle is generally suitable for all types of loose-leaf tea, including black tea, green tea, white tea, oolong tea, and herbal infusions. The fine mesh infuser prevents most tea leaves from escaping, although very fine tea particles may occasionally pass through.

  Users can adjust the amount of tea and steeping time to suit their preferences for different tea types.

**How do I clean the tea infusing bottle effectively?**
  Most tea infusing bottles are designed for easy cleaning. The infuser is usually removable, allowing you to rinse it thoroughly under running water. The bottle itself can be washed by hand with soap and water or, in many cases, placed in the dishwasher.

  It's important to clean the bottle regularly to prevent the buildup of tea residue and maintain hygiene.

**Can I use the tea infusing bottle for cold brew tea?**
  Yes, the tea infusing bottle can be used for cold brew tea. Simply add loose-leaf tea to the infuser, fill the bottle with cold water, and let it steep in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight.

  Cold brewing extracts the tea's flavor more slowly, resulting in a smoother and less bitter taste.

**What is the typical lifespan of a tea infusing bottle?**
  The lifespan of a tea infusing bottle depends on the quality of the materials and the frequency of use. High-quality bottles made from durable materials like borosilicate glass or Tritan plastic can last for several years with proper care.

  Regular cleaning and careful handling can help to extend the bottle's lifespan.

A little background: 

Son is 2 and 5 months
Co-sleeping til now
Breast sleeping til now
From Asia so Co-sleeping is a naturally embraced and somehow a  norm.
taking medications and Physical Therapy for my scoliosis whoch unfortunately goes into milk so i really have to do this now

so some of the old wives habit here:

they told me to put an ample amount of lemon on my nipples, coffee or anything bitter to help encourage my child that my breast tastes bad
they (my parents) made me do cold turkey and they took him in during the time of my miscarriage and was at the hospital. which made his separation anxiety worse (he's a velcro baby). after reuniting with him he was so fuzzy, has bad anxiety from separating from me so i went back to breastfeeding him again and went back to zero in the weaning process

fast forward to now, I have to take medications that can go into my milk that my orthopedic doctor told me that i cannot feed from my breast.. and now i tried melting instant coffee and wiping it on my nipples and areola but suddenly he drank the mixture and right now his sleep is so disturbed with the weaning process this made it worse.  tried weaning him from 1 year old til now. 


im struggling, drowning in guilt and in so much pain emotionally (from the weaning and the dysregulation from the stress that he cannot go to sleep until he's worn out. his sleep is so dusturbed and out of his routine already) and physically (from exhaustion and doing everything on my own even with so much pain from my scoliosis and therapy)

Comfort-wise, they‚Äôre a dream. No break-in needed at all. Just lace up and go. They‚Äôve become my go-to for casual days out. Despite being so easy to wear, they still look elevated and sharp. They strike a rare balance between rugged and refined.

Partly because of videos like this one (https://youtu.be/G3kg7QlrbOU?si=ASPHCfWLdQivQa1v) ‚Äî where some idiot got off a train in Podgorica, walked through the worst part of town in the blazing heat, and then trashed the whole city based on that.

But I have to say ‚Äî my experience was completely different. I spent a big part of this summer in Montenegro (a mix of work and fun), living mostly in Podgorica, and for a while in Bar. And I genuinely really liked your capital. Sure, it‚Äôs a furnace during the day in summer, but after 10 p.m. it comes to life in a way we‚Äôre just not used to in the Czech Republic. Around Boke≈°ka and Hercegovaƒçka streets, the bars are buzzing, and I really enjoyed your music too. You play your own (or Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, I don't care) hits ‚Äî unlike back home, where some dumb DJ remixes everything so much you can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs music or roadwork noise. I honestly loved those long Podgorica evenings.

In Tolo≈°i, I lived near a workout park, a few shops, and kiosks ‚Äî honestly, the city felt great to live in. Of course, it‚Äôs never going to be a big tourist destination, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be. And at least your old communist buildings aren‚Äôt crumbling like the ones in Belgrade.

In that video, the guy complains about slow and rude waiters ‚Äî I had the complete opposite experience. Everyone I met was kind, quick, and always smiling. Maybe it helped that I made an effort to speak Serbian, I don‚Äôt know. Even the traffic worked better than what I‚Äôm used to in Brno (my hometown, roughly the same size as Podgorica). Sure, there are jams sometimes, but nothing too bad. And I like both games of Buducnost I visited. Football was shit, but atmosphere great.

The coast is beautiful too. I didn‚Äôt like Budva that much, but Bar and the surrounding area were great. And again, I really liked the beach music at night.

Of course, a few things suck ‚Äî long-distance transport isn‚Äôt great (that damn roundabout near Cetinje!!!), parking by the sea is a nightmare, and the road south of Bijelo Polje is totally wrecked ‚Äî I barely made it through with my little Fabia. Prices are basically the same as in the Czech Republic (except beer ‚Äî draft beer in CZ rarely goes over 2 euros), so I understand it‚Äôs not easy with a Balkan salary (mine are not much higher to be honest). But hey, nothing‚Äôs perfect.

Overall, my experience completely breaks the stereotype that Montenegrins are slow or unfriendly. Everyone treated me well. Don‚Äôt be so harsh on your country! Politics sucks everywhere ‚Äî but as a foreigner, I can honestly say I fell in love with Montenegro. And not just the coast ‚Äî the whole country and Podgorica too.

I've been trying to avoid using the wiki page for ideas about gifts for characters because I enjoy trying to figure out their favourites myself based on personalities, colour and dialogue. My farm is mostly fruit and veg so when there's flowers I always give one to Evelyn or whoever I believe might like that particular type. But with literally everything from my crops, Harvey likes all of it! As much as I love each villager for different reasons, it is a bit annoying when I give them a gift they hate and then they don't return it. Not happened once with Harvey, probably because I quickly realised that he as a careful doctor won't want unhealthy food. He's also one of the only characters to like hazelnut which makes me happy since my farmer's name is Hazel. I was struggling to choose between Harvey and Elliott because I think El's so funny and really sweet... but Harvey's appreciation of all the difficult farming work is unmatched. Can't wait to marry this guy and give him all the healthy stuff (and non-healthy coffee for staying up late making model aeroplanes) he could ever want. <3",5,1753547867.0,StardewValley,0,0.86,False

1m9xsbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/1m9xsbv/want_to_optimize_for_my_lifestyle_spending_habits/,Want to optimize for my lifestyle & spending habits (AmEx vs Chase credit cards?),"I'm a single male Nurse with no kids.

***1. Brief Financial Snapshot***

**Credit Score FICO**: 734 (was higher, but because my school loans just hit, my credit took a dip of about 30 pnts. Not so hard to get it back up).

**Credit History**: 11 years, perfect on time payment history, average total age of credit says 5 years on Credit Karma, no records on my credit at all.

**Income**: $153,000 per year. Single income

**State**: I live in California if that helps at all.  


***2. Current Credit Cards***

Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards

Amazon Prime Visa

Apple Credit Card

Kohl's Credit Card (Through Capitol One)

Yamaha Motorsports Credit Card



***3. Spending Habits (last 6-12 months)***

**Travel**: almost nonexistent at the moment besides traveling to NYC once a year. Besides that, it's mostly car traveling. I drive A LOT. And I like driving to places.

**Dining**: This is probably my biggest category. I like going out to eat and going to coffee shops and treating myself on dates. I also like treating the person I'm dating.

**Groceries**: I mostly shop at Whole Foods, Raley's One, Trader Joe's, and other health foods markets. I sometimes do the meal delivery service like Purple Carrot.

**Gas**: Spend lots on gas. Have a Mazda CX-50 if that helps at all. (Is there rewards for paying my lease on a credit card? Car Insurance?)

**Subscriptions**: Most of my subscriptions are through Verizon. The only other subscriptions I have is Volleyball TV, Spotify, Dollar Shave Club, Manscaped, iCloud, and 24hr Fitness Membership.¬†

I have my school loans that I pay. Is there any benefit of paying through credit for these? I'm assuming no, but, like I said... very new to using my credit and credit lines to my advantage.

**Shopping**: When I shop is mostly at Kohl's, Old Navy, Marshal's, REI, FleetFeet, and Amazon.



**4. Travel Behavior**

As I mentioned before, I do not travel much. But I would like to change that. I've been running for a few years now, and now I'm at a point in my training where I want to start traveling to marathons around the US. But as of now, my traveling is maybe once a year to a different state.

\*Side note, I will be moving to San Francisco, so I want to be able to use other forms of transportation there like Uber, Waymo, Bart, etc... Anyone know of any cards that do benefits like this? That would incentivize me more to use public transportation instead of using my credit card for everything.



**5. Goals**

Maximize rewards and/or cash back

Maximize Perks (the perks on the Amex Platinum look great, but not sure if its to my benefit).

Build credit / get a high limit

Sign-up bonuses for big purchases coming up (Moving to the city in SF soon)

Build a line of credit where I don't have to worry so much about my finances and also be able to save at the same time.



**6. Preferences / Priorities**

I don't mind annual fees, but the only ""annual fee"" I have currently is from the Amazon credit card. So it might take some adjustment on my part. I think I would be ok with an annual fee if I can at least break even from the perks, cash back, rewards, etc from each credit card.

I don't mind getting 2-4 different cards if that's what my lifestyle requires for me to maximize everything. But if it's simple to just get 2 cards, I would be ok with that too. This is not much of a preference, but I don't have much experience using my credit lines to my advantage.

I was looking at pairing Amex cards (like Blue Cash Preferred, Gold, maybe Platinum) or the Chase ones (Sapphire Preferred and the Freedom one) just examples. But these two also seemed like they have good things.¬†



I think I covered everything as far as my background, but if any more info about me is needed, I'm willing to share so I can maximize the response quality I get here.

Hayato now has to adjust to living with five girls living with him. Despite him being the legal owner and boss of the cafe, he has not earned the respect of the girls. Nor can he respect them as he believes that they are the reason that Sachiko overworked herself by not pulling their own weight in keeping the house clean.

  
With funds running low for everyone, Hayato decides to do a soft reopening of the cafe. He decides to show off his coffee making skills to the girls, however, they are not as good as Sachiko's. Even after practicing again and again, his coffee still doesn't get better and Akane's comments only infuriates him more.

  
Then Akane makes the coffee herself and Hayato notices the taste is just like Sachiko's. He requests Akane to teach him how to make it better. After a bit of teasing, Hayato begins to form a bond with Akane.

  
Next, Hayato decides to go out and and do courtesy calls to suppliers about the reopening and takes Riho with him. When Hayato tells them about the reopening, Riho keeps emphasizing how hopeless Hayato is as a manager and proceeds to badmouth him at every turn.

  
It is only when they go to the shrine that Riho tells him that words alone aren't enough when it comes to courtesy calls. He has to show respect to the other businesses and establish a positive connection. He can't think about only himself, he has to think of others. Hayato then decides to do the courtesy calls properly, using Riho's advice.

  
His relationship with Ouka is still poor as they keep fighting over the most trivial things. Riho and Akane suggest for him to compliment her, but every time he tries it backfires on him. It wasn't until he saw the outfits that she made that he made an honest compliment about it (He says so himself that honesty is his strong point). He then learns about her dream of being a fashion designer. She also says that Sachiko told her that Hayato never lies, which is why Ouka knew that he really liked her outfits. She returns the compliment saying that his coffee has improved. Hayato has now started improving his bond with Ouka.

  
Things seem to start looking up for Hayato as he was able to pay the girls some money for their work and the day of the Reopning is almost upon them. Unfortunately, his stocks plummeted and he couldn't sell them in time due to Ami destroying his computer and phone. Before Ami would beat Hayato up, but now Hayato would punish Ami and display his dominance over her.

  
Then the day of the soft opening arrives. The girls lecture Hayato on being a good manager before the customers come in. Hayato follows their advice and starts serving coffee that is just like Sachiko's and more people arrive. Then things get tense when Fuwa, the one that always abused Sachiko arrives. Though, Hayato wants nothing more than to take him down, he keeps his composure, bows to Fuwa and prevents the girls from attacking him out of anger for insulting Sachiko.

  
It is only when Fuwa directly harasses Shiragiku that Hayato gets physical and threatens Fuwa to leave the cafe. Everyone who witnesses this is on Hayato's side. Fuwa then leaves in a huff, knowing that Hayato is not like Sachiko but more like Masahiro.

  
This act has allowed Hayato to finally earn the girls respect and they in turn respect him for being a good boss. Now like a phoenix, the cafe will rise from the ashes with Hayato in charge.",2,1753547443.0,GoddessCafeTerrace,0,0.67,False

I‚Äôve had what I think is a scam with my midterm rental, and I fell for it twice (but the second time I was smarter). I had someone contact me about a townhome that I rent, via text, but they said they saw my unit on FurnishedFinder.  In both situations, they signed a lease agreement but never paid. The first time, they entered the unit, took a few small supplies (wine and coffee pods that I left them) and a key and key fob for the neighborhood amenities.  After about 5 days when they hadn‚Äôt paid and hadn‚Äôt communicated with me or come back to the unit, I changed the key code on the door and told them I was terminating the lease agreement due to nonpayment.  They tried to keep the conversation going but I didn‚Äôt engage.  In this case I had accepted a background check that was recent but I hadn‚Äôt arranged and it looked okay (not great, but okay).  The second time, similarly, they reached out via text, completed a background check, and signed the lease. This time I was requiring key pick up in person after payment but they never showed and didn‚Äôt pay.  They gave various reasons they couldn‚Äôt meet but after 2 days I told them I was terminating the lease and they never replied.  I had a small suspicion that this could be the same person both times because of the way they texted, but they were using different names, numbers and email addresses.  I informed FF and they said it‚Äôs most likely a scam and to cease communication immediately (which I had already done).  

Anyone have any idea what could be behind this? ",1,1753547210.0,midterm_rentals,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs often perceived as frivolous or a waste of time. I'm curious how others who focus on daily aesthetics navigate these situations.

Do you try to explain your viewpoint, or do you just shrug it off? I find that explaining usually leads to more questions and a general misunderstanding of the genuine joy and mental well-being I derive from these small acts. Sometimes I just say it's ""self-care,"" which seems to be a more readily accepted concept, even if it simplifies the motivation.

Have you found any effective ways to communicate the value of aesthetic intention to those who don't share your point of view, or do you find it's best to just keep it to yourself and enjoy it privately?

1m9xkjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m9xkjl/the_customer_return/,The Customer Return,"Hi! I'm a long time listener, first time contributor to Creepcast. I started listening about 6 months ago, with the intention of writing my own horror story eventually. I wanted to hear how horror stories are supposed to sound; how they're supposed to read. Now, I finally have the confidence and the motivation to tell my own horror story. This one, however, is a true story. The events in this story actually took place. For the audience, this story's ending may or may not be true. Please hope it isn't true for you! Turn back now if graphic depictions of kink terrify you. You have been been warned!

I am a wanna-be writer. Unfortunately, wanting to be a writer and being a writer are two very different things. Therefore, I have to pay the bills somehow. My current method of doing brings important context to this story. I work for a rather ubiquitous company who delivers products right to your door at the touch of just a few buttons. We sell all sorts of products from books to baby blankets. Shoes to shower curtains. Batteries to battery operated nipple stimulators. Dog toys to dildos. All sorts of things you can shove yourself into and things you can shove into yourself. One day, it occurred to me that pretty much any item I stick in a tote has a non-zero change of getting stuck up a happy customer's ass. The day of ‚ÄúTHE INCIDENT‚Äù was not the same day.

I was working with problem orders. Basically, a manufacturer will send us cases to truckloads of their products. The vast majority of orders are well marked and easy enough to receive via computers and automated conveyors. Some, however, are messed up in one way or another. Maybe shipping labels are torn so the scanners cannot read the products. Maybe the UPC labels are illegible. Maybe the product itself was damaged in transit and thus is leaking everywhere. This is where I come in. I research the products, get the proper labeling placed on the orders, and let the robots and my co-workers do the rest. We are NOT supposed to receive customer returns; those are SUPPOSED to go to another facility, but of course it still happens from time to time. Murphy's law and all that.

Well, I happened to finish the work I had in front of me, and, like any good worker, I started looking around for more work. I saw a pallet pushed off to the side with some visibly dirty boxes on top. One towards the bottom looked particularly dirty. At least it smelled pleasant enough. Like coffee flavoring..... or ice cream topping. It was a pleasant cinnamony-sugary scent.

I put on a pair of gloves and worked my way down to the dirty box. I noticed on the outside a label marked ‚ÄúCustomer Return.‚Äù I could only assume it was a return due to the amount of substance leaking out of it. So, I donned some gloves, grabbed some bags, logged the box in my computer and cut open the box. My job was to be to salvage the product I could for resale and damage out the rest.

As soon as I opened the box, I could see it was THAT type of box. If you've ever worked in one of these type of facilities, you know the ones I mean. I was immediately greeted with the cartoon images of topless women and pantsless men. I knew I was in for a real treat... NOT! I pulled out the first item; at first I thought it was just your standard cock ring, but this one had a twist. Literally. It had a bump in the middle I learned later was to pinch up a man's urethra. ‚ÄúWhat is the purpose of that!?‚Äù I thought to myself. Well, as scanned it into my computer, my computer helpfully informed me. ‚ÄúMale cock ring for urine retention/BDSM play/male/female/bi/trans/gay/lesbian.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, that's new to me,‚Äù I thought. Little did I know, it was about to get a whole lot worse...

I pulled out the next bag of items. Now I was presented with more of the sticky syrup than before. It was brown, sticky, visous, and it had some sort of grit mixed in. By the way, it was sticky. I just want that to be really clear. This bag's label was so saturated in the stuff that it was sloughing off and I couldn't read it, let alone scan it. I could, however, make out the contents inside of the bag. Collars. Spiked collars to be exact. Like what would be used for dogs, but these clearly were not for dogs, according to the labels attached to the collars. Yes, these collars were meant for role play. Quite disturbing on it's own, but it was only going to get worse from here.... and what is this sticky substance all over everything!? It's gritty and sticky! Did I mention that it's rather sticky? I only say this because I feel like I'm not able to properly mention how sticky this subtance is. It's REALLY sticky! Ew!

I pulled out the next few items, also covered in the sticky substance, which was sticky. So gross!!!! These were your standard kink gear; handcuffs, whips, breast bondage tape. The remarkable part was the sticky substance, which was sticky, was all over these items, too. I could conclude, without a doubt at this point, the box was returned because of the sticky substance all over everything. The sticky substance which was sticky. I just really want to reiterate that point, the sticky substance was sticky. And now I was getting sticky, too!

Seriously, let's delve a little deeper into this idea of a box full of kink gear, covered in gritty, cinnamon-scented sticky stuff. I can't imagine anyone in their right mind would be having a good time right now, but here I was, covered in sticky, gritty, viscous liquid, trying to identify items meant for intimate times. And I STILL had no idea what this sticky substance was! At this point, I could reasonably conclude it was not a baking item. It was definitely not frosting or syrup meant for wholesome family-friendly consumption, and pretty soon I would be proven correct.

I took off my nitrile gloves, careful not to contaminate anything else with the unknown goo (which was sticky, I might add for overemphasis.) As a former lifeguard, I know how to take off contaminated gloves to avoid cross-contamination. Never had I been more glad for that training as was on this day. I put the gloves in a ziplock bag, double-bagged the items I had already removed, put on a new pair of gloves, and resigned myself for what was coming (heh, heh,) next.

The box was now about 2/3 empty, so all that was left was to plunge my hands into the unknown sludge at the bottom of the box, fish out what I could, and maybe solve the mystery of what eactly the sludge was. I reached in, cautiously, and felt the corner of a book. I pulled it out, wiped off the cover and was greeted with the picture of a woman holding ropes, suspended from the ceiling from pulleys. It was a how-to guide on self suspension. My creative mind totally broke at this point.

I could just imagine it; coming home after a hard day of work, entering my house and hearing my wife from upstairs call to me, ‚ÄúHey, big boy! I'm up here! Come find me!‚Äù I ascend the stairs, ‚ÄúHey, Honey,‚Äù I say, as seductively as possible, ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúI'm in the bedroom,‚Äù She replies, ‚ÄúCome find me!‚Äù Now, sans clothes, I open the bedroom door and look at the bed. ‚ÄúHoney, where are you?‚Äù I ask in confusion as I stare at an empty bed. ‚ÄúLook up,‚Äù comes her seductive reply. I look up to see her descend, head first, like a spider from the ceiling... ‚ÄúHey, baby! Ready to get all tied up with me?!‚Äù

I screamed, snapping back to reality. Gone was my wife. Gone was my house. Instead, I was back to standing in front of this gooey, gooey box. My wife never existed in the first place. Nor did my house. All that truly existed was the pain and loneliness of knowing I could be a writer instead. Then I would not have to deal with boxes filled with mystery horrors. I resigned myself to the rest of the box. Now I was determined to figure out what this cloying scent was coming from. At this point, it was sticking to my pores and in my nostrils just like it was sticking to everything else I had discovered inside the box.

Once more, I plunged my hands into the sludge. I pulled out a couple bottles of pills. ‚ÄúDiuretics for Urinary Retention Play,‚Äù they said. Just eew. Seriously, just eew. Oh, and why? But more to the point, just eew.

I plunged my hand in again. This time, I pulled out a loosely shrinkwrapped case of tubes.

The labels were sloughing off, much like the first thing I had pulled out. (Heh, heh! Pulled out!) Fortunately, the labels were that plastic-y sort of thing that can withstand even the most corrosive of chemicals. Finally, the mystery would be solved! What is this sticky, sticky substance which is sticky? What is this nasty, sticky, gooey monstrosity which has destroyed so many vile products with its corrupting influence? I read the label carefully.

‚ÄúCinnamon Flavored Butt Butter Scrub,‚Äù it read. ‚ÄúWait a minute.... FLAVORED?!?!?!‚Äù I thought to myself. I read it again. Yes, it did indeed say, ‚ÄúFlavored.‚Äù

Now, the astute reader may notice a bit of a discrepancy between what I wrote a few paragraphs before and the description of the product. You may point out it says, ‚ÄúFlavored,‚Äù and therefore, is meant for consuption. Well..... yes and no. After some ill-advised research, I found the intended use of the product is to rub on one's butt cheeks, leaving them smooth and silky fresh. Eating this ‚Äúbutter‚Äù is not super advised. It's not discouraged, per se, but it won't harm the submissive party forced to consume it.

Now only one mystery remains: who is the customer returning this box? One would correctly assume it belongs to a rather domineering woman; a dominatrix if you will. But, who? Who is this rough woman? Who is taking command of men and belittling them? Who could it be!? Well, I looked at the label on the front of the box, and I recognized the name.

‚ÄúOh, no!‚Äù I thought, ‚ÄúNo! NO! NO! NO! NOOOOOO!!!!!‚Äù It couldn't be, and yet it was....

Seriously, Dear Reader, if you are afraid of what you have read so far, please turn back now. Once you know the truth, you will NEVER be able to unknow it. No amount of butt scrub will scrub this knowledge from your mind. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

I looked again at the label, and in clear, perfect lettering, it said the name of the woman who returned this package. YOUR MOM.",2,1753547147.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

Would I be terrible if I blocked her?,"So I went with one of my good friends (T, 26M) to a bachelor party few months ago.  Mutual friend from college.  Took a plane down to Miami, and we sat next to a cute girl.  Chatted the whole way down (A, 24F).  We all exchanged numbers with the possibility of hanging out at some point during the party.

Now, let me begin this by saying T is hot, and I say this as a straight man.  He's tall, fit, and gives off a ""bad boy you could bring your friends around"" vibe.  He played baseball where we went to college (I'm a baseball nerd, and we initially bonded over that).  Dude has also been a pretty intense f-ckboi since the day we met.  It ain't my lifestyle, but I'm not about to judge him for his, especially since he doesn't usually lie or manipulate anyone.  Like, he's pretty clear what he's about.

Back to the bachelor party.  These guys are all harder drinkers than me, and it was nuts.  Pretty sure I saw coke at one point.   Multiple men lost all their money (I mean thousands) at a strip club.  One of the days down there, A texts me and asks if we all want to hang.  I talk to the boys and they say she is welcome to come over to the house we're renting.

She comes over, drinks with us, has a good time.  She and I get to talking, clearly flirting.  I ask her if she'd be down for going out sometime when we get back from the party.  She says she'd really like that.  Literally ten minutes later, T swoops in, grabs her by the hand without saying a word, takes her into another room, and has sex with her.  It was actually kinda impressive.  They're gone for about an hour, then he just steps out of the room and says something like, ""Let's go, boys!"" We all head out to another bar, straight up leaving her there.

Let me clear, I'm not mad at either of them.  One, T tells me later he had no idea I had asked her out. Two, she's a grown woman and an agreement to get coffee sometime does not make us exclusive.  Nobody did anything wrong as far as I'm concerned.

Anyway, we eventually head home.  I've never been so hungover.  I feel like literal sh-t.  I'm surprised T is alive; at one point in the night I looked over and saw him 180ing vodka.  On the flight home, A is texting T pretty often.  I'm not reading what she's saying because that's rude, but I do recognize the number.  I ask T is he's gonna see her again, and he tells me he has no interest/is planning on ghosting her.  Again, not my move, but he can do what he likes.  As I'm driving him back to his apartment from the airport, I tell him and had just asked her out on a date before he hooked up with her.  He is genuinely sorry; said he knew we were flirting, but didn't think there was anything more than that.  I'm not mad at him; it was a bit of a c-ckblock, but honestly nothing to get super angry about.  In my mind, based on her choices, I don't feel like much was lost in that regard.

So a few days later, A texts me.  Just small talk stuff at first (how you doing, did everyone make it back alive, etc).  Turns into a debriefing on the party.  Finally she asks me when we're going to go get that coffee.  I'm all, ""You mean platonically, right?"" She says she thought I had meant like a ""date"" date.  I said I had, but she banged my friend like ten minutes after that.  Now I CLEARLY said right then and there that I don't think she did anything wrong.  And I would love to hang as friends (she seems like a nice person).  But I'm just not interested in anything else anymore.  She straight up says she's disappointed, and I say I'm sorry to hear that.  Thought that would be the end of that.

A few days later, she says she'd like to get coffee as friends.  I say awesome.  We meet up after work and hang out; good times.  We do this a few more times, each time I think it's all good.  On hangout number 5 or 6, she asks when we're gonna officially go on a real date, or do we just count all of these hangouts as dates retroactively?  I'm like, ""Ummm.... No?"" Again, I made it very clear I'm not interested in anything outside of friendship. She says that we clearly enjoy spending time together, she thinks I'm attractive, yada yada.  She says she made a mistake hooking up with T and tries to blame the booze (she wasn't drunk when she tried to text him the next day, but whatever).  I just stress I think we work better as friends, and we awkwardly leave a bit later.

Since then, girl has texted me with more personalities than Kevin Wendall Crumb.  She'll say she's sorry, and she wants to stay friends.  I'll say cool, and we'll have a nice chat.  A few hours later, she'll randomly text to say I'm trying to punish her for hooking up with my friend and that I'm letting my ego get in our way.  I'll just tell her I'm sorry I hurt her feelings or something like that.  Then she'll text me an apology the next day; she'll say she really likes me and asks if there is no way we can give it a real shot. When I very politely say I don't think so, she'll get mad and call me an assh-le for leading her on.  Then she'll apologize the next day and want to go get ice cream and show me pictures of her girl friends to ""set me up.""  Rinse and repeat.

Look, my friends are all like ""block her."" But I feel bad; I obviously hurt her feelings, and I would feel bad just bailing without saying something.  My friends think there is no closure here.  Just run.  T says I shouldn't have agreed to hang out in the first place; while he knows I meant well, he says I unintentionally lead her on.  I think I was pretty clear from the get go.

So am I the assh-le for ""leading her on""?  And would I be an assh-le for blocking her?",3,1753546987.0,AITAH,15,1.0,False
1m9xi2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m9xi2b/i31m_am_getting_weird_vibes_regarding_my_long/,I(31m) am getting weird vibes regarding my long time friend/roommate(30m) and my fianc√©(30f). What‚Äôs the best way to handle this situation?,"Due to rises costs, my fianc√©, child, and I decided to get a place with a longtime friend. It‚Äôs been very beneficial financially and it‚Äôs honestly been the only thing to keep us from going under. My roommate and I have been friends for nearly 15 years and despite some conflicts when we were young, I generally trust and respect him.

Our child is special needs and it involves one of us needed to be available at all times for her, meaning that one of us is always unemployed. Our child is nonverbal and is on a shortened school schedule. We don‚Äôt really have any social support so care responsibilities fall exclusively on us. Currently, I am stay home with our child while my fianc√© works.

Our roommate works at the same place as my fianc√©. She started there shortly after our move and suggested he apply as well, having just resigned from a stressful middle management position. He applied and started a month later. Shortly after, things started getting a little weird.

I want to start off by saying that I‚Äôm not a jealous person. I have been cheated on before and healing took a lot of time and therapy. It‚Äôs taken a great deal of work and self awareness to not be some wounded individual assuming every person who gets close to me will eventually betray me.

My roommate and fianc√© spend a lot of time together. They generally car pool together, 20 minutes there and 20 minutes back home. They‚Äôre usually in the same department or at least have a lot of overlap in tasks. More often than not, they take their lunches together. I fully understand that they will spend a lot of time together due to work and that would never bother me nor is it the source of the weird vibes.

While they are at work, I‚Äôm with my nonverbal child and am in dad mode the minute I crack my eyes open to the moment they go to bed. Pick up, drop off, cleaning, baths, activities, ect. Of course, my fianc√© is more than happy to be with and do stuff for our child when she‚Äôs home; she loves our child and loves being a mom. Due to her being at work 40 hours a week, the majority of the responsibility falls on me, which I also love. It can be exhausting but I love getting to be with our child.

Generally, I am also handling our monthly budgeting, paying and keeping track of all the bills, cooking dinner most nights, and handle a lot of the day to day chores and cleaning. They do help out with chores when they‚Äôre available but I will generally handle what I can.

Initially, this whole dynamic was fine. However, things started getting a little strange after the first month of them working together. When they came home, they were always talking about work. I get it, they work together, no biggie. I found it really hard to participate in conversations as I do not work with them.

I would generally sit in silence while they talked and laughed back and forth nightly for hours. Whenever I would chime in or try to join the conversation, I would generally be interrupted or corrected by my roommate and then he would turn his attention back to talking and laughing with my fianc√©. This sort of thing happened multiple times and I feeling like a third wheel in my own relationship. I only really get to see my fianc√© at night and it felt like what little time we had together was being monopolized by my roommate.

I eventually opted out of joining their conversations at all as there generally was not room for me in them. I took it in stride and decided I would just go do my own thing during these times.

I began to notice my roommate‚Äôs behavior changing a little. Whenever my fianc√© spoke, he would stop what he was doing and would give her his undivided attention. He would laugh at her jokes and always made time for her. He always jokes about how they‚Äôre the same person and that they have so much in common. They have their own work language and inside jokes. They‚Äôve made quite the connection over the last few months.

When I try to talk to him, I feel like I‚Äôm mostly annoying him. He doesn‚Äôt really laugh at my jokes or engage in convo with me unless we‚Äôre talking about video games. It‚Äôs very rare that he‚Äôll actually seem interested in talking with me. Again, that wouldn‚Äôt bother me, but I do notice a huge difference in how he handles my fianc√© and I.

He was insistent on us putting all of our TVs in the same shared space so we can hang out and play games together every night. It was expected that we would all hang out every night. Any mention of wanting to move TVs or spend time in personal rooms was met with our roommate politely arguing that it was more fun to hang out together or looking kind of sad that we weren‚Äôt hanging out.If my fianc√© wasn‚Äôt in the room, he was generally very quiet or would go to bed early.

My fianc√© and I had very little personal time as a result of all this. Very little time together when we‚Äôre not with our child and almost no intimacy. Finally, her and I started to simultaneously feel this weird strain and talked about it privately. I explained everything that I was feeling. I didn‚Äôt accuse her of anything, I just explained that I often felt like a third wheel and that it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve gotten to see her in months. I explained that I‚Äôm alone all day with our child and then you guys spend most nights laughing about work and anytime I attempt to join in the conversation, I‚Äôm shut down or corrected. I explained that I don‚Äôt really feel like I‚Äôm in a relationship anymore and that I‚Äôm a third wheel designated to take care of our child and the house.

Again, I wasn‚Äôt accusatory nor did I believe she was cheating, but I felt weird. She immediately understood what I was saying. She agreed that it was super weird that I was often not involved in or completely pushed out of conversations despite our roommate being literally one of my best friends. She apologized for any part she might have had in contributing to the weirdness and assures me that absolutely nothing was going on.

We had a very healthy conversation and we realized, to our shock and horror, that it had been nearly 6 months since we had any actual alone time. Sure, we were intimate here and there but as far as doing a thing together, it had been ages. We were even doing are usual weekly coffee dates anymore. We committed to correcting all of that immediately.

She also admitted that I wasn‚Äôt alone in feeling weird regarding our roommate. She was picking up on small, but growing ‚Äúoff‚Äù feeling as well and my expressed feelings had affirmed that for her.

During their rides to and from work, our roommate has been attempting to have deep and emotional conversations. At first, this didn‚Äôt strike her as odd. She‚Äôs open to having deep conversations with anyone who‚Äôs cool enough to have them. They started to be less philosophical and more or less trauma dumping. He would spend the ride venting his feelings and emotional state, talking extensively about his mental health issues and what he was dealing with that day.

The nature of the conversation started to make my fianc√© a little uncomfortable. She didn‚Äôt want to be rude and shut him down completely but she would suggest talking me to about it, since I‚Äôm supposed to be his best friend. He would explain that he doesn‚Äôt want to talk about the kind of stuff with me because he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to put more on my plate‚Äù. The she reminded him that he and I have been friends for literal years, he expressed that he doesn‚Äôt feel like he can have darker conversations like that with me. He says we can talk about video games which is cool but he can‚Äôt tell me stuff like this.

I drove 4 hours to be at his dad‚Äôs funeral with him. I was his best man at his wedding and hosted his bachelor party. I was there during his divorce and during his struggles with alcohol. I made myself available to him anytime he needed me. I played games that I hated just to spend time with him so he wouldn‚Äôt feel alone. I checked in on him constantly during some of the darker periods of his life. I would drop anything and everything if he needed my help. And we‚Äôve had so many deep and dark conversations over the years. We‚Äôve experience so much of life together. Why does he suddenly feel like my life partner of almost ten years is the ONLY person he can talk to??

Needless to say, their weird feeling amplified. I began to wonder if he wasn‚Äôt developing feelings for my finance. After our conversion, we decided it was best to establish clear boundaries with our roommate. We committed to spending more time together and to reforging our privacy, despite how potentially sad that might make him.

We explained to him that we needed space to be a couple and that there needed to be sone degree of separation. He got somewhat defensive and explained that if we wanted space, we just needed to ask. When she asked why the couple having personal space wasn‚Äôt the default in his mind and why we needed his permission to take it, things devolved from there.

While things have calmed down, there‚Äôs still a weird tension. Anytime we try to do something without him, he is viably bothered despite his best efforts to hide it. My fianc√© is no longer engaging in the trauma dumping convos which is also bothering him. He now feels like she‚Äôs suddenly treating him differently.

And now I can‚Äôt shake this feeling that he secretly wants to be with my fianc√©. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm crazy or what I should even do at this point. I feel like we‚Äôre too locked into this living situation to fully address all of this.

Her and I are debating possibly finding our own place once the lease is over but it‚Äôs very possible we‚Äôre both overreacting. How would you guys handle this situation?",2,1753546979.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

1m9xgr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1m9xgr4/future_nesting_partner_moving_in_with_someone/,Future nesting partner moving in with someone else - please help!,"So I‚Äôm (29 nb) in a long distance relationship with my life partner (30 f) while I‚Äôm studying at a college ~3:30 hours away, I was driving back  1-3 times a month average sometimes more. We were living together for a year before I moved away and it‚Äôs been in total almost 4 years. We intend to move in together in a new city in about 10 months (which is pretty close compared to how long I‚Äôve had to be here). We have always considered ourselves nesting partners. We are in love and have overcome lots of very tough experiences.

I have a long 10+yr poly history but due to my studies and other health stuff haven‚Äôt dated anyone during this time. She was not poly before meeting me and has since had a few periods of dating other people, including brief throuple situation that was actually very damaging to me. This involved one of her partners moving into our home against my consent after leaving their home due to interpersonal conflict. Following that strange 3 person dynamic starting which involved some pretty problematic things that left me a bit traumatised (not using that flippantly). We have since talked this through and healed somewhat.

Anyway, that was a while ago now. My partner has been living in a house that we both used to live in where some abusive family of mine are the landlords, and she was evicted a month ago. I spent 3 weeks in the heat helping her pack up and move stuff into storage. Alongside this, for about 2 months she has been dating someone else, and post eviction stayed with this new partner to have somewhere to live. There is no spare room in the house and no way for me to visit. I‚Äôve been there for a few hours, it‚Äôs a beautiful house and with her partner (who I have met and we get along fine) and a mutual friend of theirs. For various health/disability/queer reasons my partner really struggles financially and has a lot of housing trauma. Being in that house she can sleep properly and have people care for her, which I obviously want her to have. But due to this she may need to stay at the house (ie move in with the other partner) for the 10 months before we get together. 

This feels terrible to me as we won‚Äôt be able to see each other (unless she makes a pretty terrible train journey (5hours and many transfers) that her health can‚Äôt really handle. Also we don‚Äôt use ‚Äúprimary/secondary partner‚Äù labels so it felt before like nesting partner was a nice way to describe our special thing. Is that undermined if she moves in with someone else? It was hard for me even when she started dating someone else, because it made me understand how much we were losing to long distance. I haven‚Äôt really struggled with ‚Äòjealousy‚Äô before, and I think this really is more about the sense of loss inevitable in a LDR. I feel sort of abandoned: we were both a team taking on the rubbish experience of waiting to live with someone you love, but now with only 10 months to go she‚Äôs moving in with someone else; it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm the only one left, alone against the distance. Missing before-sleep late night phone calls, knowing she‚Äôs making coffee for someone else every morning, when that is the thing I dream about every second of every day. I feel heartbroken.

Another thing: there‚Äôs a pattern here. On both occasions, and there are other examples, something I don‚Äôt want to happen (and made that very clear) then has to happen due to big scary things like the broken housing market or a lack of support for disabled people. It‚Äôs hard for me to understand how to feel because obviously material safety should take priority over my feelings but when it keeps happening it‚Äôs hard to watch my boundaries get trampled again and again. Her communication can also be off and she sometimes isn‚Äôt the most supportive, especially over the phone, which makes not being able to visit her even more scary. It‚Äôs also all playing havoc with my already pretty sketchy mental health. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Much love xx",1,1753546891.0,polyamory,1,0.99,False
1m9xghy,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1m9xghy/completed_2nd_fast_4_day_and_5_day/,"Completed 2nd Fast, 4 Day and 5 Day"," I completed my second fast last night, 120 hours. I had done a 4 day, 2 day refeed and then this 5 day. I'll now refeed for 2 days and go into another 5 day fast. I guess these are called rolling fasts? I'm planning on doing 2-4 more 5 day fasts. Everything went great. As expected a few moments of weakness, not much hunger, a few moments of stomach cramps.  Overall, as with my first fast, much easier than  expected. 

I'm not a purist because my goal is lose weight by any means possible.  I drank one cup coffee each morning, 0 cal. Gatorade or Powerade (1.5 bottles per day) and at lunch 0 cal. Sunkist. Having some flavor with the 0 cal drinks help me get through the day by giving me something to look forward to, so not giving those up. :-)  I also take a multivitamin each day. 

Oh yes, and the insomnia the last few days, UGH. Same as the last fast. This time I was more liberal with the Melatonin, I was afraid it would make me too groggy or add to my weakness the last time but it didn't. It only gave me a few hours sleep, not the whole night. Still better than nothing.

My biggest issue I'm now struggling with is...I broke down and weighed. I wasn't going to because I knew I had blown up, which was the reason for the fast in the first place. 

7 years ago I quit smoking. Before then I maintained around 135 (still a struggle even then and wanted to lose a few pounds lol) I then blew up to the 170s. I'm 5 ft tall so this weight has been a real issue. It simply doesn't take much at this height to gain weight. Nobody around me can understand that I gain weight if I eat over 13-1400 calories.  As I said in another post, I'm constantly being sabotaged by well meaning people.  Advice I'm given, 'I'm not eating enough and I'm putting myself into starvation mode', 'quit weighing I'm too obsessed over it', 'quit counting calories', 'build muscle'....and on and on. 

I've already went low carb and do IF. and have been for a couple of years. That helped me get down from the 170s to the 150s. I worked hard and got down to 141 but gained it back over the past few months. It's been a terribly stressful year with a car wreck, 2 deaths, and a life threatening illness of a sibling. So I've been stress eating and I knew, of course, I had put on weight.

This weight gain came from simply too many calories because I still do IF, and still low carb by most standards....for my body I've been eating too many carbs though.  My diet is still healthy with very few processed foods, hardly any sugar...etc. 

But after two weeks of fasting I weigh 157. I had expected a much lower number.  It makes me sick. I had thought I had blown up to around 158 but apparently I was much bigger than I realized. I must have been at least 162 or 163.  It's scary how fast this weight can come back on.  I was just walking around, seeing people, thinking I'd gained 'a little' weight but here I was blown up like a beached whale. How do I get to that level of denial or disassociation or reverse body dysmorphia or whatever that is??? I only fully realize how big I am when I start trying to lose. 

I didn't mean to turn this into a book but I was just very discouraged when I saw my weight. 

I thought I was going to be able to knock this out with a few fasts but I now see it's going to take a lot longer than I first expected. 

The thing that has changed, is that when I do finally reach my goal weight, which right now is 135, I finally have the solution for maintaining it. 

I haven't done much fasting because of being told it wasn't healthy...yada yada yada. But realizing now, I  can do it, and it's not really as hard as one would imagine, I plan on incorporating it into my weight mgt.  Because here's the problem for me....my calories are so low it's hard have decent meals, meals other people take for granted, without going over my calorie limit. I can't live never having a decent meal. So I'm going to fast a couple of days a week which will give me extra calories to use to splurge on a meal or two over the weekends. I'm actually excited about this part because it had never occurred to me.  

So I just have to put my big girl pants on, my very big girl pants, and get through this extreme dieting faze no matter how bad I dread the weeks, months, it's going to take because at least now I have a solution. Oh how I wish I had figured this out years ago.

Before lockdown, I could hold a conversation, give a presentation, even small talk was no big deal. Now? I trip over the simplest stuff, like ordering coffee or saying hi at work.

Feels like we spent so much time glued to screens that actually talking to people face-to-face just feels weird. I catch myself overthinking every single word. And public speaking? Forget about it. Total anxiety meltdown.

So I started looking for ways to get some of that confidence back, and I found this app called [Amplivio.io](http://Amplivio.io), Honestly, it‚Äôs been a huge help.

1m9xfe7,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayUpgrades/comments/1m9xfe7/why_choose_the_breville_bov650xl_toaster_oven_for/,Why Choose the Breville BOV650XL Toaster Oven for Your Kitchen?,"Trying out the Breville BOV650XL feels like adding a small but mighty helper to my kitchen. I was drawn to this compact smart oven because of its sleek brushed stainless steel finish and promised functionality. With limited counter space in my kitchen, I appreciated how its smaller footprint still managed to deliver on features typically found in larger models. At first glance, it fit perfectly next to my coffee maker, looking more like a high-tech gadget than a standard toaster oven.

**Ease of Use and Intuitive Controls**  
One of the standout features of this product has to be its easy-to-navigate digital controls combined with a knob control system. After I unboxed it, the controls were straightforward enough that I barely needed to glance at the manual. With eight preset functions like ‚ÄúToast,‚Äù ‚ÄúBake,‚Äù and even a sneaky little ‚ÄúPizza‚Äù setting, cooking different types of meals became as simple as turning a knob. I'll admit I spent an embarrassing amount of time toasting bagels just to perfect the shade with the adjustable settings. Its backlit LCD display changes between orange when cooking and blue when idle, a small but satisfying touch that makes it feel modern and premium.

**Cooking Performance and Results**  
This compact oven is powered by Element IQ, which adjusts the power and cooking time depending on what you‚Äôre making. This feature didn‚Äôt seem like a big deal to me at first, but after baking some brownies and trying out roasted veggies, I could tell it was more than just a gimmick. The heat distribution is even, and it didn‚Äôt leave me with hotspots or undercooked portions, particularly with frozen foods. Reheating pizza felt like a revelation since it came out crispy every time, unlike the soggy mess a microwave leaves behind.  

[Check Breville BOV650XL price on Amazon.](https://grillsbbq.com/p/b00357ys3a/)

**Capacity and Design**  
Despite its compact size, this little guy surprisingly holds its own when it comes to capacity. I managed to fit a 12-inch pizza inside without fuss, and four slices of bread toast evenly‚Äîit‚Äôs enough for a small family or those of us who enjoy late-night toast binges. The compact design is friendly on counter space, without making you feel like you‚Äôre sacrificing too much in terms of quantity. However, the brushed stainless steel exterior does get smudged quite easily, which was mildly annoying for me.

**Energy Efficiency and Smart Features**  
A less obvious perk is the energy efficiency. The oven heats up quickly thanks to that 1800-watt power, reducing the need for extended cooking times. I loved how it replaced the need to use my large oven for smaller dishes. Plus, the pre-set memory feature saved me time once I figured out the settings I used most often. Each moment shaved off cooking and reheating times felt like a small victory as I juggled tasks in the kitchen.

**Advantages**  
- Compact design with ample capacity for daily needs  
- Element IQ technology ensures even cooking  
- Multiple presets, great for cooking a variety of meals  
- Energy-efficient operation reduces cooking time  

**Shortcomings**  
- Stainless steel finish tends to show smudges and fingerprints  
- Lacks a convection feature that some competitors include  
- Doesn‚Äôt come with a built-in light for monitoring food  

**Competing Products**  
While the Breville BOV650XL is fantastic for its compact size, competitors like the Black+Decker TO3240XSBD provide models with convection heating at a similar price range. I‚Äôd argue the Breville outshines its rivals with its premium feel and ease of use. The lack of a convection feature can be a hiccup, though, especially if quick baking is important. Meanwhile, the Cuisinart TOB-135 has a built-in light, which makes monitoring food easier‚Äîbut its control panel felt less intuitive than Breville‚Äôs smooth design.

**Price Performance**  
This oven strikes a balance between quality and price, falling into an affordable premium niche. Considering how well it performs and how user-friendly it is, I'd say it's worth the investment. Sure, there are cheaper toaster ovens out there, but investing in something that feels this sturdy and versatile right out of the box felt like smart spending on my end. Its long shelf life adds to its financial value‚Äîa major plus for anyone mindful of cost efficiency.
