LONG STORY AHEAD

2032. December 20.

The date glows faintly on the car panel.

The speedometer reads ""80"" as the highway stretches endlessly ahead. He drives steadily, eyes focused, hands relaxed on the wheel. City lights thin out behind them. The air grows quieter with every passing kilometer.

She leans against him in the passenger seat, half asleep, her head resting lightly on his shoulder. She is his long term girlfriend, soon to be his wife. This trip is meant to be simple. A short vacation. A return to his childhood home. A pause before marriage and starting their life together.

His parents no longer live there. The house has been empty for years, kept only out of attachment. That is why he chose it. Just the two of them, away from everything.

The road sign flashes past.

Highway ends.

He eases his foot off the accelerator.

The speed drops from ""80"" to ""60"".

Further ahead, as the road narrows and trees begin to crowd the sides, it shifts again from ""60"" to ""40"".

The engine hum softens. Gravel replaces asphalt. The countryside presses closer now, heavier with memory.

He talks about the place as they drive. The old park. The narrow roads. The quiet nights. She listens with a tired smile, imagining it through his words.

They stop by a small café near the turn toward the house. It is run by an old man her boyfriend has known since childhood. The café has been there for as long as he can remember. A barrel stands near the counter with a small framed photograph of the man’s wife placed on top. She passed away years ago. The man serves coffee quietly, his face carrying a permanent sadness.

Her boyfriend tips him generously. For a brief moment, the man smiles.

They arrive late.

The house stands exactly as he described. Old walls. Familiar doors. A sense of time slowing down. They eat dinner quietly, sharing stories and small laughter. Travel fatigue settles in. They go to bed. He pulls her close and holds her tightly by the waist. He kisses her gently. Sleep takes them without effort.

It is 6:15 a.m. when she wakes up and looks at the clock.

A sound carries through the morning air. A dull thud. Repeated. A ball hitting pavement. The sound echoes clearly.

She shifts slightly, still wrapped in his arms. He holds her firmly by the waist. She drifts back toward sleep. The sound repeats again.

A child is playing outside.

She listens for a moment, confused. The house is silent otherwise. She tells herself it must be early morning noise. Still half asleep, she carefully slips out of his hold and sits up.

She gets out of bed.

The hallway feels colder than before. Her footsteps are soft. The front door stands ahead of her. She hesitates, then opens it.

She steps outside.

The air feels different immediately. Cooler. Heavier. The streetlight outside hums faintly, its yellow glow uneven and dull. The houses opposite have faded paint and older designs. Electrical wires sag lower than she remembers, tangled across the poles.

The road surface is rougher. A torn poster clings to a wall nearby. The colors are sun burned. It shows cricketers lifting a trophy, confetti frozen mid air. The words “India World Champions 2011” are printed boldly across it. She pauses, staring longer than she should.

That already happened, she thinks. Long ago.

A few steps ahead, another hoarding stands crooked near a tea stall. A smiling face holds up a phone much smaller than the one she owns. “iPhone 4. This changes everything.” The edges of the poster are peeling. Dust has settled into the creases.

A woman calls out to her from behind.

She turns.

Her breath catches.

For a moment, she cannot move. The sight of the woman unsettles her in a way she cannot explain. The face, the posture, the familiar warmth in the voice feel wrong in this place and at this time. Her mind struggles to place the memory. She is certain she has seen this woman before.

Her throat tightens as recognition creeps in.

It is the same café at the turn of the road where they had coffee the previous day. The same woman. Alive. Standing there. Looking at her with concern. The woman asks if she is looking for something. Her husband stands beside her, watching quietly.

The sky suggests early morning, yet the light feels wrong.

Her heart races. She forces herself to think calmly.

They drove for hours. She must have been too tired to notice things clearly last night. She is still half asleep.

She walks forward.

The road leads to a small park. The metal of the swings is chipped. The paint on the benches is cracked. Under a flickering streetlight, a single boy stands there, kicking a football against a wall. The sound matches what woke her. Each kick echoes through the empty space

She stops near him.

The boy looks up at her. He cannot be older than ten. A faint scar runs across his forehead, partly hidden by his hair. Something about the curve of his eyes, the shape of his smile, the way he tilts his head it feels uncannily familiar. Not directly, but it tugs at a memory she cannot place, a shadow of the man she knows.

She feels a strange pull, a flutter in her chest. A sense of recognition, inexplicable and deep, grips her.

She asks softly, “What’s your name?”

He answers casually, smiling.

The sound of his voice makes her breath catch. It’s the same voice she knows, the same warmth and rhythm she hears every day. The same tone that feels like home. A sharp wave of nostalgia hits her, as if she has stepped into a memory she didn’t know she had.

The ground feels unsteady beneath her feet.

She steadies herself and sits on a nearby bench. The boy continues playing, chatting freely, as if nothing is unusual. He talks about school, his friends, and his dreams. She listens, holding back tears she doesn’t fully understand.

Eventually, she joins in, kicking the football a little too hard. The boy trips over it, and her heart lurches. She cries out herself in sudden pain, guilt and worry flooding her.

She rushes to him without a second thought. She tears a piece of cloth from her sleeve, carefully wraps it around his scraped knee, and draws him into a hug. He leans into her, tiny hands clutching her jacket. She hums softly, pressing her cheek to his hair, feeling his small warmth and trust. Slowly, his sobs ease into quiet sniffles.

They sit together on the grass.

The boy looks up at her. She meets his gaze. Those eyes… she could drown in them. She has seen them before every day but never like this. Her hand rises instinctively, brushing back the hair on his forehead. Her fingers trace the faint scar he got at five. She knows it. She recognizes it. Her tears spill onto his small hand before she can stop them.

The boy tilts his head, concerned. “What’s wrong? Why are you crying?”

She shakes her head, voice soft. “Nothing… I was just remembering someone I really love.”

He smiles innocently. “Then he must be lucky.”

He doesn’t realize that the person she loves is the boy sitting in front of her.

He pulls out a piece of paper from his pocket and begins drawing. She watches quietly as a figure slowly takes shape.

A woman.

From the perspective of a seven-year-old boy, her eyes are wide and curious, full of gentle wonder. Her hair falls softly across her shoulders. Her lips curve with a quiet kindness. The image radiates warmth, like someone who could make a stranger feel safe. Even in rough strokes, she feels like home.

She asks, voice barely above a whisper, “Who is she?”

He lowers his gaze. “I don’t know… But she feels like home. I saw her in my dream last night.”

Then he looks up at her and smiles. “You… you look just like her. So pretty.”

She laughs softly, a mixture of shyness and amusement. “Maybe… I’m someone you’ll meet soon.”

Suddenly, a loud honk breaks the quiet.

“Peep! Peep!”

His school bus pulls up. The conductor calls for him.

He grabs his football and the drawing, starts running toward the bus… then pauses. He looks back at her, runs toward her again, and hands her the drawing and the football. She bends down to pick up the ball, and he plants a quick kiss on her cheek. Then he dashes toward the bus, waving once over his shoulder. And in a moment he vanishes like a butterflies in the autumn

She stands frozen for a moment, heart pounding, feeling a rush of warmth and longing she cannot explain.

She decides to go home.

She reaches the front door and opens it.

A flash of light blinds her.

She stumbles inside.

Those same eyes.

That same voice.

“Where have you been so long? I was waiting for you.”

No it isn’t the kid.

It’s her boyfriend. The same boy, older now.

She looks at him. The voice matches perfectly. The same voice that spoke to her in the park.

She clutches the drawing.

Her breath trembles.

He looks at the ball and the sketch, eyes widening. The same football, the same drawing… He can hardly believe it.

Memories flood back. “So what I thought was just a memory all these years… growing up… it was real?”

He steps closer and kisses her. She cries into his arms. He strokes her hair gently, whispering comfort, then hands her the ball.

“Do you know how to play football?” he asks softly.

She nods through tears.

“Good,” he says, smiling. “This time… you can hit me as hard as you want. I won’t cry this time i promise”

The story ends.

1prd013,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexadvise/comments/1prd013/29_f_30_m_need_advice/,29 F 30 M need advice,"I matched with a guy on hinge 12 days ago. We text for 8 days, met up for a coffee and walked around and ended up making out in the car. Then we meet again 3 days later and do the same thing. Now I normally have dates that don’t include kissing/intimacy so quickly but for some reason this feels different and I feel reckless but also having a really great time which I haven’t done in a while! 

I’m torn between, he does things that are what a guy who is trying to get in your pants does/says or this guy actually likes me and we are clicking like I’ve never had before and is saying everything I’ve wanted to hear without him knowing this.

My instincts are completely terrified and not working in this situation. I can’t tell what is real or not, a lot of this feels like I’m intoxicated while I’m with him (we did smoke weed both times but lightly and it’s not something neither one of us can’t handle) 

 I just want to know what I’m experiencing, because I’m so into this guy but I don’t know anything about him but the things I do know what would normally give me the ick (he doesn’t drive, he didn’t pay for coffee / snacks on both dates though I offered but he didn’t override me, he smokes weed daily, I smoke it here and there but he has a full time job and helps his parents out a lot with bills) but he’s so kind and something about him is so gorgeous and he likes me in a way that I have secretly wanted a guy go like me!! He says all the things that really tickle my fancy and I haven’t liked a guy like this in years! 

I’m worried I’m getting this all wrong and he’s looking for a good time and not a long time OR I’m unable to focus and see this clearly and I’m just going to land myself into trouble (as in sleep with him and he ghosts)

For context: I’m not having sex before marriage, he knows this and we spoke about it twice but our chemistry is so intense and sometimes he kisses me aggressively and I can’t pull away but I don’t necessarily want to pull away and so I’m constantly worried of relaxing because I’m worried I don’t have self control with this guy and I ALWAYS have self control with me but this one is just doing something where I feel 19 again and I think he’s so cute and I haven’t fancied a guy like this in ages and he has some parts of his character which are my cup of tea! He said he respects the no sex thing and has agreed we won’t (which I believe when he said it) 

But I’m concerned for the future and long term what our life will be like financially and with him smoking daily (he has ambitions to buy a house after helping his parents) but when I suggested going for dinner on a second date he said: I don’t mind doing anything with your lovely self, it’s just this month have gave so much for bills, helping family out and then on top of that mortgage, next month gonna be even worse, cause I gotta get the new boiler sorted :/ 😂 so more of an Aladdin to your princes Jasmine at the moment

So I didn’t say anything further because I truly understand humble situations like this but I don’t wanna catch feelings and be that woman that pays more than she should - I don’t mind paying for a guy I like but it seems to have started on a weird precedent ",1,1766232863.0,sexadvise,0,1.0,False

The only row of outlets was taken by a group of people. They were chatting, playing videos out loud, with bags and jackets spread across the entire row, yet only one device was actually plugged in. I stood nearby for a moment. No one looked up. No one said “sorry.”

The old version of me would have quietly walked away, or carried the irritation with me for the rest of the day. But today, I didn’t want to swallow that discomfort. I walked over and said softly, “Sorry, my laptop is about to die. Could I use one of the outlets?” I didn’t accuse them or point out how long they had been there. I simply stated my need.

The air went quiet for two seconds. Then they seemed to realize how much space they had taken. They quickly moved their things, made room, and added a late “sorry.” I noticed a flicker of awkwardness on their faces. It wasn’t the defensiveness of being attacked, but the discomfort of being seen.

I sat down and plugged in my laptop. Somehow, I felt more recharged than my computer. I realized that speaking up for myself doesn’t have to be sharp. Sometimes, gentleness itself is a boundary. Not to embarrass others, but to stop stepping back.

This feels like another small piece of growing up. Not loud. Not silent. Just standing calmly and clearly where I belong.",1,1766232807.0,TheBigGirlDiary,0,1.0,False

He eases his foot off the accelerator.

The engine hum softens. Gravel replaces asphalt. The countryside presses closer now, heavier with memory.

Her throat tightens as recognition creeps in.

It is the same café at the turn of the road where they had coffee the previous day. The same woman. Alive. Standing there. Looking at her with concern. The woman asks if she is looking for something. Her husband stands beside her, watching quietly.

The sky suggests early morning, yet the light feels wrong.

Her heart races. She forces herself to think calmly.

They drove for hours. She must have been too tired to notice things clearly last night. She is still half asleep.

The ground feels unsteady beneath her feet.

She steadies herself and sits on a nearby bench. The boy continues playing, chatting freely, as if nothing is unusual. He talks about school, his friends, and his dreams. She listens, holding back tears she doesn’t fully understand.

Eventually, she joins in, kicking the football a little too hard. The boy trips over it, and her heart lurches. She cries out herself in sudden pain, guilt and worry flooding her.

She rushes to him without a second thought. She tears a piece of cloth from her sleeve, carefully wraps it around his scraped knee, and draws him into a hug. He leans into her, tiny hands clutching her jacket. She hums softly, pressing her cheek to his hair, feeling his small warmth and trust. Slowly, his sobs ease into quiet sniffles.

They sit together on the grass.

The boy looks up at her. She meets his gaze. Those eyes… she could drown in them. She has seen them before every day but never like this. Her hand rises instinctively, brushing back the hair on his forehead. Her fingers trace the faint scar he got at five. She knows it. She recognizes it. Her tears spill onto his small hand before she can stop them.

The boy tilts his head, concerned. “What’s wrong? Why are you crying?”

She shakes her head, voice soft. “Nothing… I was just remembering someone I really love.”

He smiles innocently. “Then he must be lucky.”

He doesn’t realize that the person she loves is the boy sitting in front of her.

He pulls out a piece of paper from his pocket and begins drawing. She watches quietly as a figure slowly takes shape.

A woman.

From the perspective of a seven-year-old boy, her eyes are wide and curious, full of gentle wonder. Her hair falls softly across her shoulders. Her lips curve with a quiet kindness. The image radiates warmth, like someone who could make a stranger feel safe. Even in rough strokes, she feels like home.

She asks, voice barely above a whisper, “Who is she?”

He lowers his gaze. “I don’t know… But she feels like home. I saw her in my dream last night.”

Then he looks up at her and smiles. “You… you look just like her. So pretty.”

She laughs softly, a mixture of shyness and amusement. “Maybe… I’m someone you’ll meet soon.”

Suddenly, a loud honk breaks the quiet.

“Peep! Peep!”

His school bus pulls up. The conductor calls for him.

He grabs his football and the drawing, starts running toward the bus… then pauses. He looks back at her, runs toward her again, and hands her the drawing and the football. She bends down to pick up the ball, and he plants a quick kiss on her cheek. Then he dashes toward the bus, waving once over his shoulder. And in a moment he vanishes like a butterflies in the autumn

She stands frozen for a moment, heart pounding, feeling a rush of warmth and longing she cannot explain.

She decides to go home.

She reaches the front door and opens it.

A flash of light blinds her.

She stumbles inside.

Those same eyes.

That same voice.

“Where have you been so long? I was waiting for you.”

No it isn’t the kid.

It’s her boyfriend. The same boy, older now.

She looks at him. The voice matches perfectly. The same voice that spoke to her in the park.

She clutches the drawing.

Her breath trembles.

He looks at the ball and the sketch, eyes widening. The same football, the same drawing… He can hardly believe it.

Memories flood back. “So what I thought was just a memory all these years… growing up… it was real?”

He steps closer and kisses her. She cries into his arms. He strokes her hair gently, whispering comfort, then hands her the ball.

“Do you know how to play football?” he asks softly.

She nods through tears.

“Good,” he says, smiling. “This time… you can hit me as hard as you want. I won’t cry this time i promise”

1prcqig,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1prcqig/aita_for_apologising_7_years_later/,AITA for apologising 7 years later?,"Hi Morgan and fellow THT listeners! I’m a long time listener but first time writer and I would like to share my story where I truly fucked up, and it has become such a lesson in my life. It’s going to be a long one sorry about that.

I have made some bad decisions when I was 15, I think, or 16 years old.

For context in the story. I’m part asian, part European, and during my teenage years I was close to a girl, let’s call her Tina who is only a few years younger than me. She and I met and became close. Our mums were besties and they often had wine nights at each other homes. We didn’t go to the same school so this was the only time I could hangout with her. Her mum was also pretty strict at the time and didn’t let us have sleepovers. Because she was younger than me she was more like my lil sister.

In Asian culture when you’re younger you kinda have to address the older person as big bro or sis, and she would address me so. I quickly grew to have this older sibling love for her, as I’m the youngest in my siblings it felt good to be looked up to by someone, and be the one to take care of them. We kinda became besties ourselves in a way. Her mum liked me and enjoyed seeing us spending time with each other. So, overtime she allowed sleepovers but only if I was the one sleeping over.

The thing is, I was a very rebellious kid I started drinking, smoking and partying when I was 12 and I was even crazier at 15 / 16. This is also cus my parents were fighting a lot and basically home sucked and my older sister and I aren’t close, so I was always out of the house doing stupid shit cus I had to do something with all my teenage frustrations and apparently a lot of my friends did too. We come from a background of a lot of childhood traumas with fucked up parents, even Tina.

Anyway, the night I was going to sleep over at hers my friends invited me to party and I had the stupid idea to invite Tina with me. Show her the ropes, teach her a few things about partying etc. I taught her how to smoke cigarettes, what to wear to parties, and how to party basically. She was keen as any young teenager would. A very bad influence I know but it felt good to be kinda like the experienced big sis, and we had so much fun together. Obviously I made sure we were safe and be home in one piece.

Once the night was over we went back to hers, and had to find a way to sneak back into her room. We went out through the window to go out, so I made sure the window wasn’t locked so we could sneak back in. But somehow Idk if we made noise or whatever, her mum walked into the room the moment we wanted to crawl back in the window and I quickly got back down. It was still dark in the room so I assumed she didn’t see but she turned on the lights and called out her name. We knew were fucked, her mum walked outside from the front door and called us back into the house. She told me to go wait in her room while she had a talk with her daughter.

Moments passed and the entire time I was like “Fuck she’s gonna snitch on me and MY mum will fuck ME up.” But when she came into the room she looked down and didn’t say anything. I asked her if everything is ok and what she said to her mum. She told me everything is fine, and that she’s grounded and nothing else. So, we got ready for bed and I went home the next morning. Her mum didn’t even look at me when I said goodbye. Which I get, I influenced her young daughter to party with me.

Time went by and our friendship became distant as her mum made her stay at her dad’s, which was far from my house and we barely got to see each other cus of that. This is also cus her mum finally told my mum what happened, but my mum defended me even though she kinda knew what I did, and they stopped being close themselves. I guess my mum didn’t want to be seen as the one for having a “problem child”.

Anyway, I felt guilty and really bad about what had happened. But over time Tina also became rebellious herself. Idrk if it was truly my influence that made her this way, cus her friends also started asking her to go out and stuff. Plus her dad wasn’t very attentive, so she basically could get away with it. I also started to get worried and bothered by how she was going about it. She was partying with people I didn’t like cus they were worst than me, doing drugs and just putting themselves in settings I wouldn’t have put her or myself.

I told her I didn’t like how she was partying and said that if she really wanted to have fun. Just go with me and my friends, cus we weren’t as extreme as the rest. But she kept going and started having a reputation for herself. Sleeping around and just recklessly partying.

Fast forward, she started dating this guy, Tom let’s say. He was nice and down to earth didn’t party much and was good to her. She was beginning to get bored of him and planned to break up with him which she told me about a lot. I told her why wait around to do it might as well do it sooner than later. She said the sex was too good or whatever.

Then, there was a high school graduation party where I was invited to, but Tina wasn’t cus they didn’t want her there due to her “ratchet” reputation. She wasn’t bothered by it cus she was planning to go to another party anyway. So, I went and saw Tom there. He was dangerously flirting with me and kept eyeing me all night. Talking to me, getting me drinks and all that. I was also very drunk and had problems with my own bf at the time. It felt nice for someone to be really into me, and I quickly felt too comfortable with his flirting. Later that night we kissed and made out nothing more cus I didn’t want to even though he was keen. I knew what I was doing was so wrong cus I thought of her instantly and knew she wasn’t going to be happy, obviously, but somehow I thought “what’s the harm, she’s not into him anymore and wanted to break up anyway. I’ll just tell her about it in the morning.”

Morning came, and I got caught. Someone at the party saw and told Tina about it. Which I should’ve known. My reaction was so weird, I was so scared about it but reacted like I was above it all. I told her she was dramatic for being upset and explained that she was making drama out of nothing. Ofc they quickly broke up after that, and I never continued with him even though he slid into my DMs a lot. Our friendship ended then and there and I acted like it didn’t affect me. Idk why I didn’t care and thought it wasn’t a big deal. I found out that I was basically deflecting and coped with my mistake by shrugging it off like it wasn’t a big deal. I was so stupid. She was nothing but nice and a loyal friend and plus where did my sibling love go? How was I not apologetic and guilty about it.

I guess I thought that next year I’ll be gone anyway, I’m graduating and will be going to uni abroad, so all this drama was going to be done and gone. I wasn’t going to see her for a while anyway. When I moved out, I wasn’t at all focused on my life back home. I was so focused on living my life abroad and studying, I didn’t even think about our friendship during that time. Covid happened and I didn’t get to go home for 3 years so a lot of my friendships became estranged. I was also so focused on my first ever committed relationship, I also had a lot of problems with my depression, and overall life wasn’t good at the time, I guess it was my karma.

Year 2023, I finally went back home but never bothered to fix my mistakes with Tina. I thought with time her wounds would’ve healed and it’s been a long time anyway why dwell on it. She probably didn’t want to hear from me and would rather not deal with it anymore.

Then 7 years passed, I was back home out with a friend from high school and she asked me about Tina, and what happened to us. I was shocked in a way and asked how she knows about me and Tina. She said a common friend of hers and Tina mentioned about me, and how I’m a bitch for doing something like that to a good friend. I suddenly got flashbacks and realised, “wtf was actually wrong with me?”. So, I told my friend about what I did and she was understanding and quiet about it. From then one I couldn’t stop thinking of Tina and what happened. I started stalking Tina on Instagram, we were still following each other so I still got updates about her and her life here and there.

After seeing her updates, it reminded me how she is as a person. I started missing her, missing my friend. I went on a spiral and thought, I should’ve actually done something ages ago and is it too late to do something now? I guess seeing her made me feel like I could’ve been in her life and gone through life together, ages ago? Like if I have fixed what I did before we could’ve grown up together? Flourish together? I saw that she’s married, working closely with her mum helping the business. I felt like I could’ve actually been a part of all of those achievements and celebrated it with her.

I know that it was so odd of me to realise so late after. I guess it just hit me to start thinking of her instead of what’s going on with my life. Like once my life actually calmed down and I was starting to settle down as an adult, growing up, being mature and overcoming my depression. I finally had time to think of her and what I did. I felt that maybe I should make it right, now. Rekindling friendships that were strained before. Maybe I can rekindle ours, and maybe she could teach me a valuable lesson about this?

I finally had the courage to face her. I was avoiding it a lot. I was scared that she would think my guilt was all bs and that I’m just doing this for myself. Idk maybe I am? Is it too late to feel bad now and not before? Anyway, I messaged her asking if she would want to meet up for coffee or something I thought that a f2f apology would make up for loss time. I was wrong, cus she gave it to me good. She said, “why apologise now when it took you 7 years to do so?” Which is fair I said, I told her all my reasons and I wasn’t pushing for forgiveness that was all up to her. She explained that she’s over it, that she’s happy where she’s at now, and doesn’t really see or need for us to be close anymore. She sees what kind of person I am and that she’s accepted it. She says she’s good with how things are and there’s no need for me to apologise.

I mean what did I expect really. I would be the same, I felt like that I didn’t do my apology justice though. Like I didn’t truly show her how truly sorry I am. My explanation wasn’t really that good either. I tried typing but was shaking the whole time so did a VM instead, but listening back my voice sounded so nonchalant. Why am I like this?!

Should I try again? I mean there are moments here and there where we would chat briefly about something through Insta stories but that’s it. I don’t really see us being close, I just wanted to be friends again in a way. I mean, I know I shouldn’t force it, she clearly set a boundary already. I just feel like I haven’t fully atoned, cus I felt my apology wasn’t very meaningful.

In the end, I know I’m the asshole and I guess I just needed to vent. Every time I think of her I just get engulfed with guilt. I want to fix my mistakes. Solve the problem. But is there even a problem to be solved? Is it just me? Should I just let it go and move on? Is it even worth it now?

Let me know what you guys think. I’ve done therapy here and there, and was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid but never got deeper into it. My therapist in uni said I might have some kind of personality disorder but didn’t want to diagnose it. Psychological therapy etc, is expensive. I guess I’ll get more into it when I can afford it in the future.",1,1766231940.0,TwoHotTakes,4,0.66,False

I attempted to order an iced long black with creamer — a drink that is spiritually, physically, and emotionally possible — yet I was informed this could not be done because “the system won’t allow it.”

And yet… the creamer exists.
I saw her.
She was right there.

At this point I must ask: why is creamer only permitted to live its truth inside Jacked Up sodas? Why is coffee excluded from this creamy utopia? What law is being upheld here?

I was happy to pay extra. I was happy to wait. I was happy to watch someone press several buttons with hope in their heart. But alas, I was denied.

Please consider adding creamer as an option for coffee drinks so future customers don’t have to stand at the counter silently recalculating their entire understanding of fast-food logistics.

Free the creamer.

1prcojo,https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/features/news-briefs/starbucks-baristas-take-strike-to-companys-seattle-hq-as-labor-and-political-support-expands,Starbucks Baristas Take Strike to Company’s Seattle HQ as Labor and Political Support Expands,"Hundreds of members of the Starbucks Workers United union, who have been on strike since Nov. 13 as part of the Red Cup Rebellion over what the union claims are unfair labor practices (ULP), took their protests directly to the coffee giant’s Seattle headquarters on Dec. 18.

Baristas from the region were joined by SEIU 1199NW, MLK Labor, Teamsters Joint Council 28, Seattle Indivisible, Students Against Starbucks and the Washington State Democratic Party, all showing their support for the ongoing labor action. A truck driven by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters was parked in solidarity behind the crowd, blaring its horn in support as baristas shared their stories of alleged union-busting and their personal struggles to make ends meet while working for Starbucks.

The strike began on Nov. 13, 2025, Starbucks’ Red Cup Day — the retailer’s traditional holiday kickoff date — and had expanded to 180 Starbucks stores by Dec. 11, 2025. By Dec. 18, additional unionized stores in 28 cities had joined the strike.

The Red Cup Rebellion has been gaining allies ranging from Hollywood’s SAG-AFTRA union and AFL-CIO members in Los Angeles, NAACP leaders in St. Louis and teachers in Arlington, Va. Additionally, more than 180 state and local elected officials, including Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown and nine Seattle and Washington State lawmakers, sent a letter to Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol on Dec. 17 supporting the union and urging the retailer to finalize a fair union contract.

Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson had provided emailed commentary from the company in early November, before the strike officially began, indicating Starbucks’ willingness to talk: “We are disappointed that Workers United, who only represents around 4% of our partners, has voted to authorize a strike instead of returning to the bargaining table. When they’re ready to come back, we’re ready to talk. Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners. The facts show people like working at Starbucks.”",8,1766231736.0,union,0,1.0,False

But I bought a special set of brushes and felt around all the invisible corners to make sure I was getting all the gunk out. Even then, by the end of the week the brew group and drip tray would be disgusting, and even worse, come September and I would open the door fungus flies would come pouring out and hang around our kitchen.

I figured the summers almost over, but the weather got colder and the problem persisted. Spent countless hours scouring the internet for solutions to the problem, tried them all and still couldn’t figure it out.

Deep in a years old buried post on this subreddit with a handful of comments, I struck gold. You won’t find this in anything official, any manual, or any video.

*THE PRE-GROUND COFFE CHUTE*

Pulled the Maschine out, shined a flash light down there, and was absolutely horrified and disgusted. We drink primarily espresso, and to get a decent shot I have it set to the lowest grind setting. 

/The chute was absolutely encrusted with fine damp coffee powder, thick, disgusting fluffy mold and those nasty flies./

Needless to say, cleaning the chute is now part of my weekly routine, and even then I notice that it just as quickly fills up with powder. To think every drink I pulled was going through this part of the machine makes my stomach turn.

Don’t be like me. If you haven’t looked down your chute recently, be prepared to be shocked.

In many homes across the Middle East, the coffee table isn’t just a functional piece; it’s the centerpiece of hospitality. It’s where conversations happen, tea or Arabic coffee is served, and guests are welcomed.

What makes these tables unique is the craftsmanship. Traditional artisans use techniques like mother-of-pearl inlay, bone inlay, and intricate carvings that have been passed down for generations. Each table tells a story, not mass‑produced, but handcrafted with cultural heritage built into the design.

I recently came across [Levantiques](https://levantiques.com/), a brand that curates luxury handcrafted furniture inspired by this tradition. Their Middle Eastern coffee tables blend artistry with functionality, making them perfect for anyone who wants to bring a touch of cultural authenticity into their living space. Honestly, it’s not just about owning a table; it’s about owning a piece of history and craftsmanship that connects you to centuries of tradition.

If you’re into interior design or just love furniture that has meaning, I’d recommend checking out their collection. It’s amazing how a single piece like a coffee table can transform a room and spark conversations about culture and heritage.",1,1766231666.0,u_samir-homejournal,0,1.0,False

1prcht8,https://i.redd.it/nro40yonjc8g1.jpeg,Solutions to your rok problems,"So I’ve been through a lot of trial and error to fix my (and maybe yours too) rokpresso problems. The thing I encounter the most are:

1. Pressure leak (followed bu water leak) around the porta

 when pressing down

1. Channeling/uneven extraction
2. Portafilter unscrewing/loosened by itself
3. Portafilter tabs/ears breaking
4. Underextraction
5. Difficult/unable to push down the rok handle

And here are the things that I found to help fix all of the problems above

\- Always preheat portafilter (Helps 1, 2, 3, 5)

\- Buy a porta that’s made out of metal, the og rok is made from zinc alloy and chinese knockoffs are mostly aluminium and I’ve broken 3 or 4 this year. The metal one enables the porta to be screwed in more tightly without worrying about breaking (or being worn out) and prevents pressure and water leak (Helps 1, 3, 4)

\- Use the competition screen (orange one) with the addition of silicone ring as shown below. The silicone ring helps secure the porta and prevent pressure leaks, I use 2mm silicone sheet and cut it to size (Helps 1, 2, 3)

\- Give the o ring in the chamber food grade lube or olive oil to make it waay easier to push down, if you’re asking if the oil will alter/affect the flavor or notes of coffee honestly idk but to me it made no difference (6)

1prcgqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1prcgqk/aitah_for_not_contributing_to_my_family/,AITAH for not contributing to my family?,"I (31F) and my husband (34 M) have 2 kids ages 3 & 19 months. We live in a tiny rural town close to where I grew up and bought our house 4 years ago after we got married and I became pregnant with our first child. Anyways, things have been fairly good for the most part. My husband and I get along well, but there’s no depth it feels to our relationship. He grew up with an overly emotional and dramatic mom while his dad worked away so he doesn’t do emotion. He always says “meh” when I ask how he’s feeling or if he’s stressed or try to start a conversation based on feelings about an event or upcoming job or anything. So, our conversations tend to mostly be about our kids and things we find funny but never anything that bonds us or grows our relationship. 

So, that leads me into the conversation that happened yesterday morning. He let me sleep in until 9:30am (which was super nice of him) and he got up with the kids around 7:30am. He made them breakfast and then was watching cartoons with them when I came out of the bedroom. I work from home as a custom leather worker and had someone coming to pick up an order and let him know and then proceeded to tell him our neighbor would be coming for coffee. She’s next door and a good friend so he enjoys her company too. He seemed to be in a normal mood but then says “I didn’t make much money this month so I need you to start paying some bills.” I’m a SAHM and work during my daughter’s nap time and then after the kids go to bed. I have a lot of overhead costs and don’t really make any money, but in months that I do, I use that money to pay off my credit cards and put some in savings in case my horses (kept at my parents farm nearby) have any unexpected vet bills. I cover their expenses by myself (hay, board, farrier, vet, etc). So, I get defensive when it comes to my husband asking me for money. I know I could probably handle it better, but I told him I don’t really have any money as I don’t really have an income. He said he got a vasectomy (a week ago and that’s why he’s home from work - physical job) and he didn’t even want to now or ever because he knew he would have to take time off work and things would be tight. I stared at him and started to get tears in my eyes. We talked about the vasectomy since our daughter was born and he said he was good with it. Even the night before the appointment I asked him about it and he said he didn’t feel any way about it and was fine with getting it done. But yesterday he immediately threw it in my face that he didn’t want to get it and now that he has been off work I need to cover the bills and start paying for my phone bill and electricity every month. I had offered in the past to pay at least for my phone as it felt weird not to, but he insisted he didn’t care and would pay it. Then he asks me for his half of the child benefit cheque I get every month (around $950). I told him no. That money is for the primary parent and that’s me. I use that money for buying presents, things for myself like haircuts or the odd clothing item, etc. I don’t get my nails done, my hair is my natural colour, I don’t have fake lashes, Botox, etc. I don’t buy a coffee every day or anything but he vapes, is hiding cigarettes from me so I think he’s smoking again and he buys Pepsi every day. So I got defensive and put my foot down and said no. He said every other couple splits it and I just keep it for myself. Then said he puts a lot of strain on his body to do his job and I immediately told him I suffered through two brutal pregnancies and birthed our kids unmedicated and still suffer from that in some ways. He rolled his eyes and said he wouldn’t bother talking to me about this stuff anymore. He said he made only around $2000 this month and I should be contributing but I refused. I already take care of our kids full time while running my business and barely sleeping. If we were in debt or financially in trouble I would help, but we aren’t. As far as I know we have a decent amount of money sitting in his account (I don’t see what he makes or what he spends as he just puts some money in a joined account monthly for me to use for the kids).

1prcge4,https://i.redd.it/vi2zks88jc8g1.jpeg,Stupid question so feel free to judge but is this going to kill me? Never felt this much anxiety in my life,"I’m trying to get this infected wisdom tooth extracted asap, but the places near me haven’t returned my calls to schedule a consultation yet, and I don’t have many options around me so for now I’m just waiting. I’m going to call my dentist and go somewhere today to try to get some antibiotics for it since I’ve read that if left untreated, the infection can spread to my nerves and/or bloodstream and kill me

I know it’s my fault that it got this bad and I accept that, and it won’t happen again. I’ve sworn off sweets and coffee, drink basically just milk and water, brush and floss and then rinse with mouthwash or saltwater, all the stuff I should be doing I do. I try to eat and drink with the opposite side of my mouth as best I can and sleep on the opposite side as well

It doesn’t hurt most of the time. I can eat and drink or do whatever just fine as long as nothing cold or sugary gets on it, but if that happens then I really feel it. Sugar isn’t a problem anymore but I have to be careful drinking because of this. I donate plasma every weekend and the saline causes it to flare up sometimes as well

The problem is that sometimes I do feel it subtly hurt instead of just being excruciating like if I get something cold on it. I’ll inhale or exhale too fast and feel it, maybe I’ll move my mouth too much or I’ll touch it the wrong way while applying oragel around the area, maybe I’ll subconsciously clench or grind my teeth, and every time this happens the anxiety locks me down and nothing gets done all day and night

Every little bit of pain makes me think it’s finally about to hit the nerve and explode into excruciating, unbearable pain, leading me to an emergency dentist and extremely expensive bills or worse. I can never tell if or when this might happen, when it’ll all come to a head and the pain will become the worst I’ve felt in my entire life. I constantly live in fear of this moment finally happening. I’ve lost a ton of sleep over this lately, because if I feel it before falling asleep I worry that I might turn onto the tooth’s side while I sleep and put pressure on it or dislodge it or something, and the lack of sleep has led to extreme tiredness which then leads to even less getting done. I can’t even try to take my mind off it with distractions or my hobbies or something. As soon as I feel something it’s all I think about for hours. I take Motrin, Aleve, and use oragel on it a lot


I can’t take this anymore so I really am trying to get this done now, but in the meantime I need to know what the odds are that it’s too late

*2032. December 20.*

The date glows faintly on the car panel.

The speedometer reads **""80""** as the highway stretches endlessly ahead. He drives steadily, eyes focused, hands relaxed on the wheel. City lights thin out behind them. The air grows quieter with every passing kilometer.

She leans against him in the passenger seat, half asleep, her head resting lightly on his shoulder. She is his long term girlfriend, soon to be his wife. This trip is meant to be simple. A short vacation. A return to his childhood home. A pause before marriage and starting their life together.

His parents no longer live there. The house has been empty for years, kept only out of attachment. That is why he chose it. Just the two of them, away from everything.

The road sign flashes past.

*Highway ends.*

He eases his foot off the accelerator.

The speed drops from **""80""** to **""60""**.

Further ahead, as the road narrows and trees begin to crowd the sides, it shifts again from **""60""** to **""40""**.

The engine hum softens. Gravel replaces asphalt. The countryside presses closer now, heavier with memory.

He talks about the place as they drive. The old park. The narrow roads. The quiet nights. She listens with a tired smile, imagining it through his words.

They stop by a small café near the turn toward the house. It is run by an old man her boyfriend has known since childhood. The café has been there for as long as he can remember. A barrel stands near the counter with a small framed photograph of the man’s wife placed on top. She passed away years ago. The man serves coffee quietly, his face carrying a permanent sadness.

Her boyfriend tips him generously. For a brief moment, the man smiles.

They arrive late.

The house stands exactly as he described. Old walls. Familiar doors. A sense of time slowing down. They eat dinner quietly, sharing stories and small laughter. Travel fatigue settles in. They go to bed. He pulls her close and holds her tightly by the waist. He kisses her gently. Sleep takes them without effort.

It is **6:15 a.m.** when she wakes up and looks at the clock.

A sound carries through the morning air. A dull thud. Repeated. A ball hitting pavement. The sound echoes clearly.

She shifts slightly, still wrapped in his arms. He holds her firmly by the waist. She drifts back toward sleep. The sound repeats again.

A child is playing outside.

She listens for a moment, confused. The house is silent otherwise. She tells herself it must be early morning noise. Still half asleep, she carefully slips out of his hold and sits up.

She gets out of bed.

The hallway feels colder than before. Her footsteps are soft. The front door stands ahead of her. She hesitates, then opens it.

She steps outside.

The air feels different immediately. Cooler. Heavier. The streetlight outside hums faintly, its yellow glow uneven and dull. The houses opposite have faded paint and older designs. Electrical wires sag lower than she remembers, tangled across the poles.

The road surface is rougher. A torn poster clings to a wall nearby. The colors are sun burned. It shows cricketers lifting a trophy, confetti frozen mid air. The words **“India World Champions 2011”** are printed boldly across it. She pauses, staring longer than she should.

That already happened, she thinks. Long ago.

A few steps ahead, another hoarding stands crooked near a tea stall. A smiling face holds up a phone much smaller than the one she owns. **“iPhone 4. This changes everything.”** The edges of the poster are peeling. Dust has settled into the creases.

A woman calls out to her from behind.

She turns.

Her breath catches.

For a moment, she cannot move. The sight of the woman unsettles her in a way she cannot explain. The face, the posture, the familiar warmth in the voice feel wrong in this place and at this time. Her mind struggles to place the memory. She is certain she has seen this woman before.

Her throat tightens as recognition creeps in.

It is the same café at the turn of the road where they had coffee the previous day. The same woman. Alive. Standing there. Looking at her with concern. The woman asks if she is looking for something. Her husband stands beside her, watching quietly.

The sky suggests early morning, yet the light feels wrong.

Her heart races. She forces herself to think calmly.

They drove for hours. She must have been too tired to notice things clearly last night. She is still half asleep.

She walks forward.

The road leads to a small park. The metal of the swings is chipped. The paint on the benches is cracked. Under a flickering streetlight, a single boy stands there, kicking a football against a wall. The sound matches what woke her. Each kick echoes through the empty space

She stops near him.

The boy looks up at her. He cannot be older than ten. A faint scar runs across his forehead, partly hidden by his hair. Something about the curve of his eyes, the shape of his smile, the way he tilts his head it feels uncannily familiar. Not directly, but it tugs at a memory she cannot place, a shadow of the man she knows.

She feels a strange pull, a flutter in her chest. A sense of recognition, inexplicable and deep, grips her.

She asks softly, “What’s your name?”

He answers casually, smiling.

The sound of his voice makes her breath catch. It’s the same voice she knows, the same warmth and rhythm she hears every day. The same tone that feels like home. A sharp wave of nostalgia hits her, as if she has stepped into a memory she didn’t know she had.

The ground feels unsteady beneath her feet.

She steadies herself and sits on a nearby bench. The boy continues playing, chatting freely, as if nothing is unusual. He talks about school, his friends, and his dreams. She listens, holding back tears she doesn’t fully understand.

Eventually, she joins in, kicking the football a little too hard. The boy trips over it, and her heart lurches. She cries out herself in sudden pain, guilt and worry flooding her.

She rushes to him without a second thought. She tears a piece of cloth from her sleeve, carefully wraps it around his scraped knee, and draws him into a hug. He leans into her, tiny hands clutching her jacket. She hums softly, pressing her cheek to his hair, feeling his small warmth and trust. Slowly, his sobs ease into quiet sniffles.

They sit together on the grass.

The boy looks up at her. She meets his gaze. Those eyes… she could drown in them. She has seen them before every day but never like this. Her hand rises instinctively, brushing back the hair on his forehead. Her fingers trace the faint scar he got at five. She knows it. She recognizes it. Her tears spill onto his small hand before she can stop them.

The boy tilts his head, concerned. “What’s wrong? Why are you crying?”

She shakes her head, voice soft. “Nothing… I was just remembering someone I really love.”

He smiles innocently. “Then he must be lucky.”

He doesn’t realize that the person she loves is the boy sitting in front of her.

He pulls out a piece of paper from his pocket and begins drawing. She watches quietly as a figure slowly takes shape.

A woman.

From the perspective of a seven-year-old boy, her eyes are wide and curious, full of gentle wonder. Her hair falls softly across her shoulders. Her lips curve with a quiet kindness. The image radiates warmth, like someone who could make a stranger feel safe. Even in rough strokes, she feels like home.

She asks, voice barely above a whisper, “Who is she?”

He lowers his gaze. “I don’t know… But she feels like home. I saw her in my dream last night.”

Then he looks up at her and smiles. “You… you look just like her. So pretty.”

She laughs softly, a mixture of shyness and amusement. “Maybe… I’m someone you’ll meet soon.”

Suddenly, a loud honk breaks the quiet.

“Peep! Peep!”

His school bus pulls up. The conductor calls for him.

He grabs his football and the drawing, starts running toward the bus… then pauses. He looks back at her, runs toward her again, and hands her the drawing and the football. She bends down to pick up the ball, and he plants a quick kiss on her cheek. Then he dashes toward the bus, waving once over his shoulder. And in a moment he vanishes like a butterflies in the autumn

She stands frozen for a moment, heart pounding, feeling a rush of warmth and longing she cannot explain.

She decides to go home.

She reaches the front door and opens it.

A flash of light blinds her.

She stumbles inside.

Those same eyes.

That same voice.

“Where have you been so long? I was waiting for you.”

No it isn’t the kid.

It’s her boyfriend. The same boy, older now.

She looks at him. The voice matches perfectly. The same voice that spoke to her in the park.

She clutches the drawing.

Her breath trembles.

He looks at the ball and the sketch, eyes widening. The same football, the same drawing… He can hardly believe it.

Memories flood back. “So what I thought was just a memory all these years… growing up… it was real?”

He steps closer and kisses her. She cries into his arms. He strokes her hair gently, whispering comfort, then hands her the ball.

“Do you know how to play football?” he asks softly.

She nods through tears.

“Good,” he says, smiling. “This time… you can hit me as hard as you want. I won’t cry this time i promise”

1prc8vd,https://www.reddit.com/r/transnord/comments/1prc8vd/detailed_orchiectomy_experience_f31_first_time/,Detailed Orchiectomy experience (F31) - first time surgery,"Hello. Here's a very detailed timeline of my orchiectomy experience and the recovery after, with a focus on subjective experience and emotions felt through-out. Disclaimer: This is just my personal experience.

Medical history background: My transgender journey started in 2012 (19 yo) right away with self-medding route of spiro/estradiol tablets. I got an official transgender diagnosis in 2015 and switched to government-funded cypro/estradiol patches, until 2019 when I decided to 'de-transition' by stopping cypro and then estradiol. Bad choice in hindsight. I lived on testosterone again up until 2023 when I started using using estradiol patches again, and then switched to DIY injection in 2024, and have been on monotherapy estradiol for the past 1,5 years as of writing this document. I got in contact with an endochronologist who helped me check my estradiol injections levels and provided me a contact to an urologist for an orchiectomy, covered under government healthcare.

Timeline for healthcare:

* March 2025: Referral created for two urologists in the country.
* May 2025: One of the urologists replied and accepted my referral.
* August 2025: Personal meeting with my urologist to discuss the procedure. I was asked whether I'd want to leave the scrotal tissue behind, which I said yes.
* November 2025: I received a phone call with a time for the operation at 19th December.
* December 19, 2025: Orchiectomy operation happened.

Before the operation: To prep myself for it, I read a bunch of orchiectomy experiences, one in particular that took place in this country (although from a private clinic). My impression from reading all of these experiences was that there could be a lot of blood, pain, and discomfort through the whole process. Combined with the fact that I had never had any surgery or been put under any aenesthesia, I became quite nervous, but I'm happy to report that my experience seems to have been comparatively better; both before and after surgery has been pleasant all through-out.

The day before: I filled out some papers I had to take with me with my rooomate; which had some questions about previous aenesthesia experiences, average blood pressure, weight and height, my stamina/physical fitness, and if I had any existing health conditions. I then went to buy an extra cold pack just in case, stopped eating about 12 hours before the operation (I was recommended 6 hours, but just for safety I picked 12), and popped a melatonin to sleep. I didn't sleep very well, woke up at 04.00 with 6 hours of sleep. Turns out I had forgotten to read the specific paper asking me to call a week before to report that I'd go to my surgery, but I called in the morning and it was still OK, so we were off. I sipped very little on juice on the way.

\--- Surgery experience

I arrived slightly too late to the reception (11:00) and was worried if it'd be okay (it was). I submitted my papers, my ID, and had my information digitally registered. I sat down in a lobby room, and was then asked to change in to hospital clothes - quite uncomfortable, cheap, plastic feeling clothes and lock my items in to a locker. At this point (11:10) my partner had to split from me, and in the haste left my documents and phone with her (didn't have to, oops). I had to strip down all of my own clothes and replace with hospital undies, pants, grippy socks, shirt, and slippers. I was also given a warm big orange blanket. I really liked that blanket, by my wish to take it home was rejected.

Anyways, I sat down in the lobby and waited for my surgeon, which promptly came (\~11:30) and invited me to a room where we talked about the procedure again. I asked when I would be leaving, which he predicted would be in a few hours, around 15:00-16:00. He explained again that a standard cut will be made along the middle of the sack. I asked about the cords connecting to the testicles, and they were going to be cut as high as possible. Other than that, the communication felt professional, straight forward, if a bit formal, and then I returned back to the lobby couch looking positively yet nervous for a new experience.

I waited in the lobby for about an hour (\~12:30). It was probably the most nervous I felt so far, due to the uncomfortable temperature with my hospital clothes and the chilly room, but I snuggled up to the blanket just fine. I watched as patients were rolled in and out of what appeared to be a main prepping room with only nurses. I got quite fidgety playing the unknown future in my head, but just kept myself relaxed, open and not too scared. Eventually, I was called up, and had to leave my glasses and in return was given a key around my arm; I was led in to that prepping room to lay down on a hospital bed.

There, the nurses put an IV catheter in my left hand, on the upper side. It stung a fair amount, but entirely manageable when I looked away. Honestly, the bed was already very comfortable, as I had my orange blanket and a thicker, warmer blanket on top, making it very warm. Eventually (\~12:45) the aenesthician came up, asked if I had ever been put under any aenesthesia, I said no, and he explained the sedation procedure in a similar professional, although rushed manner (he didn't know many English words, but I assured him back that it was okay) explaining how I'd be put in a mask while having IV drips. A few minutes later (\~12:50) they started rolling the bed to the operation room.

In the operating room, there were about 5-6 people walking around and preparing for the surgery and were all looking away. I was told to stand, take off my pants and underwear, and lay down on to the surgical bed. A helpful nurse held the orange blanket around me to shield the view. I laid down and the blanket was kept on the lower part of my body, and my legs and hips were adjusted by another nurse to be in the correct position with foam shapes and my arms were spread apart. From my view up, I could see the aenesthician on my upper right, and to the left, was the same nurse holding the blanket but assisting him. I saw a transparent IV drip pack, of what I presume the aenesthesia, and felt the needle of it enter my hand catheter. A clamp was put on my middle left finger to monitor blood pressure. The aenesthician remarked that my vital signs looked good, and I was just taking it all in - the classic operating table lamp above, the blue, cold tones of the room and the clothing, and the somewhat uncomfortable room temperature.

The aenesthician explained once again that it'd take about 30 seconds to feel the sedation kick in. I was told to just calmly breathe through an oxygen mask he was holding, so he put it on my face, and I could clearly sense the fresh smell of oxygen... it was kinda 'tasty' and I had no problems breathing it in. Meanwhile, his assistant did something off my eye's corner, but I kept focusing on the oxygen. It felt like it went more than 30 seconds but eventually, very slowly at first, but then somehwat quickly, I felt a wave of dazedness/sleepiness wash over me. It's quite similar to the feeling of melatonin taking effect but without the actual human drowsiness, and I distinctly remember the voices and commotion quickly sounding fainter and warping, a little but hallucinatory, in the funny way. It was gentle, and soothing, and I felt nothing but just pleasant normality in my mind before a few seconds passed and I passed out.

The operation took place from 13:07 to 13:24. I don't remember what the clock was when I woke up, but I suspect it was between 13:30 to 14:00. The sedation felt like a time skip, as if I was knocked unconscious with no dreams or thoughts. I suddenly woke up in another recovery room with two nurses next to me handling my blankets, and I felt clearly myself to be very confused and very cold, unsure if the surgery had even happened. They had a heat pump machine next to me that I immediately asked for it to be put under my blanket. The hot air going over my body felt extremely pleasant, comforting and nice, and I would've huddled to it before I came to my senses. I realized I couldn't move, I felt very weak, and there was a sharp, prominent pain from the lower belly. It felt pretty harsh, on a scale from 1-10, I would rate it 5. It felt a bit like a really bad case of blue balling and a small knife twisting in my lower gut.

I asked for an IV painkiller which was injected in to me, but it didn't do much of an effect, however, as I was recollecing and organizing my thoughts, I realized that I indeed had made my operation, and I was wondering if it had gone well. I also noticed that the recovery room was a bit more pleasantly darker and calmer than the hectic surgery room. I reflected on what I last remembered and found that I remembered everything pretty well in good detail. Eventually, my surgeon visited me (\~14:00), and described how the operation went competely fine as expected, and that there was nothing to worry about. I thanked him for his work after not realizing that he was indeed my surgeon. I continued laying there asking for two more IV painkiller drops, which knocked down the pain from a 5 to a 3, becoming less of a knife twist and more like an annoying, persistent ache as the ever present confusion slowly sorted itself out.

Eventually, I was told to go to another recovery room (\~14:15), at which point I was told to raise myself from the bed and sit on the wheelchair. I realized how painful it was, but I took it very slow with the help of the nurses, and I was physically able to stand, but I moved like a snail. The pains started to come in waves instead, at some point it was a strong 4, and at other points it was a strong 3. Most of all, I felt really tired and dizzy. They wheeled me out to the other recovery room, where I had to move myself to a normal chair and they gave me really nice stuff - water, juice, cookies, and a tasty yoghurt. Honestly, after 12 hours of starving, I was wolfing it down. I looked at the clock which was about 14:30, and I took my time eating, resting, and feeling my way through this experience for about an hour.

The most striking thoughts I had during that hour was that it really didn't feel as bad as I had imagined it to be. It felt like a really simple, straight forward procedure, and that in reality, I had nothing to worry about at all. The most physically uncomfortable moment was mostly the post-op recovery - my crotch still felt quite persistently and annoying painful, and I felt really tired, weak, dizzy and cold, and the body temperature regulation felt really broken - I leaned back on my chair and the back had glued itself to the chair from sweat, causing me to feel nausea. It was a bit annoying dealing with this because I couldn't tell how to resolve it. Another unexpected feeling was a sense of happiness, but I wasn't sure if it was from the sedative, or if there was a sense of resolution.

My partner came to visit me at 15:30 along with my phone. We chatted a bit, she commented that my lips looked a little blue and my face white. It makes sense, because I was just starting to sip a hot coffee that made me feel really sick and frantic, and I couldn't figure out why. I ended up actually throwing up a bit in my water mug (how embarrassing, with people around, but thankfully I did so quietly). I then realized how hot I actually was, so I leaned forward and let my back ventilate, after a minute or two I felt much better and was able to focus again. I had to sit in this room for another 1-1,5 hours to recover enough to be able to stand. But I took it easy, chatted, rested, and walked around a bit, talking about how I felt and thought. Before we left, I went to my locker, and put on my clothes again. As I was doing it I saw the brown stains on my thighs and belly (presumably from some sort of anti bacterial fluid) and felt a strange sticky feeling on my inner thigh that came from the head, which looked like very sticky pre-cum liquid. I simply wiped it off and put a paper in my own underwear. There was no bleeding at all, just a regular, sticky bandage put near the incision area.

We then left by borrowing a wheelchair and sitting me in it (\~16:50) and rolling all the way to our car, conveniently parked nearby. The journey home was uneventful, but also reflective; I felt the annoying pain all through-out the trip, but leaning the car seat back made it bearable. There was a strange, sobering thought through-out it, which was simply happiness, happy that I did a decision for myself that I've been wanting to do for the past ten years, happy that I can look and feel closer to what I want. I totally did not expect it, and I suppose it was because I had numbed myself all these years; and of course, the hormone monotherapy had disabled them, so I wasn't that distraught - I thought I wanted them gone mostly for their sensitivity, pain, and in general being ugly and in the way. But I think knowing that they're now permanently gone - it gives me a very pleasant, thorough enjoyment! It simply feels like one less thing to worry about in my life, and it's something I should've gotten earlier.

We arrived home, I wobbled my way to the door (regular walking was fine, but slow), and laid down in my bed - eating a tasty filling soup and drinking a juice. I was entirely capable of standing up, walking a little, cooking things for myself; but I couldn't move or carry heavier things. I tried using the toilet, but the pissing was very slow and felt obstructed, so I didn't push or anything. I just took it easy, covered myself in blanket and had a nice sleep.",3,1766230079.0,transnord,0,1.0,False

After doomscrolling all these posts on various dating, relationship and sex advice subs on Reddit about people yapping about their love lives and issues in that, I thought I will take a break by going for lunch before attending classes (I am a PG student)

And i go and sit with a couple of my friends in my college cafe, and these two are discussing all their past flings, crushes, breakups and past relationships...

To make matters worse, they turned to me and asked me to share stuff.... I laughed it off and said I had nothing to share... (and i ACTUALLY don't - like literally nothing casual or serious...)

While on the walk to my classes, I felt so disgusted with myself, like I was some roach which has been so undesirable which has been approached by nobody else... everybody says I am nice and talented and whatnot... but no one has shown me romantic interest and I have also stayed away from the same, God knows why... 

So yeah, after walking a few paces, I just skipped classes, sat down behind my college football ground and cried like, so hard... hoping nobody comes along and spots me crying like a baby...

After a good one hour, I got back up and attended the pending class and now typing this with a cup of coffee, maybe just a little better but nonetheless...my pain remains...

I will be moving to a tier 1 city for a job, hope things get better but rn struggling so much...

1prc51q,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1prc51q/dealing_with_a_coworker_who_pushes_for_friendship/,Dealing with a coworker who pushes for friendship - feeling pressured,"I started a new job last year. One of the new colleagues got in touch with me relatively quickly (he had also just started) and would occasionally ask whether we should grab a coffee or have lunch together. It quickly became apparent that he also likes to make contact outside of work. He invited me to private parties, get-togethers, etc., and would now and then ask if we should do something together. That would all be half as bad - but here’s the problem:

Unfortunately I really can’t get on with his personality. He comes across to me as very superficial and almost narcissistic. In conversations, for example, I quickly noticed that he isn’t really interested in what I say (for instance, one day we talked about university and the next day he asked in a conversation what I had actually studied although I had already told him). He also holds social/political views I don’t share, and he likes to gossip about other colleagues whom I actually think are quite nice.

Once I went out for drinks with him and a few of his own friends. It was alright - actually better than I expected; I wanted to give it a chance. But my impression of his personality turned out to be correct. I notice that it simply doesn’t fit.

On top of that, I already have trouble keeping up my existing friendships and meeting regularly. So I really don’t need a new friendship that I’m not even interested in.

A few days ago I was invited to his birthday. I actually had to turn down because I was already going to be out that day. He replied, “Too bad you never make suggestions.” I then tried to explain that my social capacity is simply used up right now and I can’t meet those expectations. I stayed polite and even apologised (instead of being direct and saying I’m just not interested and we don’t match). He showed no understanding - just a very strange “Okay, then fine. Bye.”

I don’t know what to make of it. It annoys me that I’m apparently expected to deliver something - an obligation I shouldn’t have in the first place and don’t want to fulfil. That doesn’t strike me as a healthy friendship. And, as I said, I’m not interested in a deep friendship anyway.

At work we don’t actually see each other much because our working hours are different. Unfortunately we’ll still run into each other there from time to time (not until a few weeks into the new year, though). But it’s also possible that we may work together more closely in the future. And I don’t want this to become an awkward situation. Who knows, maybe it could even work as a friendly connection - but not like that.

Have you ever had similar experiences and do you have any tips for me? How should I best behave? Maybe I’m being too strict and should give it a chance?

Quick background:

	•	Tried black and with milk, but I prefer it with milk.

	•	Beans I’ve tried: Blue Tokai Silver Oak, Dhak, Vienna — Vienna roast is my favorite so far.

	•	Current kit: French press + Timecore C2 grinder.

	•	My usual method: 20 g ground coffee + \~150 ml water brewed in the French press, then I add another 120 ml milk to the cup and 13 g sugar.

	•	I don’t mind the little sediments from the French press ,

I just stir with a spoon while drinking.

Now I’m thinking of getting an espresso machine so I can pull espresso and then add milk (latte-style). I can spend up to 25k (INR). Questions I have:

	1.	Is buying an espresso machine the right next step if my main goal is milk coffee (latte/cappuccino-style), or is there a better/cheaper path?

	2.	If an espresso machine makes sense, what type should I get for ₹25k? (Manual, semi-auto, pod, something else?) Any specific models people recommend in this price range?

	3.	Would other options (moka pot + milk steamer, AeroPress recipes, good milk frother, or a good grinder upgrade) get me closer to espresso-like milk coffee without a full machine?

	4.	Anything I should be aware of when switching from French press to espresso-based milk drinks (grind settings, dose, milk temp/texturing, cleaning)?

**$DKNG**: **+100**

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1U

League: Philadephia Eagles vs Washington Commanders (4PM CST on FOX)

**Recap**: Jake Paul finally gets TKO. I'm sure people been waiting years for this to happen. It was a bad matchup. I mean the dude was boxing against a 2x heavyweight champ and he was originally scheduled to fight Gervonta Davis who is a 135er (I still think Tank would have beat him too). There's a weight class for a reason. But Jake Paul held his end and lasted as long as he could! He knew he was overmatched against AJ, but I knew he had a chin and he has never been finished. I'm glad I went 2.5U on this wager because that puts me up +29U! And this next one should put us up +30U for the year!

**Matchup:** I'm doing a SGP (Same-Game-Parlay) for this POTD. Sorry for to all the straight bettors and I kno I have been preaching how much parlays are a way for books to take advantage of you, but it can be profitable if you kno what you're doing. Always look at the risk-reward ratio (I wish I can show you a risk-reward matrix chart) If you have any doubts on any legs of a SGP or parlay, shave the leg off! Really, any high risk/reward, it's best to not include it in your lay! Also vice versa, lower the risk lower the reward (**you don't want to wager something like AJ Brown 1 Reception for like -4300 odds, just a stupid high risk for measly crummy profits**), gotta find a middleground! Something you think that it's attainable and I strongly believe these 3-legs of this SGP are attainable.

1.  Leg 1: **Commanders TT O 10.5** \- Yes, I am very aware this is a meaningless game for the Commanders, but teams still love to compete and spoil the party. This is a very meaningful game for the Eagles, but what I love about this prop is that Commanders QB knos the Eagles system. Marcus Mariota was a backup QB not too long ago for the bird gang and he has actually played well for them, serving as their backup couple years ago. Mariota is also a veteran and has actually played well this season as a starter. 10 Passing TDs in 7 games and nearly put the Broncos to the brink of defeat. 11.5 Points is the same price as 10.5 but you be surprise if Commanders go for 2 after a TD and hit a FG to get 11, so there you have, 11+ Points. Mariota should be able to put up points against this sus defense.
2. Leg 2: **Commanders +10.5** \- This isn't just a random number, it's precisely the number I like the Commanders to have just in case if the Eagles goes apeshit on their defense, but seriously I think this will be a close game and prolly will not need it, but it's best to be safe than sorry! So I always like to have the plus double digit points in my back pocket! But here are some stats, Mariota as a starter has covered the spread in his last 3 games. And wit the exception of their last game against the lowly Raiders, they been awful. They loss 3 consecutive games prior to last week and their defense allowed 22 or more points to their opponents. (prolly should have stated that on leg-1). I mentioned this in all my Eagles POTDs and writeups this year and previous years that the Eagles love to milk the clock, this team doesn't care about beating the shit outta you, they just want to do just enough to win. So if they are winning by 1 point and they have the possesion, they are going push tush for 1st down until the time expires. This team loves to coast toward the finish line.
3. Leg 3: **Eagles +4.5** \- I should prolly do ML, but again it's good to have an extra cushion in your back pocket if the Eagles somehow botch it and lose. Of course hopefully they just lose by less than 5 points which I think if they do end up losing it would be by a last second FG and Commanders win by 1 to 4 points (hopefully) But I just think they just win this game outright. They want to win the division sooner rather than later, so it's important to get it done as soon as they can. They don't want to give their rivals Cowboys any hope for the postseason, they want to narrow that window down starting wit this game.



**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on this SGP. Eagles win 14-13

1prc1zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1prc1zf/rp_please_help/,RP: please help,"My phone buzzed with a video from my daughter. I watched it, sitting on the edge of the bathtub, and saw my husband of twenty-three years pecking a beautiful blonde woman who has a face twenty years younger than mine, in a stadium VIP box. They looked happy. Radiantly, completely happy.
The bathroom light was brutal. I stood there in my silk pajamas, staring at a woman I barely recognized anymore. Fifty-two years old, and every single one of them was carved into my face. I looked tired. Soul-deep exhausted. The kind that sleep couldn't fix.
I watched it on loop until the pixels felt like shrapnel, then tiptoed past the guest room where our seventeen-year-old dreams of college baseball and still believed his father was too “busy” to come back home. In the bathroom mirror my reflection refused to blur; every wrinkle he'd stopped pecking stared back like a verdict. 
I open the Cartier box I found hidden in his suitcase, snap a photo of the bracelet that was never meant for my wrist, and post it to an anonymous Instagram story captioned: Evidence. 
My whole existence had become about maintaining other people's dreams while I withered away. I was married to a stranger who tolerated me instead of loved me.
———————
The bathroom light was brutal at three in the morning. I stood there in my silk pajamas, staring at a woman I barely recognized anymore. The mirror didn't lie, even when I desperately wanted it to. Fifty-two years old, and every single one of them was carved into my face.
God, I looked tired. Not just sleepy tired, but soul-deep exhausted. The kind that sleep couldn't fix because it wasn't really about sleep. These crow's feet weren't laugh lines. They were worry lines, disappointment lines, lines from squinting at a life that had somehow gone out of focus.
I touched the deep crease between my eyebrows. Permanent now. My face had gotten stuck in worry mode, and I couldn't remember how to smooth it out.
The expensive night cream sat on the counter, mocking me. Two hundred dollars for this tiny jar of lies. The saleswoman at Nordstrom had promised it would take ten years off my face. What a joke. I still looked exactly like what I was, a woman whose husband couldn't be bothered to really see her anymore.
Behind me, Brett slept like a man without a care in the world. His breathing was deep and even, his face completely relaxed. I envied that peace. I couldn't remember the last time I'd slept through the night without jerking awake at some ungodly hour, my mind spinning with thoughts I couldn't turn off.
The house was silent. Even our fourteen-thousand-square-foot mansion felt suffocating when insomnia hit. All those rooms, all that space, and nowhere to hide from my own restless mind.
I slipped back into bed, moving quietly so I wouldn't disturb Brett. He had that big meeting in the morning. European expansion or some mess. Another deal that would take him further away from this house, from this family, from me.
Three more hours until his alarm went off, and lying there, counting all the ways my life had shrunk without me noticing.
By six-thirty, I was already dressed and downstairs, the coffee maker gurgling to life. Brett stumbled into the kitchen in his charcoal Armani suit, his hair sticking up on one side. For just a second, he looked like the guy I'd fallen in love with twenty-three years ago. Then he grabbed his phone, and the spell broke.
""Coffee's ready,"" I said, filling his travel mug. Dark roast, splash of cream, two sugars. Same way he'd liked it since college.
""Thanks."" He scrolled through his emails while I stirred in the cream. His face was already tense with whatever crisis needed his attention.
""Devin has a game tonight,"" I said, handing him the mug. ""Seven o'clock. Big one against Everleigh Prep.""
""Mm-hmm."" He didn't look up from his screen. ""Baseball. Right.""
""He's been working on his swing all week. Coach thinks some scouts might show up."" I waited for him to react, to show some sign that he gave a freaking about his son's dreams.
He pocketed his phone and reached for his briefcase. ""That's great, hon. Really great.""
His response sounded like he was reading from a script. Supportive Husband and Father, Act One, Scene One.
""So you'll be there?"" I asked even though we both knew the answer.
""I'll try. You know how these investor meetings go. Could run really late."" He was already moving toward the garage, already halfway out the door in his mind.
""Right. Of course."" I forced a smile. ""The meeting's more important.""
""It's not more important,"" he said, but his hand was already on the door handle. ""It's just complicated timing.""
""It's always complicated timing, Brett.""
He stopped, turned back to me with that patient expression he wore when he thought I was being unreasonable. ""Lauren, you know how crucial this European deal is. We're talking about expanding into six new markets.""
""And you know how crucial tonight is for your son. But okay.""
""Don't be like that."" He sighed like I was a problem he needed to solve. ""I'll text you about dinner.""
He returns to peck my cheek in that automatic way married people do. Like checking off a box on a list. Then he was gone, the garage door rumbling open and closed.
My phone chimed against the granite counter. Robin's name lit up the screen.
SOS coffee date tomorrow? Amy's losing her mess about Richard again and I can't deal with her meltdowns alone.
I typed back quickly. God yes. I need alcohol but will settle for caffeine.
10 AM at Marie's Roast by the bookstore? The one with the comfy chairs where we can properly trash our husbands.
Perfect. I'll bring tissues and judgment.
You're the best. Also wine. I'm bringing wine in a coffee cup.
Before I could respond, another text popped up. Kimberly this time, and my heart did that little flutter it always did when I saw her name.
Morning beautiful mother of mine. Random check-in: how are you really doing? Not the automatic ""fine"" you always give everyone.
I stared at the screen. My twenty-one-year-old daughter was checking on me from her dorm room, probably cramming for some impossible organic chemistry exam, and she was worried about me. The irony was almost funny.
I'm good, sweetheart. Just the usual suburban wife chaos. How's school?
Three dots appeared, disappeared, appeared again.
That's not what I asked. I'm calling you tonight after Devin's game. And don't try to deflect with questions about my classes.
Honey, you don't need to worry about your old mom. Focus on your studies.
Too late. Already worried. Also, you're not old, you're just stuck. There's a difference.
My throat constricted. Sometimes Kimberly saw me clearer than I saw myself.
Love you, baby girl.
Love you too. We're talking tonight. For real.
I set the phone down and stared out the kitchen window at our backyard. Even the landscaping looked like it had been ordered from a catalog. Nothing out of place, nothing wild or unexpected. Just like my life.
The clock on the microwave read 8:15. I had just enough time to transform myself into the version of Lauren that other people expected to see. Hair, makeup, the right outfit. The whole performance.
I walked into the Westbrook Country Club meeting room where the usual suspects were already gathered around the oval table, coffee cups and pastries arranged just so. Twelve women who'd perfected the art of looking busy while accomplishing nothing meaningful.
""Lauren, darling, you look fabulous,"" Margaret Whitfield said, though she was already scanning the room for someone more important to talk to. Margaret's husband owned half the commercial real estate in Everleigh and Bexley Hills, which meant she thought she owned the other half. ""That jacket is stunning on you.""
""Thanks, Margaret."" I took my usual seat between Renee Henley and Diane Murray.
Renee gave me her smile. Diane was staring into her coffee cup like it might reveal the secrets of the universe.
""How's Brett?"" Renee asked, because that's what we did here. We asked about husbands like they were the most interesting thing about us.
""Busy as always. Big meeting about European expansion."" I heard myself reciting the same script I always did. Successful Husband, Important Work, Everything's Wonderful.
""Oh, how exciting,"" Renee said with the enthusiasm of someone discussing root canal surgery. ""Richard's been traveling so much lately. I barely see him.""
Diane finally looked up from her coffee. ""At least you know where Richard is when he travels.""
Her comment hung there like a toxic cloud. We all knew about Diane's husband and his twenty-five-year-old assistant. We just pretended we didn't because that's what polite society did. We looked the other way and changed the subject and let each other slowly die inside.
""Well,"" Margaret said brightly, clearly uncomfortable with any hint of real emotion, ""shall we dive into the final details for the literacy fundraiser?""
For the next hour and fifteen minutes, we debated napkin colors with the intensity of a Supreme Court hearing. Ivory versus cream. Cotton versus linen. Round tables versus rectangular. It was like being trapped in inferno, if inferno was decorated by someone with excellent taste and no sense of proportion.
""I really feel the ivory complements the floral arrangements better,"" Margaret said, holding up two fabric samples that looked identical to my untrained eye. ""More sophisticated, don't you think?""
""But cream is more classic,"" Renee argued, leaning forward like she was making a point about nuclear disarmament. ""More timeless.""
I watched these women I'd been sitting with for six years debate napkins like the fate of Western civilization was at stake. We were supposed to be raising money for kids who didn't have books to read, and we'd spent over an hour on table linens.
""Lauren, you've been quiet,"" Margaret said, turning to me with that bright smile that never reached her eyes. ""What's your opinion? You have such wonderful taste.""
Translation: You haven't contributed anything meaningful to this ridiculous conversation, and we need to pretend your opinion matters so you'll keep showing up and writing checks.
""Both are lovely,"" I said, because that's what was expected. ""I'm sure whatever we choose will be beautiful.""
Margaret beamed like I'd just solved world hunger. ""See? I knew Lauren would have the right perspective.""
I looked around the table at these women whose lives paralleled mine in all the worst ways. Diane, pretending her husband wasn't cheating. Susan, so loaded on Xanax she could barely keep her eyes focused. Claire, who'd had so much plastic surgery she looked permanently surprised.
We were all slowly suffocating in our ideal lives, and nobody was brave enough to say it out loud.
The meeting finally ended at eleven-forty-five. I escaped to my car and sat in the parking lot for a few minutes, letting myself breathe real air instead of the recycled misery we'd been sharing for the past two hours.
Devin's baseball game was exactly what my soul needed. Real stakes, real emotion, real people caring about something that actually mattered. I climbed the bleachers and found Carol Reynolds waving me over.
""Lauren, thank God you're here,"" Carol said as I settled next to her. ""I need someone sane to sit with. Jake's dad has been yelling at the umpire since warm-ups.""
""How's Devin looking?"" I asked, scanning the field until I found my son taking practice swings.
""Focused. Determined. Scary focused, actually."" Carol laughed. ""Jake says he's been living at the batting cages.""
""Pretty much. I barely see him except when he's inhaling food between practices.""
""It's paying off. Jake mentioned some college scouts have been asking questions.""
My heart picked up speed. ""Really? Which schools?""
""UConn for sure. Maybe Boston College. You know how these kids exaggerate, but Jake seemed pretty sure about UConn.""
I watched Devin adjust his batting gloves, his whole body coiled with concentration. This was what passion looked like, and what it meant to want something so badly you'd sacrifice everything else for it. I couldn't remember the last time I'd felt that kind of hunger for anything.
The game started with Everleigh High school scoring two quick runs in the first inning. Their pitcher was throwing heat, and our boys looked rattled. By the sixth inning, we were down 4-2, and the crowd was getting restless.
""Come on, baby,"" I whispered as Devin stepped into the batter's box with two outs and runners on second and third. Everything came down to this moment. All those hours of practice, and dreams of playing in college.
The pitcher wound up, delivered. High and tight. Devin stepped back, reset himself.
The second pitch was right down the middle. Devin's bat connected with a crack that reverberated across the field, and the ball kept climbing, sailing over the left fielder's head and into the trees beyond the fence.
Home run. Three runs scored. We were ahead 5-4.
I jumped up with everyone else, screaming until my throat hurt. Devin rounded the bases with the biggest grin I'd seen from him all year, and when he crossed home plate, his teammates mobbed him. But through all the chaos, he found me in the stands and pointed right at me.
""That was for you, Mom,"" he mouthed, and my eyes filled with tears.
This beautiful, determined, hardworking kid was mine. Somehow, despite all the ways I'd failed at everything else, I'd helped create this person who knew how to fight for his dreams.
After the game, Devin jogged over to the fence where parents were waiting. His face was flushed with victory and pure joy.
""Mom, did you see that? Did you see that hit?"" He caught himself immediately. ""Sorry. Did you see that hit?""
I laughed. ""I saw it, and it was incredible.""
His eyes went wide. ""Mom!""
""What? You hit a home run when it mattered most. That deserves some strong language.""
""Coach Phelps wants to talk to me about the UConn scout. He wants to meet with me next week."" Devin's tone cracked slightly, caught between excitement and disbelief.
""That's amazing, baby. I'm so proud of you.""
His smile faltered as he scanned the crowd of parents behind me. ""Is Dad here somewhere?""
My heart sank. ""He had that investor meeting. You know how those go.""
""Right."" Devin's face went neutral, the expression kids master when they're tired of being disappointed by the adults who are supposed to love them most. ""No big deal. I figured.""
But it was a big deal. It was the biggest deal in the world, and we both knew it.
""Listen, Mom, the team wants to go to Jake's house to celebrate. His parents said it was cool if we all sleep over. Can I go?""
""Of course. Just text me when you get there safely.""
""Thanks. Love you, Mom. Thanks for coming. It means everything.""
""Love you too, superstar.""
I watched him run back to his teammates, already moving past his father's absence because that's what resilient kids learn to do. They adapt. They lower their expectations. They protect their hearts the only way they know how.
I drove home through streets lined with pristine houses and well maintained lawns, everything looking exactly like it was supposed to look from the outside. Just like my marriage.
I walked through the front door of our house. I'd left some lights on, but it still felt empty. Cold. I stood in the foyer for a moment, listening to nothing but the sound of my heartbeat.
My phone chimed. Brett, right on schedule.
Meeting running very late. Don't wait up.
Six words. Twenty-three years of marriage, and this is what we'd become. Six words and no curiosity about his son's moment of triumph.
I typed back: Devin won the game with a home run. UConn scout wants to meet with him.
The three dots appeared and disappeared twice before his response came through.
That's fantastic. Tell him I'm proud.
I made myself a turkey sandwich and ate it standing at the kitchen island, scrolling through Facebook on my phone. Beach vacations and anniversary dinners and family game nights. Everyone looked so happy in their curated snapshots of perfection.
After eating, I wandered upstairs to Devin's room. It was a disaster zone, as usual, but it was also bursting with life. Baseball trophies covered every surface. Photos plastered his bulletin board, team pictures, shots with friends, a few with girls I pretended not to notice. This room had energy. It had dreams taking shape and growing stronger every day.
I picked up his newest trophy from last month's regional championship. ""Most Valuable Player"" was engraved on the brass plate. The heft of it felt solid and earned in my hands. He'd worked for this. Fought for it. Deserved every moment of recognition.
I sat on his unmade bed, still holding the trophy, trying to remember the last time I'd felt proud of something I'd accomplished. The last time I'd worked toward something that mattered to me.
Nothing came to mind. Not one freaking thing.
The realization settled in my core like a stone. I had nothing to build toward. Nothing to fight for. Nothing that belonged to me alone. My whole existence had become about maintaining other people's dreams while mine withered away in some forgotten corner of my soul.
My phone chimed. Devin again.
Made it to Jake's. Thanks for being there tonight, Mom. You're literally the best person in the world.
I smiled despite the ache in my ribcage. At least I was succeeding at something.
I headed back downstairs, too restless for bed but not sure what to do with myself. Brett's study was dark. The living room felt too formal for one person. The family room was designed for gatherings that never happened anymore.
I ended up in the basement storage room, looking for something to organize. Something to make me feel useful instead of ornamental. I found several boxes labeled ""Lauren's Things"" in my own handwriting from years ago. I couldn't even remember what I'd thought was worth saving.
The first box held college textbooks and notebooks filled with essays about books that had once changed how I saw the world. Philosophy and literature and creative writing courses. I'd been an English major with big dreams about writing novels that would make people feel less alone.
The second box contained photo albums from before everything went digital. Pictures of Brett and me when we were young and stupid in love, when touching each other felt like a revelation instead of an obligation. Pictures of baby Kimberly and toddler Devin, back when they thought I had all the answers.
The third box was smaller, more personal. My college diploma. Jewelry from my grandmother who'd died believing I would do something important with my life. And at the bottom, wrapped in tissue paper, a leather journal with a broken clasp.
I opened it with shaking hands. The pages had yellowed, but my handwriting was still clear. Twenty-seven-year-old Lauren, full of plans and hunger and absolute certainty that life was going to be extraordinary.
March 15th - Started a new story today about a woman who quits her safe job and backpacks through Europe alone. I've never been anywhere, but I dream about it constantly. Sidewalk cafes in Paris where you can sit for hours people-watching. Museums in Florence where you stand in front of paintings until they tell you their secrets. Greek islands where the water is so impossibly blue it looks fake.
April 2nd - Brett thinks I should put writing on the back burner until we're more settled. Kids, mortgage, all that grown-up stuff. He says there will be plenty of time for my ""hobbies"" later.
May 20th - He proposed! I can't stop staring at this ring. We're going to build the most amazing life together. Everything feels possible when you love someone this much. I can have the writing and the marriage and the family. I can have it all.
July 8th - Wedding planning is sucking my soul dry. Everyone has opinions about flowers and music and where people should sit. Brett says it doesn't matter as long as we end up married, but it feels like it matters in ways I can't explain. Like I'm disappearing into what everyone else thinks our wedding should be.
I flipped through page after page of dreams I'd completely forgotten existed. Travel plans and book ideas and career goals. A woman who believed she was the star of her own story, not a supporting character in everyone else's.
That woman felt like a stranger now. A naive girl who thought she could have everything without sacrificing anything.
I closed the journal and held it against my ribs, sitting on the concrete floor surrounded by boxes of a life I'd packed away and forgotten about.
Upstairs, the house was silent and empty. Brett would come home late tonight. Devin was making memories with his friends. Kimberly was building her future two hours away.
And I was here, alone with proof of dreams I'd abandoned so gradually I hadn't even noticed they were gone.
The woman who'd written in this journal wouldn't recognize who I'd become. She wouldn't understand how someone could live in a mansion and feel homeless, or could be surrounded by family and feel invisible.
But maybe she was still in here somewhere. Buried under years of saying yes when I meant no, of making myself smaller when I wanted to grow, of settling for fine when I'd once demanded magical.
I tucked the journal under my arm and headed back upstairs.
With each page I turned, memories returned. Dreams I once dared to chase. Last night, it stirred something deep inside me. This morning, I craved more, coffee warming my hands, time pausing just long enough to remember who I used to be.
June 12th. Bought a photography book today. Black and white portraits that make you feel like you know these strangers' entire life stories. I want to learn how to see people that way, capture something true about who they really are underneath all the masks we wear.
August 3rd. Brett thinks photography is an expensive hobby we can't afford right now. Maybe he's right. But God, I want to travel and take pictures and write about the places that change you just by being there. I want to document real life, not the sanitized version we're all pretending to live.
My younger self had been so hungry for everything. Adventure, creativity, meaning. She'd wanted to capture truth with a camera and tell stories that mattered. I traced my finger over the faded ink, remembering that electric feeling of wanting something so badly it ached. That version of me would have saved up for months to buy a decent camera. She would have researched travel writing programs and photography workshops. She would have figured out a way to make it happen, even if it meant eating ramen for weeks.
Now I couldn't even remember the last time I'd wanted anything specific enough to fight for it.
Brett's footsteps creaked overhead, shuffling around the bedroom in that lazy Saturday morning way. Still in bed at seven fifteen, which meant he'd probably stay there until the last possible second before his golf game. I knew his schedule better than he did sometimes. Golf at nine with Tom, Marcus, and Steve. Same three guys he'd been playing with for twelve years. Lunch at the club after, where they'd discuss business deals and complain about their wives. Home by three if I was lucky, four if they decided to have a few beers and relive their glory days.
Last night he'd crept in around midnight, shower running until almost twelve thirty like he was washing off the day. I'd pretended to be asleep as he slipped into bed, his body positioned on his side of the mattress like there was an invisible wall between us. No goodnight peck, no mention of Devin's game, and no acknowledgment that I was even there. Just the sound of his breathing settling into sleep while I shut my eyes tight and counted all the ways we'd become strangers.
I closed the journal and started making breakfast, letting myself imagine just for a minute that things could be different. That Brett might come downstairs and see me this morning. Really see me, not just glance over while his mind was already somewhere else. That we could talk like we used to, back when we told each other everything, and staying in bed on Saturday mornings felt like the most natural thing in the world.
The fantasy felt pathetic even as I indulged in it, but I couldn't stop myself. Some stupid part of me still hoped. Still believed that the right breakfast or the right conversation could bridge this canyon between us.
You're pathetic, Lauren, I thought, cracking eggs into a bowl. Fifty two years old and still believing in fairy tales.
I scrambled eggs how he liked them, with just a touch of cream cheese folded in at the end. Made fresh orange juice instead of opening the carton. Put together a fruit salad with berries and melon cut into precise pieces. The breakfast I used to make when we were trying to impress each other instead of just existing in the same space.
This was me trying. Me making an effort to create something beautiful between us, even though every attempt over the past few years had been met with distraction or polite indifference. I arranged everything on the island like a magazine photo shoot, complete with cloth napkins instead of paper ones.
Maybe today would be different, and I could find a way to reach him.
Brett appeared in the kitchen at eight forty five wearing his golf clothes, hair still damp from the shower. Blue polo, khakis, that cologne he'd been wearing since college. He looked good in that effortless way men in their fifties sometimes managed when they had money and time to take care of themselves. Still handsome, still the guy who'd made my heart skip as he walked into my American Literature class twenty four years ago. Still capable of making me feel like an awkward college girl when he smiled a certain way.
Too bad he hardly ever smiled that way anymore.
""Morning,"" he said, reaching for his coffee mug like it was any other day. No comment on the breakfast I'd laid out. No acknowledgment that I'd gone to any trouble. Just another Saturday morning in the life of Brett Holmes.
My ribs ached. Of course. What did you expect?
""I made breakfast,"" I said, gesturing toward the spread I'd arranged on the island. ""Thought we could sit down together for once.""
He glanced at his watch, that quick flick of his wrist that told me everything I needed to know about his priorities. My heart sank before he even spoke.
""I've got to be at the club by nine ten,"" he said, already reaching for a piece of toast. ""Rain check?""
How many rain checks have we had? How many times have I done this exact dance?
""It's eight forty five. The club is ten minutes away."" I said, like his answer didn't matter even though it did. Like I hadn't gotten up early and spent thirty minutes making his favorite breakfast just so we could have fifteen minutes of actual conversation. ""Come on, when was the last time we had a real breakfast together?""
Brett paused, fork halfway to his mouth, and for a second I saw something flicker across his face. Guilt maybe, or recognition that I was right. We hadn't eaten a meal together without the TV on or our phones out in months.
His shoulders dropped slightly. ""Fine,"" he said, settling onto the barstool across from me with a barely audible sigh. ""Yeah. Sure.""
Don't sigh like I'm a burden, I wanted to scream. Don't act like spending ten minutes with your wife is such a hardship.
He sat across from me at the island, and for a moment it almost felt normal. Like we were still people who chose to spend time together instead of people who just happened to live in the same house. I cut into my eggs and watched him take his first bite, hoping he'd notice the cream cheese and remember that I still paid attention to the little things he liked.
""Devin's game was amazing last night,"" I said, trying to inject enthusiasm into my tone. ""He hit this incredible home run in the bottom of the seventh. You should have seen his face as he rounded third base. Pure joy.""
""That's great,"" Brett said, taking another bite of eggs. His phone was already in his other hand, thumb scrolling across the screen.
And there it is. The sting of competing with a device for my husband's attention.
""The whole crowd went wild. I mean, everyone was on their feet screaming."" I was talking faster now, trying to hold his attention before it drifted away. ""Mrs. Patterson from down the street was crying happy tears. It was one of those sports moments you see in movies.""
""Mm hmm,"" he murmured, his attention absorbed by whatever was happening on that screen. Probably emails from work, or stock prices, or golf scores from yesterday's round.
My jaw tensed. Look at me. Just look at me.
""The UConn scout wants to meet with him next week,"" I continued, getting a little firmer. ""Can you believe that? Our baby might get a scholarship to play Division One baseball.""
""Mm hmm. That's fantastic.""
Fantastic. He said it like he'd say ""pass the salt.""
I reached across the table and gently pushed his phone down, my fingers brushing his knuckles. His skin was warm, and for a split second, I remembered what it used to feel like when touching him was natural instead of calculated.
""Brett,"" I said quietly, my voice cracking slightly. ""I'm trying to talk to you.""
He looked up with that expression I'd started to hate, like I was interrupting something infinitely more important than our conversation. Like I was being unreasonable for expecting his attention during breakfast.
""I'm listening,"" he said, his tone clipped. ""UConn scout. That's fantastic.""
No, you're not listening. You're tolerating.
""Are you?"" I asked, my voice small. ""Because it feels like you're somewhere else entirely. Like your body is here but your brain is in your phone or at the office or anywhere but with me.""
His expression shifted to one of mild irritation. ""I'm right here, Lauren. I said it was fantastic. What more do you want?""
What more do I want? As if he couldn't understand what I was asking for. As if basic human connection was too much to expect.
""When was the last time we really talked?"" I asked, setting down my fork with emphasis. ""I mean talked, not just logistics about schedules and who's picking up dry cleaning and whether we need milk from the store.""
Brett set down his fork and looked at me like I'd just suggested we sell everything and move to a commune. ""We talk all the time,"" he said slowly, as if speaking to a child.
""No, we don't."" My voice was rising despite my efforts to stay calm. ""We exchange information. We coordinate calendars. We exist in parallel instead of together, and I feel like I'm disappearing.""
I didn't mean for it to sound so desperate, but there it was, the truth I'd been trying to package in prettier wrapping for months.
""Lauren."" He said my name like it was a sigh, like I was exhausting him just by existing. ""What is this about?""
What is this about? I stared at him, this man I'd shared a bed with for over two decades, and felt like I was looking at a stranger.
""It's about us,"" I said, my voice breaking. ""About the fact that we're strangers living in the same house. About how you missed your son's biggest game of the year because of work, and you didn't even ask me about it until I brought it up.""
Brett's face darkened. He pushed back from the island slightly, like he needed space from this conversation. ""I've been working my hip off to provide for this family,"" he said, his voice getting louder, more defensive. ""The European expansion is huge for the company, for our future. We're talking about six new markets, Lauren. Six. Do you have any idea what that means for our bottom line?""
Our bottom line. Not our family. Not our happiness. Our bottom line.
""I'm not asking you to stop working hard,"" I said, trying to keep my voice level even though I could feel my heart racing. ""I'm asking you to be here. With us. With me. I'm asking you to care about the things that happen in your own house.""
Brett rubbed his forehead like I was giving him a migraine. The gesture was so dismissive, so tired, that I wanted to throw something.
""What exactly do you want from me, Lauren?"" he asked, his voice flat. ""I work hard, I provide for our family, I don't cheat or drink or gamble away our savings. I'm home every night. What more is there?""
What more is there?
""I want you to want to be here,"" I said, my voice cracking despite my best efforts to stay composed. Tears were threatening now, hot and shameful. ""I want you to notice when I'm struggling or excited or sad. I want to feel like I matter to you as more than just the person who keeps your life organized and your house clean.""
Brett stood up abruptly, carrying his plate to the sink with sharp, dismissive movements. ""You're being dramatic,"" he said over his shoulder, like he was closing the conversation along with his breakfast. ""Everything's fine, Lauren. You're looking for problems where there aren't any.""
Dramatic. Like a blow.
""Everything is not fine."" My voice broke now, and I didn't care anymore. ""I'm not fine. We're not fine. I feel like I'm married to a stranger who tolerates me instead of loves me.""
""Speak for yourself,"" Brett said coldly, grabbing his golf bag from the closet. He slung it over his shoulder with quick, angry movements. ""I've got to go. We'll talk about this later.""
""When?"" I called after him, my voice getting desperate now, cracking like a teenager's. ""When will we talk about it? Because later never seems to come, Brett. It's always golf or work or some meeting or conference call. There's always something more important than dealing with what's happening between us.""
But he was already walking toward the garage, already gone even though he was still in the room. The door closed behind him with a decisive click that felt final, like the sound of opportunity slipping away.
I sat there for a long time, staring at his barely touched eggs and feeling stupid for trying. For hoping. For thinking that one conversation over scrambled eggs could bridge the canyon that had opened up between us without either of us noticing. The fruit salad looked ridiculous now, all those pieces arranged like I was expecting company instead of just trying to connect with my own husband.
Twenty four years together, and this is what we'd become. Two people who shared a mortgage and a last name but couldn't have a real conversation over breakfast.
My phone vibrated against the counter, making me jump. A text from Devin.
Hey Mom, heading home from Jake's. Thanks again for coming last night. Still can't believe I hit that homer. Feel like I'm dreaming.
I smiled despite the ache in my ribs. At least someone in this family still knew how to love out loud.
So proud of you, baby. Can't wait to hear all about it.
Love you. See you in a bit.
I cleaned up the breakfast mess, wrapping up the leftover fruit and putting Brett's untouched orange juice in the fridge. All that effort for a ten minute conversation that went nowhere. All that hope for nothing. The scrambled eggs went into the garbage disposal with a satisfying grinding sound.
Twenty minutes later, Devin burst through the front door like a hurricane, still buzzing with energy from his victory and his sleepover. His hair was sticking up in every direction, and he was wearing clothes that definitely weren't the ones he'd left in last night, probably borrowed from Jake, who was three inches taller and twenty pounds heavier.
""Mom, you should have seen Jake's face when Coach called about the scout meeting,"" he said, dropping his duffel bag in the middle of the hallway like he'd been doing since he was five years old. ""He was so jealous, but in a good way. Like he was happy for me but also wanted to kill me.""
The energy radiating from him was infectious. This morning, I felt myself smile for real.
""That's what good friends do,"" I said, pulling him into a hug that he returned instead of tolerating. His body was solid and strong, smelling like teenage boy and grass stains and victory. ""They celebrate your wins even when they're jealous.""
""I keep thinking I'm going to wake up and it'll all be a dream,"" Devin said, his voice cracking slightly with excitement. ""UConn, Mom. The University of Connecticut Huskies want to talk to Devin Holmes from boring old Bexley Hills.""
""It's not a dream, and you're not boring,"" I said, pulling back to look at his face. His eyes were bright with possibility, with hope I hadn't felt in years. ""You earned this, sweetheart.""
Devin's eyes swept the kitchen, searching. The hope in his expression dimmed slightly.
""Where's Dad?"" he asked. ""I figured he'd want to hear about the scout thing. I mean, this is pretty huge, right?""
My heart ached. Of course he'd want to share this with his father. He had assume Brett would be here, waiting to hear every detail about the most important thing that had ever happened to him.
""He had to leave for golf,"" I lied again. Making excuses again. ""But he's excited for you. Really excited.""
""Right,"" Devin said, his face going neutral in that way teenagers had mastered to avoid showing they were hurt. ""Golf. With the guys.""
The resignation in his voice broke something inside me.
""He really is proud of you, Dev,"" I said, hating myself for making excuses for Brett again. ""He just shows it differently than I do.""
""Sure,"" he said, grabbing an apple from the fruit bowl and taking a huge bite. Juice ran down his chin, and he wiped it with the back of his hand. ""It's fine, Mom. I'm used to it.""
That was the problem. He was used to it.
My seventeen year old son had already learned to expect disappointment from his father. He'd already developed the emotional armor kids needed when the adults in their lives let them down consistently. Brett was missing everything that mattered, and Devin had stopped expecting anything different.
""Listen, I've got to shower and then meet the guys for pickup basketball at the rec center,"" Devin said, already heading toward the stairs. ""But can we talk later about the UConn meeting? Like, what I should say and stuff? I have no idea how these things work.""
""Of course,"" I said, truly intending it. ""We'll figure it out together.""
""Thanks, Mom. You're seriously the best."" He paused on the bottom step and looked back at me, his expression suddenly serious. ""I don't know what I'd do without you.""
He bounded upstairs two steps at a time, leaving me alone with my coffee and the wreckage of my failed attempt at connection with Brett. I finished cleaning up the breakfast dishes and wiped down counters that were already spotless, just to have something to do with my hands.
By nine forty five, I was ready to escape to Marie's Roast and the company of women who understood what it felt like to be slowly suffocating in lives that looked ideal from the outside.
The coffee shop was busy with the Saturday morning crowd. Families with kids and couples reading the paper together and groups of friends catching up over lattes. All these people who seemed to enjoy each other's company.
I spotted Robin and Amy at our usual table in the back corner, the one surrounded by bookshelves and mismatched chairs that made it easy to settle in for long conversations.

Random people talk to you. At the servo. At the beach. In the lift. Waiting for coffee. It is never deep but it is constant. A comment about the weather. A joke about the line taking forever. A quick chat that ends with no names exchanged and everyone moving on.

Back home this would feel strange or forced. Here it feels normal. Sometimes even expected. I have had full conversations with people I will never see again and somehow it does not feel awkward. It feels easy.

What I cannot figure out is whether this is just politeness or if Australians actually enjoy these small interactions. Is it about being friendly or just filling the silence. Do people genuinely care or is it more of a social reflex.

I also notice that it does not usually turn into anything more. You laugh. You nod. You go on with your day. No pressure. No follow up.

Is this something you grow up learning here or is it just part of the culture without anyone really thinking about it. And do Australians notice when someone does not play along with it?",265,1766229256.0,AskAnAustralian,179,0.96,False

Do you fear deep water? I do. Of all the phobias which exist, I imagine this one is among the most common a lot of us share. I invite you to imagine just how it felt for me in that moment. Picture yourself in a deep, yet relatively safe body of water. Maybe a diving pool. You look down, your legs are dangling above the bottom, 16 feet below.

Not scared yet? Okay… now imagine the complex is empty. It’s night time. You watch as the lights are all switched off one by one, and suddenly you are alone. All you can hear is the gentle swish of the water, and perhaps now there are subtle thoughts nagging at the back of your mind. Is the bottom still there? Which way is out? What’s underneath me?

Now, take away the swimming complex. You’re not there anymore. No. Now you’re floating in a lake. It’s not huge, you can see the shoreline, and it’s only around 20 feet deep. You know this lake well. You swim here often. Yet still, it is night time, there is no one else around you, and while the human part of your brain knows that there are no dangers in this lake, those primal fears that still dwell deep within your DNA makeup don’t know that. What was that splash of water behind you? A small wave? Or something moving? But no… you know this lake. You know that you are safe.

Now imagine you have no such comforts. You are kilometres off shore, floating in the rough seas of the South Pacific. There is over 13 thousand feet of dark water underneath you. It is the middle of the night. You are alone, and you know without a shred of doubt that there most certainly are many things swimming around underneath you. It is quite impossible to accurately describe the fear one feels in that situation. So like I said, I invite you to ***attempt*** to imagine it.

For the first few minutes on end I was practically hyperventilating. Rough waves were rising up, smacking me across the face, and I was struggling to tread water and keep myself afloat, such was my state of panic. I remember the pain in my neck as I snapped my head around every which way, frantically looking for any sign of hope, only to see an endless dark horizon in every direction. 

I recall the moment I managed to somewhat calm my panicked mind, the dizziness subsiding, and my breath returning to something that resembled normal. That, of course, was the moment the true fear set in. That fight or flight mode tends to keep you distracted enough that you don’t need to focus on the reality of the terrible situation you are in. It was when I calmed a little, began breathing steadily and treading water naturally, that it all hit me at once.

I felt so small. Quite literally a drop in the ocean. I tried so hard to stay focussed, but all I could think about as I flailed there in the ocean was how quick and easy it would be for a great white shark to swim by and sink its teeth into my abdomen. I wouldn’t even know it was coming. It was so dark, and the sounds of the wind and the waves would drown anything out. I would just be floating there whole one minute, then I would be a bleeding corpse the next. 

I thought about how pointless a death that would be. It’s strange, but these are the things you think about when you’re facing such a reality. Sharks don’t even like the taste of humans. I wouldn’t even become a satisfying meal for a hungry predator. I would just waste away out there, slowly disintegrating for nothing.

And then it happened. Shocking me out of my morbid thoughts as though only to confirm them, a slight tickle on the bottom of my foot. I snapped backwards quickly, though I did not look down, not wanting to be proven right. I continued treading water, hoping, praying that whatever had just touched me had been a stray piece of seaweed or something harmless like that. 

I thought about my legs helplessly dangling down there. I imagined a mouth opening up as a tiger shark raced up from the depths, ready to close its jaws around my feet. I shook my head vigorously in an attempt to rid those awful thoughts from my mind… 

And there it was again. But not just a tickle this time. No. I felt something grasp around my ankle. I quickly pushed myself backward in the water again, and took a few backstrokes away from where I was. What the hell was that?! Something had just grabbed me! No shark can do that.

I was quickly returning now to my panicked state, my primal brain screaming at me to get out of the water, but of course that not being an option. I told myself I had to keep calm, and did so the best I could. I forced myself to breathe to a rhythm, and I forced myself to keep treading water slowly, to not thrash about, to conserve energy. 

Yet, every few minutes or so, I would feel it again. That feeling of something slippery and slimy poking, grabbing and prodding at my feet and legs. For those arduous hours that I was out there in the blackness of the ocean, this thing’s behaviour continued. Every so often I would just start swimming. I don’t know how far I got, the tide was strong and I could feel currents pulling me back the way I came. 

No matter how far I thought I swam, however, this thing pursued me. At one point I felt the distinct sensation of some kind of tentacle wrapping around my thigh. I could feel it squeezing tighter, almost to the point that I could not kick that leg any further, and I almost resigned myself to drowning in that moment. I don’t know what it was, and I still don’t know why it let go. But that would be the last I felt of it.

Minutes later, after what I can only estimate was around 3 hours stranded in the middle of the ocean alone, I heard a sound that I never imagined could bring me such comfort.

***Bwooom! Bwooom!***

I looked around, and there it was, its bright spotlight shining straight on me. I was not ignorant to the fact that I was about to be going from the fire back into the frying pan, I was just grateful I was going to be out of the former. The ferry’s engined slowed to a crawl, as it began spinning around, turning to face the Portside of the ship toward me. 

Up on deck stood two pale figures. I must stress, these figures, while humanoid, were clearly not human beings. For one thing, they were naked, yet featureless. Their faces blank slates. I mean, they did have faces, they were just devoid of any emotion or intent. I did wonder for a moment what these things’ intentions were. Did they mean me harm? Were they here to finish me off? Were they here to simply taunt me as I continued flailing helplessly in the water until I inevitably drowned?

Thankfully, none of these theories were true, as a second later I watched them hurl a life ring out to me. The way they moved was bizarre. Every motion was in parallel unison with each other. Both arms swung out like a perfect mirror image as they threw the floatation device out to me. Then, after I grabbed on, they once again, in perfect unison, began reeling me in. 

Once I reached the side of the ferry, they continued their bizarre synchronised routine, reaching down and tossing over a rope ladder, which I proceeded to climb up, dragging myself onto the deck of the ferry. Exhausted, I lay there for a few moments, thankful to be out of the water, yet painfully aware I had only prolonged the misery of my foreseeable destiny. After a minute or so laying there and catching my breath, I rolled over, reached out for the railing and pulled myself back up to my feet. I stood up to face these… things. 

They stared at me, still standing side by side, an almost perfect reflection of eachother. The sole difference between them now, is that one did indeed have an expression on its face, and not a pleasant one. It stared at me with a frown. I didn’t feel like I was in any immediate danger from these things though. More than anything, he just looked mildly pissed off. I was just about to open my mouth and thank them, when out of nowhere, he slapped me!

Seriously! I shit you not! This… thing, without a single change in expression, with zero hesitation, raised its hand and slapped me across the face! I could only stare at this asshole, a look of absolute bewilderment on my face, as they both turned and walked away. Once again, they moved in perfect synch with one another. I watched them round the corner out to the rear deck, and that was the last I ever saw of them. Jesus… Just when I thought this ferry could get no weirder. I lifted a hand to my face, rubbing it slightly. My God that hurt!

I wouldn’t have too long to dwell on it though, as in that moment my eyes were drawn to an almighty crash from the ocean behind me. Water from whatever had been responsible for this disturbance splashed all over me, drenching the deck. I staggered back a little, as the ferry itself creaked and groaned, tipping to one side before crashing back down again. 

I rubbed the salty water from my eyes, my vision blurry, as I heard the ferry’s engines roaring back to life. We began to pick up pace now, as I stumbled my way over to the railing, leaning over and glancing out into the ocean. There was no mistaking it this time, there was something massive beneath those waves. It moved with purpose, its form swaggering from side to side as it drifted through the water. Whatever it was, it did not seem capable of immense speed. It quickly fell behind the more the ferry picked up pace, powering away into the night.

I thought of a couple of things in that moment. My first thought, of course, being the hours I had spent floating in those waters, with that thing poking and prodding at me. Had it been this giant taunting me all that time? And if so, why did it not pull me down into the depths with it? 

The second thought that crossed my mind were the ferry’s seemingly random trips out to sea. Could it be the case that whatever this thing was, was hunting us? Were these back and forths out into deeper waters not random at all, and simply the Captain trying to stay one step ahead of this monster? I did not know. 

All I knew in that moment was that I was glad I was not down there with it. Taking one last glance out to sea and noting the sun just beginning to peak its head over the distant horizon, I slid open the door to the cabin and stepped on back inside. It didn’t take long then for the physical exhaustion to catch up with me. Adrenaline had worn off, unable to keep my physical limitations from giving out any longer. My legs turned to jelly and I collapsed right there where I stood…

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I awoke a few hours later to a hand shaking me. Honestly, I was tempted to just ignore whatever the hell it was and continue sleeping. Perhaps forever, such was the stink of death on me at this point.

*“Sir… it’s almost closing time!”*

Café Guy’s voice was both a soothing presence and a harrowing reminder that I had once again awoken to another day of this nautical nightmare. I slowly sat up, stretching a little and rubbing my eyes before letting out a monstrous yawn. I noticed the ferry was idle once again, and I wondered where we might be. I was about to speak up in response when I was cut off by the obnoxiously loud P.A. system.

*“Attention passengers! We will be making our departure momentarily. The café service will close soon. A reminder to all, please remain inside the vessel and seated. If you need to stretch your legs or get some fresh air, please keep well away from the water. I repeat, no matter what you see, STAY AWAY FROM THE WATER!”*

Right… That was clearly directed at me, I thought. Apparently I had broken yet another weird rule. What the hell was I meant to do? There was a giant freaking cargo ship about to smash into us! Was I supposed to just stand there and die? Then again, that clearly had been some kind of hallucination. Or was it? I had physically felt it roar past above me when I was down there…

*“Sir… I must insist that we move things along.”*

I looked up, realising Café Guy was holding out a hand to me. I grabbed hold and he helped me up off the floor. My clothes were still all damp, and I stunk like a wet dog.

*“Ah… thanks mate.”* I said, as I struggled to find my footing, my body still very weak.

*“Come on… let’s fix you something to eat,”* Café Guy spoke warmly, smiling that trademark smile. He really did have something of a calming effect among all this madness. I followed him over to the café counter, and I was about to step up and place my order, when I heard a door from the floor below fly open and then slam back shut. I heard pounding footsteps coming up the internal stairwell, and I stumbled backwards in fear, falling back into one of the centre rows of seats.

***Boom…***

***Boom…***

***Boom…***

The heavy footfalls continued stomping up the stairs, until finally, a huge man entered the room, a pissed off look on his face.

Ramp Guy.

Honestly, I didn’t know whether to cower in fear or burst out laughing. What a pointlessly over the top entrance this had been. That was a bit of theme for him. He was a proper brute of a guy, throwing the ramp around the deck like it’s some sort of sentient being who had wronged him in some way. I stopped myself there, noticing my internal dialogue was causing a smirk to crawl across my face, not wanting to anger the bloke any further. He stomped his way up to Café Guy’s counter and slammed a fist down on top of it.

*“Sausage rolls. Two of ‘em. Now!”* Said Ramp Guy, staring Café Guy down with a look of sheer hatred.

Café Guy? He just stood there, totally unfazed by this.

*“No problem Sir! Coming right up!”* Said Café Guy, that outwardly positive attitude completely stumping the big fella who stood before him.

*“Right! You’re… you’re damn right it’s no problem!”* Ramp Guy spat back at him, as he turned and started pacing back and forth.

*“Wonderful day we’re having!”* Said Café Guy. *“I think I feel a spot of rain on the agenda today!”*

Ramp Guy wasn’t having any of this, his teeth beginning to bare as his face continued to distort into more and more of a scowl.

*“I asked for sausage rolls, not a damn weather report!”* Ramp Guy viciously growled, turning around and slamming his fists onto the countertop.

It was so loud it made me jump. Yet, Café Guy, his back turned to the noise, did not falter one bit. He continued humming Kumbaya as he opened up the microwave, popped the two sausage rolls into a brown paper bag, and turned back around to face the counter.

*“Here you are Sir! Two sausage rolls, as requested!”* He said, with an overly polite smile plastered across his face.

Ramp Guy snatched the bag without a shred of a thank you, and stood there for a moment longer, staring Café Guy down, fully aware he had been completely emasculated.

Clenching his fists, he spoke up again. *“Ya lucky I’m in a good mood today ya old geezer!”*

Café Guy simply chuckled at this, his composure not shaking one iota, as if he had seen far worse than this in his lifetime. He smiled at Ramp Guy, before quite genuinely wishing him a fantastic day ahead.

Ramp Guy stormed off at this point, stomping down the stairs just as loudly as he had come up them moments earlier. I heard the door to the lower deck copping some serious abuse on his way back out, as well as more than a few obscenities floating in through the windows as he made his way back to wherever the hell he disappeared to every day.

I looked back to Café Guy, my mouth agape. Getting up from my seat, I made my way over to him. *“Are you okay?”* I asked him.

Café Guy just smiled and laughed softly. *“These young ones! They think they own the show! Important to know one’s place, that’s what I always say!”*

Without me even asking, he began cooking up a variety of different pastries, fresh sandwiches and salads. I didn’t care what he was making for me, I was ravenous enough to eat absolutely anything by this stage. My energy levels were near on non-existent too, so my legs could attest as I fell backwards into one of the seats.

Café Guy noticed this, glancing over at me with a sombre look of concern on his face. Before long, he finished up what he was doing and packed all his creations into a bag for me, bringing it over along with a steaming hot cup of coffee. I was grateful for his presence on this otherwise awful ferry. It was nice to know I had a friend, despite everything else.

*“Here you are Sir,”* he said, handing me the food and the coffee. I didn’t even wait, grabbing out one of the beef and potato pies and taking a voracious chomp into its hearty goodness. I realised part way through my shameless display that Café Guy was staring at me. He wasn’t annoyed or anything, no, for the first time he actually looked like his rock solid composure might break, as though he was trying to hold back a fit of laughter.

*“Oh my God… I’m sorry! Geez… Thanks mate. I appreciate it! It’s um… it’s really good!”* I stammered out, laughing a little myself as I did so and taking a sip of my coffee in an attempt to bridge myself back into a state of civility. Café Guy chuckled softly and shook his head a little, but after a moment that spark of happiness left his face. He suddenly looked sombre, and he just stared for a moment before speaking up again.

*“You need to be more careful young man. You’re lucky we found you all the way out there! I’m sure you know this by now, but there are more to these waters we sail than meets the eye.”*

Finishing up my mouthful of pie, I nodded my head in response. *“Yeah… I sure do. I saw something down there early this morning, after they pulled me out of the water. It was huge. I’m pretty sure whatever it was had been trying to grab me when I was in the ocean…”* I said, turning to face him now.

Café Guy slowly shook his head, before looking me in the eyes as he spoke again. *“If one of those wanted to take you, you’d be gone.”*

I froze upon hearing those words. The way he just matter of factly said it chilled me. So many thoughts ran through my brain all at once. There was more than one of them? What were they? What was their purpose? And… “*if”* it wanted to take me…? Is that the only reason I’m still breathing? Because this thing was in a good mood? The weight of the dread I felt in that moment was crushing, thinking back to my helpless self floating in that water. I shuddered at the thought of it.

Café Guy noticed this and placed a hand gently on my shoulder. He spoke once more in that calming tone of his. *“Don’t you dwell on it sir. Things have a way of working out in the end,”* he said, before taking a glance down at his watch. He stood up, walking back over to the café and crouching down. He pulled out his set of keys and opened up a small locker beneath the counter. He pulled out a neatly packed bag, before locking back up, standing up and walking back over to me.

*“I have a feeling you need these more than me,”* he said, looking down at my still damp clothes. *“They’re freshly washed and ironed, they should fit you. No need to give them back. I shan’t be needing them.”*

I glanced back at him, smiling a little myself now. *“Thanks mate… I appreciate you. I mean, I still don’t know what your deal is here, but you’ve been kind to me, and if by some miracle I make it back to the real world, I won’t forget it,”* I said to him, before reaching out my hand to shake his. He accepted my gesture, firmly shaking my hand, before turning and walking away.

So there I was again. Just me and the ferry, and the ever increasing number of strange passengers boarding it. I had given up hope of trying to get off this thing. If what I experienced in the sea, or what I had witnessed out there on our many travels, was any indication of what the world outside had become, it seemed that I was safer in here than I was out there. 

For now though, I just wanted to get comfortable. Placing my bag of food down on my row of seats, I took the clothes Café Guy had given me and made my way downstairs to the bathroom to get changed. As I stepped down off the final step, I scanned the lower level of the ferry, noticing that both sides had now almost filled up. There must have been some more… “stops”, in the time that I was floating out there.

Looking around the crowd, I noticed that some of the passengers we were picking up were looking less and less human. In the beginning, when I first noticed this shift in appearance, it was subtle. Like I said, the kind of human-LIKE appearance you get from some AI image generators. But now, this was even more pronounced. Some of the figures seated in the back right hand rows had these thick, rubbery looking heads sporting blank, almost faceless expressions as they turned their gaze toward me.

Others were very unnaturally tall and thin, looking like they had been placed between two giant vice clamps and forcibly stretched out. Then some among the crowd had almost no human appearance what so ever, humanoid in shape being as close as they got. Many of them looked to have been pulled straight from the sea just as I was, their bodies covered in seaweed with clams and barnacles still hanging off soggy flaps of skin.

I quickly looked away from these humanoid “nothing-people”, as I had come to refer to them, as I noticed almost all of them were staring at me now. They were making me feel uneasy, and I didn’t like it. The fact that they just sat there and stared was in some ways worse than if they had been doing anything outright malicious. I slipped my way past the back row of seats, shivering as my arm brushed against the scraggly mess of dank, wet hair belonging to one of the passengers. I quickened my pace, rounding the corner and shutting myself inside the bathroom to change. 

Opening up the bag, I found a set of blue jeans and a white polo shirt. Very casual, I thought. Thanks Café Guy! I quickly changed into the dry clothes, stepped out and chucked my now surely ruined set into the trash. I sighed as I glanced out over the deck. We were back in Sydney Harbour once again, a sight I once cherished every time I laid eyes on it, but now? A landscape of pure dread. There was no one out there now. I don’t mean like the first couple of times where I could at least see shadows of people in the distance. This time there was just… no one.

I woefully turned my gaze away from this depressing landscape and made my way back upstairs to my row of seats. The upper floor was now my one and only safe haven away from the nothing-people. Even the group of convicts that had tried to attack me last night had now made their way down the stairs to join the rest of them, neatly sat in rows, all facing straight ahead, aside from their dopey stares toward me whenever I would show myself around them. 

It seemed the only time they ever broke from this trance was to herd themselves up the stairs and get their morning meals. Sitting down in my little corner, I grabbed out a sandwich and started munching away as the ferry made its way through the harbour once again. I wasn’t even all that shocked anymore, as I glanced out at the rotting scenery around me.

Once again, same as yesterday, the ferry started pulling in to various ports, and again, they looked absolutely nothing like I had once known them to. The Maritime Museum wharf, which proudly houses the HMAS Vampire, now featured only the decaying hull of a ship half sunken in the harbour. Its bones were bare and rotting, little mud crabs crawling all over it. As I gazed down upon it, I could see figures trapped within. More nothing-people, some of them still desperately trying to pull themselves out. 

As we began to sail out of the harbour and back toward the Parramatta River, I dared not look as we passed by Goat Island. I could see enough merely out of the corners of my vision to deter me from directly looking. There were numerous of them, stomping their way across the shores. They were massive, whatever the hell they were. Like the scary giants from childrens’ fairy tales. I shifted away from the window and into one of the centre rows of seats, afraid that they might reach out for me.

Onwards we sailed. Up and down the river and around and about the harbour, continuing this now monotonous routine of pulling into random stops, some I didn’t even know existed, and picking up more travellers. I stayed put right where I was, but every time a new group of them would board, my eyes stayed locked on the stairwell ahead of me, silently praying that none of them would make their way up here again.

It must have been nearing about 4pm that day when it happened. I was out on deck getting some fresh air, just watching out over the water ahead, when I noticed the ferry was picking up speed. It was moving unusually fast, and this was making me nervous, but not near as much as what came next. I gripped the rail tight as the ferry began to turn, our heading now directed straight into the bank of the river. 

I thought this must be a mistake. I was sure that at any moment we would adjust our course back out into open space. But we didn’t, we only picked up speed. We were about 20 metres from the shoreline now, and I was just about to jump off the side again when I remembered the words from earlier…

*“Please keep well away from the water. I repeat, no matter what you see, STAY AWAY FROM THE WATER!”*

Now mere moments away from smashing into the shoreline, I grabbed the railing as tight as I possibly could, and crouched down behind the barrier, bracing for the oncoming impact! 

… But no impact came.

Suddenly, my grip loosened, as my eyes met the impossible sight ahead of me. With an unearthly groan, the land itself began to morph before my very eyes. Within seconds, a new passage of water had opened up, a mass of twisted mangroves forming a tunnel around it. At speed, we blasted through the opening, as a crash of thunder erupted from the sky, much like when we had entered Botany Bay, and I cringed in terror, once again fearing I may be struck down by lightning.

But all was quiet, and the ferry began to slow its pace now. As I rose back up to my feet, I looked around in astonishment at the surroundings we now found ourselves within. We were trekking through a mangrove ridden swampland, the buzz of mosquitos and the stink of the muddy riverbank thick in the air. 

I was well travelled, and there was only one place in this country I had witnessed this kind of scenery. A soft clunk against the hull of the ferry, and the swish of a thick, reptilian tail disappearing beneath the water confirmed what I was thinking. We were not in Sydney anymore, we were traversing through a northern mangrove river.

My head began to spin. I’m not sure why. Surely I should be used to this madness by now, but somehow this damned ferry managed to up the stakes yet again. I stumbled backwards, turning around to go back inside, when I was met with the sight of yet another crocodile. This one, its head slightly elevated out of the water, as they tend to do before they jump, its jaws open slightly. 

I kept my eyes locked on it, ready to throw myself backward should it make a move, but not wanting to be the one to move first and startle it into striking. It kept its eyes locked on me the whole time as we slowly passed it by, before disappearing back beneath the muddy waters. 

The ferry gurgled along through this murky hellscape, as the world around me became progressively weirder. Dark mists were now rising up out of the water, and more creatures began swimming around, circling the vessel. The more I got a good look at them, the more I realised how wrong I had been. 

They were not crocodiles. Too big. Even the most monstrous of crocs ever seen in Australia capped out at around eight and a half metres. These things circling the boat were at least twice that, looking more like the ancient Sarcosuchus than a modern day crocodilian. I took another couple of steps back, and suddenly, the P.A. system crackled to life again…

*“Attention! For your own safety, remain inside the ferry. Stay away from the water, and do not look outside.”*

That was a new one, and I shuddered at the thoughts of what must be lurking out there for this monstrous beings on board this vessel to be warning me not to even look out there. But hey, they didn’t need to tell me twice. I quickly, yet quietly, made my way back inside and took my seat again, this time, keeping my eyes front much like the nothing-people. For hours we sailed through this natural maze, until I finally felt the ferry begin to swing in to a stop. Once again, the P.A. system exploded with static…

*“Attention! Remain inside the vessel! Keep your eyes closed! I repeat! KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED!”*

Catching sight of the long, twisted jetty winding out from within the dark mangroves ahead, and the barest glimpse of the tall, stretched out *things* lined up along it, I did exactly what the P.A. voice instructed. I squeezed my eyes shut tightly and did everything I could to turn my focus away from what was outside. A screeching sound rang out as the ferry swung in to dock, followed by the regular clangs out on deck as Ramp Guy hurled the now busted up metal foot bridge out onto the pier for these awful beings to board the ship.

I could hear quiet whispers, along with the soft buzz of insects and the lapping of the water against the shoreline. I then heard the tapping of what sounded like sharp, pointed feet, clicking their way across the ramp. And finally, I heard the sound of the ramp being pulled back in and the gates latching shut. The ferry then floated there for a few more minutes, as I heard the new arrivals getting seated downstairs, their whispers now fading away as they no doubt joined the rest of the mindless drones in their ever present state of nothingness. Once I could hear them no more, and was satisfied that they were of no threat to me, I opened my eyes…

… *“Please don’t be real,”* I thought, as I immediately shut my eyes once again.

Something… Was looking straight at me. Through the window. Right next to my head. 

The window was only half closed, leaving no barrier between us. I dared not continue to look, but what I saw was enough. It was clung to the windowsill, its face half pressed against the glass. The rest of its body hung limp across the deck of the ferry, its legs dangling out over the side. I pressed my eyes shut as tightly as I could, as I felt its breath on my neck, and heard it whispering in my ear.

*“Can you help me?”* It said, between ragged breaths.

I slid myself over to the farthest seat in the row I was in, but even then I could still feel its breath, and I could now feel its hand, sliding up against me, as if it were desperately trying to grab onto me.

*“Please… help me…”* It spoke again.

I once again felt a slimy hand uselessly attempting to grasp at my arm. I was crying silent tears now. I wanted to get up and run, but I did not know what else was around me. Perhaps I would be running straight into another of its kind.

*“Help… me…”* It spoke just one more time. The ferry began to pull away from the jetty, and I heard it slide off the deck, and plop into the water. Its fate from that point? I do not know. Not once did I open my eyes again as the ferry continued sailing through this otherworldly land. 

Every so often, I would hear the ferry pick up pace, followed by that familiar crash of thunder again, before slowing down and continuing to make more stops. All the while, I could hear things boarding the vessel. Some would speak in tongues I could not possibly understand. Others spoke in languages I recognised, but did not know. Spanish, Mandarin, a variety of Asian and European languages as well as many others. I would hear the odd American or British accent, and in amongst it all I would also hear terrifying voices. Mixtures of groans, clicks and gurgles. All manner of specimens were being herded onto this ferry. But for what? I had no idea.

It wasn’t until we were back in Sydney Harbour that I opened my eyes again, and how I wish I had not. The ferry picked up pace, roaring through yet another of these apparent portals, and once we were through, I heard the familiar sounds of the harbour once more, feeling comfortable enough to look outside. First glance was not enough. I had to be certain of what I was seeing. I closed my eyes, shook my head, and looked again.

As the ferry slowly sailed down the harbour, a terrible sight lay before me. Sydney was no more. I mean, it was there, kind of. The beautiful cityscape I had gazed upon so many times, was now an apocalyptic wasteland. 

The Sydney Tower, once standing proudly high above the city, had been snapped off midway up. The buildings were in ruins. The Sydney Harbour Bridge lay in shambles, broken off in the centre, each side hanging downward. 

I watched in horror as hordes of these nothing-people wandered across the decaying bridge from both ends, toppling into the harbour as they reached the tipping point in the centre. The Opera House, once a proud symbol of our beautiful city, now lay in pieces, its iconic sails scattered all over.

I turned away from this nightmare, forcing my eyes to look at anything else. But what I saw inside was no better. The ferry was almost full now. Many more nothing-people had entered the vessel during our ventures down that river, and wherever the hell else we had been. All over the world, by the sounds of things. The upper floor was no longer my safe haven away from them, as it too was now almost full, the entire opposite side filled with figures taking all manner of forms. All of them, staring squarely at me.

I looked away from them, feeling uneasy, yet relatively assured that if the previous days were any indication, once they were boarded and seated, they meant me no harm.

The ferry continued to sail up and down the harbour, and a few more stops and pickups were made. All the while I tried my best to relax, to sit back and not draw any attention to myself. And I managed to do just that. Even as my own side of the ferry began to fill up with boarding travellers, I somehow managed to keep my head. That was until the end of the day.

It was around 7pm that night when the ferry went down. No… I don’t mean it powered down for the night. I mean it dropped ***straight down!***

Any composure I had managed to maintain went out the window as I tucked myself down in my seat, preparing for the rush of cold water to pour in through the open doors and windows, trapping us all in this underwater coffin. But… It didn’t.

I was instead suddenly surrounded by utter silence, save for a dull wind, audible, yet I could feel nothing on my skin through the windows. I slowly raised my head and opened my eyes, noticing the pitched black night sky outside. Had I imagined what just happened? I could have sworn to God this ferry had just dropped straight down underneath the water. I saw it. I felt it happen! But alas, there was the night sky, right there. I could not hear the typical sounds of the harbour anymore, and I wondered if we were even still in Sydney.

I got up from my seat, intending to take a look outside at what was going on. Slowly, I slid open the door to the Starboard side deck, and I very carefully stepped out, painfully aware of the many hidden threats that may lie waiting out there. What met my eyes this time, however, was so much worse than anything I had yet seen on this journey.

As I gazed over the side of that ferry, seeing no water at all beneath us, and observing the little green and blue ball suspended in vast, black nothingness, slowly disappearing into the darkness we were now floating off into, I realised with a dizzying horror…

Not only were we not in Sydney Harbour anymore…

I’m a coffee lover and drink it every day, sometimes twice a day. Over time, I started noticing that after drinking regular coffee I felt more stressed than usual. Completely cutting it out was really hard, so I decided to try decaf instead. I drank only decaf for about a month using one test package.

I definitely noticed a difference. For the last two weeks I went back to regular coffee because I got some as a gift and my decaf ran out. After switching back, I noticed my heartbeat feels stronger and I feel more anxious, stressed, or overly excited. When I was drinking decaf, I felt much calmer and more relaxed.

Today I bought another pack of decaf and I’m switching back to monitor how I feel over a longer period. I’ve also started choosing herbal teas instead of regular tea.

So if you’re on the fence about trying decaf, I’d recommend buying a small package and seeing how it affects you. For me, the taste is pretty same to regular coffee.",3,1766228742.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False
1prbwag,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1prbwag/how_to_use_vpn_in_incognito_mode/,How to Use VPN in Incognito Mode,">✅ **Quick Answer:** Yes, VPNs work with incognito mode, but they serve different purposes. Incognito mode stops your browser from saving local history, while a VPN encrypts your connection and hides your IP address from external observers. Using both together provides layered privacy protection—your device won't remember what you did, and your ISP can't see where you went.

I've used VPNs in incognito mode for years, and I'm constantly surprised by how many people think incognito mode alone gives them complete privacy. It doesn't. **Incognito mode** is local device privacy—it prevents your browser from remembering your session. **A VPN** is network privacy—it prevents everyone else from seeing what you're doing online.

Let me show you exactly how to combine these tools effectively.

# Understanding What You're Actually Getting

Before we dive into setup, you need to understand what each tool does—and what it *doesn't* do.

# What Incognito Mode Actually Does

|✅ What It Protects|❌ What It Doesn't Protect|
|:-|:-|
|Local browsing history|Your IP address|
|Cookies and site data (during session)|ISP monitoring|
|Form autofill data|Website tracking|
|Search history on the device|Employer/school network monitoring|
|Login sessions (after closing)|Government surveillance|

*Incognito mode* (also called *Private Browsing* in Firefox and Safari, or *InPrivate* in Edge) creates an isolated browser session. When you close the window, your browser forgets everything that happened—no saved history, no cookies, no cached files.

>📖 **Definition:** Incognito mode is a browser feature that prevents local storage of browsing data. It's privacy from other people using your device, not privacy from the internet itself.

**Here's the critical part most people miss:** Your internet service provider (ISP), network administrator, and the websites you visit can still see **everything** you do in incognito mode. They see your real IP address, your physical location, and every site you visit. Incognito doesn't hide you from external observers—it only hides you from someone checking your browser history later.

# What a VPN Actually Does

|✅ What It Protects|❌ What It Doesn't Protect|
|:-|:-|
|Your IP address (replaces with VPN server IP)|Local browsing history|
|Traffic from ISP monitoring|Cookies on your device|
|Data on public WiFi|Login credentials stored locally|
|Geographic location|Website tracking if you're logged in|
|DNS queries from ISP|Browser fingerprinting (partially)|

A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** encrypts your internet connection and routes it through a remote server. This masks your real IP address and makes it appear you're browsing from the VPN server's location. Your ISP can see you're connected to a VPN, but they can't see which websites you visit or what data you're sending.

>🔒 **Security Note:** VPNs encrypt your traffic using protocols like `WireGuard` or `OpenVPN` with `AES-256` encryption. This scrambles your data so intermediaries can't read it, even if they intercept it.

**The limitation:** A VPN doesn't erase your browsing history from your device. If someone opens your laptop after you've been browsing with a VPN, they'll see every website you visited in your browser history—unless you also used incognito mode.

# Why Use VPN and Incognito Mode Together?

When you combine both tools, you create **layered privacy protection** that covers multiple attack surfaces:

**The VPN protects you from:**

* Your internet service provider seeing your browsing activity
* Network administrators at work, school, or public WiFi monitoring your traffic
* Hackers intercepting your data on unsecured networks
* Websites knowing your real location and IP address

**Incognito mode protects you from:**

* Other users of your device seeing your browsing history
* Cookies tracking you across websites (within that session)
* Autofill accidentally revealing sensitive searches
* Login sessions persisting after you're done

>💡 **Pro Tip:** I always use both when accessing sensitive accounts on public WiFi or shared computers. The VPN prevents network eavesdropping, and incognito ensures I don't accidentally leave login credentials saved on the device.

|Scenario|VPN Only|Incognito Only|VPN + Incognito|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Browsing at coffee shop|ISP can't see sites, but cookies remain|History cleared, but WiFi admin sees everything|✅ Full protection|
|Using work computer|Employer blocked, history saved|History cleared, employer sees sites|✅ Full protection|
|Streaming geo-blocked content|Access granted, history saved|History cleared, content still blocked|✅ Access + privacy|
|Online banking on shared device|Secure connection, session might persist|Session cleared, traffic visible to ISP|✅ Secure + clean|

# How to Use VPN Apps with Incognito Mode

Using a **full VPN application** (not a browser extension) with incognito mode is straightforward because VPN apps operate at the system level—they encrypt all your internet traffic regardless of which browser or mode you're using.

# Step 1: Install and Connect Your VPN App

1. **Download a VPN app** from a reputable provider (I recommend looking for providers with independent security audits, strict no-logs policies, and modern protocols like `WireGuard`)
2. **Install the application** on your device
3. **Launch the VPN app** and sign in
4. **Connect to a server** (choose based on your needs—nearby for speed, specific country for geo-unblocking)
5. **Verify the connection** is active (most apps show a status indicator)

Once connected, the VPN encrypts **all traffic** from your device, including your web browser.

# Step 2: Open Incognito Mode in Your Browser

With the VPN already running, open an incognito window:

|Browser|Keyboard Shortcut|Menu Path|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Chrome**|Ctrl+Shift+N (Win) / Cmd+Shift+N (Mac)|⋮ Menu → New Incognito Window|
|**Firefox**|Ctrl+Shift+P (Win) / Cmd+Shift+P (Mac)|☰ Menu → New Private Window|
|**Edge**|Ctrl+Shift+N (Win) / Cmd+Shift+N (Mac)|⋯ Menu → New InPrivate Window|
|**Safari**|Cmd+Shift+N (Mac only)|File → New Private Window|
|**Brave**|Ctrl+Shift+N (Win) / Cmd+Shift+N (Mac)|☰ Menu → New Private Window|

# Step 3: Verify Both Are Working

To confirm your setup is working correctly:

1. **Check your VPN connection:** Look for the VPN app's status indicator showing ""Connected""
2. **Visit an IP checker:** Go to a site like `whatismyipaddress.com` in your incognito window
3. **Verify the IP address:** It should show the VPN server's location, not your real location
4. **Check incognito status:** Look for the incognito icon (usually a hat/glasses) in your browser window

>⚡ **Performance Insight:** VPN apps typically add 5-20% speed overhead depending on server distance and protocol. `WireGuard`\-based protocols (like NordVPN's NordLynx) generally have lower overhead than older `OpenVPN` implementations.

**That's it.** When using a VPN app, there's no additional configuration needed for incognito mode. The VPN works system-wide, and incognito mode handles browser-level privacy independently.

# How to Use VPN Browser Extensions with Incognito Mode

Browser extensions are trickier because **they're disabled by default in incognito mode** for privacy reasons. You need to manually grant permission for each extension to run in private windows.

>⚠️ **Warning:** Only enable trusted VPN extensions in incognito mode. When you grant incognito access to an extension, it can monitor all your activity in private windows—defeating the purpose if the extension itself is collecting data.

# Enabling VPN Extensions in Google Chrome

1. **Open Chrome** and launch a new incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N or Cmd+Shift+N)
2. **Click the puzzle piece icon** (Extensions) in the top-right corner
3. **Select ""Manage Extensions""** or go to `chrome://extensions`
4. **Find your VPN extension** in the list
5. **Click ""Details""** below the extension name
6. **Scroll down** to find ""Allow in incognito""
7. **Toggle the switch ON**

!\[Chrome Extension Settings\]

The VPN extension will now work in incognito windows. You'll need to **manually connect** to a VPN server from the extension each time you open a new incognito session—it won't auto-connect unless configured to do so.

# Enabling VPN Extensions in Mozilla Firefox

1. **Open Firefox** and launch a new private window (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
2. **Click the menu button** (three horizontal lines) in the top-right
3. **Select ""Add-ons and Themes""** or press Ctrl+Shift+A
4. **Click ""Extensions""** in the left sidebar
5. **Find your VPN extension** in the list
6. **Click the three-dot menu** next to the extension
7. **Select ""Manage""**
8. **Scroll to ""Run in Private Windows""**
9. **Select ""Allow""**

Firefox requires this step for each extension you want to use in private windows.

# Enabling VPN Extensions in Microsoft Edge

1. **Open Edge** and launch an InPrivate window (Ctrl+Shift+N or Cmd+Shift+N)
2. **Click the three-dot menu** in the top-right corner
3. **Select ""Extensions""**
4. **Click ""Manage extensions""**
5. **Find your VPN extension**
6. **Click ""Details""** under the extension name
7. **Toggle ON** ""Allow in InPrivate""

Edge's process mirrors Chrome's since both are Chromium-based browsers.

# Enabling VPN Extensions in Brave

1. **Open Brave** and launch a private window (Ctrl+Shift+N or Cmd+Shift+N)
2. **Click the menu** (three horizontal lines) in the top-right
3. **Go to ""Extensions""** → ""Manage Extensions""
4. **Find your VPN extension**
5. **Click ""Details""**
6. **Enable ""Allow in Private Windows with Tor""** (this also covers standard private windows)

# Using Safari (macOS Only)

Safari handles extensions differently—most extensions work automatically in Private Browsing windows without requiring permission changes. However, Safari has limited VPN extension support. For Safari, I recommend using a **full VPN app** instead of relying on browser extensions.

>💡 **Pro Tip:** After enabling your VPN extension in incognito mode, verify it's actually encrypting traffic by checking your IP address at `whoer.net` or `ipleak.net`. These sites show whether your real IP is leaking despite the VPN connection.

# Best Practices for VPN + Incognito Mode

After years of using this combination, here are the workflows I've found most effective:

# 1. Always Connect VPN First

**Never** open an incognito window and then connect your VPN. Do it in this order:

1. Launch VPN app or extension
2. Wait for connection confirmation
3. Then open incognito window

Why? If you connect the VPN *after* opening incognito, your initial connection might leak your real IP address to the first sites you visit.

# 2. Verify Connection Before Sensitive Activity

Before accessing anything sensitive (banking, private accounts, confidential work), verify both protections:

* **VPN status:** Check the VPN app/extension shows ""Connected""
* **IP verification:** Confirm your IP shows the VPN server location
* **Incognito confirmation:** Ensure you see the incognito icon in your browser window

>🔒 **Security Note:** Look for VPNs with **kill switch** functionality. This automatically blocks internet access if your VPN connection drops, preventing accidental exposure of your real IP.

# 3. Close Incognito Windows Completely When Done

To ensure all data is cleared:

1. **Close all incognito/private windows** (not just tabs—close the entire window)
2. **Verify windows are closed** (some browsers keep incognito windows minimized)
3. **Disconnect the VPN** if you're done needing it

*Incognito mode* only wipes data when you close **all** incognito windows. Leaving one tab open keeps the session active.

# 4. Use Connection-Specific Server Selection

Choose VPN servers strategically based on what you're doing:

|Activity|Recommended Server Location|Why|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**General browsing**|Closest geographic server|Lowest latency, best speeds|
|**Streaming US content**|US-based servers|Access geo-restricted libraries|
|**Privacy-focused browsing**|Privacy-friendly jurisdictions (Switzerland, Iceland)|Strong data protection laws|
|**Public WiFi protection**|Any server (encryption matters most)|Prevents local network snooping|
|**Work/school bypass**|Server in different country|Circumvents network restrictions|

# 5. Don't Mix Personal and Private Sessions

Avoid this common mistake:

❌ **Don't:** Have regular browser windows open while using incognito + VPN for sensitive activity  
✅ **Do:** Close all regular windows and use only incognito when maximum privacy is needed

Why? Cookies and tracking scripts from regular windows can still identify you through browser fingerprinting, even if your incognito window is clean.

# 6. Be Aware of Login Tracking

**Critical limitation:** If you log into accounts (Google, Facebook, email) while using VPN + incognito, those services can still track your activity on their platforms.

>⚠️ **Warning:** Logging into your Google account in incognito mode while connected to a VPN doesn't prevent Google from seeing what you do while logged in. The VPN hides your IP from Google, and incognito prevents local history storage, but Google still associates your activity with your account.

# Choosing the Right VPN for Incognito Use

Not all VPNs are created equal, especially when you're serious about privacy. Here's what to look for:

# Essential Features for Privacy

|Feature|Why It Matters|What to Look For|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**No-Logs Policy**|VPN provider shouldn't store your activity|Independent audits verifying claims|
|**Strong Encryption**|Protects data from interception|`AES-256` encryption with modern protocols|
|**Kill Switch**|Prevents IP leaks if VPN drops|Automatic internet blocking on disconnect|
|**DNS Leak Protection**|Stops DNS requests from exposing sites|Built-in DNS servers, automatic leak prevention|
|**Modern Protocol**|Better speeds and security|`WireGuard` or enhanced variants|
|**Jurisdiction**|Affects data request compliance|Non-Five-Eyes countries (Panama, Switzerland, British Virgin Islands)|

# VPN Apps vs. Browser Extensions

In my testing, full VPN apps outperform browser extensions in nearly every category:

|Aspect|VPN App|Browser Extension|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Protection Scope**|Entire device|Browser only|
|**Setup Complexity**|One-time install|Must enable in incognito|
|**Performance**|Better (native implementation)|Can be slower (proxy-based)|
|**Features**|Full feature set|Limited features|
|**Kill Switch**|Yes|Rarely available|
|**Best For**|Complete privacy protection|Quick location changes|

>💡 **Pro Tip:** For maximum security, use a VPN app rather than a browser extension. Apps like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and Surfshark provide complete system-wide encryption, kill switches, and DNS leak protection—features often missing from browser extensions. Many browser extensions are just **proxies** that only hide your IP without encrypting traffic.

Look for VPNs that have undergone **multiple independent security audits**. Providers that submit to regular third-party audits demonstrate transparency about their no-logs claims and security practices.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

# Mistake #1: Thinking Incognito Alone Makes You Anonymous

**The problem:** Incognito mode doesn't hide your IP address or encrypt your traffic.

**The reality:** Your ISP, network administrator, and websites still see your real IP and location in incognito mode. It's only hiding your activity from other users of your device.

**The fix:** Always use a VPN alongside incognito when you need true online privacy.

# Mistake #2: Trusting Free VPNs in Incognito Mode

**The problem:** Many free VPNs log your data and sell it to advertisers.

**The reality:** If you're not paying for the product, *you are the product*. Free VPNs need revenue, and many generate it by collecting and monetizing user data—exactly what you're trying to avoid.

**The fix:** Use reputable paid VPN services with verified no-logs policies. Most offer money-back guarantees so you can test them risk-free.

# Mistake #3: Not Checking for IP Leaks

**The problem:** Assuming your VPN is working without verification.

**The reality:** VPNs can leak your real IP through DNS leaks, WebRTC leaks, or connection failures.

**The fix:** Regularly test for leaks using sites like:

* `ipleak.net` (comprehensive leak test)
* `dnsleaktest.com` (DNS-specific)
* `whoer.net` (overall anonymity rating)

# Mistake #4: Leaving Incognito Windows Open Indefinitely

**The problem:** Keeping incognito windows open for hours or days.

**The reality:** The longer an incognito session runs, the more cookies and tracking data accumulate. Closing the window wipes everything.

**The fix:** Close incognito windows when you're done with a browsing session. Start fresh each time you need private browsing.

# Mistake #5: Using Incognito for Banking on Untrusted Networks

**The problem:** Relying on incognito mode alone when accessing financial accounts on public WiFi.

**The reality:** Incognito mode doesn't encrypt your connection. Anyone on the same network can potentially intercept your traffic.

**The fix:** **Always** use a VPN when accessing sensitive accounts on public WiFi, whether in incognito mode or not.

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

# Problem: VPN Extension Not Appearing in Incognito

**Symptoms:** Your VPN extension works in regular windows but doesn't show up in incognito mode.

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify you enabled incognito access:** Go to your browser's extension settings and confirm ""Allow in incognito"" is toggled ON
2. **Restart the browser:** Close all windows (including incognito) and relaunch
3. **Reinstall the extension:** Remove and reinstall, then re-enable incognito access
4. **Check for browser updates:** Outdated browsers can have compatibility issues

# Problem: IP Address Shows Real Location Despite VPN

**Symptoms:** IP checker sites show your actual location, not the VPN server.

**Solutions:**

1. **Disconnect and reconnect:** Sometimes VPN connections fail silently
2. **Try a different server:** The current server might be misconfigured
3. **Check for leaks:** Use `ipleak.net` to identify WebRTC or DNS leaks
4. **Disable WebRTC in browser:** Many browsers leak IP through WebRTC even with VPN active
5. **Switch to VPN app:** Browser extensions are more prone to leaks than full apps

# Problem: Websites Blocking VPN Access

**Symptoms:** Sites show ""VPN detected"" messages or block access entirely.

**Solutions:**

1. **Switch to a different VPN server:** Some IP addresses are blacklisted more than others
2. **Look for obfuscated servers:** Premium VPNs offer stealth servers designed to bypass VPN detection
3. **Clear cookies:** Websites might be identifying you through stored cookies rather than IP
4. **Use residential IP VPNs:** Some services offer residential IPs less likely to be flagged

# Problem: Slower Speeds in Incognito + VPN

**Symptoms:** Browsing feels sluggish when using both tools together.

**Solutions:**

1. **Choose nearby servers:** Distance increases latency
2. **Test different VPN protocols:** `WireGuard` is generally faster than `OpenVPN`
3. **Close unnecessary extensions:** Each extension adds overhead
4. **Check base internet speed:** Test without VPN to establish baseline
5. **Upgrade VPN plan:** Budget VPNs often have slower servers

>⚡ **Performance Insight:** Expect a 5-20% speed reduction with VPNs on nearby servers. If you're seeing 50%+ slowdowns, the issue is likely server congestion or protocol inefficiency—try different servers or protocols.

# Advanced Privacy Techniques

Once you're comfortable with basic VPN + incognito usage, these advanced strategies provide even stronger privacy:

# Multi-Hop VPN Connections

Some VPN providers offer **double VPN** or **multi-hop** routing, which sends your traffic through multiple VPN servers in sequence. This adds an extra layer of anonymization.

**How it works:**

* Your traffic goes: You → VPN Server 1 → VPN Server 2 → Destination
* Even if one server is compromised, your identity stays protected
* Adds latency but significantly increases privacy

**VPNs with multi-hop:** NordVPN (Double VPN), Surfshark (MultiHop), ProtonVPN (Secure Core)

# Browser Fingerprinting Protection

VPNs and incognito mode don't fully protect against *browser fingerprinting*—websites identifying you based on your browser's unique characteristics (fonts, screen resolution, plugins, etc.).

**Additional protection:**

* Use privacy-focused browsers like **Brave** or **Firefox** with fingerprinting protection
* Install extensions like **Privacy Badger** or **uBlock Origin**
* Disable JavaScript on high-privacy sites (reduces functionality but blocks many tracking methods)

# Tor + VPN Combination

For maximum anonymity, combine VPN with the Tor browser:

**Setup:** VPN → Tor → Internet

**Benefits:**

* VPN hides Tor usage from your ISP
* Tor provides onion routing through multiple encrypted nodes
* Near-complete anonymity if configured correctly

**Drawbacks:**

* Very slow speeds (expect 70-80% reduction)
* Some sites block Tor exit nodes
* Overkill for most use cases

>🎯 **Bottom Line:** VPN + incognito mode provides solid privacy for everyday users. Reserve Tor for situations requiring maximum anonymity, like whistleblowing or operating in highly restrictive regions.

# Real-World Use Cases

Here's when I actually use VPN + incognito mode together:

**1. Public WiFi Access**  
*Scenario:* Coffee shop, airport, hotel WiFi  
*Why both:* VPN prevents network eavesdropping; incognito ensures I don't leave saved passwords on someone else's network

**2. Accessing Work Accounts from Personal Devices**  
*Scenario:* Checking work email from home computer  
*Why both:* VPN masks my location from work monitoring; incognito keeps work login credentials off my personal browser

**3. Price Comparison Shopping**  
*Scenario:* Booking flights, hotels, comparing insurance quotes  
*Why both:* VPN prevents dynamic pricing based on location; incognito stops cookies from tracking repeated searches

**4. Streaming Regional Content**  
*Scenario:* Accessing Netflix libraries from other countries  
*Why both:* VPN spoofs location; incognito prevents streaming service from associating viewing history with my account permanently

**5. Researching Sensitive Topics**  
*Scenario:* Medical information, legal questions, personal issues  
*Why both:* VPN hides searches from ISP; incognito keeps them out of autocomplete and history

# FAQ: Quick Answers

**Does incognito mode hide my IP address?**  
No. Incognito mode only prevents your browser from saving local data. Your IP address remains visible to websites, ISPs, and network administrators. You need a VPN to mask your IP address.

**Can I use a free VPN with incognito mode?**  
Technically yes, but I don't recommend it. Free VPNs often log data, inject ads, limit bandwidth, or sell browsing history—defeating the privacy purpose. If budget is tight, look for paid VPNs with money-back guarantees.

**Will VPN + incognito mode make me completely anonymous?**  
No. While this combination significantly improves privacy, true anonymity requires additional measures like Tor, disabling JavaScript, avoiding logged-in accounts, and using privacy-focused operating systems.

**Do I need to reconnect my VPN every time I open incognito mode?**  
With VPN apps: No—the VPN runs system-wide regardless of browser mode.  
With browser extensions: Yes—you typically need to manually activate the extension in each new incognito window.

**Can my employer or school still track me if I use VPN + incognito?**  
It depends. If you're on a managed device (company laptop with monitoring software), they can still see your activity regardless of VPN or incognito. On your personal device using their network, a VPN encrypts your traffic so they can't see which sites you visit—only that you're using a VPN.

**Does using both together slow down my internet?**  
The VPN adds overhead (typically 5-20% speed reduction), but incognito mode itself doesn't affect speed. The combination shouldn't be significantly slower than using a VPN alone.

# Final Thoughts

VPN and incognito mode aren't competing solutions—they're **complementary tools** that address different privacy concerns. Incognito mode is local privacy (hiding from other device users), while VPNs provide network privacy (hiding from ISPs, network admins, and websites).

The most important takeaway: **Incognito mode alone is not private browsing.** It's a misconception that's led to countless privacy breaches. If you want actual online privacy, you need a VPN—and if you want to keep your browsing off your local device too, add incognito mode.

In my experience, the combination of a quality VPN app (not just a browser extension) with incognito mode provides excellent privacy for 95% of everyday use cases. It's not perfect anonymity, but it dramatically reduces your digital footprint and protects sensitive information from the most common tracking methods.

>🎯 **Bottom Line:** Use a VPN app for network-level privacy and encryption. Use incognito mode for local history protection. Combine them whenever you're accessing sensitive information, using public WiFi, or simply want layered privacy protection. Neither one alone is sufficient—together, they create robust everyday privacy.

For situations requiring maximum anonymity—whistleblowing, political dissent in authoritarian regimes, or evading targeted surveillance—you'll need additional tools like Tor, privacy-focused operating systems, and careful operational security practices.",1,1766228722.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

(I'm not saying there are absolutely no problems.)  
Some GUI applications prove rather tricky to launch, particularly those involving the GPU.  
And occasionally, shell scripts that run only upon initial launch may not function correctly, and there is still room for improvement.

## Version 0.0.1

Pros/Cons. 

- ✅️A fairly turnkey ""boot to desktop"" system as Official Image.  
- ✅️GPU/Audio and misc drivers are preinstalled.  
- ✅️Discontinuation of packages that do not move or restrict users.  
- ✅️Can be build with custom kernel(but **DO NOT CHANGE SUFFIXES**)  
- ❌️Still need tweak.  
- ❌️Still doesn't work with Console,X11,LightDM and SDDM. **GDM & Wayland Only.**  
- ❌️Incidentally, Console doesn't appear either.
- ❌️I'd not conducted detailed testing.
- ❌️not tested for NPU,GPIO,DSP as HW fuctions. 
- 🤪Oh, I am sorry, I forgot browser package preinstall
- ❔️Should I mirror the disk image somewhere?  

## 🔥Burn & Boot:  
Write using Balena Etcher or dd, just as with the official image.  

## 🤓Repository:

Hi everyone.

I recently moved back to my city for WFH after several years away. Most of my old friends and acquaintances have either moved out or are working in other cities. So, I am finding myself  without anyone to talk to or hang out with.

It has been over 3 months, and I haven’t had any proper conversation in person. I admit that I have been introverted while growing up, so I had fewer friends. It’s been a quiet few months, and I’d really like to meet new people and build some good conversations again.

A bit about me: when I am not working, I enjoy reading books of various genres. Some of the books which have left an impression upon me are Early Indians, The Silk Roads, India in Persianate Age, The Last Lecture, Crime and Punishment, Metamorphosis, Gunahon ka Devta, Wah bhi koi desh hain maharaj, etc.

I am also a cinephile. I enjoy watching movies from across the globe, especially horror movies. Some of my favorite movies are A fistful of dollars, Brahmayugam, Lapachhapi, Stalker, A Separation, The Salesman, Impetigore, Parasite, and Train to Busan.

Apart from them, my minor hobbies include enjoying coffee, hiking, fitness, and cooking. But beware, my cooking skills are not that great as I am still in the learning phase, but I have perfected the art of making tea.

We were last in contact two months ago, during which we met three times and had sex once. I put a lot of effort into planning our dates, and she really enjoyed them. I eventually ended contact because she wasn’t ready for anything serious, but she didn’t want something casual either (which made me wonder why she was meeting me in the first place). In the end, I broke off contact to protect myself, because I had started developing feelings for her.

In the time that followed, I couldn’t forget her, even when I dated someone else. One evening, we ran into each other again at a bar, but we didn’t talk. The next day, she replied to one of my stories, saying she was surprised that I had been there too. We exchanged a few messages, but that was it (this was a month ago).

Two days ago, I messaged her and asked if she would like to go for a coffee with me. I want to see whether anything has changed in her situation. She replied after eight hours: ‘Hello, sorry for the late reply :) Do you mean just meeting in a friendly way?’ I answered: ‘Maybe not directly on a purely friendly level, but rather to see in a relaxed way where the conversation leads.

The platform smelled like coffee and wet concrete.

Daniel stood there watching the train pull away, doors closing one by one. He didn’t run. He didn’t swear. He just checked the time and exhaled.

Missing the train wasn’t new.
Missing chances was.

Two years earlier, he’d turned down a transfer that felt risky. Last year, he didn’t apply for a role because he didn’t “feel ready.” Every safe decision had felt reasonable — and left him exactly where he was.

The next train was in 23 minutes.

Daniel opened his laptop and worked on a proposal he’d been saving “for later.” He sent it before the screen could convince him not to.

By the time the train arrived, the email was gone. No undo. No second thoughts.

That afternoon, his manager asked to talk. No small talk. Straight to the point.

— “Why didn’t you bring this earlier?”

Daniel didn’t have a good answer.
Only an honest one.

A week later, he was assigned to a pilot project — temporary, uncertain, uncomfortable.

He missed more trains after that. Later nights. Earlier mornings.

Six months on, he stood on the same platform. Same smell. Same noise.

So, if I track all expenses on this card, I would be tracking restaurant expenses that would not be there if I didn't have the card. I can eat out just because I have free money hanging there and even pay for somebody.

If I don't track - then I would miss some expenses that I would have to make anyways (coffee beans).

She was so beautiful I'd go eat there almost every day to see her. And I'd always give her generous tips, just to see her smile. At some point I suggested she gives me her number so I can tip her directly to not raise suspicions, and she accepted. That became my happy routine, eating there and tipping her. She was young, attractive and out of my league, but i didn't care, that small interaction was enough.

One day she let me know she was quitting because she finished her studies. I was sad and told her I'd miss tipping her for her perfect service, and she laughed and said her too. I didn't want to be pushy, so I just said if she ever needs anything at all she can contact me, and she thanked me.

I was almost resigned, but she actually ended up texting me. She told me she was moving and asked if I could help her since I have a car. I immediately said yes and drove over. I insisted on doing all the lifting myself, which was ironic because I'm out of shape while she's a gym girl. When I was done she thanked me, and I kept telling her it was my pleasure.

A week passed and I wanted an excuse to interact with her, but I didn't know what to say. So I did the one thing I knew, I sent her a tip. An hour later she texted me asking me why I sent her money, and I made a cringe joke about reminiscing the good old times. She didn't answer for some time, then said ""sorry but I'm not looking for anything"". 

I panicked and apologized, making it clear that I didn't expect anything from her. She reiterated her question, demanding I be honest. So I said the truth, that I just like being useful to her in any way I can, no strings attached. She said ""kinda weird but ok. you can do my dishes if you want, that would be useful""

I made sure she meant it, and then I rushed to her place. She was surprised I showed up, then pointed at the pile of dishes and said ""knock yourself out"". 
I washed everything throughly, and I cleaned the stove and counters too. When I was done I thanked her profusely and sent her another tip. She looked genuinely confused and asked ""you're really paying me to do my chores?"". I nodded and said she deserves it. She answered playfully  ""good to know"", and I left. 

A couple days later she texted me ""still wanna be useful?"" I jumped and said yes. She said she needed me to pick up a package. I immediately drove there and brought it to her place. She took it and warned me that she orders often, and said she hopes I'm ready to be her delivery boy. I played along with the joke, only I was serious.  She was about to close the door, but I think she felt bad about just shooing me away, so she said ""there's more dishes if you want"". I said yes please, and got to work. When I was done I thanked her and tipped her. She joked that all men should be like me, and said she could get used to this.

So it kept going like that. Every now and then she'd text me for chores, errands, random tasks, and each time id pay her for the privilege. She started sending me grocery lists too, which id also cover. 

One day as I was leaving her place, I decided to say something I'd been thinking about. I hesitated for a second, and took a deep breath. I told her that whenever she wants money for anything she can just ask me, as it makes me happy sending her. I was nervously waiting for her reaction, and she just said like ""i'll keep that in mind"".

Not long after, she texted me that she was going out with friends and asked if I could send her 30$. I instantly did, and she thanked me. I was happy and hopeful, but after that she didn't ask me again, which was a bummer. I figured she was uncomfortable with it, so I kept insisting that she could really ask me anytime and anything, almost begging her. So eventually she went along with it. She started asking money for restaurants, ubers, shopping, random stuff. I gladly obliged every time, grateful for the opportunity. The requests became more frequent, and I started looking forward to them. The amounts also grew as she got more comfortable.

Long story short, Im basically covering all her every day expenses now. Either I wire her the amount, or she sends me a link for something she wants, like shoes or a bag, and asks me to buy it for her directly (something about taxes). On top of that she outsourced all her housework to me, so now almost every weekend she calls me over. I drop by with coffee or whatever she asked me to bring, and then she has me cleaning her place top to bottom (kitchen, bathroom, floors) while she relaxes. 

I've never made a move on her or done anything inappropriate, I just do what she says and thank her. As a result I think she feels comfortable around me, even hanging around in comfy clothes, like short shorts and a tank top. And I never say no to her, or even try to negotiate, no matter the inconvenience. Whatever she asks I just make it happen. That led to her gradually becoming more assertive and ""straight to the point"", especially since she realized formalities weren't required [(here's an extract to illustrate)](https://i.ibb.co/B2VjhDCz/untitled.png)

So that's my life now. I go to work, I spend my money on her, and I spend my free time serving her and running her errands. Last time, she was lounging in bed while I was mopping, and I was unusually irritated. Not by her, but because I slept poorly that day. When I was finally done and ready to leave, she looked up from her laptop and said ""do the baseboards too"" then went back to her show. When I heard that, a wave of frustration ran through me. I was tired, sweaty, and I wanted to throw the cleaning supplies and go home. And then it hit me : why am I, a grown man, getting ordered around like a maid by a girl barely out of college?

But then I saw how comfortable she was in her bed, and I remembered this was her rest day after a probably exhausting week between work and the gym. My eyes lingered on how effortlessly stunning she looked in her home clothes, and I imagined this beautiful girl having to deal with such menial tasks. There was no way. So I sucked it up, got on my knees, and I started scrubbing the baseboard.",7,1766227382.0,paypigsupportgroup,2,1.0,False
1prbjcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawfirms/comments/1prbjcl/spacesaving_solutions_for_small_homes/,Space-Saving Solutions for Small Homes,"Living in a small home doesn’t mean you have to compromise on comfort, style, or functionality. With rapid urbanization and rising property costs, compact living spaces have become the norm in many cities. Whether you live in a studio apartment, a compact 1BHK, or a small independent house, smart space-saving solutions can help you maximize every square foot. Thoughtful planning, [multifunctional furniture](https://srusticonstructions.in), and clever design strategies can transform even the smallest home into a spacious, organized, and aesthetically pleasing living environment.

This comprehensive guide explores practical and creative space-saving solutions for small homes, helping you make the most of your available space without sacrificing design or convenience.

# 1. Understand Your Space Before You Design

Before implementing any space-saving solution, it’s essential to understand how your space is currently used. Many small homes feel cramped not because of size, but because of poor layout and unnecessary clutter.

# Key steps:

* Analyze how each room is used daily
* Identify unused or underutilized areas
* Declutter items you no longer need
* Prioritize functions over decorative excess

A clear understanding of your lifestyle and needs will help you choose the right solutions rather than overcrowding your home with furniture or storage units.

# 2. Multifunctional Furniture: The Ultimate Space Saver

Multifunctional furniture is a cornerstone of[ small-home design.](https://srusticonstructions.in) These pieces serve more than one purpose, reducing the need for additional furniture.

# Popular multifunctional furniture ideas:

# Sofa Beds

Perfect for living rooms that double as guest rooms. During the day, it functions as seating; at night, it transforms into a bed.

# Storage Beds

Beds with built-in drawers or hydraulic storage underneath are ideal for storing bedding, seasonal clothing, or luggage.

# Foldable Dining Tables

Wall-mounted or extendable dining tables can be folded away when not in use, freeing up valuable floor space.

# Ottomans with Storage

These can be used as seating, footrests, or even coffee tables while offering hidden storage.

# Murphy Beds (Wall Beds)

Murphy beds fold vertically into the wall, allowing a bedroom to convert into a workspace or living area during the day.

# 3. Smart Storage Solutions for Every Room

Efficient storage is the backbone of a space-saving home. The goal is to store more while occupying less visible space.

# Vertical Storage

Use the height of your walls instead of spreading storage horizontally.

* Tall cabinets reaching the ceiling
* Wall-mounted shelves
* Hanging organizers

# Underutilized Areas

Make use of spaces that are often ignored:

* Under the bed
* Under staircases
* Above doors and windows
* Corners of rooms

# Built-In Storage

Custom-built storage units blend seamlessly into the architecture and save space compared to freestanding furniture.

* Built-in wardrobes
* Window seats with storage
* TV units with concealed cabinets

# 4. Modular Kitchens for Compact Homes

The kitchen is often one of the most challenging areas in a small home. Modular kitchen designs offer efficient layouts and smart storage solutions.

# Space-saving kitchen ideas:

* Pull-out pantry units
* Corner carousels for cabinets
* Vertical storage for trays and cutting boards
* Wall-mounted racks for utensils
* Slim appliances designed for small kitchens

Choosing light-colored cabinets and glossy finishes can also make the kitchen feel more open and spacious.

# 5. Foldable and Stackable Furniture

Furniture that can be folded, stacked, or nested is ideal for homes with limited space.

# Examples include:

* Folding chairs stored behind doors
* Stackable stools
* Nesting tables that can be separated or combined
* Foldable study desks

These pieces can be brought out only when needed, helping maintain a clutter-free environment.

# 6. Sliding Doors Instead of Swing Doors

Traditional swing doors require clearance space, which can be a problem in compact homes. Sliding doors are a smart alternative.

# Benefits of sliding doors:

* Save floor space
* Improve room flow
* Enhance modern aesthetics
* Suitable for wardrobes, bathrooms, kitchens, and balconies

Pocket doors, which slide into the wall, are even more effective for tight spaces.

# 7. Mirrors and Lighting to Create an Illusion of Space

Visual tricks play a significant role in making small homes appear larger.

# Mirrors

* Large mirrors reflect light and create depth
* Mirrored wardrobe shutters enhance openness
* Strategically placed mirrors can double the perceived size of a room

# Lighting

* Use layered lighting (ambient, task, and accent lighting)
* Install wall-mounted lights instead of floor lamps
* Choose warm yet bright lighting to avoid dark corners

Good lighting combined with mirrors can dramatically transform the feel of a compact space.

# 8. Open Layouts and Minimal Partitions

Open-plan layouts reduce visual barriers and improve airflow and natural light.

# How to define spaces without walls:

* Use rugs to define zones
* Different ceiling treatments
* Open shelving as room dividers
* Glass partitions instead of solid walls

This approach maintains functionality while keeping the home visually open.

# 9. Smart Bedroom Solutions for Small Spaces

Bedrooms in small homes should feel cozy yet uncluttered.

# Space-saving bedroom ideas:

* Wall-mounted bedside tables
* Floating shelves instead of bulky wardrobes
* Headboards with built-in storage
* Loft beds for kids’ rooms with study or play areas underneath

Choosing lighter colors and minimal furniture helps maintain a calm and spacious ambiance.

# 10. Compact Home Office Ideas

With remote work becoming common, creating a home office in a small home is often necessary.

# Space-efficient work-from-home solutions:

* Wall-mounted desks
* Fold-down study tables
* Use corners for workstations
* Convert wardrobes into hidden office spaces

A well-designed compact workspace can boost productivity without taking over your home.

# 11. Bathroom Space-Saving Tips

Bathrooms are typically the smallest rooms in a home, making efficient design crucial.

# Smart bathroom solutions:

* Wall-mounted toilets and sinks
* Recessed shelves and niches
* Over-the-toilet storage cabinets
* Sliding shower partitions

Opt for lighter tiles and large-format designs to make bathrooms appear more spacious.

# 12. Decluttering and Organization Habits

Even the best space-saving solutions won’t work if clutter accumulates.

# Simple habits to adopt:

* Follow the “one in, one out” rule
* Regularly review and donate unused items
* Use organizers for drawers and cupboards
* Keep surfaces as clear as possible

An organized home always feels larger and more welcoming.

# 13. Color Schemes and Material Choices

Colors and materials significantly influence how spacious a home feels.

# Best practices:

* Use light and neutral colors
* Limit the number of color tones
* Choose reflective surfaces like glass, mirrors, and glossy laminates
* Maintain consistency across rooms

Avoid heavy patterns and overly dark shades in small spaces.

# 14. Technology and Smart Home Solutions

Modern technology offers innovative ways to save space.

# Examples:

* Smart TVs mounted on walls
* Wireless charging stations
* Compact smart appliances
* Voice-controlled lighting and devices

These solutions reduce physical clutter while enhancing convenience.

# 15. Custom Interior Design: A Long-Term Investment

Custom-designed interiors tailored to your space and lifestyle provide the best results for small homes. Professional interior designers can help:

* Optimize layouts
* Design custom storage
* Select suitable materials
* Balance aesthetics and functionality

While custom solutions may involve a higher initial investment, they offer long-term comfort, efficiency, and value.

# Conclusion

Small homes can be stylish, comfortable, and highly functional with the right space-saving strategies. From multifunctional furniture and smart storage to thoughtful layouts and clever design tricks, every element plays a role in maximizing space. The key is to focus on quality over quantity, prioritize functionality, and maintain organization.

By implementing these space-saving solutions, you can transform your compact home into a well-designed sanctuary that feels open, efficient, and truly livable",2,1766227314.0,lawfirms,0,1.0,False
1prbikd,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1prbikd/i_did_a_thing_so_now_i_need_your_help/,"I did a thing, so now I need your help 😬","Hello fellow espresso enthusiasts! 

TL;DR: Former (current) BDB + Unibasket user needs advice from Flair 58 users for his new toy 🙏🏼

A bit of background: I am in the hobby for a few years at this point, and have been enjoying espresso, as well as extended ratios like turbo and soup. (I also have a Hario Switch and use that for ~20% of my coffee consumption, but that’s for another sub😁) I have a BDB + Weber Unibasket + Mazzer Philos setup and have been loving the flavor separation and clarity this setup has been giving me, without compromising on the body. I almost always drink light-roasted beans (mainly filter roasts even if both options are available) and really enjoy them. My experience is that the Unibasket plays a huge part in that. For a long while, I have been wanting to experiment with pressure profiling, especially a lever machine to have full immediate control. I know (and previously did) the slayer mod on my BDB, but I didn’t find it quite as precise as I want because the rotation range on the hot water knob was so small. Also, I don’t yet have a gooseneck kettle, so I’ve been using the BDB + its milk jug as a glorified kettle for my pourovers. As a result, I’ve been eyeing Flair for a while now, but couldn’t justify getting it at retail price. 

I have just come across a second hand Flair 58 that’s new in box (never even assembled) for 400€ and pulled the trigger, along with a brand new Chiato FlowPlay gooseneck kettle for 50€. 

Now I’m curious to see what I should expect, prepare for, know, etc. in this switch 😁 Can I use the Unibasket with the Flair portafilter? If not, do you know a budget one that fits, that I can get in EU? I really want to make the Unibasket work with my Flair because (in my experience), it elevates light roasts so much compared to a low-extraction basket, which I believe Flair 58 comes with as standard. Will temperature consistency be something I need to manage? Any other quirks or tips for a new Flair user mainly drinking light roasts and longer ratios?

Thank you in advance for all your suggestions! 🙏🏼",1,1766227230.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**

€2000-3000, It can go over 3000 but preferrably not much over.

* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**

Yes.

* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**

Performance is the most important, its for gaming mostly. Also battery life doesnt really matter. I've always used my laptops with chargers. 

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**

The bulkier the better, that usually means better cooling. My first laptop was huge, it could have been considered a weapon in some countries, loved that thing. 

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**

I would love to have a 18 Inch or 17 inch screen. But my research shows 16 and smaller is the new trend, and bigger screens tend to increase the price by a lot. But I am not against going to 16, I can get used to it. 

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run**

Gaming mostly. But heres a few upcoming games I want to play. Resident Evil Requim, Blood of the Dawnwalker, Halo Campaign Evolved. 

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**

Here's a few game a I want to play in good performance:  Stalker 2, Indiana jones the great circle, Hell is Us. Also I do a bit of VR gaming with my quest 3. So I've been playing some games on steam wirelessly, Want to increase that performance too.   
FPS goal is like 60, don't really need more than that myself. 

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**

Good keyboard is great, Can't really be too noisy as our home has paper thin doors. 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

So my previous laptop was ASUS ROG Strix SCAR 17 G733Q, but I broke it by pouring coffee on it unfortunately.   
I am open for any brand.

# Day 6 – Deurali → Machhapuchhre Base Camp → Annapurna Base Camp

>**Altitude:** 4,130 m

>**Distance:** \~7 km

>**Trek Time:** \~4.5 hours | 6:30 → 11:00

Steep ascent till MBC and after that gradual but slow walk due to altitude. ABC opens up like a massive amphitheatre. Sun disappears after 2 pm and it gets colder quickly, so you must arrive early for better experience. Luckily when I reached the ABC, there were no clouds.

**Highlights:**

* Close-up Machhapuchhre view at MBC
* Insane 360° Annapurna ranges view
* One of the most magical sunset
* Freezing, but unforgettable night
* Perfect place for Stargazers

**Expenses:**

>Stay (Annapurna Guest House): **NPR 250**

>WiFi: **NPR 250**

>Tea + Lunch + Dinner: **NPR 2,800**

>Day Total: **NPR 3,300**

# Day 7 – ABC → Lower Sinuwa

>**Distance:** \~19 km

>**Trek Time:** \~8.5 hours | 7:30 → 16:00

Longest descent day. Knees take a serious hit.

**Highlights:**

* Changing landscapes from snow to forest.
* Take this day slowly

**Expenses:**

>Lunch Tea: **NPR 350**

>Stay (Kalpana Guest House) + Food: **NPR 1,400**

# Day 8 – Lower Sinuwa → Jhinu → Landruk

>**Altitude:** 1,560 m

>**Distance:** \~12 km

>**Trek Time:** \~6.5 hours | 8:00 → 10:30 (Hot Spring), 11:30 → 14:30

Very steep climb from Sinuwa to Chhomrong then very steep decent to Jhinu.

Make sure you get the permit stamped again at Chhomrong checkpost (this is the third and last stamp).

Hot spring is a must at Jhinu after days of cold trekking. You can leave your bag at any lodge in Jhinu, but I took my bag with me.

After you cross the long suspension bridge, you will officially leave the ABC trek trail and can end trek here. You can get the shared jeep to Pokhara here. The cost of the Jeep is around **NPR 6000** and it will be shared between the people. If you are 6 people then each will pay 1000.

Note that jeep will only drop you to Hari Chowk. You will have to pay extra to go to lakeside or just do a Indrive.

If you wanna go to Mardi Himal, then right after crossing the bridge, you need to go left and go down and keep following the trail. You will cross a small bridge after a 30-40 min hike. This trail is a little tricky to find and can be missed easily because it's not very common amongst trekkers but mostly used by locals. After ABC, I was the only one on this trail that day.

**Highlights:**

* Natural hot springs
* Gurung village stay
* Very good view of Annapurna South and valley of ABC route from Landhruk
* You can see Gandhruk from Ladhruk

**Expenses:**

>Hot Spring entry ticket: **NPR 200**

>Tea: **NPR 300**

>Stay + Food: **NPR 2,150**

>Day Total: **NPR 2,650**

>**Altitude:** 2,950 m

>**Distance:** \~10 km

>\*\*Trek Time: \~\*\*5.5 hours | 9:30 → 14:45

Very steep continuous climb. Most tiring trail of the entrire trek. Dense forest, so you will hardly get any sunlight. Watch for the weather, it turned into whiteout conditions.

**Highlights:**

* Quiet trail compared to ABC
* Deep forest trekking
* Whiteout, sweating, no sunlight. Chances of hyperthermia.

**Expenses:**

>Stay (Stupa Hotel & Restaurant) + meals: **NPR 2,600**

>Day Total: **NPR 2,600**

# DAY 10 – Low Camp → High Camp → Mardi Base Camp → High Camp

>**Altitude:** 3,580 m (High Camp) | 4,500 m (Base Camp)

>**Distance:** \~5 km (High Camp) + 10 km (Base Camp & return)

>**Trek Time:** 9 hours

>\- Base Camp: \~3.5 hours | 12:00 → 15:30

>\- Return: \~2 hours | 16:00 → 18:45

Low Camp to High Camp is a beautiful trail. Once you leave the forest you, one of the most beautiful view opens up of Annapurna South, Macchapuchhre and many other small mountain peaks with river of clouds in the right. It is one of the most beautiful ridge walk from Badal Danda to High Camp and it gets even better after base camp. Some sections are tricky and very narrow on the ridge towards the Upper View Point.

**Highlights:**

* Sunset from Upper View Point is magical
* Challenging and very dangerous descent after sunset
* I was the only one to go to base camp, so the whole trail was mine
* Fishtail guest house was one of the best stay of my entire trek. It had comfotable modern beds.

# Day 11 – High Camp → Sidhing → Pokhara

>**Distance:** \~12 km (Trek) + \~32 km (Jeep)

>**Trek Time:** \~4 hours | 10:00 → 14:30

Steep descent through forest and villages to Sidhing, then jeep back to Pokhara. Since this was not the season for Mardi Himal. It was hard to get a shared jeep. Full jeep would cost you **NPR 6000**. Luckily after waiting for 45 min, two people decended and I shared the jeep with them.

**Highlights:**

* One of the wildest descents in Annapurna region
* Jeep will only take you to Hari Chowk. You need to pay extra for lakeside or get another taxi / bus

* My cost didn't include arriving in Kathmandu. This will change depending on the country you are flying from.
* Cost is in Nepali Currency.

# Challenges & Problems

* Overall trek is easy, but Chhomrong to Sinuwa section is brutal.
* My rucksack was 16 L without water. I was carrying 3 L of water with me. So it was more tiring for my shoulders & back.
* Brought too many underwears. There was enough time & sunlight to wash and dry.
* Landruk to Low Camp was one of the hardest day because the trail was only up. Around 12 pm fog started forming. I was already sweating and started catching cold.
* When you share room, be careful about your stuffs. Someone accidently took my towel.
* I had to sleep in a wardrobe sized room at Deurali because I didn't prebook
* I didn't drop my rucksack at Jhinu before going to hotspring. While coming back I sweat again so bath was for nothing lol.
* Getting shared taxi from Sidhing is hard.

# Important Information & Suggestions

* You can get your permit from Immigration Office in Pokhara. You need two passport size photos.
* Get a NTC Sim not Ncell. You will only get network in NTC at most of the places in mountains.
* Getting rooms is hard in peak season, so try to prebook. I will share the contact numbers of all the lodges.
* Keep your backpack light.
* Leave as early as you can to reach the destination early. This way you will have more chances to get the room.
* Room charges are per person not per room.
* Always try to negotiate for rooms and services. They will lower the price.
* Don't forget bring Sleeping Bag in Novemeber season. It gets freezing cold at ABC. -10 my time.
* You can find photos and video on the instagram page ankit\_saiyan. I am not able to share here.

Nepal is a beautiful country. I would suggest everyone to go to Nepal at least once and do this trek. The whole ABC trail is very lively and fun and it gets better as you progress.",7,1766226438.0,SoloTravel_India,3,1.0,False
