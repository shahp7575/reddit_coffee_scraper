the reason why i never truly thought it could be LI, because i rarely ever get diarrhea. i did notice it‚Äôs a lot more mushy (sorry tmi) than it should be, but i never had diarrhea after lactose products. i started eating lactose free stuff like two and a half weeks ago, and my bowel movements were so much better/healthier until yesterday.

obviously i‚Äôm not trying to get diagnosed here, i went to my GP doctor with these problems because the gassiness and nausea was starting to be too much, and she did say it‚Äôs probably LI. however, yesterday i had my dinner made with lactose free milk and my stomach instantly started hurting and had to go (still not diarrhea, but closer lol), and this morning the same happened after coffee, and i also had the stomach burn after breakfast and lunch as well. is it possible to still react even if it‚Äôs lactose free? or maybe it‚Äôs that specific brand? i even thought of gluten, because except for coffee all the meals contained gluten. i‚Äôm kind of lost what i should do. 

testing for these is pretty expensive in my country, that‚Äôs why i wanted to figure it out for myself for now. thanks for the help! 21/F btw.",2,1740312258.0,lactoseintolerant,0,1.0,False

I first experienced symptoms about 20 years ago, breaking out in hives while exercising. It got quite severe, and to a point in grad school where even walking to class would have my eyes swollen and body covered in hives. Unfortunately I had to drop out. I have seen many doctors who simply advised a ""take OTC antihistimes and pray"" approach. I'm hoping that some of the solutions here will be more effective. I just want to lead a ""normal"" life of going to the gym and being intimate without sever symptoms and suffering. Any advice is appreciated.

Here's a 1-2 week plan I've come up with using GPT:

# üìå Phase 1: Identify & Track Patterns (Week 1-2)

# üéØ Goals:

‚úî Log symptoms, identify triggers, and start immediate relief strategies.

‚úî Begin **low-histamine diet** and **introduce priority supplements**.

# ‚úÖ Daily Symptom Tracking

üìå **Use Notion, Everyday, or Grit App**

* Log **when symptoms appear** (time, activity, stress level, temperature).
* Track **severity** (mild, moderate, severe).
* Identify patterns related to **food, environment, or emotions**.

# ‚úÖ Diet Adjustments: Low-Histamine Start

**‚úî Allowed Foods (Safe, Low-Histamine, Anti-Inflammatory):**

* **Fats & Oils:** **Olive oil, ghee, flaxseed oil** (Avoid vegetable oils).
* **Herbs & Spices:** **Basil, oregano, thyme, ginger, turmeric** (Avoid fermented spices).

**üö´ Avoid These High-Histamine Foods:**

* **Aged, Fermented, & Cured Foods** (cheese, vinegar, soy sauce, kombucha).
* **Coconut-Based Foods** (milk, oil, flour).
* **Caffeinated & Alcoholic Drinks** (coffee, black tea, wine, beer).
* **Citrus Fruits** (oranges, lemons, limes, pineapples, strawberries).
* **Nightshades** (tomatoes, eggplants, potatoes, peppers).
* **Nuts & Legumes** (walnuts, cashews, peanuts, chickpeas, soy).

# ‚úÖ Priority Supplements (Start Now)

**1Ô∏è‚É£ DAO Enzyme (Histamine Block)** ‚Äì **Before meals** to prevent food-triggered symptoms.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Quercetin & Bromelain** ‚Äì **Natural antihistamine** (500mg **2x daily**).

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Vitamin C (Sodium Ascorbate or Ester-C)** ‚Äì **Breaks down histamine** (500-1000mg **2x daily**).

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Choline (Alpha-GPC or CDP-Choline)** ‚Äì **Supports sweating** (300-600mg **AM**).

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Magnesium Glycinate** ‚Äì **Calms nervous system, improves relaxation** (200-400mg **nightly**).

# ‚úÖ Immediate Symptom Relief

‚úî **H1 Antihistamines (Allegra, Zyrtec)** ‚Äì For **immediate relief**.

‚úî **Cooling Lotions** (*Calamine, Aloe Vera, Menthol-based creams*).

1iw8f7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1iw8f7m/my_fallout_new_vegas_review_after_14_years/,My Fallout New Vegas Review after 14 years.,"Howdy all!

After 14 years since the release of Fallout New Vegas I would like to share my history as well as my most recent (and ONLY) proper play through of the game.

Straight off the bat I would like to say this is purely my own opinion/feelings towards the series. Reason for this post is to hopefully engage with other fans as well as creating a discussion of others points of view! so grab a coffee as this is going to be a long oneüòÅ

Quick brief history of my Fallout gaming is like most people getting hooked on FO3 as a kid - I was usually spending my time playing first person shooters but randomly bought the game in a sale and had no idea how much I would love it. Managed to complete the base game, add-ons plus 100% achievement's then the trailer came out for FNV - I was so happy knowing there was going to be another FO game after just acing 3. I got the game and started my official first play through, I just didn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked. I can remember seeing The Strip for the first time and feeling so disappointed at how small it was, and how everywhere else on the map was so dull and similar. I still continued the game not really as engaged as I should have been not knowing it had 4 different endings, which ads to my demise of positivity for it.

I can remember getting to the Hoover Dam battle having no ammo, aid or decent game saves to go back to, to try again (I know, rookie mistake). Unfortunately, this put me off New Vegas for the next 14 years. Many people say to me ""Why don't you just replay, and do it better?"" but I had next to zero motivation because of this.

FO4 was then released and instantly fell in love - also achieving 100% achievements.

As years passed I've seen so many videos and read so many posts about how New Vegas was everyone's favourite out of the series and I just couldn't see why?

Now in 2024 what recently gave me the motivation to give New Vegas a second attempt at a full playthrough was 3 things:

1. I've been collecting Fallout merchandise and collectables from 3 and 4 but not NV as I didn't know much about it to be adding props to my collection I know next to nothing about. 

2. Having achieved 100% on 3 and 4 is was very annoying to me that NV wasn't ü§£ 

3. (\*\*SPOLIER\*\*) With the release of the Fallout TV series, at the end you can see that the next series will include The Strip in NV. After seeing that I was determined to play NV again, properly, and properly understand it - so I understand the next season of Fallout.

\[To note - FO3/4 were played on Xbox, NV is on PC.\]

I've also read that NV is better played on a decent spec'd PC, which I have. NV came up in a sale on Steam with all the expansions so I knew this was my time to give it a good shot.

For one of the NV achievements is to complete the game on Hardcore mode which I remember as a kid thinking 'hell no! This is beyond me!' but doing the first few quests I realised this is how I was playing FO4 and some FO76 (that's a different storyüí§) so this time around I felt positive on this playthrough. I completed 1/4 of the story's on Hardcore mode and felt satisfied knowing I had surpassed my terrible first shot at the game so was now hopeful although I still wasn't enjoying it as much as I should 'should be' As I mentioned above there are 4 different endings to either choose from or re-do them for achievements. I had to load back and do it all again by choosing a different faction to side with each time. I didn't find the other 3/4 factions interesting at all and seen it more of a chore. Not sure if this is because I'm used to a single straight story game or the fact I had to basically go in reverse to go forward. I understand there are games out there that you have to do this with but it wasn't enjoyable for me.

Now that the base game was complete I now had to complete side missions and challenges to not only see the rest of what the game had to offer.

There wasn't too many things that stuck out to me whilst doing the expansions, challenges and the last of the side quests however this what I enjoyed:

* Out of all the expansions I liked 'The Divide'. The base game feels boring, dull, same like and not much sticks out at you apart from The Strip lights in the distance - which is a lovely view but that's about it. Jumping into The Divide was like heading back into a wasteland with derelict buildings and cool challenges for example to take out all warheads along with some added weapons and loot.
* Stumbling across Vault 22 was brilliant. Literally in the middle of a sandy hill there is a vault completely overgrown with vegetation which was more of a surprise as you have read my opinion on how I feel the game looked!
* I've always enjoyed the side quests on collecting things. For NV it was the snow globes and the star bottle caps which made me continue to enjoy looting for things and coming across more goodies. (I was disappointed that to have the snow globes on show you would have to sell them to a person before killing Mr House (if that's the route you took) for them to then be put on show on a shelf in the presidential suite. Would have preferred to have a choice weather to sell or to actually store them yourself, even if you had to purchase a stand or something through the terminal in the suite.)
* As any new game there are new weapons, armour etc. So going from 3 to NV there was only a couple of guns/armour that seemed decent enough for me to get: Enclave Remnants power armour is an example as this was epic.

To conclude:

* I think my expectation for another Fallout 3 like game was over-expected due to my previous excitement with #3 which already filled me with negativity when playing.
* My first and failed playthrough also hindered my motivation to replay.
* Missing out NV then acing #4 then back to NV definitely didn't help things. This was like only playing PS2 then seeing Xbox 360 gameplay then back to PS2 - it's just not the same anymore.
* As you have read, I was possibly too engrossed in getting all achievements for the game rather than taking my time and enjoying it for what it really is.

If you have made it this far I appreciate your time for reading! I recently had a conversation with friends about this very subject and they also believe NV is one of the greatest and tried to explain why but just couldn't see it! I would love to read other options on this and have a conversation - not to change my mind because you can change the way you think, not how you feel.

Hope this has been interesting! Thank you, James.",1,1740311297.0,Fallout,1,1.0,False
1iw8f04,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iw8f04,A solo trip to Malaysia,"GENERAL INFO:


Airfare: Cebpac roundtrip PHP11k (with check-in and seats)


Hotel: Big M Hotel PHP 6k (5 nights. Located a few feet from MRT, Merdeka Square, and lots of restaurants!)


Transpo: Grab (relatively affordable around KLCC, about ~PHP150/trip)


Others: eSIM (PHP 300) and travel insurance from Standard (PHP ~500)


Tours: All availed from Klook (as well as my car service to-and-from KLIA2). Total cost is about PHP~10k but I got some vouchers from my company so it was 70% off for me.


Camera: I use a 35mm film SLR camera for my trip (Olympus OM-1) and my films were Hitchcock 500T and Kodak Ultramax 400. Some of the pictures are direct from camera, some are touched up using Snapseed.



ITINERARY:


Day 1: Arrived 1am and rested until 10am in my hotel. Went out to lunch for Indian food at Betel Leaf (highly recommend!) and some Zeus coffee. Went on a half-day city tour from Klook. After, ate some Damascus shawarma, some Turkish desserts from Kunafa Crisp, and Wagyu skewers from Donki. 


Day 2: Whole day mostly taken up by the Batu Caves and Genting Highlands tour. Managed to eat in Madam Kwan's for lunch (cendol, nasi lemak beef rendang, and curry chicken). There was a Hindu festival in the Batu Caves so we weren't able to go up the stairs and see the cave. There were so many people as well but it was an experience to see a lot of Indian people celebrating their culture. After the tour, I went to Jalan Alor street for a quick bite and tour.


Day 3: Went on the Putrajaya tour with cruise in the morning. In the afternoon, spent it in Chinatown and Central market and the River of Life. Managed to see some street art and do some souvenir shopping. One thing that stood out to me was that area has a lot of personality, which is much more enjoyable than just seeing tall buildings. 


Day 4: Most of it spent in my day tour to Melaka. Great city with a lot to offer in terms of history for Malaysia. Went to the Orangutan House (highly recommend for people who enjoy seeing art!) and bought a t-shirt. Enjoyed going to the shops in their own Chinatown and looking at vintage goods. In the evening, I went to the TRX Exchange mall and rooftop park.


Day 5: Thean Hou Temple, KLCC Park, Bank Negara Museum, and some shopping in Donki. Did some last minute souvenir grabs and packed my bags. Flight was 12am and headed back to the airport at around 8pm (early but there was heavy traffic that day so it was worth it!).


OVERALL: Great, casual trip. Wish I could've had time to visit Penang and Langkawi but I guess I'll save that for next time. This travel was a lot easier for me because I booked a lot of tours rather than doing DIY like my previous travels. 


Malaysia is a very diverse country with a lot to offer. Their cuisine are excellent and abundant in flavors and aroma. Kuala Lumpur in particular have a lot of street art and architecture to marvel at. Definitely a must-visit in SEA! ",26,1740311274.0,phtravel,6,1.0,False

If you missed it, Trump pulled the lever on Feb 1st under that IEEPA national emergency thing‚Äî25% tariffs on most imports from Canada and Mexico (10% on Canadian energy), plus a 10% bump on China. Why? Fentanyl deaths (75k+ Americans yearly) and illegal immigration (10M+ attempts under Biden, per Trump). He‚Äôs aiming these at Mexico‚Äôs cartels, Canada‚Äôs growing fentanyl scene, and China‚Äôs precursor chemical pipeline. X‚Äôs been buzzing since the White House confirmed it‚Äîsome call it genius, others a grocery bill death sentence. Buckle up, because the fallout‚Äôs just starting.

**Canada‚Äôs Not Here to Play**

Trudeau‚Äôs squad isn‚Äôt sipping Tim Hortons and shrugging this off. As of today, Feb 23rd, Canada‚Äôs rolling out *25% retaliatory tariffs* on $106 billion of U.S. goods‚Äîbeer, ketchup, machinery, the works. X posts are screaming about Molson and Labatt prices jumping stateside, and oil futures are up 7% since the 10% energy tariff hit. Gas stations near me are already nudging prices up‚Äîsaw $3.85/gallon this morning, up 10 cents from last week. Canada‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúFentanyl? Us? That‚Äôs a you problem‚Äù‚Äîthey claim under 1% of U.S. supply comes through them. True or not, this tit-for-tat‚Äôs heating up fast.

**Mexico‚Äôs Stirring the Pot**

Mexico‚Äôs keeping it low-key but deadly. They‚Äôre eyeing tariffs on U.S. corn and pork‚Äîstuff that‚Äôll sting red-state farmers who backed Trump. Cartels? Untouched so far‚Äîtariffs don‚Äôt hit black markets, duh. Guac‚Äôs already up 20% at my Chipotle, and X‚Äôs got memes of Trump holding an avocado like it‚Äôs a hostage. Sheinbaum‚Äôs pushing ‚Äútalks, not tariffs,‚Äù but with 25% on their exports, they‚Äôre not exactly feeling chatty. This could get uglier.

**China‚Äôs Playing Chess**

China‚Äôs 10% tariff bump is stacking on old wounds, and they‚Äôre eerily quiet. State media‚Äôs tossing ‚ÄúU.S. bully‚Äù shade, but X diggers found shipping logs‚Äîprecursor chemicals are already rerouting to Mexico like it‚Äôs a fentanyl relay race. Trump wants them to choke the supply, but Beijing‚Äôs just shifting pawns. Retaliation‚Äôs brewing‚Äîsoybeans or rare earths could be next. Sneaky, right?

**$TARIFF‚Äôs Holding the Line**

Meanwhile, $TARIFF‚Äîthe crypto tied to Trump‚Äôs tariff crusade‚Äîis eating this chaos up. Trading‚Äôs spiked 400% since Feb 1st (check [https://shorturl.at/tsQKN](https://shorturl.at/tsQKN)), and the ‚ÄúOperation Flywheel‚Äù staking‚Äôs got HODLers locked in. It‚Äôs not just a coin‚Äîit‚Äôs a bet on Trump‚Äôs America-first flex: kill the $1T trade deficit, secure borders, crush drug trafficking. X‚Äôs split‚Äîhalf see it as a patriot pump, half as a meme coin on steroids. I‚Äôm eyeing [https://shorturl.at/5Zqa6](https://shorturl.at/5Zqa6) to stake a few bucks‚Äîwhy not ride the hype?

**The Pain‚Äôs Real‚ÄîGas, Groceries, and More**

Here‚Äôs the kicker: this hits us *now*. Gas is creeping, coffee‚Äôs next (Mexico‚Äôs in the mix), and car parts from Canada/Mexico mean my mechanic‚Äôs quoting 15% more for a fix. Economists on X say inflation‚Äôs looming‚Äîmaybe 2-3% by summer if retaliation escalates. Trump‚Äôs banking on ‚Äúshort-term pain, long-term gain‚Äù‚Äîfactories coming back, jobs popping. But my wallet‚Äôs not feeling heroic yet.

**What‚Äôs Next?**

Trump‚Äôs doubling down‚ÄîX‚Äôd this morning, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll bend or break. America‚Äôs worth it.‚Äù If Canada, Mexico, or China crack on fentanyl/immigration, he wins big. If not, we‚Äôre in for a trade war shitshow. Tomorrow, I‚Äôll scope out how big biz (Walmart, Ford) is scrambling‚Äîspoiler: they‚Äôre not happy. What‚Äôs your call, Reddit?

If you‚Äôre in the middle of this nightmare, know that you *can* heal. I did.

**December 2023** ‚Äì It all started after i ate some fried egg rolls and after 1-2 hours I began experiencing severe acid reflux, nausea, and intense stomach pain and cramps. Over the next few weeks, i started getting full-blown gastritis attacks:

* Stabbing stomach pain
* Nausea and chills
* Extreme fatigue and brain fog
* Rapid heartbeat and anxiety
* Loss of appetite and weight loss

Doctors gave me PPIs, and other meds, but nothing truly worked. I still get pain at least 3-5 times a week.  
**January-March 2024 - Trying to change my diet**

Despite changing my diet i still get attacks at least once a week, i'm starting to lose hope until i read some posts realizing healing may take a long time and decided to watch and monitor my self, what i eat, what are my triggers and when does it trigger. 

**April 2024 ‚Äì Diet & Lifestyle Changes Begin**  
I decided to take matters into my own hands and heal through diet. I committed to a strict *anti-inflammatory diet* for 15 weeks, then slowly reintroduced foods. I still get gastritis attacks occasionally(every 1-3 months) and i only get attacks when i eat wrong.

**August 2024 - I had my worst gastritis attack**

Experienced my worst gastritis attack, i was in pain for 3 days. Realizing i made a mistake thinking i'm healed and started eating bad again. I had to go back to my diet and cut off bad foods my stomach entirely

# What Worked for Me

‚úÖ **Strict Diet (First 12 Weeks)**

* No gluten, no dairy, no processed food
* Ate only oatmeal, sweet potatoes, chickpeas, steamed veggies, and wheat bread.
* No caffeine or alcohol
* No nightshades (tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes)
* No oily foods

‚úÖ **Gradual Reintroduction (After 20 Weeks)**

* Slowly added back butter and parmesan cheese
* Introduced small amounts of fruit (bananas, apples, blueberries)
* Occasional cheat meals but kept my stress low
* Started eating foods with Vinegar

‚úÖ **Lifestyle Changes**

* No stress (seriously, stress makes everything worse)
* Focused on gut health (fermented foods, probiotics)



# Where I Am Now

Last time I had my *a* gastritis attack, it was August 2024. Today, I eat everything‚Äîspicy food, fried food, dairy, softdrinks, coffee‚Äî*zero* issues.

**Takeaway:** Healing takes patience. Diet is everything. Stress is just as important. If you stick to it, you *will* get better.

First things first: thank you. I sincerely thank all of you. You've been a supportive community. And I owe you Big Time!

Regardless, and like many of you, I'm still a struggling sufferer. Last night, I've partaken in the ostensible pugilism with muscle twitches that disrupted my sleep. I've had horrible nightmares. It got worse. I woke up like 20 times. So here my hell -- after months of betterment, of where I thought I was almost ""cured""-- started again.

Alas, here's my small retribution (a tribute or my ""2 cents"") to this sacred and suffering space. And negatory: I've not created an exhaustive list. Nor am I postulating an absolute, dare-I-say-it cardinal commandments that you have to follow ""or else""...

These are, however, merely suggestions.

You could think of it as an anecdotal technical diary, something with the potential to grow, some tapestry of advice in which you can partake in, or a space in the digital sphere of personal antidotes... if you got anything out of this, any remedial worth, then I'm happy.

Of course, you have to do some introspection. Are you're struggling with painsomnia? Schizophrenia? Perhaps benign muscle fasciculations (like I do)? It pays to know, all else being equal (or ceterus paribus) what's the cause of your insomnia. While for some of us it may anxiety, for others it may be an unholy combination.

A root-cause analysis should be -- and I stress! -- your first step to battling this heinous and cruel condition. And it follows necessarily that you need to do whatever you can, however it may be, to maximally curb this sanctimonious mist.

All in all, whatever your reasons might be, it doesn't matter. I'm sure you can find something you haven't tried, or a new miracle supplement that might just as well ""cure"" you -- who knows?!

So here are the basics, your ""starter pack"" Together with my diary (which I shall share shortly), I've boiled everything down into a shorter, cookie-cutter version of what you can follow to help you. So do take the time to read it if you feel like it. Hope it helps. Cheers!

**TL;DR...**

**The DOS**

* Artificial tears (not eye regular drops)
* Vaseline or other lotions to help moisturizing your skin. AKA Petrolium Jelly.
* Shaving your hair.
* Noise blockers\\ Hieros or Macks Earplugs.
* White noise -- Put it on loop.
* Eyemasks
* Light blocking curtains/Alternative: place chairs with stilts around your bed covered with blankets to block light
* Mattress.
* Enjoying life to the max
* Prayer -- Shouldn't necessarily be tied to religion.
* NSDR (Yoga Nidra) -- Kamini Dessai.
* Meditation -- Defusion/Zen. Not Vipassana or concentration.
* **Cosmic Surrendering (My personal method I'll share shortly)**
* Brainwave -- Anthony Sommers.
* Hypnosis -- Michael Sealy, Nicholas Wright, etc.
* Chanting -- Put on brainwave and sing a word, phrase or concept. (Will discuss transcendental meditation soon.)
* Cooling your forehead. (Place a frozen towel on your forehead to reduce racing thoughts.)
* Mindset (Embrace vulnerability. Hug a pillow or a toy for comfort!)

**Supplements/Nootropics**

* Milk Thistle
* Ashwagandha
* Vitamin b6, b12 combo
* Melatonin
* Magnesium (Glycinate, citrate or threonate)
* Lemon Balm
* Valerian root
* Lavender --
* N-Acetylcetine
* L-Theanine. Black tea is rich in theanine, but caffeine is its downside. Better to get theanine supplements.
* Inositol
* GABA
* Omega 3,6 oils. Get this in a supplement form.
* Apigenin -- Hack: Get crushed parsley. It contains lots of apigenin without your having to get it in supplement form.

**The DONTS:-**

* No Weightlifting (Avoid getting tagged by being Mr Strong.)
* No fighting (Don't get into physical or verbal confrontations.)
* No Caffeine (Avoid any and all caffeine. Coffee. Chocolate. And yes, even decaf!)
* No Smoking (A no-brainer!)
* No Alcohol (Having a tot can certainly help -- but it's double edged. Better to avoid!)

Compound/Augment: Start with one above for 2 weeks. Do you notice improvements? Keep going and/or add another.

Eliminate: If no improvements, scrap it. Eliminate only after some time (Will discuss later in the proto-doxical post).

If severe reactions, eliminate ASAP. DO not switch at this point.

To restate, don't think of this as a laundry list. I want this to be additive; not discrete. So instead of thinking of it as My way or the high way, caress this as a a study or pursuit if you will: an assembly of tools for your insomnia part of your problem, or something that could potentially mature into a corpus of tools, suggestions, and methods at your disposal.

And don't get me started on psychiatric meditations. While helpful, and I don't dispute them wholeheartedly, such medications aren't meant to be used long term. So logically I can't -- and wont' -- include them as a long-term solution. Instead, I offered distinct hypothesis based on actual science (something that ncbi or other studies have confirmed) which at least to some part, is deemed credible with confidence against a sugar pill (AKA placebo).",3,1740309958.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

Shadow of the Past

Hermione Granger sat at a small table in the corner of a cozy London caf√©, her fingers tapping nervously on the side of her coffee cup. She had always been sure of herself‚Äîconfident in her intellect, in her decisions. But as she waited for Draco Malfoy to arrive, the butterflies in her stomach were impossible to ignore. 

She had only called him out of necessity. She needed his expertise to crack the case that had been plaguing her for weeks. But as the minutes ticked by, her mind wandered. She hadn‚Äôt seen him in years‚Äîhadn‚Äôt wanted to, if she were being honest. Their brief, heated encounters during the final battle at Hogwarts had been buried beneath the weight of years spent raising children, working, and keeping up appearances in her failing marriage to Ron. Once, years ago at the 10th year anniversary ceremony for the Battle of Hogwarts, she saw Draco. He was with his fianc√©, Daphne, and slightly drunk off fire whisky. She didn‚Äôt get to talk to him, but she studied him from afar. Draco was no longer the same arrogant boy she remembered. He was older, quieter, and wore the burden of past mistakes on his shoulders. Hermione thought about how she, too, had changed‚Äîher once carefree smile now often replaced by a distant look, and the sparkle in her eyes dimmed by the routine of her life. Ron was unbearable to talk to most of the time, his jokes merely distractions.

A familiar voice interrupted her thoughts.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre early,‚Äù Draco said, sliding into the seat across from her with a half-smirk. His platinum blond hair was still neatly combed, and the tailored suit he wore exuded a quiet sophistication, but there was something different about him. Gone were the harsh edges of his youth; instead, there was a softness that reflected the toll of time. And he looked sober.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to waste any time,‚Äù Hermione replied, her voice steadier than she felt. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you understand.‚Äù

His smile faltered for a moment, and Hermione caught a brief flicker of something deeper in his eyes. Pain, perhaps. He was still recovering, she knew. The whispers about his past‚Äîabout his struggles with alcohol, with his marriage to Daphne‚Äîhad found their way to her ears. Yet, he was the one person who could help her with this case, the one person who knew the depths of the dark magic they were dealing with. It was rumored he had procured The Dagger of Ares and she needed it to move forward with this case. 

The conversation shifted quickly to business, and for a moment, it was easier to focus on the task at hand. They argued back and forth over where Draco might have put it. Hermione suspected he was enjoying dangling the location of the enchanted dagger, but for some reason she allowed the row to go on. Their minds were working in sync, but as always, there was an underlying tension‚Äîan unspoken energy between them that neither of them could ignore. 

As their disagreement grew more heated, they both stood up at once, moving toward the small lavatories in the back of the caf√©. Hermione‚Äôs mind was racing, her thoughts tumbling over each other like a waterfall. She splashed her face with cold water and dried it with a napkin. She didn‚Äôt notice Draco as he emerged from the men‚Äôs lavatory, his expression troubled, until they almost collided in the narrow hallway.

Their eyes met.

For a moment, neither of them moved. Hermione could hear her breath catch in her throat, and she felt the warmth of Draco‚Äôs body so close to hers. There was something unspoken between them, a dangerous current neither could deny. His gaze dropped to her lips, and for a heartbeat, she almost thought he might kiss her. But instead, they both stepped back, awkwardly fumbling for words.

‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù Draco began, his voice hoarse. ‚ÄúI should‚Ä¶ go back.‚Äù

Hermione nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. ‚ÄúYes, of course.‚Äù

But neither of them moved.

The tension hung in the air, thick and unrelenting. Hermione‚Äôs pulse raced, her mind screaming at her to get a grip, to stop this. But when Draco finally broke the silence with a quiet, ‚ÄúCome with me‚Ä¶Please,‚Äù she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to argue.",1,1740309771.0,harrypotterfanfiction,0,1.0,False

Back in high school, around sophomore year, I met one of my friends before they transitioned and as much as I do not like them, we‚Äôll call him H to keep his identity safe. This person has been friends with me throughout 10-12 grade a solid two years especially since we exchanged phone numbers. After senior year end term exams throughout the final week of high school, H and I would drive around in their car and get a bite to eat sometimes and I would give gas money in exchange for toting my butt around since I didn‚Äôt have a car myself at the time. After graduation, we even kept in touch and hung out at a local coffee bar not far from where we both lived. We were close for a good 2 and a half years. Though that would change about midway through 2024. 

I had heard that H was moving to Dallas to get an apartment with a few roommates and, naturally, I was happy for them to find their first place to move out to. I told H that I wished them luck in Dallas over Discord and that was the last that I heard from them.
About one and a half weeks later around April, I had heard that they came back. I texted H saying ‚Äúso how was Dallas?‚Äùand I didn‚Äôt get a single response or a reaction even. I started to suspect something and since I always gaslight myself just in case, I texted them again 4 days later saying ‚Äúwas it something I said?‚Äùand I couldn‚Äôt send the message since I was unfriended and blocked (since I wasn‚Äôt able to friend them back). This was strange to me that H would do this, so I went to the aforementioned coffee bar to talk and greet them for coming back properly. Though when I got there, they were acting a bit weird. They hardly looked at me and when they did, it was only for a brief second and they disregarded me soon after, and so did their friends at the table and I think they leeched off of H‚Äôs demeanor to me. I even offered homemade cake but none of them took it. I sat at the table for a good bit and ate my cake, calling them over after a short bit. I asked them if they had any sort of problem with me since they blocked me over Discord and they said they didn‚Äôt, which I didn‚Äôt believe at all. Without much else to say, they headed back to the table and I decided to go home early that day. Every few weeks, I would drop by the place since she worked there now and sneak in a ‚Äòsorry‚Äô, even though I didn‚Äôt even know what I was apologizing for, and she would return it with a ‚Äòmhm‚Äô or a roll of her eyes. I would try and talk to her genuinely many days a week across October 2024, but to no avail. Since then, I gave up since she didn‚Äôt want to cooperate.

I don‚Äôt get it. We were friends for years, shared secrets, hung out, had each other‚Äôs backs, paid for each others expenses when needed, and I supported their transition from male to female since they were my friend and me respecting individuality. AITA for not knowing what I did, if anything at all? I‚Äôve been really confused these past few months and I can‚Äôt help but wonder if it was any of my fault‚Ä¶",0,1740309589.0,AITAH,7,0.5,False

My first stop is a roaster and cafe called .refined in Hanoi. The arabicas I tried are not from Vietnam, but the robustas are from central Vietnam. 

I tried two arabicas, and these are honestly more dramatic than what I had at Glitch. The first is Fruit Storm as a pour over. Sweet melon, and an almost fruit punch quality. Super sweet. Truly an amazing cup. This is a blend of two Colombians special processed. The second is a Colombia Geisha natural processed with a cotton candy like sweetness up front and an earthy finish. Both pour overs were super clean and enjoyable. 

All of the robustas from specialty shops I‚Äôve seen so far seem to be named ‚ÄúFine Robusta‚Äù but the roasts are all unique. I chose the Vietnamese filter brew (Phin). This shop is using their own innovation that has aimed to improve the workflow. A medium dark roast that has burnt popcorn on the nose. The taste starts off very earthy and then moves to rich dark chocolate. As it cooled, I got more milky notes. 

The brand is about five years old. They have a similar sentiment as the central region that specialty coffee is still a new concept that is difficult for the locals to adopt. I‚Äôm sure in time they will. They recommended a place that specializes in robusta, so I‚Äôll try that next. Overall, I‚Äôm pretty impressed with .refined. ",1,1740309534.0,coffeerotation,0,1.0,False

1iw7yz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iw7yz9/the_deer_i_didnt_kill/,"""The Deer I Didn't Kill""","

It was past midnight when I was driving back from my business trip. I had been on the road for over six hours, and all I wanted was to be in my own bed. I still had about two more hours to go, but exhaustion was creeping in. The wipers barely kept up with the rain, and my headlights cut through the dense fog that curled over the empty highway like something alive.

Then I saw the sign‚Äîa side road cutting through the forest, promising to shave at least thirty minutes off my trip.

I didn‚Äôt think twice. I turned.

The road was narrow, empty, and eerily silent. Rain drummed against the hood, and the trees on either side seemed to lean in, watching me with unseen eyes. For a brief moment, I thought maybe this wasn‚Äôt the best idea, but it was too late to turn back.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

A deer. Standing in the middle of the road, motionless like a statue. Its antlers were massive, unnaturally twisted into strange shapes. Its eyes gleamed dully in the headlights, not with the usual reflection, but with something‚Ä¶ else.

I didn‚Äôt have time to brake.

The impact was brutal‚Äîthe deer rolled over my hood and landed somewhere in the ditch. My heart pounded, my breath came in ragged gasps.

I got out, even though every part of me screamed not to.

The deer lay on the side of the road, its body contorted at odd angles, its neck twisted unnaturally as if something had wrung it at the last moment. And then I noticed something else.

There was no blood.

None.

I shuddered. I needed to get out of there.


---

A few miles later, I came across a small town. A gas station, a bar, a few houses. The perfect place to stop for the night and gather my thoughts.

The bar was the only place still open. As I walked in, the conversation inside halted. Everyone turned to look at me like they could sense I didn‚Äôt belong.

I took a seat at the counter and ordered a coffee.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre far from the highway,‚Äù the bartender said, an older man with a wrinkled face. ‚ÄúNot many people take that road.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hit a deer,‚Äù I said, trying to sound casual. ‚ÄúFigured I shouldn‚Äôt keep driving in this state.‚Äù

The bar grew even quieter.

‚ÄúWas it big?‚Äù someone asked from the back.

I nodded.

‚ÄúWith antlers?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Huge ones. Twisted, almost.‚Äù

The bartender gave me a strange look.

‚ÄúYou sure you killed it?‚Äù

‚ÄúPositive. Its body was wrecked.‚Äù

An old man at a nearby table shook his head.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll come back for you.‚Äù

I let out a nervous laugh.

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

The bartender sighed and leaned in closer.

‚ÄúYou ever heard of the ‚ÄòNight Deer‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like a local legend.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because it is,‚Äù a woman chimed in. She wore a thick jacket and had the look of someone who had seen too much. ‚ÄúThere are deer in these woods that don‚Äôt belong to this world. They aren‚Äôt animals‚Äînot entirely. They‚Ä¶ remember.‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember what?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe faces of those who kill them.‚Äù

I scoffed.

‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs interesting, but‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you hit it,‚Äù the bartender interrupted, ‚Äúit‚Äôs coming for you.‚Äù

I chuckled, but no one else did.


---

The motel I checked into was‚Ä¶ questionable. The sheets smelled musty, and the bedside lamp barely worked. But I was too exhausted to care.

I fell asleep fast.

A knock woke me.

Soft at first. Then louder.

‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù I called, but only silence answered.

The knocking came again.

I walked to the door and peeked through the peephole.

Nothing.

I crawled back into bed, but just as I shut my eyes, another sound filled the room.

This time, it was closer.

A slow, scraping sound against the window.

My pulse pounded. I moved the curtain aside.

And then I saw it.

A deer.

Standing right outside, staring at me with dead eyes. Its body was broken, just as I had left it. But it was still moving.

Then its mouth opened‚Ä¶ and it whispered my name.

I ran.

Didn‚Äôt look back. I sprinted through the parking lot, jumped into my car, and peeled out, not caring that the engine sputtered and struggled to start.


---

I don‚Äôt remember how I made it home. I don‚Äôt know how I drove that far without crashing.

But ever since that night, I haven‚Äôt been alone.

Sometimes, when night falls, I hear a soft knocking on my door. Or the slow, deliberate scratching against my window.

I never open it.

But I know it‚Äôs there.

Waiting.

In college na kami tatlo and they both go to the same school and may kanya kanyang friend groups na din, while im going to school in another city. Pag umuuwi ako sa amin, I always hope na mapagbigyan yung request ko na gumala kami, kaso always di nangyayari.

Nagyaya ako last night na magpunta kami somewhere today. Di muna ako nagsabi na ang plan ko sana today ang ilibre sila ng coffee sa starbucks or something. Kaso di kami natuloy kasi ang excuse is wala dawng pera, busy, etc.

Gets ko naman sana kasi hello, college na kami, time and money is sparse. Kaso paulit-ulit na eh. Everytime nagyayaya ako maraming excuse, and nakikita ko sa mga stories nila may budget naman magpunta ng beach, mag book ng resort etc. with their resepctive friends so alam ko hindi talaga problema yung pera. I'm sad about two things: Last gala namin nung November, napagusapan namin na at least once a month mag memeet kami sa isang cafe. And alam nila both na minsan lang ako nakakauwi and namimiss ko sila. Kaso parang ok lang sa kanila na wala ako so... Ok din. 

Also I think some people would think na baka sila na ang nag hahang-out and ineexclude ako. That's not the case din. Bihira lang sila nagkikita kahit same school sila. Idk bakit okay lang sa kanila ang ganito, ako lang ata ang nalulungkot hahaha.

He proposed na kukha pa siya ng more investors so save his dying business, may plans for renovations, aayusin yung mga issues na nakikita niya nakakacontribute sa problema and even tried to expand sa merch at iba pa para hindi lang iisa ang source ng income nung business. He even got TV guestings recently about it without disclosing the fact na his business is already failing and a lot of investors are getting mad at him due to the lack of growth at dahil hindi na nga rin naibabalik yung pera nung mga tao.

Now, I proposed a rebrand ayusin ang social media presence plus marketing dahil napansin ko na ilang years na nagrrun ang business and their social media presence is prominent pero wala pa ring brand book and yung engagements bumaba unlike before nung peak dahil sa poor management. I'm not a business person, I'm more of a marketing person so kinuha niya ko to help him with that once may funds na pero wala rin nangyari sa plano and hindi nameet yung quota na tinatarget for investment dahil once he annouced na he was taking more investments, yung previous investors commented about their experience which deterred other people from investing at hindi na rin ma ayos yung mga plans. I'm also frustrated of course dahil ang laki rin ng nilagay ko sa business na to at walang bumalik sa akin so instead of putting it down more than it is, I tried to help pero mukhang after our most recent meeting , the owner has decided to completely shut down operations and liquidate all of their assets.

I suggested that he could sell the brand itself dahil personally, I think okay talaga yung potential. Bad management lang, he's too distracted and at the hands of an experienced owner the business could be something big lalo na may niche sila in the first place kaya sila pumutok even nung pandemic. If this is the route we're going to take, where do you advice na we start? How do you sell a losing business?",2,1740308738.0,phinvest,7,0.75,False

1iw7eng,https://i.redd.it/9a35ty2javke1.jpeg,ü§ñ,"For a moment, imagine you‚Äôre Sarah.

It's 9 AM, and Sarah's morning starts differently than most traders. Instead of frantically scanning multiple screens and news feeds, she calmly sips her coffee while Ozak AI's predictive models have already analyzed overnight market movements and prepared her daily briefing.

Sarah notices an alert from her Ozak prediction agent: an unusual pattern in crypto market sentiment that most traders haven't picked up yet. The AI has detected a correlation between recent social media trends and upcoming market movements, something that would take teams of analysts days to spot.

By 11 AM, while other traders are caught off guard by sudden market volatility, Sarah remains unfazed. Ozak's real-time data processing through the Stream Network had flagged potential risks hours ago, allowing her to adjust her positions before the market dip.

Sarah's afternoon involves reviewing Ozak's AI-generated insights for her portfolio optimization. The platform's neural networks process millions of data points, identifying opportunities that align perfectly with her risk tolerance. Unlike traditional trading approaches, she's not just reacting to market changes ‚Äì she's staying ahead of them.

As the trading day winds down, Sarah checks her performance. Thanks to Ozak's predictive AI, she's managed to:

‚Äì Avoid two major market downturns

‚Äì Capitalize on three emerging trends before they became obvious

‚Äì Optimize her portfolio's risk-adjusted returns with minimal emotional bias

With Ozak AI, you can be Sarah. Early adopters of Ozak have already seen their investments triple in value. With the current Phase 3 presale offering tokens at just $0.003, and the next phase priced at $0.005, the opportunity for growth remains substantial.

Don't wait to transform your trading journey.

Sustainability and ethics are becoming increasingly important in global trade. Governments, businesses, and consumers worldwide are demanding **eco-friendly products, fair labor practices, and responsible supply chains**. Exporters who adopt sustainable and ethical practices can **increase their market appeal, comply with global regulations, and build long-term business resilience**.

This guide covers:  
‚úÖ **Importance of sustainable supply chains**  
‚úÖ **Adhering to ethical labor and environmental standards**  
‚úÖ **Certifications and compliance for sustainable exports**

So I had acne from the age of 14-15 around. This is when I started menstruating. Thought it's fine and that this is just puberty thing. Suffered like hell for 4 years. Severe acne I am taking about whole of face, back and chest and then stress from jee preparations really really messed up confidence , skin and hair. 

Tried everything from ayurvedic, homoeopathic and allopathic medicines, dozens of products, did a lot of research about root causes - whether it's hormones, stress, dairy, pollution (I daily went under the sun for coachings) or PCOS. Came to know I don't have PCOS - no major weight gain or body hairs etc. Did a lot of DIY masks, this and that products, changing diet etc. 

Didn't went to Derm for initial years, thinking that it would heal on their own (my father also has acne so was it genes but his disappeared on its own in mid college). But after 4-5 years it really messed up my self confidence so I went to a Derm. She gave my some benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel, tretonin 0.025% cream and benzoyl peroxide facewash and sunscreen (idr correctly).
Used them for some months until 2nd year in college saw some positive effects for some months then didn't felt they will were helping so stopped. 

Did not do a lactose tolerance test coz I liked dairy and my coffee and didn't want to think that I had to leave everything. Though avoided milk and cheese for a long time. 

My takeways -- 
1. Consistency is the key like really it is important.
2. Pls use sunscreen ( I used many from minimalist to Neutrogena to lacto calamine. Recommendations are minimalist, dot & key, L'Sensa). 
3. Stress plays a huge huge role in your skin and hair health. To reduce stress go on walks, exercise, meditate. 
4. Exercise if you can bcoz it would really help. 
5. As mentioned above benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel works, I use it daily after facewash at night.
Facewash > moisturizer > Benzoyl peroxide gel , leave it and sleep.
6. Cover your face with dupatta or balaclava when outdoors even after applying suncreen. Sun would irritate and make your skin sensitive. 
7. Eat good. 
8. There are diff types of acne. Salicylic acid doesn't help everyone. It didn't helped me much only prevented some. But as periods came skin got fucked up again.

When doing so, I also cleaned the stock IMS shower screen with Cafiza (it was quite dirty on the inside).

After the upgrade, I flushed the machine (5x) and cleaned with Cafiza. Flushed again, ensured it was clear, etc.

Coming out of the upgrade, I've found I have to grind significantly finer (Sculptor 078s) than before, and even then my espressos are tasting water, sour and under-extracted. These are with the exact same coffees that were tasting spectacular pre-upgrade. 

The charts look the same, and the machine shows it is reaching the correct pressure bars. But if you look at the end espresso, it visually lacks crema and tastes sour, like a under-extracted espresso would. The tablet is showing a (relatively) fine extraction though. 

I anticipated there would be a little bit of re-dialing in, but this seems significant to me. Has anyone had this experience? ",1,1740306514.0,decentespresso,0,1.0,False

---


In our fast-paced lives, filled with endless to-do lists and future plans, it's easy to lose sight of the present moment. We often find ourselves caught up in what's next, forgetting to cherish the here and now. But what if I told you that the key to reducing anxiety and finding peace lies in focusing on today?

""For now, focus on today. We get too far ahead of ourselves when our focus is not on the present moment, which leads to anxiety. Take it one step at a time,"" someone wise once said. These words carry profound wisdom that resonates deeply with the human experience. They remind us to slow down, to breathe, and to appreciate the beauty of each passing moment.

Let's delve into this idea further. Imagine a typical day: you wake up with a list of tasks racing through your mind, deadlines looming overhead, and a sense of urgency pushing you forward. It's natural to feel overwhelmed when there's so much to do and so little time. But what if, instead of succumbing to the pressure of tomorrow's responsibilities, you decide to focus solely on what needs to be done today?

This shift in perspective can work wonders for your mental well-being. By grounding yourself in the present, you allow yourself the opportunity to fully engage with your surroundings. Whether it's savoring your morning coffee, taking a mindful walk outdoors, or simply pausing to appreciate the warmth of sunlight streaming through your window ‚Äì these are the moments that make life rich and meaningful.

I remember a time when I was rushing through life, always chasing after the next goal or milestone. It wasn't until I consciously made an effort to practice mindfulness and stay present that I began to experience a profound sense of calm. Instead of anxiously worrying about the future, I started focusing on the tasks at hand, trusting that each small step would lead me closer to my goals.

This isn't just about time management; it's about cultivating a mindset of gratitude and awareness. When you prioritize today, you give yourself permission to let go of unnecessary stress and embrace a more balanced approach to life. It's about finding joy in the journey rather than fixating on the destination.

Think of it as laying stepping stones along a path. Each stone represents a moment, a decision, a choice you make in the present. By carefully placing one stone at a time, you create a stable foundation for the future ‚Äì one that's built on mindfulness, resilience, and inner peace.

Of course, this doesn't mean ignoring your aspirations or neglecting long-term plans. It's about striking a harmonious balance between ambition and presence. When you learn to appreciate today, you'll find that tomorrow naturally falls into place. You become more attuned to opportunities that align with your values and goals, making decisions with clarity and intention.

In essence, embracing today is a form of self-care. It's about honoring your journey and respecting your own pace. Just as a painter meticulously crafts each brushstroke to create a masterpiece, you too can craft a fulfilling life by focusing on the canvas of today.

So, the next time you feel overwhelmed by the weight of tomorrow, take a moment to breathe. Remind yourself of the wisdom in these words: ""For now, focus on today."" Embrace the simplicity of the present moment, knowing that it holds the power to transform your perception of time and bring you closer to a state of inner peace.

I have the favourites / tiles etc working fine when I'm both in the house and near my phone.

If I'm far from my phone (it's charging in another room for example), then the HA WearOS app is flakey.

I think many of my issues stem from the Galaxy Watch network handover - e.g. it won't use wifi if connected to a phone by BT - even if that BT connection is uselessly weak.

Does anyone know:

(1) how does the WearOS app trigger things / is BT connection to a phone required?

(2) how does the WearOS app deal with patchy connections? Does it ""cache"" triggers and keep trying until it gets a response?

(3) similar to (1) can the wearOS app work standalone? E.g. I'm in a coffee shop with no phone, but my watch connected to their WiFi?

1iw756r,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1iw756r/shut_down_boundaries/,Shut Down Boundaries,"Ok, here‚Äôs the bit of background: 
- I (22 AFAB, they/them) have been married for about three years and together for five with Staple (24 AMAB they/them). We both have ADHD, but I‚Äôm medicated and Staple doesn‚Äôt think they really need to bother with it. 
- We share one car and can‚Äôt really afford another. I make about 65-70% of our household income, while S makes significantly less. The agreement with this though is that they take care of the primary daily/weekly responsibilities and I take care of the monthly/annual responsibilities, and any small tasks they need help with (pulling meat out for dinner, move clothes to dryer, help carry in/put away groceries, etc.)
- Staple has been spending a lot of time with Ruler (25-26? AMAB he/him), a coworker who shares a lot of similar interests. Neither of us have other partners right now, but I think Ruler may become Staple‚Äôs bf eventually, only time will tell. 
- Staple is the primary user of our car because most of my time is spent with work/school as I work full-time and have a full (15 credit hour) course load. 

This weekend made things really bubble over. Essentially, almost every other weekend Staple spends most of Saturday or Sunday with Ruler. I‚Äôm usually catching up on schoolwork, so I don‚Äôt mind Staple finding something to do other than complain about being ‚Äúcooped up all the time‚Äù on the weekends. The problem arises when Staple doesn‚Äôt ask if they can stay later than the agreed upon time, they will sometimes let me know *after* the time has passed. For example, they said Ruler invited them to play cards from 2-5. I said,‚ÄùOk, but I want to go out for coffee when you get back to reward myself for grinding out all this stupid calc HW.‚Äù Staple said no problem and left.

I was super focused on my work (I got 6 out of my 8 assignments done!) that I didn‚Äôt notice it was 5pm until I got a text at 5:05 that said,‚ÄùWe‚Äôre in the middle of a game right now gonna be later than five‚Äù I was a bit miffed, but let it go. This happens EVERY time, so why should I be surprised? Well, 6pm rolls around and I‚Äôve heard nothing. I finally text and ask if everything‚Äôs ok, when they tell me they‚Äôre JUST NOW leaving. My coffee place closes at 7, but starts tearing down at 6:30. They ask if they should just pick up dinner ‚Äúsince it‚Äôs getting so late‚Äù. At this point, I‚Äôm MAD. 

This is not a one-off situation. This is frequently, and something we‚Äôve had arguments about for years. Every time we have this argument, Staple shuts down and goes dead-eyed, blank-faced. They wait for me to rant for a bit, then pretend everything is normal. I tell them that ‚Äúmakes me feel like a crazy b*tch‚Äù when they do that, and then they usually apologize, say I‚Äôm not crazy, and that they‚Äôll try to do better.

I‚Äôm so considerate of their time when I go out to events. I tell them when to expect me, and then I ASK if they‚Äôre comfortable with me staying later (should the occasion arise). The only time I tend to lose track of time is when my family is visiting, but that‚Äôs twice a year maybe. Almost always, they say they‚Äôre fine with me staying later, but when I call on my way home after the event I‚Äôm met with a laundry list of horrible problems we‚Äôve been neglecting (have I scheduled the maintenance for X problem? has our cat ALWAYS had a sort of snore? when was the last time the tub was cleaned?) so on and so forth. Like they‚Äôve just been sitting at home with their thoughts and now I must hear them instead of debriefing on my fun event. Sometimes they find things to do, and more recently that was our solution so Staple wasn‚Äôt sitting at home worrying. 

It became really draining to go out, and when school picked back up in August, it was so much easier to just not do it. We moved this past summer so I haven‚Äôt made many friends up here to begin with, but I genuinely cannot feel motivated to go out due to the mental exhaustion of work/school most of the time. The stressful evening afterwards feels like icing on a shit cake. 

When Staple tells me a time and sticks to it, I try hard to praise and make the coming home for them as fun as possible. I ask them what all they did, if they had fun, etc. I‚Äôm someone who feels compersion so easily, so I love talking about what great fun my partners have. When Staple doesn‚Äôt stick to a time, but it doesn‚Äôt interrupt my schedule, I tend to bring it up after I‚Äôve gotten the full debrief. If it does interrupt my schedule, I tend to bring it up when they walk in because they always come in with a half assed apology. It hurts more sometimes because it feels like they were thinking about the fact that I had to rearrange my plans and just didn‚Äôt care. There was a solid month period for half of Jan and half of Feb that we were really going well on communicating times and expectations, I started to see a light at the end of the tunnel. Then tonight happens and I really lost it. I started crying and was just so frustrated. At one point I asked why they don‚Äôt respect my time, and they said that wasn‚Äôt fair. I demanded a good answer for why this bad habit keeps happening and they just shrugged me off.

I got even more frustrated and actually yelled,‚ÄùWell we‚Äôre not going to get dinner until you give me a good answer.‚Äù Staple tried again with the ‚ÄúAww babe, you know I‚Äôm sorry, I just lost track of time‚Äù routine. I said that wasn‚Äôt good enough and we sat in silence for a LLLLOOONNNGGG time until they explained that didn‚Äôt think it was that big of a deal, but now they see how much it hurt me, and they will try be better again. Apparently, for the last couple weeks they‚Äôve been setting alarms so they don‚Äôt lose track of time. They thought they didn‚Äôt need to this time because it was just a casual game of cards. 

I get time blindness, but somehow it‚Äôs just my time that is encroached upon. I try to be organized and considerate for everyone involved. I just wish I‚Äôd gotten my damn coffee tonight. I was so mad I kept things icy all night, which I know is wrong. I just didn‚Äôt want to cuddle or kiss when I was this angry. I did feel a bit better after dinner, but when I sat down to file our taxes I did as much as I could alone and when we did our shared tv time, I didn‚Äôt engage in our normal commentary. 

I don‚Äôt resent them for having a flourishing social life or this coworker, I genuinely like the guy. I bought tickets for those two to a Naruto Symphonic Experience thing next month since I know how much they both like Naruto. I feel like this has only been a problem for the last two years we‚Äôve shared a vehicle. I thought Staple was getting better, and tonight just made me feel so neglected and alone. I wish they wouldn‚Äôt shut down when I get upset, and that we‚Äôd find a productive solution to this. ",1,1740306014.0,polyamory,9,0.67,False
