But at least the ideas and evaluations and time I used to structure the report should at least demonstrate sth, so I submitted my work 2 days earlier than the actual date, and the teacher responsible for the assessment just emailed me saying my work is 100% Ai generated, and ask me to rewrite my........ Like logically, wtf? I can't re-write an AI-generated essay if it is not AI-generated in the first place, and if I actually used AI, I could just submit it at least a week earlier, so I can have more time to fix the potential detected content, and now I only have 2 days till the due date, with a 4000 words Human-generated Ai essay, Ima just giving up on this shit.

Let’s take a moment and really think about the phrase, “What you think, you become.” At first glance, it might sound like one of those motivational quotes you see plastered on a coffee mug or a poster of a sunset. But when you dig deeper, there’s a profound truth hidden within these words. This isn’t just a catchy phrase—it’s a principle that can shape your entire life. So, let’s unpack it together.  

#### The Foundation of the Thought-Action Connection  

Imagine for a moment you’re planting seeds in a garden. Each thought you have is like one of those seeds. If you plant seeds of positivity, self-belief, and kindness, what grows in your garden? Beautiful flowers, tall trees, and perhaps some delicious fruit. But if you plant seeds of doubt, anger, and negativity, your garden might turn into a tangle of weeds. The connection between your thoughts and what grows in your life is real.  

Psychologists often talk about something called “self-fulfilling prophecies.” It’s a fancy way of saying that what you expect to happen often does happen—because your expectations influence your actions. If you constantly think, “I’m not good enough,” you might avoid opportunities, hesitate to take risks, or give up too easily. But if you think, “I can do this,” your behavior aligns with that belief. You take chances, work hard, and push through challenges.  

#### A Personal Story of Shifting Thoughts  

Let me share a story. Years ago, I used to believe I wasn’t creative. I’d tell myself, “I’m just not one of those people who can come up with original ideas.” Guess what? I didn’t come up with original ideas—because I wasn’t even trying. I’d convinced myself it wasn’t in me, so I didn’t bother to explore it.  

One day, a friend challenged me. She said, “What if you’re wrong? What if creativity is like a muscle you just haven’t exercised yet?” That thought stuck with me. I started experimenting—writing short stories, doodling in notebooks, and trying new ways to solve problems at work. Slowly, my belief about myself began to change. I went from “I’m not creative” to “I’m learning to be creative.” And guess what? The more I thought of myself as creative, the more creative I became.  

#### The Science Behind It  

There’s actual science backing up the idea that our thoughts shape us. Neuroscience has a concept called neuroplasticity, which means our brains can change and adapt based on our thoughts and experiences. Think of it like rewiring a circuit board. If you consistently think, “I’m capable,” your brain strengthens the neural pathways associated with confidence and capability.  

On the flip side, if you dwell on negative thoughts, those pathways become stronger. It’s like carving a path through a forest—the more you walk it, the clearer and more defined it becomes. But here’s the good news: you can always carve a new path. It takes effort, but it’s possible.  

#### The Role of Perspective  

Let’s not forget how powerful perspective is. Two people can experience the exact same situation but interpret it completely differently based on their thoughts. For instance, imagine two friends lose their jobs on the same day. One thinks, “This is the end of the world. I’ll never recover.” The other thinks, “This is a tough break, but it’s also a chance to find something better.”  

Who do you think will bounce back faster? The second person, of course. Their mindset opens them up to possibilities, while the first person’s thoughts trap them in despair.  

#### Building a Mindset That Serves You  

Changing your thought patterns doesn’t happen overnight, but it’s absolutely doable. Here’s how you can start:  

1. **Practice Self-Awareness**  
   Pay attention to your inner dialogue. What are you telling yourself? Are your thoughts kind and encouraging, or critical and limiting?  

2. **Challenge Negative Thoughts**  
   When a negative thought pops up, question it. Ask yourself, “Is this really true? What evidence do I have for or against this thought?”  

3. **Replace and Reframe**  
   Instead of saying, “I can’t do this,” try, “I can learn to do this.” Instead of, “I always mess up,” try, “I’m learning from my mistakes.”  

4. **Surround Yourself with Positivity**  
   Spend time with people who uplift and inspire you. Read books, listen to podcasts, and consume content that reinforces the mindset you want to cultivate.  

#### Examples from History and Culture  

History is full of people who embody the idea that “what you think, you become.” Take Thomas Edison, for example. He didn’t invent the lightbulb on his first try—or his hundredth. He famously said, “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” His belief in himself and his mission kept him going.  

On the flip side, think about someone consumed by self-doubt or negativity. Their thoughts can become a prison, limiting what they attempt and achieve. This isn’t just about success in the conventional sense—it’s about living a fulfilled, meaningful life.  

#### Why This Matters Now  

In today’s world, it’s easy to get caught up in negativity. Social media, the news, and even casual conversations often focus on what’s wrong rather than what’s possible. That’s why it’s more important than ever to guard your thoughts.  

If you’re constantly thinking, “The world is a mess, and there’s nothing I can do about it,” that’s exactly how you’ll act. But if you think, “I can make a difference, even in small ways,” your actions will reflect that belief.  

#### Closing Thoughts  

“What you think, you become” isn’t just a feel-good mantra—it’s a roadmap for living a better life. Your thoughts are powerful tools. They can build you up or tear you down, open doors or close them, create joy or invite despair.  

So, what kind of life do you want to create? Start by planting the right seeds in your mind. Nurture them with patience and care. Over time, you’ll see how your thoughts shape not just who you are, but the world around you.

1iitwru,https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubeBadActors/comments/1iitwru/dear_gray/,Dear Gray,"Since it’s quite obvious that Gray monitors this subreddit, I will direct these comments to him. I apologize in advance for this long post. These are all MY OPINIONS ONLY 

Gray. You literally asked your viewers to explain to you why they can’t/won’t pay you their money every night. First of all, no one owes you an explanation for ANYTHING. You asked so you should be grateful for the feed back-even if you don’t like it. Your viewers are telling YOU what the reality is (something you like to say often) You just don’t want to hear it. You call them a troll, stupid, idiot or whatever your derogatory word is for the night. Someone last night simply answered you by saying not everyone can afford to donate every single night. That should have been enough of an answer for you, but you were so rude to that viewer and it was completely unnecessary. Not everyone is there to troll you. It makes you sound ridiculous and delusional everytime you make that accusations. You lose so many new followers because of your nasty attitude. You don’t allow any type of debate or discussion in your chat. Other TC channels (that you regularly trash) foster a healthy community, with diverse perspectives and opinions on a range of TC cases. They are respectful of their viewers and respectful of the victims, families and their stories and in turn, THEY get respect. They don’t say they regret covering a case because they weren’t paid enough when they did. They are sincerely grateful for any monetary support they receive and they don’t stop the show 10 times to ask for it. Trust and believe, you don’t have to remind everyone. Everyone knows and hears when you ask. You’re not talking to a brick wall. We all hear you. Viewers of other channels freely give because they believe the host deserves it and because they want to give. These channels are out growing yours by leaps and bounds because of these things. People don’t like being called an idiot. They don’t like being told they are stupid. They don’t like being accused of being a troll. They don’t like being told they are morons for watching other TC channels. They don’t like being talked down to or be embarrassed in chat by the host. 
You frequently say it yourself: you’re doing the same thing you’ve always done. For the last 5 years, you do the show, every. single. night. People typically donate to charity once a year, not every single day. That is not realistic and is completely unsustainable. Your viewers have given to you until they just can’t do it anymore. Do you even realize that some of your viewers are going without something that they may enjoy, so they can pay you a certain amount every night (Cindy’s comment about not having any type of tv service or anything but she pays you weekly and monthly). How sad is that?? It isn’t right to make anyone feel like that’s ok. You shouldn’t ask them to go without something-even if it’s just a Starbucks coffee, so they can pay you that money instead. 
Stop with the sniveling, poor pity me routine, man up and take responsibility for why your channel is failing. Your channel is exactly that-YOURS. Your actions and behavior have begun to make your viewers question your integrity. I’m all for people making a living on YouTube. Go get it! The problem that I and many others have, is how you go about doing it. When you beg for money every show, it turns people off. When you base your decision of covering a case on how much money it can bring you and not the victims and their stories, it makes you appear disingenuous. It makes your viewers feel gross and uncomfortable. 
I am not here and saying these things because I want “a pound of flesh”. I am not a troll. I am a normal person who likes true crime and found your channel on YouTube. I like YouTube because there is a lot to choose from and IT’S FREE to watch. I gave you a chance because I was genuinely interested in what you were covering and you treated me so horribly in chat, called me names, embarrassed me and blocked me. I unsubscribed and said never again will I support you. That led me to finding out that I am not alone and you have done this to many, many, many people. As you have said, maybe it is a good idea to put your time and energy into making good videos and take a break from lives. You are miserable and stressed and it shows. If you are struggling financially, you don’t HAVE to donate to charities every month. You WANT to, but you don’t HAVE to. Just as you tell your viewers-if you don’t have it, don’t give it! Straighten out your priorities and take the time to reflect on what your viewers are telling you is THEIR reality. Maybe, just maybe, you will see things change. 
Sincerely,
Not a troll 👿 ",1,1738814931.0,youtubeBadActors,0,1.0,False

1iitvnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1iitvnv/i_am_terrified_to_ask_out_my_crush/,I am terrified to ask out my crush,"I (26m) have a crush on a girl (24) that I have seen just a few tines in the past couple of months and I want to ask her out but I am scared sh*tless. I am a relatively shy person. 

To give a bit of context, we are both students (msc and bsc) in a 3rd country and live in a student accomodation complex. There is a volunteer run bike repair workshop where I started going since last spring. In early autumn, a girl and her friend (also f and 25ish) came to repir a bike. I was dealing with my own business but we exchanged a few words, like names, countries, studies. Then maybe a month later, I was hanging out there when she came again for getting a tool and directly approached me to ask about it, I helped her find it and we chatted for about 10-15 minutes, I just went for a car trip a day before with friends so I showed sone pics, general light chat, I just got my drivers license in this country so I was super proud of it and showed it, joked about the picture and got a light compliment out of her. At that point I didnt think anything about this interaction. But when I left the workshop that evening I felt so amazing, I wanted to ask her out if I saw her again. Yet, I didnt and a month ago or so I felt like I was over her... until last monday when she came with her friend. There we chatted a bit and I was going to bring some sweets next week so I told them to come next week too and they agreed.

Now a bit more specific stuff. I know she likes board games (I do too) and that she is single. I had to go meet a friend that day so I left early and she questioned that a bit, like what I had to do on a mondays evening. 

Due to some terrible timing, next week there is no way for me to organize a board games night to invite her and a beer or coffee invite may be too forward at this point. There are some other details too but the post is long enough I guess. 

I havent been on any proper dates in the last 6 years, and my last proper relationship was 8 years ago. So I am really out of my comfort zone. She seems very approachable, we are both from mediterranean countries. The main thing that bothers me is that the workshop is like a lifeline for me, and my mental health. I am afraid of making my safeplace uncomfortable. And ofcourse I am scared of rejection. Her being almost always with her friend also does not help. But if I don't ask her out I will hate myself for missing out on such an amazing person.

1iitvab,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/1iitvab/gerd_symptoms_off_birth_control/,GERD symptoms/ Off Birth control,"Hi! I’m 22f. I was on and off birth control (Yaz pill) for about a year, but 7 months ago I decided I’d suck it up and be off of it for good. I’ve had GERD symptoms for about a year or two and it seems like it’s at its worst now at the 7-8 months mark. I’m assuming my GERD symptoms started when I got off birth control for the first time. My acne is also at its worst. But I’m trying my best to sit it out and let my body adjust. I’m hoping my GERD symptoms go away soon. I used to have really uncomfortable varicose vein pain but that went away about a month ago, so I’m assuming my body is gradually adjusting and that’s why I don’t feel that pain anymore. But the GERD symptoms suck so bad and I can’t really pinpoint what’s causing it sometimes. Coffee definitely makes my symptoms worse and the usual junk food. But sometimes when I don’t drink coffee it honestly just doesn’t help. Does anyone else relate to having GERD symptoms after they got off birth control? A lot of people are saying they had GERD while they took birth control and it went away when they got off. But it has gotten worse for me since being off birth control. Does anyone relate and what was the time frame in which the symptoms improved? My stress/anxiety got bad around the 6-7 month mark but I’m getting better so I’m also wondering if that added to my GERD symptoms. Anyways I’d just like to know if there is a light at the end of the tunnel. ",1,1738814792.0,birthcontrol,1,1.0,False

I’m a design student working on a class project and exploring ways to make Duolingo more engaging. Would love to hear your thoughts!

# The Idea: Duolingo Riddles + IRL Meetups

A fun new feature where users solve 1–2 language-based riddles per week to earn XP and gems, keeping their streaks alive. To boost engagement, the top 10 leaderboard participants could win Duolingo merch (plushies, virtual stickers, etc.).

To take it a step further, I’m designing a **MeetUp collaboration**—allowing users to find **themed in-person events** (like a coffee shop gathering, campus pop-up, or food truck) where they can solve riddles, practice languages, and connect with fellow learners.

# How It Works

* **Duolingo Riddles:** A weekly challenge integrated into lessons without altering the app’s core experience.
* **IRL Meetups via Meetup.com:** Users can locate language-learning events nearby with MeetUp.
* **Social Sharing:** Players can share achievements with friends to encourage friendly competition.
* **Community Engagement:** Potential for discussion forums, social media campaigns, and exclusive in-person events.

Would this be something you’d participate in? Open to any feedback—especially on what would make the riddles + meetups more exciting, allow you to come back to Duolingo and keep on learning, and shareable!

I feel guilty for feeling the way I do,"Hello, i posted this on other subreddits but wanted to know the opinion of more people since i only got a few replies. i should probably go to a therapist for this but the therapist at my college is the worst and i cant really afford therapy rn (i cant use insurance either my parents would see and they dont believe in therapy)

I (F18) live with my parents because i attend community college. My mother is screaming her lungs out as i type this. shes getting screwed over by her brothers. Her health is constantly at risk from the amount of anxiety and lack of doctor appointments. She never goes to any doctor, ever, she strongly believes that as long as she doesnt know that anything is wrong that means nothing is wrong. She doesnt eat enough, shes constantly complaining of some sort of health issue. She has frequent panic/anxiety attacks. Growing up i tried my best to help her. Im her therapist, caretaker, and everything I could be. I had an incredible amount of anxiety as a child especially due to the way she doesnt take care of herself. Anyway, other than that, shes incredible critical of everything I do and say. I mean i walk on eggshells around her. She takes EVERYTHING personally, and i mean everything. To get a better idea: the other day she was showing me the doilies she made when she was younger (i know shes really proud of them) I said ""wow theyre so pretty, when i have my own house I want to out these on my coffee table they will look great"" and she seemed to like that compliment. Anyway, then a few days later she wanted to borrow press on nails but I told her i dont have any and she tried to look in my drawers anyway and i said ""dont"" and then she slammed my door and yelled for about 40 minutes. I usually stay quiet when shes screaming but she said (pretending to be me saying this) ""Im gonna move out and im gonna live alone and make my own money!!!!"" and i had to step in and say that thats not what i said at all its not true at all. She also seksualises everything i wear (im not sure if that word is ok to say on here ha). She would try to break the bathroom door when I was like 15 thinking im sending nudes when i never even gave her any reason to think that + i always take my phone to the bathroom she knows this. Regardless, basically i hope thats a good idea of the kind of person she is. Shes very controlling but i feel bad. I feel bad for everything. I have 2 jobs, I attend college full time, and I take care of housework when I can (im shamed if i dont for even one day). She tells me im selfish and horrible, that I only care for myself and that I am the worst person in the world and that Im an idiot. She says how happy i will be once shes dead.

I have 2 older brothers and a dad and ill make this one short

The two brothers are very different but theyre both super controlling, especially the oldest one. Hes kind of like my mom in the sense that everything i wear is seksualized. My dad doesnt care what i wear, he has anger issues tho. Big anger issues. All my life ive gone between feeling bad for my dad for marrying my mom and vice versa. My mom convinced me that my dad is evil for the first like 8 years of my life. I was made to hate him since the day I was born and I feel so guilty about that. I dont hate him, but he is very hateful. My parents argue at least twice a week on a good week. When they dont argue it feels like the air is still and im just waiting for them to yell again. my brother yelled today and called me selfish and that i dont appreciate anything in this world (he drives me places), he yelled this because I asked him to clean the mess he left in the bathroom.

im just very confused on where i stand. i want to say i love them but i never do because i dont know if thats how i feel. I dont hate them. Like i dont want anything bad to happen to them i just want them to be healthy and happy but they wont do that for themselves. I feel bad and angry. Im so angry all the time. This past year i have been short fused because i just cant take it anymore ill explode anyminute at this point. I have 2 more semesters before i transfer to university...

TLDR; complicated family relationship, my mom screams and says she hates me - criticizes me then love bombs me. 2 older brothers are over bearing and dad with anger issues. I feel guilty like all of this is my fault even tho i know its not and im so so angry i dont know what to do.",1,1738813563.0,self,0,1.0,False

I am 35/m, she is 40/f.

I met her at a bar and we hit it off pretty well. She told me immediately she wanted to take it slow as she’s coming out of a relationship. I say cool.

Our first date is at bar trivia, we made out after. Great.

Second date was her friends birthday party. Fun.

Third date was coffee.

Fourth date bar trivia again. Made out after.

Fifth date was another of her friend’s birthday party. Same “group” as before. She said her friends loved me. We went back to her house and made out, and she made it very clear she didn’t want to hook up yet and really appreciated me respecting that. 


During this time (about a month) she would send me photos in lingerie etc, and she would say how turned on she was about the idea of sleeping together, wanted to show me her lingerie etc. we agreed if we never hooked up we would still remain friends because she said I’m great to talk to and she’s learned a lot and likes the way I think (we are from different cultures). 


All of a sudden the day after the 5th date her texts seem very short, much less frequent and without much opportunity for me to respond/have a convo.

What the hell happened? My only ideas:

* we moved too fast
* she didn’t see a long term relationship for whatever reason (different cultures).
* I said something awful the last time I saw her 
* she’s just busy and I’m freaking out over nothing

I wish she would just tell me. I feel awful not knowing. I’m not going to text her and ask her, I think that would be inappropriate. Or is it appropriate to desire an explanation?",2,1738813489.0,ghosting,0,1.0,False
1iitgg6,https://i.redd.it/d2zzk3o7xfhe1.png,"""UnderTale Blue: Legacy"" (Yes, another fangame)","*  Hello, good morning, afternoon or evening, dear Reddit user! Come in, you are absolutely welcome. I see you're tired; do you want a cup of coffee?

. . .

*  Oh, do you want to know about the game?

* Haha of course. Sorry, sometimes I go around the bush.

* I guess it's time to introduce you to ""Undertale Blue: Legacy"".

NOTE: We advise you to play Undertale and Undertale Yellow before this, as it contains major spoilers for both of those games.

-- A prequel made by and for fans that takes place in the Undertale Yellow and Undertale universe. You play as the 3rd human, ""Sadako"",  a teenage human girl who had the misfortune to fall immediately after Toriel had just finished checking up to see if anyone else had fallen. Without a Toriel to give you a tuToriel (Get it?) to face the challenges of the ruins, you'll have to rely on yourself to discover the mysteries that the underground hides. Surely that's all gonna end well... right?

-- Don't be afraid if you end up getting lost in the lost ruins, I'm sure you'll find the way!

*  What do you mean by ""talking flower""?

*  There aren't echo flowers in the ruins, silly!

*  We better continue!

(Yes, there's no Flowey. Lore reasons.)

-- Undertale Blue: Legacy takes into account the canon established by Undertale Yellow and tells the story of the blue soul human mentioned in said game. At this point, you're probably thinking that the game is not going to have much originality to it, right? I'm pleased to inform you that you couldn't be more wrong. The UTY canon is a starting point, yes, but not the whole story. UTB:L has its own story and its own identity, so don't be worried too much, because this game has 3 new zones and a lot to offer! (Yeah, 6 areas, wish us luck... please.)

-- Our game is a product that seeks to take the average UnderTale fan out of their comfort zone, introducing different characters than one might be accustomed to.

-- In ""UnderTale Blue: Legacy"" you will see the cruelest and dirtiest aspects of the human species portrayed. If you are looking for a fun game suitable for everyone, then this is not your game.

-- Discover new friends, enemies, bosses, routes and secrets in this fangame, play with new mechanics and have fun because this game has...

-ACTION!

-DRAMA!

_*History*_
-- Long after the famous ""war between Humans and Monsters"", humans educated future generations under the guise of that war being just a medieval fantasy story, something that never happened. However, those stories shared through generations, always shared an important similarity, the war had been started by monsters, and had claimed many more lives of innocent humans than monsters.

-- And although the story was just ""fiction"", in the vast majority of cases, these stories are based on true events. Mount Ebott has always been a place full of mysteries, such as the disappearance of 2 human childs who never returned to their homes.

-- Sadako's family is a very superstitious one, who firmly believed in all the rumors that were said about Mount Ebott, and of course, the fact that there were evidence that supported these beliefs only made the situation more threatening. The girl of Japanese origin was very close to her family, and a doubt gnawed her: What could happen if the monsters ever escaped from their prison? The situation was one of fear, but also hatred. Sadako didn't want to face a situation like that, but if she had to, she would give her best.

-- Those beasts had mercilessly attacked the human kind. They didn't deserve forgiveness... Or at least that's what she believed.

1iitfhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1iitfhf/an_introduction_and_a_question/,An introduction and a question,"Hi everybody,

Over 10 years ago when I was in grad school I had a very stressful finals week. I remember feeling a general feeling of malaise for several days (just a general sick feeling almost nauseating), I felt like my chest/stomach were full after eating/drinking hardly anything, and then I ended up becoming extremely nauseated and throwing up. But it wasn't the kind of throwing up that made you feel better afterwards. It just made me feel like death. For about a week I lived off of antacids + the blandest food imaginable. The lack of coffee almost killed me because I had such bad caffeine withdrawal, but then almost like a miracle, I woke up one day and felt normal. I swore I would never let my body get that worn down or drink too much coffee ever again. Well, promises made, promises not kept. 

I have had this sort of episode happen probably once a year over the last 10 years. After stressful holidays, during busy seasons with work, during times when I find myself staying up too late and drinking too much caffeine... That feeling of malaise creeps in, almost like a prickly sick feeling accompanied with a very full feeling after eating or drinking/burping a ton, and the inevitable waking up in the middle of the night because it feels like I'm having a heart attack due to reflux.

2 weeks ago I had some of the worst gerd I've ever had that I thought was going to put me in the ground. I have a very stressful job + I realized I was eating like garbage around the holidays and it finally caught up with me. I'm on omeprazole now, which seems to be helping. I can eat and drink, but I still feel extremely full after eating very little for a 40-year-old man. I'm not overweight. I exercise regularly and run everyday. I don't smoke and I don't drink. I do like coffee, but I've had to cut it out of my life. I'm grateful to find a community that gets it. 

Here's the question I have for you. I recently started an omeprazole regimen and it has been successful. I'm about halfway through my 2 weeks. I haven't had this experience with Omeprazole before, but I have a constant sour taste in my mouth. How do you get rid of it? It kind of tastes like an antibiotic metallic taste that won't go away. I've even eaten and it stays. It's really gross. 

Thanks. Just wanted to say hi.",1,1738813393.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

1iitcvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1iitcvx/success_story_tips_and_tricks/,Success story- tips and tricks,"I’ll be real- if it wasn’t for this forum I am convinced my recovery would have been much more challenging (huge thanks to everyone who’s posted!). My doc office only gave me one or two pointers/post op expectations - the bulk of what really impacted my comfort during recovery was found here as a presurgery lurker on this forum and from my own trial and error. In an effort to “pay it forward “ to anyone out there who is presurgery and anxious, I’ve compiled a list of tips that I hope can help. Prepping made all the difference- you can’t control the surgery or parts or the recovery, but you can control how prepared you are for the few parts you can control. (For reference- I’m 32F with surgery done in USA due to recurrent strep (7 times a year) I had smaller tonsils and otherwise healthy). Feel free to DM if you have day-specific questions bc I did take daily notes as well. Pain wise- it was an uncomfortable recovery and it followed what a lot of people reported- the pain gets increasingly worse before it gets better. that’s a bummer but it felt good to know I wasn’t experiencing anything abnormal. Overall it was manageable- there are “good days” and “bad days” but the good news is that pain is temporary (even when it feels super intense/overwhelming). Sometimes mid day wouldn’t have much pain at all, other days it was constant discomfort but all manageable. Hope these tips help!  

- TIPS   -
- Re surgery- if cauterizing method used, make sure you take off all metal jewelry head to TOE (right before going back for surgery I remembered a toe ring I had on and some small rings in my hair- the nurse said it 100% had to be removed bc the electricity could be diverted to anything metal on me and leave a serious burn or cause the tool to malfunction)
- Wait 15-20 mins after meds to eat, helps with pain so you can eat more. I was hardly ever hungry (though always craving pizza!). I didn’t not lose any weight. 
- Always be drinking (my doc reminded me that whatever pain I felt during drinking would only be worse if I became dehydrated- lots of “grin and bear it” (or in my case “hit your leg while drinking for a distraction from discomfort”) moments regarding water intake this whole recovery but always worth it
- Set alarms for pain meds (it’s much harder to catch up with the pain than to just keep covered even though it means disrupting sleep- 100% worth it) AND keep a whiteboard of your meds, dosage amts and ‘last taken’ next to your recovery bed- this helped me plan for my next day of alarms and acted as a secondary check point to make sure I wasn’t accidentally over dosing myself in the tired/painful moments where you can be less careful and woozy from meds. Also, tell your doc if a med causes more symptoms (oxy and zofran gave me migraine level headaches. Doc switched it to hydrocodone and headaches went away and everything seemed easier- advocate for yourself!)
- If you have kids/animals/household upkeep that you’re getting help with, make a spreadsheet- seriously, it may seem excessive in the moment but this helps your caregiver/s know what needs to be done what days at what times (school pick up, animal feeding etc) and they have access so they don’t need to wake you up or ask questions re schedule 
- Download a free text to talk app (I used ‘Text to Speech’) so you don’t have to speak at all the first few days. I ended up not talking at all for over a week and I’m sure that helped the healing. 
- Avoid coughing! If you feel the cough-itch, drink water and chew gum!
- ACT dry mouth gum helps with pain, helps suppress coughs and works out your jaw before meals (less throat muscle spasms during eating i found if I chewed before)
- Wedge pillow for sleeping (easier to deal with than 4 pillows moving around all night)
- Mouth tape during all naps/sleeping. I used 3M micropore tape- inexpensive and didn’t cause irritation or discomfort (I have never taped before so I was surprised how easy it was to get used to). I never woke up with a dry throat!
- Arnica - this is an herbal OTC supplement. My ENT said it could help so I used it every day (dissolve on tongue type)
- Get up very slowly- the meds and surgery take a toll on you and it’s easy to get light headed (especially because you’ll be up peeing a lot if you’re pushing fluids!)
- If you have a caregiver- write down foods they can make for you- makes it super simple for them to whip something up that you know will work from your list (be specific like ‘no red jello’ or ‘no dairy’). Even if you’re alone- writing out the food before surgery is one less thing you’ll have to think about (I ended up putting all the non perishable options on my table so I didn’t have to go looking for anything middle of night when hungry etc)
- Herbal rice sock to heat up- helped relieve pressure/pain in my ears, I used this every few hours, daily 
- My food list (the kind will depend on which day post op) : scrambled eggs (no milk), dairy free yogurt, apple sauce, Pedialyte pops (not the pink ones bc ouch), refried beans, instant potatoes, chicken and beef broth, overcooked noodles and butter, dairy free protein shake (OWYN), egg noodles, Luke warm coffee 
- Some people have no issue with dairy regarding mucus- I was not one of those lucky people. I stayed dairy free and it helped immensely!
- My doc prescribed a stool softener/laxative and it came in handy bc heavier meds every few hours can really be a pain on your digestion. You can get these OTC as well. 
- Have humidifiers next to your bed running 24/7 (I’m in a dry state but this was never an issue)
- I used tongue scrapers- helpful for breath and mucus but did leave mouth dry so I used XyliMelts at night which helped 
- Ask for steroids- this helped my tongue swelling immensely (I only got 2 tabs for day 3 and 6 but it was enough)
- Throat muscle spasms were the worst side effect of surgery for me and they were triggered after drinking or eating. I found it helped a lot to relax my shoulders, calm my facial muscles and breathe deeply before eating/drinking- this relaxes me and helped with pain

Most important of all- don’t panic when the pain starts. It will come and go like waves on a beach and it will not last forever. Healing time doesn’t stop during the pain so stay strong, acknowledge the discomfort, breathe through it and trust your body. remember why you chose this surgery and be grateful you have access to this medical help as many do not. Wishing you all healing and strength. It’ll be worth it. ",2,1738813156.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False

1iitckt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1iitckt/questions_concerning_the_yoga_nidra/,Questions concerning the yoga nidra,"Hi healthygamers,

I have some questions about the yoga nidra for those who are experienced with this kind of meditation. I will start with my goals about this yoga. I have watched Dr.K's video about it and got really intrigued. I have been grinding my skills in art for the past 10 years and I want to put it to the next level. After watching the videos about the yoga nidra video, I wanted to have lucid dreams and keep practicing my guitar skills during my sleep after the exercises I did during the day.

Last summer, I did the yoga nidra for 1 month everyday and about 1 time per 2 days the next months. I got demotivated because of the fatigue before going to sleep and hadn't any strength left during some nights. I want to give it another try this year. I stopped coffee, drink alcohol only on saturday and don't do any drug. Even without the yoga nidra, I sleep very well.

If I succeed in having lucid dreams after 3 months for example, will I have to keep meditating or it will kind of be unlocked for the time being?

Do I need to meditate right before going to sleep or I can do it maybe 1 hour before going to bed?

Is it fine to just take 10 big breaths after the yoga nidra and do I need to tell and ask myself some existential question like in the Dr.K's video yoga nidra practice? Maybe you guys can send me some more references please?

1iitb8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1iitb8n/is_lying_by_omission_deceitful_and_is_deceit/,"Is lying by omission deceitful? And is 'deceit' dependent on a persons good / bad intentions? I (48f) didn't share my sexual past early in our relationship, but fully intended to tell him (50m) eventually  -  he says I lied and deceived him. How do I rebuild trust?","Has anyone been with someone whose past / and not sharing their past upfront negatively affected the relationship? Did you manage to get to a place where you rebuilt trust and did they forgive you?


Background: I (48f) met him (50m) in middle age. We were long distance at first and fell in love… it felt beautiful and closer than anything I had experienced. It was intense and got serious fast. It's been THE most profoundly in love I have ever been.  We’ve now been together 5 years. 

He's so unhappy and wants to leave - and its been that way and up and down for a while.

The context for why my past did not come out really early, it wasn’t an ordinary past …  ( trigger warning, explicit and includes SA):  I have a full on sexual / trauma past.
I was a victim of SA (rape) at age 16. This lead to low self-worth and years of bad choices, probably also combined also with a tendency to be too trusting and not speak up for myself. 

The biggest bad choices I made were a brief but violent relationship, being an escort (prostitute) for a year, a suicide attempt. All while still in my teens.

Over the years I got therapy, got my life together for the most part. I returned to study, built a career and had a few loving relationships with kind, good men.

In my late 30s, desperately for a family,  I made yet another mistake  - a relationship with an alcoholic who ended up being my child’s dad. Love my child – no regrets there. Didn’t realise the dad’s alcohol and mental health issues when we met. Not surprisingly it did not last. When we split I was relieved, but fearful of life as a solo mum, and felt like a massive failure.  Afterwards.. well I didn’t conduct myself in a way I’m proud of. 
About 6 months after the split from my kid’s dad I went on tinder. Over the next couple of years I had a few short liaisons, not one night stands, more like seeing people for a month or so, beginnings that didn’t go far. Most dates I had on tinder were meeting for coffee – nothing remotely sexual. But it all generally seemed quite depressing and I was convinced I’d never meet a life partner. 
Shamefully in this time, fully thinking I was pretty worthless and not 'relationship material' I hooked up with a married man off tinder, had sex a couple of times, realised he was creepy,  a serial cheater idk - blocked him. 
And - during this time, with one of the people I dated for a few months I tried the act of deep throat / oral sex. I’d not tried before – I’m middle aged for one thing, they were younger – and despite my past (yes, even despite my past described above) I had not done that before. These were the things that came out later in a way that damaged my relationship. For the record I’m not proud of the things I did, for being that disconnected from myself, that unable to be on my own.

FAST FORWARD - I ditch tinder. Yuk. Then I meet my partner (in person through friends). We form a deep connection. He is  kind, gentle, funny and incredibly clever, handsome with a voice and eyes that melt me. Our conversations are deep, our physical connection felt so strong it kind of woke up my sexuality - I felt loved, sexy and my body felt truly responsive (which many victims of past SA may understand the disconected feeling that can exist).

Two months in he felt an inkling about my sexual past... In those first months, talking, texting lots, I did tell him about my SA. I felt I’ve healed a lot from that – the hardest thing really is you feel this abiding sense that society sees you as ‘damaged’. And I think my sense of stigma did make me reticent to share stuff too soon.  THEN ONE NIGHT - He said he wondered if I had ever been a prostitute. This freaked me out. He talked about visiting a brothel with a friend when young. He did not see a prostitute himself, waited at the bar, but seemed to think I was there or someone who really looked like me. I was stunned –  I was never there at the pkace he talked about... but he was guessing what I had done in the past! In this moment I said ‘I have never been in that place’ (true) but I OMMITTED to tell him I had been a prostitute. Why didn’t I tell him right then?!? I think it was fear that he would judge me, I intended to tell him everything sbout myself but wanted to feel he knew me better, knew that I had long lived past those bad times. Of course it was selfidh - I didnt want to lose him,I was falling in love, wanted him to love me back.

He asked me again about this and started asking me if there were things I was hiding, he could feel there were things I was holding back. Some of his questioning was a little odd, like asking if I was a spy, or being blackmaiked... i didnt know what to make of him asking those questions...anyway I ended up telling him 4 months later (so 6 months into our relationship) about the sex work part of my past. We talked on the phone, and later in person about it. At first I felt relieved, like he didn’t judge me. His understanding strengthened my trust and love for him. BUT over the years, the more he ruminated the more he hurt and believed I’d lied, the more it seemed he did judge me. 
More than once – he said how could he be with someone who was a prostitute, he was repulsed,  I was disgusting , how could I not have told him. I sometimes thought he equated it with being promiscuous, like he couldn’t see it was not that way. I again became deeply ashamed of my past, regressed and began to get horrible flashbacks of things I thought I had left behind with therapy. I returned to counselling, for myself and as I didn’t want these things to burden him or affect our relationship.

I don’t realise for a long time but he suffers from anxiety and is autistic – looking back I wish I’d known earlier, or even vaguely understood what that meant for communication. I think knowing would have helped, like how to be specific and exacting in my words, and how people can take things and fix on ideas  (I can be pretty vague, and talk through thoughts as I’m having them sort of thing). Our communication styles caused us a few misunderstandings early on – sometimes by text - and these misunderstandings were against this backdrop of his developing the idea that I was dishonest. So innocent things looked to him: like when I got out of work 20 minutes late and he was waiting outside getting anxious, or if I changed a place to meet at the last minute. It sparked anxiety, made him feel disrespected and upset (whereas to me it was simply running late, being flexible or whatever)

And again early on, my more recent sexual / dating past came out piecemeal and clumsily. These included exchanges early in chats while texting and flirting, I mentioned the sex with the married man.. I had misunderstood the text conversation thought 'make me jelly' was make me turned on , not ""jealous""..and thought we were being risqué…titillating each other a bit. Months later he expressed hurt, shock and anger about this conversation. Since then he maintains I ‘boasted’ about sex with a married man. And the the oral sex I’d engaged in came up too. Early on in our sex life, we tried this act – in that way I mean - and I said the words “f*ck my face” (in the heat of the moment). Later, he asked me why I did that – and I had no answer, just “I don’t know”. A month or so later I had reflected on it and talked to him. I told him how it had come about, how some combination of maybe seeing that younger person, the influence of porn, trying things, underlying self-image issues – all combined, but that i did not want yo be degraded or degrading in any way. I explained how, now,  I realised it was pretty whack, not something I should have brought into our sex life. I hoped opening up would help him understand where the behaviour had come from. But He called me a ‘pervert’ down the phone. It was awful. From the time of these early months, until about 8 months in, by which time he knew everything about me – including me telling him I’d slept with a person we both knew when we thought we might see them at a party. 

Within our first year he'd decided I was dishonest, brought things up partially,  omitted the truth and took part in risky behaviour. I acknowledged ok I sometimes did - EG I mentioned an acquaintance one time, as a friend, then a few months later said actually I had slept with that person (not a person he ever met btw) and sure that could definitely be seen as partially revealing.

The risk taking acvusations I found hard too...like one time I shared a taxi from the airport for work – two businessmen sat in the back, I sat in the front with the driver – he saw this as hugely risky. I saw it as carpooling.. so I was confused on some of stuff he found objectionable. 
But there were numerous examples that seemed to feed a collage persona of me in his mind - promiscuous, oversexed, risk taker, liar..

By contrast to my past, he was in a relationship for about 14 years, had been mainly single since splitting. He’d never tried online dating – saw it as for hook-ups only. And while he didn’t sit me down early on and tell me his whole past either - eventually he shared things about himself – including that he'd had a fair few sexual partners, and had cheated several times in his long relationship. I didn’t worry as much that he told me these things later. Although yes it was bad behaviour – it was his past, I loved him in the now. And i thought - past is past ( unless it is an sti, drug abuse or some criminal charge kind of issue) 

But I did start to feel I was being unfairly judged for my past. Mainly he would say it was not the past, but the way I omitted telling details and in his view lied – he believed that was deceitful. But he also began to really focus on the past itself. And it became cruel. He called me liar all the time, called me sexually aggressive, a slut, one night he even looked up slut in the dictionary - reading me the definition to show he was accurate. 

 He  struggled to trust me – soon believing I had done things that I never did. He thought I cheated, flirted with his friends,oggled strangers.. things like that. 

No amount (and i mean the following 4 years of me apologising, crying, begging) of me acknowledging that yes, I could have talked about my past sooner, or saying sorry helped. I have been 100% loyal and faithful in my heart body and mind to him, and I love him still. I mean I hsve never thought about another man not once. And i knew that he really lost his way and I did not love how he was treating me. I hoped and hoped we coukd work it out.

Over years I’ve tried my best in many ways to show him I love him , through actions, and to rebuild trust and asking forgiveness. Being reliable with small things.. but It felt like he could not see I was sorry, or see me as the loving partner in front of him – and over time the hurt ate him up, he would get upset, angry, he wouldn’t want us to socialise together, we stsrted drinking at home every nightband just hashing over it nightbafter night - my lies, his hurt...and eventually he stopped loving me,stayed but said his feelings have changed. 

TLDR: HOW do you rebuild trust if you have not actually been unfaithgul? And WHEN should you tell your SO your sexual past? Not telling all, early, has damaged my relationship. He believes I was intentionally deceitful - as in intending to deceive him. I felt like my intentions were good but yes my opening up was far from perfect but i was not 'lieing'.We can’t seem to find a way through the mess we are in.

1iit2ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1iit2ef/recently_broken_up_and_need_answers/,Recently broken up and need answers.,"Me and my boyfriend of 4 years recenly broke up and i cant stop to spiral into questions if he was avoidant or narcicist or a mix of both or i am just being delusional.

When we first met everything was great, we spent a lot of times together and we had a lot of fun, but there was always avoiding intimacy with me. He always told me it was due to stress at work, or some family thing.  Then 3 monts into relationship i was so much in lovr and went to family vacation to another country. I have a friend there and went for coffee with him. My now ex boyfriend asked me what i was doing and i said im with friend we went for a coffee and sent him a picture. Starting that day he cheated on me. I only recently learned that he slept with many people after i sent him that picture and what surprised me is that i am trying to defend him, but if it was he was scared, he thought he i cheat and so he did it, but he did it over the course of a week, every day. I can say maybe out of anger of fear he would do that 1 night but 7 nights in a row? I felt hurt and when i was comming back from vacation all i could think was how excited i was to see him. And that day he also cheated. Next day we met abd he pretended everything was great we had a lot of fun but no intimacy. For our whole 4 years i dont think we had intimacy 2 days in a row. It is usually once a month and we are pretty young 31, and 30.

Now back to our breakup. It all started when i suggested that we open our relationship due to lack of intimacy and he denied at first , but i told him, either we work something out with or without help, either we break up, or either we open relationship. I tried to give him space and not pressure him but that never worked. I tried being more dominant which he liked with others, but then he said i molested him and i was unable to initiate anything anymore. We went to a party and he flirted with another guy in front of me and said he cant wait to get rid of me. Few months before that we started living together and I thought our situation would be better, i was romantic, pleasing supoortive of his new job. Turns out while i was at work he brought other guys to our place and had hookups while denying me intimacy. He cheated a lot, and told his friends  that he doesnt know what else to do so i would leave him. So I did. But now im spiraling, was he a narcicist, avoidant, why did he never want to talk to fix things. He always said everything is ok, we are great, he loves me and then goes and cheat. When I presented proof that he cheated he said those are all lies, photoshop etc. In the end he said i was the one that ended relationship and not him so it is my fault. After breakup i tried to talk to him again, to try to fix it but he said I love you but I just dont care about you.

1iit1g4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iit1g4/i_21f_need_advice_on_how_to_move_forward_with_him/,I (21F) need advice on how to move forward with him (26M),"For context, I am a mixed (black+white) girl from USA living in South Korea. I met a Korean guy on Bumble about 2 1/2 weeks ago and we chatted consistently before arranging a date. I want to mention that his profile was not complete and did not list what kind of connection he was seeking (ex. long term relationship, casual dates or intimacy without commitment). The first night we met, we stayed together from 5PM - 4AM, and in the two dates after that we easily spent 5+ hours together. Nothing sexual, we just talked for hours, opening up about our lives and making a genuine connection. We did karaoke and gaming at a PC cafe after coffee and dinner. 

He has done things that stood out to me such as paying for dinners / coffee, hand feeding me food, making direct eye contact, offering his scarf / coat, and asking questions to make sure I was comfortable (""are you cold?"" ""are you tired?"" ""are you hungry?""). Also, when we visited the PC cafe, there was a couple's area and he insisted we sat there together (but maybe I'm overthinking on this one). I think he enjoys my company because when we finish dinner or coffee, he always suggests we do another activity to continue our time together. We've visited multiple arcades and our 3rd date we wandered about aimlessly, just talking to each other. 

Now my issue is that, as an American girl, I'm accustomed to knowing where I stand with a man after 3 dates. By this point, usually the man will initiate physical contact (hugging, kissing, hand holding) or venture into more romantic topics. However, none of this has happened with him and I feel confused. I am very attracted to him physically and emotionally, as we are able to connect on deep levels in our conversations. He just feels safe, and I want to see if our connection can blossom into more. But I can't tell if he is being romantic or platonic with me, due to different cultural norms. 

I'm considering asking him bluntly, ""what are your intentions with me"", but I'm also afraid of scaring him away if he isn't looking for a romantic connection and I got the wrong vibe. I'm debating between being upfront and asking (I'm usually quite confident with men but he has me NERVOUS), or waiting to see if he makes the next move.

Do you think I should ask him about his intentions? Or should I wait for him? Would it come across as desperate if I admitted my attraction for him? Please help me! 

TL;DR: I'm attracted to a Korean guy that I met online. We met in person for 3 consecutive dates, hit it off, and had a great time together. But he hasn't initiated any physical contact and he doesn't flirt with me which has me confused about whether he sees me as a friend or a romantic interest. I'm considering between asking him what his intentions are with me or waiting to see if he moves our connection into a romantic territory, but I'm afraid of scaring him away if he only sees me as a friend. What do you think I should do in this situation? ",1,1738812122.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

*  Hello, good morning, afternoon or evening, dear Reddit user! Come in, you are absolutely welcome. I see you're tired; do you want a cup of coffee?

. . .

*  Oh, do you want to know about the game?

* Haha of course. Sorry, sometimes I go around the bush.

* I guess it's time to introduce you to ""Undertale Blue: Legacy"".

NOTE: We advise you to play Undertale and Undertale Yellow before this, as it contains major spoilers for both of those games.

-- A prequel made by and for fans that takes place in the Undertale Yellow and Undertale universe. You play as the 3rd human, ""Sadako"",  a teenage human girl who had the misfortune to fall immediately after Toriel had just finished checking up to see if anyone else had fallen. Without a Toriel to give you a tuToriel (Get it?) to face the challenges of the ruins, you'll have to rely on yourself to discover the mysteries that the underground hides. Surely that's all gonna end well... right?

-- Don't be afraid if you end up getting lost in the lost ruins, I'm sure you'll find the way!

*  What do you mean by ""talking flower""?

*  There aren't echo flowers in the ruins, silly!

*  We better continue!

(Yes, there's no Flowey. Lore reasons.)

-- Undertale Blue: Legacy takes into account the canon established by Undertale Yellow and tells the story of the blue soul human mentioned in said game. At this point, you're probably thinking that the game is not going to have much originality to it, right? I'm pleased to inform you that you couldn't be more wrong. The UTY canon is a starting point, yes, but not the whole story. UTB:L has its own story and its own identity, so don't be worried too much, because this game has 3 new zones and a lot to offer! (Yeah, 6 areas, wish us luck... please.)

-- Our game is a product that seeks to take the average UnderTale fan out of their comfort zone, introducing different characters than one might be accustomed to.

-- In ""UnderTale Blue: Legacy"" you will see the cruelest and dirtiest aspects of the human species portrayed. If you are looking for a fun game suitable for everyone, then this is not your game.

-- Discover new friends, enemies, bosses, routes and secrets in this fangame, play with new mechanics and have fun because this game has...

-ACTION!

-DRAMA!

-MYSTERY!

-I CAN'T SAY IT BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN EVERYTHING!

-ROMAN- WAIT WHAT?!

_*History*_
-- Long after the famous ""war between Humans and Monsters"", humans educated future generations under the guise of that war being just a medieval fantasy story, something that never happened. However, those stories shared through generations, always shared an important similarity, the war had been started by monsters, and had claimed many more lives of innocent humans than monsters.

-- And although the story was just ""fiction"", in the vast majority of cases, these stories are based on true events. Mount Ebott has always been a place full of mysteries, such as the disappearance of 2 human childs who never returned to their homes.

-- Sadako's family is a very superstitious one, who firmly believed in all the rumors that were said about Mount Ebott, and of course, the fact that there were evidence that supported these beliefs only made the situation more threatening. The girl of Japanese origin was very close to her family, and a doubt gnawed her: What could happen if the monsters ever escaped from their prison? The situation was one of fear, but also hatred. Sadako didn't want to face a situation like that, but if she had to, she would give her best.

-- Those beasts had mercilessly attacked the human kind. They didn't deserve forgiveness... Or at least that's what she believed.

(TW: SH mention)

We all have scars,

Internal, or physical.

We *can’t* escape it all



I’ll tell you about the **physical** ones, 

I’ll tell you the story behind *mine*.

And what they mean to me now.



I have a small scar on my forehead,

I cracked my head open twice,

Once falling into a ditch while learning to ride a bike without training wheels.

And another bending down to pick up a balloon and hitting my head on the corner of the wood dresser. 

*Stupid* reasons, right?



Next is my shin, 

This one is even *stupider*. 

I was hanging out with my neighbor, and he threw a piece of bark at me. 

It hit my leg, and now that’s where the scar lies.



Now, my knee.

I spilled coffee in the cafeteria, and while getting towels I slipped and dislocated my knee.

I got surgery to get the piece of cartilage that broke off of my knee.

Two small scars, about two inches apart. They had to put a camera up there, 

They gave me the pictures of it, *crazy* right?



Now I would like to talk about a large set of scars. 

They all come from the *same* thing.

I call them my *Battle Scars*.

You may at first think that they were from others,

That I *fought* others- and got these scars from *them*.

But you are *mistaken*.



These scars were *no* accident,

They were done with intention by *my own* hands.

My left arm, first done with a *freshly* sharpened **pencil**.

“*This doesn’t count*.” I told myself. “*I have to actually draw blood for it to matter.*”



Then, I got an art **knife** for christmas.

The pencil *didn’t* work anymore. I *needed* more. 

There *it* was.

The *first* drop of blood.

Sitting on the toilet, in the ***6th grade*** hallway bathroom.

  


When I forgot my knife, I turned too **candy**.

*Silly*, right?

I turned my sour drop sucker into a *sharp blade*, only with *my tongue*,

Then I *used* it. 



The scars vary.

The **pencil** ones are *dark*,

The **blade** ones are *light*. 

But still, no one noticed unless *I* told them, or they saw the *fresh* cuts.



Looking back, I *showed* the signs. 

Wearing hoodies, *even* in hot weather, *refusing* to take it off even when I stunk.

The constant *itching*.

How much I *withdrew* myself.

I showed *it*, but no one noticed unless *I* spoke.



Teachers always tell you *how* to tell the signs. 

I have sat *in class*, scars *out*.

Teachers didn’t *bat* an *eye*.



Therapists say, 

“*Whatever you say in here, stays in here.*”

But I *always* read the fine print. That’s what *trauma* does to ya.

“*Unless you have thoughts of harming yourself or others.*” is what it read.

  


I have had thoughts about *wanting* to go to a mental hospital. 

But the stereotypes would *never* leave me.

I know it’s *stupid*. 

Maybe *I’m* just *stupid*.



My children.

I tell you this because *I* was you once.

I *still* struggle, 

And *I* know how to help if you ever think that way.

You *won’t* have to worry about me sending you to someone random *immediately* after you say something.



I *will* listen. 

And if **you want** a therapist, I’ll *give* it to you. 

If **you think** a mental hospital would be the best option for you, I’ll get the paperwork *ready*.

You *never* have to tell me something you don’t want to, I get that some things are *hard* to talk about. 

But just know *I will* always be there. 



Cause even though I call those scars “*Battle Scars*”,

They’re scars I *hope* to never see on your *beautiful* body.

1iisoba,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1iisoba/i_started_a_book_club/,I started a book club!!,"Hey y’all! I’m 25 and I think I’ve averaged reading about one book a year over the last 4 years. I read more in college because I had to, but I used to be a huuuge bookworm as a kid. It’s hard to pique my interest in terms of finding a good book, but maybe I’m too quick to judge a book by its cover, or first couple pages HAHA. 

Anyway, I read this fantastic book (The Women We Become by Ann Thomas). Great read. It dives into folklore, spirituality and the stages of a woman’s life, from birth to menopause and old age, along with questions and thoughts we should be pondering for our own personal growth and harnessing the full power of our feminine energy.

I posted an excerpt from it, and an acquaintance (we met once through mutuals at a festival— haven’t hung out since but follow each other on socials) slid up on my story, and from there we started talking about books and giving each other recommendations. I asked her if she’d ever consider starting a book club, and she said she was interested! 

I was thinking about it a lot over the next few days, so I decided to create a group chat with her and a few of my other girlfriends who love reading. Everyone was super on board, so our first meeting is this Saturday at a coffee shop to discuss The Four Agreements. 

I’m über excited for multiple reasons:

1. I miss the classroom setting; the articles we read, the discussions… so it’ll be cool to use more of my brain power towards educational/dialectical purposes. My attention span is so short and I brain rot a lot and just waste time not learning/reading anything of value, and it’s time to change that.

2. Social time with women! I love my ladies, they’re so empowering. It’s gonna be so refreshing just having a good discussion with some good people. I’m looking forward to becoming friends with this acquaintance, because she doesn’t have a lot of friends that live close by and she’s just super cool. Also, one of my girlfriends invited her friend to join, so I think as time goes on, the group will grow :) and I love making new friends!! 

3. One of my goals for this year is to read more, so even if I don’t read a book on my own outside of the group, this club and our bi-weekly meetings will hold me accountable to actually still read something!! 

4. I party-hardied for 6 years and socialized a lot— I think it burnt me out. Too many substances, too many wasted breaths on people that don’t care, pretend to care, or too intoxicated to remember what was said. Maybe it’s because my prefrontal cortex is fully developed (😂😏), but this last year, everything shifted. My priorities have changed. I’m taking care of more responsibilities, taking care of myself, setting boundaries, and genuinely just enjoying my own time for hobbies and such, because I used to fill the void with friends and going out, not focusing my time and energy on myself. These days I’ve been looking toward NOT the bars and raves, but rather chill activities, like playing music, crafting, board games, and reading. This’ll be another hobby that’s chill, enriching, sober, and doesn’t break the bank.

Sorry this was so long, but I’m really proud I took the first step of putting the gears in motion, because others are interested and it’s actually happening! You gotta create your own opportunities ✌️❤️",2,1738810960.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

When you think about home decor, the kitchen might not be the first room that comes to mind. However, with the growing trend of incorporating crystal home decor into every space, kitchens are becoming a perfect avenue for adding elegance and style. Crystal decor not only enhances the visual appeal of your kitchen but also brings a range of benefits that can improve your cooking and dining experience.

One of the most striking benefits of using crystal in your kitchen decor is its ability to reflect light. Crystals catch the light beautifully, creating a sparkling effect that can brighten even the dimmest of spaces. Imagine hanging a stunning crystal pendant light above your dining table or having crystal cabinet knobs that glimmer when you open your cabinets. This added brightness can make your kitchen feel warm and inviting.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/crystal-home-decor-kitchen

- **Consider Functionality:** Always keep functionality in mind. Choose crystal items that you can use regularly, such as serving utensils or glass containers.

(Plus new donor bonus money) Using the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iism3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1iism3y/thats_a_pretty_fuckin_good_milkshake/,That's a pretty fuckin' good milkshake...,"Last night I blew off seven-eleven when I saw a Winn-Dixie behind it. I got a half a sub sandwich, a sprite, some Chibani yougurt drink for the old gut bugs, and an apple. Headed back to the seven-eleven where I spied an outlet to eat and charge. I sit down on the sidewalk. Plug my phone in. Immediately one of the workers comes out. 

""You good?"" ""Yeah man, I'm good."" ""You want a cig?"" I've got some brother. Thank you!"" He hangs on the other side of the door. I get to eating. I was craving a burger while I was setting up my tent. This will have to do. Pretty good sandwich. 

The fog rolls in thick. It's dark out by this point. 'I guess I won't have to worry much about being seen going back to camp. 😆' I finish eating.  Smoke. My phone's not charged but I'm tired. I checked my old power cell before I left. It was full. 'Close enough.' I grab my apple and what's left of my sprite. Trash in trash can. Double check I'm not leaving a mess. Out.

High stepping through tall grass through a field to get back to my spot in the trees. I marked my tent on maps just in case before I left.  Didn't need it. Back to tent. Inside tent. Update for the peeps...

Woke up today. I slept  in. Gear packed. Tent mostly dried out. Gear on. To seven-eleven. I spy a sign that says 'two slices of pizza and a soda for five bucks.' I don't really want a soda and a coffe this morning, but that's a deal I can't pass up. Go inside. 

No pizza in the holding bin. 'Fuck it. I was thinking about a breakfast burrito anyway.' Coffee. Found the last five meat cold breakfast burrito. Grabbed a couple bananas to keep my muscles from cramping up today. Paid. Microwave. Out to last night's outlet. I sit on my tripod stool and have a leisurely breakfast. Smoke. Got some charge, but not a lot. Checked for the bus from yesterday.  Bathroom. Out to bus stop. Gear down. Check time. 'Bus should be here in six minutes."" Might as well have another smoke. 

As I'm pulling a smoke out of the pack I see the bus coming. Smoke back in pack. Gear up. Bus. Get onboard. I check maps frantically to see if this bus goes up the 1 headed north. It does a little. 'Awesome! Every little bit helps!' I hit the stop cable when I'm nearing the farthest I think I can get.

Bus driver, ""Here?"" ""Are there any more stops?"" ""No, but I can drop you off when I turn."" ""Awesome man! Thank you!"" ""No problem."" We head another few miles up the way I'm going. Turn. He lets me out. ""You've been a huge help. Thank you very much!"" "" No problem.  Have a good day!"" ""You too! Thanks again!"" Out of bus with gear on. Water jug in hand. Across intersection. Find a good spot for cars to pull over. Gear down. Thumb out. Smoke lit. I always check the time because a lot of people ask how long I've been there when they pick me up. And it's good to know how things are going. Some cars go by. Some more cars go by. This is my favorite kind of spot. Steady traffic, but slow enough I can put my arm down and rest in between groups of cars.

I see a car pull into the motel I'm on the edge of. Turns through the parking lot to the entrance closest to me. Leans over so I can see him. Waves me over. ""Where you going?"" ""Up to the 528 and then west."" ""I'll get you up there. Hop on in. Been there."" Gear up. Gear in car. Me in car. I check his clock. 'Fifteen minutes. Not bad!"" From gear down to in his car.  

He's got a really high IQ too. Physics and Economics major. We have a great chat. He takes me about 15 miles down the 528. Drops me off. At a travel center. My sincere thanks. We trade numbers. ""If you get into any trouble or you need anything, call me."" ""Thanks bro! I appreciate it!""

Gear up. Walk about half a mile to the end of random shops. 'This spot looks good.' I check maps. Realize I'm on a road south of 528. The 520. Scramble to rewrite my itinerary so I know where I'm gong at a glance, and don't have to burn my limited data and battery to see where I'm turning next. Gear down. Check time. Smoke. Thumb out. Cars go by for a while.

I see a car do a u-turn right in front of me aroun the median. Pulls over. A woman about my age. "" Hop on in. Where you going?"" ""Down this road until it hits the 4."" ""Holy shit! Well I can take you as far as I can take you. I'm going to the 50."" ""Awesome! Every bit helps. You can just drop me on this road wherever you turn off."" ""Ok. Put your stuff in the back. Gear in. Me in. We tell stories about getting in fights. It turns out she's a 'fight fire with fire' type to. We laugh a lot. Crack some jokes. I look at maps to see where the 50 is.

This 520 I'm on runs right into the 528 I originally wanted. 'No need to rewrite my itinerary. Fuckin' maps. 😆"" The 50 is gonna run me through the middle of downtown Orlando. Fuck. That. Nothing worse in my experience than hitchhiking through a big city. (Ymmv.) I tell her she can drop me on the 528 when we hit it. ""Ok. Yeah you don't want to go through the shit."" ""Nope. Fuck all that."" From the time I dropped my gear until the time I got in her car... fifteen minutes. 

I had a butterfly stop me in my tracks on my out of the field I camped in last night. Butterflies are my friends.  Always have been. When I see one it's my sign that I'm on the right path and on the right rhythm. I have had hundreds over the years stay a few feet in front of me while walking somewhere. When I've had caterpillars on my tent when it's cocoon season, I will spend whatever time it takes to gently put them in a better place so they can get to being butterflies. I started a job a day late once for a customer of mine because of it. (She was tickled to death when I told her why.) I have never had one stop me before. This one did. I figure it was holding me up so cars could clear out of the road I was approaching and slow me down just enough to get me on the right rhythm. (You see how my day is going so far, right 😁)

I walk  over to the 528 from where Sandy dropped me off. It was a decent length ride. Gear down. Smoke lit. Thumb out. Finish smoke a car pulls over. A WRX with a 2.5L Sti motor in it. We hit the 528. Dude tells me to hold on. This assures me he's taking things seriously. And not just fucking  around like some kid being dangerous. He punches it. We fucking flew! It was awesome! I haven't had a good fast ride in years. Totally safe. Fuckin' movin'!!! We talk about the car for a bit he drops me before an interchange where he's going south after a while. 

I walk about a mile down the 528 to the other side of the interchange where I can catch the most traffic. Gear down. Smoke lit. Thumb out. People driving by. Some waves. Some short honks. A few with their phones out filming me that I wanted to flip off. I didn't.  That angry guy in Mississippi a while back is still etched in my mind. I was there for an hour. Not horrible, but I'm definitely catching traffic coming out of Orlando. Nobody is stopping. A car finally slows down.

This dude stops in the lane about a thousand feet from me. I give him the hands out 'What""s up dude?' Gesture. He just sits there. I'm not picking my gear up and hauling  ass for a guy stopped in the lane a thousand feet away.  If he pulls over, fine. I'll go. But he's quite a bit farther than my limit for picking my gear up. I've had enough people drive off after doing that very same thing after I haul my gear up to their car. No more. He slowly starts to move forward again. 'Yeah, fuck that. If you're not smart enough to act right in this situation I'll wait for the next one. Another hour goes by.

An older Cuban guy pulls over. Gets out. Pops his trunk. Gear in. Brief talk about where I'm going. A bit of a language barrier, but we're communicating ok. He tells me he was a preacher in Cuba for twenty years. He's now a cab driver. He runs me up past the airport.  I get out early because I didn't know exactly where I was. I haul my gear a solid mile to a gas station. Gear down. Stretch. Sit on a curb Check maps.

'I can get to the 4 on a bus. And there's a walmart right there! Sweet! I'll be out of Orlando and in the country from there out. My kinda hitchhiking.' I don't know if there'll be a place to get smokes there. I'm running low. I'm not taking any chances. Gear up. Inside. Get smokes. Have dude break a five so I can catch the bus. Down the road. Bus stop.

Two buses and a sunset later I get off the bus at walmart. The thought of another cold sandwich is less than appealing. Can't do it. If I have my choice of fast food for a burger I'm going to Wendy's. Right in front of me is... a Wendy's! 'Fuck yeah. That settles that.' I don't wanna spend the cash this is gonna take, but you gotta keep the old body happy when it's craving something. A baconator meal with an orange soda later... I'm using my old phone because it's charged and their wifi. A little reddit while I eat. My almost dead phone with service beeps. A text.

It's dude who house I'm going to. He's going right through where I'm at tomorrow on a mission for something.  I tell him where I'm at and to get a hold of me if he wants to pick me up in the morning. Still waiting on a reply...

It's against my religion to set an alarm while I'm hitchhiking. I may do it anyway. I'm sure I'll hear from him later tonight.

I'm currently sitting outside the walmart using my old no service phone to write this while my other phone and power cell are charging at the only working plug on this building. Gear one one my left. Me on my tripod stool. Charging stuff and water jug on my right. It's 8:35. I think I might bounce into walmart and grab some dessert. I'm craving sugar a little.

While I'm proofreading this for spelling mistakes. My other phone beeps. Its dude. He'll pick me up here on his way back tomorrow.Awesome! I'm gonna hang here. It looks like he's coming right through here. He's got the address. Everything I might need tomorrow for the wait is right here.

A question occurred to me while I was on the long wait...
Why don't van lifers pick up hitchhikers? I get the rich ones in the expensive vans with the $100,000 dollar build-out. But the rest? We're both travelers. I don't want anything from you other than a ride. If we hit it off I can contribute to a cool camping trip for a night. I don't get it. Just a thought...",31,1738810791.0,vagabond,4,0.97,False

The small gesture of giving me three packets of biscoff cookies because I expressed that I really liked them in coffee didn’t go unnoticed either. This event is so tragic, and you guys have been holding your heads high, even when you have every right to quit the profession. 

I may have flight anxiety for the rest of my life that may also require medication, but having a kind and professional FA crew and pilot crew really, really helped. ",12,1738810658.0,americanairlines,2,0.93,False

Do you remember Utah? While I can look back and see tons of red flags from me, do you have any fond memories with me? Do you remember the Nepalese restaurant? Coffee in Park City? Waking up next to each other for the first time?

Do you remember Kansas? Remember how scared and angry I was because of my stupid (at the time) boss? Do you remember how kind, loving, and sweet you were to me? Remember getting a wild hair and going to get authentic Mexican food at midnight, then sitting in the car in a random parking lot enjoying it? I swear we laughed for hours...

Do you remember Queens? Remember the people banging on the walls that first night? Remember the pizza at 2am? Remember when I was offered millions of dollars for us to start our business, all of which I fucked up before getting?

I remember every smile, every kiss, every glance. I remember how much fucking fun it was to life with you. I know it sucked sometimes, I know that I was dishonest and indecisive, never wanting to tell anyone ""no"".

The universe gave me a single chance to have you as mine, literally. When she lost her mind that morning... and I later started the separation process... for whatever reason i panicked and i was frozen, trapped by family dynamics.

There's still so much that you don't know. I don't think you'd care, but it's the unfairness that's my problem. 

When you two joined forces at the end, she wasn't honest with you. But I had no way to tell you that. I was caught, I was stuck, and soon after, my whole world crumbled to nothing. A horrible villain, and the perfect scapegoat. 

You know that, though, don't you? People in my field knew private things about me, about us, that no one else did. I was honest with them all; I stopped lying the day you threw your hat on my floor and walked out. They asked me about my infidelity - some true and some fabrication - yet things that could have only come from you and her.

I owned up to it.... Just like when she asked me if truly loved you, and with tears and confidence I said ""yes, more than anyone, ever."" 

You had the right to ruin my name, but you didn't have to. I did deserve the scorn and pain for the things that were true. But there were lies stuffed in as well, and that isn't okay. 

You knew that we were evicted, didn't you? The kids and I, homeless for a bit?

You knew that I moved two thousand miles away because I couldn't get a job anywhere close to home, thanks to what y'all did, don't you? 

You knew that I was living in homeless shelters in New England, then living out of my car once the separation was official, right?

You knew that she was cheating, didn't you? I didn't deserve any heads up or any help from you, and I picture you with a smile on your face when you learned. I don't blame you, I would have done the same thing. 

Did you know that all I wanted was to apologize to you, properly, but you told me to never ever talk to you again?

Did you know that, for over two years, I've begged every god, every energy that I imagined could even possibly exist for one chance to apologize to you?

Did you know that I'm in a better place than I've ever been in my career, in my physical and emotional fitness, and in my spiritual practice?

Did you know that, even with no friends left in my life and no family left alive, that I'm stronger than ever? 

I don't expect you to care, as you have the right not to. I know you'll never read this, but on this flight home, every stupid thing reminds me of you... your hand in mine, first class every time. Trolling drunk assholes because we could. Making sigils for fun. Kissing because we were together.

I am wanting to upgrade my PC. It is mainly used for playing wow, and lots of multitasking/working from home. My goal with the upgrade would be the ability to run everything on ultra settings; while other programs may be running. (Firefox, Netflix, other random things at any given time.)

I feel like the 3060 has a hard time with the 1440p monitor, so do I get an i7, faster/more ram and a 4070? Or get 5800x3d/7800x3d, motherboard, ram, and keep the 3060 and get a new monitor(1080p)?

Money *is* an issue, so obviously the most affordable way to get the most performance is what I'm trying to figure out. Also being able to support 2-3 monitors.

Thank you for any advice or opinions.

1iishl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1iishl9/im_really_confused_but_also_embarrassed/,"I’m really confused, but also embarrassed.","

I have a bit of a unique situation, since my MIL has a very valid reason to disapprove of me, but I am still really hurt and concerned that she’s poisoning my partner against me and generally causing stress in both of our lives. 

I (28F) and my boyfriend (27M) have been together for about 1.5 years and living together for most of it. Boyfriend has an excellent career, but I am years delayed on my advanced degree and only recently started working part-time while I try to finish my thesis. I come from a relatively privileged family, with parents who graciously allow me to use their money to buy groceries and home necessities. I am humiliated by my circumstances and am acutely aware of my failures, but I want to clarify that while boyfriend works and pays the rent on the apartment he was already living in, I am not a financial burden and I don’t leech off of him: I’ve taken over almost all of the housework since moving in, and I do more than 95% of the grocery shopping (albeit with my family’s money). I prepare at least two homemade meals a day for boyfriend, whereas before I entered the picture, he was ordering takeout all the time. In other words, I’ve been a homemaker, all while trying to better myself, further my education, and cope with the intense shame of having failed to fully launch as an adult. Also, boyfriend is autistic and has bipolar 1 disorder, so it took me awhile for me to understand his quirks and get through to him, which took and continues to take a lot of emotional labor. Boyfriend often tells me that I literally keep him sane, which he means as a compliment, but it also means that there is pressure on me to help manage his mental health in addition to everything else in my life. 

Some important context: Since the *very* start of our relationship, even before boyfriend and I became a couple, I made it clear to boyfriend that I was marriage-minded, and that I would leave a relationship after 2 years if I weren’t engaged by that point. At the time, I didn’t know that I’d still be this far behind in my schooling/career, but for various reasons, I maintain that I cannot stay in a relationship for longer than two years if a partner does not propose. I have always been transparent about this, and as I struggled to make progress on my thesis but continued to develop our relationship, I reminded boyfriend of my boundary. I told him that I didn’t think I’d have a serious job anytime soon and that he should let me know ASAP if this would prevent him from committing to me within two years. I have never hidden my struggles from him or from anyone else for that matter, because I never want to misrepresent myself as better than I actually am. People often tell me “fake it til you make it,” but I just don’t think that’s genuine. 

Regarding MIL, I noticed red flags since the beginning: a few weeks into our relationship, boyfriend made a very poor decision that hurt me terribly, and I left him for it. Within three hours, I got a call from boyfriend’s mom, whom he’d told about me only after I left, begging me to talk to boyfriend because he was “in a really bad place.” (Boyfriend hadn’t asked her to reach out to me on his behalf, but she insisted that he give her my number.) I knew that this was strange behavior, but I did what MIL asked because I could tell she was panicking. I ultimately ended up back with boyfriend. While on the phone with me that day, MIL mentioned being impressed by how well I understood boyfriend and by my compassion toward such a unique person, so it seemed that her initial impression of me was positive.  

A few weeks after that, still before meeting boyfriend’s mom IRL, boyfriend contracted a stomach bug. Again, his mom called me, giving me precise instructions on how to take care of him as if I was his nurse. Weeks after that, I first met MIL in person (she lives a few hours’ flight away), and she became even more overbearing. She told me that “if you are going to date my son, you are NOT ALLOWED to drink diet soda anymore.” There was also a strange moment once when he happened to lie down on a bed in front of her: she started rubbing his whole body and told me “this is what he needs; you have to rub his whole body like this.” It wasn’t sexual or overtly inappropriate, but I was uncomfortable. 

At first, I attributed all of MIL’s protectiveness to her having raised an autistic son who later developed a serious psychiatric condition. She’d occasionally reach out to me asking me to put certain supplements into his coffee (I told her I would do it only with his consent), make me swear to buy only organic food (again, neither she nor boyfriend was paying our grocery bill, but I knew it was important to her, so I often indulged her), and telling me to abandon the pescetarian lifestyle I’ve followed since I was a preteen because “grass-fed steaks are so healthy.”

MIL has visited boyfriend’s apartment only once since I moved in. (She went through our pantry, scolding me for all the “poison” I kept in it and telling boyfriend that certain food items are “killing” him.) Usually, though, we visit her, and while we’re there, she often comes into the guest room and makes snarky comments about how messy I am (just to be clear, I always clean up thoroughly before we leave, and I’m not dirty, just disorganized. As a point of pride, I leave the room cleaner than it was when we arrived, but MIL doesn’t like that I leave my clothes in bags on the floor, for example. I feel she shouldn’t be entering the room for privacy reasons). When we’re visiting in person, she tells me I’ve gained weight and drops passive-aggressive comments such as how I’m “unhealthy and influencing my son to be unhealthy too.”

Months ago, I asked boyfriend to gently break the news to his mom that we may be getting engaged soon. I suspected that she’d react poorly, because she is anti-marriage in general (everyone in his family has been divorced at least once; on the other hand, no one in my family has ever been divorced, and I don’t plan on being the first), but also because her attitude toward me has grown colder over time. He didn’t do so before prior to our most recent visit as I would have liked; instead, he told her when I was out of earshot while we were staying at her house, and she blew up, as I’d expected. Unfortunately, this meant that while I was not actually involved in the conversation, I had to stay in her house during those days of tension (boyfriend wanted to get a hotel for the last few days of our visit, but I told him that was a waste of money and that it would only worsen things). At the request of boyfriend’s grandma (MIL’s mom, whom I love), who called us and said MIL had been crying to her, I approached MIL right before we flew home and acknowledged all of her concerns. I told her I appreciate how much she loves boyfriend and that she’s concerned for him. I told her I respect her and that I’d never tell a mother not to worry about her child, and that I understood all her hesitations about me. I told her that I’m working on myself, my career, and my weight, and we hugged it out for the most part, or so I thought. 

When we got home, things got worse. MIL started shit-talking me to boyfriend’s other family members and via text/call to boyfriend. Now, she heavily implied that I’m an emotional drain on boyfriend. She complained about my sexuality (I’m bi but strongly prefer men) and said that I should be dating a woman. She told boyfriend that I’m after his money, which actually made me laugh out loud since I have never asked boyfriend for anything and don’t need to; in fact, I’m always asking him not to spend money on me. And despite telling boyfriend she’d stop with all the negativity (he called her a few weeks after we returned to try to resolve things; he said that during that call, she told him she hadn’t been able to sleep for weeks and that she was crying all the time), she recently sent him an article on “how to tell if your partner is a narcissist.” She also (very wrongly lol) thought that I was boyfriend’s first sexual partner. It appears that she’s created this narrative of me as a villainous manipulator who defiled her sweet innocent boy, and that she’s been actually crying about it to boyfriend and his family. I am no great catch, but the degree to which I’ve been scapegoated and blamed by MIL for all of this is genuinely baffling. 

Boyfriends has admitted to me that his mom’s words have had influence on him, and I’ve felt it in the way his attitudes toward commitment seem to have shifted since the blowup. Another very serious issue is that boyfriend’s mood now changes every time MIL texts him regardless of the topic; he is on edge with her no matter what she talks about, and I can sometimes tell when she texts him based on his affect. Because boyfriend is BP1, his mood changes can be concerning. But I’ve been trying to let the situation defuse, so if I were to ask boyfriend “is this sour mood because your mom texted you” every time he frowns, it’d be exhausting for both of us. On the other hand, it would be weird if boyfriend announced it to me every time his mom reaches out. And even when MIL does say something negative about me, boyfriend doesn’t want to tell me because he knows it’ll upset me. This whole situation makes me feel distant from my partner: boyfriend feels like he can’t talk to me about this; I feel like I can’t ask so I’m left in the dark about what’s happening with both his mom and his mood; and I’m uncomfortable knowing that the negative messaging from MIL does get into his head. 

I have suggested to boyfriend that the next time MIL says something negative about me, he should reply with “You agreed to stop talking about [me] like this. If this continues, I’m going to need to take some space in the future.” He doesn’t want to do this, because he thinks it’ll make his mom upset, and I can’t insist, because I don’t actually want to create distance from his mom. Years ago, I was in an emotionally abusive relationship but didn’t know it, and the support of my family was what got me through. I don’t think I’m a bad partner to boyfriend, but bad partners don’t usually recognize that they’re bad, right? In other words, I don’t want to ruin that checks-and-balances system that family can provide, but I’m also worried that MIL’s concerns (aside from the career one, which I know is huge) are completely unfounded and only serve to push me and boyfriend apart. I’m concerned that if I keep pressing boyfriend to set boundaries, it’ll be for selfish reasons and not purely because MIL genuinely stresses boyfriend out in general these days. 

One last bit of info: Before I’d even met boyfriend, MIL had become convinced that medications are “poison” and tried to convince him to stop taking his mood stabilizer while he was briefly staying with her to recover from a manic episode after being institutionalized. He stopped his meds cold-turkey at his mom’s advice, and just a few days later, he relapsed into mania and was hospitalized again. Despite this, years later, MIL continues to pester boyfriend to stop taking his meds whenever she gets the chance. So boyfriend and I understand that most of her opinions may need to be taken with caution, but because I don’t yet have a career, I recognize that at least one of her concerns is legitimate. Still, my therapist says boyfriend’s mom should be thrilled that he found someone who accepts a bipolar partner, and for what it’s worth, boyfriend’s therapist apparently loves me. Meanwhile, I feel humiliated that I can’t seem to finish my degree and launch my career, ashamed of and grateful for my parents’ generosity, and occasionally upset that amid all this, the things I do offer — stability, help with mental health, [my parents’] grocery money, and all the hours I spend every single day doing homemaker duties to ensure I’m carrying some financial weight are overshadowed by what my partner feels is the ONLY thing wrong with our relationship. 

TL;DR: I am a tremendously flawed person and I recognize that openly, but MIL has villainized me in at least some ways that are unfair. Also, she raises my bf’s blood pressure while accusing me of being an emotional drain and I don’t know how to address this. ",2,1738810405.0,JUSTNOMIL,11,1.0,False

When he lived in my town we used to chat frequently with an equal back and forth, and we grew close. We'd also hang out together a lot. Now he lives in another state, doing a highly specialized training, and told me once he didn't like it there and couldn't wait to come back to my town, he's also very overwhelmed with work, writing a dissertation, and looking for another job.

Once he told me while in the beginning of his training: ""I feel like I can't confide in you without being judged. Or that when I try to talk about my life it somehow turns into a conversation about you. Which is fine, I care about you a lot and want to support you. But I don't feel like I can be emotionally open or vulnerable with you."" Now he's ""busy with work"" but I see him online sometimes, presumably chatting with others.

That previous comment hurt because I didn't feel it was true. My other friends said I'm pretty easy to open up to, and they didn't agree with his assessment either. I'm afraid if I call him out on it, he'll stop being my friend. He does have good moments, just is very avoidant, especially when overwhelmed.

Just to give context of the good moments, when my dad was really sick and couldn't come to a musical performance of mine, my friend stepped in to help with logistics, and asked how he was doing later. He is generally empathetic, kind, sometimes buys me coffee/dessert for fun (I try to return the favor too), and helped me move apartments. I helped him cat sit a few times, and we'd do a lot of mutual interest activities like outdoor-related and music stuff.

Anyway, any advice on what to say, if anything especially to the vulnerability comment? Or should I just give him space until things get better for him life-wise? He just seems like a changed person.

Edit: I do tend to be a huge texter, and I have only recently begun to curb that habit. I now only send 1 maybe 2 short texts before receiving a response from friends. For a person like him, he gets overwhelmed easily by my texting habits. So maybe space is the answer? not sure. ",2,1738809687.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

**2 Year Post-Divorce Update in 2022:**

**Bottom Line Up Front:** I'm loving life and have never had a single thought of regret regarding my divorce. I have a smart, kind, affectionate, beautiful, very physically fit girlfriend, and...she has a very high sex drive! I feel like I won the lottery!

You can read my first two posts to get the background on my story.

My ex is a very good woman, and I wish her well, but I never think of her unless someone brings her name up. I've only been divorced two years, but I was essentially alone for more than 25 years of a 36-year marriage. Many people here will understand exactly what I mean by that statement.

As you've read in my first two updates, I had a lot of fun times while reentering the world of dating. Met some very good women and was sexually active with several of them.

For those who might think they are too old to get back to dating, don't believe that for one minute.

There are countless men and women out here looking for a decent person to have a relationship with.

3 years ago, I was miserable and lonely. I thought I was going to live the rest of my life like that.

2 years ago, I was newly divorced and it felt great to finally be out of a loveless marriage. I was excited about the prospect of meeting some nice women, and I did just that, within a week of my divorce date.

1 year ago, I was having the time of my life. I was feeling great and had dated several nice women. All of my ""sexual starvation"" had been taken care of, and I found myself starting to desire a more steady relationship.

I found my current girlfriend on an online dating site, and right from our first coffee date, we both knew we liked each other. Soon, we were spending a lot of time together and after a few weeks, we became sexually intimate.

I've been dating her exclusively for over a year now, and I marvel at how compatible we are in every way. I think I'm going to end up spending the rest of my life with her.

**3 Year Post-Divorce Update in 2023:**

**Bottom Line Up Front:** I'm still with the same woman I met on a dating site in the summer of 2021.

It's been 2.5 years of happiness, fun, love and non-stop affection and sexual intimacy!

I hope you can tell how happy I am right now.

You can be happy, too...if you reflect upon your situation and muster the courage to take action.

I'm so glad that I did!

Good Luck to All!

**4 Year Post-Divorce Update Published February 2025**  
  
I am still with my girlfriend...it's been 3.5 years now with her and all continues to go well. She's a great woman and we are compatible in every way. 

We are still very active sexually, rarely going more than 2-3 days without having a good session. We are both gym rats and are in very good physical condition (she still fits her high school clothes); both of us have very high libidos and sex is a big part of our lives.

She's about to move in with me, and we are both ready for this big step. I'm pretty sure I will spend the rest of my life with her.

As stated in previous updates, I am so glad that I finally had the courage to end my marriage. I shudder to think how close I was to resigning myself to living the rest of my life in a miserable marriage that had zero intimacy and affection.

I hope my experience gives others some hope that their lives can also get better if they take action.

Ive taken it for 1 1/2 months and around a month in I started my day by drinking a coffee (which was my time since I started the medication) I felt fine but later in the evening I drank another coffee and developed severe symptoms of nausea, labored breathing, diarrhea, and shivers. I tried to get better myself but ended up in the ER where they gave me an IV and some nausea medication that didnt really help. They also told me my liver enzymes were elevated but nothing too concerning. I went back home and slowly ate a little bit of eggs and went to bed. I felt better for 4 days and thought I was back to normal and during those 4 days I started taking my medication again.
After 4 days I had like half a coffee because I thought I was better. Later that day I felt the same exact way I ended up going to the ER where they told me that I probably had something viral and I should just wait it out. I suffered for 5 days of severe nausea and just overall malice. During this time I stopped taking my meds. I got better and was better for a whole week and started taking my meds again. I really don’t know what i was thinking but i had like 1/4 a coffee and it has hit me again and only now did I think that maybe it could be something to do with my medication so I stopped taking it and I’m waiting it out just trying to handle my symptoms. Im in nursing school and really don’t want this to be something serious.

Anyone else gone through something similar?

The kitchen in the house I inherited (a 1960s bungalow) doesn't work for me and it's very small (approximately 9X10 feet).

The last time it was redone was at the end of the 1970s (circa 1979 by my parents).

Pic 1 is the kitchen as it is

Pic 2 is my hand drawn sketched idea of how to make it work

I am not open concepting it

Here's a list  of intended changes to accompany the picture of my sketch in case it isn't very clear what I was trying to illustrate.

Remove closet by front door and have the stairs open up beside the front door.

https://preview.redd.it/do70hggslfhe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b89536446902738d12e631dc4f410b998a92f5cb

Close off one of the 3 doors into the kitchen (the one you enter in from off the stairs because approximately 3 feet from it is a second door the front door and I believe the stairs originally opened to there and the closet was probably added in the 60s).

Have the work space laid out as a L (I may or may not need to change the window to be slightly smaller to accommodate cupboards better).

On the other wall across from the L a counter with uppers fur extra prep and stage (and for a designated spot to put the toaster coffee maker etc) because there isn't enough counter or cupboard space right now and my family members make do of a rolling table inserted near the sink doesn't work because the cutlery drawer can't open all the way.

I may or may not move one of the other doors to have it directly across from the from door and that kitchen doorway.

Please give me feedback back and suggestions m. I hate the way the kitchen is currently (& always have) but now it's mine and I'm free to change what doesn't work for me.

i (21) lost my grandmother (64) two days ago. im really not doing well and im absolutely eat up with guilt and pain and just need to talk about it, advice is welcome

my grandparents took me in when i was 6 and they pretty much raised me. my grandma was always like my mom and she was my closest guardian figure, even after my actual mother came back into our lives to take care of them as they got old and sick. my grandpa died about three years ago (8/2/22), and even though that hurt, he had been in hospice for chf and we had anticipated it. but yesterday morning as i was going downstairs to leave for work around 7:20 am, i found my grandma lying dead on her bed. id heard her saying my name and i thought she probably just wanted me to let the dog out or get her her inhaler (she woke me up at 2 am that morning for that exact thing, nothing was out of the ordinary, i asked her if she could get to her phone to call me if she needed me and she said yes and to go back to bed). but i think she was calling for help and i just wasn't fast enough. it went dead silent as i was going down the stairs throwing my shirt on and when i got in there to see what she wanted she was dead. 

she slept in the living room so we could all get to her if she needed something, and she was in a wheel chair so she needed to be able to move around easily from the living room to the kitchen/dining. 

just two weeks ago she went to the er for chest pain that she thought was a heart attack but wasn't. they said she probably just had bronchitis and the pain was leftover inflammation from the pneumonia. they put her on some meds and wanted to keep her for observation but her insurance wouldn't cover it so she declined and went home. she got a little better and was mobile, still hurting sometimes but up and about and doing all of her usual stuff (letting the dogs out, making herself coffee, cleaning where she could, etc). she hated feeling totally bedbound and always tried to find something to keep herself busy with. she bought herself like 100$ of currency in the object search game she loved to play two days before she died. the last time anyone saw her alive was my mom when she went up to let her dog out at 6 am.

everything hurts. we think she had a major heart attack from the pain she was in. i just keep imagining her alone and afraid and trying to call out for me, awake and aware she was dying and i was just too fucking slow to get there and she couldn't yell loud enough to wake me up before my alarm went off. knowing that she was calling me for help and thought i couldn't hear her or was asleep. knowing that the last thing she ever said was my name. i feel like if i had heard her before or gotten down quicker i could have helped her calm down or given her her inhaler or something and she would have been fine. i would have never imagined the ""love you, goodnight"" at 2 am would have been the last thing we ever said to each other. 

it feels so sudden and jarring. i loved her so much and she meant so much to us all. hearing my mom screaming and begging her to wake up after i ran to the basement to get her was awful. it was horrible and it's all so fresh in my mind. every time i think about it i just want to puke. her bed and all of her stuff and her wheel chair are still in her ""spot"" in the living room and every time i look at it it feels so wrong, she should be there and she isn't. it wasn't supposed to happen like this and i just don't know what to do. i kinda just needed to put this somewhere, sorry that it's long. im a mess!!!",1,1738809447.0,GriefSupport,3,1.0,False

Most machines need 15+ bar pressure for good espresso. Budget picks like De'Longhi use 15-bar systems, while pricier models go to 20-bar for better flavor. Pod machines (like Nespresso) trade customization for speed.  

**Key Tip:** Always use fresh beans. Grind right before brewing for maximum flavor.  

Need silky foam? Steam wands work best with whole milk, but alternatives like oat milk need patience. Lower-fat milks froth faster but collapse quicker.  

Machines under $150 can make real espresso. Spend more for temperature control and durability. Manual models require practice, but taste better than pod systems.  

Looking for fast results? Choose Nespresso. Want to master latte art? Try the CASABREWS. Short on counter space? The Stilosa or Spacekey won’t crowd your kitchen.  

Upfront cost seems high, but these machines save money vs daily café trips.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

We are all different and our bodies don't agree with some types of food, or we just don't produce the enzymes required to decompose certain foods.

I believe what happens is, we consume food we are not supposed to, quite often. This food then stays stuck inside our intestines causing blockage and disturbing our gut bacteria. 

That causes gasses, which causes GERD, SIBO, Helicobacter Pylori overgrowth, excess of mocus back of the throat,(Can change from person to person)... Then all that ""bad bacteria"" gets into some people's lungs (that's why some people have room filing bad breath just from breathing). It also gets into the nose causing post nasal drip, gets into the tonsils causing tonsil stones and into the gums causing periodontal diseases or bad smell inside gums.

Who from here have done a food intolerance and allergy test, changed their diet and still have bad breath???

I think doing tests to find out bacteria imbalances are good but we need to find the root cause, and I'm almost sure it's the diet as we keep consuming food we can't digest unknowingly.

In my case, I followed the advice from some people in this group and started taking oral prebiotics and kefir. I then had the worst fecal breath you can imagine.

Now, I have stopped dairy, black tea and coffee and changed it for Peppermint tea with Moringa powder in the morning.

My breath has improved considerably, my partner hasn't open the windows in the car and when I drink from a glass I can't smell anything on it (every glass I drank from smelled bad after a few sips).

Second date was her friends birthday party. Fun.

Third date was coffee.

Fourth date bar trivia again. Made out after.

Fifth date was another of her friend’s birthday party. Same “group” as before. She said her friends loved me. We went back to her house and made out, and she made it very clear she didn’t want to hook up yet and really appreciated me respecting that.

1iirv3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1iirv3u/aio_my_friend_asked_my_coworker_if_she_got/,AIO My friend asked my coworker if she got plastic surgery,"2 months ago, my(M20) coworker(F22) came back from a recent trip in Korea. It was obvious that she got work done on her face, but out of respect, everyone at my workplace did not mention it. I thought this was given, not talking about someone’s procedure in front of them. A few days later, I asked a close friend that frequents my workplace (I work in a coffee shop) whether he noticed anything different about my coworker and I told him that I think she got work done. (I realize now, this is where I went wrong. I should’ve honestly just kept it to myself.) 

A week after, he proceeded to go up to my coworker and asked,

“Did you get plastic surgery? Yeah my friend told me but I can’t really tell” 

I got pretty upset, but given my initial mistake of not keeping that information confidential in the first place, I figured there was myself to blame as well. Was my initial outrage unjustified? Is it ever okay to ask someone you’re not close with if they got work done? 

(Current situation: My friend doesn’t think there was anything wrong, he thinks it was an innocent question. I have an unread message from my coworker asking if I told my friend that she got work done. I don’t know how to reply.)",2,1738808489.0,AmIOverreacting,6,0.67,False

1iirrjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1iirrjs/wrote_second_person_pov_about_how_i_feel/,"Wrote Second Person POV about how I feel, wondering if anyone feels the same.","This is a bit dramatic but it was easier to get this feelings out when writing in second person, and I was wondering if anyone felt similarly. Feel a bit embarrassed, so if no one answers, oh well anyways. Also might be a bit confusing because thoughts are confusing.

It felt like an emptiness in her stomach; a blankness in her eyes. The world was quietly conscious around her, barely breathing. It lived in slow-motion, painstaking step by step. The only feelings in the world right now was the clawing ache in her stomach and the deep self-loathing in her head. 

Nothing felt like everything and everything felt like nothing. Why did she have to act this way? Why did no one love her? Why can’t she do anything right and be so useless? And the girls in her classes were smiling and talking and joking, but when she sat alone they ignored her and sat together afar. But if there was a thought to keep her going it was that firstly, they were bad friends and she should have higher standards, but secondly, that even if so, they did not owe her anything and were barely acquaintances. But she still wanted to talk to someone so she had to. So why did it hurt so much? Because when she sat alone at that desk and her teacher looked at her pityingly and she desperately wanted to scream I have friends! I have friends! But the aching loneliness inside her and the empty spot beside her stripped away the ugly truth. She was unlovable. She always had trouble with people, despite trying, despite a never ending constant effort. She hated herself and she hated her body and wished she had been different and was subject to the cruel unyielding truth that she never would be.

She tried to fight it. The ever-lasting loneliness.

When her friend apologized for being distant; when she talked to a classmate after making coffee; when she called a friend who picked up; when a girl she once knew tried to reach out. But these moments of happiness, of belonging, seemed to be tiny seconds in a never-ending tide of loneliness, and self-hatred, and loathing, and friends who would ignore her and talk to someone else; or would not show up to lunch; or stop talking to you; or pretend you don’t exist when you’ve never done anything wrong. And every time you reached out and heard a maybe that really meant like never; or a quiet when you spoke once and the conversation petered out; or when you desperately tried to make connections but hit a wall; or they wouldn’t reach back, and it’s always you reaching. You are trying. And they are not trying. It doesn’t stop and you don’t stop because you’re afraid you’ll end up lonely and friendless and have no good experiences and try to chase away that loneliness with a stick that keeps breaking but despite 

The bad experiences.

The friends who ignore you.

The desperate reaching.

You don’t stop because 

What can you do?

You don’t want to be alone. 

You just want to be liked.

But something is wrong with you.

And you can’t stop because then where will you be?

And you have to endure even though you want to cry and scream and ask why no one likes you and there’s no answer when you yell into the void because the only people that can answer this are the ones in their casual cruelty are hurting you.

And you just.

Want to cry.

1iirr1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iirr1u/how_my_quest_for_the_perfect_roast_became_crowd/,How My Quest for the Perfect Roast Became Crowd Sourced,"Hey everyone,

I've been pulling espresso at home for close to ten years now. Over this decade I've ebbed and flowed between small batch roasters and big store bags. This comes with a big gamble every time, especially the latter.

Picking up a bag that you've never tasted before could be an amazing experience or completely trash. It's those times that it's been trash that really puts a damper on the day. What's worse is that (if you're like me) you need to finish that bag of beans before buying the next. Money is too tight these days to buy some coffee just to throw it away.

So after some brainstorming I started a website for crowd sourcing coffee bean rating called RoastQuest.com. No account needed. Just submit your favorite (and least favorite) beans and scroll through the list to find what may become your next coffee bean of choice.

Features:
* Simple 5-star rating system
* No account required
* Free to use

We also had a snow storm this morning. I live in a city that doesn’t get snow often, so when it happens all hell breaks loose. I woke up at my normal time and saw that my street was covered, and so was the rest of my city—so the first thing I did was text the leader of the meeting alerting them that I won’t be onsite to set up the catering because I couldn’t leave my house, and that I doubted our support staff would be onsite as well given the snow that’s mucking up traffic everywhere. Our office hadn’t made a decision yet to close, so I went back to sleep. When I woke up (about an hour before I normally log in/start work) I saw that the office had made the call to close, so I canceled the catering.

Almost two hours later the leader asked me where the coffee was…and I told them that I had canceled the catering because the office was closed and there wasn’t anyone onsite to accept the order. Odd, because I didn’t think anyone was onsite. Two hours after that my exec asked me where the lunch catering was…I said, AGAIN that the office was closed so I canceled the catering. Well apparently all of the executives showed up and they were expecting lunch??? So I had to scramble and try to figure out how on earth to get lunch to these execs when no one is onsite to grab food and deliver it to them!! My exec ended up going to a restaurant onsite to get lunch before I could get a catering order to Panera in, so it ended up working out, but I’m doubting I did the wrong thing. 

What would you have done?? I feel like I shouldn’t have canceled the order, but…the office was closed! Earlier in the day my exec had sent a message to their leadership team telling them to stay home!! So how was I supposed to know they were onsite?",18,1738808126.0,ExecutiveAssistants,18,0.96,False
