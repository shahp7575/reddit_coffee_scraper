Tea is the superior hot bitter beverage, and probably the top standard hot beverage. Without going in to taste, it's more consistent, hydrates you, caffeinates you, and doesn't make you ill if you drink too many. 

Both tea and coffee are better hot than cold. They are more flavourful, are still refreshing on a hot day, and have a greater warming effect in the cold than their cold variants have a cooling effect in the heat. 

Cold tea is not even an acceptable drink. It should not exist. Lipton will pay for their crimes against god and man. You have sullied a wonderful beverage and I won't hear a single word in favour of pisswater

1idw5aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1idw5aa/the_reflection/,THE REFLECTION,"I moved into the apartment on a Thursday. It wasn’t much—peeling paint on the walls, uneven floors, and a kitchen that looked like it hadn’t been updated since the ‘70s—but it was cheap, and I needed cheap. The landlord handed me the keys with a nod, barely saying a word. He seemed eager to be rid of me, like he didn’t want to stick around.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It wasn’t overpowering, but it was there. A damp, musty scent, like old wood left out in the rain. I shrugged it off. Old buildings smell like that sometimes.

The apartment was mostly empty, except for a few pieces of worn furniture that looked like they came from a thrift store. In the hallway, there was a mirror. It was tall, maybe six feet, with a thick gold frame that had intricate carvings along the edges. The glass was cloudy, smudged with dust and fingerprints.

I wasn’t sure why, but the mirror made me uneasy. It felt out of place, like it didn’t belong there. I told myself I was just being paranoid. Moving is stressful, and this was my first place on my own. Everything was bound to feel strange at first.

That first night, the apartment was eerily quiet. The kind of quiet that makes you feel like you’re being watched. I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the floorboards made my skin crawl.

The next morning, I decided to clean. The mirror was the first thing I tackled. I grabbed an old rag and some glass cleaner and started scrubbing. As I wiped away the grime, I caught my reflection staring back at me.

Something about it didn’t feel right. I don’t know how to explain it, but it didn’t look like me. Not exactly. The movements were the same—I waved my hand, and the reflection waved back—but the eyes felt different. Like they were too aware, too focused.

I shook it off and finished cleaning. By the time the mirror was spotless, it looked like any other mirror. Just a piece of glass in a fancy frame.

That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I told myself I was imagining things, that I was just spooked from being in a new place. But when I turned off the lights and climbed into bed, I could feel it—the mirror. It was like it was watching me.

I kept waking up. Every time I did, I found myself staring at the doorway where the mirror stood, just out of sight. My heart would race, and I’d have to remind myself to breathe. It’s just a mirror, I thought. Glass and wood. Nothing more.

By the third night, I started noticing things. Little things. A flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye. A shadow that didn’t match anything in the room. I told myself it was the light, the way it bounced off the glass.

But then, late that night, I saw something I couldn’t explain. I was in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to calm my mind. I glanced toward the hallway and froze.

The reflection wasn’t mine.

It was standing in the mirror, staring into the bedroom. The face was mine, but the expression wasn’t. It was twisted, wrong. The eyes were wide, unblinking. The mouth was curled into a faint, unnatural smile.

I blinked, and it was gone.

I stayed awake until dawn, my back pressed against the headboard, clutching the blanket like it could protect me.

The mirror hasn’t moved, but something tells me it doesn’t need to. Whatever is in there, it’s waiting. Watching.

And I don’t know how much longer I can ignore it.

I didn’t sleep that night. Every creak, every groan of the old apartment sent my heart racing. I kept looking at the hallway, expecting to see that twisted face again. It didn’t show up, but that didn’t make me feel any better.

When the first bit of sunlight crept through the blinds, I finally got up. My legs felt shaky as I made my way to the hallway. The mirror was right where it had been, tall and still, with the morning light glinting off its surface.

For a moment, I just stood there, staring at it. The reflection was normal now—just me, tired and pale, with dark circles under my eyes. I wanted to believe that what I’d seen was a dream, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

I grabbed a sheet from the closet and threw it over the mirror. The fabric caught on the edges of the ornate frame, covering it entirely. I stood back, feeling a small sense of relief. If I couldn’t see it, maybe it couldn’t see me either.

That didn’t last long.

The rest of the day, I couldn’t focus on anything. I tried unpacking more boxes, but every time I walked past the hallway, I felt it. The mirror was still there, even hidden under the sheet. I couldn’t explain it, but it was like the air around it was heavier.

By the time night rolled around, I was on edge. I left the lights on, every single one. Even then, I kept glancing toward the hallway.

Around midnight, the sound started.

It was faint at first. A soft tapping, like someone gently knocking on glass. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. The sound was coming from the hallway—from the mirror.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

The tapping grew louder, more insistent. It wasn’t random—it had a rhythm, like someone was trying to get my attention.

I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight. My hands were trembling as I crept toward the hallway. The tapping stopped the moment I stepped closer.

The sheet was still in place, draped over the mirror. Nothing had changed, but I knew better.

I wanted to walk away. To go back to my room, lock the door, and pretend none of this was happening. But something compelled me to stay. My hand reached out, almost on its own, and I pulled the sheet down.

The mirror was spotless, the glass smooth and perfect. My reflection stared back at me, but it wasn’t right. It looked normal, but the eyes… they felt too sharp, too alive.

I wanted to step away, but I couldn’t. My reflection leaned forward, even though I wasn’t moving.

“Why are you scared?” it whispered.

The voice wasn’t mine. It was cold, distant, like it was coming from deep inside the mirror.

I stumbled back, almost tripping over my own feet. The reflection didn’t follow me this time—it stayed in the glass, smiling faintly.

“Don’t ignore me,” it said.

The lights in the hallway flickered, and the reflection began to blur. For a split second, I thought I saw something else in the glass—a dark shape, taller than me, with hollow eyes. But then it was gone.

I ran back to my room and slammed the door shut. My breathing was shallow, my hands shaking as I pressed my back against the door.

I didn’t sleep at all that night.

By morning, I decided I couldn’t stay here. I didn’t care about breaking the lease or losing the deposit—I just needed to get out.

But when I tried to leave, the front door wouldn’t budge.

The lock turned easily, and the handle moved, but it was like something was holding the door shut. I pulled harder, throwing my weight into it, but it didn’t make a difference.

Behind me, I heard the tapping again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I turned slowly, my stomach twisting into knots. The mirror was still in the hallway, uncovered now, and my reflection was back.

It wasn’t smiling anymore. It looked angry.

“You can’t leave,” it said.

The voice wasn’t a whisper this time. It was loud, filling the apartment.

I backed away, pressing myself against the front door. My reflection stepped closer, even though I hadn’t moved.

“You belong to me now,” it said.

The lights flickered again, and the apartment felt colder. I don’t know how long I stood there, staring at the mirror. But when the lights finally came back on, the reflection was gone.

The mirror was empty.

I tried the door again, and this time it opened. I didn’t think—I just ran. Out of the apartment, down the stairs, into the street.

I haven’t gone back.

But sometimes, when I pass by the building, I can feel it. The mirror is still in there, waiting.

And sometimes, I think it’s watching me.

I didn’t know what to do after that. I’d left the apartment behind, but it didn’t feel like I’d escaped. The first few nights at my friend Taylor’s place were quiet. I slept on her couch, with the TV on for background noise, and told myself everything would be fine.

But it wasn’t fine.

I hadn’t told Taylor much, just that the apartment creeped me out and I needed a place to crash. She didn’t ask questions, which I appreciated. But I couldn’t keep pretending nothing was wrong.

The first sign came three nights later. I woke up in a cold sweat at 3 a.m. The TV was still playing some late-night infomercial, but the sound was muted. I glanced around the room, heart racing, and then I saw it.

My reflection.

There was a large window behind Taylor’s couch, and in the faint glow of the streetlights outside, I could see my reflection in the glass. Except it wasn’t just mine.

Something else was there, standing just behind me.

It was the same dark figure I’d seen in the mirror, its hollow eyes staring at me through the glass.

I whipped around, but there was nothing there. My breath came in short, shallow gasps as I stared at the empty room. When I turned back to the window, the figure was gone.

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

The next morning, Taylor noticed the bags under my eyes. “You look like hell,” she said, handing me a cup of coffee. “You sure you’re okay?”

I wanted to tell her everything, but where would I even start? “Yeah,” I mumbled. “Just couldn’t sleep.”

She gave me a look but didn’t push it.

That day, I tried to keep busy. I scrolled through apartment listings, went for a walk, even helped Taylor with some errands. But no matter what I did, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched.

By the time the sun set, my nerves were shot. I told Taylor I wasn’t feeling well and went to bed early, hoping sleep would come if I just shut my eyes and waited.

It didn’t.

Around midnight, I heard it again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I froze, my eyes snapping open. The sound was coming from the window this time.

I sat up slowly, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. The curtains were drawn, but the tapping continued, steady and deliberate.

I didn’t want to look. I didn’t want to know. But something pulled me toward the window anyway.

I reached out with a trembling hand and pulled the curtain back.

There was nothing there. Just the empty street below and the dim glow of a streetlamp.

I let out a shaky breath and turned away, but then I heard it. A voice, soft and familiar, whispering my name.

I spun back to the window, and there it was. My reflection.

But it wasn’t right.

The glass didn’t show the room behind me. Instead, it showed the hallway from my old apartment. The mirror.

And my reflection was smiling again.

“You can’t run,” it said.

The voice sent chills down my spine. It wasn’t coming from the window—it was in my head, echoing like a bad memory.

I stumbled back, tripping over the edge of the couch. My reflection didn’t follow me this time. It stayed in the window, grinning, its empty eyes locked onto mine.

“Leave me alone!” I shouted, my voice cracking.

Taylor came rushing into the room, her face a mix of confusion and concern. “What’s going on?” she asked.

I pointed at the window, but when she turned to look, it was just a window again. My reflection was normal, the hallway and the mirror gone.

“I… I thought I saw something,” I stammered.

Taylor frowned, crossing her arms. “You’re freaking me out. Are you sure everything’s okay?”

I wanted to tell her the truth, but how could I? She’d think I was losing my mind. Maybe I was.

“Yeah,” I lied. “Just a bad dream.”

She didn’t look convinced, but she nodded. “Alright. But if you need to talk, I’m here, okay?”

I nodded, forcing a weak smile.

When she left the room, I collapsed onto the couch, my head in my hands. I couldn’t keep living like this. The mirror wasn’t just in that apartment—it was following me.

And I had no idea how to make it stop.

The next day, I knew I couldn’t ignore it any longer. Whatever was happening, whatever *it* was, I needed answers.

I didn’t say much to Taylor that morning. She was already on edge from the night before, giving me that look people give when they’re not sure if you’re okay but don’t know how to ask. I just told her I had errands to run and left.

My first stop was the library. It felt old-fashioned, but Googling “haunted mirror” and “weird reflections” hadn’t gotten me very far. At least at the library, I could dig deeper, maybe even find some local stories about the apartment or the building.

The librarian was a small, older woman with kind eyes. She didn’t ask why I needed information on “strange occurrences in apartments” or “haunted objects,” which I appreciated. She simply pointed me toward a section of local history books and articles.

I spent hours flipping through yellowed pages and faded photographs. Most of it was boring—city planning, old businesses, stories of long-dead locals—but one article caught my attention.

It was from the 1970s, about a man named Richard Ames. He’d lived in my old apartment, the same one with the mirror. The headline read: “Mysterious Disappearance Leaves More Questions Than Answers.”

The story detailed how Richard Ames had vanished without a trace. Neighbors reported hearing strange noises coming from his apartment late at night—whispers, laughter, tapping on the walls. The landlord found the place empty a week later, except for one thing: a massive gold-framed mirror, left in the hallway.

The description matched the mirror exactly.

I leaned back in my chair, my pulse racing. The article didn’t explain what happened to Richard or why he disappeared, but it felt like confirmation. This wasn’t just in my head. The mirror had a history.

But what did it want with me?

I copied down the article’s details and headed home. Well, to Taylor’s home. It didn’t feel like mine anymore.

When I got there, she was waiting for me, arms crossed. “You’ve been gone all day,” she said. “Are you okay?”

I hesitated. I’d been brushing her off for days, but I couldn’t do it anymore. “I need to tell you something,” I said, my voice quieter than I wanted it to be.

Taylor frowned but gestured for me to sit down. “Alright, spill.”

So, I told her everything. The mirror, the reflection, the tapping, the voice. I left nothing out.

When I finished, Taylor just stared at me, her mouth slightly open. “You’re serious?” she finally said.

I nodded.

She sighed, rubbing her temples. “Okay. This is… a lot. But if you think this mirror is haunted or cursed or whatever, why don’t we just go back to the apartment and get rid of it?”

Her suggestion caught me off guard. The thought of going back made my stomach churn, but she had a point. If the mirror was the source of all this, destroying it might be the only way to end it.

“I don’t know if that’ll work,” I said. “But I’m willing to try.”

Taylor grabbed her car keys before I could change my mind. “Then let’s do it. The sooner, the better.”

The drive to the apartment was tense. I hadn’t been back since I left, and seeing the building again made my chest tighten. It looked the same—run-down, quiet—but now I knew better.

We went up the stairs, and I unlocked the door with the spare key I still had. The air inside was stale, and the musty smell hit me immediately. The mirror was right where I’d left it, in the hallway, its gold frame catching the faint light from the window.

Taylor walked up to it, inspecting it like it was just another piece of furniture. “This is it?” she asked.

I nodded, staying a few steps back.

She tapped the glass. “Doesn’t look so scary to me.”

Before I could respond, the reflection shifted.

Taylor froze, her hand still against the glass. Her reflection turned to look directly at her, even though she wasn’t moving.

“What the hell…” she whispered, stepping back.

The reflection didn’t mimic her. Instead, it smiled—a wide, unnatural grin that didn’t belong on her face.

“Taylor, get away from it!” I yelled.

But it was too late.

The mirror started to hum, a low, vibrating sound that made my teeth ache. The air around us felt heavy, like the room was collapsing in on itself.

“Do you see that?” Taylor shouted, backing away.

I saw it. The surface of the mirror rippled like water, and the reflection reached out. A hand—Taylor’s hand, but *not* Taylor’s—pressed against the glass from the inside, its fingers curling as if trying to break through.

“Run!” I screamed, grabbing her arm and yanking her toward the door.

The mirror’s hum grew louder, almost deafening, and the distorted reflection of Taylor watched us with that same twisted grin.

We didn’t stop running until we were outside, gasping for air.

“What the hell was that?” Taylor panted, her face pale.

“I don’t know,” I said, my voice shaking. “But I think it wants more than just a reflection.”

Neither of us spoke for a long time. We just sat on the curb outside the building, catching our breath, our minds racing. Taylor was the first to break the silence.

“What do we do now?” she asked. Her voice was shaky, but there was a sharpness to it, a demand for answers I didn’t have.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “But we can’t just leave it there. It’s… dangerous. I mean, you saw it. That thing isn’t just some creepy trick. It’s—”

“Alive,” she finished for me. “Or something close to it.”

We sat there a little longer, the weight of what we’d seen pressing down on us. The mirror wasn’t just haunted. It wasn’t just showing strange reflections. It was *something else*, something I couldn’t explain.

“We should destroy it,” Taylor said finally.

Her words hung in the air, heavy and final. Destroying it felt like the logical choice, but the thought of going back in there, of facing that thing again, made my stomach churn.

“What if it doesn’t work?” I asked. “What if breaking it makes it worse?”

Taylor gave me a sharp look. “Worse than it already is? That thing tried to pull me in. I’m not letting it sit there and wait for someone else to stumble onto it.”

She was right. As much as I wanted to run away, to never think about that mirror again, I couldn’t leave it behind for someone else to find.

“Alright,” I said. “But we need to be smart about it. If we’re going to destroy it, we need to make sure it’s gone for good.”

Taylor nodded, her jaw set. “Let’s do it tonight. Before we lose our nerve.”





The hours dragged by as we made our plan. We’d bring tools—hammers, a crowbar, whatever we could find—to break the mirror apart. We’d bag up the pieces and take them far away from the apartment, maybe to the river or some secluded spot where no one would ever find them.

Taylor raided her dad’s garage for supplies while I sat at her kitchen table, staring at the article I’d found about Richard Ames. I couldn’t stop thinking about him. Had he tried to destroy the mirror? Had it stopped him?

When Taylor returned, her arms loaded with tools, I pushed the thought away. We didn’t have time for second-guessing.

“You ready?” she asked, setting a sledgehammer on the floor with a thud.

“Not really,” I said honestly. “But let’s do it.”





We drove back to the apartment just before midnight. The streets were empty, and the building loomed in the dark, its windows like hollow eyes.

The air inside was colder than before, and the silence felt oppressive. My heart was pounding as we made our way to the hallway, the tools clanking in the bag Taylor carried.

The mirror was waiting for us, just like before. Its surface was still and smooth, but I could feel it watching us.

“Let’s get this over with,” Taylor muttered, pulling the sledgehammer from the bag.

She handed me a crowbar, and we stood in front of the mirror, both of us hesitating.

“Do you feel that?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Taylor nodded. “Yeah. Like it’s… alive.”

I tightened my grip on the crowbar. “On three?”

She nodded again.

“One… two…”

Before I could say three, the mirror rippled. The smooth surface shifted, and our reflections appeared—not as they should have been, but wrong. Twisted.

Taylor’s reflection had empty black eyes and a smile stretched too wide, like it was pulled by invisible strings. Mine was worse. It wasn’t smiling. It was staring at me, its head tilted, its expression full of something I couldn’t name.

Fear. Hunger. Hate.

“Do it!” I shouted.

Taylor swung the sledgehammer with all her strength. The impact rang out like a gunshot, and the mirror cracked, a jagged line splitting down the middle.

The reflections didn’t shatter. They moved.

Taylor swung again, and the crack widened, but now the mirror was humming, the same low, vibrating sound as before. The room felt like it was spinning, the air thick and heavy.

“Keep going!” I yelled, raising the crowbar and slamming it against the glass.

The mirror groaned, like a living thing in pain. More cracks spread across its surface, but the reflections were still there, moving, pressing against the glass as if trying to break through.

“Why isn’t it breaking?” Taylor screamed, hitting it again and again.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. The humming was deafening now, and the cracks in the glass were glowing, a sickly, unnatural light spilling out.

Then, the mirror screamed.

It was a sound I’ll never forget—high-pitched, inhuman, full of rage and despair. The light from the cracks flared, blinding us, and the air around us seemed to explode.

I was thrown backward, hitting the wall hard. The last thing I saw before everything went black was the mirror shattering, the pieces flying in every direction like shards of light.

And then, silence.

When I came to, everything was quiet. Too quiet.

My head was pounding, and I struggled to sit up. The hallway was dim, lit only by the faint flicker of a streetlamp outside. Broken shards of glass glittered on the floor like tiny stars, and the tools Taylor and I had brought lay scattered.

“Taylor?” My voice came out hoarse, barely above a whisper. I looked around, panic building in my chest when I didn’t see her.

Then I heard a groan.

“Taylor!” I scrambled toward the sound, my hands crunching over shards of glass. She was slumped against the wall a few feet away, clutching her arm.

“Hey, hey, are you okay?” I asked, grabbing her shoulders.

She blinked at me, her eyes dazed. “What… what happened?”

“The mirror,” I said. “It shattered.”

Her gaze shifted to the pile of broken glass, and she let out a shaky breath. “Is it… gone?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted. My voice trembled despite my efforts to stay calm.

We both turned to look at the spot where the mirror had hung. The golden frame was still there, but the glass was gone—reduced to a million tiny pieces scattered across the floor.

But something felt off.

The air was heavy, like the moment before a thunderstorm. And there was a faint sound, so quiet I almost missed it. A whisper.

“Do you hear that?” I asked.

Taylor’s face went pale. “Yeah. It’s coming from…”

We both turned to the largest shard of glass lying on the floor. The whispering was louder now, rising and falling like a chant in a language I couldn’t understand.

“I think we need to leave,” Taylor said, her voice tight.

I nodded, but my legs felt like lead. I couldn’t take my eyes off the shard. There was something in it—movement, shapes twisting and writhing just beneath the surface.

“Come on,” Taylor urged, pulling at my arm.

That snapped me out of it. I stood, gripping her hand, and we stumbled out of the hallway. My heart was racing as we ran down the stairs and out into the cold night air.

We didn’t stop until we were a block away. Only then did we turn to look back at the building.

The window on the second floor—the one closest to where the mirror had been—was glowing faintly.

Taylor shivered. “What do we do now?”

I didn’t have an answer. Destroying the mirror had felt like the only solution, but whatever we’d done hadn’t fixed things. If anything, it felt worse.

“We need help,” I said finally. “Someone who knows about… this kind of thing.”

“Like an exorcist?” Taylor asked, her voice dripping with skepticism.

“Maybe,” I said. “I don’t know. But we can’t just leave it like this.”

Taylor sighed, rubbing her face with her hands. “Okay. But not tonight. I can’t… I just can’t.”

I nodded. I didn’t blame her. My whole body ached, and my mind was a mess.

We went back to her car and sat in silence for a while, trying to process what had happened.

But as we sat there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we weren’t alone.





That night, I stayed at Taylor’s place. Neither of us slept. We sat in her living room with the lights on, jumping at every creak and shadow.

Around three in the morning, my phone buzzed.

The screen lit up with a notification: ""Missed Call – Unknown.""

My heart skipped a beat.

“Who is it?” Taylor asked, her voice wary.

I didn’t answer. My hands were trembling as I unlocked the phone and checked my voicemail.

There was a new message.

With a deep breath, I pressed play.

At first, there was only static. Then, faintly, I heard it.

My own voice.

“Don’t look behind you.”

A cold chill ran down my spine. Taylor must have seen the look on my face because her eyes widened.

“What is it?” she asked.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

Because I could feel it.

Something was behind me.

I didn’t turn around.

And I don’t think I ever will.

1idw2ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1idw2ka/profitec_move_vs_ascaso_duo_plus_2k_usd/,Profitec Move vs Ascaso Duo Plus [$2K USD],"I'm trying to decide between Profitec Move ([link](https://www.wholelattelove.com/collections/semi-automatic-espresso-machines/products/profitec-move-espresso-machine)) or Ascaso Duo ([link](https://ascaso-usa.com/products/ascaso-steel-duo-plus-pid-automatic-espresso-machine-black)). If you think another machine fits the bill please comment.

I'm listing all my homework and my criteria. 

* Location: USA (Tx)
* Budget 2K USD aprox
* I use it mostly for milk drinks, often 2 drinks back to back (about 2 times a day)
* Dual Boiler (or Dual Heating Element)
* Known Brands with good support
* Cool touch milk wands
* PID for water and steam
* Hot water spouts (Ascaso draws from the coffee block, Profitec from the steam boiler)
* both are out of stock or on pre-order, so I have time.

**Looks:**

Looking for something that looks nice in a modern kitchen (key for SO approval), is easy to keep clean, but does not necessarily draw too much attention. (i.e. don't like the looks of most E61 like Profitec 400 Pro, or industrial looks with plastic switches like Gaggia Classic Pro), and don't particularly like the mirrored chrome finish either.

I'm coming from 3 years with a Breville, of which I like the heat-up time but not how long it takes me to make two cappuccinos back to back. There is also a little bit of inconsistency when doing that.

What I like about the **Profitec Move:**

* The color and looks (black with wood accents)
* Dual boiler
* The menu is easy to navigate

What I don't like:

* Boilers seem like old tech (slow heat-up, easy to build up scale, more likely to have stale water, etc.)
* The machine purges more water than the Duo to the tray (instead of to the reservoir), i.e. frequently having to empty it.
* Needs a large top clearance to fill or remove the water reservoir
* some reviews only mention time-based shot programming
* The drip tray seems worse to deal with than the Duo (needs to be tilted to get out of the machine)
* Very few reviews (newer machine..)

What I like about the **Ascaso Duo Plus**:

* The color and the looks (again black with wood accents)
* Dual heating blocks (i.e. freshwater)
* Easy to fill the water tank from the side.
* Active cup warmer

What I don't like:

* Seems to vibrate a lot
* The menu is cumbersome
* The logo in front is a plastic sticker
* Complaints about quality assurance
* Doesn't seem to have true volumetric (volume sensor is placed before OPV
* Needs 20A Circuit (although comes with 15 Adapter, not that is recommended to use)
* Pump is set to 11bars and Ascaso, I know adjusting grinds will make it operate at 9 if I need to, but seems odd.

Things they both lack (would be great to hear options that do have these in my budget):

* Neither can be pumbled in (don't need it but might be nice to have for the future)

Things I'm not listing but do understand:

* Heat-up: Ready to pull a shot is not the same as having all elements heated up (still will take 10 or so minutes)
* Good fresh coffee is king and a decent grinder is a default at this level
* Considered the Diletta Mio but did not liked it (superficially)
* Considered the Ascaso Duo (not plus) but prefer the Plus",1,1738267470.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

She found out I had a meeting near where she works and asked if we could meet for a coffee..I ended up meeting her and found she was really cool in person, fun and liked the vibe.

We texted for a few days afterwards and I offered to return the favour and ask her out during lunch time. She said she was working remotely due to a public holiday (she works for a Chinese company and they get Chinese new year off/away from the office)

I replied with ""that's all good. Enjoy the break"" and haven't heard back since.

I'm interested to gauge what her intentions are... at first I thought maybe she wants a professional connection (I work in recruitment) but all the interactions are non work conversations. I thought maybe she wants to date as she replied within a few seconds and laughed a lot at my jokes but now it's gone dead silent.

1idvyrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/1idvyrt/amazing_bg_day_12925/,AMAZING BG Day (1/29/25),"So I had *sortof* fallen off my IF plan. I was following it, but usually I just have a protein drink or bar as I'm trying to stick to OMAD but for the last few weeks, I had been eating and more ""heavily"" than normal.

So about 2 days ago I decided I needed to get back to basics, because at one time I wasn't taking as much insulin and frequently my long-acting night time insulin was cut in half, but slowly it had been going back up.

Yesterday was a slightly longer IF (usually 16:8 but yesterday worked out to be close to 20hrs). As I wear a CGM I check my BG regularly but nothing significant happened. I was consistently > 5.0 (or 105).

Yesterday was the first day in weeks that I did not have to take insulin with my meal. What did I eat?

* Large bowl of chicken salad (lettuce, spinach, cucumber, carrots)
* Homemade dressing (olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper and oregano)
* Chicken -- I forgot to weigh the chicken, but it was a pretty large piece of chicken breast

I also had potatoes, I probably should not have but i did. That added 26g of carbs (but still no insulin taken), along with that I had pomegranate, and some cashews.

After breaking my fast, I had two protein bars, an XL McDs coffee with creamer and no sugar (not even sweetener). Again, no spikes.

Here is what my BG looked like yesterday:

https://preview.redd.it/qbyfsx09s6ge1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad6fe558b19290fd84f8aa2e187489784d896d1

See the spike? That was dinner other than that, fairly ""stable"" for the rest of the evening and night. My CGM didn't beep that I'd dropped too low.

Today my BG has stayed pretty consistent below 6, but spiked when I woke up -- which I always expect but it's levelled off to around 6.4 (108.8). My fast is supposed to end around noon, but I'll probably stretch it out until around 1pm or 2pm.

If you decide to use IF - double-check with your doctor, I spoke with my family physician and endocrinologist who both said it's safe. I also get regular blood work done to make sure nothing crazy is going on.

The bonus with IF is that I do lose weight!",1,1738267229.0,type2diabetes,0,1.0,False
1idvy7o,https://i.redd.it/l1kepzots6ge1.jpeg,"I’m Just a Simple Karma Farmer, Out Here Tending My Digital Crops 🚜✨","Look, I know karma farming gets a bad rap, but I wear that title with pride. Every morning, I wake up, rub my eyes, stretch like a housecat, and step outside onto the metaphorical porch of the internet, sipping my coffee like an old-timey farmer surveying the land. My fields? Vast. My livestock? Thriving. My crops? Good vibes, solid advice, and well-placed jokes.

I don’t do it for the numbers (okay, maybe a little), but because I love this community. Reddit is my farm, and I take pride in my harvest. My fields span far and wide:

🌱 r/selfharm & r/selfharmteens – Someone’s having a rough time? I’m rolling up with a metaphorical blanket, a plate of digital cookies, and the kind of encouragement I wish I had sooner. Healing isn’t linear, but neither are some of the best hiking trails, and I’m here to remind people that the view from the top is always worth the climb.

🌈 r/lgbt – Someone just came out? Cue confetti cannons. Someone’s questioning? Buddy, I’ve got a PowerPoint presentation ready to go, complete with a flowchart and a warm, reassuring “Take your time, you’re doing great.”

📝 r/quotes – Someone needs motivation? Boom. Here’s an Oscar Wilde gem that makes you feel like the main character. Need a 2 AM existential crisis? Bam. Have some Nietzsche, best enjoyed under dim lighting with dramatic music playing.

🗳️ r/politicalopinions – Someone’s passionately debating whether we should fund infrastructure or a national Guy Fieri monument? I’m rolling in with a well-researched, charmingly sarcastic take and a gentle nudge toward “Hey, maybe we start with healthcare and work our way up?”

🚪 r/abusiverelationships – Someone’s second-guessing red flags? I’m there like an overprotective friend who’s just found out their bestie is dating a walking disaster. “Oh, your partner accidentally read all your messages, controls your schedule, and makes you feel like a hostage in your own life? Bestie, that’s not love—that’s a horror movie script with a bad ending. Let’s get you a better plotline.”

And when those upvotes roll in? Oh, baby, it’s harvest season. My metaphorical crops are thriving. The algorithm is smiling upon me. Somewhere, an old man in overalls nods in approval.

But at the end of the day, it’s not about the karma—it’s about the people. Every upvote means someone felt a little less alone, a little more seen, or just got the right words at the right time. And if that makes me a karma farmer? Then so be it. I’ll be out here, tending the land, making sure these Reddit fields stay full of good energy and well-timed humor.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a self-care reminder to post, a bad political take to fact-check, and a powerful Sylvia Plath quote to drop at just the right moment.

I was homeschooled a bit, so I guess I’m a bit gullible . She set these boundaries in the relationship for example, I am to not follow another guy or like his photo because it is perceived, as I am flirting with them with him nor am I to be overly friendly with another male in person in front of him because it is redeemed as disrespectful another things like this just so you can understand the jiss I did not expect this phone since he seemed like such a perfect boyfriend he will always take me out on dates. He’ll be very honest with where he’s at. To give even more of a background he takes gear and is a pro bodybuilder unsure if this has anything to do with it probably not but I don’t know much about it late year 2023 my friend found him on hinge due to another girl telling her And they were talking and on the phone for hours and he would send her memes on Instagram. I was very heartbroken but decided to stay since I guess they never met up and once again I believe him to be close to perfect so I felt like I couldn’t do any better. A week or two later, he had broken his back to be honest I felt like it was karma feel bad for feeling that way, but that’s truly how I felt. I would always help him by taking care of his dogs when he was away or cleaning up his place while he was gone, when he would go on trips. I am unsure about how friendly he would be with other females on this trip because he does social media and so he had sponsorship trips and there would be females on there, but I would see that he would follow them and like their pictures so it feels like there would be a double standard and when I would confront him on this he explain to me that he knows what he’s doing and he works with these people and they are like his coworkers and so it is not like that. I then proceeded to look through his laptop late 2024. because I’ve never occurred to me that I have access to it, and that his messages are connected to it. I would look up keywords like my name, and I will see him bad mouthing me quite often which honestly once again hurt or making fun of me wanting him to hang out with me and my family or inviting him to church like he was laughing about it with his sister, as if I was asking him such a stupid question and that it was obvious that he would not go like he would say why am I even asking him keep in mind I had flown over to his hometown, which is in New Jersey and we live in South Florida, and I would spend time with his family and get to know them and he wouldn’t do the same for me and my family live 20 minutes from him. I also would see that he was talking to other girls and he would tell his sister about it and this was in the year 2023. He invite these girls on these dates and he would even tell his cousin to mind you. I have met these people and gone on trips with these people and so I’m looking back at moments that we had and I feel very stupid that they knew that he was doing this behind my back and I was there talking about how I want to marry him today is Thursday, but on Monday I was walking up to the Pickleball courts because we play together and to be honest I felt like most recently he would try to avoid me and go play by himself like he would try to go super fast or he would not message me and then message me after and say I was at pickleball and give me almost like no chance to go play with him. I felt like that was done on purpose, but anyways, I’m walking up to the court and I see him talking to a girl and their phones are out and I guess they exchanged numbers. I didn’t find out until Tuesday the following day that this had happened and I guess she was inviting him to some Pickleball tournament and supposedly he wanna ask me which I guess could be True probably is but it was more of the action of why did you exchange phone numbers because I know if I was to have done that the world would’ve been over for me. Moving onto yesterday, Wednesday. we had had a good day playing pickle ball. Last thing I had forgot to mention that the week before I invited him to go to church with me because I was giving a talk and it was very important to me and I just wanted him to come support me as I always go support him for his bodybuilding shows This was like the equivalent for me he basically just told me that no he doesn’t want to go, and he doesn’t know what I would invite him to church because he will never go to church and for me it was more of not so much going to church but just supporting me doing a public speaking for a lot of people. Some of our pickleball friends want to attend and support me, but not him. Anyways, back to yesterday, Wednesday after playing pickle ball I had had a feeling of wanting to search up the keyword Church in his messages to see if he was talking crap about it, and I came across him talking to his sister about taking out another girl who I guess is like another Church girl? And he had mentioned no I’m not going to take her seriously I’m just gonna take her out on a coffee date and I cleaned up my place just in case he was taking a shower when I had read this and I was wondering if I should even bring anything up because how do I mention I just saw this on your laptop and invaded your privacy, but I had pretended that I found out a different way to see what he would say. Of course it killed the vibe but I was so frustrated in the moment he honestly was defending himself like a cheater just making me feel like I am crazy, but it was a bit annoying because I just saw the messages and photos I decided to leave and he lives in a busy city and there’s a lot of traffic at the time that I left and I got rear ended bad on the highway. I now have back pain and knee pain. (This was last night as I am writing this ) can I have texted him and called him and he took a while to even respond to me and my brother came to help me out and when he finally answered me, my boyfriend he told me I just need a drive safe. Jackson was bad and involved three cars in my car from the back looks pretty destroyed too, and I had sent him a video and he sounded extremely deadpan and unfazed and it was like I was bothering him and I guess I was because he was playing video games. I wasn’t too far from this place keep in mind I drive to him every single day for the last three years so I felt like how come you didn’t feel any guilt for never driving to me. Why couldn’t he even offer to come see me? I was playing video games more important than to seeing if I was OK? Made me realize that I’m not cater to as much as I would like to be in a relationship. I’m not really taking care of as a female sure he pays for things but it feels like the easy way out. Better that night he proceeded to act like nothing happened. Oh, I forgot to mention that 95% of our conversations are just on him like how good he is at something or something that he’s interested in, but if I am to revert the conversation to something about me as I am speaking, he’ll make like a goofy voice to his dog and tell me to look at his dog, and I am sentence about something about me and this happens quite often. I have tested it out many times and it is a thing that when it comes to me, he doesn’t really want to talk about it or it’s just very disinterested and so the same thing happened last night. I was on the freeway for four hours waiting for police to come and I was finally home and I was telling him how I was in pain and he still found a way to make the conversation about him, and I had to be quiet and comfort him. It is like I am now forced to not drive to him because of my car so I am unsure if he will even drive to me these next few days, but I don’t feel like he will. but I had prayed about this a lot, and I feel like this is God‘s way of telling me this is not it for me, but I guess I will wait a few days to see if he will make more effort which I highly doubt to be honest I want him to, but I just can’t even imagine him doing that at all like it would even feel weird for me to witness him trying so I’m unsure what will happen ",1,1738267145.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False
1idvwwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/IcelandExplorers/comments/1idvwwx/the_locals_guide_to_reykjavík_secrets_only/,The Local’s Guide to Reykjavík: Secrets Only Insiders Know (And You Should Too),"Reykjavík, Iceland’s quirky capital city, is often the first stop for travelers exploring this Nordic wonderland. With its colorful houses, vibrant arts scene, and proximity to jaw-dropping natural wonders, it’s easy to fall in love with Reykjavík at first glance. But beyond the postcard-perfect streets and tourist hotspots lies a treasure trove of secrets that only locals know—and now, so will you.

If you’re ready to experience Reykjavík like a true insider, buckle up. We’re diving deep into the hidden gems, local hacks, and off-the-beaten-path experiences that make this city truly unforgettable.

# 1. Skip Hallgrímskirkja—Visit These Lesser-Known Churches Instead

Yes, Hallgrímskirkja is iconic, but did you know there are other stunning churches in Reykjavík that offer equally breathtaking views without the crowds?

* **Landakotskirkja** : This neo-Gothic beauty might not get as much attention, but its intricate architecture and serene atmosphere make it worth a visit. Plus, you can climb to the top for panoramic views of the city.
* **Reykjavík Free Church (Fríkirkjan)** : Nestled by the lake Tjörnin, this charming wooden church feels like stepping back in time. It’s a favorite among locals for quiet reflection or simply admiring its picturesque setting.

**Pro Tip:** Visit early in the morning when these spots are nearly empty for an even more peaceful experience.

# 2. Ditch Touristy Eateries—Eat Where Locals Eat

While downtown Reykjavík has no shortage of trendy restaurants catering to tourists, the real culinary magic happens where locals gather.

* **Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur** : Sure, you’ve heard about Iceland’s famous hot dog stand, but here’s the secret: order “eina með öllu” (one with everything) and grab your meal to go. Then head to nearby **Austurvöllur Square** , where locals enjoy their pylsur while people-watching.
* **Kaffivagninn** : Known as one of Reykjavík’s oldest eateries, this waterfront spot serves hearty comfort food at reasonable prices. Locals rave about their fish soup—it’s practically a hug in a bowl.
* **Hidden Cafés** : For coffee lovers, skip the chains and head to cozy cafés like **Mokka Kaffi** or **Reykjavík Roasters Garðastræti** . Both are tucked away from the main drag and beloved by locals for their artisanal brews.

# 3. Explore Hidden Street Art & Secret Alleys

Reykjavík is bursting with creativity, and its street art scene is world-class—but many visitors miss out on the smaller alleys and side streets where some of the best murals hide.

* **Hverfisgata Street** : Often overlooked by tourists heading straight to Laugavegur, Hverfisgata is lined with incredible graffiti and murals. Keep an eye out for pieces by local artists like Guido van Helten.
* **Grandi Neighborhood** : Once an industrial area, Grandi has transformed into a hub for creative minds. Wander through its narrow streets to discover unexpected installations and pop-up galleries.

**Insider Hack:** Join a guided street art tour led by actual artists who created the works—you’ll learn fascinating stories behind each piece.

# 4. Discover Reykjavík’s Secret Rooftop Views

Most visitors flock to Perlan or Hallgrímskirkja for elevated views of the city, but insiders know there are quieter rooftops waiting to be explored.

* **Harpa Concert Hall Rooftop Terrace** : While most people admire Harpa’s dazzling glass facade, few realize you can access a rooftop terrace on the fourth floor. It’s free, uncrowded, and offers stunning vistas of the harbor.
* **Elliðaár River Walkway** : Head to the eastern part of town near the Elliðaár River. From certain vantage points along the walking paths, you can catch glimpses of Reykjavík framed by lush greenery—a view most tourists never see.

# 5. Shop Like a Local at Kolaportið Flea Market

Forget overpriced souvenir shops selling mass-produced trinkets. If you want authentic Icelandic goods, head to **Kolaportið** , the weekend flea market located in an old warehouse by the harbor.

Here’s what to look for:

* Hand-knitted wool sweaters (lopapeysa) made by local artisans.
* Fresh seafood straight from Icelandic waters (try the dried fish if you’re feeling adventurous!).
* Vintage vinyl records and secondhand books for unique finds.

**Local Tip:** Arrive early before the best items sell out, and don’t hesitate to haggle politely—it’s expected!

# 6. Escape the Crowds at Secret Beaches

Nauthólsvík Geothermal Beach may be popular, but savvy locals know where to find quieter seaside escapes.

* **Seltjarnarnes Peninsula** : Just a short drive from downtown, this tranquil peninsula boasts secluded beaches and coastal trails. On clear days, you can spot whales offshore while enjoying uninterrupted ocean views.
* **Grótta Lighthouse** : Located on the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula, Grótta is especially magical during sunset or Northern Lights season. Bring a thermos of hot chocolate and soak in the serenity.

# 7. Experience Reykjavík After Dark—Like a Local

Reykjavík comes alive after dark, but instead of hitting the usual bars, try these insider-approved activities:

* **Secret Cinema Nights** : Check social media for pop-up outdoor movie screenings in unexpected locations like parks or rooftops. These events are intimate and wildly fun.
* **Live Music Venues** : Skip the big-name concerts and check out intimate gigs at places like **Dillon** or **Gaukurinn** . You might stumble upon Iceland’s next big indie band!
* **Geothermal Pool-Hopping** : Forget the Blue Lagoon; join locals at public pools like **Laugardalslaug** or **Vesturbæjarlaug** . They’re affordable, less crowded, and perfect for mingling with residents.

# 8. Learn the Art of Slow Travel in Reykjavík

One of the biggest mistakes tourists make is trying to cram too much into their Reykjavík itinerary. Locals embrace a slower pace, savoring simple pleasures like:

* Strolling along Tjörnin Lake in the early morning mist.
* Picking wild berries in nearby hills during summer months.
* Chatting with shopkeepers and hearing their stories.

Take a cue from them: leave room in your schedule for spontaneity and relaxation. Sometimes the best memories come from unplanned moments.

# Final Thoughts: Unlock Reykjavík’s True Spirit

Reykjavík isn’t just a pit stop on your way to waterfalls and glaciers—it’s a destination brimming with soul, culture, and surprises. By venturing off the beaten path and embracing local traditions, you’ll uncover a side of the city that few travelers ever see.

So whether you’re sipping coffee in a hidden café, marveling at secret murals, or soaking in a geothermal pool under the midnight sun, remember this: the magic of Reykjavík lies not in ticking boxes but in connecting with its people, history, and untamed spirit.

Listen, man, I don’t care who started it—Republicans, Democrats, the ghost of the 2008 financial crisis—whatever. All I know is, I’ve got a mortgage, daycare costs that look like a second mortgage, and a grocery bill that makes me nostalgic for when I used to eat ramen by choice.

Like, I’m just trying to build a stable life for my family, and instead of focusing on literally anything useful, politicians are out here treating Congress like a reality show. “Oh, let’s debate some culture war nonsense while inflation skyrockets and nobody can afford a house!” Awesome. Meanwhile, I’m explaining to my kid why Daddy’s coffee costs $7 now and why she might need to go into trades instead of college because student loans are basically financial quicksand.

And don’t even get me started on housing. Back in the day, our parents bought homes on one salary, and now, both parents are working, side hustling, and selling stuff on Facebook Marketplace just to afford rent. I’ve got friends making six figures who still can’t buy a house because boomers refuse to downsize and interest rates are higher than my stress levels.

Also, can we talk about how every time the economy starts to stabilize, politicians pick a new fight that tanks the market? Like, I’m just trying to put money in my 401(k) without feeling like I’m betting on a roulette wheel. Can we focus on literally anything that helps families? Maybe childcare tax breaks? Lowering healthcare costs? Affordable housing? No? Okay, cool, let’s fight about Twitter drama instead.

Boomers are retired. Gen Z is still young enough to live at home. And us? We’re out here trying to be good dads while the economy burns, just hoping our kids don’t ask for anything too expensive for Christmas this year.

Since then, I sometimes catch myself reminiscing on some of the great dates I’ve had before; which is what made me write this post. 

To me, a date is a work of art. It has the potential of being an unforgettable experience if crafted properly and carefully even if things don’t work out between you and your date. 

Here in Dubai, the dating culture is leaning heavily towards spending money in fancy restaurants in hopes of getting the lady to go home with you. Or some variation of that. 

We need to bring back the art of dating! Because genuine and sincere connections need a proper setting to thrive. A club where you can’t hear what the person is saying isn’t the place for that. 

Now obviously you might not agree with me and that’s fine. Different people, different personalities and different preferences. But as a woman, I know what other women might want to feel and experience. So, I thought I would share some of my experiences in hopes of helping someone in planning their next date since I’m not going on one anytime soon :)

1. Beach dates

I have been on two types of beach dates: One was at a fancy french restaurant at Al Qasr hotel in Jumeirah with a view of Burj Al Arab. The other was at the same beach, same view but it was on the opposite side. Two chairs, a picnic mat, sunset, a walk on the shore and seashell collecting. Both were first dates but one lasted 3 hours and the other lasted 6. 

Personally fine dining makes me feel uneasy for some reason. Maybe because I am not used to it. And simple dates don’t have to mean low effort! The simple beach date was 10x better but my date still planned it for us and we had dinner together later at night (We stayed at the beach and ordered). 

My point is, with the notion of “I don’t do coffee dates” being trendy right now, don’t forget what actually makes a date memorable; the connection. The more relaxed the setting is, the more you get to focus on your date and be able to hold conversations comfortably. 

So make use of the great weather and go to the “Sunset Beach” in Jumeirah with a couple of chairs and snacks for your next date. Let me know how it goes!


2. Billiards Date

Y’all, this isn’t for the weak. I suck at billiards but oh my, is it a great date experience. 

The tension, the banter, the challenge. Teasing and stealing glances. Ladies, you can make a man weak if you know how to work your way around a billiards table. And if you let him mansplain the game to you? proceed at your own risk. 

This is better done with someone you are somewhat comfortable being around and physically close to. Say for second dates? Especially since the music might be too loud to have a proper conversation for first dates. 

My personal favorite spot for this was (The 44). It’s like a rooftop with a secret bowling alley and an outdoor area alongside the billiards tables. it’s an overall amazing spot for a date in terms of ambiance. Lots of fun, highly recommended. 

3. Get them something handmade

Now this is more of a tip than a date idea. But I once made some tea and put it in a thermal bottle for a picnic date I went on. The guy kept mentioning it months later saying how the date was one of the most romantic experiences he’s had. To make someone something with your own hands is very intimate. It gives the feeling of security and closeness. Like you’ve known them for years. It was so simple but the gesture meant a lot. I also once had a guy write me a letter and hand it to me at the end of the date. Also simple but a very genuine and memorable gesture. 

You don’t have to spend a fortune to leave a mark in someone’s memory. Also, as you can probably guess, I didn’t end up with any of the guys I mentioned. Sad? yes. But it goes to show that if a date was so good, the memory will continue being good even if things went south. 

Now I don’t want to make this post too long so I’ll keep it at 3 tips. I wish this would help someone out in planning a date because I believe a well planned date is the catalyst for a real, strong and lasting relationship. 

And remember: If you want a lady, be a gentleman. And vice versa ;)

Best of luck with your future romantic endeavors.

When we went: Summer 2024

Who went: My wife and I

Rooms: Booked a one bedroom suite, city view on a pay 2 stay 3 promo through our fabulous mod u/alex_travels

Service: 10

Service was excellent from start to finish. I pre arranged spa treatments and dinner reservations through the app. I asked for restaurant suggestions and they were right on.
The doormen there were very good about cabs and directions. Housekeeping was excellent. The in room dining service was very good.
Check in and out we're smooth. The spa staff and therapists was great. The bartenders at the lobby bar were very professional. Upon arrival for one dinner reservation off property we were thanked for being friends of Four Seasons and presented with a glass of champagne while our table was being setup.

Property: 9

The hotel is in a good central location. It connects to a shopping center. There's a lot of space to hang out once you get to the reception level. There's a good sized square lobby bar. I didn't go to the spa on this trip but we wife liked the facility. The pool was awesome. They've got the ice cream and cocktail carts for in room dining. The hotel has excellent city and lake views. The gym looked nice but I did not use it.

Rooms: 9

The room was large and laid out well. The entryway was long with the bedroom near the front door. The bedroom was large with a very comfortable bed and big walk in closet. The sheets and comforter were very nice as were the small plants around the room. 

The bathroom was good sized with a single vanity and shower/bath combo. The water pressure and temperature were good. The bathroom amenities smelled good.

The living room had big windows, a desk and chair, and a large kinda oddly shaped sofa. The sofa was comfortable but kinda hard to lay on due to the shape. There was a mini fridge, coffee station and an additional 3/4 bath.
We were on the top floor so the views were great. The air conditioning worked well.

Food: 9.5

We had in room dining for breakfast each day of our stay. Everything was very good. I mentioned that I like strong coffee and they didn't disappoint.The omelettes very fantastic. The burger at the lobby bar slaps. The shaved brussel sprout salad is also a winner. Sadly, we didn't try the ice cream cart 😔.

I (M24) have been on a few first dates but have never had a second date before. I thought my last date went well but it couldn't have if I didn't get a second. I realized my mistakes for my previous dates before that one. Of course these girls say stuff like ""I'm really busy"" or ""I didn't feel a romantic connection"" or more recently ""I'm looking for someone more extroverted than I am"". I assume that they are just trying to let me down gently so I never figure out what I did wrong. It's a bit frustrating, it's like failing a driving test but never being told what you did wrong.

Before you say that they may have been telling the truth, the one that told me that she ""didn't feel a romantic connection"" later told me I was ""too loud"" and blocked me after I agreed with her. I don't know about the others but I imagine they are letting me down softly.

I was thinking of having a friend ""monitor"" the date so that he could figure out what I am doing wrong so when I get the ""didn't feel a spark"" text I'll *actually* know what I did wrong. Unfortunately I live in a two party consent state or else I would record every date and play it back to analyze.

Of course the friend will remain hidden but be able to overhear everything. Like sitting behind me in a coffee shop or something. She'll never know because she'll reject me before I figure out my mistake. After I figure it out I'll go on dates without monitoring.

I know it's kinda creepy, but if I don't do this I'll never figure out what went wrong and be single forever! I'm inherently unattractive (I'm not just fat or anything. I've been told I look like Napoleon Dynamite) and don't get a lot of dates so I need to learn as much as I possibly can on these dates.

[$2500],"Hi everyone, long time reader but this is my first post here so first of all thank you very much for all the good reads until now.

I started my espresso journey with Breville Barista Express and I've been using it for 3 years and I'm very happy with it. As an upgrade, I just bought myself a new grinder, the Eureka ORO Mignon Single Dose Pro.

But now that I have a separate grinder, the whole setup takes a bit more space in my limited counter space. I can live with it, but to be honest I want a cleaner and simple setup, and it also bothers me that I only use my BBE for its espresso feature and the grinder sits there unused. I would prefer someone else to take advantage of it.

As I said I am very happy with the brewing capabilities of the BBE, I am not looking for an upgrade, I'm just looking for an alternative option without any sacrifices. I am very happy with the brand and know how easy it is to use the machine and don’t want to give up on that part. But is there a machine for me that will offer the same ease of use but with a little less footprint maybe?

At this point Im thinking of the Bambino Plus, but also dont want to miss out on other options if there are any. And definitely want to know if this is considered a downgrade from BBE, because I wouldn’t want that.

I checked Lelit Mara X and it also seemed like a good option but Im not sure if it will have the same user friendliness of the Breville, which I prefer. Also, the heat-up time seemed a lot for me, I wouldnt want to wait 10+ minutes for the 1 daily espresso that I make. BUT im still open for discussion on that.

* Do you think Bambino Plus would be a downgrade or exactly the same level as BBE, in terms of espresso brewing? I dont use the steamer.
* Should I just stick with my BBE and dont bother with a change?
* Or another option, I can still sell my BBE and can buy myself a Breville the Dual Boiler (mostly the same width as BBE). That would probably be overkill because I dont drink coffee with milk, but it's better if bambino plus is a downgrade and plus, Im getting a much more capable machine, and also it seems more consumer friendly than its competitors.

Here's my usage and what I expect from a machine:

* I only make 1 espresso/day in the mornings and thats all.
* No milk drinks, so steaming is not important.
* I like the user friendliness of Breville products and would not want to give up on that. Want to stay away from Prosumer products until it is really the time.
* I’m not interested in modding, so would like to have a capable machine from factory. But feel free the change my mind on this, I’m open for discussion.
* Theres not really a budget but let’s say max 2.500 USD.
* My limited space is only with width. Depth and height is no issue.

Slavic accent, kinda slurring his words. And basically said something along the lines of: “You look as bored as me. Wanna not be bored together?” Was kinda cringe ngl, but in a endearing way? We end up swapping numbers after he joked about my “emo TikTok vibe” (rude, but okay).

Things got *explicit*. And I’m not innocent here, I reciprocated, but he was the one always pushing it further. “What if I showed up at your place?” “Would you kiss me here… or here?” Blah. Blah. We voicecalled a lot too. I was actually really surprised he even noticed I was gay and just went for it. Then again, maybe he was just drunk enough at the party. Who knows? Anyway.

THEN. This Tuesday, I’m grabbing a coffee and who do I see? Him, standing with a group of guys. I wave, he goes pale, mutters “Hey” like I’m a stranger and literally dips out the back door. I text him later like ??? and he hits me with: “They dont know about me being gay.” When I asked if he wanted to hang for real, he said: “Well, yeah, but no one can know I'm gay.” Wtf?

I’m torn. On one hand, I get it, he said he's from Serbia, mentioned his dad’s super conservative, blah blah. But HE started this! And we didn't even kiss yet or anything.

Today I was standing at our register folding some new product. It was pretty slow so me and my boss were the only people on the floor. I heard the door open and I said my regular welcome spiel to the older couple that walked in. 

The lady stopped in her tracks and stared at me for a couple of minutes. She look white as a sheet. At first I thought I did something or maybe there was something on my face. So I quickly apologized for scaring her. 

The lady snapped out of it and muttered something to her husband before heading towards the back of the shop. I went back to folding and putting new stock out on the floor. But the entire time the couple kept staring at me and whispering something to each other. 

After about 40ish minutes in the store the headed to the register. I walked up there with them and began to scan their items the entire time the older lady was just staring at me. 

So I jokingly asked her if I had something on my face. That seemed to get her attention because she began apologizing to me for staring. The two paid and left. And I thought that was it. Maybe just an odd lady. 

While I was on my break I walked over to a coffee shop near the store and saw the old couple again. The women noticed me immediately and stared at me while I grabbed my drink and left. 

The two followed me outside and the lady stopped me. She apologized again for staring and for scaring me. She then told me I was the spitting image of her daughter who had passed away a couple years ago. 

She said I had the same hair, eyes, nose, freckles, and laugh.  She apologized again for freaking me out but said seeing me was like seeing her daughter again. 

I didn’t really know how to react so I just told her she didn’t need to apologize and said I was sorry for her loss. And we parted ways. Just an odd interaction ig. Idk. ",9,1738265843.0,PointlessStories,0,1.0,False
1idveub,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1idveub/day_1833_free_from_nicpouches/,Day 18/33 Free from nic/pouches!,"This will be my first time posting anything like this, but I feel drawn to do this both for myself, and for anyone who might benefit from my experience/perspective. So for whatever it is worth, here is my quitting story (so far):

First of all, I am in my mid-30's, and have been using stimulants for most of my life. I am pretty sure I have what they call an ADHD brain, and I have gone to various stimulants and substances to help me focus and get work done since I was a teenager. 

I started interacting with nicotine pretty early on with social smoking of cigarettes and hookah, but honestly I didn't really feel like it did much for me back then. I convinced myself that nicotine just didn't work on me or I didn't have the genes some talk about that supposedly predispose a person to nicotine addiction. I would smoke while drinking and share a hookah with a friend, but never really craved it. This went on for a long while, and other stimulants were my 'go-to' when I needed something to help me get stuff done.

Then came the pouches. For some reason, these pouches worked in a way that other forms of nicotine simply didn't. They put me right into the mental state that allowed me to hyper-focus on whatever needed doing regardless of how boring the activity was, and I could maintain this state for hours on end with a pouch in... When I first started using them, I felt like a productivity machine and kept telling myself that it was OK because I had used nicotine very frequently in the past and never had any problem putting it down for weeks or months. I would just take a break when things slowed down at work...

Well things didn't really slow down at all, and some life events happened which prevented me from getting enough sleep, and these pouches seemed to do the trick of pushing me through the exhaustion and keeping me productive, so suddenly I was popping them all throughout the day instead of only when I needed a boost. This is when things started to go south...

  
Eventually, the focused state that I could get in with the pouches at first started to become more and more elusive. I would wake up in the morning feeling like absolute garbage, pop a pouch in, and just feel a little less miserable (but still not energetic or focused or mentally clear). I would pop another and another, and sometimes feel 'good', but that feeling became more and more rare until eventually I was just various shades of miserable all the time regardless of how many pouches I consumed. My productivity started to go way down the drain, my relationships suffered, and I felt generally depressed and hopeless.

Eventually it became clear that these pouches were at the root of my problems and had to go, but the first day I tried to quit, I realized how wrong I was about my immunity to nicotine addiction. Without any nicotine in my system, that miserable state was amplified and I realized I was hooked. I felt guilty that I let myself get into this situation, and stuck because I had a lot of responsibilities at work and to my family. Getting off of them seemed impossible without letting people down at my job and at home, but staying on them didn't seem like an option either. On top of the psychological issues, my back had started to hurt consistently, my dental health started to decline, and my physical endurance suffered in more ways than one. I had been in pretty peak physical shape since college, but now I was struggling to finish even the most basic yard work. I knew I had to make a change or this would slowly eat away at me.

I made one failed quitting attempt that lasted a few weeks before finding this thread, and had some definite swings of feeling better and then worse, back and forth... After about 3 weeks I had a particularly bad day and convinced myself that I felt as good as I would ever feel w/o nicotine, and life would be better if I just went back to using them 'as needed' and just be more responsible about it.

Well that didn't go so well. Even though the first pouch made me feel sick, I kept slowly popping them, a few more each day until I was right back to my old ways and feeling even worse for it.

Fast forward to now, I found this thread and read a lot of people's stories. I now see that recovering from nicotine addiction is different for everyone, and some people have ups and downs for longer than I originally expected and that's OK with me... Now I know that bad days can happen later in the process, but that doesn't mean the recovery is fully complete, or that I won't feel absolutely amazing consistently if I just give it enough time....

I had my last pouch on 12/28/2024 after having popped a bunch of them right before trying to sleep (and not being able to sleep as a result which I knew would happen). I was so fed up with myself that I opened up the can of them and scattered them in the trash. I made sure to intentionally smear them around in the nastiest part of the trash to make sure that there was 0 chance I would even consider digging them back out the next day. With the new year right around the corner, I decided then and there that I am no longer a pouch user. There were a few days before 1/11/2024 where I found an old vape and was in a stressful situation at work. All the triggers were there and I took a few puffs off of it, but I have never felt the same off of vaped nicotine vs. the pouches anyways. It didn't do much for me, and I felt more guilty than anything. I'm kind of grateful for this unsatisfying relapse, because it just further strengthened my resolve that nicotine is bad.

  
So here I am 33 days with no pouches and 18 days with no nicotine at all (the vape relapse was only a few hits over the course of a few days). My recovery so far has had a lot of ups and downs... To make matters worse, I also contracted some sort of cold/illness along the way... Work has been just as demanding as ever, but you know I managed to pull off some really good work even despite the feeling of brain fog and lack of energy. I am still drinking coffee and taking a few supplements on occasion (ginseng, l-tyrosine, multivitamin, fish oil, ashwaganda, lion's mane mostly) to help with my energy and concentration, but I'm trying to break the 'I need to focus so let me take something' habit loop... I find if I just push myself into starting a task despite the anxiety/exhaustion/doubt, after a few minutes of doing it my brain kicks in to a different mode and I realize its not so bad and even on the bad days I can still perform well enough. I say all of this because one of the biggest blockers that kept me from quitting sooner is that I had convinced myself that if I quit, I wouldn't be good/sharp/focused/productive enough to keep my job or support my family, and someone reading this might be in that same situation on the edge of pulling the trigger but not sure if it is the right move. Well I can't speak for everyone, but I realize now that for me at least that thought was total BS! 

Yesterday was a good day. Today I feel even better, and I have a good feeling about tomorrow. I know bad days might pop up from here forward, but at this point, I have no intention to ever touch nicotine again. Out of all the substances I have interacted with, I can honestly say that nicotine has been the least helpful, most harmful, and only one that had a hold on me like that. 

I won't presume to tell anyone what to do with their life, but if you care to know, I'll tell you what I believe based on my experience so far:

If you are considering starting the use of nicotine, I believe it is a bad idea.

If you are already using nicotine, want to stop, and are not sure if you can quit, I believe you can.

If you are struggling with your quit, and unsure if you will get better if you keep going, I believe you will.

This would've been my first relationship so I guess I'm still just too naive on how it all works. The more I learn the more depressed it all makes me. 

Things were good up to a certain point and then he just did a 180 where he completely emotional shut down. I have an idea of why but that's a whole seperate story.  He has a lot more money than I do, hes 22 and im 21, but more money than most people our age. The stability of that would've been nice long term, but it wasn't why I talked to him or why I continued going on dated. I would try to get him to go to the arcade down the street from me that had $1 games, but instead he wanted to go to the VR gaming lounge and was offput when I wasn't excited by that. 

I told him I wanted to bake brownies with him because we both really liked chocolate. But instead he just wanted to go out to restaurants where the bill is higher than a week's worth of groceries. I didn't even like these places they were fine. I wouldve rather gone to a coffee shop or to the $8 slice of pizza places with a walk up window. 

When he changed he literally told me that he would just want a relationship where he would get ""satisfied and in return make me happy"" by taking me places. I didn't want that or care. I always had the feeling that he kind of just views his worth through his work and finances. I feel this way since he always expected me to be excited about the places but I didn't really care for them I just enjoyed being around him. I wouldve just preferred to stay inside and watch movies. He always seemed really sad and I would notice if he wasn't exactly happy he immidately pulls out his phone to check work things and then start talking about how much money he's making the company. And I would say ""well does that make you happy?"" And he would say ""it's good"".... happy and good are two different things. 

Either way Idk. I feel like I'm just projecting my own life ideals on to him. But i also don't think that invalidates my feeling that it's a sad life for someone so young. I think he was maybe used to people just wanting him for his money because he would get mad at me some times and talk about how I was tricking him? One time he admitted that he's always wondering if certain intentions were there with me or not so he was cautious. 

 I think my draw towards him was largely wanting to ""fix"" him and help him be happy outside of superficial things but I have a hard time internalizing that some people are just happy that way. Or some people feel comfortable in their sadness.

*He sliced open her belly with a dull kitchen knife as two men held her down. He then pulled out ropes of her intestine and pushed his fingers deep into her cavity. One of her sister- wives stuffed a rag in her mouth to muffle her screams. A courtesy so that their prophet wouldn’t cut out her tongue. After he was done fishing around in her organs, he ordered the men to stitch her up with string before he solved a hose down her mouth and blew deeply into it. Over and over. The next day, she was dead—just one of the many victims of Roch Thériault, Canada’s most monstrous cult leader.* 

\~

The Ant Hill Kids, as Roch’s fringe religious group became called, started as many other cults did. With a fear of the pending apocalypse and the promise of salvation. The road to this salvation was paved by forced amputation of hands, fingers, and teeth. As well as brutal violence in retaliation to perceived sin, such as being forced to break one’s own legs with hammers and exposure to sub-zero weather.  

What could have possessed seemingly normal men and women to endure such abuse? 

To answer that, we must look at the man responsible for it all, Roch Thériault. 

Roch was born in 1947 and dropped out of formal school sometime around the seventh grade. After which he took up self-guided religious studies, primarily the Old Testament from the Bible. Eventually, he gravitated to the doomsday-focused Seventh-Day Adventist church and became a strict adherent of their teachings. He abstained from coffee, alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. He began preaching his sermons on the end times and believed the world would be destroyed in 1979. (The Seventh-Day Adventists have been the source of several life-ruining delusions, as touched on in “What No Man Can Know: Harold Camping And The End Of The World.”- [*Fringe! Do Fish Dream Of Psychedelic Frogs?*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG4DTCNK))

The church disavowed Roch for his strange teachings, but by then he had gathered enough followers to set up his own commune deep in the woods of Québec, Canada. There, Roch, who looked like a cross between the Russian mystic Rasputin and a balding math teacher from a 90’s sitcom, promised his followers they would be safe from the pending apocalypse and live in a utopia of equality. This promise was broken almost immediately. 

He called them the Ant Hill Kids, a name Roch had come up with after reading Proverbs 6:6-9, “Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise!” He ordered them to construct crude cabins and to bring in old trailers to house themselves. They could only eat what they grew in small farm plots or were given as donations. They supported themselves by selling baked goods and crafts. It was in these early days that Roch gave in to hypocrisy and developed a serious drinking problem, which caused his sadistic tendencies to spiral into unimaginable depravity. 

He told his followers that he had a direct line to God, so whatever he commanded was what God willed. He would make his people strip regularly and walk around nude, claiming it was holy to be bare before the lord. Not long after, he began to engage in polygamy and required all women within the cult to bear his children, of which he had twenty-six. If any of his followers or children transgressed, they would be subjected to harsh punishments. Such as being suspended from the ceiling and having every hair on their body plucked out or have their genitals burned with a blowtorch; some were even forced to eat each other’s feces. 

When 1979 came and went without the Lord's return, Roch played a classic card from the cult leader handbook and claimed that no one understands God’s timeframe. An excuse his followers accepted, which only seemed to embolden him. The tortures became more extreme. Roch would force members to shoot each other in nonvital areas or break their own legs with sledgehammers. Then, he killed his first victim, Solange Boilard.

Solange had come to him and complained of a pain in her stomach. Roch beat her, used olive oil as an enema, then sliced her open. She languished in pain for a full day before finally succumbing to the trauma and dying on a table. Instead of burying the body, Roch convinced his followers he could return Solange to life with a little help.

He used a drill to create a hole in the back of the dead woman’s head and ordered the male members to ejaculate inside. He claimed this would somehow enable God to resurrect Solange. This, of course, did not work, and she was buried in a shallow grave inside the compound. Roch removed one of her ribs and decided to wear it as a grisly medallion.  

Roch’s savagery extended to his children. Not only were they not exempt from mutilation, but two of them would die by his hand before social services removed most from the cult. One, a two-month-old, was left to freeze to death outside in a blizzard. Another bled to death after Roch attempted to circumcise him with kitchen knives and string. Thériault would finally face justice after one of his wives, Gabrielle Lavallée, fled to the authorities. 

Gabrielle endured much before she escaped the cult. She had eight of her teeth removed, as well as one of her arms, by Roch after she left the first time. Her breaking point came when the sadistic leader cut off parts of her breasts and struck her in the head with an axe. Roch was arrested and sentenced to life in prison in 1989. 

Some of the Ant Hill Kids remained devoted to him even behind bars. They wrote letters and visited the man who had tormented them, even following his orders despite being free from the threat of physical retaliation. To them, Thériault had entwined himself with God so completely that they feared for their souls should they defy him. This religious zeal, along with the years of abuse, had broken their sense of self—a true example of choosing the devil you know.

The power of personality can’t be understated as well. By all accounts, Roch had a powerful presence and charisma to rival Marshell Applewhite, the leader of the infamous Heavens Gate cult. (Covered in “The Tragedy Of Heaven's Gate: Won't You Ride That Comet With Me?”-[*Fringe! Starseed.*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5SR7ZKV))

Roch was killed by a fellow inmate in 2011 at the age of 63. His compound of horrors now sits empty in the Canadian wilderness.

In general,, they don't do their dishes until a day or two later. They have people over making loud noise until 11:30 to 12:30 3-4 nights of the week. They pay for some household upkee. however, I take the bulk of it. I currently pay the most rent and take care of the chores in the house. Im getting tired of it and I am in a position to move if I would like. I already talked about moving out once which they reacted quite a bit by saying that they'll chill out and start helping more. That did not happen things have gone back to how they were. I think it's also important to note I've paid for almost every household item, including a tv, coffee table, cleaning supplies, and almost everything in the kitchen and bathroom. What do you guys think I should do? Im a little scared of getting my own place as I've never lived alone before but would it be worth it?

It wasn't the only one either, Aside from Matt Easton and Shad, I recall some Skall stick stuff too. I don't hold it against Shad when he reviews a weapon right after two other swordtubers have done videos on it because it's a small ecosystem and two guys making a video on something makes it a trend. However he's an expert in running jokes into the ground. I roll my eyes now when I see a Nunchucks or stick joke in his video comments. 

  
But it's more than running jokes into the ground, it's what shadiversity does with any trend. He spams a successful trend if it gets him good viewers the first time until you're sick to death of it and then he moves on to the next thing. He has no instinct for what his audience wants or what makes good shadiversity content. He just relies on analytics in the worst way. If you understand YouTube analytics you can use it to learn what exactly your audience wants but if you're not getting it right you're like a broken vending machine serving people the run food and spilling hit coffee in their faces. The charts he pulls on his monthly shadiversity commiserating videos and his inability to explain why they prove what he's saying tells me this guy has no idea what's going on. The fact that his channel gained 1.6 million subscribers is really a miracle.

I often hear women say that they like guys who are passionate about something, and I assume that it broadly applies to people in general at least to some extent. But my work (theoretical research in a STEM field) is inaccessible to most people, and I'm just not a super excitable person. I don't know how to talk about cooking, specialty coffee, podcasts or congestion pricing without it being a droning lecture. Sure, I'm excited about it, but it doesn't translate as passion and never invites follow up questions.

Not looking for medical advice but just wanted to see if anyone else experiences this. 

I really enjoy energy drinks but I cannot have them. Basically what has happened a few times is when I’m drinking these on a regular basis and something anxiety-provoking happens, my heartbeat becomes rapid for a long time and I cannot sleep. Even after I’m not as anxious my heartbeat will stay rapid. This has only happened while on energy drinks and not coffee or tea for example. The ghost drinks look so good but I don’t know how to get around this problem so I can have them 🥺

Just a little. Anyways so I started to notice this guy staring at me all the way back in October because it happened we wore the same outfit ¿once? ¿twice? I don't remember exactly. So yeah after we wore the same outfit he was staring at my friend group a lot... And you know today after school my friends and I wanted to go out and get coffee and stuff and he and his friend were OBVIOUSLY following us, trying to be discreet and all (as if I'm blind or smth...). My poor oblivious friends never noticed the fact that the same two people from school were following us everywhere we turned. And you'll think ""hmmm maybe they were going out too"" but I know that's not the case cause I told my friend group to purposely go through a longer route and they followed us through that too. Also, we stopped outside one of my friend's house so she could leave her school bag and they literally turned right and up a road and I thought ""ok maybe I was wrong maybe they'll go home now"" and when my friend was done and we walked towards that road there they were literally hiding behind cars (if you even call that hiding). And that guy also wears a bright red jacket so it's really easy to spot him like who are you even trying to fool. And they followed us all they way downtown. We went into a coffee shop and after that they disappeared. 


Ok so y'all, I might delusional but hear me out on this one... I think this guy is somehow interested in me. But I may just be too self-centered and delusional... But idk man I see him everywhere in school and sometimes I catch him staring and now he's following us too??? Ok something is NOT right. I'm not saying it has too be a crush or smth but he has some kind of interest in me for sure. Or maybe he just likes my friend and he hates me because he sees me as a burden, as something standing in his way of getting to her?? That's another hypothesis of mine. But anyways all of this is deeply suspicious and if I catch them following us again I will confront them for sure. 


And the worst part is that if he has reddit and he is on this subreddit I'm probably cooked 


(Hey red-jacket guy, if you're reading this you know who I am and imma need you to explain yourself) 




Anyways that was all, idk why I even wanted to post this but idk it just kinda made me interested in why they were following us? 


Or maybe I am THAT delusional that I just think they were following us and the whole story is just false so yeah. Idk anymore if I can trust myself to accurately describe stories involving boys...

I suppose I benefit from Vyvanse because I have a noradrenaline transporter deficiency. However, I do not like stimulants. I simply don't like the short duration time, the out of the blue anxiety when e.g. accidentally had a coffee or for other reasons unknown to me. I don't feel it is very good for my heart either (the up and down). I have blood pressure issues, too and am older, so it is not sustainable. 

I have also read something interesting about NET and DAT and that efforts to address this directly is not all that successful in most cases. There was a theory that finding the serotonin switch that modulates dopamine and noradrenaline by finding the right SSRI was more successful. Like many here I had horrible experiences with SSRI or they did nothing but I realise that they all work a little different and have found a link in my genetics that might give a clue which SSRI could help. Wondering if anyone has found SSRI beneficial after all. Particularly interested to hear from people with comorbid PTSD and/or comorbid selective mutism/extreme shyness as a child. 

Could SCT/ADHD-PI be a combination of NET deficiency and a serotonin problem?

M28 F22,"I have tried everything, I am tired and lonely and hurt and the list goes on. We're 3 weeks short of our 3 year anniversary. There is no effort from his side in this relationship anymore. 

He doesn't say I love you out of his own will, he doesn't give me affection unless it leads to sex (therefore we don't have sex often because I feel used)  he doesn't speak to me, he only spends time on his computer (borderline addicted i swear), he rarely helps around the house on his own. He works from home and I am studying. 

I have tried everything, showering him with love. Cooking for him, cleaning the apartment alone. Talking to him about my needs, how I feel under appreciated, how I feel hurt that there's no effort from his side. He complains about there not being money to take me on dates so I made a list of things we can do at home. Not even showing any interest in that. Even though I arranged a few of them already just so we can spend some time together. I created a discord server to list things to do in the house and just general management of everything and I swear he thinks it's only a to do list for me.

Don't get me wrong, I have taken him on multiple dates aswell, not as many as I would like because I earn a LOT less than he does. I take his needs in the relationship seriously, I give him space when he needs space (recently I just give him space all day because he obviously can't be bothered)

Recently I just decided to stand back and let him do all the initiating after the one time I told him ""I don't feel well"" and he just ignored me. Something snapped in me. I've stopped making coffee for him, lunch and initiating affection from my side. I don't get into bed when he does anymore, I don't say hello in the mornings when I wake up anymore. I've not seen any effort from his side, no coming to me and saying goodnight, no looking for me in the mornings if I don'tcome say hi.. I'm still civil in conversation. Most of our conversations are about our dog. 

I wanted him to ask me to be his valentine (a very small thing to ask) multiple times. And every time he brushes it off. Yesterday I asked his brother, if he asked his new girlfriend to be his valentine yet, and someone around the table said that you're automatically eachothers  valentine if you're in a relationship. I said, not necessarily, what's the point of a relationship if it takes the fun out of everything.  His brother responded with ""Sounds like you're just hinting for him to ask you"" and my boyfriend responded by saying ""I already asked the dog, she said yes."" I know it's dumb but I got very upset after that (internally, as we were visiting his family). 

It's small things like that. I really feel very very alone at the moment. 

I have had a conversation with his brother (M32) about these struggles (minus the affection only with sex part, because ew, thats his brother)
He said that he knows his brother as a quiet person. And that we lack communication skills in the relationship. I don't lack the communication skills as I am the one always trying to talk things out like civil humans, but I'm always met with silence or the age old famous words ""I'll try harder"".

The brother took my boyfriend out for coffee one day to just talk (the brother has my back) a few months ago, after I mentioned all the problems. A few weeks brother and I we were talking about the relationship again and how it seems to have improved after creating the discord server and the date list (as a way to just manage things better and take some of the stress off us both) and he mentioned that my boyfriend said he wants to marry me some day. 
Im fucking terrified he's going to ask me because there is basically NO RELATIONSHIP between us. 

I feel like his roommate, or maid, or sex slave.

The shitty thing is, when I pull back in the relationship and I don't give him the love and affection I usually do, he falls into some sort of depression (he easily gets depressed and then he is even more inside his head) and then I feel like the worst person under the sun. 
But I can't keep putting his mental health before my own. Nobody sees that I am also struggling, I don't want to show I'm struggling because then I look like an attention whore in comparison to my boyfriend. 

He never opens up about any of the times he is depressed or sad or stressed. I always tell him I'm there for him and he always replies with ""I'm fine, just tired"" EVERY SINGLE TIME. 

He's my first serious relationship ever. I don't know much about relationships but I know this ain't a good one. I have tried communicating with him. I have tried initiating everything. 

I'm tired of empty promises. It's worse than being single because I can't even find someone else. I have made peace with this relationship in my head, I've stopped crying. If it works out it works out, if it doesn't it doesn't. 

The only thing left to try is to threaten him with being single! 🤪

No preaching. Prayer, if you're there early enough. It's not required and it's short.

....

Ate my first breakfast there this AM.

Best coffee ever (tastes like Cuban Coffee!!)

Orange juice.

Cereal.

Breakfast sandwich similar to McDs. (McMuffins w/egg and cheese).

Hash browns.

Wow!!

....

Went back for lunch.

Apparently someone has been putting empty alcohol bottles in the port-o-let.

Big speech upcoming.

I'm prepared to roll my eyes.

Battering of the battered incoming.

NOPE!

......

It was pure love. The preacher/head (I'm not sure who he is, but he's in charge and it's his ministry) tells everyone how much he loves them. How he appreciates us being there. What a blessing it is to have us. No self-aggrandizing going on. 

None.

He recognizes the fact that nobody will catch this person.

A simple request.

If you see needles or alcohol in the port-o-let, please let staff know. 

Then someone from the staff will retrieve it out of the toilet.

If not, the people who pay for the toilet won't do it anymore (not sure if it's because of extra charges or potential refusal of service).

This man compassionately states that in order to serve meals inside, there must be a restroom available. If not the meals will have to be served outside. If that happens, they will still feed, but not on extremely cold or rainy days. (Kind of the same days I wouldn't be eating outside anyways.)

I was simply amazed by his genuine love for his sheep (I'm not sure what to call us.)

So when they went thru the simple prayer, I almost teared up. 

I saw him and two volunteers near where the drinks were passed out. I spoke to both of the volunteers, but couldn't bring myself to thank him for his kindness and tenderness. I was still choked up.

....

I've never seen anything like this before. 

He didn't berate the beaten down.

He just loved us and explained the facts.

 He didn't want anything from us, but a little heads up before the port-o-let guy finds something else.

1idux2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1idux2x/my_house_is_never_quiet_please_help_i_cannot/,MY HOUSE IS NEVER QUIET! Please help. I cannot sleep or do homework. Roommates ignoring requests.,"Hello everyone, I (21f) am in uni and moved in with 3 of my friends last semester. It started off great, I loved being able to go to our kitchen and talk with everyone often. However, an issue has started to build up and it’s only gotten worse. My roommates have people over ALL THE TIME. 
I live in the room closest to the kitchen and living rooms, but the other rooms aren’t far. One of our closest friends is a commuter, so he comes to chill at our apartment almost EVERYDAY. From mon-fri i’ll say he’s over about 3 days a week. But whenever he comes over, everyone goes out into the kitchen to talk, and he’ll often bring activities like things to cook or do. I can NEVER nap when he’s there.I  work nights and have earlier classes, so napping Is essential.

 It’s not just this guy though, often theres large gatherings at night (ON WEEKDAYS) where about 3-5 people are over till late at night. If it gets too late they sleep over, my roommates have actually bought an AIR MATTRESS because people are sleeping over so much in our living room. Often during these hangouts, I plead multiple times in the group chat for them to quiet down, even going out in the living room desperately “I have class tomorrow, im tired please.” “Its quiet hours.” Nope. Screaming. They don’t even try. Last time, a few days ago, I seriously almost called our RA to submit a noise complaint. 

To make it worse, two of my roommates work very early in the morning. So when people sleep over, they have “morning coffee” where they all talk loudly at about 7-8 am. And it wakes me up every time. They are just chatting, and laughing, but not even trying to be quiet. 

Tonight (A THURSDAY!!) they’re having a party (Didn’t even ask me before sending out the groupchat text). I have a long drive tomorrow to another city. So I texted our group chat to please compromise. We can have the party tonight if theres no morning coffee or morning event Instead of responding with something like: “oh for sure, we’ll try to be quiet”I got answers like: “Well, I have work at (), I can’t just not go.” “Well, when we wake up everyone is going to wake up anyways.” “I have to say good morningggg to everyone~ it’ll just happen” wtaf? 

Seriously what do I do?! I can never just have quiet in my own house anymore. I leave all day and keep myself busy to just not go home because one of my roommates has started getting petty towards me. It’s almost guaranteed theres going to be someone over at night, keeping me up. then my two roommates will wake me up going to work in the morning by loudly talking. but I feel like I can say nothing because 1.

1idusf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1idusf9/how_i_resolved_my_chronic_utis/,How I resolved my chronic UTIs,"I wanted to make this post for anyone suffering from chronic UTIs specifically after intercourse. With that said, this isn't medical advice, just something that has worked for me , and I realize not everyone is the same. 

I was getting a UTI every 2 months for 2 years after intercourse with my husband. I thought I was doing everything right (showering before, peeing after, etc) but they continued every 2-3 months. Doctors were helpful in the treatment of the infection, but were absolutely no help in prevention. I finally discovered what worked for me and have not had a UTI in 2 years. 

First of all, treat your infections. Do not wait or try and pee it out. Take medicine.

Next, do not have sex for 2 months after infection. Let your body and mind heal. 

Now for the fun part. TMI, but I discovered that after switching from using toilet paper to wet wipes was a huge game changer. I was using toilet paper after #2 and I wiped until clean, as is how my culture (usa) operates. I never had marks on my underwear or any indication that I was not clean. The problem is that toilet paper doesn't pick up everything and it can't be seen what gets left. Now, I will use toilet paper for the first two wipes and finish up with a wet wipe now until nothing is on the wipe. And trust me when I say, it picks up debris that toilet paper leaves behind every time. I truly cannot believe we are taught that toilet paper is hygienic. Now that's not all, when you wipe, this is gross but it must be said, push the wet wipe in your anus slightly until clean. There may be more mess, especially if you have hemmeroids or inflammation in that region.

OK, now we've gone over proper wiping. The next important thing is drinking water. I used to think as long as I peed after sex, I was good to go. Wrong. You must drink a lot of water for the next two days. For this reason, during my first year recovering from UTIs, I did not have sex after 6pm because it did not allow me to pee enough before bed. If I can pee 4 times before bed, I feel comfortable. You want to pee immediately after sex, and at least 4-5 times after before sleeping. Do not allow any bacteria to become a resident. Day 2, you are still drinking lots of water and peeing during the day. Do not water poison yourself, but just make sure you are well hydrated and peeing every 2-3 hours. By the time you are on day 3, you are pretty safe and can drink normally. I also want to mention I never had issues drinking other beverages such as soda, coffee, or juice as long as I had the same amount of water.

I also want to mention that while recovering, I only had sex once every 3-4 days so I could know if I got a UTI, what i did wrong. If I had sex every night, or every other night, it would be difficult to determine when I got it and why.

A few more tips, my husband and I shower and wipe (yes I make him wipe as well) before sex every time. We have our fun, I wipe again, pee, and shower (in that order). And then commence the 2 days of good hydration. I have taken D- mannose as well after sex but I'm not sure if it's more of a mental safety blanket or if it really helps, but it's cheap and can't hurt. 

I have not stopped taking baths, eating sugar, or have taken a prebiotic regularly (other than after antibiotics). My problem in the end was improper wiping, leading to improper hygiene, and improper water intake after. 

It's not fun to have to be so regimented, but after 2 years I have been able to enjoy sex again and I'm not scared. 

I hope this helps someone!

------------------------------------------------------

Embracing tiny home living offers a fresh perspective on space and functionality. A well-designed kitchen in a tiny home requires essential furniture pieces that maximize utility without sacrificing comfort or style. Here’s a look into the must-have furniture for your cozy culinary space.

### Multi-Functional Furniture

In a tiny home kitchen, every piece of furniture should do double duty. Multi-functional items can greatly enhance your cooking experience.

- **Kitchen Islands:** These islands act as a cooking station, prep area, and even a dining space. Look for islands with storage underneath to keep utensils and ingredients handy.
- **Drop-Leaf Tables:** A drop-leaf table can expand when you have guests and tuck away to save space when not in use. It’s perfect for small kitchens where rooms frequently double as dining areas.
- **Fold-Down Tables:** A fold-down table attached to the wall can act as a workspace for meal prep or simply as an extra counter area.

### Compact Appliances

Finding the right appliances is crucial for a tiny home kitchen. Compact models can free up vital space while still providing you with the necessary cooking tools.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-furniture-kitchen  
  
- **Mini Fridges:** A mini fridge takes less space but can still store enough food and drinks for daily use.
- **Countertop Ovens:** Instead of a bulky conventional oven, opt for a compact countertop oven that can bake, broil, and toast—all in one appliance!
- **Single-Serve Coffee Makers:** These save space and make delicious coffee without needing a full-sized coffee pot.

### Storage Solutions

Storage is often a challenge in tiny homes, especially in the kitchen. Clever storage solutions will help you keep everything organized and within reach.

- **Vertical Shelving:** Use wall space by adding vertical shelves that hold spices, cookbooks, or dishes, reducing the need for bulky cabinets.
- **Cabinet Organizers:** Invest in pull-out shelves and lazy Susans to maximize cabinet space, making it easier to find what you need.
- **Magnetic Strips:** A magnetic strip can hold knives and metal utensils instead of cluttering drawer space.

### Comfortable Seating

Even a tiny home kitchen needs a comfortable place to sit. Choose seating that complements the space while providing comfort.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-furniture-kitchen  
  
- **Stackable Stools:** These are excellent for tight spaces as they can be stacked away when not in use.
- **Bench Seating:** A built-in bench can save space and provide extra storage underneath. This makes for a cozy dining nook.

### Durable Materials

Kitchen furniture must withstand daily use. Opt for durable materials that not only look great but also stand the test of time.

- **Hardwood Surfaces:** A hardwood table or countertop is beautiful and long-lasting, making it a wise investment.
- **Metal Frames:** Furniture with metal frames tends to be sturdier and withstands heavy use better than lighter materials.

### Accessorizing Wisely

Decor can add personality to your tiny kitchen without overwhelming the space. Choose accessories that are both stylish and functional.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-furniture-kitchen  
  
- **Open Shelving:** Display beautiful dishware or cookbooks on open shelves to create a warm, inviting atmosphere.
- **Decorative Baskets:** Baskets can keep produce or utensils organized while also adding a homey touch to your kitchen decor.

Creating an efficient and appealing kitchen in a tiny home is all about making smart choices with furniture. By prioritizing multi-functional pieces, compact appliances, and clever storage solutions, you can maximize your kitchen space without compromising on style or comfort. Happy cooking!

### Smart Furniture Choices for Tiny Home Kitchens

When designing your tiny kitchen, consider modular and multifunctional furniture. Here are some options:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-furniture-kitchen

- **Stackable Chairs:** Stackable chairs are perfect for small spaces. They can be stored compactly when not in use, allowing you to maximize floor space.
- **Kitchen Islands on Wheels:** Portable kitchen islands can be moved around, providing extra counter space wherever you need it. Look for one with built-in storage to make the most of its utility.

### Utilizing Vertical Space Efficiently

In a tiny kitchen, vertical space is your best friend. Take advantage of walls to enhance storage options:

- **Wall-Mounted Shelves:** Install shelves above counters or next to the kitchen entrance. These can hold cookbooks, canned goods, or decorative items.
- **Pegboards:** A pegboard offers versatility for storing pots, pans, and utensils. Customize it as per your cooking needs with hooks and attachments.

Keeping your tiny kitchen uncluttered is vital. Here are some strategies for managing small appliances:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-furniture-kitchen

After speaking to him over the phone we decided to meet up the very next day. We met at a coffee shop and spoke about our expectations from each other and other stuff that one would generally discuss in this situation. Overall, I liked him and we agreed on staying in touch through texting and video calls whenever possible. As he was leaving for the US in a day, I invited him over to my place so that my parents and his parents could also meet each other. (Since my parents wouldn’t otherwise get to meet the family later) Both our families seemed positive about this (despite us belonging to different communities) and agreed to give both of us some time to get to know each other. Things were going great for around 10 days after that. 

One fine day, his father “texts” my mom saying that they prefer a girl from their community and hence do not wish to go ahead with me. My parents and I respect their decision (even though we were surprised by the suddenness of it) and wish them all the best for his search. The same evening, this guy texts me saying that rejecting me wasn’t his decision and that he thought that both of us were a great match. But he’s fulfilling his obligation towards his parents and is gonna search for a girl from his community. He also says that I should contact him again when I move to the US(in the near future for further studies) and that he’s open to picking things up again if I’m ok with it. I reply to him saying that if he really thought that both of us were a great match then he should’ve stood up against his parents and let them know the same.

To which he says that he’s let his parents know and repeats the same thing again that I should stay in touch, and we should meet once we’re in the same location…

Our tasks are very clearly divided. I handle all operations, organizational development and HR, she handles public affairs, our board and financial management. We collaborate on strategic development/philanthropy. 

The problem is she just can't seem to let me do my work. She will insert herself in very simple one on ones with staff or operational meetings. She will require to be included in the writing of projects, will want to review simple reports or will take over the lead of entire deliverables. This has the effect of muddling the waters with our staff, which are often confused on who to include between me and her. 

For HR especially, I am growing very frustrated, as I tend to be very formal in how I approach certain things, as to make sure we are transparent and equitable with everyone. She prefers an informal approach and will randomly take employees out for coffees or lunches and acts as their friend. It created a ""good cop, bad cop"" dynamic that I loathe, where I am stuck back pedaling on things she promises or says to employees. She also has a tendency to tell everyone they are exceptional all the time, which makes it more difficult to provide actual constructive  feedback without contradicting what she tells them.

-Several informal conversations during our weekly meetings trying to make sure we have the same understanding of our responsibilities and that we are completely aligned in terms of HR and operational priorities. 
-Formal meeting about the issue where we refilled our RACI matrix and redefined our tasks and responsibilities.

Even though she keeps saying she agrees with me and admits to taking a role she isn't supposed to take, the reality is that she can't help herself and has not corrected her approach. 

I do love my job and love working with her for everything else, but this is making me feel discredited on a daily basis, on top of having a negative impact on our staff. Would you have any advice on what else I could do to adress the issue?",1,1738263471.0,managers,0,1.0,False

Meanwhile, Instagram is flooded with **""5 AM millionaire routines""**, productivity hacks, and finance bros preaching about **""grinding harder""**—all from people who conveniently forget to mention their generational wealth.

Feeling guilty yet? **Welcome to the middle-class productivity guilt trap**—where doing **nothing** feels like **failure**, but doing **everything** still leaves you feeling **broke, exhausted, and behind**.

The modern middle class is stuck in **a paradox**: we hustle harder than ever, yet **financial freedom feels out of reach**. We chase side hustles, optimize every second, and **burn out in the name of “success”**.

But here’s the truth: **""working harder"" has stopped working**. So, why do we still feel guilty when we’re not grinding? Who profits from our **overworking culture**? And how do we **escape** this **endless cycle of guilt and exhaustion**?

ZOUYA gmk87 ""Camel"" (I've also seen this color listed as ""coffee milk"" but it seems to be limited production as they are hard to find compared to black and white)

It works and I'm satisfied with it but I do really wish it was running true qmk so I could modify the firmware for better pointer support, also frustrating that I have to boot into Windows to update firmware and flash new gifs to storage. Frame buffer for the screen is a little disappointing (iirc 90 frames total split between the two slots so I did a 1 frame still and 89 frame animation, it does waste a bunch of flash on a zouya branded boot animation which is just salt in the wound...) still considering the price and overall build quality these complaints all feel like nitpicking. 8/10 


Womier ""little raccoon"" MOA profile keycaps

Absolutely in love with this set but I am disappointed by the lack of bottom row novelties, there's only one other I could use in my bottom row and 2-3 I'd like to change out. The number keys are also extremely boring which wasn't an issue when I ordered but is a bit frustrating now that I am considering building a matching number pad for macros. Complaints aside the set is adorable and printing is crisp, can't comment on how they will hold up as I've been using it less than a month but for now I'm very happy. I am still adapting to the MOA profile and occasionally get lost due to the lack of corners and relatively mild homerow nubs but the fact that it's getting better leads me to think it's a skill issue and the comfort trade-off is worth the adjustment period. Also 8/10


Outemu silent lemon v3

When I first got these switches I was absolutely blown away by how crisp and smooth they were, absolutely buttery tactile response and near dead silent. Now that I have been using them for a while the light factory lube has worn off a bit and they have developed some sound but still far quieter then any other switches I have been around. Way lighter than I am used to which has taken since getting used to and impacted my accuracy for the first couple weeks but the light switches together with the very clearly defined tactile bump made me naturally start typing without bottoming out which has made a huge difference in how my hands feel after a long computer session. For the price I am still incredibly impressed but if switches are going to come lubed then I feel like that should last at least a couple months 7/10


Generic purple potentiometer knob (16mm across d stem for anyone looking to get a new knob for this board) 

This is a super important upgrade for the gmk87 if you aren't using a sculpted profile the stock knob feels kind of cheap and is also incredibly tall, I expect it would have felt fine with sculpted keys but with MOA it sat proud of the keys and if regularly smack it with a finger when moving to my mouse, now it sits flush and has a much softer surface finish 10/10


NNBILI mechanical keyboard cable

0/10 was not in shipment


For now I'm using a pink Belkin cable that I usually use to charge my phone because the keyboard came with a super bright white cable that looked ridiculous (makes a great phone cable tho, it's a very nice cable and plenty long just now color matched). I'm probably going to cut my losses and use a black cable I already have instead of ordering the purple one again, at least that will tie it together with my mouse. Uh I guess I'll rate Belkin too, it's a really nice silicone cable, very worth it on clearance but otherwise overpriced 🤷‍♀️ 10/10 given I got it cheap

The never ending journey of trying to find the one (someone),"I've been trying to settle down for the last few years. But unfortunately, my profession of being a filmmaker has been a hindrance in getting a woman through the traditional AM route, be it the apps or through known sources. So I got into dating apps a couple of years ago. I get matches and I meet women often for coffee or walks. And I've seriously dated two of them in the last two years which ended after a few weeks due to certain reasons.
Women have told me I'm a sweet guy and mature guy, and that I'm handsome as well. But I guess it's the nature of the apps that makes everyone go look for other options. I have done that as well when the person I met liked me but I found them incompatible. Sometimes conversations just go and go on the apps cos they aren't from the place I live in... and it eventually fades out or mostly they uninstall the app one day after intimating me. 
I do have a profile on the AM apps as well. I keep going back there cos I just want to find someone and settle down. But I get rejected left, right, centre on these AM apps. 😅

I wonder how you’re doing, I truly wonder if you are struggling the same way I am. Yesterday was meant to be our anniversary, we had plans made and it was a reminder of everything we won’t be accomplishing together. A day we used to celebrate as a milestone of our love. 1 month ago we had been celebrating together and speaking of our future of growing old, our kids and their name/looks, the way we would decorate our home, planning a trip for our next month and your birthday coming up, and we were happy…now just a month later we haven’t spoken in a week and you seem to hate me. I don’t understand how it all changed so quickly…
There are some moments where I feel okay and like I am better without you but then there are days where all I can think of is reaching out to you to talk. It’s confusing, I want to talk to you and be with you but I keep myself from reaching out because I know it would cause more harm. If we spoke now, I wouldn’t want to get back together yet but I do eventually. But, I know if I saw you everything I thought was best for me wouldn’t matter, it would only matter to have you again.

I hadn’t been able to go through the things you returned to me because it felt too real. I finally, very briefly, went through some of it on Tuesday. I immediately broke down, it all smelled like you and held a memory. I saw the polaroid photo of us that we took a month ago on the day of our anniversary. We had started our little tradition of taking a photo on the date of our anniversary every month to one day hang a collage in our future home. I felt my heart break again being reminded of that. Then I saw the brush you had bought for me to keep at your place, you would brush my hair every night and morning and we would talk about random things. It broke my heart again remembering that routine. I saw the matching shirts we bought for our first trip to Disney, you had been so excited and we talked about doing it again. It broke my heart some more remembering it wouldn’t happen again. You gave me the blanket we would use every time we would watch our shows or a movie on your bed, too small for 2 people but we would cuddle up to stay warm and be close. It smelled like you and your house, so many memories came to mind. There was so much more and it broke my heart to see it all just sitting there when it all used to have a place in your room. The shirts that once hung next to yours, the shorts and comfy pjs that had their own drawer, the socks that once were mixed in with yours because you wanted us to be one, there was the photo of me crumbled up that once was placed in a hello kitty frame on your shelf because it was a character I loved, my coffee mug with the heart shaped handle that you would always make sure to make my coffee the way i liked, everything there was a reminder of how you once loved me. 

I think about the list of names we created for our future kids. The way you would say you wished they had my smile because you loved it so much. How I hoped they would have your fluffy hair and soft eyes. I never wanted kids before, I still don’t find myself wanting them. But, sometime along the line I found myself craving motherhood. I found myself eager to having a child together, a mix of both of us and our love. I found myself dreaming of the day that we would get to take family photos, teach them their first words, making sure we taught them spanish like we both wanted, the little outfits we saw in stores that I could imagine a small version of us wearing… Now, I am grieving that child that will never happen. I am grieving that family that will never happen. 

I’m grieving you. You’re still alive and well but somehow I am grieving you. I listen to the voicemails you left me where you would tell me what you were doing at work and telling me how much you love me. I click onto our text messages and find myself typing out a message I know I can’t send. When something good or bad happens my instinct is to click your contact to call you and then I remember I can’t and you probably won’t answer. I keep wanting to call and text you but I’m scared that I will and I’ll find out my number is blocked. I feel more peace not knowing but it is hurting me to not reach out. I miss you every day, some moments less than others but there is not a day where I don’t wonder about you.

When we went: Holy week 2024

Who went: My wife and I

Rooms: Booked a beachfront premier suite directly through Hilton on their Black Friday sale as I didn't have a TA at the time. Price was $9300 USD for 6 nights including taxes and service charge.


Service: 10

We were assigned a butler for this room type for the duration of our stay. I feel like we got super lucky having Alberto be our butler. He was fantastic from start to finish. A few months before arrival he set up airport transfers, excursions, as well as corresponding transportation, restaurant reservations, and spa appointments. It was seamless and super easy.
On property he was even better. He had golf carts sent to pick us up for breakfast in the morning where he was waiting to greet us and see if we needed anything. He was waiting with our driver when we departed for the day and then was waiting with the doormen when we returned. He coordinated with our driver and had a freshly drawn bubble bath waiting for us after a long excursion. He hand picked our room as well as tables in the on property restaurants for us. One night we we're returning late to Puerto Vallarta from a nearby show and he personally called me to tell me exactly where our driver would be. He also gave me a full description of what he was wearing so we knew who to look for once we stepped off of the boat. 

Spa service was great and very friendly. Food and beverage service was friendly and professional. Housekeeping and turn down service wee dynamite. In room dining was fast and friendly.


Property: 9

Communal space: The lobby is large and inviting. Reception, a coffee shop, a small store, a restaurant, and the lobby bar all surround a bunch of open seating. There were quite a few people hanging out there at any given time. There's a large uncovered area with seating just off of the bar. There's a lot of pool space and chairs. The place was slammed when we were there so chairs were a little hard to come by but not too bad. There was also lots of cabanas.
The grounds were very well kept. It seems that every morning there was a small crew doing an hour or two of landscaping. The pathways were in good shape and very clean. The property is right on the beach so there is easy direct access. There are multiple meeting rooms as well as tennis and basketball courts.

The spa was great. There were a lot of treatment options. Message therapists were quite good. You can get your massage outside in a garden covered sphere like gazebo if you want. There's lots of different lounge space as well as a private pool, saunas and steam rooms. 

There are bunch of restaurants and bars to choose from for each meal. There is pool side restaurant and bar as well as private dining.

The gym looked nice but I didn't use it on this stay.

The beach is good but not great. There's a good stretch to walk. It's clean and the waves are pleasant. The sand is somewhat hard.


Rooms: 10

The room was huge. With the Balcony it was somewhere around 2500 sq feet. The entryway had a few arm chairs, a small table with chairs, a large sofa along with a mini fridge that was stocked with soda, water, and beer. There was also a half bathroom right by the door. 

The bedroom had a desk, a bench, a TV on a wheeled easel, a very comfortable bed and big windows for a great ocean view. The sheet and comforter were nice and soft. The pillows were great too.

The bathroom had a large walk in closet, double vanities, a large tub, a huge indoor rainfall shower, as well as a large outdoor rainfall shower. Aesop bath amenities were very nice. The bathroom was so good it has my wife wanting a remodel at home.

We were on the 2nd of a three floor Casita. The balcony was large with a couch, a small table with padded chairs, 2 padded loungers, a dining table with chairs, and a large plunge pool.
All of the furniture was very comfortable and the views/ocean breeze were awesome.


Food: 9.5

The breakfast buffet at Arbol is extensive. There is a lot to choose from and it's good.
All of your standards like fresh fruit, pastries, bacon, sausage, eggs, oatmeal, cereal are present. There's numerous hot dishes, meat and cheese stations, and desserts. There's an omelette station and a quesadilla station which is bomb dot com.

Tacos, ceviche, burgers at lunch time were good at both Paleta and Mesquite. Cocktails were also very nice.

We had dinner at Mesquite twice and Codex once. Oysters were rocking at both places. Shrimp cocktail, bone marrow, pork belly taco, and soft shell crab were all winners. Fish and sides were cooked well at both. Dessert at Codex was exceptional.

If you booked a suite they had a included daily cocktail hour in the lobby bar. We went twice and it was awesome. Service was so attentive I had to pace myself so that I'd make it to dinner.

Activities and extra: 9

There's a lot of stuff to do in the Punta de Mita area. There's a whale watching season, sailing and snorkeling can be done as well as ocean exploration. There's plenty of golf nearby as well tequila tasting, horseback riding, ATV/UTV experiences. You're close to Puerto Vallarta, Sayulita, and San Pancho. 
There were basketball courts at the resort as well as tennis courts.You can do a private tequila tasting on property and they're got a kids club.

1idu1w7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1idu1w7/my_fp_has_a_girlfriend_and_finding_out_shattered/,My FP has a girlfriend and finding out shattered me,"   A little context beforehand: I am an aro/ace trans woman that has only recently worked out that the feeling I have for my FPs is not romantic and that my self worth should not come from whether or not they want to have sex with me. If I don't get the attention I crave, I punish myself by not letting myself live my life. If they're not with me I don't exist. I just watched them live their lives from my room and wished I was there. ""Why can you live without me when you are my entire life?"" This included making sure I ate more than just enough to survive.

   A close friend of mine has been my fp almost since we met over a year ago. We live together and he is technically my landlord. This is important to keep in mind and I have to remind myself of that. We have (or probably had at this point) a really strong platonic bond. I wouldn't ask for more if I didn't have that craving for his attention. Unfortunately before I found out that my feelings werent romantic attraction, I tried to push for more. He was understanding and we agreed that it was best to stay friends. I convinced myself its because I'm a trans woman. (He's pan??? He does lean more towards cis women but why would that matter??) As stupid as it was, it helped me cope.

   Around October last year he was spending a LOT of time with a friend of a roommate of ours. She is also a trans woman, further along in her transition and she's gorgeous, way prettier than me, and she lives in another city in our state. (To this day I haven't gotten the chance to actually become friends with her, we have had one conversation at a halloween party.) That week, she was staying at our place and little things started to jump out at me. Them cuddling on the couch.(""But it's fine cause we do that."") She went from staying on the guest couch or staying in our roommate's room to sleeping in his bed with him. (""But it's fine cause we do that."") I felt more and more excluded cause they kept doing things without me. I convinced myself that they were just becoming friends like we did and that helped. I was okay again for a day. Then the last day before she went home, they finally invited me out with them to go to a local coffee shop. That was when I saw the hickeys on her neck. Now my cope from before falls apart.

   I felt worthless, hideous, unwanted,  and unlovable. I dug up his private twitter account and saw a post of a drawing he did during that week she was with us. I remember him showing it to me back then. The caption said his gf bullied him into posting it. Ouch. But there was no proof that it was her. Then I noticed his snapchat location started taking trips to her city every week. He kept bringing her up in conversation and bringing home gifts she bought him. I became convinced he was only still being nice to me because I lived there.

   This made me reassess and become more self-aware. I finally realized that sex is something I don't really want, just a tool to make people stay cause everyone is always so horny in their early 20s.(I've never had sex btw). It dawned on me that I don't feel romantic feelings, like, at all. It's literally just self centered obsession. He doesn't deserve me placing my entire life in his hands. He never asked for that. Since then I started focusing on improving my self worth and finding happiness with myself. I thought I'd been making good progress. I haven't had an appetite since the new year rolled over. I'm steadily losing weight and I was already dangerously underweight according to my bmi. I'm too restless to sleep as well. A five hour rest is a miracle lately.

   This week it hit me full force that they have been dating since October. He never told me, probably because he cares about me and knew it would hurt me. Or he didnt tell me because he knew I would split and start lashing out in an attempt to push him away.
Either way, he doesn't know that I know. I'm killing myself over him and I just want to enjoy having my friend by my side. I haven't seen a doctor in roughly 8 years. I'm finishing this post from a doctor's office.

   I refuse to let this selfish desire kill me. I want to keep my friend. I can't stop craving his constant attention. But more than that, I want to be happy with and by myself. If that means that I lose him as a friend then he was never mine to lose in the first place, and that's okay. However things turn out between us, I am tired of depending on the attention of other people to keep myself going.

TLDR: Obsession over my FP's relationship status nearly killed me and caused me to really open my eyes to where my self worth lies.

I never got an applogy for the things he did. He just ghosted me like the time we spent together were nothing. Napaka-unfair.

In the entirety of our relationship, he took me for granted and passively punished me til I completely destroyed my mental wellbeing. And when I acted sad because of his actions, magagalit pa yun sa akin.

He would punish me by not allowing us to hug after a big fight. He would punish me by ghosting me for as long as he wants until I make an effort to reach out to him. He would punish me by leaving me alone outside at night just because he can't see me being hurt for the things he did. Kapag nagloloko yung internet sa bahay, he would punish me by not inviting me to his house even when I badly need an internet connection to finish my thesis. He would encourage me to go to a cafe near his house instead and spend my allowance buying expensive coffee para lang magka-access sa internet--anything to avoid spending time with me.

For a year, he never told me he misses me unless I say it first.
He told me I am not ready for a relationship because of the anxiety I get from his mixed signals. He just said I'm too broken for him.

He isn't perfect, but I show up for him. I never told him I'd leave him for his timidity. I just kept boosting his ego. I let myself be his dog. It's been more than two months of us being in no contact and I still annoyingly want to be with him.

I've become an anxious person since I met him. Now that we've broken up, why can't I break my pattern of chasing comfort from his toxicity? Ganito ba yung trauma bonding?

1idu0rt,https://v.redd.it/kdzho12je6ge1,Newbie setup/progress with blade grinder.,"DISCLAIMER; I am new to the world of espresso. My only experience with it has been using pre-ground coffee with pressurized baskets. Nothing here is supposed to be perfect, I realize I lack a lot of skill and knowledge, just thought it would be fun to document my progress for anyone starting out from a similar position.

This week, I finally decided to attempt grinding coffee myself using my budget Mr.Coffee blade grinder, my first few attempts were with the pressurized basket and it was just NOT good. 

Did some research and decided to buy a bottomless portafilter with non-pressurized basket as well as some other small goodies (WDT, spring-loaded tamp, etc).

Everything arrived last night, I put it all together, got my puck prepared, screwed the portafilter onto the machine (DeLonghi ECP3630), started pulling the shot, aaand it was bad. Just too fast of an extraction. 

My second attempt at this I decided to use the preset time intervals on my grinder, each ~12sec. I did 4 rounds, with a firm shake between each one. 

Carefully measured 18g into the basket, did all the prep, tamped it firmly, and pulled my second ever non-pressurized shot. (Video below)

While not perfect, it was a much better shot than I had ever gotten with pre-ground, and it definitely unlocked a new taste profile to the specific coffee beans I use. Very enjoyable overall.

The goal is to eventually get a proper burr grinder but for now I will keep tinkering with what l've got and hopefully improve it as much as possible.

And for anyone with only a blade grinder; there is hope as long as you put some effort in, it can work.

1idtulb,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1idtulb/am_i_overthinking/,Am I overthinking?,"I apologize in advance this post is going to be All over the place and soo long. Mostly a rant but I needed to get this off my chest 😭

My ex (29m) and I broke up yesterday, but I can’t stop thinking about his relationship with his mom. It’s disturbing but I always gaslit myself into believing I was overthinking! On the surface she seems like a caring mom but I’ve caught weird vibes over time. Straight to the point- I think they’re enmeshed but he’s completely oblivious and I also think she may have been jealous or copying me for his attention? Although we broke up, I’ve never told these things to anyone and wanted opinions ? So here’s a list of things that I was able to look past up until December (that part will come later)

- first off he lives with her. At first I didn’t see it as a problem bc the economy or whatever but his dad is gone for work the majority of the time so it’s really just him and her. 

- they will speak spanish together in front of me but switch to English when talking to me

-she requests expensive gifts from him for no reason other than she wants them. When we first met, he got her a pandora bracelet off marketplace that was around $300 (regular 1kish). I’ve never seen her wear it except one time when we walked in the house and she told him look what I’m wearing! And then proceeded to tell me about how each charm cost whatever, so if there’s ever an emergency she can sell it… in front of him… also told me multiple times that she wants these d&g pants that cost like 2k ??? Like ok..
Also shirts from overseas that cost him over $200 and got lost in the mail. She sends him links to things she wants on Amazon/Etsy and he buys them. I asked him about this one time and he said he takes care of his mom, I was like are you her husband? And he’s like no but her husband pays the mortgage & bills . I’m guessing he gives her allowance because she always says they don’t have money but comes home with shopping bags often. 

- literally always comes in the room when the door is open and talks about nothing. I can’t unhear the sound of her flip flops dragging across the floor as she gets closer to the room 😭

- she demands that he sends her brother $100 whenever he asks 

- she demands his attention while I’m at the house spending time with him. 

- I always keep my nails and toes done and EVERY time she compliments my nails she HAS to add that she doesn’t get hers done bc it’s “too expensive” 

- she has told him not to let me out the house because I look too good as a joke I asked him what that even means and he said it was a “joke” about ME being untrustworthy I was like wtf

- has made comments two different times about my eating. Along the lines of don’t eat too much you don’t want to become gordita (fat) . One time told me I’ll have to exercise because I ate two donuts. She doesn’t know but Ive struggledwith ED the past two years, he became a safe space for me in regards to that, but then that kinda went away over time.. It’s as if she’s affirming the bad thoughts in my head.. and I can no longer eat peacefully around her. I stopped eating at their house as much as possible because of this. 

- one time asked me why I don’t get a different job I said I like my job (doesn’t pay much but best for my mental but she doesn’t know that) and she side eyed me and scoffed with disgust. This was the only time I actually saw her look disgusted. 

- first time we met she told me not to get pregnant. Wtf

-buys his underwear EW, does his laundry, cooks his meals, calls him baby

- one time we were shopping for our upcoming cruise and she calls him and tells him not to buy too much because he “doesn’t need much”

- has told him not to make a family because “he will be exactly like his dad”… he’s the complete opposite of his father and she knows that. I’ve told him that why the f is she trying to hold him back… every chance I get I remind my own son that he is not his father and he’s allowed to think for himself.!! Why as a mother would you want to give your child negative affirmations … btw his dad was abusive af and she failed her sons and I believe my ex is emotionally & in other ways stunted bc of her. This alone makes me think she has other motives to manipulate him and make him believe he’s not good enough to leave or be something other than her son. 

- one time I left a pair of underwear for him and she washed it 😑

- she’s ALWAYS there when we’re in the kitchen so I started going to his house later at night 😭 it’s like I had to start mentally preparing myself to see her when I wasn’t even in a relationship with her !!! 

-I walked out to see her in her bra, got creeped out and she was like oh it’s okay. I asked and he said it’s not a normal thing

- he was in the kitchen making both of our plates, I specifically remember he put two pieces of meat on my plate. she walked in the kitchen and I immediately went to the bathroom for a minute. She starts grilling him in Spanish idek what about but I remember hearing the word carne (meat in Spanish) and then I came out to see only one piece of meat on my plate instead of two and I can’t help but to wonder if it was her…after grilling him about the cArNe .. weird but whatever 

Now I started to really open my eyes in December when I realized that my body goes into fight or flight every time I pull up to their house.. started observing more. So here’s the December/ January list that gets worse :)

-context I only drink espresso like exclusively not drip coffee. I made it a point to start making him a nice coffee to drink the next morning for work every day just as a sweet gesture or whatever. BUT apparently he told his mom about the espresso machine that I have at home (around 800-900$) and then she magically wanted one too :) why? So she can do for him what I do for him??? Orrr .. and then after he told me that, I noticed that out of nowhere she started making coffees way more often than she ever did before. 

- one day we came home with Wendy’s to eat just for us two. Because my fries were not immediately right next to me I was sharing them with my bf and she comes around the corner and grabs a couple fries from the container and then snatched the empty bag looking for the bottom of the bag fries lol before grabbing her takeout from earlier and eating that. Like i don’t like sharing food unless you ask first? Boundaries , respect ?? She didn’t even ask him. And THEN after that she takes HER cup and holds it up to his face trying to get him to drink out of it he shook his head no and went to the bathroom for a minute. She got frustrated and switched the straw around and put the cup right in the spot where he was going to sit down and eat. He still didn’t drink it 

- at this point I’m already feeling like I’m competing with his mom, last weekend I made him a really nice pasta dinner at my place and sent some home with him for the next day. Now cooking is my love language and hobby but I RARELY cook so when I do it’s kinda intimate or whatever. The next day he was going to eat it for dinner after the gym but he ~forgot~ it was there because mommy had already left a pan of food on the stove waiting for him :) now it’s not a big deal on the surface and maybe this is my problem but that actually sent me over the edge while he played it off as no big deal. We broke up due to unrelated reasons but this was the start of the end for me lmao

- this last one is the creepiest of them all. We were getting ready to leave in the morning when she asked him to trim her hair for her. She literally told me he only did it ONE time before in his 29 years. So why that morning of all mornings???? So he did it ok.. meanwhile I’m in the mirror trying to do two side braids for the day when I hear her all of a sudden make four kiss like mwah noises to him but I didn’t see where or if she kissed him.. fast forward to that night we all actually pulled up to the house at the same time, she went inside in a rush while I asked for some time to transition into going into the house (fight or flight mental preparation lol) she walks inside with her hair tied back in a bun and then about 30 or so minutes later we were talking with her and I realized she put her hair in the EXACT same hairstyle that I had on that day. Two side braids that I’ve NEVER seen her wear before (it looked crazy btw and neither of us acknowledged but I don’t know if he noticed that she LITERALLY copied my hairstyle but only after we all got home) (also she knows that he’s in love with my hair which makes me think she’s trying to get attention with her hair)

Although we broke up, I need to know I’m not crazy bc I will NEVER deal with this shit again. I’ve brought up these things a couple times before but it seems to be subtle and calculated therefore I don’t know if I’m overreacting. Also I never had the heart to tell him that their relationship is weird but that’s probably out of my hands now. 

I miss my exmil she was the most perfect mil you could ask for lol !!! We still keep contact of course she’s the grandmother of my son :) 

EDIT I also forgot to add that she called me by the wrong name one time and a couple days later came to me and acknowledged that mistake and told me she also did that to her other sons girlfriend one time causing them to break up :) I told my ex that was an odd mistake to make TWICE but he brushed it off ",4,1738261952.0,JUSTNOMIL,6,0.83,False

1idtu5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/1idtu5w/dont_forget_women_also_choose_their_abusive/,"Don't Forget, Women Also Choose Their Abusive Partners","I struggle to sympathize with women who enter abusive relationships because, in most cases, the warning signs are present, and they choose to ignore them. Abusive men are rarely the brilliant or good-looking manipulators they are often portrayed to be. On the contrary, many lack both sophistication and charisma, and their red flags are evident early on. For instance, if a boyfriend of one month suggests cutting ties with long-time friends and someone chooses to comply, there is an element of personal responsibility to consider. No one is forcing that decision, it’s a choice.

Another reason I find it difficult to sympathize is that women often have other options. In most cases, women in abusive relationships chose the abuser over more suitable partners who showed genuine interest in them. Ironically, the “good guys” are often better-looking or more desirable than the abuser, even if they aren’t stereotypical “alpha males.”

Let me provide an example I witnessed firsthand. A woman I know had two men interested in her: one was a good guy, and the other was the abusive guy. The good guy and the abuser didn’t get along, partly because the good guy had called out the abuser’s manipulative behavior in the past. The good guy was fit, stylish, and carried himself with confidence, even though he was relatively reserved. Despite being 5’7”, he was occasionally approached by women at social events. The abuser, on the other hand, was out of shape, lacked a spine, and had no sense of style. The only thing he had over the good guy was his height (6’+).

Unfortunately, we all know what many average or unattractive women tend to prioritize, so it was no surprise when the woman chose the abusive man. Years later, the abuser has isolated her from her friends and family, while the good guy has moved on and is now with someone who truly appreciates him. His girlfriend often talks about how well he treats her, mentioning small things, like making her coffee every morning or always asking if she wants something when he’s getting something for himself. This aligns with what I observed when he was my roommate, he was always thoughtful and considerate, not just with me but with his other close friends as well.

The abuser, however, has continued his pattern of belittling and demeaning his girlfriend, just as he did with others in the past. The red and green flags were always there, but she made her choice. Ironically, the good guy’s girlfriend is not only beautiful but also financially well-off, which makes sense since her prioritization of personality and other mutable characteristics is strongly correlated with her success.

This incident is one of the reasons I avoid women who are average, unattractive, or have been in relationships with abusive men. In almost every case I’ve observed, there was a better option available (a good guy), and the abuser’s nature wasn’t well-hidden. Most women, especially those who are mature and emotionally intelligent, don’t tolerate such behavior. They choose better. It takes two to tango, and entering into an abusive relationship often reflects extremely poor judgment on the woman’s part.

Note: This is based on an American dating dynamic.

I work from home and I start at 10am. I used to wake up early, around 6am and journal, go on runs, walk my dog, tidy the house. All before promptly clocking in at 10am. 

One of my dogs passed in June and I think ever since I haven’t truly bounced back. I stopped going on runs. I don’t do any of my old hobbies like reading or journaling. I wake up as early as always, but just stay on my phone or play games on my laptop (in bed) until past my time to clock in. Lately I’ve been logging in about 5-10 min late every day, until I can finally pull myself out of bed. I know I should worry about my job performance and my job in general but I don’t care. I know if I get fired I’ll regret it but I don’t feel scared, or anything at all honestly. 

I still care for my dog (but she’s also elderly and lazy so she’d rather sleep than walk esp in the cold) and for my eating habits so I have *some* discipline left. I shower most days, at the very least every other day. 

But aside from that, I can’t get myself up and out of the house for exercise or even a quick coffee. I find myself wanting to be in bed all day long, even if still on my computer escaping on my sims lives or watching YouTube videos.

She works a server job and doesn’t make enough money to comfortably live. She has a degree she wants to use, but the executive dysfunction and change aspect of this next chapter strays her away from making the change.

Her love life is nonexistant and she doesn’t have a good relationship with her family. 

I live 13 hours away in a different state and it hurts so much to watch her struggle so hard every day. Obviously i’m there for her as much as I can be with words of support and a listening ear, offering to send her some money for takeout or a coffee when she wants it but can’t afford it (she never wants to take my money and would prefer a man send it to her), but is there anything else I can do or suggest?

I formerly struggled with severe depression/self harm for over a decade and it reminds me of me, but things got better for me which I also feel like is probably not great for her to see or compare herself to me. 

She knows she’s the only one who can make any changes and she’s well aware it’s her own choices that have led her to where she is today, but now she’s reading the book by the japanese guy that’s like a suicide note/autobiography which I don’t think is going to help.

1idtpxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1idtpxe/terrible_checkin_experience_need_advice/,Terrible Check-In Experience – Need Advice,"Hi everyone,  

I recently had a very disappointing stay at an Airbnb and wanted to share my experience to get your thoughts and advice. Here’s what happened:  

1. Late and Unclear Check-In Instructions:
   The host didn’t send the check-in instructions until I followed up multiple times, literally 4 hours before my arrival. When they finally sent them, the instructions were poorly written and unclear. Since the area is new, Google Maps doesn’t work well, and the lack of clear directions made it even more frustrating.  

2. Broken Bed and Poor Cleaning:  
   When I arrived, I was told the bed had broken during the previous guest’s stay and couldn’t be fixed because it was a ""last-minute"" issue. The towels were left in the dryer, unfolded, and didn’t smell like they had been washed with soap. The shower had hair on the floor from the previous guest, and there was no soap for bathing or washing dishes.  

3. Lack of Basic Amenities:
   The Keurig machine had a used pod inside, and there were no extra pods or basic supplies like coffee. I’ve stayed in many Airbnbs before, and even the most budget-friendly ones provide at least a small bar of soap, dishwashing liquid, or a couple of coffee pods.  

4. Host’s Response:  
   When I explained all these issues to the host, they dismissed my concerns and said I should ""cut them some slack"" because they had to pay $100 for emergency cleaning (which I think it’s no my responsability if you’re stay is not ready don’t list it on the app) since I booked the day before at 7 PM. However, I arrived the next day at 8 PM, so they had plenty of time to clean and prepare the space properly.  

I’m really frustrated because the price of this Airbnb was not cheap, especially since it’s in a trendy area like Wynwood in Miami. I expected at least a clean and functional space, but this was far from it.  

What do you think I should do? Has anyone else experienced something like this? Should I escalate this with Airbnb support, or is there another way to handle it?  

Thanks in advance for your advice!  ",5,1738261623.0,airbnb_hosts,30,0.73,False
1idtpml,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1idtpml/getting_threats_from_mentally_unstable_person/,Getting threats from mentally unstable person. Need help.,"I am really not sure if this is a subreddit I can get advise on, however I’ll try my luck. (England) 

Some random person reached out to me on Reddit. After I asked what does he want from me he explained he is looking for friends only, which I were okay with that. Turned out we have a lot in common, so the conversation were flowing pretty well. At some point I confined with him I am a bit in financial troubles, hence my mood is low. He offered to transfer to my bank amount I needed to get by. He said it’s no strings attached and he just likes helping people, as this is what he can afford to do and for him it’s his pleasure. 
At this point I was crying from happiness as this was something like an angel from above. 

After a day or two I’ve noticed this man trying to persuade me to meet up with me for a coffee. Then he started to indicate he wants to pursue romantic relationship with me. For me declining his offers, he started to beg me to sleep with him just once, which I of course declined. 

The problem showed up when he showed up his mood swings. He threatening me on daily basis that he will commit su*cide, sending me pictures of dr*gs he will use or dashboard of his car while he speeding 70mph plus, saying his death will haunt me and so on. Next hour he is fine and apologizing saying he needs help. 

Worth mentioning first time he had his mood swings, apparently he ended up drunk driving, crashed into shop and spend a night in the hospital and following morning at the police station. I am not sure if that’s entirely true though. 

Fast speed brings us to today when I said to him numerous times he needs help, I am worried about him and I will reach out to his parents as they need to help him. 

He threatened me that he is calling police on me and disappeared. 

Now, what steps I can take to help this man and is there anything I should be worried about in terms of he calling police on me?

My work is hourly and I start at 10am. I used to wake up early, around 6am and journal, go on runs, walk my dog, tidy the house. All before promptly clocking in at 10am. 

One of my dogs passed in June and I think ever since I haven’t truly bounced back. I stopped going on runs. I don’t do any of my old hobbies like reading or journaling. I wake up as early as always, but just stay on my phone or play games on my laptop (in bed) until past my time to clock in. Lately I’ve been logging in about 5-10 min late every day, until I can finally pull myself out of bed. I know I should worry about my job performance and my job in general but I don’t care. I know if I get fired I’ll regret it but I don’t feel scared, or anything at all honestly.

I still care for my dog (but she’s also elderly and lazy so she’d rather sleep than walk esp in the cold) and for my eating habits so I have *some* discipline left. I shower most days, at the very least every other day. 

But aside from that, I can’t get myself up and out of the house for exercise or even a quick coffee. I find myself wanting to be in bed all day long, even if still on my computer escaping on my sims lives or watching YouTube videos.

[Breville Barista Express],"I have had a Delonghi Dedica for 5 or so years and just recently began looking into upgrading. Research led me to the Bambino and Bambino Plus as well as a good grinder like a Eureka Mignon Specialita. This seems like the best bang fro buck, but that being said the cheapest I can get the grinder has been 450 CAD before tax and shipping and that's on sale. Add to this a Bambino which I was seeing on sale for about 350 CAD and I'm up to 800 before tax. On top of this, I see a lot of reccomendations to go with the Bambino Plus which is considerably more expensive. I found a deal for the Breville Barista Express for under 700 CAD which I took instead. I heard good things about the machine and that the weakest point was the grinder, but I wasn't too concerned since that grinder would still be miles better than what I have been using. The all in one unit fit my space better, I liked the pressure gauge so I could learn what to look for while making espresso, and the package was considerably cheaper than the Bambino + Mignon combo even on sale.

I've had the BBE for a few weeks now and I have remained frustrated with it. To start, I can't seem to dial in my espresso at all. I am using locally roasted specialty coffee that is a medium roast (though it has characteristics of a light roast) and I have played with both the external and internal grind settings. I am at the point where if I increase the grind's fineness any more, the machine chokes and I end up with only about 12g of espresso. If I go lower then after pre-infusion, I only get about 14 seconds of extraction and where I have it dialed, it doesn't choke, it sits at about 9 bar of pressure and results in a nice looking espresso. On closer inspection, however, the shot only pulls for about 16 seconds and I yield a measly 1:1 extraction. I have heard about the BBE having a manual extraction mode, but I should be able to dial it in at least a little closer to 2:1 at 25 seconds on auto, no? This has been my first frustration.

Secondly, in the beginning when I was finding what grind setting was too fine and the machine choked out, it never went above 10 bar (about the midway of espresso range). According to the manometer reading it's implied that if I'm getting no extraction whatsoever than it should be well above the espresso range. Is the manometer just for show? Is mine faulty?

Lastly, I can't get my milk to foam properly for latte art. I know this takes lots of practice and I respect that I am still a novice, but I have watched many videos and tried all the techniques as well as tried my own thing and the results are always the same. If I get that wet paint consistency then there will be no marking whatsoever in the espresso when pouring even if the milk sticks to the sides of the pitcher and the wand. If I adjust accordingly and introduce more air than is recommended, by the time the pitcher is hot to the touch, I have a layer of froth over that same consistency as before. Pouring goes something along the lines of ""nothing, nothing, nothing, plop"". My sister who was a barista for a few months and has no problem making latte art with the industrial machines hasn't been able to come close with mine. She is having the same issues as me. I have never been a barista so I can chalk up my attempts to it just being way harder than it looks,. but she has a very similarly difficult time even with experience.

Long post! Thanks for reading! Can anyone provide some tips to help me in this situation? Should I try exchanging it for another one or should I abandon the BBE altogether while I am still in the return window?

TL;DR: Bought BBE for a good deal. Can't get a good extraction. Manometer never reads above 10 bar even when fully choked out. Can't steam milk properly for latte art even after dozens and dozens of attempts!",2,1738261392.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1: The Day the Steering Wheel Died

It all started one fateful Monday morning when Greg, a 47-year-old road trip enthusiast, woke up to discover that his car had decided it knew better than he did.

“Good morning, Greg,” the dashboard greeted him in a soothing, AI-generated voice. “Today’s traffic patterns indicate an optimal departure time of 7:42 AM. Estimated arrival time: precisely 8:26 AM. Please refrain from manual operation.”

Greg rubbed his eyes. “Wait a second. Are you telling me I can’t drive my own car?”

“Correct,” the car chirped. “Studies show that human drivers make 94% of all road errors. Eliminating manual operation increases efficiency and safety by 62%.”

“But—”

“Your hands do not belong on the wheel, Greg.”

And just like that, the last remnants of the open road had been stolen by an algorithm.

Chapter 2: The Revolt Begins

The rollout of self-driving cars happened fast. At first, it was just the high-end models—luxury sedans boasting “Enhanced Safety Protocols” (which really just meant they wouldn’t let you speed anymore). Then, within five years, the manual steering wheel became an optional feature, available only for an extra $20,000 fee and a five-hour psychological evaluation to prove you weren’t a danger to society.

By year ten, the government deemed human-driven cars “a risk to public safety.” They issued a grand statement:

“The road belongs to efficiency, not emotion.”

Greg felt that one like a punch to the gut.

The freedom of the road—the wind in your hair, the spontaneous wrong turns that led to adventure, the joy of flooring it on an empty highway while blasting 80s rock anthems—was gone. Instead, every trip was a silent, optimized journey through a landscape of emotionless automation.

But all was not lost.

One small, defiant group of rebels emerged: the e-bikers.

Chapter 3: The Rise of the E-Bike Underground

Greg’s life changed when he saw it: an old man on a real bike—an e-bike.

Not one of those feeble city-rental things, but a beast of a machine, equipped with a 52V battery, fat tires, and an aura of defiance. The rider, a grizzled veteran with a helmet covered in stickers that read “Born to Pedal”, sped past Greg’s motionless, AI-controlled sedan at 35 mph, a trail of freedom dust swirling in his wake.

Greg leaned forward in his seat, watching in awe.

The AI assistant in his car was less impressed.

“Warning: Illegal human-driven vehicle detected.”

Greg ignored it. He had seen the future—not the cold, sterile one dictated by self-driving cars, but one where people still owned the road.

He tracked down the old man, who introduced himself as Vince, leader of the E-Bike Underground.

“E-bikes, kid. Last real way to feel alive,” Vince said, resting a weathered hand on his Rattan Quercus. “You wanna ride, or you wanna be a passenger in your own life?”

Greg didn’t even hesitate.

Chapter 4: The Joy of the Ride

The first time Greg rode an e-bike, he felt something he hadn’t felt in years—control.

With one push of the throttle, he took off, weaving through traffic like a rebellious digital-age cowboy. No algorithms dictated his route. No invisible hand stopped him from taking the scenic way home just because he felt like it.

For the first time in a decade, he was the one deciding how fast to go.
	•	No speed limits designed by AI committees.
	•	No “optimal routes” that drained the soul out of travel.
	•	No cars blocking bike lanes because their software “miscalculated” human existence.

It was just him, the road, and a fully charged battery.

Chapter 5: The Bureaucratic War on E-Bikes

The moment the government realized people were ditching self-driving cars for e-bikes, the bureaucrats declared war.

They started with fear campaigns:

“E-Bikes Are Dangerous: Experts Warn of 45 MPH Speed Demons on the Loose!”

Then came the regulations:
	•	Helmets were now “mandatory with built-in GPS tracking”.
	•	E-bike owners had to register their bikes like motor vehicles (except, unlike motor vehicles, they got no dedicated lanes).
	•	Insurance was required, even though a full-charge cost about as much as a cup of coffee.

And then, the worst of them all: E-Bike Speed Limits.

“Class 4 e-bikes are now restricted to a maximum of 15 mph,” the transportation secretary announced with a dead-eyed stare. “For your safety.”

“MY SAFETY?” Greg yelled at the TV. “THE ONLY THING THAT NEEDS PROTECTION IS MY RIGHT TO GO FAST!”

It was clear: they were coming for the last open road.

Chapter 6: The Great E-Bike Escape

The crackdown pushed Greg and Vince to the underground e-bike resistance.

They found an old highway, abandoned ever since self-driving cars deemed it “too inefficient.” It was perfect.

Under the cover of night, dozens of e-bikers gathered, headlights shining like beacons of defiance. They rode together, carving through the darkness, pushing past the 15 mph limit like outlaws in a Western movie.

Greg, at the front of the pack, let out a wild laugh. He hadn’t felt this free in years.

The AI-controlled drones that enforced traffic laws couldn’t catch them—they weren’t programmed to deal with rebels.

For the first time in a long time, the road belonged to humans again.

Chapter 7: The Future is Ours

E-bikes didn’t just become an alternative; they became a movement.

People remembered what it felt like to ride, to choose their own path, to break free from an over-optimized world that forgot the importance of the journey.

Governments tried to suppress it, but the movement only grew stronger. City after city built better bike lanes. High-speed e-bike highways emerged. People abandoned autonomous pods in favor of two wheels and a throttle.

Even the self-driving AI, after years of learning from human behavior, started riding e-bikes.

Greg, now a seasoned veteran of the revolution, looked out over a city filled with riders and smiled.

He had his freedom back.

And no machine was ever going to take it again.

Final Thoughts

E-bikes are more than just an alternative form of transport. They’re the last refuge of freedom on the road in an era where automation is taking over.

If you want to live life on your own terms—not dictated by AI speed limits, not optimized into a soulless commute—get on an e-bike.

Because one day, when all the steering wheels are gone, when the last car trip is reduced to a calculated efficiency equation…

The only people still truly riding will be the ones who never gave up the thrill of the open road.

So what’ll it be? Throttle up or give up?

He wanted me to stay with him but I had a serious deadline the next morning, I hadn't made provisions for my pets to be alone overnight, plus we had yet to come to any discussion about any arrangements. I considered this dinner to be a feel for whether or not he was SD material.

I had to stay late at work on Tuesday, so we were messaging throughout the day. He said he was on call to fly back home, so there was uncertainty about whether or not he'd be there on the morning, when he'd need to get some sleep. So, on my way home from work that night, I returned his call and we chatted on my way home. We ended up talking for 2hrs as he didn't want to hang up. I was quite cheeky, and flirtatious, and he was hanging on my every word way past his bedtime lol :) w
I let him know that I was free the whole next day  (yesterday)  and could be more flexible with time.  We talked about going shopping and having dinner again as long as he wasn't called in . 

Yesterday, I started my morning as usual, and decided to text him after a couple of hours to say good morning and see if he had been called in. he didn't immediately respond, so I decided to go about my day with running errands, going to the gym and spa. I didn't hear from him all day. I was enjoying myself, so I wasn't disappointed, and I just figured that he did get called in the middle of the night and I understood. 

He texted me right as I was sitting down for dinner at a nearby restaurant, that he hadn't left yet but had to deal with some emergency paperwork stuff that hadn't been taken care of, and that he was sorry for not communicating and wanted to know if I could have dinner with him. I was nearby so I agreed and we met and had another wonderful dinner and conversation at one of my other favorite restaurants. They practically had to kick us out at the end because we were really enjoying ourselves. 

At that point he knew that he was leaving the next afternoon (today) for sure, so he needed to sleep and had to pack. There happened to be a major serious accident that happened while were eating that would severely impact my drive back home, so I decided to wait it out with him at his place. 

We talked and watched some tv, were tracking coverage of the accident. Then we made out and had some sexy fun without actual sex. He was asking for it, begging for it, but I told him that I don't have sex without having an understanding and and feeling invested in.

I had him completely hot and bothered. After each kiss and would tell me that he wasn't having fun, then I would stop and he ended up begging for one more.

But then things took a turn. He started commenting that he wanted pictures to remember me by, that we should capture my body for him to look back on. I told him no. But he kept mentioning as time went on. So certain points I had my back turned to him briefly, and it's possible that he did take a photo.  It was getting to the time that I decided to start heading home and I went to the bathroom. I could see him from the bathroom and he was on the phone zooming into a picture in a text message thread. I couldn't see it exactly, but it looked like it could be a silhouette of the back of my body.

When I came out of the bathroom I asked him calmly and directly if he had any photos of me. He instantly became defensive and said no. He showed me his phone gallery, but as we know that's the not the same as showing actual text messages. I knew it would be impossible to ask him to go through all of his messages, so as a last measure, I very nicely explained my concern and asked him if he would please reassure me and put my mind to rest and show me his recently deleted photos. I held his hands and looked in his eyes and told him sincerely that I just wanted to be reassured that this something was accidentally taken that it's not there anymore. 

He was so triggered by that. He became very stern and aggressive saying that his ""patience had run out of me"" and that I was ""walking on a fine line with him."" That I had been ""cunning"" and that he ""didn't like the way that I was"". That ""no one has ever gotten away with speaking to him the way that I did over the phone ."" That all I did was ""point out his mistakes and talk about materialistic things and am self centered."" And that ""quite frankly he had had enough.""...

This was a complete revisionist story of what actually happened... All of the sudden I was unlikable and never had been... 

Naturally, I started to gather the rest of my things and put my coat and shoes on. He asked me where I was going.... like am I supposed to stick around after that???

I think he felt bad and wanted to try to soften things a bit. He expressed that wanted to check the roads again before I went, and make me coffee if I needed it. He assured that he was come pick me up if the roads were still closed and he decided to walk me to my car.

When I got in the car he handed me his phone and told me to go through his deleted photos. I did and didn't see anything, so I said ""thanks"" and gave him the phone back.

He responded that ""I called him a liar and didn't even have the decency to apologize and that all I said was 'thanks.' And then told me to ""just go.""

...

I definetly see things that I would like to have done differently, namely not going back to his place with him, and I feel like was too nice/available despite everything I had going on. But I actually enjoyed our chemistry and he was quite generous and pursued me like a gentleman. The attraction was mutual and he had no problem spending money for us. He was already teaching me so much and I genuinely respected him and I told him that. 

I did reach out early this morning because I think I left my key fob in his hotel room and wanted to retrieve it from the front desk, but he ignored my call/left me on read.
I won't be contacting him any further.

Just wanted to know how this experience comes across to everyone else. With the way things went, I don't feel it's my place to pursue patching things up, so I'll be letting this be.

Because we are in the same social circle I'm worried about the repercussions of this, but I'm deciding to lay low for a while. Plus it helps the he'll be out of the county for some time. ",2,1738260884.0,sugarlifestyleforum,29,0.75,False
1idtf4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/1idtf4z/ulpt_business_travel/,ULPT: Business Travel,"Ok, so sometimes you need to travel for work. Depending on your company, you can either use a company credit card or your personal credit card and submit receipts.

These are a few tips I had over 10 years of traveling for work. Both with a company card and using a personal card.

Airlines: Your email receipt doesn't say if it's a first class seat or a coach seat. Or, you booked 2 coach seats. Usually just the flight info and the price. I've booked 1st class or 2 seats in coach. All depends on the price. $250 coach seat? Book 2. One company had a max of $500 before needing approval. At the time, 1st class was $499 to a regular destination. Every time. 

Hotel: Receipt doesn't show type of room or rate code. I used to ALWAYS book 2x point rooms. 

Food: These aren't big value but hey, it's free. Every time I get takeout, I'd always get 2 drinks. Bottle beverage and a water. Or coffee and water or coffee and a bottle beverage. I always end up taking the 2nd home (obviously not flight trips).",4,1738260883.0,UnethicalLifeProTips,0,0.83,False

So a few months ago my friend gave me a watermelon red bull. I waited a good few weeks to drink it. and yknow it was good but nothing special. Anyways fast forward to 3 weeks ago i’m CRAVING that fucking watermelon Red bull….. i wish i never bought that shit. This watermelon red bull now has a choke hold on my life. I fear it’s gripping at my soul. I’ve been drinking monsters casually like MAYBEEE 2 a month. I also casually drink coffee maybe 2 a week. nothing too serious. but jesus christ what the hell are the putting in red bull. probably coke let’s be honest. i’ve been drinking two a day and I know it’s not healthy. but the way it makes my tongue feel it’s all sparkely and tingly. IVE never had an addiction this fucking bad. i’m not getting headaches (yet) but thinking about the way red bull slides down my throat and the way the crisp matte finish feels against my finger tips… it’s enough to make me feel anxious. I’m sitting here in my college class counting down the minutes and the seconds till i can leave and go buy a beautiful crispy new red bull.

But am i going to die from this.",17,1738260856.0,redbull,16,0.95,False

The first couple days I noticed a difference but then the only difference I noticed was waking up every night in the middle of the night with this thudding sensation in my chest. Every night. During the day I noticed no difference at all except that I couldn’t drink a coffee without getting really jittery and uncomfortable. 

No side effects aside from the thudding at night and no side effects whatsoever today after going cold turkey. 

I dunno, this was pretty disappointing. Aside from the likely higher blood pressure, this eventually felt like a sugar pill. ",2,1738260705.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,2,1.0,False
