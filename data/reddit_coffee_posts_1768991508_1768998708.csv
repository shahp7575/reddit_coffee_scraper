City use (maximum).
Bangalore roads.
Bangalore traffic.
Recreational vehicle.
No pillion.
_Further context below;_

75 kg body weight.
36M
5'9"" height

PICK ONE.

I used to ride Pulsar 180, rode it for ≈13 years, before selling it off, 4 years ago.
Currently, I'm eyeing ditching 2 out of the 4 wheels in my car and getting a bike again for solo city usage and recreational riding.

Primary use case would be within the city, but once every three months, if the opportunity presents itself, I'd like to venture out on a bewildering highway exploration ride, in and around Bangalore.
No goals, no destination, ride solo, enjoy the scenic views, stop for food, and return.

I'm going to run a bike choice poll, once in two to three days, of different categories of bikes. I'm not hellbent on a specific kind of motorcycle, as long as it makes me feel happy.
Personally, from experience, I have always preferred a slightly aggressive stance, like a roadster, but I realize I'm getting old for it (not really), but I think I can explore / learn to enjoy the experiences of other form factors as well.

Additional context is that, my job is WFH, so my daily commutes within the city are not work related journeys. It's just running basic errands or going across the city to grab a cup of coffee and unwind. Or simply unwinding through the busyness and noises of the streets. (Sometimes I get lonely alone at home working all day, okay, don't judge.)
And the misses, well she don't do bikes. The car will be there for when we need to travel as a unit.

Looking for genuine female friends to hang out with in Bangalore, someone to chill with after office, share coffee, conversations, laughs, rants, happiness, and hard days too. I’m the kind of friend who listens without judging and is there 24/7 when you need someone.

But I want to be honest, I’ve faced too many fake friendships. I’ve met people online (even from Reddit), some ghosted, some stayed for a while and then disappeared. It hurts more than people realize.

So please, if you know you’re going to vanish someday, don’t text. I’m looking for long-term, real friendship, not temporary conversations or weird DMs.

If I care about you as a friend, I care deeply, and I promise you’ll never feel uncomfortable with me. I just don’t have the strength anymore for fake connections.

I am Naomi, 25 years old and from the South of the Netherlands. 

I'm looking for a QPR (Queer Platonic Relationship) with someone who's also on the ace spectrum. Ideally, you are based in the Netherlands/Flanders/Western Germany. I'm not really made for long-distance relationships, tbh - I’d love something where we can actually meet up, spend time together and do fun things. I enjoy cuddles, hand-holding and forehead kisses, but nothing beyond that! 

Fun things can be anything - going to the beach, shopping, seeing a movie or a musical, having dinner, visiting museums... the possibilities are endless! 

My hobbies are reading, writing, baking, cooking, travelling, visiting themeparks, watching series/movies, playing board games and spending time with friends and family.

I also love themeparks, Disney (anything even remotely related to it), Harry Potter (I don't agree with JK), sunsets, coffee and history (especially WW2). I'm definitely a bit of a nerd - in a good way. Think Felicity/Barry energy (ten points if you got that). I tend to throw in random facts and ramble when I'm nervous. 

I would describe myself as spontaneous, enthusiastic, stubborn, loyal and kind. 

Oh and besides Dutch and English, I speak German too!

We can exchange photos after we've been talking for a bit!

To the modern professional, standard career advice (""Go build your network"") feels like instruction on how to be fake. It treats human relationships like a sales funnel.

From a systems perspective, this is inefficient. It relies on social friction rather than verified output.

The Pivot: Relationship vs. Verification

We are witnessing a fundamental shift in the market logic:

• The Old Way (Relationship Economy): Success depends on ""Who you know."" You chase people, buy coffees, and hope they like you enough to open a door. This is Lag.

• The New Way (Verification Economy): Success depends on ""What you can prove."" 

You broadcast competence, publish insights, and let the opportunities find you. This is Signal.

The Protocol

Stop trying to be ""liked"" by strangers on LinkedIn.

Start being ""useful"" to your industry.

If you are sending ""I'd love to connect"" DMs, you are fighting a ghost.

They *show* it. And most of us miss it because we’re busy overanalyzing texts, stalking his IG, or waiting for a grand romantic speech that only happens in movies. In real life? Interest is usually more subtle. But our brains and bodies give us away, even when we try to hide it.

This post is a deep dive into clear (but non-obvious) signs a male is romantically or emotionally interested in you. Not based on zodiac memes or TikTok “situationship” threads — this is filtered from behavioral science, expert interviews, and trusted psychology sources. Because too many people get misled by eye contact “hacks” and viral dating takes from influencers who are just optimizing for clicks.

This isn’t about blaming yourself for not knowing. These signals can be learned. They’re patterns, not mysteries.

Here’s what to actually look for, decoded.

* **He mirrors your body language WITHOUT knowing it***One of the most studied indicators of attraction is unconscious mimicry.* According to a Princeton study published in *Psychological Science*, people tend to copy the posture, gestures, or speech rhythm of someone they feel drawn to. So if he touches his neck after you do, shifts his body when you shift, or starts matching your energy — yes, that’s a thing.
   * Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy explains on the *Hidden Brain* podcast that mirroring happens when someone wants to connect — it’s driven by the brain's mirror neurons, not intention. And the weirder part? We do it without noticing.

* **He finds reasons to be near you — not just talk***Proximity is physical interest.* Dr. Albert Mehrabian, known for his nonverbal communication research, found that people tend to reduce personal space with those they favor. So if he chooses the seat close to you even when others are open, leans in when you speak, or lingers instead of leaving — he’s feeling something.*In the book The Like Switch by former FBI agent Jack Schafer*, proximity is listed as a key unconscious “friendship-forming” move. It’s not about making a move. It’s about wanting to be in your space.

* **He subtly competes for your attention when others are around***Social context changes everything.* Evolutionary psychologists like David Buss talk about “mate signaling behavior” — subtle status displays or humor when a potential competitor enters the room. It’s not always about dominance. Sometimes he just becomes louder, funnier, or more helpful when you’re talking to someone else.
   * Pay attention to how he acts when you're focused on others — if there's a shift, that's usually not random.

* **He remembers the tiniest, most irrelevant details***Active recall is rare unless we care.* Dr. Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist and leading expert on romantic love, explains that romantic attachment activates the brain’s reward system — especially areas tied to focus and memory. That’s why someone who’s into you may remember tiny things you said about your dog, your favorite coffee order, or that weird dream you told him once.\*If he brings up something from a random convo you barely remember, his brain filed it under “important” — which doesn’t happen with people we’re indifferent to.

* **He shares personal stuff even if it feels random***Emotional disclosure is a trust signal.* Gottman Institute studies show that people who feel safe and emotionally invested start revealing more about themselves — their past, their fears, their opinions. A guy who’s into you might not say “I like you” but might randomly open up about his childhood or tell you what drives him.\*The book *Attached* by Amir Levine notes that this type of openness is tied to secure attachment or high interest — especially early on.

* **He finds low-stakes ways to help you or “show up”***Helpful behavior is one of the clearest low-key signs.* A study from the *Journal of Social and Personal Relationships* found that small, consistent support behaviors (like offering to carry something, sending you a useful link, or helping you troubleshoot work stress) are more predictive of actual romantic intent than big gestures.\*This is especially true for men who aren’t verbal about feelings — action is the language.

* **He teases or playfully challenges you — but watches your reaction***Flirty banter is risky — and only done with people we’re drawn to.* According to Dr. Monica Moore, who researches courtship behavior, playful teasing mixed with eye attentiveness is a common male flirting strategy. It helps test boundaries while building rapport. But here’s the key: *if he notices your reaction closely*, it shows he actually cares how you feel.
   * A guy who truly isn't interested won't track if a joke landed or made you uncomfortable. He just moves on.

Stop letting mixed signals confuse you. A lot of signals are readable once you stop thinking they need to be verbal. Trust consistent patterns over big confessions. People are rarely obvious — but they’re always expressing something. Especially with their body, focus, and time.

If he’s showing *multiple* of the above behaviors often and with you only? It’s not in your head. That’s interest.",1,1768997149.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1qiw2h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDeals/comments/1qiw2h6/want_to_know_final_end_of_all_knowledge/,want to know final end of all knowledge ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

My friend has brought up this one thing about me and i just dont know how to feel about it. I've been a tomboy since 1st grade and had my first boyfriend in 2nd/3rd grade. I dated my best friend (F) for 2 years till we got into 5th grade and couldn't hangout anymore.

I told myself ""im just bi..."" and ""I wish I'd been born a boy..."" and always thought there was nothing wrong with any of this until I started getting bullied by best friend. He was SURELY homophobic because why else would u tease somebody by calling them gay (even though im AFAB so it would be lesbian..?) like theres something wrong with it?! Skip to 5th grade, im thinking about being trans and immediately kick it out of my head.

Then I saw this anime that had this really cute gay guy in it and I'm like ""wellllllll being lgbtq ain't thaaaaat bad riiiiiight????"" (Im so fr thats what made me think that.) OK, now 6th Grade im like... ""I like men, I like women, I kinda like my NB friend, wth is wrong with me?! Oh yea, and I'm a tomboy who feels no connection to femininity! WHAT DOES THIS MEEEEAAAAAN?!?!?!?!?!?!?""

Long story short I went from girl to tomboy to non-binary to agender(?) to genderfluid to fluidflux to non-binary to demiboy to AGAB-less to transmasculine to coffee bean transmasculine to FTM. And thats just my gender...

Also I went from straight to bi to straight to bi to idek to omnisexual to gay to omni-gay.

Needless to say I'm a very complicated person and that kinda messes up my thoughts because I say I'm gay but I kinda have a teeny tiny crush on my friend and she just sees me as a friend (not gotta get that deep into my love life here). Anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest and uhhh... have a nice day!

Otherwise, im in my office most of the day on my phone. I'm down to share photos, too, if curious what I look like.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too. Im love chatting about plants and fish. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

1qivzii,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1qivzii/quitting_smoking_after_a_scare/,Quitting smoking after a scare,"Greetings everyone, as the title says, I (22 M) am planning to stop smoking after a recent scare. I woke up in the morning, around 3 days ago, I went to wash my face and as always I cleared my throat and spat in the sink. I noticed some blood in the phlegm against the sink's white font, and that my trachea felt irritated as I was feeling that annoying sharp pain, that I suppose many smokers are familiar with, when taking deep breaths. 

I was a bit scared, but I forgot it immediately after, made me some warm coffee to warm my trachea, and lit a cigarette. Next time there was a phlegm, it had more blood in it, which made me even more worried, and led to the decision to stop smoking. I decided to smoke what's left in the pack until the nightfall and never get a pack again. 

It's been 2 days and the situation is unbearable. I've been a smoker for around 4 years now, since the second year of university, when things got difficult, and every time I've tried quitting I've failed miserably. These past 2 days that I've stopped smoking, I stopped seeing blood and the irritation has retreated as it seems, but the cravings are rather strong. I'm also going through a pretty stressful period, during which the cigarettes provided some kind of comfort, and now I don't even have that, which is rather unfortunate. I am not sure to what extent I'd trade my health for temporary comfort, and that's the only thing that's keeping me from relapsing, but I'm not sure to what extent it'll work in the long run either.

Every idea or tip would be extremely appreciate it, I'd mainly like to replace the habit with something that resembles it without the unhealthy part. I've tried nic pouches, gums, patches etc in the past and they haven't worked because they lack the ritualistic style of smoking cigarettes and I have no idea what to do with my hands. I would also like to know if you think that buying a smoking pipe would be a good alternative to restrict the habit and make it an occasional ritual for special cases, as I've been considering it for quite a while.

1qivx9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1qivx9x/why_having_a_morning_routine_is_the_single/,Why having a morning routine is the single greatest discipline hack I've ever discovered,"I used to wake up and immediately check my phone. Then I'd scroll. Then I'd feel behind. Then I'd rush through everything. By 9 AM, I was already exhausted and reactive.

Now I wake up and do the same things in the same order every single day. No thinking. No deciding. Just executing.

The difference is night and day.

WHY MORNING ROUTINES WORK

1. Decision fatigue is real.

Every decision you make depletes your willpower. By eliminating morning decisions (What should I eat? Should I work out? What should I do first?), you preserve that energy for things that actually matter.

2. You ""win"" before the day starts.

When you complete your morning routine, you've already accomplished something. That psychological momentum carries forward. You're not playing catch-up—you're building on success.

3. You train discipline like a muscle.

Every morning you complete your routine—especially when you don't feel like it—you strengthen your discipline muscle. After a few months, discipline becomes your default, not your exception.

MY ACTUAL ROUTINE (nothing fancy)

5:45  Wake up (same time every day, weekends included) 5:50  Water + bathroom 6:00  20 minutes of movement (stretching, walk, or workout depending on the day) 6:20  Cold water on face, get dressed 6:30 Coffee + 15 minutes of reading 6:45  Review my three priorities for the day 7:00  Start deep work on most important task

Total: 75 minutes before I touch my phone or open email.

HOW TO BUILD YOUR OWN

Start embarrassingly small.

Don't try to become a 5 AM CrossFit meditation monk overnight. Start with one thing. For me, it was just: wake up, drink water, don't touch phone for 30 minutes.

Once that felt automatic (about 2 weeks), I added the next element.

Make it frictionless.

Lay out your workout clothes the night before. Prep your coffee. Remove every possible obstacle between you and completing the routine.

Same time, every day.

Consistency beats intensity. Waking up at 6 AM every day is better than 5 AM sometimes and 9 AM other times. Your body will adapt.

No negotiation.

The routine happens. Period. You don't ask yourself if you feel like it. You don't debate whether to skip today. It's not a choice it's just what you do.

THE RESULT

Six months in, my morning routine is automatic. I don't think about it. I don't resist it. It just happens.

And everything else in my life got easier. Because I start every single day with proof that I can do hard things.",2,1768996478.0,Discipline,0,1.0,False

I am really confused and I am in the middle of my postgraduate exams so please bear with me as I navigate through this. It's really long and confusing but please try to stay to give me your opinion.

Background: I (28F) married my husband, Peter (29M) almost two years ago. We belong to a culture where arranged marriages are the norm, so we met through parental channels about 2.5 years ago. While we were in the ""courting"" phase, Peter was always agreeing with me on everything, I was very clear that I like things my way, and Peter agreed to do everything my way, he'd declare his feelings constantly, acting like he was in love with me and whatnot, and as silly as it may seem, I fell for it. He said he didn't have a choice in marrying me because he fell for me when we first met, whereas I have always maintained that I chose to marry him and choose to constantly love him. His parents, during this phase, continued talking to my parents and everything seemed fine. Peter has an older sister, Kat (32F), who is married and has two children (8F and 3M) but lives very close to Peter's parents' house, 5 minutes walking distance. Now, the issue is that from we could tell (and from what Peter's parents constantly said), Kat had no involvement in Peter's parents' household (in my culture, joint family system is the norm so Peter and I would live with his parents after our wedding) and her children came to visit the grandparents every now and then. Whenever we went to visit Peter's parents, the children were never there, be it a weekday, weekend, afternoon, evening, you name it. So this got embedded into our minds that there is no involvement. One particular statement from Peter's mother stayed with me, ""I keep calling Kat to come and have a cup of coffee with me but she keeps saying she doesn't have the time!"".

Now, after I got married, I realized his parents are extremely intrusive. Some instances:

1. his parents Face-timed us at inappropriate times on our honeymoon, leading to arguments between us.
2. His sister and BIL would call at any time to confirm something or seek his help regarding some matter or the other.
3. After the honeymoon, his mother came into our room a couple of times without knocking, although Peter did reprimand her for that.
4. Also, 8F was almost ALWAYS there, also entering our room whenever, even knocking relentlessly if the door was locked and we didn't open the door.
5. She would also take away snacks or other items from my room without my permission and then MIL would lie and say that she ate it or took it. I still remember I found one snack on her 4 months after my marriage, that I thought I'd thrown away by mistake. When I asked MIL about it, she casually said, ""she took it when you guys were on your honeymoon, I thought you won't eat it so I let her have it"".

I come from a relatively quiet house where privacy is entertained, if not respected, so this started becoming very disturbing for me. Now, at this point, around one month after our wedding, my in-laws tell me that Kat's husband is unemployed (they'd said he has a well-established business) as he lost everything due to some circumstances and now is depressed and so, they call him to stay in their house every day from morning 8 AM till Kat is not home, around 5 PM. But that was not all, Kat's children stayed here all day, 8F went to school and came back to this house, then slept here, although 3M went with his parents and only stayed till his parents did (which was often till 7-8 pm). All of Kat's family's meals, including 8F's breakfast was cooked by my MIL, every day, and when they forgot to take dinner home, they'd command (yes, command, not request, not ask) Peter to take it. No one on his side saw any issues with this system, even if he was disturbed in the middle of working (when he worked at home) or studying (his field requires continuous studying) to go buy a packed of crisps for his niece. I started objecting, MIL noticed, and stopped asking Peter, although Peter kept insisting he wants to do this all, completely opposite of what he said on our honeymoon (""please say no to my family from my side so I can focus on work and studying"").

Peter's parents also told me stories of Kat's in-laws ill-treating her severely (even till assault) and telling me that that is the reason she doesn't live with them in their city. This was also weird for me, considering whenever I spoke with Kat before our wedding, she'd say her MIL was a little two-faced, but her SIL and FIL were lovely people. I never asked about her in-laws, she'd offer stories herself and always along the same tune.

Till now, however, everything was relatively fine. Peter was nice to me, almost 90% of what he'd been before marriage, so I was still okay with everything else. The turning point came when Kat's in-laws came to live with their son and DIL for a couple of days. There were daily fights between them, Kat moved here with her children, and one day finally, it reached a breaking point when Peter got enraged at what his BIL had been doing and started acting really aggressively and violent. His mother, sister, and her daughter were bawling, and his mother ended up slapping him, I took his hand and tried to take him out of the house, but he started resisting, almost getting rude with him when his father warned him and he just came with me. I won't get into the details of this encounter but ever since this happened, I started resenting everything and everyone on Peter's side of the family. I slowly started finding flaws in things that I ignored earlier. Where I felt sorry for Kat earlier, I was now angry at her parents for hiding everything from us before finalising the marriage. Where I was just a little uncomfortable with 8F and her father spending all day here, now it started getting on my nerves.

When I spoke to Peter about these issues, that's when our relationship started cracking. He became insanely possessive and protective of his family members, particularly his sister, wouldn't let me say a word without insulting me, my intelligence, and completely denying that his parents lied about anything or hid anything. 4 months in, I got pregnant and due to the possibility of some future health issues, I decided to continue with the pregnancy, despite Peter saying he was not ready. My fault, to some extent, but I tried telling him about my health issues and how it might become very difficult for me to become pregnant again but he was still reluctant at best. However, his anger kept bubbling up and almost once every month, he'd scream and shout at me, even threatening to hit me, and much worse, all because I'd bring up an issue regarding his family. I had to go to the ER once because my BP went above 145 and my fetus was at risk. But he didn't change. In fact, 2 days after my delivery (one year after my marriage), he read my journal in which I'd written that I don't ever want his parents to meet my child, and he started an explosive argument while I was still struggling to pee on my own. He even refused to let the nurses put my baby next to me while sleeping.

Let's come to his side now. I can't really tell you his side as well of course, and maybe I'll miss many things, but I am doing the best I can under the extremely stressful situation I am in. My mother has a habit of saying what she thinks is right, not unfiltered, but she will say it, even if it's hurtful. Completely her shortcoming, won't defend it. So, my mother, upon hearing and seeing how unhappy I was becoming, started asking Peter why his parents do so much for his sister and why don't they now focus on the two of you. Peter helped my father with an issue for 5 months and during these 5 months, he had to inevitably come into close contact with my mother and she would say something or the other to him. For instance, she'd comment on how dull everyone keeps saying I look post-marriage, when women tend to actually glow during this time. Then came my pregnancy, which made her even more protective of me. I was losing weight, rushing to the ER, my reports were not coming back very good, so she kept blaming Peter more and more. The post-delivery incident just made everything much worse. My mother and Peter have not spoken in over a year.

Peter has it in his head that I do everything that my mother tells me to, and she wants me to separate him from his parents because that's what my father did for my mother when my grandmother refused to let her come back from her parental home once. He thinks everyone in my family follows my mother's orders and she wants to control him and have his sister and his parents be away from him and me. In every argument, he brings her up, even if it's my refusal to have sex. He says my mother must have advised me to not have sex with him. To his credit, he has improved a lot over the last year, but it's still pretty bad.

Current Issue: Our latest argument is regarding our son. I am in the middle of giving my postgraduate exams and I came to my parental house as I couldn't study at his place because MIL looks after Kat's kids so who would look after my baby? My son has a minor medical condition that is shared by my nephew, unfortunately. My nephew is 4 months older than my son and my brother and SIL have decided to follow through with their doctor's advise and get a very minor surgery to get rid of that condition for life. I went to my pediatrician with my husband, who said that his condition won't affect his life majorly (the intensity is different), but it's still better to get the surgery done as it WILL cause some issues later on, even if minor. When we spoke about this at home, we decided to get a couple more medical opinions just to be sure. So, now that I am here, I decided to get an opinion from nephew's surgeon. When I suggested this to Peter, he went ballistic and said that he knows my mother wants to get it for our son simply because my nephew got it done?? And I told him to think about what he's saying logically. Why would I spend thousands on a surgery (when we are suffering financially as I can't work currently due to baby and Master's and husband's work doesn't pay as well) my son (8 month-old) doesn't need, simply because my mother said so? I am a well-educated woman, currently pursuing my second Master's, and all my education has been from well-renowned institutions, something my husband envies (he has admitted this himself) as no one his family has this kind of education. So, why does he assume I will do something this stupid? Anyway, he said that we will get him checked only when he wants to and that if I went to the surgeon here, ""it won't be good"". I told him to fuck off and said he shouldn't do this in matters related to our baby.

He proceeded to ghost me and then when I texted him on the day of the appointment (confirmed with him when I booked it, before he threatened me), he again ignored me and called my father to say that if I went, his family will cut off all relations with my son, which frankly made me a little happy, but the tone in which is spoke to my father was horrendous. He doesn't have the guts to raise his voice to his parents, who've constantly put him down, saying awful things about him, but he speaks to my father in a tone which I could hear standing 7 feet away from him over call (not on speaker). Now, his family has done nothing for my son anyway, 90% of what my son owns, from diapers to clothes to toys and other things like cot, my mother bought for him. The remaining 10% includes stuff by his family, my brother and SIL, and SIL's family, so you can imagine how much his family has done for my son. I am outraged that he spoke to my father while ghosting me, and then I went and ruined my papers (he did the same thing during my last sem's papers) and I think I might even ruin the upcoming ones (3 remaining). So, I don't know if I am wrong in thinking it's his fault? My mother also said that I should just wait if Peter wants to and that I shouldn't rush into it. But we could have had this conversation like two sane, rational adults, IMO. Instead, I am shaking, unable to study, with 3 exams in the next 3 days, while he is posting stories on Insta about how unstable feminists are.

Of course, if he told his side of the story everything would sound different. So, how do I go about navigating this mess? How to make him realise my mother is not a puppet master and I have my own thoughts?

Tldr: My husband thinks my mother controls me and all my decisions because of comments she made in the past.

Ps. I mentioned the huge background so that anyone who reads can understand why he is the way he is. Please don't suggest divorce as that is not possible for me; if it were, I wouldn't still be suffering like this. And I am well-aware that he is not just a red flag, he's the whole red country. I would appreciate any constructive advice that might help this situation other than these two statements.",3,1768995934.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False
1qivqvt,https://v.redd.it/4qcbae62xoeg1,Leaking water from “connector piece”,"Anyone know how I can repair this? Fortunately, the coffee brewing is fine, but obviously it loses tons of water and the drip tray fills up very quickly. 

I replaced some springs in the group and replaced a few parts, thinking maybe it would help something that’s perhaps stuck, and therefore redirecting the water to this piece in large amounts .  So far, no luck. The only thing I didn’t replace is one of these copper parts in the group, that has this stem that comes out of one side… I believe the original rocket part as a triangular copper piece, and the replacement I have has a rectangular copper piece… I wasn’t sure if this is one-to-one replaceable, or if I need a triangular piece like the original.

Any idea what the problem is? 

Not sure if it has any relation, but also on start up, there’s a crazy whistling sound, that I could seem to reduce when I open up the steam wand, and then when I close it, it whistles again. It’s only about a couple minutes when the machine is starting up, and we don’t make any milk drinks, but maybe it’s relevant.

1qivprh,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1qivprh/my_friend_keeps_bringing_up_the_beginning_of_my/,My friend keeps bringing up the beginning of my relationship and it makes me feel guilty,"I feel bad about how my relationship with my boyfriend started. He first messaged me, and the next day we met in person. We lived in the same building. Our first meeting was really fun and I was genuinely excited. I was 20 at the time and had never even kissed anyone or had anything with anyone before, so I had no experience at all.

After that, we saw each other once more that week, and I remember texting my friends that it was fun again. I didn’t think too much about it and then I went home for two weeks (I lived in my university city). During that time, I started texting a guy from my university, and it felt exciting over messages. In those two weeks, I actually liked the guy I was texting more than my current boyfriend. I was texting both of them.

When I returned to my university city, my current boyfriend came over briefly, and I remember thinking that maybe I did like him, but I was supposed to go for coffee with the online guy the next day. The coffee with the online guy didn’t go well at all — the moment I saw him walking toward me in real life, I knew I didn’t like him, and I noticed he was short. He was the same height as me, and I didn’t find that attractive. After I got back to my apartment, I immediately called my current boyfriend and we hung out. That same day, I ended things with the online guy. And then the next day, when I saw my current boyfriend again, I knew for sure that I was in love.

What bothers me is that my friend, even now a few years later and throughout my relationship, often brings it up and says something like: “Ah, I remember when you were unsure whether you wanted to be with him or not.” I don’t understand why she keeps mentioning it. It makes me feel really bad, and I feel guilty for having gone for that coffee with the other guy

Item 1 of 2
Hi Reddit!

I'm just looking for advice on what to put in this little area that goes from my kitchen to my living room. (Sorry for the clutter. I've been hectcially re-arranging, lol.)

I have a smaller, 700' apartment. I'm always looking for something to maximize functionality. Like more table space, or storage. I was also considering some kind of set up with a mini-fridge. Coffee stand?

I previously had an fishtank stand here, but didn't like the way it flowed into the living room . maybe a divider of sorts to help make the spaces more clearly defined?

...

I was thinking of getting the IKEA Resaro table and having it stick longways from the wall, so I could use both sides of the extendable table. That way it makes a little divider, gives table space.

What do you think?",1,1768995458.0,DesignMyRoom,3,1.0,False
1qivlg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/vbac/comments/1qivlg2/mourning_an_unsuccessful_vbac/,Mourning an unsuccessful vbac,"I’m 9 months pp after an unsuccessful VBAC attempt .

I was desperate for a VBAC, I had a cat 2 section with my first after 12 hours on a Pitocin drip , failure to progress and fetal distress.

With my VBAC I drank all the raspberry leaf tea, I expressed colostrum . I tried . I had prodromal labour for a week but at 41 weeks the O and G team recommended a Foley catheter induction . 

It was all going fine , the catheter was put in at 6pm and the told me they would check me the next morning at 6am . The insertion was a breeze , not painful . Mu husband and I went to go and get a coffee .

I reminder asking to go back to the bed after an hour because I was finding the contractions that it has caused so painful. 

I went back to the bed and lay there listening to music breathing through the contractions . Im no wimp- during my first induction I had 4 in 10 contractions without pain relief for 6 hours before I got an epidural . Even the O and G doctors during their rounds were shocked at how I was tolerating it . 

However , with these contractions I just couldn’t cope , the pain was relentless and I could barely speak to my husband . I asked for some pain relief and the midwives said I could have some after a CTG. They put the monitor on and then said they would come check it in a bit . I was a bit confused because in all my antenatal appointments they said that I would constant monitoring was a VBAC and in the last hospital I gave birth in they were monitoring my CTG remotely from a staff room but evidently no one was paying much attention here. 

At 11pm it was time for my husband to leave as per hospital policy but he just wouldn’t leave , he had his backpack on to go but he seemed distressed. I asked him wha was wrong , he kept saying he don’t want to leave me in so much pain and didn’t think the monitor was right . He kept repeating that baby’s heart rate seemed low . I kept telling him to just leave it …( I couldn’t think , I just wanted to roll around in pain . I had still been given no pan relief at this point …. I also I thought what could he know? He’s an accountant for Christ sake ). He ignored me and grabbed a midwife and made them look at the CTG.

The midwives face dropped , she told my husband to pull the red alarm. 

20 mins later my bay was born via cat 1 section. She had been having prolonged decelerations with no recovery and they couldn’t find a heartbeat as they were ramming the spinal into my back on the OR table .

When she was born i was in heaven. We had skin to skin immediately and it she latched and fed in the OR as I was being sewn up. 

I don’t think I’m necessarily upset I had a section I’m just so sad I had the option of a VBAC so quickly whipped away, I think all the time … what if I had just waited for spontaneous labour at home? What if I made them check me after pulling the baloon out prior to the section? Was i dilated ? Could i have just repositioned ? I know the answer is no … and she’s ALIVE . We could have had a very different outcome . But the unfair / guilty feelings just won’t leave .

Both my best friends are also currently just about to have their first baby. They are both planning on vagina births and so confident about them , they say things like “ all I need to do is eat some dates ? Didn’t you eat the before you births “ , “ c-sec is a last resort for me “. It feels so invalidating . I am sic to death with social media touting that “ natural birth is best “ , that a c section is lesser and that if I had just done a bit more curb walking by my baby would have taken a different exit . I just want to slap the with a silly stick . I don’t even want to see them at the moment because I find the topic so triggering but at the same time I can’t stop thinking about it .

In my head I think all the time , why don’t I have a this and go for a vbac again? All I see on Reddit is posters talking

About how they only got over their c-section  with a “ redemptive “ successful vbac. But I’m not sure I even want a third … raising 2 kids is hard !

I find it so difficult to manage these emotions and i do speak to my husband about it but understandably he doesn’t really get it . I think it’s a primal urge to want to birth vaginally regardless of not if it ends in poor outcomes and for some reason my stupid brain wants it and won’t let it go! 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get over these feelings ? ",4,1768995409.0,vbac,2,1.0,False

He walked straight to the small lock-box bolted under his desk, heart beating harder than it should have.

Damn it’s not even been a week since she left this blasted thing here.

He opened the box. The matte-black chit sat exactly where he’d placed it—unassuming, heavy with implication.

Hale inserted it into his terminal.

A single file popped up.

Header: Titus Staples

Subject: QEC Communication

He typed quickly:

Titus is fine. Will be in my office awaiting your instructions. – Hale

He hit send.

Then he waited.

The reply came almost instantly.

Acknowledged. En route. Maintain discretion. – Winfield

Hale exhaled, pulled the chit, locked the box, and sat back.

Whatever came next, he knew one thing for certain: the boy wasn’t just a fast-tracked cadet anymore.

He never had been.

And the Principality’s oldest, most dangerous promise had just woken up.

Edward and Titus walked through the station in silence, boots echoing softly on the deck plates until they reached Hale’s door. Hale was already inside, sweating even though the room was cool.

He locked the door behind them.

Edward looked at Titus. “Young man, who is your mom?”

Titus started to answer—“Shh”—but before he could finish, the outer lock hissed open.

Hale spun toward the door, eyes wide.

Lady Carol stepped inside, calm and regal.

“I’m sorry,” she said, “but… how did you get in?”

She looked at Hale. “Director, thank you for reaching out as required. All is well.”

Hale stammered. “What—but—”

Lady Carol raised a hand, silencing him. “I’m sorry this happened this way. But I need to speak with young Staples alone, please.”

Hale pointed to his inner office. “And Director, will you both have a seat, please.”

Hale swallowed. “Yes, my Lady.”

Edward and Hale exchanged a WTF glance, then sat.

Lady Carol motioned to Titus. “This way, please.”

They entered the office. The door slid shut behind them with a soft hiss.

Inside, Lady Carol turned to Titus, voice gentle but firm.

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Back in the mess hall 

For a long moment, the table was silent.

Cathy exhaled slowly, staring at the empty doorway. “They’re not telling us everything.”

Kelly nodded, fingers tightening around her water bottle. “No. They’re not.”

Cathy leaned back, arms crossed. “I say we stay put. Whatever’s going on, it’s big enough that Edward just lied to our faces—and Hale’s involved. If it was something we needed to know right this second, they’d have said it.”

Kelly’s jaw worked for a second. “I don’t like being left in the dark.”

“Neither do I,” Cathy said quietly. “But Edward’s been watching Titus since day one. Hale’s got the keys to half the station. If anyone can handle this—whatever ‘this’ is—it’s them. Pushing now might just make them clam up harder.”

Kelly stared at her empty tray, then looked up. “You’re right. We wait. Let them deal with it. But the second Titus walks back through that door…”

Cathy’s smile was small, fierce. “You’ll get your answers. And I’ll be right there with you.”

They sat in companionable silence for a few minutes, the hum of the station filling the space between them.

Then both their data pads pinged.

Kelly pulled hers out first. The message was from Joana:

Come to Logistics. Now. – J

Cathy read hers at the same time. “Same thing.”

Kelly stood, pushing her chair back. “Guess the waiting’s over.”

Cathy rose beside her. “Let’s go see what fresh hell this is.”

They walked out together—shoulder to shoulder, two women who’d grown up in the steel corridors of Astoria Prime, who’d learned early that secrets were currency and trust was rare.

Whatever was happening, they’d face it the way they always had.

Together.

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Hale’s office 

“A missed communication is the reason for this unfortunate situation.”

Titus blinked. “How does my mother have a QEC?”

The noble looked at him, eyes softening. “My Lo—” She caught herself. “Your mother is a wonderful friend to House Winfield. We owe her a debt which we may never repay.”

She stepped closer. “Please, Titus, embrace this unfortunate situation. Yes, there is a QEC—both here and on Phorantis. This must be kept secret.”

She paused, voice lowering. “Young man, as long as Vickie lives, there will be a QEC near. It is a debt we owe her for her lifetime commitment to House Winfield.”

“Embrace this, Titus Staples it is a request from Vickey .”

Titus stared. “Lady Car—”

Her hand gently touched his lips. “There is no need to worry. We are here for you and your mother.”

“Please, when you message your mother, be discreet.”

“Now, young Staples—how do you want us to deal with this unpleasant situation?”

Titus swallowed. “Uh… what are you saying?”

“These people now know you are not a normal commoner.”

Titus shook his head slowly. “Do nothing.”

“There were four people at the table. Who are the other two?”

“Friends.”

“One I enjoy spending time with.”

Lady Carol’s eyes softened further. “Would this be Kelly Raven?”

Titus smiled faintly. “Yes, it is.”

Lady Carol saw the sparkle in his eyes, the small smile when he said her name.

Again she touched his lips gently. “There is no need for titles for the son of Vickey Staples to us.”

She reached into an unseen pocket, opened her hand, and revealed a small glass vial containing just a few strands of blue hair.

Titus’s smile grew. “I understand, Carol.”

Lady Carol’s voice was soft, almost reverent. “Titus… your mother has done a great act for the Principality. We will never forget the sacrifices she has made.”

“I believe we are done here. Titus, thrive on the life you are building.”

“I must leave now. Remember—no messages to your mother about a QEC or this conversation .”

The door opened.

Lady Carol walked over to Director Hale. “Director, this is for you.” She handed him a chit. “I thank you for the way you handled this today.”

She turned to Edward. “Edward Russell.”

Edward straightened. “Yes, Lady Carol. What may I do for you?”

She smiled. “Edward, he is under your care, and I do not expect Titus to fail.”

Edward met her eyes. “Lady Carol, his abilities far surpass mine at his age. We are—were—flying out to the processing station tonight.”

Lady Carol nodded. “Are. Good day, sir.”

She turned to Titus, walked over, leaned close, and whispered: “We are here for you, my Lord.”

Then she walked out the door.

Titus stared after her. “She called me my Lord.”

His vision blurred.

He fainted 

Edward and Hale pick the young man up looking at each other . Edward laughed 

I wonder what she said .

Let’s get him on the couch

Lifting the young man on to the couch they stare at each other . Edward “ what the hell just happened “

Hale “ pulling the device from his computer showing it to Edward . This was delivered the day he got here . Right before you went one on one .

Edward , Damn you what you got me into .

Hale “ Eddie do you think he’s a good kid “

Edward better than you or I at his age .

Hale I heard you tell her about his skills is he really that good

Edward : not really but she needed to hear it . Edward winks “Spike he’s the best damn pilot I’ve ever seen .”

When Hale heard Russel call him Spike he smiled a nickname only Russel uses when he is serious

Hale looking over hey he’s alive Seeing Titus eyes are open . They start laughing

Edward Did you hear what she said about the trip tonight Yes she said Are

Ok what about the girls No matter what we say they will not believe us .

Hale palming the chit he was given

Walking over to a scanner inserting the chit Looking Edward come here

Edward walking over Hale pointing .

Edward damn I guess you better keep your mouth shut

The station kept turning.

And somewhere ahead, in the quiet offices of Logistics, answers—or more questions—were waiting

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Lady Carol Winfield moved through the corridors like a blade through silk—silent, precise, every step deliberate. The evening cycle had deepened; amber lights bled into near-darkness, the station’s pulse slow and intimate. She had chosen quarters close to the gym ring on purpose—proximity to the entanglement node was everything with QEC. When Titus sent that message, the fluctuation had lit up her terminal before he’d even finished his cooldown stretches.

She palmed her door. It hissed open.

Inside, the room was spare: dark steel walls, a single holo-portrait of her sister on the desk, a crystal vial of Phorantis soil (Vickie’s gift, years ago), and the QEC unit itself—small, matte, unremarkable—resting in its cradle like a coiled serpent.

Carol sat. She exhaled once—long, controlled—then activated the device.

The connection snapped into existence—silent, instantaneous, no lag, no trace. The other end answered before the first breath finished.

A voice—older, warmer, edged with the same unyielding steel Carol carried—filled the room.

“Sister.”

Carol’s lips curved, but her eyes stayed sharp. “Victoria.”

A pause. Then the voice again, quieter, sensing the tension. “You only use my full name when something’s broken. What happened?”

Carol leaned forward, elbows on the desk, fingers steepled. “The boy sent a message. The fluctuation was detected. Hale contained it—barely. Four people know there’s a QEC.”

Victoria’s breath caught—just a fraction. “Four.” Plus Titus 

“Edward Russell—his instructor. No issue there. The other two are young. Friends. One of them…” Carol’s voice softened, almost reluctant. “He’s already moved fast. Or they were right for each other.”

A long silence on the other end.

Then Victoria, soft: “Glad to hear he found someone. I know he was hurting after the last one moved. Was best—she didn’t want children. Not the life partner he needs.”

Carol nodded to the empty room. “What’s her name?”

The question came careful, deliberate—the way Victoria always asked when something mattered.

“Kelly Raven.”

The line went dead quiet.

Then Victoria’s voice—sharp, almost disbelieving: “What did you say?”

“Kelly Raven,” Carol repeated, slower, letting the name hang like smoke.

Another pause—longer, heavier.

Victoria exhaled, the sound carrying two centuries of secrets. “Is she… twenty-one, twenty-two?”

Carol glanced at the terminal, pulled up the quick tracker “Twenty-two.”

Here family is under our protection 

“Yes.”

Victoria’s voice dropped to a near-whisper. “Carol… could they become a couple?”

Carol smiled—small, knowing, a little sad. “Not sure yet. Young hormones. But the spark is there. I saw it in his face when her name came up.”

 “Thank you. I’ll talk to Vickey tomorrow. Explain what happened.”

Carol leaned back. “She’ll understand. 

The connection held for a heartbeat longer . 

Then Victoria spoke again, quieter still.

“Carol… if they have children…”

Carol smiled saying they will be beautiful. 

Victoria ask have you spoken to the girls “ Carol I was going to meet them soon “

Victoria sis this is just a mishap nothing more . Love you

1qiviqk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qiviqk,What would you put in this awkward space?,"Hi Reddit!


I'm just looking for advice on what to put in this little area that goes from my kitchen to my living room. (Sorry for the clutter. I've been hectcially re-arranging, lol.)

I have a smaller, 700' apartment. I'm always looking for something to maximize functionality. Like more table space, or storage. I was also considering some kind of set up with a mini-fridge. Coffee stand?

I previously had an fishtank stand here, but didn't like the way it flowed into the living room . maybe a divider of sorts to help make the spaces more clearly defined?

... 

I was thinking of getting the IKEA Resaro table and having it stick longways from the wall, so I could use both sides of the extendable table. That way it makes a little divider, gives table space.

1qivf78,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qivf78,i am the victim of Psychic attacks,"hi, this is just a prior Warning that what you're about to read may prove shocking or upsetting. 


it is my belief that i have been the recipitent of psychic attacks and planned sabotage of my life over the past 3+ months. this has manifested in several ways, such as migraines, nauseas and flu like symptoms, to emotional dysfunction or panics, tears and more,, to specific life events like the loss of my Job a few months ago. or the sending of actual people (bad actors) into my life to hurt me. 


i have also come to believe the culprit is Katy Perry. I began to understand this when I started to find video appearances or music by Miss Perry incredibly overwhelming and distressing. At first, it manifested in a faint tinnitus like symptoms triggered by hearing her songs, but it steadily got worse. 
Last week, i saw her photo and burst into tears. I then knew. This is the woman who hurt me. 


My life has materialy and tangibly changed for the worse since this shift took place a few months ago. I have been unable to find another job, partly because any time i try to open my laptop to do an application i am struck down with a massive head ache. i thought maybe i just need to get out of the house, maybe i can go to wetherspoons and get the £1.49 hot chocolate (no longer free refillable but u can then get a coffee flat white or other) but i went and i just drinking alcohol instead to drown out her voice in my head telling me im not good enough and not worth it. 


Over the past week I have felt genuinely fearful but mostly confused about what is going on right now. i have always wondered if i have adhd or Other, and many people on this website have always said Hi clem are you on the spectrum? but this is another lever of executive dysfunction and I'm just not sure how to manage anymore. 


I just dont know why this is happening. why have things been getting worse, and why cant i seem to get my life back on track no matter what I try? well, I know why. its Katty Perry's fault that's why. but why is she doing this to me? is it because i didnt stream her 153 album? but I liked her old songs like ""Hot N Cold"" and ""california dreaming"" and ""You're So Gay"" so i dont see what the problem is? i  was never a hater! 


so please, don't stream Katy Perry music anymore, seriously.  dont support her anymore, we all loved her songs but enough is enough, it crosses the line when people get hurt.

1qivefo,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1qivefo/why_the_world_seems_to_be_falling_apart_and_why/,Why the World Seems to Be Falling Apart (and Why It Always Has),"Now then, when the Hindus speak of the Yugas, people in the modern West tend to imagine something like a cosmic calendar pinned to the wall of the universe. Satya Yuga on Monday, Treta on Tuesday, Dvapara on Wednesday, and then, alas, Kali Yuga, the dreadful Friday afternoon when the office is closing down and everyone has already gone to the pub.

But that, of course, is not quite the point.

The Yugas are not dates. They are patterns. And the reason they continue to make sense, even to people who don’t believe in gods with blue skin or cosmic turtle, is because they describe something extraordinarily familiar: how things fall apart when they become complicated.

And this, you see, is not mystical at all.

⸻

Entropy: Why Tidy Rooms Never Stay Tidy

Let us begin with a very unfashionable word: entropy.

Entropy is simply the tendency of things to move from order to disorder unless energy is continuously applied.

A child’s bedroom is a perfect demonstration. You don’t need to try to make it mess, it happens automatically. But if you want it tidy, ah, that takes work.

Now morality works in rather the same way.

In what the Hindus call Satya Yuga, society is simple enough that virtue maintains itself. People know one another. Actions have immediate consequences. If you behave badly, everyone knows by lunchtime. No committees are required.

But as time goes on, and by “time” I mean complexity, the system expands. Cities grow. Populations explode. The web of cause and effect becomes so tangled that no one quite knows who is responsible for what anymore.

And so, just like the bedroom, ethical order requires increasing effort merely to stay where it is.

Eventually, the effort becomes exhausting.

That is entropy, not evil, not sin, just the natural drift of systems left unattended.

⸻

Why Large Societies Need Rules (and Why Rules Don’t Work)

In a small village, morality is personal. In a civilization of hundreds of millions, morality must be codified.

So we invent laws.

But laws are fascinating things. They are not expressions of virtue; they are substitutes for it. A society only needs ten commandments when people have stopped naturally knowing what not to do.

In early Yugas, morality is embodied, you are good.

In later Yugas, morality is regulate, you are required to behave.

And once morality becomes something enforced from the outside, it begins to decay from the inside.

For rules invite loopholes.

And loopholes invite cleverness.

And cleverness, divorced from wisdom, is precisely what Kali Yuga specializes in.

⸻

Technology: Power Without Maturity

Now here is where people get confused. They say, “But surely we are more advanced now?”

Oh yes, immensely more powerful. But power is not wisdom.

Technology magnifies whatever it touches. Give a saint a microphone and you hear a blessing. Give a scoundrel one and you hear propaganda.

In earlier ages, human capacity for harm was limited by muscle and distance. Today, a single individual can cause devastation while sitting comfortably with a cup of coffee.

And yes, our nervous systems are still those of tribal primates. We evolved to handle maybe a hundred relationships, not five thousand online opinions before breakfast.

This is what psychologists call an evolutionary mismatch: our tools have grown faster than our ability to use them wisely.

So Kali Yuga is not about wickedness, it is about overpowered children.

⸻

Atrophy: Why Inner Muscles Waste Away

There is another simple biological principle worth mentioning: atrophy.

A muscle that is not used shrinks. It doesn’t become evil. It simply weakens.

Spiritual discipline, attention, restraint, silence, patience, are muscles. In early societies, they were necessary for survival. If you lacked self-control, you starved. If you lacked patience, you died.

But in an age of comfort, those inner muscles are no longer required. And so, quite naturally, they weaken.

This is why Kali Yuga texts say that spiritual realization becomes both rarer and easier. Rarer, because fewer people practice. Easier, because when collapse is complete, there is nothing left to cling to.

⸻

Why Consequences No Longer Teach Us

Morality, like learning, depends on feedback.

Touch fire, get burned. Lesson learned.

But modern action rarely produces visible consequences. You can exploit someone on the other side of the world and never see their face. You can poison the future gradually enough that no single moment feels responsible.

And when cause and effect separate, moral intelligence collapses.

This is not wickedness, it is confusion.

⸻

From Being to Appearing

Perhaps the clearest sign of Kali Yuga is the shift from being to appearing.

Once, identity was internal.

Then it became occupational.

Then it became material.

Now it is performative.

“I am” became “I do.”

“I do” became “I have.”

“I have” became “I seem.”

And once appearance replaces essence, morality becomes theater.

⸻

Why Everyone Thinks They Live in the Worst Age

Now here is the punchline.

Every age believes it lives in Kali Yuga.

Why? Because awareness increases as coherence declines. When systems are simple, no one reflects on them. When they become chaotic, everyone suddenly becomes a philosopher.

The Yuga myth survives because it does something profoundly compassionate:

It explains decline without blaming individuals.

It says, “Of course things feel mad, that’s the nature of cycles.”

And that, you see, is not pessimism. It is relief.

⸻

The Cosmic Joke

So are the Yugas literal epochs? Possibly.

Are they psychological states? Almost certainly.

Are they repeating patterns in every civilization, every life, every mind?

Undoubtedly.

And here is the real joke:

The moment you understand Kali Yuga, you are no longer entirely in it.

Because clarity itself is a form of Satya.

So the world may be falling apart, but it always was.

And yet, somehow, it continues dancing.

And if you can laugh at that, gently, without cynicism, you are doing exactly what the sages recommended all along.

Not fixing the universe.

Not escaping it.

But understanding the game well enough to enjoy playing your part.

And that, after all, is very Hindu indeed.",6,1768994771.0,hinduism,6,1.0,False

Im 28M and stayed for about 3yrs  in an apartment block next door to an older couple .  I got to know them fairly well and about 6 months ago the man was diagnosed terminally ill and has gone down hill rapidly to the point he’s now bedridden and the woman is his 24/7 carer .  Their kids are a fair way away and I offer to get essentials from the shop daily and she asks me to do odd jobs.  She has a baby monitor radio so he can call so when he is resting she comes over for a coffee and a chat just to get out , but still within radio distance if he wakes . 

She has really been taking stain and opens up about her emotions to me and often gets teary and hug and comfort her .  This has progressed to the point she always hugs and kisses me when we see each other and same when she leaves to go back inside . 

He is 63 and she is 54.

The other night she came over and brought supper over so she would have company at a table . After eating I went and sat in the couch and she followed and came and sat next to me , up close and sort of rested her head in my shoulder and arm across my lap and held me pretty tight .  Out of nowhere she admitted she really missed intimacy with her husband and I sympathised and put my arm around her and pulled her closer in and we sat for a long while in silence . 

She broke it off and said she needed to check on hubby and may come back . I started washing up and a few minutes later later she returned and cane up behind me at the sink and put her arms around me pressing her boobs into my back and hugged me tight again telling me he was sound askeep and probably sleep for the next few hours .

She blurted straight out : ‘ I miss this warmth and togetherness , can I spend the night with you !’ I must say she has always been attractive in my eyes but obviously knowing she was married and a lot older never even thought beyond friendship .  

We just got in bed and lay there and both went to sleep 

This happened regularly and eventually every night she was there .  We were really growing attached and one  night the inevitable happened and we had sex .  It was like a huge release for her but she became very emotional when we finished blaming herself and cursing herself for letting it happen .  She actually ignored me a couple of days - poor woman was obviously trying to process what was happening . 

On about the third day I texted her and invited her over for supper - she said she would love to .  She arrived beautifully done up and dress really cute so I upped my game and treated it like a date night .   We ended up having mind blowing sex and it’s carried on from there …..

I'm a long-time lurker and a huge fan of the ingenuity in this community. I wanted to share a side project I've been working on that solves a problem I think many of us who track our fitness goals can relate to: tedious, time-consuming food logging.

I've been counting calories and macros for years, but the constant manual entry was the #1 reason I'd fall off track. It felt like a chore, not a tool. So, I decided to build the solution I always wanted: NutriSnap AI Tracker.

The core idea is simple: make logging so fast, you can't use ""I don't have time"" as an excuse.

# How it works (The Tech):

1. Voice Logging: You just speak what you ate (""Hey NutriSnap, I had a chicken salad with ranch and a black coffee""), and our AI instantly calculates the macros and calories. This is the 5-second cheat code.

2. Photo/Scanner: Snap a photo of your meal or scan a barcode, and the AI recognizes it.

3. The Backend: It uses a combination of advanced LLMs and a custom-trained food recognition model to achieve a level of accuracy and speed that traditional apps just can't match.

I'm sharing this here because I'm genuinely proud of the tech and the problem it solves. It's been a massive undertaking, and I'm now at the stage where I'm looking for real-world feedback from fellow builders and fitness enthusiasts.

I'm not here to sell you anything. I'm here to share a tool I built to solve my own problem, and hopefully, it can help others in this community too.

I'd love to hear your thoughts, especially on the technical implementation and any features you think would make it even better.

In theory it sounds calm and mature. In practice it’s messing with my head. I’m in a pretty normal situation: full course load, part time work, trying to not live on instant noodles, and my brain goes into procrastination mode the second I open a textbook. I tried doing the whole structured thing: fixed study blocks, Pomodoro, planning my week on Sunday, even setting up a “nice” desk so I’d feel like a Real Student. It works for like 3 days. Then life happens, I miss one day, and suddenly the plan feels “broken.” And once it feels broken I start thinking why bother, I already failed. Then I panic, do a huge cram session, drink too much coffee, sleep badly, and spend the next day feeling stupid and behind. The worst part is it makes me weirdly secretive. I’ll tell friends “yeah I’m keeping up” even when I’m not, becuase I’m embarrassed that I can’t do the simplest advice on earth.



So I want to ask this sub for actual opinions, not motivational posters. Is “every day” a helpful rule for you, or does it create more stress than it solves? If you think it’s helpful, what makes it work without turning into perfectionism? Like, do you define it as 15 minutes no matter what, or do you have a backup plan for bad days? And if you think it’s overrated, what do you do instead that still keeps you progressing? I’m especially curious about arguments, not just tips. Convince me. If you’re team consistency, tell me why it’s worth pushing through the messy middle. If you’re team flexibility, tell me how you avoid the slippery slope into “I’ll do it tomorrow” forever.

I used to have a fuel generator, but it wasn’t very reliable. Fuel runs out fast, it’s noisy, and sometimes neighbors complain if I run it during the day. So now I’m leaning toward a portable power station that’s quiet and efficient.

My main goal is keeping the fridge running during long outages. We have a big family, and we also store insulin in the fridge, so reliability over multiple days is critical. Beyond that, I’d like to occasionally power some normal household appliances like an electric kettle, toaster, coffee maker, or a small space heater.

There are plenty of brands out there such as Bluetti, Ecoflow, Anker, etc. I’m looking at capacities around 3–4 kWh, but I’m still unsure which model to go with. One thing I've noticed is that Bluetti has invested a lot of effort in reducing the no-load power consumption of its AC inverters.For example, the Bluetti Elite 400 has an AC inverter idle of just 12 W. That seems huge for long-term efficiency, but almost none of the popular PPS recommendation threads I’ve seen mention standby power at all.

Small businesses in past decades would go out on their own to gather customers through word of mouth, flyers, and local phone book. Should you make the best bread in town, you were sooner or later discovered by the town. But times have changed. Storefront is no longer found just on Main Street, but it is on the internet. Instead of being a choice, digital marketing today is a survival tool of businesses.

The Visibility is the New Credibility The thing is not difficult, as we are already online with your customers. As recent statistics produced by SEO.com indicate, 97 percent of the consumers will visit the online presence of a business before making any decision whether to visit it or not. When a prospective client types in the query plumbers near me or best coffee shop in the search engine, and you are not there, you are technically not there.

The resume in the modern world is your online presence in the form of your webpage and social networks. In their absence, the consumers tend to cast doubt in the authenticity of a business.

The Zero Moment of Truth Google coined Zero Moment of Truth (ZMOT) to refer to the fraction of a second when a consumer picks up the phone to read about a product that he or she has just received news about. When a small business employs the use of SEO to feature prominently during such a search, they are able to secure the customer even before he or she steps into a store.

These statistics support the importance of this: search engines contribute nine of all traffic on websites. Unless you are search optimizing, you are missing the tremendous majority of the people consulting to purchase what you are selling.

Leveling the Playing Field One of the best benefits of digital marketing is the fact that it democratizes advertising. A small store in the past cannot compete with a TV budget of a big retailer. The math of digital marketing is different.

Using Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and social media advertising, small business can now attain laser targeted demographics. You do not have to pay to reach everybody (as it is in the case of a newspaper advertisement); you just pay to reach the individuals who are likely to purchase you. This enables the local stores to match the large chains at a quarter of the price.

Real-World Case: The Local Bakery In the case of a local bakery, as mentioned by SocialSellinator. They were experiencing problems in attracting new traffic even though they had great products. They have chosen not to spend money on general print advertisements, and they have turned to social media.

They did geo-targeting so that they only displayed the ads to those who lived within five miles of the shop and had high-quality photos of the pastries. The result? It was not only likes but real sales. Leading the local online discussion they drove to the stores and more money in their coffers, and proved themselves able to be competitive to other bigger coffee chains around the area.

The Strength of Data and ROI Unlike with a billboard where one can only speculate on the number of people who have seen it, digital marketing is a measurable tool. Applications such as Google Analytics help the business owners to know where all the dollars are spent.

Efficiency is important to businesses with very strict budgets. One of the most effective customer retention tools such as email marketing is still available. Studies indicate that email promotions will give an average Return on Investment (ROI) of 36:1.

Conclusion No longer is it the building and hope they come age. In the circumstances of small business, digital marketing is a low cost, highly accurate and quantifiable method of expansion. It helps to connect a local store with the world and transform Internet searches into physical purchases. Whether a small business can afford to do digital marketing or not is a question that should be answered in 2024 and afterwards.",1,1768993340.0,smallbusinessindia,2,1.0,False

Just a little bit of a rant if im honest, turned 40 at the weekend, just wanted a day off to do nothing, nothing special just time to catch up on me and spend time with the family. 
I like to think im an average guy, but having spent time in a primarily womens focussed gym, it seems I do alot more than the average guy. 
Making sure the house is clean and tidy, getting on top of the chores to free up time to spend with my partner, trying to save to improve things and generally helping where I can to lighten the load. 
Well turns out that was the completely wrong thing to do, dumped at a moments notice because I do too much! Christ, what has it come to when you help out your other half and that is a problem! 

My partner and I have been together for 8 years, moved in together after the first year as I bought a house and her landlord was selling, moved away from my home town and helped to raise a 2 year old into a kind and considerate 10 year old. She was easily overwhelmed with stuff to do so when I had any free time, I would do a little extra to help out and lighten the load a little bit. 

Now we have had problems recently, or well i have, that she has been meeting new friends with 1 thing in common, they are all single men. At first I just thought it was her making friends and trying to have more of a social life, but as time went on, one of those blocked her and it was like a break up had happened by the way she acted. 
This of course raised some suspicion. 
Then the latest one she has been messaging every night, all night, even staying up until 1-2am messaging. This then started to become spending time with him, going for coffee, going shopping, and then eventually spending time at his home to watch series he had mentioned. 
Of course, like anyone this looked suspicious, and after many conversations with close friends, their suspicions were raised too. 
Well the tipping point came the Monday morning after my birthday. 
I got asked if we had any plans for the following weekend, and not being a complete plan things in advance from weekend to weekend, we hadn't made any. 
And then was told that she wanted to go to the cinema this weekend to see the new silent hill film. 
For context I am an avid gamer, its my favourite form of entertainment and have played the recent remake and silent hill f whilst she has been there (being 18 rated I can only play it in the evening or weekend when her son has gone to his dads) i have even mentioned that it was coming out. We just hadn't planned to see it yet.

So of course, this causes an argument. 
After a 5 hour chat about things she comes to the conclusion that she hasn't been happy for a long time.
And the reason she wasnt happy....because I do everything. 
I help with her chores, I give her and her son a lift into work and school every morning regardless of if it makes me late for work or not. 

I have been going crazy for weeks thinking she is cheating and thats what it boils down to?! 

Im done. This shit is far too difficult nowadays. ",2,1768993318.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.76,False

Hi everyone!
I’ll be visiting Istanbul soon (in late March), and I’m looking for a local Turkish friend who could help me understand the city better and experience it in an authentic way.
I’m a 21-year-old guy 👨, calm and respectful. I’m not looking for anything weird — just friendly company and a chance to learn more about local life.

I’d really love to:
visit a real Turkish bath (hamam) — I’ve heard it’s something next level and want to try the authentic experience
try proper döner and the famous Turkish ice cream (the one everyone talks about 😄)
explore real places, not just the usual tourist spots
understand local transport, prices, and daily life
buy authentic souvenirs to take home

I’m interested in culture, history, art, and everyday local life, not partying. We can just walk around, talk, drink tea or coffee, take photos, and enjoy the city together.

Also, if you’re interested, we can practice languages together —
you can practice English with me, and I can practice Turkish with you. Casual conversations, no pressure 🙂
If you’re from Istanbul (or live there now) and don’t mind helping a traveler — I’d really appreciate it.
You can comment here or DM me. Thanks in advance! 🇹🇷✨",1,1768993157.0,u_NoMortgage3450,0,1.0,False

I’m 31 and work from home in an ops-ish role. The pattern is boringly consistent: I’ll have a task that’s not even hard (write a short report, answer a batch of emails, update a spreadsheet, book a dentist appt, even clean the kitchen) and I avoid it all day. I’ll do tiny busywork, reorganize tabs, clean my desktop, scroll for “a minute”, make coffee, and keep telling myself I’ll start after lunch, then after one more email, then after I tidy something. The worst part is I’m not relaxing either , I’m thinking about the task the whole time. Then late at night I get a jolt of panic, crank it out fast, and feel wired and annoyed with myself. I go to bed too late, wake up tired, and the next day starts already behind. It happens with personal chores too, so it’s not just work.

I’ve tried the obvious stuff: to-do lists, Pomodoro timers, calendar blocks, putting my phone in another room, and website blockers. It works for a couple  days and then I quietly stop doing it, or I “optimize” the system instead of doing the task. Once I actually start, I can focus fine and I’m pretty fast, so it really feels like the first 60 seconds are the problem. I notice I avoid more when the first step is fuzzy (“do admin”) or when I want the first pass to be perfect, which is dumb because I dont even feel proud of the late-night version. I’m not looking for a diagnosis or deep therapy, just practical strategies that real people use to start on normal days when there’s no fire. What routines, tricks, or setups have actually helped you break this kind of loop, and what do you do in the moment when you catch yourself bargaining for 10 more minutes?

basically, what the title says. i'm a student living on a university campus, so a lot of the coffee options either don't taste great or are more expensive than is reasonable for me (or both </3). thus, i was thinking about getting an espresso machine to save money and time in the long run—also, I like coffee, i want to be able to experiment with things on my own, want to learn more, etc etc.. 

however, i have relatively little knowledge about different espresso machines and brands, which is why i wanted to ask here. i have been looking online at places like bestbuy and i've seen names like de'longhi and breville pop up a lot (and some good deals on them at the moment), so if anyone has recommendations for or against those please let me know.

  
some quickfire information:

* upper limit for budget is around 250$ with a little bit of room, but not >300$
* located in canada
* i tend to drink americanos and lattes, usually iced, so I'm more concerned about pulling the shot than milk-related components/activities

After a brief discussion of the ingredients, I will put the recipe below. Give it a try and let me know what you think!

Benefits of ingredients:

Greek yogurt has less whey than regular yogurt, and therefore “has even more protein than regular yogurt.” It is also rich in probiotics and high in vitamin B12. (https://www.realsimple.com/greek-yogurt-health-benefits-7182253). Plain Greek yogurt is lower in sugar and therefore much better for you - be sure to read your labels when purchasing. (My preferred brands are Fage and Chobani.)

“Coffee … contains antioxidants and other active substances that may reduce internal inflammation and protect against disease, say nutrition experts from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.” https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/9-reasons-why-the-right-amount-of-coffee-is-good-for-you. Actually, I recommend you read that article – it turns out coffee is kind of amazing, health-wise. Also – they provide an interesting recipe at the end of the article, too. Reminder: caffeine should not be used by some folks depending on age, health, pregnancy … listen to the experts on this.

“Honey is rich in nutrients and antioxidants, has antibacterial properties, and can play a role in diabetes management as part of a balanced diet.” (https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-honey)

“Cinnamon is rich in antioxidants and other beneficial compounds. Some research suggests that it may help support blood sugar control, protect against heart disease, and reduce inflammation.” (https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-benefits-of-cinnamon)

Vanilla may have many beneficial properties. It is rich in antioxidants, and may reduce inflammation, especially of the liver. “Research on the cardiovascular impact of vanilla, particularly its active ingredient, vanillin, has shown that it can measurably reduce cholesterol levels in the body.” The scent is “known to directly impact the brain and induce calmness… Some research has pointed to vanilla as a weight loss aid, due to its potentially appetite-suppressing properties. The extract of this plant is also known to help lower cholesterol levels, making your body and metabolism more efficient, and effectively supporting weight loss goals.” (https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/herbs-and-spices/vanilla.html)

I’ve been in a happy relationship for a year, but after my girlfriend spent 6 weeks abroad, our first time meeting again felt awkward and forced, like we didn’t know how to act around each other. She later said she didn’t have a good time, and we agreed we were both trying too hard. She’s asked for a few days of space to process things before we meet again, but now I’m worried this might be the start of the end and I’m unsure how much space to give her OR the next steps I need to take since we usually message a lot.

So I’ve been with this girl for about 1 year, and I love her deeply. However she’s been away for the last 6 weeks visiting family who live in another country. We would FaceTime every 2-3 days to catch up as she was quite busy and I was working there was a 6 hour  time zone difference and we were happy with that giving each other updates, catching up and yapping for hours etc with no problems.

However she came back a few days ago, gave her time to rest and recover from the travelling and jet lag and we finally met up again yesterday. I was weirdly nervous to see her in person again and i picked her up from her house to come to mine and it was just like our minds had frozen and we didn’t know what to talk about. It was we were meeting for the very first time again and we’re just making small talk. Anyway we go coffee and a lunch at a cafe before going to mine to chill (as that was why we had planned weeks ago just to be with each other again)

The whole vibe was weird, and everything felt forced from both of us and neither of us were acting normal. After I dropped her home in the evening she phoned me and was very upset saying that she didn’t have a particularly good time for the reasons that I mentioned. And we both agreed that we were trying too hard and maybe that made everything feel unnatural. Anyway she said she wanted a few days just to think about what happened and to process it and we will try to meet up on the weekend to talk about it. The messages since have already felt a little same old same old and I’m just worried this is the beginning of the end really :(

It’s the first issue we’ve really had and I told her it’s not always going to be smooth sailing but she don’t seem to happy with me saying that

How much space should I be giving her over the next few days as I do like to message her quite a bit usually",2,1768992072.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

When Lucas Thorne walked out with his suitcase, I was a small, shivering bundle, swallowed by my overcoat as I curled up on the sofa.
He paused, his back ramrod straight, and glanced over his shoulder just once.
In the silent, sterile light of the afternoon, he offered no final words.
He just left.
And I I never even lifted my head.
The door clicked shut.
My head remained bowed for a long, long time before I finally found the strength to look up, to face the light pouring in from the window.
It felt like the whole world had abandoned me.
My own husband didn't want me anymore.
He, too, believed I was rotten to the core.
And he was right. I didn't deserve anyone's forgiveness.
My hand, trembling, found its way to my stomach.
Just a week ago, a tiny, four-month-old baby was nestled here.
But it slipped away, silent and unseen.
I was so lonely. All I ever wanted was a little baby of my own. I would have taught him to read, to sing, to say Mama.
But that dream was gone now.
The title of Mrs. Thorne was never meant for me. This was my punishment, wasn't it? For stealing a role that belonged to someone else.
I slumped against the arm of the sofa, a hollow laugh escaping my lips.
""I think... I think I'm really out of strength.""
After sitting there for what felt like an eternity, I slowly rose and walked to the console table. I picked up the silver picture frame and laid it face down.
Some say love is forever.
But for me, love was over.
2
My hand was steady as I flicked the lighter, the tiny flame dancing as I held it to the corner of the heavy curtain tassel.
Then, the phone rang, shrill and insistent.
I turned my head, hesitating for a second, but I let it ring.
It didn't stop. It just kept calling, a relentless demand.
Finally, I picked it up.
""Hello?""
""Why didn't you answer?"" The voice was cold, impatient. My mother.
I watched the flame catch, a small orange flower blooming on the fabric. ""Is something wrong?""
""Stella's liver they're saying there's a problem. You need to go to the hospital and get tested as a match.""
I coughed, a dry, racking sound.
""Are you even listening to me?""
I nodded, though she couldn't see. The smoke was getting thicker, clawing at my throat. I coughed again, harder this time.
""I understand.""
""What's with that cough?""
""Too much smoke,"" I rasped. ""Something's burning.""
I didn't wait for a reply. I dropped the phone, grabbed the small fire extinguisher from the kitchen, and blasted the nascent flame until it was nothing but a charred, ugly smudge.
When the fire was out, I tossed the extinguisher aside and collapsed onto the scorched corner of the sofa, gasping for air.
Finally, my hand moved to rest over my liver.
My liver?
Fine.
If this was one last way I could help Stella, then maybe maybe it would be enough to atone for my sins.
3
When I arrived at the hospital, my parents were already waiting outside her room.
""What took you so long?"" my mother snapped, her foot tapping impatiently on the polished floor.
My gaze was flat, lifeless, as I took in the two people who had given me life but never a home.
My father eventually placed a restraining hand on her arm. ""That's enough,"" he murmured.
He led the way into the hospital room.
My eyes immediately found the bed, but the first person I saw wasn't my sister. It was Lucas.
My gaze dropped to the floor, deliberately ignoring the flicker of shock in his eyes.
""I have to get to the office,"" he said, rising to his feet. He gave my parents a stiff nod.
For a man who was always so composed, he seemed almost flustered as he brushed past me.
I lifted my head and stared out the window.
Of course.
He had never kept vigil at the hospital for me, not during either of my miscarriages.
I had told myself it didn't hurt anymore.
But in that moment, a familiar sting pricked my eyes.
It was gone as quickly as it came. My eyes were dry again.
4
The person on the bed was pale and still, lost in a deep, colorless sleep.
I raised my hand.
""What do you think you're doing?"" my mother's voice was a harsh command.
My hand simply settled on my sister's head, gently smoothing a few stray strands of hair.
Only after I was done did I turn to face them.
""The compatibility test. When does it start?""
My father seemed momentarily taken aback by the dead, cold calm in my voice.
Just then, the doctor walked in. ""Is she here?"" he asked, before his eyes landed on me. He froze for a second, his professional demeanor faltering.
5
""You're not a suitable candidate for this test.""
I said nothing.
""Nora, are you deaf?"" my mother hissed. ""Go home.""
""I can do it,"" I said, my voice quiet but firm, directed at the doctor. ""Please.""
With that, I turned and walked out of the room.
""You"" the doctor started, following me into the hallway. ""You just had a miscarriage a few days ago. Are you trying to kill yourself?""
I paused at the door, my back to him.
""It's just a test. It won't kill me.""
Behind me, I heard him let out a long, weary sigh.
6
The number of tests they ran was endless. I ended up staying at the hospital for three days, figuring it was a good enough place to rest and recover.
Finally, on the third day, it was over.
I made my way up to the fifth floor, to the premium private suites. The sight of the perfect little family unitfather, mother, and daughter, all gathered togethermade me stop in my tracks.
It was my father who saw me first, beckoning me over.
I nodded and stepped inside. ""Dad, Mom. Stella.""
""Well?"" my mother asked immediately. ""Are the results back?""
""Not yet.""
""I'm heading home now,"" I said.
My eyes met Stella's for a fleeting second. She looked away almost instantly, her gaze dropping to her lap.
""Fine, you can go,"" my mother said, dismissing me with a wave of her hand.
I nodded again.
Just as I reached the door, my father called out.
""Nora. I think Lucas must have dropped this. Could you take it to him?""
I turned. He was holding out a small, intricately carved silver locket. It hung from a delicate chain, catching the light. I stared at it, frozen.
""We found it the day Lucas was here.""
My eyes instinctively flickered to Stella and my mother, then back to the locket. Reluctantly, I reached out and took it.
""Okay.""
As the door closed behind me, I heard their hushed voices.
""What are you doing? Are you afraid she won't get to see him enough?""
""Something is wrong between them. I'm afraid they're not going to make it.""
I walked down the silent corridor and didn't look back.

Thorne Enterprises.
I waited for half an hour before Lucas finally finished his meeting.
He strode into his office, and the moment he saw me, a frown creased his forehead.
I drained the last sip of cold tea from the cup in my hand and stood up, holding out the locket. ""I just came to give you this.""
His eyes fell to the object in my palm, and his frown deepened with impatience.
He didn't take it.
Was it because my hands had touched it? Was I that repulsive to him now?
I turned and placed the locket on the polished surface of his massive desk.
I gave a small nod, ready to leave.
""Wait.""
He walked towards the desk as I walked towards the door.
I stopped. ""Is there something else?""
He gestured to the sofa. ""Sit.""
I stood there, motionless, for a few seconds. He took off his suit jacket but didn't speak, his hands clenching and unclenching at his sides.
I decided to break the silence. ""Are you here to ask if the test was a success?""
I was about to say the results weren't back yet, but my phone vibrated in my pocket.
I pulled it out.
At the same moment, his phone buzzed on the desk.
I understood. He had been monitoring the results from the hospital all along.
A small, bitter smile touched my lips. ""If there's nothing else, I'll go home. I should rest up, make sure I'm in the best possible condition for the surgery.""
I was about to pull the door open when he spoke again, his voice strained.
""Nora, after the transplant let's try to make this work. For real.""
My hand froze on the doorknob.
What what did he just say?
Was he finally willing to accept me? To accept the woman he had called the most wicked, manipulative person he knew?
But
I don't want to make it work with you anymore, Lucas.
I'm so tired.
So, so tired.
I didn't answer him.
I just opened the door and walked away.
8
Back home, I put a whole chicken on to simmer and then left the kitchen.
Adrift and empty, I turned on the television, the noise a meaningless buzz in the background.
Eventually, I drifted off, a half-eaten bowl of soup on the coffee table, the TV screen flickering in the dark.
When I woke the next day, I was still on the sofa.
The house was silent, save for the soft rustle of sunlight filtering through the curtains.
This place was too big. Too empty.
I should get a cat.
The thought was a sudden impulse. I grabbed my phone and started scrolling through pictures of kittens from a local shelter. I even picked one out, a little calico with big, curious eyes.
Then I closed the app.
A cat?
No.
A pet is a commitment for life, not a momentary whim to fill the silence.
9
A week before the surgery, I was admitted to the hospital.
My mother came to visit.
She sat for a long time, and we didn't exchange a single word. She didn't speak, and I had nothing to say.
""I'm sorry,"" she finally mumbled, staring at the floor. ""All the private rooms on the fifth floor were taken. Otherwise, your father and I would have booked one for you.""
I just nodded, turning my head to look out the window.
""You used to be such a sweet talker when you were little. I don't know what happened to you."" She sighed and stood up. ""Well, I'm going back upstairs. I'll come see you again later.""
""Okay.""
She left.
My gaze drifted to the chair where she had sat, and to the basket of fruit she had left on the floor beside it.
A small, humorless smile played on my lips. The way she had clutched the basket, shifting her weight awkwardly before scurrying outit was almost comical.
She felt guilty? Was that even possible?
I really couldn't understand her. Couldn't she have just left the fruit upstairs with Stella and then come down to see me?
But no.
She detested me.
Why would she ever make a special trip just for me?
10
Today was the last round of pre-op checks. The surgery was tomorrow.
I returned to my room, clutching a folder full of my medical reports.
The room was as cold and empty as ever.
I sat on the edge of the bed, my mind adrift.
Why was it so quiet?
Oh, right.
Lucas. Didn't he say he wanted to ""make things work""?
He never came home during the days I was recovering. He hadn't visited me once during the week I'd been in the hospital.
Was this his idea of trying?
No.
He said after the surgery, we'd make things work.
I knew what it really meant. It wasn't about love. It was about debt. He felt he owed me, and he was willing to pay with the rest of his life.
As long as Stella was healthy, he would have nothing left to wish for.
11
The day of the surgery.
Just as Stella and I were about to be wheeled into the operating theater, Lucas arrived, rushing down the hall.
""Dad, Mom, I'm so scared,"" Stella whimpered.
""It's okay, sweetie, it's okay,"" my mother cooed, adjusting the surgical cap on Stella's head. ""Just think of it as taking a nap. The doctor said you'll be perfectly healthy when you wake up.""
""Are they going in now?"" Lucas asked, breathless.",1,1768992072.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

My wife is turning 40 at the end of January, and we’ll be in Krabi / Ao Nang at the time. I’m trying to plan a special surprise for her.

**Restaurant recommendations**

She works in hospitality, so she’s pretty picky when it comes to restaurants 😅  
I’ve currently booked a “bird’s nest” at Saffron (Banyan Tree) — the view looks amazing, but the set menu is very expensive and kind of kills my budget for the rest of the day. Unfortunately, booking a bird’s nest means set menu only.

Do you have any fine dining / romantic restaurant recommendations around Krabi, Ao Nang, or nearby, ideally with a nice view?

**Private sunrise activity**

I’m also looking for a private sunrise experience. Most island tours (private or group) seem to leave around 8am and last half or full day.

What I’d really love is:

* a small private boat
* sunrise on the sea, just the two of us
* maybe breakfast on board
* only a few hours (no island-hopping)

Something around 5:30am would be perfect. I couldn’t find anything like this on GetYourGuide / Klook.  
Does anyone have local contacts or know if this is possible?

**Din Daeng Doi viewpoint**

I also saw Din Daeng Doi viewpoint for sunrise + coffee.

* Is there a walk/hike to reach the top?
* Is it worth it once the sun is up?
* Anyone tried the café there?

**Private boat to go to dinner**

Last question: if we keep Saffron, I’d love to arrive by boat.  
Ideally:

* pick-up at Ao Nang Beach
* sunset cruise with a drink
* drop-off at Tup Kaek Beach for dinner

Any idea:

* how long that boat ride would take?
* how to book something like this without an unlimited budget?

Thanks a lot — really appreciate any tips or local knowledge!",1,1768992052.0,u_Plenty_Judgment_803,0,1.0,False
