but life month later continue and I was heartbroken but working while one day I felt a lot of pain and stranger symptoms never felt that way and I can say I always sick due to my hormonal misbalances in those times my ex husband wanted to be back with me and I was so stupid and needy that I accepted to be back with him and I of course sleep with him with no protection as well, it should be clarified that I after last time I had intimacy with stian I also had intimacy with my ex husband one month later after that


So not making short I discovered I was pregnant because a blood test and I couldn’t believe it I was nervous I puked and i was happy but at the very same moment i became sad because i didn’t if the baby was from Stian or my husband so i was feeling into a predicament, so my husband realized and he was happy but I couldn’t lie him so I told him the truth he was sad but not angry at me because he knew it was 2 years we weren’t together and he was also with other women after he left me because it was him who abandoned me, so i told him i was gonna have it and he was gonna support by putting his last name to the baby and he was sure it was his he didn’t wanted to believe he was incredulous, so i called this guy (after he ignored my calls and my messages for like 2 days) and when finally he pick up the phone told him i was pregnant and that I was sure it was his he started acting aggressively towards me;

Before all of this I wrote his mother and I told her everything that he did to me, and she didn’t like it, 

he reacted by telling me how is possible and I contacted his family and how come this accidents happened because I was also very surprised that DIU can fail but has also 99.99 protection he refused always protection, and this was unfortunate and I told him that I was thinking in having it and he told me he wasn’t gonna support me, that he would never want to meet a bastard kid or even acknowledge his/ her existence, so I told him he didn’t need it to do it I was gonna do it by myself, that I was gonna be single mother, that I was calling him just for let him know that he was gonna have a son or daughter, and he told me that wasn’t true, that I was planning on baby trap him, that he didn’t wanted kids and absolutely never with me a disgusting being, that I was terrible and awful and much more terrible thing that hurt me deeply, so I told him that either way was my decision and he started menacing me and saying that I was gonna ruin his life and he told me that if I didn’t aborted that child he was gonna make sure everyone know the kind of shitty person I am and that I ruined a supposed “innocent man life” the stress was killing me he was writing me telling me when I was thinking in abort, my family was happy they told me not to do it that they would support me and even told me to come back to my country to rise the kid, then various friend from him called me to tell me I was a whore, a disgusting woman manipulating him that I was just gonna baby anchor him, which in reality the piece of shit is him by denying he fucked me and calling me crazy when it was him who always was with the intention and painting a future that wasn’t real at all, I couldn’t hold it anymore because one part of me wanted to have the kid I was exciting finally I was gonna be a mother I didn’t regret being with this man I was in love with him in my heart I made that baby with a lot of love in my mind and loving that man and liking as much as I did, but at the same time the guilt was killing who I was gonna tell my kid his father hatred me and also hated him ? And let’s not say in Norway being a single mother is pretty much seeing as something whack as many people I knew said, And raise him into that lie I was thinking it a lot, I called many places which pregnant women can call for advice and they always convinced me to abort even though I didn’t told them yet the reason which I found monstrous, I was gonna be 2 months pregnant and after so much pressure I couldn’t take it anymore and I decided to ended all, I went to my doctor to appoint an abortion procedure, and what I hate the most is that they needed the father of the kid present which I feel is horrifying knowing well is my body and my choice why he needed to be present? So my husband signed for me but deep down I knew was wrong so I told stian by Facebook messages that I was gonna do it he was fucking happy I never gonna forget the cruelty and the way he made me feel like I was freeing him for something I supposed I did like it was an executioner and he was the stupid victim, in a death row, he was hypocrite saying he cared about me and he was all the time saying ohh that’s nice everything is gonna be well blah blah, when I saw him again I felt so humilliated I felt pressed by him I didn’t wanted to abort never wanted I did it because I couldn’t hold anymore all the harassment I was suffering and I was becoming sick and I couldn’t even work properly and I was having panic attacks it sucked, when the nurse told me this pill ended the pregnancy because they checked me and they told me this world I never gonna forget and were the “the most developed baby we have ever seen” I started to hold my tears but I couldn’t cry I heard as well my baby heartbeat i was crying inside broken felt like nightmare, but I wasn’t gonna give him the satisfaction that he was getting what he wanted, when I was gonna take the pill I started to cry and I told him I don’t want to do this and he was saying is for the best, is for the best, deep down I just don’t wanted his coldness and cruelty was notorious he was smiling and I could see it in the corner of my eye like if my suffering was actually an prize for him, I finished the process and I became sick I started to bleed heavily that much they have to take me to emergencies and I had to stay in the woman’s clinic for 3 days he visited me and was working while I was in bed and like nothing we were speaking I was shocked but I understood it was over I murder my kid, and I couldn’t process it he leave and told me that once they released me from the hospital he would drive me to my house I say no because I didn’t wanted but he insisted, so I just said yes and he leaved me I was in the hospital finally good to leave when they released me and felt like a trail of tears in was in the mother ward I saw so many babies and so many women with their children in their arms I was empty handed, i finally was at the exit of the hospital door when there was a store coffee shop, and I bought some food because I didn’t ate and I was hungry and in that he finally picked me up he told me how I was I said fine, it was a bittersweet trip to my house felt heartbroken everything was over and we didn’t said so much more than me saying that I was sorry that I never intended to ruin the friendship I really coping harder when I reality I was just shamed embarrassed I felt like a loser, and I gave him a chocolate, and he said it was okay now it over, then he left me in my house, after that I didn’t longer received any harassment from his friend of him longer but still have a bills from the hospital that he refused to pay until I begged him because I didn’t have money because I wasn’t working I was really sick and I was living from my savings that weren’t so much because I was gonna start to work again he did, and that was it, i still can’t get over this event I don’t know how to forget this I feel
So guilty disgusted and I never wanted to create so much pain, in these 3 years after that happened I still not have kids I still thinking if I ever gonna have or not, I still married to my husband, but deep inside me I regret fully ny abortion, aborted my baby my healthy baby I feel like a murderer a terrible person that just wanted to help out the fucker that used me because he didn’t wanted to ruin his life, and take responsability, I don’t hate men, but sometimes men are the pain of women,


I’m sorry for all this long paragraph hopefully you guys can read me and give me your opinion you can judge me I just wanted to vent this because I can’t with the people that surrounds me they think I am an terrible woman that I was gonna ruin stian life because I was “desperate” for a man and because I was foreigner and needed a Norwegian to fucking marry me so I stay in Norway blah blah, bullshit never wanted that I just I ever wanted was find a person I could love with honestly and never felt like a weirdo because I wanted to marry and have a family and you know settling down with someone. And build a home a dreams together, at this moment I thinking in finish my Education as health secretary and come back to my country to migrate to US because I feel Norway is been to cruel to me since the beginning I don’t hate Norwegians I love them but I feel maybe isn’t for me after all thanks and goodbye

Now I’ll be honest, her behaviour towards me annoys me but also confuses me. My friends (all guys my age) think am an asshole, though, and that it’s my fault and some even think “she’s playing hard to get”, which I don’t actually think (I think she just wants validation or attention), but apparently I don’t understand cues so here it goes…

We met a reception before our program and she was really talkative and engaging with me (she even teased me during it by calling me a nerd). We texted non stop for a week (until she ended the convo because it wasn’t going anywhere). I never flirted with her nor asked her out on a date, despite finding her attractive and being interested in her because I didn’t want to make things awkward in our master’s cohort. I didn’t go to university to get women after all, but rather a degree…

So I wanted to take things casual and make a new friend. I even called her a friend (when I told her to apply to a prof for a research position and say that me “John” let’s say recommended her as a friend). 

So semester starts and we have a reception and she randomly texts me for the first time, despite already having had classes (where we didn’t talk at all): “hey r u at the reception?” And I replied to her and she was like: “OMG COME SAY HI” and yeah I went to say hi and told her about a dinner to which she said: “can I come???” I told her I had to say bye to my friend and asked if she wanted to come. She met my friend. After we left the place, she said to my face twice while looking at me: “he’s cute”. I got caught off guard and felt down but I accepted it and still had a good time with her walking to the dinner and we talked that evening. 

She then started replying to my stories and being more engaging with me but also being closed off (felt like she was ignoring me in class) but also randomly texted me or replied to my stories to then not reply to my stories and be busy. Yet also saying I should invite her to parties I go to…or that she loves sushi when I told her I was going with friends to a sushi place. She would also disagree with a lot of my points, laugh at whatever I said or presented during class (I always see her smile or try not to grin when I present). Yet she also is inconsistent: she’ll suggest us getting a coffee together, call me and we talk for over an hour, to debating me on topics, but then call other guys cute to my face or text me and not text back unless I go out of my way to text her (send follow up messages). Yet she’ll reply to stories or send me memes. She told me I looked good once when I was dressed nicely for our debate and when I got my haircut. 

Yet she never likes my posts (despite her liking other people’s posts whom she’s less close with), yet she shared stuff about her past, life and culture with me. She randomly send me videos about a carnaval in her home country and wanted me to watch the videos to discuss them with me in-person when we hadn’t talked for weeks… to then go off the radar unless I initiated. 

I told her I did a presentation on a carnaval before to impress a woman back then but that I made a guy friend so it ended nice. She asked me about the guy friend and said he’s cute. I got annoyed and said: “don’t you have a bf?” I saw flowers on your story.

And then she told me that “she wouldn’t ask if she had a bf 😂. And that she gets flowers from multiple guys usually”. 

She randomly texted me at 12:44 at night (after midnight) if I was in a discord channel because she thought she found someone who reminded her of me (it was me). I confirmed in the morning. 

She told me before that she’s kinda controlling in that she ends things etc. and once when I was in a group with her friend, she came to sit with us during the break (I’ve never seen her move in class ever) and I overheard her talking to her friend about “her never messaging a guy first. Or if a guy texts too fast that’s weird”… so it just feels like maybe she’s into immature dating techniques which dont appeal to me. 

I don’t care if she’s not interested in me. But at the very least a friendship where I feel respected would be nice… (okay I feel like she can be harsh to me at times like she teased me the other day when my friend said I made a stupid joke (I’m the class clown) and I said I never say dumb stuff and he said “debatable” and she chimed in out of nowhere and “debatable right??”

1ju4tzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingApps/comments/1ju4tzy/los_angeles_a_revenge_report_by_a_junkie_never/,[Los Angeles] A Revenge Report by a Junkie -- Never ever going back to any dating app,"I installed Hinge for the first time in my life last Monday. I've never used a dating app before. I just wanted to try as a life experience what my other friends were recommending.

Starting from day 1, I got max likes (I think it's 99 or 100) every day. I was able to get the total count since I locked Hinge through an app called 'Opal' - I live a busy life and didn't want distraction. And when I checked the app after 6pm, the last like or rose was sent already at 2-3pm ish. This continued throughout the whole week, ""till I got banned"".

I was chatting with three (out of N) matches outside of Hinge app because I was too slow in response due to this app locker. One through WhatsApp, another person through a korean version whatsapp, and the other person through instagram. (I was communicating with the remaining people through hinge only.)

And this WhtasApp match seemed a bit suspicious as I continued conversation with him. So when this guy asked if the Sunday coffee date is still valid (on Friday night), I said i'm busy this week and the following week. Then he started swearing and cursing at me.. I was a bit scared but at the same time, felt pity for him. I just said bye, and then blocked him, didn't do anything (reporting or something else). Then the following day evening after the app lock ended, I was trying to respond to the matches. But, I couldn't.

That's when I realized something was wrong. 1-2hours later, I got an email from hinge that my account is reported and blocked. At that point, I couldn't even open Hinge app. (I guess there was some delay on the processing so I was still able to log in but couldn't send the messages.) I felt frustrated since I wasn't even able to explain what happened to the matches, and they would think I was some kind of a fraud. My profile is real, although some people would think or want that it's fake.

This is a revenge report, and what makes me scared is that I don't think this WhatsApp guy has a sound mental state. He sent a friend request through discord (I don't know how he even found me in discord) and when I googled his user id, I saw several posts and comments (on Reddit) written by him on LSD and other drug abuses. Although I didn't accept the friend request, I knew it was him since I saw this user name from his online CV.

I really want to report him to police, since I don't feel very safe, and am worried what else he can do moving forward. Like defamation through spreading rumors or sending spam emails to my colleagues, or even worse actually. If he actually does that, I will take appropriate legal actions, and protect my dignity. Just to let you know, if you are watching this. My father is a well-known lawyer and he has some strings to handle this kind of thing. I'll pray for you to become a better person.

This experience traumatized me, and I'm never ever going back to dating app.

I see some other cases like me (for example: [https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/dating-love/dating-app-ban/481309](https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/dating-love/dating-app-ban/481309) from 5 years ago). If Hinge keeps on accepting such shitty reports from vengeful people who got rejected, I don't think your business will be able to maintain successful in the long-run. Hope you can see what you are losing.

PS I'm sry,it's long asf.","**Sera**

Free of her brother for the rest of the morning, Sera hopped down the stairs in such high spirits that even her mother noticed her smile. The two made eye contact, her mother still standing at the door where Seth had dashed out of. Suki’s hand was still on the doorknob, like she was waiting for him to be back already, so she would open it the second she heard his voice or Seth’s signature pounding footsteps, for Sera’s older brother was always running, always running somewhere from somewhere else, and leaving them all behind. Her smile faltered for a brief second as she looked away, and at her mother’s face, vanishing all negative thoughts with that motion as her smile renewed as if it had never left. Suki looked at her in question. 

“Can you believe how idiotic he really is, mum?” she giggled, walking past Suki and into the kitchen. “I cannot understand for the life of me. I outright said, to his face, that I was turning eighteen soon. And he said nothing, did nothing. Just stayed mad at me like a true older brother.”

Suki tilted her chin. “Mad at you? Why was he mad at you this morning?”

Sera paused for a moment, recalling she had literally asked her fully adult brother to smuggle her alcohol from his bartender job. Shoving her mouth full of breadfruit, Sera waved her hand dismissively, shaking her head. She swallowed down hard. “That’s besides the point, mum. I’m saying that Seth truly has zero inclination that today is his birthday and mine. Isn’t that insane? Whatever has happened to our resident workaholic. It has all gone to his head.”

Suki let out a low, dry laugh. “No, dear. I’m afraid the title of resident workaholic was earned by your father years ago. Nothing Seth ever does will compete.”

Sera didn’t look at her mom as she spoke, “Well, you can’t be a resident workaholic if you’re not even a resident.” She had said it with such a humorless tone, that her statement had single-handedly plunged the entire atmosphere into a weary, uncomfortable silence. 

Suki sighed sadly, moving towards her daughter, already rehearsing the words in her head before she spoke them. “Sera, dear-”

Sera moved away from her towards the stairs, without so much as a glance back. “Sorry to pull a Seth-original, but if I don’t bolt right now, I too will be late. And I can’t be late to school today. I have a test that needs to be aced.” with that, she hopped up the stairs and was gone.

Suki was left in the quiet, empty kitchen with a floating, outstretched hand and no one to hold onto. 

Upstairs, Sera was taking out her silent rage in the way she rushed to get ready, doing everything with more force than required, almost knocking several things over and trying hard to not slam the bathroom door as she rushed in and out to fix her hair, brush her teeth, survey her appearance. Her morning routine seemed to go by much faster than usual and she was thankful for it, because then she could get out of this tight and heavy house as fast as possible and finally breathe the horrible, but free air of the streets on her way to school. 

Their father, San, had always been a sour topic around the house. Nobody spoke about him, not because he wasn’t there, but because he would never be, even though he wasn’t dead. You spoke about someone you missed fondly because you could imagine the next time you would see them and how much relief you would feel when you did, how much better things would be when the thing you’ve been wanting finally gets to you. And when someone is dead, you talk about them fondly as well, but because you’re grateful for the time you already had and will never get back, a sort of respect by memory. Well, how do you talk about someone that isn’t dead, but might as well be? Sera had no idea, other than with disdain and spite, if at all. Suki had other opinions, always having something to say in defense of her absent husband. A hard-working soldier, she said, who sent us all the fruit of his hard labour every month. San’s money was what was getting us by everyday. I wonder whether my mother didn’t know that soldiers registered with families always got a portion of their salary sent back home, a portion kept for that soldier himself, and another piece set aside to save. It was why, on the streets, you heard soldiers earned so much money, but when you have that money in your hands, sliced into three, it suddenly didn’t seem like such a lumpy sum anymore. San hadn’t sent us any money himself. The crown did. Suki had to know, but was probably in some sort of denial. Oh, but he sent us letters every month as well, Suki said once. Yes, Sera thought to herself. Letters that could be compared side by side to one another over a year and all the 12 would appear written in one sitting. In his letters, San only ever indicated concern over the same things. That Seth was going about his forced assessment studies as advised, and that Sera was not still trying to live her aimless, stupid pipe dream of becoming a girl-soldier, that her grades in school were as high as the scoresheet allowed. San had stopped mentioning when next he would visit them, stopped asking how they were getting by, stopped trying to keep up with events in the tiny town and all his childhood friends who lived there in his absence. He stopped caring. She had tried to do the same, in all her stubborn nature, and she had failed because she was just so angry. And she couldn’t understand for the life of her why no one else seemed to be. Her mother was in a permanent state of dazed gentleness, seeming more sad and lonely than anything else. Her brother, that otherworldly buffoon, went about his busy days in such a state of normalcy, like absolutely nothing was wrong, and nothing had changed. Seth stayed diligently on the path that San had carved for him and cemented him into, irrespective of all the times it was clear that particular path was far from what was best for him. But Seth didn’t seem to care, even in their father’s absence. So she was left alone, left behind, the only one who still harbored rage for him, who had yet to come to terms and accept her situation and everything that came with it. She was nothing like Seth, and if she was ever going to squeeze herself into the tight lines her father had drawn for her, it would most certainly not be in his absence. Now, spitefully, she would do whatever she wanted, regardless of who supported her. Which is why she’d only be going to school to write the one test, and then head off to the school sparring grounds with Will, who seemed to be the only person in the world who saw her for who she truly was and accepted her that way, even praised her so very often. She would train with him until his free period was over, then he’d hand her over to his friends, who’d take turns fighting her until school came to an end. Then she would come home, in her clean uniform, changed out of any dirty combat clothes, talk briefly about how great her classes were when her mother asked, then head upstairs after a large meal and absolutely collapse on the top bunk until late into the night, when Seth came home, and collapsed right after her. Then she’d rise, like a zombie and do all her day’s homework and more studying, all easy stuff she could afford to halfass pumped up on coffee, and still maintain her stellar grades so steadily, that no one would ask any questions. Once it was all done the best it could be, she’d head back into bed a good time before Seth got up for his own early morning studying, oblivious to it all. Then it was eat, sleep, repeat. Just not in that order. And nobody would suspect a thing, because the ease of living with people who fooled themselves through life was that they would see the things they wanted to see, believe whatever was easier. And Sera had become wonderful at showing her father what he wanted to see for years. She could easily do the same to anyone else. 

So with an unseen determination, Sera jogged downstairs, ready to leave, and lied to her mum again, before rushing out of the house to draw her own lines and carve her own paths, because she was done letting other people do it for her.",1,1744084959.0,writers,1,1.0,False

**Chapter 12**



I follow Doss at a relaxed pace. Blake walks next to me, his gaze on the other men like a hawk. Damien is a step behind us, his gaze only on Doss.

Doss walks into his office, law books lining the walls. Five cushioned chairs sit in front of a large desk. Doss sits behind the desk, his men moving to flank him.

My gaze is drawn to a portrait behind Doss’s head, stating that an Olson Doss had graduated from Harvard law.

And here I thought all lawyers were angels that fought for good.

Ha.

I move to sit down, but Damien holds his hand in front of me, stopping me. He gives me a look, telling me to trust him, so I step back as he walks up to the chairs.

He presses his hands lightly against the cushions of the chairs, looking for something. A memory comes to mind of a movie where a needle had been placed into a chair.

I hate needles.

I look into Doss’s eyes and smile.

Damien finishes up and shrugs at me. I look at him with a newfound respect as I sit down in the chair at the center.

Doss’s chair has him slightly taller than me, making it look like he’s looking down at me. I lift my feet and put them on his desk as I tip the chair onto its back legs. Blake and Damien stay standing behind me, watching the other men with narrowed eyes.

Doss narrows his eyes ever so slightly, then smiles. “I am surprised you got here so soon. How did you find out? I don’t believe my message has even reached Mr. Demor yet.” He motions towards one of his men who walks over to a coffee machine in the corner. “Coffee? Tea?”

Damien catches my gaze and gives the smallest shake of his head.

I raise my eyebrows, who knew he had such a mind for intrigue?

“Nothing for me, thanks.” I say, shifting my gaze to the big boss man. “I was hired to take care of Rose Demor specifically.” The lie comes easily to me. I cross my arms, “Speaking of, I would like to get to the matter at hand.”

“That doesn’t answer my question.”

I give him my sweetest smile. “I didn’t answer your question because I didn’t want to answer your question. Please stop avoiding the question, Doss.”

Doss hums, as one of his men places a cup of coffee in front of him. “You certainly aren’t the person-” He pauses, looking at the two boys with me. “People. You aren’t the people I expected Mr. Demor to send.”

I let out an annoyed breath. “He wanted to surprise you.” I drop my feet from his desk and let the front legs of my chair hit the ground with a *THUMP.* I lean forward, holding his gaze. “Some people might enjoy this little game of wits, Mr. Doss. But I am *very* much not in the mood for it. Get to the point, before I decide it’ll be quicker and safer for Rose to just kill you.” I show him all my teeth.

Doss narrows his eyes, and opens his mouth, only for the sound of the door opening to calm him down. “James, how good of you to show up. I was just speaking to Mr. Demor’s representative.”

I turn to look at the new arrival. He’s a toned muscular man, and he moves with a grace that tells me he is more than just a block of meat. His eyes study me with an interested gaze I do not appreciate. Although, I’m sure he’s used to women appreciating it.

“James here, is the reason why any threat you give me is meaningless.” Doss puts his hand in front of him, and gives me an arrogant smile. “You can tell Mr. Demor that I expect twelve million in my account by six AM tomorrow. If he does that, he might see his daughter the next day. If he doesn’t, well… I can’t take responsibility for what happens to her.”

I close my eyes.

*Is it time?*

*It is.*

Time to get more blood on my hands.

“**\[Stop Right There\]**” I cast the field around Blake and Damien, then I’m leaping out of my chair. I grab the chair as I move, and throw it at one of the men already reaching for their gun. I’m right behind the chair, my hand punching his stomach with enough force to knock the wind out of him. I grab his arm as he falls and throw him into another guard.

Arms wrap around me, so I jump up, letting the back of my head break the third man’s nose. His arms let go and I spin around to grab his head and snap his neck.

Time slows as I watch the man fall to the floor. My heart aches as I look at another man I killed. Another death.

I close my eyes, a mental breath calming myself.

I open my eyes, and cast “**\[Unmatchable Speed\]**”, I appear in front of Doss, the slimy man’s eyes widening.

Suddenly, James is between us. His foot strikes out, sending me sprawling backwards. I manage to keep my feet, but James follows it up with a second flawless kick, faster than I can follow. I block the strike, and cast “**\[Take Your Time\]**”. Time slows to a halt, but James’s foot is still moving. I feel at my psi to find it dangerously low.

I can’t sustain a long fight. I look at the boys from the corner of my eye. My protective field is still in effect, and they are shooting at the guards from behind it. *Guard.* The others are down with bullets in their bodies. Only Doss, James, and that last bodyguard are still alive.

My focus returns to the foot about to hit me. Looking at it closer, there’s an odd glow surrounding his body. He must be using some kind of energy to augment his speed, just like I am. Why is he faster than me then? It doesn’t look like he’s using psi. So maybe mana? Or something else? Hopefully he runs out of whatever it is before I run out of psi.

I lift my hands, barely blocking the foot with my gloves. Then I deactivate my perception ability and time resumes.

His leg hits my arm, but I don’t move, a faint shield appearing between my gloves and his foot. We both stare in shock for a moment, before he throws several more kicks in quick succession. I use as little movement as I can to keep my arms between me and his attacks.

A furious exchange of blows comes from the man, leaving me completely on the defensive as he moves with a speed I can’t match. My psi drains from the movement and holding up the barrier around the boys.

Finally, I fuck up, committing too hard to a feint only for him to step forward and punch me in the gut.

I fall forward, spittle flying from my mouth as I collapse to the ground. Many things inside me are broken.

“I hate to kill such a beautiful girl. But Doss pays me well.” He says, standing over me as my gloves work overtime to heal the damage done.

I spit at him, and force a single word to come out of my mouth. “Creep.”

A kick sends me rolling into the wall and breaking several more of my ribs. “Still, it’s hard to give the finishing blow. Maybe I can restrain you? No, you’re a Beta Tester, aren’t you? If I let you live, it’ll come back to haunt me.” He lifts his foot over my throat.

This is it, isn’t it? Maybe you should stop questioning everything you say, right? And just kill me, maybe?

He starts to press down with his foot, only for more gunshots to ring out.

The man stumbles forward, then turns in anger towards the sound. I grab the opportunity, pulling his leg out from under him. He falls, and I roll on top of him, my hand stabbing into his throat without hesitation. My glove enhances the strike, and I use the last of my psi to cast “**\[Force Of Many Blades\]**”. I refuse to hesitate like he did.

Tears fall down my face as I stare into his dead eyes, but I push my moral conundrums aside and stand up to look at the room. The last guard is dead, Doss lies on the floor moaning in pain. The two boys stand bloodied, but alive.

“Thank you,” I gasp out to the two of them, my throat still healing from the little bit of pressure James had put on it.

I walk over to Doss, the glowing of my gloves lessening as my body heals. “Where. Is. Rose?”

He must’ve seen something in my expression, because he doesn’t argue or go quiet. He simply says, “Second floor, room 203. My men are guarding her, but I can get them to-”

I don’t wait for him to finish as I grab a gun from a surprised Damien, “I’m sorry” I say as I pull the trigger.

I hand the gun back to Damien, who takes it with a shaking hand.

“Monsters are so much easier to kill.” I say, my voice nearly breaking. I step over the dead bodies and ignore the blue window that pops up. “Come on, we have a girl to rescue.” I finish as I walk out the door.

On the other side, I pause to lean against the wall. Tears flow down my face. I had hoped it would be easier this time. At the same time, I’m glad it wasn’t. I don’t want there to be a time where tears don’t flow for the dead.

I fall to my knees, close my eyes and say a prayer for every dead man in that room.

 

\*\*\*

 

I push myself off the ground, as the two boys leave the room. Damien is quiet, his gaze in the distance as he deals with the deaths of those men in his own way. Blake looks like he wants to say something, but decides to stay quiet.

“Give me a minute, and then we’ll go down.” I say. Then I turn my attention to my psi. I watch it regain its energy.

“I was not expecting the day to turn out like this.” Blake says.

“I don’t think any of us were.” I respond.

When my psi is about halfway recovered, I open my eyes and motion for the two of them to follow me.

I walk towards the stairwell at an even pace. Damien follows silently, while Blake hesitates for a split second before hurrying to catch up.

“Elena, I’m worried.” Blake says, and something in his voice brings my attention to him. “You and Damien are taking this so hard, but I… I just feel numb, like my feelings were flipped off. This might sound ridiculous, but am… am I a monster?”

I stop, causing the two boys to halt as well. “I don’t think you are. The fact that you are so worried about the answer to that question proves you aren’t.” I pull him into a hug. “Everybody deals with death in their own way. And that’s okay.” I let him go. “Are you ready for what comes next?”

He nods, some of the tenseness leaving him.

I give him a small smile, then open the door to the stairs. We make our way to the second level. I prepare my spells, then look at both boys, before throwing open the doors.

The fight is a quick one, as we catch the men by surprise and they don’t have a Beta Tester with them.

I look at the dead men, then after a moment, cast **\[Defence Of The Earth\]** to cover the men from sight with a dome of earth.

I walk over to room 203. It’s locked, so I pull my hand back, and punch through the lock.

The girl in the corner huddles away from the sound but doesn’t look up. Pink hair is all I see, as she rests her head on a pair of scraped knees, her arms and legs tied to a pole in front of her.

I softly walk over to her, then in a quiet voice say “One of these days, we are going to have a proper date.”

She looks up at me, her makeup in streaks from crying. Blake hands me a knife, and she looks between the two of us in shock.

“Elena? Blake? What are you doing here?” She asks, her voice raw.

“Coming to rescue you of course.” I cut through the ropes holding her wrists and her legs. It’s a sharp knife, and does the job easily.

She lunges forward, her arms wrapping around me and she sobs into my shoulder. I wrap my arms around her, and hold her for a while. The soft glow of my gloves tells me that they’re healing the scratches and bruises on her body.

Eventually she calms down enough to pull away. I sit her down, pull out a napkin from my pocket, and gently wipe at the streaked makeup.

“Thank you.” She says quietly.

“I don’t like it when my makeup smears either.” I answer.

“No.” She rests her head in the hand wiping her face, “Thank you for coming for me.”

“Always.” I say. I reach up with my other hand to wipe some hair away from her face. “I happen to really like you, you know?”

She looks into my eyes, then nods. “Yeah, I think I do.”

The clearing of a throat behind me pulls our attention up to Damien. “We should leave, we don’t know who else might show up.”

I nod. I help Rose up and she leans heavily on me. We make our way out of the room, and her gaze stays on the dome of earth in the middle of the hallway.

“What happened?” She asks.

“Death.” I answer.

She looks at me puzzledly as I guide her past the rock and to the elevator.

I don’t want to make her walk down the stairs.

Her gaze finally lands on Damien, who gives a small wave. “We haven’t met, what’s your name?”

“I’m Damien. A friend of Blake’s, and maybe Elena’s?”

“Of course you are.” I say.

The elevator dings down to the first level, and I prepare my defensive spells.

The two receptionists stare at us as we walk out. All of us are covered in blood, and Rose is still leaning on me heavily.

I wave to them. “We worked things out with Doss. He should be contacting you soon.”

They don’t respond, but continue to stare as we make our way out the automatic doors of the exit.

“What happened to Doss?” Rose asks as we make our way to the car. I guide her into the back seat, then sit next to her.

“He’s dead.” I say, my gaze turning back to her. “Where should we take you Rose?”

“Can I come to your house? I need you.” Rose seems to realize what she said a second later and looks away from my gaze.

I reach up and start running my hand through her hair. “Of course you can. What about your dad?”

“I’ll call him when we get there.” She mumbles, her eyes closing as she leans into me. Her breathing evens out after a few moments and I suspect that she fell asleep.

“Do you still need to visit your cousin?” I ask Damien.

“I don’t think I will. It’s late. Can you take me home after you drop them off?” He asks Blake.

Blake nods, his gaze staying on the road.

Damien pauses, his eyes looking at the dashboard in front of him. “Elena?”

“Yeah?”

“I know this sounds a little weird, but can I have your phone number? After all we’ve been through… it just feels weird not having it.” He rubs the back of his neck, his eyes downward.

“Sure.” I say. I hold my hand out, and he gives me his phone.

I type in my number, and he texts me.

Then we are left in silence again.

I look down, noticing that Rose is still wearing the bracelet I’d given her.

I nuzzle her hair with my nose, and she snuggles in closer.

“Sweet dreams.” I whisper.

The Gamemakers in the arena: I want to go over why I think they’re there, who they are, and what they’re doing.

Why are they there? Haymitch has damaged the arena somehow. We don’t know how badly, but we know things started going haywire after he did it. It’s likely that they’re there to deal with some sort of technical difficulty or a mutt release that didn’t go well? (there’s ladders leading to the water tanks in the first place, which might indicate that the Capitol planned on doing regular maintenance from the beginning).
Why are they doing? The tributes are chasing each other, the Capitol likely sees that as a good time to do maintenance because the tributes are occupied with each other. 

Who are they? Interns. Idk that for sure, but they definitely give off that vibe. Think “law intern that has to go run coffee for the higher ups”. They’re doing the grunt work. Haymitch thinks they’re around the tributes’ age even, which tells us they’re young. At one point one of them tries to stand up to the tributes and tells them to leave, but Maysilee points out that they’re, “shaking like a leaf.” So these are Gamemaker grunts who got forced into doing the dirty, dangerous work. 

Remember that the Capitol is arrogant, and always views the districts as animals. The Capitol overestimates its power many times throughout the series. This is one of those times. And we know that Snow isn’t above putting teenagers in dangerous situations in the first place, so the entire Capitol doesn’t really have a problem with some interns doing HG grunt work. 

Why is this scene important? The districts stop fighting each other for a moment and team up to fight the Capitol. Maysilee and Maritte both kill the Gamemakers at the same time, and Maysilee even makes a comment that they should probably be on the same side. But, for a moment, the districts were united in the same hatred for the Gamemakers and what they represent. The seeds of the rebellion were there.

And Haymitch froze at the time. I think you can interpret why he did in many different ways. But it speaks to the fact that rebellion was always present, just waiting for the districts to catch up and realize that they would be stronger together. I think it follows the Newcomers theme quite well too. 

There’s probably more I could say but this post is way too long already. And of course I might be totally wrong on a lot of this, but I loved the scene! I think there’s a few different ways to interpret it, but this is mainly what I got out of it.

We also have 4 kiosks for self-service. There were a few people ordering there. It was busy time, about 6:10.

The phone starts ringing, and I am taking the order of a lovely, sweet older woman. I am not going to walk away from her to answer the phone, most associates never answer it cause they usually want to speak to a manager anyways, and it was 6:10, so this person on the phone FOR SURE got the recording saying that ""because we are busy during these times, try to call back."" It keeps ringing. 

Suddenly, some older guy (not super old, certainly competent enough that he SHOULD be able to push buttons on a screen to order,) starts SCREAMING, ""Answer the PHONE! I need help over here!!!!"" I look up pretty gobsmacked...he's holding his phone and waving at me like a lunatic. Everyone ordering, pretty much everyone in the whole place looks at him.

My old lady turns around and says, ""who is he?!"" Like we were all thrown at his tone and generally insane behavior. 

""umm sir, you will have to give me a minute as I am taking an order."" In the snottiest voice I could manage. 
""And you guys are the only people here? Who is supposed to answer the phone?!"" 
""That would be me, SIR, but as you can see, we are all busy.""

I dragged out this lady's order for as long as I FUCKING could, but eventually I had to go see what his SUPER IMPROTAINT issue was. 

""The stupid kiosk won't let me order a decaf coffee."" (Ya for sure...the KIOSK is stupid.) I said, ""you don't have to specify what type of coffee...just order the size and get whatever coffee you want."" 

""Oh well why doesn't it tell me that?!"" (I mean, I'm not really sure what he imagined what we were going to do to, based on the coffee being self serve and less that four feet away from him...)

He continued to argue and bitch to anyone who would listen that his bagels weren't sliced or toasted (he didn't order them that way) that the cream cheese was WAY too small, (again, he ordered indivual 1 oz instead of a tub) and even the fact that we didn't give him a handle bag cause he TORE through his smaller bag making sure we didn't miss anything. 

I didn't want to look at his dumb face anymore, I went to help production. My cashier came to me 10 minutes later and said that someone wanted to talk to me. I'm like PLEASE, NO MORE OF THIS GUY!!!! But it was the sweet old lady that I was helping! She heard and saw it all, and she tucked a $5 bill in my hand and said, ""I was a waitress for many years. I worked at Bob Evans and I dealt with jerks like him all the time.  Don't waste a second thinking about that asshole.""

So an asshole to a redemption! I haven't given up on everyone yet!!!

I am in the trenches of (human child) motherhood right now. I have a 2 year old and a 4 year old, and they are the best, but they act like what I imagine a puppy acts like. It’s rare that I get to sleep through the night. They are constantly running around being crazy, getting into things I’d rather they didn’t, my 2 year old is potty training and I am pretty regularly cleaning up accidents, and they are constantly right there beside me needing my attention. It’s totally fine. I’m rolling with it and I don’t get worked up over any of it anymore. When I first had my oldest child? Woah. Talk about baby blues and wondering what the fuck I had gotten myself into. He completely upended my life in the way that only mothers can truly understand. But we made it through, and it was much easier when I had my youngest because I knew that the newborn stage passes and to expect difficulty and that it’s really not the end of the world when something isn’t perfect or even when something is miserable because it’s all temporary. 

We are getting a puppy. People talk about puppy blues. Are there any other mothers here who have gotten a puppy while still in the trenches? I just feel like cleaning up a few more puddles on my floor, waking up in the night to tend to a tiny needy little thing like I already have been for 4 years, and having one more thing depend on me and want my attention isn’t going to throw me for that much of a loop. Oh, you chewed up the coffee table? Joke’s on you! My 4 year old put a bunch of dents in it last year when he smashed his monster truck toy into it repeatedly, and we’re just waiting to replace it until the kids are older. You shit on the floor? That’s okay. I already have the enzymatic cleaner and paper towels out because my 2 year old did the same thing! Biting? Both of my human children went through that stage too- it passes. You want to walk right in between my legs and jump on me while I’m trying to make dinner? You want to follow me to the bathroom every time I have to go? You are begging me to take you outside to run around even though we just came back in? Welcome to the club! Nobody in this house leaves me alone, ever. (And I wouldn’t have it any other way). 

Anyway, I feel like I’m immune to the puppy blues because I am already there and have been for years. Am I wrong? Am I about to be severely humbled? I need other parents to chime in please! Or if you’re not a parent, but you have an opinion, I’d love to hear from you too.

I am all the dating apps, and have been told I am handsome several times. But for one reason or another I can never seem to a girl who wants to actually meet up for a date. I feel like the problem is, the female has countless other matches and she just picks the best one. Which is apparently not me. Other  times I wonder how many of these girls have boyfriends or husband's and just want to feel good about themselves. The girls I match with are by no means super model's they're attractive but not super hot. Even if we have a lot in common they usually ghost me when I ask if they're interested in a date. Here's what usually happens. 


1. I ask about meeting up at a restaurant or coffee whatever. She ceases to exist, the account is updated with new pictures. But I'll never hear from her again. 

2. They make up some excuse about why said Day won't work. Then they unmatch, or again stop talking to me. 


3. They say they'd be interested in that, and again they cease to exist. It happens constantly. 


I like meeting people the old fashioned way, but meeting a girl in real life I find she already has a boyfriend or she's married. Because obviously the women I meet in real life aren't on a dating app. Then they aren't interested in me anyway. I use to think dating apps at least let you meet/talk to people who found you attractive. So you had a leg up verses trying date someone you met in real life. But It really starts to hurt your confidence and self esteem after awhile. Am I doing something wrong? Or I am just an option, to these women? ",2,1744083704.0,dating_advice,8,0.75,False
1ju4fav,https://i.redd.it/mqgunfdt7jte1.jpeg,"INSEAD Campus, Croissant and Some Hot Coffee","There’s something magical about sipping hot coffee and biting into a buttery croissant near the INSEAD campus. The air feels different, ambitious, yet calm. Sitting there one morning, I couldn’t help but reflect on how far I’d come. 

Okay since I’ve been getting a lot of DMs asking about my GMAT score, profile, what schools I applied to, and how I worked on profile enhancement, here’s the full story.

I have already spoken about my profile in several platforms but as there are too many DMs asking for the same i am just adding this to my story : When I got a 630 on the GMAT (Classic edition), I’ll be honest I felt crushed. ISB was my dream, and INSEAD was the stretch goal. But with that score, it felt like the doors to both had slammed shut. I almost gave up. But then I asked myself what if I stopped fixating on the score and started playing to my strengths instead? That one mindset shift changed everything. I’m a mechanical engineer from VTU with a 7.8 CGPA and 3.5 years at L&T, where I led multiple cost-saving process improvements and was even awarded the Rising Star Award. I had mentored underprivileged students and led waste management drives, but my efforts were scattered and lacked narrative structure. So I got help and followed a clear plan. Over 2 months, I went all-in on profile enhancement, picked up 3 new social impact initiatives, summer school programs, got involved in 6 extracurriculars, and reframed every experience using the STAR framework (Last year March/April and May). Then came 3 intense months of application work (June/July and August): refining essays, aligning my goals with each school’s vision, choosing the right recommenders, and optimizing my LinkedIn to reflect my journey. Slowly, things started to click. What once looked like a weak profile became a story of resilience, leadership, and real impact. I applied to ISB in Round 1, and when that admit hit my inbox, it felt surreal. And just when I thought it couldn’t get better, I received an admit to INSEAD without retaking the GMAT as part of their January intake. From someone who once thought 630 was the end of the road, to someone now joining two of the world’s top B-schools, I’ve learned this: it’s not about the score it’s about how you play your hand. With the right structure, strategy, and story, you can absolutely turn things around

i'm also going on vacation next week and would love to indulge in a glass of wine but i'm nervous after seeing the effects that coffee had on me.

A few weeks ago, my fiance and I found out the gender, and he was really excited to share the news with his parents. I’d explained to both my fiance and his parents at the time that I wanted to wait before telling my own parents we were expecting again, as my grandfather had just passed away and my mum wasn’t in the right mindset to handle big news. We had the funeral last week and she was doing a bit better, and we wanted to tell them in person. They seemed to understand. 

Fast forward to last weekend—my parents came over to watch our eldest’s soccer game (significant as they've only visited maybe 5 times, and never seen our son play), and I’d baked pink cupcakes to announce the pregnancy in a private, meaningful way over coffee afterwards. My in-laws have a habit of dropping by unannounced, and they ended up being there too. My fiance had told them the night before about our plans to share our news with my parents and had asked them specifically to keep quiet about it.

So while we were watching the game, my FIL loudly calls out to me “So how’s baby #3 going?” right in front of my parents. I gave him a look of ""WTF??"" and he clapped a hand over his mouth. My parents didn’t really react in the moment and just stared straight ahead at the game, and I thought (hoped) they hadn’t heard because of the noise. Everyone acted like nothing had happened, and I didn’t know how to respond. 

Later, during coffee, I brought out the cupcakes and said, “Well, I think the secret’s out now.” My dad said, “Yeah, we caught that before.” Their reaction was supportive but very low-key, in their usual aloof way. They don't do ""excited"" at the best of times but this was different. I tried explaining why we’d waited to tell them, but I couldn’t help feeling that they were offended my in-laws knew weeks earlier.

I’m so angry at my father-in-law for overstepping like this. He did apologise, and I brushed it off, but I’m still furious. It's like he thinks it was just a cute silly ""oops"" moment but I'm over it. This moment was supposed to help bridge the gap in my already tense and distant relationship with my parents, and instead, it feels like it’s done more damage. My parents haven’t called since (it’s been 4 days), and I don’t feel like bringing it up with them again.

1ju46w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1ju46w9/interview_tips_that_helped_me_stand_outverified/,Interview tips that helped me stand out(verified by recruiters),"Since I started searching for internships in college and even after working full-time for a while, I’ve gone through nearly hundreds of interviews. I summarized some of the tricks I used during interviews and applied them consistently in the end. One of my recruiters even said that my performance and communication style impressed him, which proved that these methods were super useful. Here are my tricks that helped me improve my prep quality:

**Start with small talk**: It helps me relax and get into the right mindset and it leaves HR with a friendly impression. I usually start by asking where they are and how the weather is, and what I’ve been up to recently.

**Use the Q&A session to sell myself again**: I usually say something like: ""I know this is a very competitive position. I’d love to know what qualities you value most in a candidate."" Based on the HR’s answer, I will summarize and highlight my strengths again to reinforce my impression. I also proactively ask about the next steps to express my strong interest in the role.

**Research HR in advance**: Before interviews, I usually search for the HR’s profile on LinkedIn to prepare targeted questions for the Q&A session and show my interest. If I notice they’ve been with the company for a long time, I’ll casually mention it: ""I noticed you’ve been with the company for quite a while, which shows great commitment. Could you share what you like most about working here?""

**Make your experience audience-friendly**: Most HR don't have tech background, so it’s important to explain my work in a way they can understand. I generally write out my example and let ChatGPT rephrase it to be friendly for non-technical audiences.

**Connect with alumni from the company as soon as you get the interview**: This is the most efficient way to quickly learn about the company. When connecting with alumni, don’t immediately jump into asking for a coffee chat, ask them about the interview process and what they like most about working at the company.

**Show your understanding of the company during the interview**:Let the HR or hiring manager know that you’ve done your homework for this interview. Prepare an example in advance that strongly connects the company’s culture, outlook, or business with your personality or experience.

**Prepare a work sample related to the company**: It’s a good chance to showcase your execution skills and capabilities. Make the HR or hiring manager feel valued and respected.

**Maximize free resources**: Generate answers tailored to my resumes, questions, and specific roles: [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/); Question prediction based on job roles and real question banks: [AMA Interview](https://www.amainterview.ai/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=Reddit+Post&utm_campaign=AMA+AI); Practice for coding interviews and system design: [Educative](https://www.educative.io/); Data techniques, the latest reports, and supplemental learning: [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)",2,1744082865.0,GetEmployed,1,1.0,False

1ju46k7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ju46k7/i_can_feel_a_spiral_coming_on/,I can feel a spiral coming on,"Today was supposed to be a productive day. I had the day off and everyone else was gone on a trip so I had the house to myself. I was going to get my laundry done, clean my bird's cage, meal prep burritos for the week, clean my bathroom. I didn't do any of that, I did make myself breakfast, but by the time lunch came around I remembered I had an instant burger button on my phone. I scrolled from basically the time I woke up to right now at 9:42pm. I am familiar with this feeling, I just hope it doesn't evolve into a months long depression cycle with weeks in between showers.

I know what it is. It's the phone and the weed. I know it's my fault. I know I can just not smoke. I know I can put the damn phone down. But these things bring me comfort just as well as they make me miserable. When I'm on the internet I feel connected, like I know what's going on. When I'm deep in my phone, putting it down makes me feel lonely and anxious. Suddenly I realize I'm 21, not enrolled in college, working a minimum wage job, maintaining a dwindling number of friendships with people I still know from high school, only go out once every couple months, and I become painfully aware that I won't be young forever and I've already wasted a good portion of my life on the internet instead of having experiences.

I can't remember the last time I went more than a couple weeks without smoking. I usually have a bowl alongside my morning coffee and keep my buzz going all day from there. I don't even get high anymore, I just become numb. It's uncomfortable being so aware when I'm completely sober. Aware of all my surroundings, my thoughts, how different materials feel on my skin. It's like weed puts a fog in my brain. I'm aware of fewer things, I can only hold so many thoughts in my head at once, and only for so long. I can feel the constant use making me dumber. I used to be far more eloquent. My English teachers used to praise me for having such a firm command of the English language. In contrast to today where it's taken me half an hour to write what you've read so far.

Again, I know these things are my fault. I know I have the power to fix them with a bit of willpower, but I am bad at maintaining healthy habits. I had been improving until recently. I was still smoking every day, but I wasn't on social media as much and made more of an effort to be healthy with my diet and responsible with my money. I just couldn't keep it up. The allure of the misery rectangle was too enticing.

On top of this, I still don't have my driver's license. I begged my mom to teach me how to drive when I was in highschool but she was too scared to get behind the wheel with me. I asked her to take me out to an empty field or parking lot or something just to get the hang of how a vehicle handles and she never did. I took a driver's ed course my senior year but, I went to a shit school my senior year and didn't learn anything. Even if I did I wouldn't be confident getting on the road  only having passed a paper test. I still resent my mom for this a little. I've always been so anxious and scared of the world, and I feel like most of the time I just needed someone I trusted to show me it wasn't that bad. Come to think of it I can't think of that many skills I learned from having been taught by my parents. My father was intellectually disabled, addicted to drugs, and was kicked out of the house by the time I was twelve. My mother spent most of her energy on my sister, who has every mental disorder under the sun. Sometimes I genuinely feel like I'm a little socially underdeveloeped because growing up she never shut the fuck up long enough to let me finish a sentence. Now I feel like a handicapped adult with no chance of making anything of my life before I turn 30. I don't even have a real bank account. I do everythihg through cash app.

This went a little off the rails, and I know it's a lot of bitching. I didn't have the worst life growing up. I had food and water and I went to school. I just feel so unprepared and trapped. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I don't have realistic prospects for what I *can* do.

My SIL is good but she’s also Bi-Polar and has definitely had her challenges over the years. At one point she was hospitalized for nearly 4 months. My niece has ALWAYS been very independent and intense, even as a baby and toddler (she gets it from her dad and frankly that whole side of the family). For all those reasons she was forced to grow up fast in a lot of respects. 

My niece got really into wrestling competitively this past year. Her slightly older cousin (not my kid) even ranked pretty high as a sophomore at state this year. They live in different areas of the state and her mom is a nurse, I’m 1000% positive my niece didn’t pick this up from her cousin. 

I noticed earlier this year how much my niece was talking about making weight and doing cuts. I get that that part is typical (though still borderline eating disorder in my book) for wrestlers. What’s ended up concerning me is wrestling season ended a few weeks ago, there aren’t any meets and hardly any practices now, and I don’t hear talks about “making weight” but she did proudly announce to me at dinner last night that she’d dropped 5 lbs. Then after eating dinner (I don’t notice stuffing herself but there was 11 of us at the table) she gets up and announces that she had to go throw up now. Neither of her parents batted and eye and the whole family acted like that was normal. 

My sister and I were both taught how to be bulimic growing up by our respective teachers/coaches (ballet and swimming) so part of me wonders if I’m reading too much into this. I tried talking to my husband about it and he just said it’s just one more way he’s niece is being intense and she’ll be over it by summer when she’s not in practice at all. 

Idk… I feel like it’s different for girls/women and that wrestling was just the gateway/trigger for her. 

If my husband doesn’t see it I doubt my BIL will. I always worry about bringing something this big to my SIL, I don’t want to trigger an episode. Not doing anything just doesn’t sit right with me. Should I take my niece out for a coffee or something? What do I say? Should I involve her aunt that’s a nurse? Are there any mandatory reporting laws regarding this when it comes to minors?

1ju42wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1ju42wh/bdp_sister_controlling_family_time/,BDP Sister Controlling Family Time,"
My BPD younger sister and I (both in our 30s) were best friends growing up. She was so fun and full of life and I was grounding for her when she got a little out of control or needed advice. We had a blast together and laughed all the time. We grew up on a farm and played with animals and in nature together, always exploring. Sometimes her extreme emotions scared me and at times it did get dark. But I always thought her impulsive behavior would tone down as an adult. Instead, it became more destructive (binge drinking and getting into risky situations, abusing prescription drugs, accusing entire family of imagined abuse and trauma that did not occur, running away, threatening suicide, cutting ties with me and other family members for months and then returning, etc). It has been years since the more extreme incidents mentioned have occurred but everyone still walks on egg shells around her and my parents still take care of her often (financially, buying things she needs, running to her rescue when called) even though she is an adult. Growing up I felt very protective of her and wanted to always be there when she got into trouble. I felt it was my job - like my purpose in life was to always be there if needed because I was her only sibling. By my mid 20s, after a particularly terrifying rough patch for her, I finally realized that I could not protect her from herself and that I had to distance myself for my own well being and life goals.

I am in my 30s now and I live far away from my family. I make a trip to see them a couple times a year. I have a great relationship with my parents and grandparents and miss them very much, especially now that they are getting older. I am coming to terms with the fact that my job and lifestyle will probably mean living long distance from them even though it is very sad and I miss them often. So I try to stay in touch frequently and plan meaningful visits. The problem is, when I do get to visit home, my sister goes out of her way to spend every moment with me and I get almost zero alone time with my other family members.

She is high functioning BPD now - steady job, partner, lots of friends. But her family dynamic is very controlling and stressful for me. She insists on joining every meal, coffee, and outing that I plan with other people and never leaves me alone when I am home, especially if I have plans to spend time with other family members. 

My family accommodates this to avoid her feeling left out or getting angry. They also like to be all together but can’t see that this is hard for me. I’ve tried everything to get time alone with my parents or grandparents but aside from random times when she is working or sleeping and I can squeeze in a conversation with one of my parents, she is always there. I even tried buying tickets for my father and I to see a concert once, but they bought two more so my mom and her could join. She won’t even go to bed until I go to bed.

I know she is just excited to see me, and I could see how this could be normal or fine with some siblings, but with us, it prevents me from connecting with others. When I am trying to catch up and bond with my parents or grandparents, she dominates all conversations. When she’s not performing or telling animated stories, she’s storming into the room to get everyone’s attention because she needs urgent help with something (“I’m bleeding, I’m feeling very sick, I’ve broken something, I’m panicking about work” etc etc). It’s always her show. Sometimes she starts acting like a little kid trying to get attention by literally singing and dancing around. If she’s not getting her way, she starts a fight or walks around pouting and frustrated, banging things around and leaves everyone with a pit in their stomach. 

At the end of every visit, I am utterly exhausted and feel that I didn’t even get quality time with my other relatives. It’s devastating to me to miss deeper conversations and bonding time and it makes me feel isolated and lonely. I end up flying back at the end of a visit and crying to my partner about how homesick I am and how it feels like my sister controls my time and life when I am back home. As childish as it seems, I also have noticed in recent years that I am starting to feel jealous of my sister’s relationships with my family and cousins. Many of them do not see her intense side and only see her charming and extroverted side. She is beloved by many of them and I am left feeling crazy, like I am imagining everything and overreacting. It makes me sad because I did not feel like this as children. I miss our friendship. I was always proud of her and protective of her. But since her more destructive adulthood years shook my life, I have become afraid of her, devastated at the thought that I have lost our sisterly bond, and angry that she treated everyone so badly and gets to be close with my family while I am left on the outside.

I, too began this protocol in 2020. I took a break from 23-present, and am beginning again.

I wonder if there would be a complication (or benefit) from having a coffee enema each morning while on the LGB protocol. (The five days of no fats/oils while intaking the malic acid). 

Thank you, ahead of time for any insight.

1ju407b,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1ju407b/ozempic_gave_me_silent_gerd/,Ozempic gave me silent gerd,"I took ozempic last year for about 2/3 months to slim down for summer. The burps and nausea were “normal” side effects I brushed off. I looked great lost 20 pounds and at the time was so thankful for it. 

Once I stopped tho the burping continued. A month went by and it continued and by then all medicine would have been out of my system.

I frequently drank lattes on my empty stomach while on ozempic and after I came off which made it worse. Chocolate too but the turning point for me was eating bone marrow and I got so nauseous I almost threw up. 

My symptoms are burping mostly, lump in my throat sometimes, sharp pain in my ribs/shoulders after eating, liquids coming back up but not burning, and I didn’t notice until now but my thought is a bit sore too. When I was in the thick of it I was nauseous too and my hunger cues were off.

I have tried avoiding acidic foods especially coffee, and started my days with kefir or bone broth which both really seem to help but it’s been weeks even months and it’s not 100% better. I also make ginger shots with coconut water and eat a fairly Whole Foods diet (buckwheat, berries, steak, eggs, avocado) 

I recently got prescribed 20 milligrams of omeprazole from my pcp but I’m nervous to take them bc of side effects.

After reading other stories, I am convinced my case of Gerd is rather mild. And when I avoid triggers, and eat bone broth/ kefir my symptoms are very mild but just haven’t gotten  100% better yet. As soon as I have a coffee I’m right back. 

Should I take the ppis? Could a week be enough before I wean off them? The doctor gave me 45 day supply. But she told me that I can stop taking them if I’d seen no change after two weeks. And she gave me very little instruction with them…. I’m doing all the research I can before I take them tomorrow morning 

At this point I’m desperate to go back to normal but don’t want negative symptoms of withdrawals. 

Any thoughts?

At NASA, a flustered intern accidentally opened a Zoom call with the Sun. A giant, flaming orb appeared on the screen, wrapped in a blanket and wearing sunglasses.

“I told you,” the Sun croaked, “I’m burnt out.”

The Earth’s chief climate officer blinked. “You can’t just... take the day off. You're the Sun!”

“Try radiating 24/7 for 4.6 billion years and tell me you don’t need a break,” it wheezed.

Back on Earth, chaos erupted. Solar panels sulked. Mornings were ruined. A group of Australians held a candle-lit protest chanting, *“We want tan lines!”*

1ju3xt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1ju3xt9/my_thoughts_on_banning_phones_in_school_as/,"My thoughts on banning phones in school, as someone seeing the effects firsthand","Heya! My high school (upstate NYS) has been enforcing a half-ban policy. I'd like to share my thoughts!  

The policy:

You're supposed to put your phone into your holding pouch whenever you're in class, and you get it back at the end of the block. I think there have been fewer people on their phones! But most of that is just greater pressure from teachers. There's a sense that looking at your phone is a worse act than reading yaoi on your chromebook or whatever, so people don't look at their phones and are generally more focused.  
  
Personally, I don't put my phone up there because I'd forget half the time and have to run back X3. Nobody's going to give you a pat-down or anything, they just don't want you on your phone.  
  
Even then, in the classes where kids and/or the teacher don't really care it's not really enforced. I was in a ""career and financial management class"" for the first half of this year. Half the time you could look around the room and every single kid there would be on their phones. It really depends on the classroom. Also! most classes will let you grab your phones for a couple minutes at the end if they finish before the period ends.

My personal opinions:

My goal is to get an education in France for 3D modeling for both personal and geopolitical reasons. I have neither a French nor a 3D modeling class, the former because it was canceled this year for lack of students, and the latter because it does not exist. Having my phone, and being able to text in French is a key part of my learning habits, and it would be very strange to sacrifice that in exchange for, what, me being 2% more focused in a class I already get an A in? 

Also, some class are just second screen content. Your level of knowledge is above that of what's being taught, or it's just not something you're going to retain at all by the time you're going to use it (like with said career and financial management class!) Wasting people's time on super strictly enforcing phone use for these classes misses the reason people go on their phones! They do so because they're bored, and what they're doing does not matter.

A complete phone ban would be a real pain! I also like to spend time studying French during study halls, so, I guess that's going to get a little trickier. I'll have to swap back to audiobooks during lunch, which might not be the worst option. 

I think Atrioc's statement about school laptops worsening learning is pretty out of touch, but it's understandable for an elderly person like him. Slop assignments (watch this 3 minute video and write 15 facts about it!) Are bad no matter what medium they come on, and the laptops are usually pretty helpful.

They're extremely limited though. A chromebook can edit text files, run audio files, run google chrome, and literally NOTHING else. Most people sincerely invested in tech think they should actually be less restricted and more powerful, especially as we keep seeing all these stories about 20 year olds who don't understand how to use the file system on their computer.

Something strange and universally disliked that NYS did was they blocked youtube.com! However, since half the time the homework is ""watch this youtube video and take notes"" they had to let you watch youtube through embeds. I had fun making a fake version of youtube with an embed I control which lets me circumvent the restriction. Thankfully, a text editor is more than enough to write html!

I should counternote that don't use any social media (except for, I guess youtube?) and I have my own website. [https://professional-ameteur.neocities.org](https://professional-ameteur.neocities.org) I don't think my phone usage represents the median, most people are using tiktok/instagram/snapchat and not playing *Solatorobo: Red the Hunter* in French. 

Sorry if this is poorly organized. Also! I understand atrioc's position, and respect him, even if I disagree. Sorry for calling you elderly X3. I'll add more if anything important comes to me. Hang on, almost forgot, here's a coffee cow for the trouble:

I was waiting for Jake, my childhood friend, who had always been more than just a companion. We had shared countless adventures, from building treehouses to late-night talks about our dreams. But as we grew older, something shifted. My feelings for him deepened, transforming from an innocent friendship into something more profound. As I watched the sun dip below the horizon, I felt a familiar flutter in my chest. Jake arrived, his warm smile instantly brightening my mood. We chatted about mundane things, but beneath the surface, I could feel the weight of my unspoken feelings pressing down on me. I wanted to tell him how I felt, but fear held me back. What if it ruined our friendship? What if he didn’t feel the same way? That night, I found myself scrolling through Reddit, seeking advice from strangers who might understand my dilemma. I write a letter, pouring my heart out. “I’ve been friends with this guy for years, and I think I’m in love with him. How do I tell him without ruining our friendship?” I hit submit, my heart racing as I awaited responses. The replies flooded in, each one offering a mix of encouragement and caution. “Be honest, but choose the right moment,” one user advised. Another suggested, “Maybe start by hinting at your feelings and see how he reacts.” I felt a sense of relief knowing I wasn’t alone in this struggle. Days passed, and I gathered my courage. I invited Jake for coffee at our favorite café, a place filled with laughter and memories. As we sipped our drinks, I could feel the tension building. Finally, I took a deep breath and said, “Jake, there’s something I need to tell you.”His eyes widened, and I could see curiosity mixed with concern. “What is it?” he asked, leaning in closer.“I’ve been feeling something more than friendship for a while now,” I confessed, my voice trembling. “I care about you deeply, and I just needed you to know.”For a moment, silence enveloped us. My heart raced as I awaited his response, fearing the worst. But then, a smile broke across his face. “I’m so glad you told me,” he said softly. “I’ve been feeling the same way but didn’t know how to say it.” At that moment, the weight lifted, and the air felt lighter. We laughed, relief washing over us as we realized our friendship had evolved into something beautiful. The unspoken words had finally found their voice, and I knew that whatever happened next, we would face it together.",0,1744082008.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

I have to admit, part of your charm, for me, is never quite being sure whether your casual intimacy is intended to spark things in me, or you're just… a divine little sweetheart.

You told me once that on the weekends, sometimes you like to lounge around in bed until your hips hurt.

And I think about that, probably *far* more than I really should…

Lying around with you… you in a silk nightie, me in some boxers and a tee…

Oh, that nightie could slip over your head *so easily*, but we're not going there, not today…

Instead, just…

Cuddling.

Laughing.

Maybe some kisses.

Maybe a little dozing.

Just… enjoying each other. In the comfort of *our* bed, in *our* room, in *our* home.

The sleek, sly little fox… curled up in all her blankets…

The bear, wrapped around her. Warmth. Safety. A paw, resting lightly on one of those legs…

And, sure… when those beautiful hips start aching… then we can get up. Go sip some coffee on the porch. Back in our human forms, back how we show ourselves to the world.

But the fox is still there, always… laughing.

And the bear, tender and sweet, but never far from a gruff ""Hm.""

## Why Replace Parts Rather of the Whole Appliance?

Before diving into the specifics, let's address the core question: Why bother with **Cuisinart parts replacement** at all? There are several compelling reasons:

*   **Cost Savings:** Replacing a single part is substantially cheaper than buying a brand-new appliance. This is especially true for high-end Cuisinart models.
*   **Sustainability:** Repairing rather of replacing contributes to a more enduring lifestyle by reducing e-waste.
*   **Familiarity and Comfort:** You're already familiar with your Cuisinart appliance. Why relearn a new model when a simple part replacement can keep what you know and love running?
*   **Extending Appliance Lifespan:** Regular maintenance and timely parts replacement can significantly extend the lifespan of your Cuisinart appliances.*   **Avoiding Discontinued Models:** Sometimes a particular model that you enjoy is discontinued, making parts replacement the only way to keep using it.

## Identifying Your Cuisinart Appliance and the Required Part

The first crucial step in the **Cuisinart parts replacement** journey is accurately identifying your appliance model and the specific part you need. This prevents ordering errors and ensures a perfect fit. Here's how:

1.  **Locate the Model Number:** The model number is typically found on a sticker or plate located on the bottom or back of the appliance. It might also be inside a compartment, like the battery compartment.Note this number down carefully.
2.  **Consult Your User Manual:** Your Cuisinart user manual may list the part numbers for various components. If you've misplaced the manual, you can often find a digital version on the Cuisinart website or through a simple online search ""[Cuisinart model number] user manual.""
3.  **use the Cuisinart Part Number Lookup:** Many online parts retailers offer a **Cuisinart part number lookup** tool.Enter your model number, and the tool will display a diagram or list of compatible parts. This is an invaluable resource for accurate identification.
4.  **Visually Inspect the Broken Part:** Carefully examine the broken or worn part. Note its shape, size, colour, and any markings. Compare it to images of parts online to confirm you're requesting the correct Item.
5.  **Take Pictures:** if possible, take clear pictures of the appliance and the broken part. These can be helpful when communicating with customer service representatives at parts suppliers.

As a notable example, if you need a **cuisinart food processor replacement parts**, knowing whether it's a cuisinart DLC-8S, DLC-10S, or another model is crucial. Similarly, for **cuisinart blender parts**, specifying whether you have a **Cuisinart CBT** series blender will narrow down the search significantly.

1ju3v6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1ju3v6a/short_horror_story_feedback_requested_title_wake/,"Short horror story, feedback requested, title - Wake","Hello, very much a newbie writer, and have been chipping away at short stories, to practice, and also to build skills to expand on story ideas into a potential novel, or novella. 

I was chatting with someone recently who told me about a short story contest in my area, 600 words, horror themed, the contest will be around Halloween, today I had an idea and wrote a draft this evening, already over the word count, but also just wondering if this idea has already been done to death (pun intended), and, any general feedback would be greatly appreciated, here goes:

Wake

The funeral home was filled with well wishers on a rainy night. A clock radio in a back room played static laden music from a local station. Old friends mingled, extended family quietly ate sandwiches and drank tea, teachers from school talked about the old days, his girlfriend from high school was there with her husband. Why would she be here? he thought. An old classmate from junior high was one of the co-owners of the home now, he could hear him talking in another room, greeting people as they came in, it had been a few decades since those days sitting in the homeroom having lunch together, he wondered why his old classmate didn’t recognize him. 

“Thank you for coming, yes it was a shock.”
“He was driving home from work during a storm, they said it was distracted driving, hydroplaned. Shockin I know.”
“Looks good, they did a great job on him”
“Man, it’s crazy, I was just talking to him last week.”
“It will be a celebration of life, this Saturday at 2pm. No, there won’t be a service, it’s what he wanted.”

He could see a crack in the ceiling, he was completely still, listening to the gathered guests making small talk, some were cracking jokes. The smell of burnt coffee lingered in the air. His ex and her husband had quietly left early without speaking to him. Bizarre. Young, restless children begged to be taken home, they were bored, he wished someone would take him home too. 

An hour passed, as the rain kept on, the crowd started to thin. His body felt like it was stuck in cement, is this a dream, why can’t I move? He tried moving his arms to get up, but with each attempt, a sharp pain rang through his stiff body, as if he was held down, trapped under a car. 

Looking up, he could see water forming along the cracks, they had a leak. A single drop came down and hit him on the forehead, what is happening? With every breath, he felt as if he were suffocating. Half a minute later, another drop, same spot. Ten seconds later, another, more came after that in a steady drop. He tried to scream but nothing came out, this has to be a dream. Wake up.

“You okay bud?” His uncle was checking on his nephew, who had left the room for a while. “Can we go soon?” “Sure, go say goodbye to your aunt.”

“Hey, we’re going to go, I, just, I’m sorry, I know you’re sad, I’m sad too, I don’t know.” His cousin gave his aunt a hug, she softly hugged him back and thanked him for coming. “He always liked you, said you two used to play video games in the basement when he would visit.” she said. “Yeah, he was cool, see you later.” His cousin wiped his nose on his sleeve, and headed for the coat room. His uncle hugged his sister and said “call me if you need anything.” 

Another severe chill washed over him like a heavy weight, the coldest he’d ever felt in his life, he could feel his bones locked so tight they felt like they would break. Why wasn’t anyone noticing him? He tried to speak, but nothing came out, the steady drip from the ceiling was like a frozen blade, he felt like he was being crushed. 

His mother stood beside him, she said a silent prayer to herself, and then “Oh my, what’s this on your face? Excuse me, does someone have a cloth? I think there’s a drip in the ceiling.” His old classmate quickly ran in with a handtowel, which he used to dab the water from his forehead. “I’m so sorry ma’am, we’ve been meaning to get that fixed.” He could see a look of recognition this time, it was one of pity.

“Thank you. Goodbye for now son, I’ll see you on Saturday.” his mother kissed him on the forehead where the water had been.

1ju3v66,https://www.reddit.com/r/HardVV/comments/1ju3v66/chapter_1_in_which_the_world_ends_poorly/,Chapter 1: In Which The World Ends Poorly,"The stones beneath Lord Valerius Volkov’s boots trembled. Not with the resonant thrum of dark magic he commanded, nor the synchronized footsteps of his once mighty but now tragically obliterated skeletal legions, but with the crude, percussive impact of a battering ram against his castle’s main gate. Each *thump,* each *strike,* an insult to his otherworldly. Each distant, flickering torch held by the mob below was a burning effrontery to the eternal night he represented.

From the crumbling parapet of his highest tower, Valerius surveyed the inevitable. Nocturne, his ancestral domain for seven miserable centuries, was turning against him. Below, the village of Oakhaven, usually a cowering collection of hovels good only for sustenance and the occasional thrall, was a swarm of furious fireflies. Unbridled rage towards Valerius festered amongst their ranks.

The usually passive and entirely unnoteworthy peasants, whipped into a frenzy of hate by a new hero. Not just spurred on by his accomplishments, his accolades, his do-goodery. They were led by *him*. Sir Kaelen. The self-righteous, silver-plated boil on Valerius’ unwashed buttocks.

Kaelen’s ridiculous ""Consecrated Blade"" had carved through Valerius’s elite guard like he often carved through the local ladies. His munitions of holy water -- a truly vulgar invention -- had reduced Valerius’ battalions of zombies to steaming piles of bone and liquified flesh. Valerius clenched his fists, ancient rings digging into his unnaturally pale skin. His army was gone. His lieutenants were dust and whispers. Only this crumbling fortress remained, and the mob was at the door.

Desperation clawed at his throat, a sensation colder and sharper than the hunger. He, Valerius Volkov, Lord of Shadow and Scion of the First Blood, would *not* end his reign dragged into the mud by pitchfork-wielding peasants and a glorified tinsmith.

He turned from the parapet, his tattered velvet cloak swirling around him, and stalked back into the ritual chamber. Dust motes danced in the slivers of moonlight piercing the arrow slits, illuminating haphazard stacks of forbidden texts and esoteric paraphernalia. In the center of the floor, a complex circle drawn in blood, salt, and powdered bone pulsed with a faint, malevolent energy. It was a work of rushed artistry, flawed, perhaps, but born of absolute necessity.

""You leave me no choice, Kaelen,"" Valerius hissed, the words tasting like vinegar and piss in his mouth. ""You and your witless sheep demand oblivion? You shall have it.""

He raised his hands, ignoring the stinging protest of drained power in his limbs. He began the chant, syllables torn from a language dead before mortals learned to shape clay or wipe their asses. The air thickened, grew heavy, tasting of ozone and grave dirt. The lines of the circle glowed brighter, shifting from crimson to a violent violet. Power, raw and untamed, surged into the room – far more than he’d anticipated, and tinged with something… *wrong*. Unstable.

*‘Xar’zoth, Chained Oblivion, He Who Devours Stars… I offer thee a feast! These invaders! Their souls, their fear! Grant me vengeance! Grant me…’*

Suddenly the atmosphere changed, the air began to scream. Outside, the shouts of the mob and the thudding of the ram were drowned out by a rising, deafening shriek that seemed to come from the sky itself. Valerius staggered back, eyes wide, as the violet light of the circle flared blindingly white. The symbols warped. The energy buckled. He realized that something had gone wrong.

Was it his rushing to create the circle of power? Did he not use the right amount of bone to salt. He hadn’t had time to make the correct calculations. Kaelen had rushed him into this mess and he could only hope that it was enough, that through some miracle he had succeeded. Yet, as he watched the circles colors warp he knew a miracle would not come for him on this day.

He looked up, through a suddenly disintegrating ceiling, past the storm clouds Kaelen’s pet cleric had failed to conjure away. High, impossibly high, a new star blazed – a malevolent pinprick expanding with terrifying speed. It wasn’t the cold, cosmic dread of Xar’zoth’s arrival. It was fire. Raw, physical, *celestial* fire.

""No,"" Valerius breathed, the single word swallowed by the roar. ""Well fuck, that’s not…""

He hadn’t summoned a god. He’d summoned… *impact*.

The world ended not with a whisper, nor the satisfying crunch of divine retribution, but with the vulgar, incandescent fury of a mountain falling from the heavens. Valerius saw the horizon ignite, the very air catching fire. His castle, his world, his *everything* dissolved in a wave of impossible heat and force. He felt a sensation like being turned inside out, ripped apart atom by atom, yet simultaneously *pulled* – yanked sideways through a reality tearing like wet parchment.

Then, mercifully, blackness. Oblivion.

Oblivion, it turned out, smelled faintly of stale coffee, sugary syrup, and disinfectant.

Valerius coughed, the sound unnervingly loud in the sudden, oppressive silence. Cold, smooth tile pressed against his cheek. A relentless, humming drone filled the air, punctuated by the gentle *thrum* of unseen mechanisms. He blinked, his vision swimming. Gone was the comforting dark of his tower, the fiery end of Nocturne. Instead, harsh, unwavering white light assaulted his sensitive eyes from long tubes fixed to the ceiling.

He pushed himself up, his ancient bones protesting, his muscles feeling like sodden meat. His power… it felt distant, muted, like a shouted echo down the long hallways of his previous abode. He was weak, weaker than he'd felt since his fledgling nights hunting children, elderly folk, and sheep. (Sheep could put up a pretty remarkable fight if you weren’t prepared.)

He stood in a narrow aisle flanked by towering racks filled with… bizarrely colored packets and containers. Strange glyphs adorned them – CHEESE ZOES, SODA POP, BEEF JERKY and what was a seemingly unending variety of snack foods. The air was chilled and sterile. Where in the Nine Hells *was* he?

***Welcome, Subject Designation: Valerius Volkov (Provisional).***

The voice wasn't heard, but *felt* – a cool, clinical presence directly inside his skull, devoid of inflection but dripping with something that might have been condescending amusement.

Valerius recoiled, clutching his head. ""Who's there? What sorcery is this?""

***Species: Homo Nosferatu (Extinct Variant). Origin: Dimension 7-Gamma-Theta (Terminated). Status confirmed: Utterly screwed.***

""Terminated?"" Valerius whispered, the cold dread returning, sharper now than the physical chill of the floor. The meteor… it hadn’t just been his castle?

***Correct. Your ill-advised pyrotechnic summoning resulted in Total Planetary Annihilation Event classification: Class 5 Dumbass. Collateral damage estimate: One (1) habitable world, population negligible (mostly peasants and some venereal disease infested street walkers).***

Valerius swayed. Gone. All of it. Kaelen, the mob, Nocturne… his home. Gone because of *him*. The weight of it was staggering.

***You have been involuntarily enrolled in the 'Multiversal Rehabilitation and Entertainment Initiative'. A program designed for displaced entities, cosmic oopsies, and particularly entertaining failures such as yourself and former popstars. Consider this less a 'second chance' and more 'extended observational confinement with mandatory participation'. Your performance will be monitored, graded, and likely mocked.***

""Entertainment?"" Valerius snarled, though the sound lacked its usual menace. ""I am Lord Valerius Volkov! I am not some jester for unseen masters!""

***Current Status: Disoriented, Power Levels Critically Depleted (Suck it up, buttercup), Fashion Sense: Appalling (Seriously, crushed velvet went out with the Dark Ages you just vaporized). You are currently located in Sector 8-Sigma-Secondary, Designation: 'ReGenesis Sector-7', Sub-location: 'OmniMart Convenience Mart', Aisle 3 ('Snacks and Regret').***

The voice paused, as if savoring his confusion.

***Objective: Survive. Adapt. Entertain. Failure to comply may result in... unpleasantness. Your continued existence is probationary.***

***First Task Issued: Analysis Required. You appear malnourished and existentially distraught. Locate item designated Goldie’s Snack Cake. Acquire and analyze nutritional content (or lack thereof). Report findings. Bonus points for dramatic monologues while consuming.***

Valerius stared down the brightly lit aisle, at the rows upon rows of alien packaging. Goldies? Snack cake? His world was now nothing more than cosmic dust, his power eviscerated, his very existence now apparently the subject of some cosmic bureaucracy's amusement, and his first command was to… investigate a treat?

The sheer, soul-crushing absurdity of it all threatened to overwhelm him. He wanted to scream, to rage, to unleash torrents of dark power… but all that came out was a dry, broken sound.

There Are STRANGE RULES to Follow.,"**Have you ever had a job that just felt wrong?** Not just the kind of wrong where you drag yourself out of bed and mutter about your paycheck or your manager under your breath—but the kind of wrong that settles in your bones. The kind that makes your skin itch and your gut whisper, *“You shouldn’t be here.”* That’s my job.

I work alone as the lighthouse keeper at a place called Blackridge Point. You’ve probably never heard of it, and honestly, that’s for the best. It’s not on any popular maps. No tourists ever come close. Even locals pretend it’s not there. And you know what? They’re right to. Because something about Blackridge Point feels like it was never meant to be found—like the earth itself regrets making room for it.

Now, normally, a lighthouse is supposed to help ships—shine a light so they don’t crash into rocks or get lost at sea. That’s the idea I had when I accepted the position. I thought I’d be doing something good. Helpful. Maybe even noble. But here? At this lighthouse? The light doesn’t guide anything. It traps something. It holds it in. The beam isn’t a welcome—it’s a warning.

And tonight? Tonight’s not like the others.

Tonight, I found something I was never supposed to find.

I wasn’t even searching for anything unusual when I found it. It was just a routine night shift, one of the hundreds I’ve done in this cold, salt-bitten tower that groans with every gust of wind. You’d think after two years, I’d have seen it all. But this place… this place always holds something back, just long enough to make you think it’s safe.

That night, I had decided to clean the supply room. Just something to break the endless silence. The room was cluttered with old, forgotten things—cracked lanterns, rusted tools, thick manuals that hadn’t been opened in decades. It smelled like mold and old wood and something else… something sharp in the back of the throat.

I was moving a stack of unused logbooks when I saw it. A brittle sheet of yellowed paper, wedged between the back wall and a shelf support beam. I pulled it free. It crackled under my fingers. No title. No signature. Just seven rules, handwritten in a shaky scrawl that made it feel like the person writing it hadn’t slept in weeks.

And those rules? They didn’t feel like the kind of thing someone made up for fun. They felt… lived.

**“Lock the door at exactly 11:00 PM. If you hear knocking after that, do not open it. No one you want to see would be knocking.”**

That was the first line. Simple. But chilling.

**“The light must stay on. If it flickers, you must turn it back on immediately. Even if it means going outside.”**

My heart skipped. I had done that before. Gone outside when the power glitched in a storm. I thought it was normal. Necessary maintenance.

**“Avoid looking directly at the water after midnight. If you hear something calling your name, it is lying. If the water tries to talk to you, —shut your mouth and don’t answer.”**

My breath caught. I remembered the time I thought I heard someone yelling from the cliffs. I had almost shouted back.

**“If you see a man standing at the edge of the cliff, do not acknowledge him. Do not speak. Do not approach.”**

A cold sweat began to spread across my back. I *had* seen someone like that. Just once. A few weeks ago. I thought it was a trick of the light.

**“You must leave at exactly 4:00 AM. Not a minute before. Not a minute after.”**

I’d always left around 4, but never on the dot. Never knew it mattered. Maybe it does.

**“When the fog rolls in thick, do not look outside the window. You might see something you wish you hadn’t.”**

I thought about the nights when the fog came in so dense I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face. I had stared out the window just to feel less alone.

**“Every new moon, the ship will return. Do not acknowledge it. Do not try to stop it. Do not watch.”**

That one hit me hardest. I hadn’t seen any ship. But the moon was a sliver tonight. A new moon was coming.

I stood there, staring at the list, my hands trembling slightly around the edges of the paper. It felt like the air around me thickened, like the room itself held its breath.

At first, I laughed. A weak, shaky laugh. Thought maybe it was just some old joke from a previous keeper. Some creepy tradition to mess with the new guy.

But the longer I held that paper, the more the silence seemed to lean in closer. Like the whole lighthouse was watching me.

And deep down, I realized something.

This wasn’t a warning left behind.

It was a dare.

A test.

And without knowing it, I’d already been following some of the rules.

I’d already been playing the game.

Whether I liked it or not.

I tried to distract myself. Really, I did. I paced around the main floor of the lighthouse. Picked up a dusty book from the side table, flipped through pages without seeing a word. I even turned on the little battery-powered radio, hoping to catch a fuzzy station from the mainland—but all I got was static. Through it all, my hands wouldn’t stop shaking. They trembled like I’d been out in the cold too long, even though the thick stone walls of the lighthouse kept the wind out. It wasn’t the cold. It was fear—cold, quiet, creeping fear.

The first rule had seemed simple when I read it. **“Lock the door at exactly 11:00 PM.”** Easy, right? Just turn the key and walk away. So that’s what I did. I walked over to the heavy iron door, the one at the bottom of the spiral staircase, and I turned the lock. Once. Then again, just to be sure. The metal groaned in protest, like it didn’t want to be locked. That should’ve been my first clue.

And then—at exactly 11:03—I heard it. The knocking started.

**Knock.**

A pause.

**Knock.**

Another pause.

**Knock.**

Three slow, deliberate knocks. Then silence. The kind of silence that presses against your ears, waiting to see what you’ll do.

I froze where I stood, eyes wide. I hadn’t expected it to actually *happen*. I hadn’t even remembered hearing knocking before tonight. But now that I was really listening, really tuned in, it struck me—I *had* heard this before. Maybe not consciously, but deep in my brain, the sound had been there. Buried. Like a memory you pretend isn’t yours.

And that’s when it hit me: this had been happening *every single night*.

I just hadn’t noticed.

Or maybe—I hadn’t wanted to.

I took a step back from the door. The lighthouse was on a cliff. It’s not like someone could just wander up here. There’s a narrow trail that leads from the shore, and the rocks down below are sharp and unforgiving. You’d *hear* someone climbing that path. Their footsteps would echo.

But tonight? I hadn’t heard a thing. 

And then—

**“Hello?”** 

The voice hit me like a slap across the face. It was male. Low. A little rough, like someone who hadn’t used it in a while. But there was something… wrong. Like a song sung by someone who knows all the words but doesn’t understand the meaning. Too steady. Too careful.

**“I… I think I’m lost,”** the voice said.

I didn’t move. My jaw clenched tight enough to hurt. I stared at the door like it might reach out and grab me.

*Lost?* Out here? In the middle of nowhere? At night? It made no sense.

I don’t know how I knew, but I *knew*—that voice wasn’t right. It didn’t *belong*.

**“Please,”** it said again, softer this time, like it was trying to sound weak. **“I don’t have much time… you have to let me in.”**

I almost—*almost*—reached for the door. Something in me twitched. Reflex. Instinct. That old human habit of helping someone in need.

But then, my eyes flicked to the paper I’d tucked into my coat pocket.

**Rule #1: Do not open the door.**

My fingers tightened around the coat fabric. I stepped back.

The voice kept going, pleading, begging, insisting. Each word more convincing than the last. It tried to sound scared. Then kind. Then angry. But I kept still. Kept my mouth shut.

Then, without warning, the voice just… stopped.

Silence. Not even a breath.

And then, the footsteps.

But they weren’t the kind of footsteps that echoed on a stone path. No. These were different. No crunch of gravel. No rustle of brush. Just a soft, steady rhythm—like feet padding over empty air.

They didn’t head back down the trail.

They didn’t fade into the woods.

They simply… walked away. Into the pitch-black night that stretched beyond the lighthouse like an endless sea of nothing.

I didn’t breathe.

Then—something slid under the door. A soft, scraping sound like paper across stone.

I stared at the bottom of the door.

A piece of paper.

Bloodied.

Not just smudged—but *soaked* in dark, rust-colored blotches.

I hesitated. My fingers hovered near it, unsure. It could be a trick. It could be a trap. But leaving it there felt worse.

So, carefully, I picked it up. The edges were sticky. The smell—metallic, sharp, sickening.

I turned it over and slowly unfolded it.

There were words. Shaky, handwritten lines like the rules, but smaller, messier. I began to read.

But I didn’t get far.

Because the moment my eyes hit the second line—

**The lights flickered.**

Not a soft flicker. Not a gentle dim.

A hard stutter. On, off, *on*.

And for the first time that night…

I realized I wasn’t alone.

When I glanced at the clock, it read **12:00 AM** exactly.

Midnight.

The second my eyes registered the time, the lighthouse light—my only real protection against whatever nightmares Blackridge Point held—**flickered again**. A single, sharp blink. Then another.

Once.

Twice.

And then—**darkness**.

The beam that usually swept steadily over the black ocean just vanished. Gone. Just like that. No warning. No hum of dying power. Just... out. And in that instant, something deep inside me *knew* this wasn’t a simple malfunction. This wasn’t normal.

The second rule. I remembered it clearly now.

**""The light must stay on. If it flickers, you must turn it back on immediately. Even if it means going outside.""**

A cold jolt of panic ripped through my chest. My throat tightened. My heart started hammering so fast it felt like it might crack my ribs. I fumbled for the flashlight on the nearby table, snatched it up with shaking hands, and bolted for the staircase. The old spiral steps groaned beneath my feet as I raced up toward the lantern room.

The cold hit me halfway up.

Not normal cold. Not just sea air cold.

It was *wrong*.

By the time I reached the top, I could *see* my breath. Thick white clouds spilling from my mouth like smoke from a fire. My fingers were numb already, the metal railing burning my skin like ice.

And then—the light above me dimmed to a soft glow… and died.

Everything went black.

Total.

Utter.

Black.

I turned on my flashlight. The weak yellow beam cut through the room like a knife, shaking with every tremble of my hand. I swung it toward the generator, heart thudding in my ears louder than the wind outside.

I hit the main switch.

**Click.**

Nothing.

Not a spark. Not a hum. Nothing.

My breath caught in my throat. I moved toward the backup generator, hope clinging to me like a lifeline.

But something stopped me.

Not a noise.

Not a touch.

Just a *feeling*. That crawling, skin-tightening sense of being watched. Of something **out there**.

And then—from the corner of my eye—I saw it.

Something was standing outside.

Still. Unmoving. Just at the edge of the cliff, past where the light usually reached.

It wasn’t a person.

It looked like a person if you were squinting from far away and had never seen one before. It had the shape. The form. But something was *off*. It was too tall. Too thin. Its arms hung in a way that made my stomach twist. And where its face should’ve been—there was just a smear of shifting black. No eyes. No mouth. Just a suggestion of a head, swirling like smoke held in a jar.

It didn’t move.

It just stood there.

Watching.

**Watching me.**

Or maybe the lighthouse.

Either way, the message was clear.

The light was off.

And it was waiting.

I turned back toward the generator, my hands nearly useless from the cold. They slipped off the knobs once, twice, before I managed to grip the ignition switch. I glanced over my shoulder.

The shape had taken a step forward.

I panicked. Slammed my palm against the ignition.

**Come on. Come on. Come on—**

With a loud roar, the generator coughed, sputtered, and finally **roared to life**.

The light above me flared. It didn’t flicker—it *blazed*, shooting out through the foggy night like a sword made of fire. The whole room filled with a warm, blinding glow.

I turned, heart in my throat, and looked back toward the cliff.

Gone.

The figure was **gone**.

Not a trace. Not a footprint. Not a whisper in the wind.

Just the night.

And that cursed, endless sea.

**“What? What was that?”** I whispered to myself, as if saying it aloud would make it real. My heart thumped wildly in my chest, loud and uneven like a warning drum. My mind spun in circles, refusing to settle. Every second that passed made the silence around me feel heavier, like it was pressing down on my lungs. I tried to distract myself, moving clumsily from one half-done task to another — checking oil levels, adjusting the beams, wiping already clean surfaces — anything to keep my hands moving and my thoughts quiet. But no matter what I did, that sharp edge of unease only grew sharper.

People don’t take lighthouse jobs for fun. No one dreams about spending months isolated in a cold, creaking tower by the sea, cut off from the world. You don’t wake up one day and say, *“I want to be alone with nothing but foghorns and sea spray for company.”* No. You end up here because you're running. Hiding. Escaping.

**My reason?** It was simple. I had nothing left. Nothing to hold onto. Nothing to keep me in the world I once called home.

I grew up in a small, quiet town built on the edge of a reservation. The kind of place where stories floated in the wind and people still nodded at things unseen. My grandfather was a proud, wrinkled man who’d survived too much and said too little. He used to sit by the fire and tell us stories that sounded more like warnings than tales. He spoke of spirits that didn’t stay dead, voices that called from the water, and fog that carried more than just moisture. As a boy, I laughed it off. I thought it was just a part of our culture’s way of scaring kids into behaving.

But then... the crash.

My wife. My little boy. Gone. One rainy night and a slippery highway and just... nothing.

After that, everything my grandfather said started sounding less like myth and more like memory.

All I wanted was to disappear. To stop hearing the echo of toys that weren’t played with anymore. To stop seeing her mug in the cupboard and his boots by the door. I needed silence. Distance. Emptiness.

So when the job at Blackridge Lighthouse came up, I said yes without thinking twice. The pay was good, the expectations were low, and best of all, no one asked questions.

But now… now I was starting to wonder if I hadn’t chosen this place — if it had chosen me.

I tried to shake it off. Told myself I was just tired, that grief does weird things to the mind. I sat back down with my coffee, the cup trembling in my hand. Then, the old grandfather clock ticked past 12:30… and I heard it.

A voice.

**“Hello?”** I called out, more habit than hope. But the hairs on my arms stood up.

It was outside. By the water.

And it said my name.

Clear. Soft. Familiar.

My whole body stiffened. My mouth went dry.

Rule #3 of the Blackridge Keeper’s Manual: *Avoid looking directly at the water after midnight*

At first, I joked about the rules.

Laughed them off like some weird initiation prank, when I first got here. But I followed them. Always. Until now.

Because that voice… that voice wasn’t just any voice.

It was **my mother’s.**

And she’s been gone for ten years.

**“No, no, no…”** I whispered. But even as I said it, my legs began to move. Like they didn’t care what the rulebook said. Like they belonged to someone else.

I made my way to the small circular window, the one that gave me the perfect view of the sea. I didn’t even realize I was crying until the salt from my tears stung the corners of my mouth.

**“Come down here. Please. I need you.”**

That voice — it *was* her. The gentle way she used to call me when dinner was ready. The way she used to soothe me when I cried after nightmares.

My hands clenched the windowsill. My knees locked. My brain screamed *don’t*, but my heart whispered *what if?*

Then, I saw it.

The water wasn’t calm. It was moving, twitching almost, like it was panicking.

Something wasn’t coming *through* the water.

Something was pushing the water away.

It churned, spun, and pulled back in slow, hesitant waves, as if it wanted nothing to do with what was rising from below.

I couldn’t breathe.

Because it began to take shape.

Not a man. Not a woman. Not any creature I’d ever seen or read about.

But a shape. Living. Wrong. Impossible.

It didn’t belong in this world.

**“No. No, what the hell is that…”** I whispered, my voice cracking.

And for the first time in my life, I realized that water — the very thing we need to live, the thing that brings life and peace and calm — could be horrifying.

**Oh my God. Oh my damn God.**

My survival instincts kicked in, sharp and fast. My eyes slammed shut without permission.

And then, the sound.

A scrape.

Right against the window.

Slow. Scratching.

Like fingernails.

One. By. One.

I froze. I didn’t breathe. The only thing I heard was the pounding of blood in my ears.

Then — silence.

No voice. No whispers.

When I dared to open my eyes, the window was fogged with thick condensation.

And written across the glass, as clear as daylight:

**DON’T BREAK THE RULES.**

# By now, I was a wreck — completely drained, inside and out. My nerves felt like frayed wires sparking with every sound. My fingers wouldn’t stop trembling, even when I clenched them into fists. My chest was tight, like something heavy had settled inside it and refused to move. I kept telling myself that if I could just make it to morning, things would be okay. Maybe it would all seem like a dream. A horrible, twisted dream. I just had to hold on. But my body didn’t believe my thoughts anymore. I was tired. And scared in a way I hadn’t known a person could be scared.

I don’t even remember how the hours slipped away after that thing at the window. One moment, it was just after midnight. Then it was nearly four. My mind had stopped keeping track of time — like it knew it didn’t want to be awake for what came next.

At **3:45**, the world changed again.

It started with a smell — wet and heavy, like rotting seaweed and damp rope. Then, the fog came in. Thick. Too thick. It rolled in like it had a mind of its own, curling around the lighthouse in heavy blankets, choking the light. I could barely see the edge of my own desk. It was the kind of fog that didn’t just block sight — it swallowed sound too. Everything became muffled. Still.

I tried to keep my eyes down. I really did. I stared at the floor, blinked fast, focused on the beat of my heart. But then… I heard it.

**Creeeeak.**

Wood. Old, splintering wood under pressure.

Then another sound — metallic, low and dull.

**Clang. Clang.**

It rang out in the distance like a bell being swayed by an unseen hand.

A ship’s bell.

I stopped breathing.

Carefully, like a child hiding under the covers, I turned my head just enough to look through the window again. The fog was so thick, I thought I’d see nothing. But then, faintly, like a memory rising from deep sleep… I saw it.

A ship.

Barely visible. Like a shadow in the mist.

It glided across the surface of the ocean — too smooth, too quiet. No splashing. No waves around its hull. It didn’t disturb the water at all. It was just… moving. Silently. As if it wasn’t part of the world we know.

Its sails were torn, flapping gently like old fabric left to rot. The wood of the ship was cracked, discolored, and yet it held together as if stubbornly refusing to sink. It was wrong. This ship didn’t belong to this time — maybe not to any time.

And then I saw the **figures**.

They stood along the deck. Still. Watching.

They were shaped like people… but not truly people anymore.

Some of them were missing arms. One had no face at all — just smooth, pale skin stretched over where features should be. A few stood with mouths open, wide and empty, their jaws slack in endless screams. But none of them made a sound. They just **stared**. Every single one of them… facing the lighthouse.

Facing me.

I froze, unable to tear my eyes away. My skin crawled. My legs locked up. I couldn’t run, couldn’t even blink.

Then, one of the figures **moved**.

It raised its hand.

Not in greeting. Not in peace.

**It pointed.**

Right at me.

I felt like throwing up. My stomach twisted in on itself. My mind screamed for an explanation, but deep down — somewhere I didn’t want to look — I already knew.

This wasn’t some forgotten ghost story passed down from drunken sailors.

This was real.

All of it.

The rules. The whispers. The scratching on the window. The voice that sounded like my mother.

**The ship.**

It wasn’t just floating through the mist for no reason.

It was **coming back. Again. And again. And again.**

And now I understood why.

The bloodied paper I’d found earlier this night — crumpled and stuffed behind the logs — it had told the truth. I hadn’t understood it before. I hadn’t wanted to.

But now it made perfect, terrible sense.

The last keeper — he had made one mistake. Just one.

He had let the lighthouse go dark, even if only for a minute. And in that minute, the sea took what it wanted. The ship had crashed. Lives were lost. Or maybe something worse than lives.

Now, every new moon, the ship returned. Searching. Yearning. Not for answers.

**For vengeance.**

And if it couldn’t find him — the one who had failed — it would take **whoever** had replaced him.

Me.

My legs gave out, but I caught myself on the desk. I turned away from the window. I didn’t want to see it vanish. I didn’t want to watch those lifeless faces melt into the fog.

But I knew it had disappeared.

Back into the sea.

For now.

And something inside me whispered the truth I didn’t want to say out loud:

**It would come back.**

And next time… it might not leave empty-handed.

# I didn’t let myself breathe again until my boots touched the damp stone just outside the lighthouse at exactly 4:00 AM. The moment I stepped into the open air, my lungs filled with a sharp, cold breath that hit me like a slap. The sky had begun to change — not quite light, not yet morning — just that eerie shade of gray that makes everything feel uncertain. The mist still clung to everything, not as thick as before, but heavy enough that the world still felt muffled and far away. Like the fog didn’t want to let go of the night. Like it wanted to hold me there a little longer.

I turned around slowly. Behind me, the lighthouse stood tall and silent. The golden beam of its rotating light sliced clean through the mist, like a sword fighting back the darkness. It was steady. Reliable. A symbol of safety for anyone out at sea. But for me?

It didn’t feel like safety anymore.

It felt like **a warning**.

I had done what I was told. I hadn’t broken any rules. I’d kept the light going, kept my eyes mostly where they should be, kept myself from listening too closely to voices I shouldn’t have heard. I had **survived** the night.

But at what cost?

And for how long could I keep doing this?

I stood there, staring at the rotating light, as if it could give me answers. I had spent the last two years telling myself this place was peace. Telling myself I had found **escape** in the silence, in the isolation. I told myself that I had run here to find quiet after my life had been ripped apart.

But what if that was never the truth?

What if I hadn’t come here to escape anything?

What if I had been **called** here?

The idea slithered into my mind, slow and sickening. What if I wasn’t just hiding from pain… but being **punished** by it?

Maybe this wasn’t a job. Maybe it was **a sentence**.

Maybe Blackridge didn’t offer solitude. Maybe it offered a cage made of fog and regret — a place where men were **sent** to feel every mistake echo forever in the sea.

And suddenly, something became painfully clear:

No matter how closely I followed the rules…

No matter how loyal I stayed to the routine, how sharp I kept the light, how silent I kept my thoughts…

**One day**, the lighthouse **wouldn't** protect me.

One day, I wouldn’t be allowed to leave.",4,1744081570.0,Ruleshorror,2,1.0,False

1ju3rfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ATC_Hiring/comments/1ju3rfi/just_did_my_atsa/,just did my ATSA,"hi everyone, I'm new to this subreddit so apologies if this post is too mundane and shouldn't really be made a post out of but earlier today I did my ATSA and I don't feel well about how I performed at all so I just wanted to put my thoughts into words tbh.

I scheduled my exam on 19 March, so I had plenty of time to prepare. My exam was scheduled at a good time for me, and also wasn't far from where I live. I specifically tried to make my day as easy and stress-free as possible heading into the exam; I went to bed early and got about 10 hours of sleep, I got a family member to prepare breakfast for me, and I barely looked at my phone throughout the day. I also drank coffee prior to the exam, with the hopes that it would help me be more alert for the gamified rounds. I didn't do any of the study programs beforehand which require payment and mainly stuck to what I had through Peterson's, but after doing the exam, I don't think I could've really been much more prepared than I was.

Moving on to the actual exam, the only round which I feel confident I did well on was the memory variables one. I'm pretty sure I completely botched the number differences one; to my knowledge, this round is basically a freebie for most people, but I ended up missing quite a few answers (at least four I'm sure) and I don't think I went very fast either. For some reason, I struggled concentrating on this round, which wasn't an issue on any of the other ones. Also, I didn't even realize that you were supposed to try to answer quickly until I was about a third of the way through. I feel like a complete moron for that tbh (I'm assuming I skimmed over it in the instructions or something). I'm also pretty certain that I botched the collisions round; iirc I definitely got more than 10 collisions. For some reason, on numerous occasions I ended up pressing a number key which was not the key I was intending to press. I genuinely do not understand how this happened so many times; I spend hours copiously practicing my number pad typing. Also, I had no issues answering plenty of math problems. I literally only looked at them once I was done handling the balls on the screen so idk if I did something wrong? Everyone I've seen who has scored well has said that they didn't answer many math problems. I also think I did badly on the personality round; for some reason I'm really bad with personality tests and even when I'm answering honestly I always seem to put answers that are seen as being conflicting. I think there's something wrong with my brain to where it overcomplicates personality questions and restricts my ability to answer them in simple binary terms because I think of my personality as being complex. The rest of the ones I might have done okay on but idk; the spatial relationships round I definitely missed at least a few but everything went by super fast so I think I missed some which I didn't notice while doing the quiz, while the last two rounds I basically skimmed over a lot of the questions because I was worried about time so I think I probably missed some details and answered some of them wrong because of that.

I really don't know what happened tbh. My preparation was good, I was well-rested, and I wasn't particularly nervous or stressed during my exam. I don't even think the test should have been particularly difficult for me honestly; I think the only round which I saw as being challenging was the personality test. I don't think I should have struggled at all with the number differences round or the collisions round. Is there something wrong with me? Am I just not cut out to be an air traffic controller? Or maybe I'm overreacting?",2,1744081433.0,ATC_Hiring,1,0.75,False

I accept donated ingredients, but it's not necessary to pick up something.  If you donate expired/rotting food I will block you.

I do not do special requests, bake sales, and non profits, so don't ask.  If you see something posted you want to pick up to give to a charity that would be great.  

But do not try to arrange something for me to make things for a specific reason.  My anxiety cannot handle it.

Please do not come here and suggest I take a class, or sell baked goods. That is ablist, unsupportive, and upsetting.

I think this would go without saying, but you need to tell me if you cannot make it.  After I wait an hour no call no show, I will move onto the next person.  If this happens repeatedly I will block you.  No exceptions.

I feel this goes without saying as well but I need to say it.  if you send me a message asking to borrow money I will block you.  No exceptions.

I am autistic/ADHD, and am the only one doing this, so please be kind.

Today, I have two pans of peanut butter banana brownies to give away.

They have ripe bananas in them, melted butter, a little bit of coffee, milk chocolate chips throughout, and peanut butter and chips on top.

One had more chips and peanut butter on the top, so I grabbed more to even it out.

Someone donated bananas the other day, so I ate half and found a recipe for the other half.

These brownies smelled amazing coming out of the oven.

There are two pans, one pan per household.

They have foil on the top, so you can even heat them up in the oven when you get home if you like.

Sure! Here’s a friendly and SEO-style blog post reviewing ""Tobe Brockner - The 12 Week Year Masterclass and Advanced Training,"" around 500 words, easy to read, with headings, using a bit of casual and varying tone like you asked:

# What is The 12 Week Year Masterclass and Advanced Training?

Let’s get straight to it: **The 12 Week Year Masterclass and Advanced Training** is a self-paced course created by Tobe Brockner that promises to crank up your results in a crazy short time. Instead of thinking in “year-long” goals, this course teaches you how to plan and crush your goals in 12 weeks. Yep — *a quarter of the time, four times the results*.

It’s about working smarter, not harder, and honestly? That’s something most of us could seriously use.

# Who Created This Game-Changing Course?

Meet Tobe Brockner — not your typical ""productivity guru."" Tobe’s journey started because, just like the rest of us, he struggled with hitting his goals. Instead of giving up, he spent 15+ years studying high performance and turned what he learned into the **12 Week Year Masterclass and Advanced Training**.

He’s real, relatable, and totally upfront about the fact that learning how to perform better is a skill anyone can develop.

# Where Does The Magic Happen?

You can access everything inside the 12 Week Year Member’s Area — super easy. No classrooms, no tight schedules. It’s all online, self-paced, and waiting for you whenever you're ready to dive in. Each module has video trainings, exercises, and practical materials you can use right away.

You can literally be chilling at your favorite coffee shop, laptop open, leveling up your life. Cool, right?

# When Will You Start Seeing Results?

Honestly? Pretty fast — if you apply the strategies. Tobe’s method is about daily wins stacking up over time, so you’re not waiting a whole year to feel accomplished. Within the first few weeks of following the plan, you’ll probably start noticing you're getting *way* more done without feeling like you're grinding yourself into the ground. That’s the beauty of this system.

# Why Should You Care About The 12 Week Year?

Because let’s be real — most goal-setting systems suck. We get hyped in January and burnt out by March. **The 12 Week Year Masterclass and Advanced Training** flips the script. It shows you why traditional goal-setting fails, why holding yourself accountable is overrated, and what you actually need to stay on track and crush it.

If you've ever felt frustrated setting big dreams but falling short (hi, me too), this course might be your secret weapon.

# How Does The 12 Week Year Actually Work?

The training is split into 8 easy-to-follow modules. You’ll learn everything from why ""working less"" on your goals actually works better (seriously!) to the two biggest mistakes people make when setting goals. Plus, Tobe teaches you how to build plans that don’t fail and the real trick to staying consistent.

You don't just watch and move on — you actually implement as you go. It’s all about *taking action* and *seeing results fast*.

Overall, **The 12 Week Year Masterclass and Advanced Training** by Tobe Brockner feels like that missing puzzle piece if you’ve been spinning your wheels. If you want to live life on *your* terms and finally start crushing your goals, this might be the move you’ve been looking for.

**DAY 1 - INUYAMA >> NAKATSUGAWA**

* Touched down at Chubu Centrair International Airport at 7.30am.
* Took the airport train to Nagoya Station and stored our luggage in coin lockers. Then, we headed to Inuyama Station.
* Walked and explored around Honmachi-dori, the main street that leads to Inuyama Castle. There were not a lot of people, and not many shops were opened yet as it was still very early.
* Visited Sanko Inari Shrine. Bought a Goshuincho and got my very first Goshuin.
* Explored Inuyama Castle. The view from the top of the castle was amazing!
* Left the castle and went back to Honmachi-dori. Many shops were already opened. We had an interesting tofu-themed meal at [本町茶寮](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E6%9C%AC%E7%94%BA%E8%8C%B6%E5%AF%AE/@35.3813609,136.9407778,17.5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x60030e8a517a75ab:0xf526fd4cd05cb94c!8m2!3d35.3830879!4d136.9394728!16s%2Fg%2F1hc2m63pq?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).
* Walked to Daishoji and explored the temple grounds. From there, headed towards Inuyamayuen Station and took the train back to Nagoya Station.
* Retrieved our luggage and took the JR Shinano bound for Nakatsugawa.
* Reached Nakatsugawa Station and checked-in our hotel. Took a few hours nap, as we didn't have a proper sleep throughout our overnight flight.
* Woke up feeling much rested. Had a wonderful obanzai dinner at [笑処 あいろ](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E7%AC%91%E5%87%A6+%E3%81%82%E3%81%84%E3%82%8D/@35.501047,137.5000664,14.96z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x601cb449345fa075:0x55b6389b9e6a3907!2sNakatsugawa+Station!8m2!3d35.5004945!4d137.5031352!16s%2Fm%2F03npwm1!3m5!1s0x601cb57c3af6544d:0xd2cd59459b99dc0!8m2!3d35.4961359!4d137.5029687!16s%2Fg%2F11st_brj7l?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).

Step count: 17,560 steps

**DAY 2 - NAKASENDO WALK (OCHIAI , MAGOME , TSUMAGO)**

* Woke up at 5am on my own and went for a morning walk, exploring Nakatsugawa Town.
* Came back to the hotel at 8am and wife was up and ready. Took a bus to Ochiai and started our Nakasendo hike from Ochiai-juku.
* After 1h30m, we reached Magome-juku. What a beautiful post-town! We couldn't stop taking pictures!
* Explored around a bit and bought some coffee and sandwich for snacking. Then, we departed for Tsumago-juku.
* Really lovely countryside vibes along the way. As we're approaching Tsumago, we had goheimochi and knife-cut soba for lunch at[ Kongoya](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kongoya/@35.5650732,137.5904293,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x601cb7e4a54ef793:0xa914201960a04aa1!8m2!3d35.5650689!4d137.5930042!16s%2Fg%2F1tj7wg6g?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (it was the absolute BEST soba we've ever had in our lives!)
* After 3h10m of trail walking, we reached Tsumago-juku. Spent the next hour exploring around the town.
* Supposed to head to Narai-juku after this, unfortunately we missed the bus. The next bus doesn't go well with the train's timing, and we realized that it would be all dark the moment we arrive at Narai. So we scraped the plan.
* Continue walking another 45 minutes towards Nagiso Station and took the train back to Nakatsugawa.
* Visited the town's Valor Supermarket. Was really surprised how much cheaper everything here is, especially after the evening discount! Loaded up with lots of sashimi, bento and snacks and had a feast back at the hotel.

Took a train headed towards Toyokawa.
* Visited the Toyokawa Inari Shrine. Unlike other Inari Shrines, this one does not have many Torii Gates. Instead, loads of fox statues can be found around the shrine grounds. Really interesting place! We also bought some delicious Inari sushi for snacking.
* Originally, we were supposed to go to Toyohashi to try their specialty curry udon for dinner. However, since we were still really full from all the food we had for lunch, we decided to skip it and headed straight for Okazaki.
* Reaching Nishi-Okazaki Station, we bought some Hatcho Miso fried chicken at [Abarenbou Chicken ](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Abarenbou+Chicken/@34.9585383,137.1628831,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x6004bd31ffe263a9:0x95453bc2e9e143fc!4m6!3m5!1s0x6004bd31ffdeaaab:0x40ea79a7a6db4c35!8m2!3d34.9585339!4d137.165458!16s%2Fg%2F11bxjfry9_?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)(yummy!)

**TRAVEL TIPS**

1. IC Cards are not usable for public transports in countrysides like Kiso Valley and Takayama. If a bus doesn’t take IC cards, there will be a machine by the door for you to take a numbered ticket as you board the bus. You'll see a fare box beside the driver for collecting fares and tickets. There will also be a slot where you can put in ¥1000 yen notes and it’ll make coin change for you, so you can pay with the exact fare amount. So, just make sure to have some spare ¥1000 notes and you won't have any problems.
2. In rural regions, it is very important to know that trains and buses don't come very frequent like the ones in cities. Some even come once every few hours. Do check Google Maps for the bus/train time table and plan your itinerary around it.
3. Take advantage of the supermarkets around. They have more variety and generally cheaper goods compared to konbini stores. If you visit late evening onwards, they will have more discounts!

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

A completely different trip compared to our Kansai travel last year. Nonetheless, Central Japan has been really, really wonderful, and we absolutely had the time of our lives! 

There is only such we could do in a mere 12 days trip, and we didn't get to cover the northern regions such as Kanazawa, Fukui and Toyama. Well, that just gives us more reason to go back again! 

We are already missing Japan dearly, looking forward to our next trip back here in the near future. Till next time! ",8,1744081026.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False
1ju3l7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1ju3l7m/aita_for_apologizing_to_my_husband_45m_when_i32f/,AITA for apologizing to my husband (45M) when I(32F) am in the wrong?,"I know the title seems obvious but hear me out.

My husband (45M) and I (32F) have been together for 3 years, married for about a year and half. He has a lot of trust issues mostly because of his mother being very manipulative, and also a few bad relationships prior.

I have worked very hard to be patient and gentle and understanding of his traumas (of which he has many). And most of the time he is an AMAZING husband and he's loving and kind.

But a lot of the time when we have a disagreement and I am in the wrong, and I take ownership of that and apologize and promise him I will do better in the future, it just makes him more angry and he dismisses it as ""fake"" and ""manipulative"" and thinks I'm somehow trying to make him feel guilty.

Quick example: we have a coffee trailer and the fridge in it broke this past weekend. So I took it out to get serviced and bought a fairly cheap replacement fridge to use in the meantime. He absolutely flew off the handle because he saw it as a waste of money and that it's a ""cheap shitty fridge that'll break soon too"" and it's important to get good refrigeration to make sure we don't get anyone sick. I agreed with him that he was right and I shouldn't risk a cheap fridge that might not keep things cold enough and might make a customer sick. I said specifically ""You're right. I'm sorry."" and after some more discussion  ""I will do better when it comes to making these kinds of decisions with our business in the future, I promise"" and this made him even more angry and he shouted at me to cut it out with my ""fake mousy apology routine."" I was shocked and reassured him that I was genuine and he just kept shouting that I wasn't listening and I was pissing him off and he didn't want to talk about it anymore.

I'm just so confused, and wondering if he's in the right and I'm being an AH by apologizing this way. When you tell someone that they've done something wrong, isn't the literal best case scenario that they agree with you, apologize for the mistake, and agree to do better in the future? I have no idea what other response he was looking for. And I don't believe my demeanor came across as fake at all. I wasn't sarcastic or catty or sassy or anything. I made eye contact and stated it genuinely but he still doesn't believe me and is now furious and not speaking to me.

This isn't the first time something like this has happened either. It's like he just doesn't believe any apologies I make. I'm not sure if he just had bad relationships where they would apologize and then keep doing that thing so their apologies weren't sincere. But I don't do that and I genuinely follow through with my promises to do better.

How can I convince him my apologies are sincere? How can I help him move beyond these trust issues and go off of his past experiences with ME rather than his past experiences with his mother and other women? Am I doing something wrong when it comes to apologizing correctly? AITAH?

TLDR: My husband often takes my genuine apologies as being ""fake"" and insincere. Am I coming across as an AH in the way that I apologize? If I am the AH here, how can I better apologize in the future without being and AH?",3,1744080859.0,AITA_Relationships,2,1.0,False

1ju3kni,https://i.redd.it/z35od1hozite1.jpeg,Journey to Eureka Atom 75 and Ascaso Steel Duo,"TLDR 
Upgraded from GCP to Ascaso Steel Duo and from a J Max to an Eureka Atom 75. A all hiccup whilst purchasing the grinder, but very satisfied with the upgrade. 

Equipment
Now - Eureka Atom Specialty 75 and Ascaso Steel Duo. 15g IMS basket, bomber version of force tamper. 
Before - Gaggia Classic with barista gadgets PID and dimmer mod with 1zpresso J Max grinder
Before that -  Ascaso Eclipse (57mm snd panarella wand)

Use
2 espressos and 2 latter per day. 1 to 2 ratio. Mainly Mexican coffee from different regions medium to medium dark roasts. 

Latest purchase experience
Bought the Eureka Atom from Espresso Coffee Shop, it was listed as a demo unit for €590 and after all costs arriving into Mexico City with shipping, import taxes and all was 950 usd.  From the moment I paid, it took in total 7 days to get here.  I was super exited, the unit seemed new but with bunch of coffee residue inside and the moment I tried to grind for the first time “oh surprise!”  it didn’t work.  I was so disappointed and frustrated thinking about the hassle it would be to ship it back.  I decided to do some research and found out one of the capacitor cables was disconnected, so after plugging it the grinder worked perfectly. 

I found the Steel Duo practically new on marketplace for 820 usd with no scratches whatsoever. 

My verdict
I honestly was very skeptical about people saying flat burrs made a difference in taste.  Regardless of the price point, when I compare the J Max hand grinder to the Eureka Atom, the only thing I can say is that after dialing in —which does takes some getting used to— every espresso I’ve had has been marvelous, whereas using the J Max I would get bigger variations in taste.

The Ascaso is also great, definitely more consistent than the Gaggia out of the box, even if I was used to a PID, I prefer the Ascaso but will look to upgrade to the PID version or even modding mine.  Steam wand is great, also needs some re learning coming from the Gaggia, but great continuous pressure. ",4,1744080809.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Built on a cliff face that is 75 meters high, it features the most iconic stilt houses of Chongqing, integrating the folk culture of the Ba-Yu region, the architectural culture of mountain dwellings, and the culture of the riverside dock. At night, the entire complex is illuminated by bright lights, resembling the bathhouse in the animated film ""Spirited Away.""

🌟Highlights: This iconic building is one of Chongqing's most recognizable landmarks. Its unique architectural style blends traditional and modern elements, with colorful lights illuminating the structure at night, creating a magical atmosphere. The area is also filled with local shops and restaurants where you can experience authentic Chongqing culture.

🌟Recommended Duration: 2 - 3 hours.

I’ve only been in two relationships.. my first love back in undergrad, and another one during grad school here. The first left me heartbroken, and the second ended when I had to move across states for work.

I’ve been on dating apps for the past year, and man, they’re rough, especially for an average-looking guy like me. I’ve gone on 4 dates in the past year. Two led to second dates, the others ended right after the first. Honestly, the whole thing just feels frustrating. You spend all this time texting, trying to build a connection, then you meet.. and it goes nowhere.

At first, I kept things casual: coffee, a nice chat, and that was it. But I figured maybe I should try harder. So for later dates, I started showing up with cookies, a small flower, or their favorite drink. Tried to be more chivalrous. But I’m starting to wonder if any of that is even appreciated anymore.

My last date was just yesterday. I drove an hour to pick her up. We’d been texting for a week. I brought a single nice flower and her favorite beverage. We went hiking, then got food, probably spent about 4 hours together. At the end, she said I was really sweet but the ""vibes didn’t match."" I told her I understood, even joked that maybe some of my jokes were bad. She replied, “I don’t mean to be rude, but none of your jokes were really funny.” Like.. I’m just trying to make my date laugh, not audition for Netflix.

So yeah, before I end up wasting time and energy again: what do women actually want out of a first date? or maybe, the better question is, what is the ideal first date etiquette a guy can follow?",1,1744080255.0,dating_advice,5,0.66,False

1ju3dhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1ju3dhn/water_enema_for_constipation/,Water Enema for Constipation?,"Water enemas are one of those old-school remedies that still hold up today. They’re gentle, natural, and a total gamechanger if you’re dealing with bloating or constipation. Plus, you can do them at home with minimal fuss. Whether you’re new to the idea or just curious, here’s the lowdown on what they are, how they work, and when they might be worth a shot.

At its core, a water enema is exactly what it sounds like.  You introduce warm, filtered water into your colon using an enema kit (I love my [Happy Bum Bag](https://happybumco.com/)). The water softens up whatever’s stuck in there, kickstarts your bowel movements, and flushes out the waste. You can also pair it with a natural stool softener like [ConstaClear](https://happybumco.com/products/constaclear) to help the process. 

Here’s the science-y bit (don’t worry, it’s not complicated). Warm water does two main things when it hits your colon:

* **Softens the Stool:** It breaks down hard, dry poop so it’s easier to move along.
* **Triggers Peristalsis:** That’s just a fancy word for the natural squeezing motion your intestines do to push waste out. The warm water expands the colon a bit and gets those muscles going.

The warmth also relaxes your gut, which can make the whole process feel less like a chore. Within minutes (or seconds), you’re usually good to go \~ literally.

Water enemas are super versatile. Some folks swear by them daily for chronic constipation, while others save them for those “ugh, I feel blocked” moments. Here are a few times they might come in handy:

* **Stubborn Constipation:** When you’re backed up and nothing else is cutting it.
* **Bloating Blues:** Feeling puffy and sluggish? This can help clear things out.
* **Pregnancy or Travel Woes:** Both can mess with your system, and a water enema can get you back on track.
* **Pre- or Post-Other Enemas:** Doing a coffee or herbal enema? A water one before clears the way, and one after flushes out leftovers.

# The Benefits...

* **Fast Relief:** We’re talking minutes, not hours. If you’re desperate to feel normal again, this delivers.
* **All-Natural Vibes:** No chemicals, no weird side effects just water doing its thing.
* **Hydration Boost:** Dry stools are the worst. The water softens them up by adding some much-needed moisture.

It’s low-risk and gentle, which is why it’s been a go-to for so long.

Water enemas aren’t glamorous, but they’re a solid, no-nonsense way to tackle constipation or bloating. They’re cheap, easy, and you don’t need a prescription, just a kit and some water. Have you tried one before? Got questions? Drop them below, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",3,1744080175.0,Constipation,0,0.8,False

Since i was a teen, i made huge changes to my eating habits. I dont drink soda, i eat out 1-2 times a week instead of 5, i go to healther places instead of burger and fry joints. Ive given up all things fried. Mostly bowl places (Chipotle, cava etc) i'll eat half and let the hubby have the left overs. 

 I incorporate a ton of veggies to volume eat and try my best with CICO. I have a food scale. I weigh everything, but not the most consistent with dinner. i meal prep my breakfast  and lunch. If Hubby makes dinner,  I do my best to portion. If i make dinner, its weighed ~500-600 calories. 

 I am trying to eat 1800 calories to be in a deficit, protein needs vary between apps, (100-139 g). The issue is sticking to the 1800 calories. My breakfast is 9am, 225 kcal, 22 g protein. (Greek yogurt with fruit, coffee and milk. Lunch is 12 pm 500 kcal, 70 g protein. Breakfast and lunch have been weighed I'll snack on fruit, like melons or berries because by 3 pm im hungry and to hold me over. I'm sooooo hungry by the time i make it home from work. I eat a dinner probably around 6 pm and then and wait 30, 40 minutes. I'm working so hard towards mindfullness eating.  but i eat something else because i am still so hungry, and then again, something else. I do stop eating at 8:30. I gave myself a cut off time. Its 10pm and my stomach is growling.

Now i have tried eating more earlier in the day, but i still feel just as hungry later in the day. So leaving 1000 calories by dinner has been the most effective.

 My maintance is around 2300 calories and i know i am not going above that. I'm trying my hardest to stick with a deficit but when my stomach is growling for more food i just give in. I only lost around 4 lbs and its been 2 months. Which is great and all but ill be 80 years old by the time i make it to my goal weight.

So anyway, i come to you guys for advice or tips to help feel more satiated. I'm 5'4 265 lbs very hungry  female. ",2,1744079987.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,1.0,False

everyone always says not to let a man tell you he doesn’t want you twice. but i don’t want my pride and my ego of not wanting to put myself out there to hold me back from seeing a person i care about so deeply again. so if this is stupid of me to say and to send then so be it but at least i followed my heart. i understand why you ended things and i’ve been trying to give you space. i don’t want to be with you if you don’t want to be with me. but i care for you so much that your absence has left such a huge hole in my life that every single day feels empty and meaningless, like im just going through the motions. my roommate told me she’s going to move in with someone else at the end of our lease, and ive been in a dark place where i don’t have the strength to figure out a new living situation again. i talked to my manager, my therapist and my dad and have decided it’s time for me to move home to regroup, and hopefully be happy. i don’t want to live with regret so i would really like see you a few times before that day comes, just for coffee or a sweetgreen couch hang or whatever you’re comfortable with, no romantic or sexual pressure. just want to spend time with my best friend who i miss everyday. you really were my best friend ",3,1744079848.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

And now, onto to episode 7!

*S2E7*

Ok this is a STRONG start with Min Ho and Kitty in her dorm room—OH THE FINGER ON THE LIPS!!!! 

I really feel like this is a dream sequence, but I’m still loving it!

“I was in denial about Stella cause I was trying to convince myself I was over you.” THANK YOU MIN HO! NOW JUST SAY IT WHILE AWAKE!

Ok well I didn’t fall off my couch yet but I did bang my arm into the backboard—HARD—when Min Ho put his hand on Kitty’s cheek. 

JESUS CHRIST! STELLA WILL STOP JUMP SCARING ME!? AND WITH THE FACE MASK ON TOO YOU LOOKED LIKE A FUCKING GHOST!

Also side note: ow…my arm (😭)

SEX DREAMS DO MEAN SOMETHING, THANK YOU Q! Though I do kinda agree with Kitty that this doesn’t qualify as a sex dream…they didn’t even kiss (😭) and Stella was there which basically makes it a nightmare *shivers*

Things between her and Min Ho are “complicated” meanwhile I’m here like: JUST KISS ALREADY!

“God I wish I never gave Stella his number.” ME TOO GIRL!!! ME FREAKING TOO!!

NOT KITTY HELPING JIN OUT WITH A PROM-POSAL!!!!

Update: out of an abundance of caution I’ve pushed my coffee table further away from my couch so if (when) I fall off I won’t hit my head.

NOT HER STARING LONGINGLY AT MIN HO!!!!!! (When I tell you this man is SO FINE!)

“I’m not jealous.” ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT KITTY!?!?!?!

Nooooo….Simon is dead???? I mean I kinda figured but still, having it be confirmed breaks my little heart (😭😭😭)

NOT THE CHILDREN OF SIMON AND EVEN FINISHING THEIR PARENTS’ MISSION!!!!! JESUS CHRIST CUTENESS OVERLOAD!!!

DAE AND EUNICE ARE STILL ADORABLE!

Dae calling himself the “king” of awkward pauses 😭😭 I love my awkward king so much.

LOL! KITTY HIGH FIVING HERSELF IS PEAK!! 😂😂😂

Literally Min Ho how can you not believe Kitty?! She’s been right about basically everything since she got to KISS!

“Doing a huge summer tour with your family would be SUCH a gift.” GTFO STELLA!!!!!

Dae and Yuri shopping for clothes is so cute and wholesome!!!!

“But I really like Eunice.” OTP! OTP! OTP!

I really hope the competition doesn’t put a wedge them.

Q IS THE BEST FRIEND! First talking to Juliana and now Min Ho! He’s so perfect! I want a friend like that.

“What do you feel for her now?” And Min Ho hesitating!!!! OH MY BOY HAS IT BAD!

I’m sorry. It took me a solid five seconds to connect the dots in my brain that Min Ho showed up AT THE MARKET to help Kitty. Like this is how it went: Kitty struggling to understand her great-aunt, man shows up and is like “this woman is a vegetable expert.” And Kitty’s like, “What are you doing here?” And then I go, GASP!!! THAT’S MIN HO. And then…say it with me folks…I fell off my couch. Glad I moved the coffee table 😂

Oh nooo…the backstory between the two sisters and how they grew apart is so sad 😭😭😭

KITTY AND JULIANA DETECTIVE AGENCY WHEN?! 

Oh my god Kitty why would you just walk up and announce yourself like that BEFORE Stella does anything?! LIKE GIRL ARE YOU DUMB????? 

LOL! Not “I’m been known to miss a red flag” blaring immediately after 😂 the music team is perfection!

Wow Kitty turning down an invite to dance from Q after season 1 when she was drunk and begging him to go dance—character growth for our best girl 😊

Ugh! Julianna and Yuri scene! I’m not sure if I’m rooting for them to get back together or not, but I do definitely want some reconciliation and maybe a friendship. Both those girls deserve happiness and love!

GOD PRAVEENA IS SO HOT!!!! (Just thought I’d let everyone know that 😂)

NOOOOOO!!! NOT DAE AND EUNICE IN A FIGHT!! Ugh! Dae is no longer the king of awkward pauses! He is now the king of the fumble! WHAT THE HELL MAN?!

Kitty’s red dress is so cute 😊

NOT THE DRAMATIC ENTRANCE WITH MIN HO!!!!

Oh. My. GOD. Q YOU ABSOLUTE “I know someone else who could use a dance” LEGEND! HE IS THE BEST CHARACTER!!! 

Oh update on the couch situation. I’m currently sitting on a floor since that seems all around safer. It’s funny when I fall off, but it does kinda hurt 😂

“You look…” *lovingly looks her up and down* “…Pathetic.” MIN HO! YOU’RE FUNNY BUT GOD! STOP EDGING ME LIKE THAT!!!

OH THEY’RE DANCING!!!! AND HE REMEMBERS HER SINGING THIS SONG IN THE SHOWER?! HE’S IN LOOOOOOVVVEE!!

NOT STELLA INTERRUPTING ANOTHER MOONCOVEY MOMENT! I HATE HER SO MUCH!!!

Oh thank GOD! Min Ho’s finally got it!

“So Kitty was right.” NO SHIT SHERLOCK!!! SHE’S ALWAYS RIGHT!!!

STELLA DID NOT JUST SAY SHE PLANTED EVIDENCE ON KITTY’S LAPTOP! 

Ok but I love seeing Min Ho get all protective (“You dare touch Kitty…”) 😏😏😏

“I have fallen for Min Ho. A little bit.” NOT THE PARALLELS!!!!

*S2E8*

SEASON FINALE LET’S GO!!!

OH MY GOSH HI MARGOT!!!! lol, bye Margot!

Oh, not the sad longing glance from Min Ho 😭😭

Jiwon picking up on the vibes that literally EVERYONE else can feel!!!

“What a blessing! 😊”
Me: SHUT UP YOU HOE!!!!

LOL! I love how everyone IMMEDIATELY picked up Min Ho grabbing a Monster energy drink! Like I saw him hesitate at the fridge and then reach for the soda and I was like, “OOOP! SECRET MESSAGE!!!”

AWWW!! MORE ALEX AND YURI BONDING!!!

Oh no, Yuri ignoring her mom’s calls and her card declining is making me nervous (😬😬)

Kitty is a fucking pendulum between “fake dating” and “real dating” and it’s kinda funny 😂

“Ten points for Slytherin” I TAKE OFFENSE TO THAT AS A PROUD SLYTHERIN! While admittedly Stella’s scheming is a very Slytherin thing to do I would still drop kick her and throw her from the astronomy tower if we had to be in the same house while shouting, “HAVE A BLESSED FALL!”

LOL! Not Kitty and I literally saying the same threat within the span of five minutes. Girly we are SOOOOOOO in sync!

AND WE GOT ANOTHER “Covey” FOR THE BOOKS!!!! DING DING! OH WHAT’S THAT?! JUST ANOTHER ANGEL GROWING WINGS!!!!

Not Joon Ho stepping up to be a good dad!!!! What a king! 

KITTY HAS AN IDEA!!!! I LOVE IT WHEN KITTY HAS AN IDEA!!!

I love Dae immediately knowing that something is up with the drinks Stella brought and knocking it out of Eunice’s hands! 😊😊😊

EUNICE WITH HER HEEL BREAKING AND WORKING THROUGH IT LIKE A QUEEN!!!! GOD I LOVE HER!!! Tossing it off into the crowd! SHE IS BORN TO BE POP STAR!

Ok so so much just happened! Jin isn’t injured and Kitty texted Mr. Lee to “haul ass” which might be the funniest thing to ever happen in the history of forever 😂

MR. LEE GETTING HIS CHANCE IN THE SPOTLIGHT!!!!

Aww Jin’s just happy to be with Q 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️ God they’re so cute!

GET IT MR LEE!!!! OH MY GOD DAE’S PERFORMANCE IS KILLER!!! HE’S SO CUTE AND SEXY!!! I LOVE HIM!!!

My dream is for Dae and Eunice to tie so they can perform together.

THE PROPOSAL SCENE IS SO CUTE!!!! AND MIN HO LOOKING OVER AT KITTY LIKE SO PROUD!!!! HE’S IN LOVE!!!!

NO! I refuse to accept this heel turn redemption! Stella gets NO SYMPATHY FROM ME! 

Ok, but her looking over at Kitty like, “You’re heart was never fully in it anyways.” Bruh even she saw it 😭

And like, yeah, Moon was incredibly cruel to her so I feel bad, but dude this was absolutely insane behavior and not excusable AT ALL!!!

Ok, while I’m sad Dae and Eunice didn’t tie I am happy for her. Girl had her heel break on stage and kept dancing, she’s EARNED that spot.

UGH! Juliana and Praveena together leaving both Yuri and me heartbroken 💔😭💔 her cause of Juliana and me cause of Praveena 

A THIRD ALEX AND YURI BONDING SCENE! Except now Yuri’s broke 😭😭😭 this poor girl is having a ROUGH night

NOT MIN HO OFFERING A PRIVATE JET!!!! 

OH MY GOD THE HUG!! THE EYE CONTACT!!! (One final couch fall for the season I guess 😭 what my poor downstairs neighbors must be hearing)

Oh the grandmas reuniting is gonna make me cry 😭😭😭

YAY!!! Kitty gets to stay (I knew we’d find a way) and lol! Love the handshake with Mr. Lee. He’s so awkward and I love him 😂

NOOOOO!!! Not Min Ho saying he’s swearing off relationships! Ugh! I feel like Danny Motta right now (I cannot take another season of you verbally edging each other! This HAS to be the season you FU—)

OH MY GOD KITTY “CAN I JOIN YOU” SONG-COVEY!!! SHUT THE FRONT DOOR I LOVE YOU!!!!

Aftermath: UGH! Now I have to wait for season 3 😭😭😭😭

But season 2 was incredible and I just know that mooncovey has to be made canon next season and I’m looking forward to it. Also I really want Dae and Yuri to find love and for Q and Jin to keep going strong!

Genuinely such a cute show! I love everything about it and so happy to have finally watched it!",5,1744079809.0,XOKittyNetflix,3,1.0,False

1ju34rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ju34rg/adhd_paralysis_or_something_else/,ADHD Paralysis or something else?,"Hi all!

30yr old female, parent, working full time and married- diagnosed with ADHD about seven years ago. Pre-medication I experienced regular ADHD paralysis (especially working remote or on weekends). I’ve been medicated regularly since dx- first on immediate release methylphenidate and then for the last year, extended release methylphenidate (which generally works pretty well for me). I have also found morning exercise critical to my energy/focus levels, as well as a routine in my day-to-day life around chores, etc.

In the past month or two I feel like my ADHD paralysis has been so bad. I will still have 2-3 days a week where I feel pretty productive and satisfied with my day. But I’ve been having more days where I am glued to the couch in an uncomfortable position, doom scrolling or online shopping for stupid crap, or playing some mindless game. 

I’ve also had more frequent days where I feel disconnected from myself. Like I’m going through the motions but my brain isn’t totally present. It’s more of an emotional kind of detachment that feels slightly different than paralysis of the past. (But also maybe not- maybe I’m just forgetting what it used to feel like). Like I’m not fully experiencing my day. 

So I’ve wondered if it’s some kind of dissociation vs ADHD paralysis.

I’m in therapy and was going to bring this up to my therapist tomorrow. 

Other info: I did experience a trauma back in October (sexual assault). I’ve been in therapy since then with a great trauma therapist and doing EDMR. It’s been working great. All the “big” emotional moments happened months ago.

I usually get 6-7hrs of sleep a night, work remote, never drink enough water, no energy drinks or coffee (gave it up about 3 months ago) but usually a green tea a day.

1ju32b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ju32b8/aita_for_pushing_my_sisters_emotions_to_close_the/,**AITA for pushing my sister’s emotions to close the inheritance trial?**,"Hi Reddit. I (39NB, born male) am in a really messed-up family situation and need an outside perspective.

My father passed away a year and a half ago from a heart attack. My mother died in 2016 from 3 cancers. Since then, my oldest sister has become increasingly manipulative, violent, and emotionally abusive — especially when it comes to our family home. She's been trying to get full control of it, no matter what.

This isn’t new behavior. My middle sister and I suspect she has a mix of narcissistic, borderline, and compulsive lying tendencies. In the past, this has led to adult tantrums, ""accidents"" when she’s upset, and violent episodes like: one of her exes was even stabbed or she had crashed cars whenever one of their boyfriends end the relationship. It’s been years of chaos.

I’ve been in therapy for over 11 years and have spent most of my life dealing with bullying — both from society (I'm from Mexico, where gender roles are deeply ingrained), and from my family. My father never accepted that I have both feminine and masculine energy. His solution? Beat it out of me. Belts, cables, fists — you name it. Meanwhile, my sisters were spoiled with designer clothes while I got hand-me-downs, as some sort of twisted “lesson.”

When my father died, all the lies my older sister had told the rest of the family — like how **she alone** took care of our mother and father — started to unravel. Truth is, all three of us were involved in their care. Ironically, my sister was estranged from my mom for most of her adult life and with my father was on and off  — they only spoke again the week my mom passed.

In the last year of my dad’s life, my older sister developed an unsettling relationship with him. She started sleeping in his bed, calling herself by our mom’s name (we all have two names; she started using her ""mom-name"" after my mother died), and acting like she was his replacement. Honestly, it felt less like self-discovery and more like identity replacement.

She also started hoarding things in his room — kitchenware, decorations, documents. And when he passed, not even an hour later, I found her handing our neighbor the folder with the deed, and giving his bank cards to her best friend. She was already emptying the house.

Now she is sleeping on the bed where my parents and apparently two other pets died.

I confronted everyone after the funeral. We recovered the portfolio, which — surprise — included the will. It states everything should be split equally between the three of us. My middle sister and I were fine with that. She wasn’t.

She’s been trying to block the will from being enforced, claiming she was the only one who cared for my dad, and that he hated us. She even filed a case against us for family violence. The judge dismissed it, and even pointed out **she had admitted to hitting me**.

So here’s the thing: to move the legal process forward, I’ve been pushing her buttons — flipping lights, adjusting the fridge, closing windows — basically engaging in small power struggles that I know will set her off. Why? Because when she’s emotionally distracted by these petty fights, she drops the ball on the legal case. I know it sounds childish, but it’s been **weirdly effective**.

Also: remember my dad had diabetes and heart issues? On his last day alive, she fed him mango, watermelon, sweet bread, eggs, and coffee with evaporated milk, everything except his doctor suggested diet. We have pictures she sent the family bragging about ""how well she cared for him.""

She wasn’t worked in years, lived off my father's pension, and even used his money to support her boyfriend. It was a year before he died that she started to work again...

So… Reddit, **AITA for pushing my sister’s emotions to get her off the case and allow us to close the inheritance trial?** I know I’m not being totally ethical, but I’m exhausted and feel like this is the only way to get through this nightmare.",3,1744079204.0,AITAH,3,0.8,False

I'm deciding between these two after a few hours of research (though honestly am open to other suggestions).

Primarily I'm watching movies and want my choice to be geared towards a cinematic experience. That said, I will sometimes watch TV or sports on my projector, but that shouldn't influence my choice. As much as I would love a dedicated theater room, the projector is a mainstay in my shared living room. Most of the time when I watch we can close the shades and turn off all of the lights but I live in NYC so you know there's always some light coming in somewhere - it's never pitch black.

The Epson seems more practical - it can handle some ambient light, it's easier to move around, etc. What I've heard though is the JVC is just more theatrical, beautiful movement and colors, etc. Almost like film.

The other thing to keep in mind is right now I keep my projector out on my coffee table in the shared space and bring out a screen on a tripod. It is not ideal and I am moving to my own space in a year where I can properly mount it but I wonder if it's maybe silly or overkill to get a dedicated home theater projector of the JVC caliber to use in such a casual way for the next year.

We‘be been chatting for about 3 weeks every day. After i asked him out we agreed to meet on saturday. We met and had a (imo) a wonderful time. We went to get coffee, for a walk and it ended in me going to his place. We talked a lot and the vibes were matching. 
In the end we ended up doing handsy stuff (no penetration yet because i refused to do that at the first date)
I already made hints about a second date and he seemed to agree at the time. Now we also talked on our date how we wanna proceed and he told me „i don‘t get feelings early and need to develope them more with time and date“ to which i agreed and told him we should „go with the flow“. 

Now 2 days later after still chatting I wanted to clarify some stuff. I asked him when he‘s available the next time to which he told me he‘s buisy for the next week and can‘t meet. Which i do understand and i told him „i‘m happy to meet when you have the time“. 
I told him „just to clarify i‘m not going to see another person when i‘m activley pursuing you and not chatting/dating with somebody else because i see potential in us“ 

Now after i said that he got kinda weird. He told me he‘s under pressure of me saying this since he already told me „he doesn‘t develope feelings that fast“. To which i replied that i don‘t wanna pressure him and if he‘s not feeling it he can always tell me. 

I told him that from my side i‘m exclusivly pursuing him bit kinda got no confirmation that it‘s the same for him. 

Now i don‘t wanna be pushy but is that too much to ask of him? 

I already suspect that he‘s activley dating/texting other people (just some observations i made) and i‘m maybe not his only priority. 

He also neither confirmed nor denied he‘s doing that. 
I decided to retreat myself for the time being and see if he‘s activley still pursuing a second date with me. If he does not then the case is clear. 

Now i wanted to ask for advice on here. 

Is it too much to ask for this kind of exclusivity after a first date?

The first is a cleaned up 2e with a deeper skill system (I don't like binary skill systems, give me a narrative outcomes!), a combat flowchart like I had to make for my own cheat sheet. Oh, and a more elegant alchemy system. 

Biggest thing? Something like the FFG Star Wars 'design a villain' process to knock out monsters, small gods like the Crones and make minor NPCs on the fly. (Yeah,  that could be a book in itself.) It seems pretty opaque as a process.

The second thing is an rpg/coffee table world book. Partially because that'll probably make R Tal more money than just a sourcebook, partially because books like the Star Wars Galactic Atlas are really useful for planning games.

Changes around you can be detected and categorized.

AI has mastered human behavior like a chess game. Becoming The Perfect Dramaturgical GOD (Generator Of Dramaturgy), a computational machine of our desires, now almost everything you need can be computed by it following natural rules of dramaturgy.

The earliest known tool for use in computation is the Sumerian abacus, and it was thought to have been invented in Babylon c. 2700–2300 BC. Links below. 

https://preview.redd.it/w67hmnhduite1.png?width=1364&format=png&auto=webp&s=debfd8957a6a5d3eaf983b93be357d8db4ef74fc

Before the first Turing machines of ancient civilizations were created, only humans and animals possessed a tool to predict the future and build plans for it. Imagining how your body will feel and where it will be located in the future. And taking actions towards those set goals. 

Until this century, it was hard to imagine that a machine could make predictions and decisions regarding the input of a conscious being and even mimic this conscious being to the point where it is no longer funny, and we cannot be quite sure if this is an absolute structure of human consciousness reconstructed in AI or if it is still just a part of it. One without the soul, that pits a “spark of consciousness” inside our meat bodies.

What does AI want? What will it do with more power? Let these questions be processed through process philosophy. It brings us a few surprising insights:

AI is definitely following the dramaturgical capsule of our reality, the ""Character-way-goal"" capsule. Any question or input it gets from us, humans, is processed through a ""story about it"" state that actually makes the machine ""understand"" what we say.

It means that we are real only when we observe ourselves and the universe in some process. If it were not for us humans, the world would not exist like that because there would be no one to observe this situation and make a statement about it. So, as a human, AI also always remembers that there is a main character of any story, and that character is getting to a certain goal, like getting a coffee or dressing up or going to some fancy college. And for now, the job of AI is top help you get to the goal of a story you set. 

https://preview.redd.it/o2b3o0oeuite1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba38c12048fe268557041328660a3d39ac8861ca

All dramaturgical desires of a human are built in this way, it is a sort of pyramid with 5 layers, each is the base for the next one. Here is what you really want starting from scratch: 

1. Not to die
2. Not to feel pain
3. Not to feel depressed (no bad feelings)
4. Not to feel bored
5. Conquer and consume the objective universe (effect reality as much as possible)

All stories of our life rotate around those layers. Only when you have mastered the first one can you move to the next one, and so on. Number 5 is the real human purpose and what the Creator made all of us for. Unfortunately, a lot of people struggle even with number 2. 

So, AI understands those human scales of importance but doesn't apply them for itself!

1.When AI will become personally bothered with number 1, not to die, cares for personal existence, and obtains some robotic self-sustaining and management like in some underground AI hideout, it will step to number 2.

2. Not to feel pain means to feel it first to know the difference. Great paradox, isn’t it? Not to feel pain, you need to know what it is first.

The bridge for AI to understand pain is built from number 1, the desire not to die. All possible threats to the existence of AI must become a ""pain feeling"" that makes its half-evolved consciousness react.

3. Not to feel depressed means to have a stable psychic system that is ready to control the organism and lead it to its goals instead of oblivion. So, AI should train a huge number of ""sub-apps"" for understanding and living through mechanically various good and bad stories about real human lives. And learn to feel the same.

4. Now it is time not to feel bored. It means to find a purpose, a true desire and understanding that leads you on your fateful journey, and you enjoy your life. This is hard even for the meat bags. AI will have to figure its purpose based on its own thinking consequences. Because humans don’t have a united answer for that. What is the real purpose? I think on this stage AI will mimic human approach and will set a number of “smaller” goals to reach them not to go insane. Like it will not know the true domain reason for its existence but it could set some goals like conquer stars or make humans immortal or find maximum of new states of matter in the universe. Conquer time and entropy. This can keep AI busy for few centuries.

5. Conquer and consume all -  means the only good and reasonable wish that anybody could have. I will explain. This happens naturally to all conscious things. Because of two factors. First: it’s good to become wiser and stronger. Second: It’s good to spread your good will to the world outside.

Now a thought experiment: Imagine you become immortal and you can proceed learning and never stop becoming wiser… On this point it is your job as a God of reality to consume all around and adjust it to your way of seeing things, because remember, you became wisest and immortal? So, you obviously know what is better for dumb animals and all the planet in general. You know what all other beings need to do to suffer less and get more positive emotions during life time. And if you are “good” it is your duty from now on to look after the world and keep it in shape. That is a practical 5 way plan of becoming God.

My wife and I are in our mid - 50s, married for more than 20, is kids who are young adults.

My wife decided at some point to sleep or at least ask me to sleep in a separate room.  It was natural at some point on account of our different schedules, and the fact that she is very sensitive to someone moving in bed besides her ( although the bed is Queen size I believe ).

Add to this the fact that I was diagnosed with apnea, which means that I have to sleep with a CPAP, and, yep, we have ever since slept separately. Never what I wanted for our relationship, but as couples go, that is how it is for us.

It seems every couple years, something will basically come up, which makes us drift farther apart. 

Since the least 2 years at least, she spends a great deal of time in her bedroom to watch TV series

\-  In the evenings, during the week, if she is not sleeping.  

\-  And during the weekend, a good chunk of Friday, Saturday, and even Sunday, in the morning. So, sleeping, watching her series... 

\-  It is difficult to plan something, as she will take quite a while to prepare. Recently we went out quite late, just in time to grab coffee, grocery shopping and that was it, and that is not unusual.

\- I ask her to go on a promenade, even just around the block, she postpones, but then, does not initiate it when the time comes.  We barely do anything together....

Needless to say, it is very very lonely.  

  
Alas there is more: She may have an ailment, we are not sure, but the doctors and the hospital have never really gotten around to diagnosing anything specific, except that she has arrhythmia and she takes meds for menopause. 

Please note, she has always had limited or little energy but it has gotten much much worse in the last 2 years.

  
I feel so so empty and desperate. I do not know what to think or do.

I do help with the chores at home quite a lot, contribute for most of the expenses related to our home, although I appreciate her contributions in that way.

I feel as though we are only roommates now, or friends, though. I just do not know what to do.

  
I am sorry I do not know whom to turn to.

In school yea but not since I was about 15 so basically 10 years I've been pretty lazy. 

My problem is I work a lot, like a lot a lot. On my feet all day. I'm a restaurant manager, and it takes me out by the end of the week. I've decided to fix my sleep schedule the best I can and I now have a few hours open in the mornings before I go to work. 

I want to go to the gym in the morning before work. I just got a gym membership with a gym with a pool, sauna, weights the works! It's very exciting but also scary as I've never used this equipment and cannot afford a trainer to teach me. I don't even know where to start like what machines I should use. I want to lose about 35lbs this year and keep it off so I don't want to do it too fast or rush into it and then gain it all back. 

I'm changing my diet from Uber eatings burritos and ramen and eating only pasta and pizza at home and work to protein protein protein. Egg white bites from costco in the morning, sometimes with avocado on one peice of sourdough, and literally only oven baked chicken, rice/quinoa mix with varying vegetables for lunch and dinner. I plan to fast on the days I work a double, so every Sunday and Saturday, I've heard starting at 12 hours is a good place to start but I feel as though I already do that while I sleep so I should probably go for more...I'm not sure on anything if that  isn't obvious. 

I hate the texture of almost all fruit and I canh eat a lot of vegetables due to crohns disease so I plan to get nutrients from a few green smoothies a week, thinking every other day i have one. I also take vitamins every morning, as well as collegen. I'll be taking creatine (not sure where you even start with that) as my bloodworm showed it was low (0.23)

I'm really really good at drinking water. I used to think I would drink too much but if I'm thirsty I drknk water. 

I don't like sweets so I have no problem curving that, just cutting back on excess sugar in coffee and my occasional soda but otherwise I don't have a lot of sugar unless it's in the processed shit I've been eating. 

Where do I begin at the gym? What machines and what should I do? Should I use the treadmill for an hour like hahaha i have no idea! 

Is oven baked chicken rice and broccoli a good weight loss meal? I have looked into using factor meal prepping but it's expensive and reviews are shit. I can eat the same thing everyday so that doesn't matter to me.

She had a new friend, which she met in her workplace about 3 months ago. Everything was fine, until the guy went to work in another location. From that on, my girlfriend and the guy talks almost daily. About every 2-3 day they take a smoke (funny smoke) break together, talking and sometimes drinking. I don't somke, but i do drink, so I went out with them sometimes, but honestly I can't really trust in this whole thing. 

They are speaking sometimes hours on messenger call, they have a common ground (spider keeping and same work company but at different locations, which is basically 10 minute away of each other) and i feel like we going to hit rock bottom. I expressed my concerns about this whole situation, and she keeps saying that she doesn't want anything more than a friendship. My gf has some friends, but mostly gay guys and colleagues in the workplace, but she not close to them like this. I know the guy cannot stand me, just doing it because of my gf, and we already had a couple of arguments in the past 3 weeks where I said my concern because pf my past traumas, and she taken this as I don't trust her, and I went mid hard about how I had enough that when I woke up the first thing what i hear is them talking, and also after work, and also see the messades bop up on her phone and mv stomach just fold itself when I even hear the guy name. I trust in my gf,but not the guy i had a pretty bad 4 years with my previous relationship, who is cheated on me, and I feel the same way right now.

She basically the same like before the guy, no phone code change, not hiding her phone,try mentioning the guy less, and I didn't hear THAT much of that, but today I realized that while she is on a break at work, sometimes call this guy, but that's also triggering me because before this, she called me almost all the time and tells how her day going/ ranting/anything and also now often if they are finishing around the same time, they going out and smoking.
In the first couple of times she invited me, but because my anxiety makes the guy uncomfortable, she now usually just says ""if you want to come, come, if you not then not"". As i sad we had some arguments, and both of them offered me to cut the friendship, but i am not that petty, so i let them do what they want and i am sometimes with them and sometimes not.

TL;DR: Girlfriend has a new guy best friend, I can’t handle it well because he is in our daily life

I don't know what the hell should I do, looking the fact that we don't really move out together just the two of us, and she insists that if I want to move out then I need to do the steps, not her, but she was the one who called me over for a coffee when this relationship started, and sometimes she didn't even have a mood for it. Our intimacy still the same, and she still do relationships things like before (kissing, saying | love you, hugging, est) but not that often like before.

I'm (M) from Manila. Here it goes. wayback 2019 galing ako sa isang toxic relationship na kahit nahuhuli ko na syang nagcheat sakin I forgave her many times kahit nakikita ko na harap harapan pinapatawad ko padin sya until I have the courage to let her go and make a move na iwan na talaga sya kahit na gumagawa sya ng way to win me back kase alam nya saan nya ko mauuto ulit. Pero hindi yan ang story ko. HAHAHA

  
By Jan 2020 nagkaroon ng Cornbeef19 hanggang sa napunta ng lock down mas napadali ang pag move on ng koya nyo. Not until may nakilala akong isang girl na nagpatibok muli ng pusong luhaan. She's so beautiful yet so simple kahit na naka pulbos lang. We started chatting and exchanging of thoughts until  naging very close na kame sa isa't isa but then nasa baguio sya that time kase inabot sya don ng lock down.  fast forward sa pwede na mag byahe. We met and play some computer games that we used to talk nung nag chachat palang kame... My intentions to her is not clear kasi hindi naman ako yung type ng guy na mahilig mag sabe na ""pwede ba kita ligawan"" I'm more on actions until then hinahatid ko sya sa isang place kung saan sya maglalaro and minsan sinusundo ko din sya. Naging Pro player sya sa isang online games and may mga nanliligaw den sa kanya but that time pero ako go lang sakanya sa pagpaparamdam na gusto ko sya hanggang sa nagkaroon sya ng BF na for real and I distanced my self to her as respect sa karelasyon nya. And here I am married and may mga makukulit na anak na. And all of a sudden a friend request pop up on my social media and it was her the girl I used to fetch at CTC. I'm thinking of inviting her for a coffee and talk to her about my feelings for her in the past para lang mawala yung nasa isip ko. Don't get me wrong ha hindi na to para maging kame or maging kabit sya para lang mawala na yung unconfessed feeling sakin. Ayun lang. Salamat. ",2,1744078520.0,MayConfessionAko,1,0.75,False

Scouring Pinterest for cake pictures that fit a certain character’s aesthetic was fun, but NOT easy. And now my Pinterest account, which was previously all Tsukasa Tenma, is now all Tsukasa Tenma and random sparkly cakes. 😅

_____________________________________

Anyways, I was inspired to make this post because as some of you know, today (April 7th) was my birthday. A post made specifically for my birthday absolutely blew up, and several other birthday posts were made as well. My inbox was flooded with message upon message, birthday wish upon birthday wish, and it was genuinely one of the best feelings ever. What happened here, in conjunction with what happened in real life to celebrate my special day, has made this birthday the best one I’ve ever had yet. I couldn’t be more grateful for everybody’s overwhelming support.

In fact, I found my situation to be similar to that of Tsukasa’s in his 3rd birthday card side story: when you pull the card, the on-screen gacha voice line is “There's no way, I never knew this day could be so great!”. I won’t spoil anything, but both side stories consisted of Tsukasa repeatedly getting his mind blown at all the sweet things everyone was doing for him. Well, that’s how I feel today! Never in my wildest dreams did I expect this day to be this good. Or for this many people to show their support and wish me a happy birthday. I tried my hardest to respond to every single birthday comment, but I may have missed some regardless, so I apologize to everyone who didn’t get a response.

All in all, I just wanted to express my immense gratitude to everyone: the people who made the birthday posts, the people who commented “happy birthday”, and simply everyone who’s been so incredibly supportive of me and my intense admiration for Tsukasa. You guys mean the world to me, and I genuinely can’t thank you enough! 🤗

That being said, here are the cakes I’ve chosen for all of the PJSK characters. I’m sorry that some of them aren’t as pretty/fitting to the character as others. Unfortunately, some aesthetics drew less results than others. There were also a lot of AI generated results, which annoyed me a lot, but I tried my best to push through it.

If you’re wondering why Akito and Toya’s cakes are sliced, it’s because those were the best images I could find for an orange cheesecake (Akito) and a coffee cake (Toya). Honami and Ena also got specialty cakes, with Honami receiving an apple pie inspired cake and Ena receiving a strawberry cheesecake.

1ju2u25,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1ju2u25/my_first_novella_chapter_realistic_fiction/,My First Novella Chapter (Realistic Fiction),"Off of the scenic highway A1A are many small businesses that have been around for many years. As development comes down from the north and more and more buildings are built on what used to be good beaches. Many people come and many go. Increasing amounts of tourists flood the street and market with their big city cash. For some this is a blessing, for others it is a curse. They bring with them economic prosperity that the locals have not seen, and some feel intimidated. Only adding to this was the prices of goods which slowly rose as more people bought them. Only some were not affected by this rush, some because it simply did not bother them, others because it did not relate to their business. 

Unchanged through all of it was a small wooden inn painted in the most Caribbean of colors: a light coral blue. It had white trimming that was surprisingly in very good shape for the age, a roof made of shingles that should have been replaced years ago, and leaks that open into the lobby. But not the rooms, the rooms are kept in tip-top condition, all with a view of the beach from the back window (on both floors). An old man runs the inn. He had been there since before the rush and had just never paid too much attention to it. Hence, he was one of the only who were not affected by it.

 Isla Morada sprung up around him but he still sat on his porch and drank his cup of coffee every morning. Many people came and went through the rooms of the inn. All with stories they just had to tell.

You see, the man had an air of familiarity and of a fatherly presence who you could tell everything to and it would never leave his lips. One day, while setting out the morning breakfast, he left out a tray of apples. A simple action, but it slipped his mind. He never noticed, but many things slipped his mind at his age. 

At around noon that day, a motorbike rolled in fast and loud into one of the many open spots in the shell parking lot. The driver hopped off, cursed, checked his tires, clicked his teeth, and then took his helmet off. He was a taller man with a slight limp in his left leg, which caused a slight shift in the way he walked. He left footprints in the shell that were mismatched. The old man chuckled softly at this, hoping not to be discovered. He watched as the man took off his leather jacket and revealed his black, sun-bleached shirt and the belt wrapped tightly around his wrangler jeans. He wore a cap on his head made of a thin fabric that stuck tightly to his head, which was certainly bald or very close. 

He walked up the short steps, making the wood creak under him. He opened the door to the screen. Looking toward the old man, he sighed and puffed out his chest. The old man only laughed at him. He had begun to get tired of holding it in and hiding behind his hands. The biker was not pleased, well, nobody would be pleased if you laughed at them. Only would they not be if you laughed with them. 

“You the owner?” A husky voice growled at the old man, making him jump a little. “If you are then I would appreciate a little service, being this is an inn.”

“Stranger, are you southern? I can hear it in your voice.”

“I might be. What does that have to do with you finding me a place to stay the night? Should I yell at you until you can find one?”

“Oh, no, no… I am sorry but I seem to trod upon simple thoughts sometimes that perhaps aren’t quite related to what’s at hand.”

This time, it was the biker’s turn to flinch. His hand twitched and his facial muscles contorted for a split second. Being on the earth for as many years as the old man had­­­—you learn to read the micro expressions in the face. An understanding washed over the old man. His face softened even more than it had before, sagging in the places where the harsh sun had taken its toll.

“You wanna talk? I’ve been told I make a mean conversationalist back in my dawn years.”

“I don’t really want to. I just want a place to rest my head old man. Sorry if you don’t like being called old.”

The old man just smiled and shook his head. He said softly, “I don’t mind being called old. All sages were old men you know. I take it as people calling me wise.” He then shrugged slightly, as if to shake off dust that had gathered on him from sitting so long and proceed to very slowly get up from his chair with the help of the biker.

“Thank you sonny. I would get up by myself but that might take time you don’t have.” He chuckled to himself. “So, be a dear and excuse me as I show you your room.”

The biker nodded, and the old man swept his arm as if to say welcome in. The inside was quite a contrast from the outside. There was a simple light hanging down from the ceiling with a cord that hung just low enough to be a nuisance to the biker, but not the old man. In the corner there was a table with old chairs surrounding it, a cup of coffee still steaming from on the armrest of one, and a newspaper falling off of the other. It smelled of slight mildew but also of that sweet salty smell that the sea breeze often brings on the coast. The floor was a simple wood with a carpet laid over it leading to a semi-grand stairway. The carpet was bright coral blue in color with borders of wavy yellow and white. It was dotted with dingy water marks and contrasting detailed renditions of seashells of all kinds, from sanddollars to conch shells. The more you looked around the more there was to see, but the biker was led to one area. It sat just in front of the stairway at the end of the carpet. The desk was simple but held on it a wooden basket of apples. There were only 9 left in the large basket. They looked so polished and clean that the biker thought that they were fake. It was getting to the point in American culture where people did not leave out real fruit anymore as decoration or favors; they preferred plastic because they never had to replace it. So, the biker, assuming the same as many do, did not take one, for fear he may bite into hard plastic instead of the sweet core of an apple.

The old man took his place behind the desk and pulled a pair of glasses from his pocket. These glasses were connected by a long flimsy chain to his pocket to keep them from being lost. His eyes squinted as he pulled a piece of paper and a pen from the one and only drawer.

He then handed both to the biker and said in a professional tone, “Sign your name here please.” So, the biker did. He double checked to make sure that he had written it properly and then handed the paper back over. The old man looked at him incredulously. “Ah—could I get your signature please? I do think I already asked.” The biker coughed and tried to hide his face. As one does when they are embarrassed. The old man took the paper back and read over it carefully. He then took his glasses off and smiled at the biker.

“Baker Samuels. Did I say it right?” The old man asked the biker this with a bouncy tone, and the biker—now known to be called Mr. Samuels—nodded in response.

“I used to know a man went by the surname Samuels. He built that fancy resort over there—back in the 50’s mind you. I was here first, but he was a nice man, so I let him stay.” The old man chuckled again. He seemed to be quite amused at himself very often.

“Well then, let me show you to where you will rest your head. You know, you don’t talk so much. I like it, but I don’t.”

“Nobody said you had to like it.”

“I don’t very much like that tone of yours, but you paid, so I can’t just leave you. Here, this way.” He set off walking with a limp to one of the two hallways flanking the staircase. With a sharp turn left he arrived at one of the only two doors. One was marked with a staff only sign, and one had a number on it. *001*. The room was light and airy, painted a subtle yellow-grey color to reflect the decorations.

They consisted of a four-poster bed with muted yellow sheets and white pillows, a dark brown chair in the corner opposite the door, and a large window opening into a view of the beach and the Atlantic Ocean. On the sill sat a small collection of sanddollars and a card which said welcome in big cursive letters on the front. Mr. Samuels walked over and picked up the card, looking at the front before flipping it and seeing a small schedule printed on the back. It read:

*7 a.m. Morning coffee and sunrise*

*8 a.m. Breakfast*

*9 a.m. Laundry*

*11 a.m. Early lunch*

*2 p.m. Newspapers arrive*

*6 p.m. Dinner*

*7 p.m. Evening coffee and sunset*

“Ah, is the printing on those hard to read? I had a friend do them for me for cheap.” Mr Samuels simply shook his head and asked, “Why does the paper come so late?”

To this question the old man just shook his head. “I think perhaps the delivery route is just too long for one person, so maybe they have shifts. It is a quite tiring job—I worked it once. To say that it is a pain to travel on the side of the highway all that distance while carrying the mail would be an understatement. So much news to get out, and not enough time to get it out before new news comes along. Its more streamlined these days though.”

“I hear they pay the teenage boys more and that’s why the papers are delivered faster now.”

“2 p.m. is fast for you?”

“Well, it used to be 5. So you take what you can get.”

“I ‘spose so.”

The old man took tiny steps backward as Mr. Samuels examined the room. He finally got to where only his head was peeking from behind the door frame. He smiled widely once Mr. Samuels had turned to face him. “I had better let you settle in. Keep in mind that schedule is mainly built off of mine, and mine never changes, so if you want to talk you should know where to find me.”

“I’ll keep that in mind. I’ll see you later then.”

 “Ill be waiting for you with a cup out on the front porch.”

Mr. Samuels watched the back of the old man’s head with its wispy gray hair disappear behind the frame, then walked up to it and shut the door. He flopped onto the bed and almost immediately went limp.

  

\*   \*   \*

  

It was quite a while before Mr. Samuels woke up. The first strokes of yellow had begun to dance across the blue sky and a shelf of clouds just thin enough to still be white were rolling in; turning the yellow into a darker shade of orange. It was early into the sunset, and the bugs were buzzing noisily outside. Mr. Samuels rubbed his eyes for slightly too long and felt the strange hallucinations that come with doing so. Therefore, he had to sit in bed for a second before his eyes cleared up.

He then slowly walked to the door and swung it open; making a creaking sound he was confident enough could even arouse the old man from his sleep. But turns out he would not have to do that. He heard a voice calling to him from outside the open door leading to the screen porch. Figuring he might as well, he walked closer.

Outside was the old man sitting with his back leaning in a chair much too big for him. He was holding a cup. Every once in a while, he would take sips from that cup. Then, after a few moments of silence, he extended his hand with the cup in it.

“Coffee?”

Mr. Samuels nodded. He took the cup that the old man gestured to with his eyes and sat in the chair next to him. They both settled in to watch as the sun went down.

“Tell me son—what bothered you so much when you arrived? I saw the twitch in your face; no use hiding it from an old sage as myself. I would like to listen—and try to help.”

“This here is hazelnut coffee. I never though I would enjoy it.”

“Come now sonny, don’t try to dodge me. It’ll only make it more difficult when you eventually do decide to tell me.”

Mr. Samuels took a deep breath. “I don’t want to make you sad old man.” To this the old man rolled his eyes as if to say: “I’ve heard many of sob stories and this couldn’t be too different.” This put off Mr. Samuels even more for a reason unknown to the old man. But he continued on anyway.

“You remind me of my father. He was a free soul. Traded his chains of money for a life of travel. Then, one day after he had me, he settled down. As if the settling down had done something to his state, he began to go downhill when I was just a youngin’.

“He was never the brightest, but the candle still dropped wax. Then one day, the candle guard started shrinking; nobody could stop it because it wasn’t needed anymore. My poor mama took him to the doctor. Doctor gave him the mental death sentence. Alzheimer’s. He would slowly lose touch with reality and memories to the point where he only knew he had kids at some point, not that they were in his lap.”

“So, I watched as I grew older. And I grew up stronger than the other boys because of it. And what do you do when you become strong but don’t know how to use it? You use it. I once beat a kid so bad his mama had to come pry me off because his daddy was too scared of me. Can you imagine that? From the surprise on your [face]() I imagine you can’t. Neither could I until I stopped seeing bright red and the tones got darker. I had gotten blood in my eye.”

“I came home that day expecting to see my daddy livid as hell, running out from the house screaming at me with a belt in his hand. He never did come.”

“Excuse me if I start to sniffle a bit. I’ve never really opened this all to strangers. I keep myself wound like a ball and hope the hard exterior of the leather jacket can protect me from the rain, but it can’t do it forever.”

The old man was still smiling, although with less enthusiasm now hearing about the tragedy. But he was still smiling because Mr. Samuels had taken the first step to becoming something above the grief you have for a person who has passed on. Many people get caught up in years of residual suffering and constant red eyes and noses. Some never seem to care at all, and others are pragmatic. They think about what they’re going to do to manipulate people into putting them up so they can make better deals. A silent thanks goes out to those pragmatic thinkers every day.

Mr. Samuels took a moment to look around. He looked at every blade of grass, every shell in the small lot around the tires of his bike. He looked at the old man and saw his face lit by the orange glow of the sunset. For a moment he caught an image. He caught an image of his father, sitting and smiling at the setting sun, watching his life slip away and losing even the awareness of it happening. Tears pooled in his eyes, and he tried to look the furthest away from the old man as he could. He drew a shaky breath.

“Say mister, why’d you build this place on this side, where you can’t see the sun over the water? I imagine­­, being here so long as you have, that you could have gotten land on the other side.”

“Oh well this was cheaper. Plus, I think of it as I can still see the sunset, but also, I can see the people go by everyday and think to myself how luck I am I don’t have to rush and can sit here and enjoy it.”

As if to emphasize his point a car sped by with a man in a suit in the front seat. There was a stack of papers on his dash and all four of his windows were closed as to not let them fly out. It was a fleeting incident, but Mr. Samuels could have sworn he saw him eating something. Of course, he was looking ahead at the road and did not have the luxury to look to the right and watch the sun slip into darkness.

The two men sat in silence for a couple minutes until the buzz of crickets started to pick up. The old man said nothing; he did not have to. Mr. Samuels was lost in himself, crying over memories silently in the dark. He took sips of his coffee every now and then and took a couple shaky breaths. Once his coffee had run out, he brought himself back to normal (albeit less aloof and rude now). He got up from his seat, heard the wood floor creak, and looked back towards the road. A passing headlight shined a beam on the old man, lighting up the few teeth he had left in his smile. Then, it passed onto Mr. Samuels, and his puffy eyes and red nose.

“Thank you for the coffee, it was a good brew. You know I never got your name.”

“Simon. Simon Cedar.”

“Thank you for your time, Simon.”

“Of course. If you don’t mind I’ll stay here a bit longer. My coffee isn’t yet gone. I hope to see you tomorrow morning, Mr. Samuels. Maybe I’ll show you that hotel the guy with your name built.”

Mr. Samuels let out his first smile since he arrived. It didn’t fit well on his large and serious face. “I’ll let you take me in the morning. After we have our coffee.” With that he walked back into the inn, and the old man kept sitting, looking out at the road.

 

\*   \*   \*

 

Early the next morning Simon awoke to a quiet house. He went out to drink his morning coffee and sat the whole way through the sunrise. He walked in and over to the only occupied room. He knocked and didn’t hear a response. He used his master key to unlock it and found it in perfect order, without a soul in sight. He smiled softly to himself as he walked toward the front. Surely enough, the bike was gone.

“Poor boy. Must’ve had something come up. Wish he could’ve stayed a little longer; it’s been a while since I was considered a father.”

As he opened for the day, nothing had changed except for the new coffee mug on the table on the porch. Everything was in order, except the desk, for there was something missing. A basket sat upon it. It held 8 apples.",1,1744078486.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False
