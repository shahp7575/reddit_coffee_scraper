i am a graduating architecture student and lately i have been self-conscious about my weight and i need to lose some before graduation begins. i have been trying calorie deficit last June and it worked at first, then school started, and my cravings got stronger because of the availability of sweets and coffee.

i know that i‚Äôm lacking discipline in controlling my cravings, grief and depression taking toll on my emotional state which impacted my exercise schedule. i‚Äôd like to believe its also my fault for not mitigating my cravings and eating beyond my calories.

any tips on how do i mitigate my cravings and not eat beyond my calorie intake? all advices and tips are welcome.

1fwkmfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fwkmfv/am_i_the_asshole_for_telling_off_a_woman_who/,Am I the asshole for telling off a woman who insinuated I was dumping trash?,"I live in a major US city, in what is considered one of the nicer neighborhoods.  Aside from the cost of rent, one of the drawbacks is I have to walk around my block into the alleyway, which is exclusively for parking and trash cans.  It‚Äôs not the shortest walk but is only a weekly occurrence if my trash doesn‚Äôt start to smell.

I‚Äôve lived here for a bit over a year and haven‚Äôt had anything but pleasant interactions with anyone here, but I will admit, I‚Äôm pretty introverted and tend to avoid interacting with people outside of my social circle, which I suppose is what brings me to this post.

It‚Äôs about noon, a few hours before I‚Äôm scheduled to work, and I decide to do my weekly trash trip and then take a walk up to my grocery store.  I have a full trash bag, a paper shopping bag with glass, beer and soda cans for recycling, reusable shopping bags,  and a pizza box tucked in my pit.  My arms are full, I pushed this trip too far out, but I need to make it work or it‚Äôs going to fester until I get home and I won‚Äôt want to do it in the dark.  To top it off, I‚Äôm annoyed about a passive aggressive teams message I‚Äôve just read regarding one of my colleagues forgetting to wash a coffee cup.  

I cut the corner around my block.  It‚Äôs a mild sunny day and I‚Äôm starting to feel a bit better that I can enjoy a few hours of it after my errands and before heading to work.

Unfortunately, I did not see the middle aged woman walking towards me until she decided to question me.

‚ÄúAre you dumping that in the alley?‚Äù She asks

The annoyance washes back over me.  I have to snap back into the real world, and come to the realization that yes, she is addressing me.  While it is a problem in my neighborhood with people dumping trash and their dog crap, I‚Äôm not doing anything that would indicate that I‚Äôm doing what I feel she is accusing me of.  My building does not have direct access to the alley that I can use.  Neither do the buildings on either side of mine.

I briefly make eye contact through my sunglasses, muttering a quiet but irritated ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and keep walking.

Apparently this isn‚Äôt good enough for her.  She turns and begins to follow me

‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs not fair to leave that for those of us‚Ä¶‚Äù

And that‚Äôs enough for me.  I‚Äôm struggling to juggle the flattened pizza box, this trash bag that is defying the laws of physics, and the thing that I drop is my last bit of patience.

I‚Äôm not yelling, but my tone and volume is carrying a clear message.

‚ÄúAnd I fucking live here‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù  she‚Äôs surprised at my response, every ounce of confrontational energy she had when approaching me is gone

‚ÄúI‚Äôm walking to my trash cans.  Is that alright with you?‚Äù  

I don‚Äôt wait for her to respond.  Her arms are up and she takes a step back as I‚Äôm resuming my original course

‚ÄúI apologize‚Äù is all I hear from her as I keep walking. 

‚ÄúUnreal‚Äù I say clear enough, intending for her to hear.

I drop off my trash and get to the grocery store where I just can‚Äôt shake how annoyed I am.  I end up leaving with less than held of what I intended to get, and decide to grab a coffee and go home to play some video games.  I‚Äôve now long cooled off, but this being the first negative interaction I‚Äôve had in my neighborhood, I‚Äôve played it over and over in my head.

She was my mother figure back then kase she‚Äôs the eldest in our circle and very motherly ang kilos. I told her the expenses were all on me. 

When we had our orders‚Äìcoffees na medyo galante yung cups, pasta na maganda ang presentation, and fries na maganda ang itsura yet  typical lang ang lasa, she took pictures of them. It was okay at first, but then nung gusto ko na syang kausapin kase syempre na miss ko sya, she didn‚Äôt seem interested. Patuloy pa din sya sa pag pipic with so many angles. Lalayo sa table namin to get the whole view of our meal, and worse she told me to take a picture of her while holding her cup tapos dapat daw blurred ang background tapos clear lang yung cup. Very noticeable na yung mga kilos nya sa loob because wala namang nagpipic doon. Chill lang yung mga tao kase galing work. And nung kumakain na kame patuloy pa din sya, but this time video naman. She was recording herself while kinakain yung pasta.  Ayon, medyo na turn off ako sa kanya. I understand na medyo instagramable yung place but it was extreme for me. Sarap sana mag joke ng ‚Äúfirst time mo dito te‚Äù ganern.

Di masyado kame nakapag usap ng maayos. Na drain energy ko sakanya. After all those years na di kame nagkita, dapat excited kame to meet each other. Pinahirapan nya pa ako mag send ng mga pics and videos nya. Btw, the phone that she used was mine. Kase iphone daw. Haisst. Halos pareho kame ng sahod and both may responsibilities sa fam. Gusto ko lang tlga ng kasama, pero turns out mas okay na lang mag solo. ",2,1728111676.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

I'm currently affected  by (and under treatment for) depression and that could skew the symptoms.

I have very little space awareness and I ""dodge"" cabinets and wardrobes at the last second. I have done it constantly for all my life and only recently I've discovered, through a random YouTube short, that it could be related to ADHD.

I have moments in which I need to be over stimulated to function and moments in which I'm irritable and need to isolate myself from noise. This is disruptive enough that I cannot share my study room with other people, which has resulted to some attritions with my dad, who shares with me the working space.

Caffeine puts me to sleep. Sometimes I have a cup of coffee in the middle of the night to be able to get 8 hours of shut-eye. Very frequently I find myself going back to sleep in the morning after I drank my coffee. I only recently discovered that this could be related to ADHD.

I find myself scared of beginning anything. In particular, I'm 3 years behind schedule with university because I cannot bring myself to start my thesis. I get constant, crippling panic attacks every time the topic is brought up or I try to start studying or writing. This is not only confined to that: this keeps happening for me for any long-term project I embark into, and continues even if I force myself to keep the course. The panic attacks bring me physical pain and I have to take long pauses just to feel better.

* Using terrain Devtools to raise and then collapse terrain

* Blowing them up with grenades
* Dropping collapsed blocks into the holes (*Does not create rubble*)
* Using Dev Replace Wrench to try and set it all to air, or frames
* Utilizing Noclip to force blocks into place while clipped inside

senior year started off great as well, and we soon had our falling out. it was for a stupid reason: one that also was my fault for flaking on our plans to walk to a coffee place. i soon realized she was angry with me, and she sort of started ignoring me. i went through a lot of confusion and anxiety during the time she was ignoring me because i was not used to it, and so i began ignoring her back. once it was clear she wanted to ‚Äòbe close again‚Äô, i feel like i had already emotionally detached myself from our friendship and i kind of stopped wanting to be friends. we had a falling out, in which more people from our friend group voiced frustrations about mari and i realized that mari was treating them poorly. by the end of november, mari and i were officially no longer friends. 

fast forward to now: my friends started college, and they got to school with mari. i decided to message mari and simply say ‚Äògood luck with school and i hope you enjoy college üíú‚Äô to which she sent a screenshot from the unsent project website (you can send anonymous messages to people and i sent one under her name saying that i wish things hadn‚Äôt ended the way they did) and she asked me if i sent that. i accepted it, and told her i did and it was still true. she disliked my message and essentially didn‚Äôt respond back, to which i sent a final message saying that i hope she enjoys school and has a nice life. i sent that message with good intentions, but looking back now i feel i may have been too nice. 

i only told 3 people i messaged mari, and two of them told me i shouldn‚Äôt have, while one told me she understands why i did. i think i wanted closure, that even though we‚Äôre not friends we could at least put everything behind us once and for all. and i guess that wasn‚Äôt the case. idk, i feel like i was the ah for messaging her. pls give advice ?

Once she found out we decided to nickel and dime every expense and save up that amount for the time we'd be out of work. That worked perfectly since both of our leaves were unpaid. Now, once her leave was up she decided she didn't want to go back because we ""couldn't find a baby sitter"" despite there being a ton of daycares and even family willing to pitch in. Initially it worked out pretty good because she's a school teacher and it was maybe 2 weeks left in school so they basically just said don't worry about it. But they sent a letter of intent to come back to work which she ignored and when the problems began. 

  
The problem is that with us both contributing we do pretty good financially but with just me I'm drowning. Every single week I'm down to digging change out of my car just to get gas to get to and from work. I brought it up once and it started a huge argument so I've kept it to myself ever since and I do everything I can to not let her in on the fact that we're constantly broke and she has no idea. But it is absolutely taking its toll on me. I'm a Butcher so I'm not some Software Engineer mad that I can't always get the largest most expensive Starbucks coffee, I'm literally struggling to be able to get lunch at all. 

  
This way of living is new to me... I've never been spoiled or privledged but I've always been able to live ok within my means. And living like this now has completely sucked the joy out of fatherhood for me. Because to add to that then comes the feelings of inadequacy because is this sacrifice what being a father is, iwhat being a man is? Am I wrong for having these feelings? Am I just supposed to suffer in silence? Am I selfish for not wanting to do this long term? AITAH

* AAPL (Apple / US) up 70% 
* BROS (Dutch Brothers Coffee) down 23%. 

  
My question is, do I continue to hold these until AAL and BROS start hitting positives and then combine them into my VTI/VXUS/BND mixture, or do I just do it at a loss and go for it now? Any advice welcome. TIA. ",1,1728109072.0,Bogleheads,4,0.66,False

A little back story... Quite recently our daughter was diagnosed as Autistic, it was a really, really long journey to get there and we are now settling into our groove and understanding her with so much more clarity. It has not been easy, although it has come with the revelation that I am also Autistic myself, her dad is ADHD and possibly big bro too. The learning curve is steep!

One of our daughters struggles is communicating, particularly in high stress situations where she will be situationally mute. So In light of this we designed some self advocacy/ communication cards. We came up with these style cards after we had purchased several sets but our daughter refused to use them saying they were ‚Äòcringe‚Äô or ‚Äòtoo babyish‚Äô. We felt we needed to offer her something that did not infantalise her (even though she's only 9).¬†

So she has been heavily involved in the design process alongside myself and her dad, a graphic designer with a passion for communication.¬†

You can read all about that here [https://alwaysautistic.substack.com/p/find-your-voice](https://alwaysautistic.substack.com/p/find-your-voice)

These cards were initially a PDF print it out and make it yourself card set to put in your bag but quickly developed into being translated as an APP!¬† We have really seen how valuable these tools are to her and realised how useful they can be to other people struggling with communication.

For her they bridge the gap between knowing what she wants to say but not being able to express it in the moment using her voice¬† They are changing her daily life and stopping meltdowns in their tracks!

I am trying to get these out there in the wild so they can help as many people as possible, we have kept the price of both items super low so that they are attainable for everyone- 5 dollars being about the price of a coffee (where I live anyway).
