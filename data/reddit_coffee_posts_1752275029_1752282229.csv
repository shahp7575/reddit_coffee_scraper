I mean I like *Little City* and *Reprise* but our choices feel so limiting when you think options would be opening up more. Like, Bolt was serving single origin espresso and pour-overs years back, but has really dropped off IMO.

It’s just in such contrast to cities on the west coast I’ve visited. I like options!

I see a lot of talking about the benefit of quitting completely. 

I've tried several times but the thing I come back to is that it tastes so good.

I'm often NOT  going out with the purpose of getting drunk and not remembering anything thw next day.

I genuinely really like the taste. Similar to how I like coffee.

Well a long time back members were asked to participate in a rule update. Don't worry we got your feedback and, well, the teacher mods were being lazy again and did not update the rules. How do these teacher mods ever get anything done around here without me 💅???

Anytittyhoots here is the quick and dirty key update changes:

* Surveys will be allowed for institution based research on teachers and teachery related things like the non-existent burnout and how much coffee is too much coffee.
* edtech grifters people will sadly still be hated and reported on. They are also no longer allowed to use the loophole of requesting feature feedback.
* The entire rules are written in a more positive form to be easier to read.
* Mod Secretaries will be paid an additional stipend for posting announcements.

This is a long post and I’m hoping people can have fun with while throwing out some realistic ideas.  Discussing this project with an architect but we have absolutely zero vision for how this plays out.  I’ve seen a lot of great ideas her

First image is the house we want to move into.  62’ wide, 26.8’ deep on left, 33.4’ deep on right.  Around 1450 sqft. Sits on a 140’ wide x 190’ deep lot. Setback 65’ from street and 35’ from the left.  Built in 98 by a small builder.

Second & third pictures are our current home. We like our current home a lot but moving means 0.2 acres to 0.6 acres, better schools, closer to friends, and we can buy the house outright and finance the renovations or vice versa.

**Complications include…**

* Roughly 40% smaller and no storage (adding detached garage/barn can cover storage).  We have a 4 year old and a 2 year old.  The basement in our current home is their escape when they’re sick and tired of being upstairs.
* Block foundation and slab floor but brick fascia all the way around.  Coming from 80% vinyl siding.
* Water and sewer - No water or sewer right of the kitchen table or left of the bathrooms. It’s all kinda centralized down the middle of the house and enters at the front middle of the house.  Main shut off is in the laundry/utility closet
* No pantry
* Trusses run front to back and 95% certain the center wall is load bearing.  Only 8’ ceilings.
* House cannot extend beyond the garage towards the street

**Desires**

* More like our current home if not more than our current home
* 4 bed (or 3 bed and a den/office) - add a master suite including walk in closet from bedroom. Master bath with his and her sinks, medium to large walk in shower (minimal glass). No tub.
* 2.5 bath with half bath closer to entertaining/living space
* Add / split off a foyer / mudroom / drop zone accessible to garage and front door
* Laundry / pantry / utility room combination or separate spaces. Counter space inside for random appliances like air fryer blender coffee etc.  Currently washer/dryer is always too noisy in kitchen and living room space
* Kitchen update. More counter space. Island. Eat in capable of sitting 6 regularly, 8 on occasion. No formal dining space.
* More open concept.
* More natural light flowing front to back. Sun rises in the front sets in the back which leads too…
* 14-16ft deep covered patio across back of the house
* Flex room like our basement for kids toys, home gym, media center
* Detached garage/barn 30x40 or something. Not really sure on size here. Will contain a golf simulator at some point (basic, nothing wild), capable of storing 2 cars but really only one and yard tools, kids toys.  Bathroom and hangout space but can’t be livable
* 3, 4, 5 years down the road, in ground pool - not sold on this yet but kids would love it and all our friends have kids the same age.  Brings people to us.  Ideally want to plan for it and if it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen but would be a sweet setup to have house, pool, and detached building designed to all flow together",1,1752281835.0,floorplan,0,1.0,False
1lxnj5w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lxnj5w,"Room for rent in sunny, light-filled apartment w porch and backyard - $1600 PLG 8/1","Must be ok with cats! 2 cats are in the space. Won't be able to accept other pets.

ABOUT THE ROOM:

The rental breakdown is $1600 for the big bedroom. Utilities are $150 or so per person absolute max, in the most expensive months (central a/c and central heat so peak winter/peak summer). A deposit of $1600 and the first month's rent are required upon move-in.

The bedroom is spacious with two floor-to-ceiling closets, two windows, and lots of floor space. It comes unfurnished.

The bedroom is the size of the two other rooms combined. It's absolutely massive.

ABOUT THE BACKYARD:

We have a big, fenced-in, private backyard. I'm planning to do some vegetable beds and would love if another gardener moved into the space who would enjoy adding to the beautifying of the backyard! (bonus not a requirement ;))

We have a back patio that's wonderful in the mornings and the evenings to watch the sunset and sunrise, listen to the birds chirp. Stairs lead down to the fenced-in backyard. We have a swing for lounging, some string lights on the fence, and a projector that I've liked to set up in the summer for movie nights projected on a sheet on the fence back there. There's a grill (that I've never used tbh!) and everything is fully closed in from the outside world. It's not possible to enter the backyard except through a tenant door. Our neighbors to the right and the left have a fenced in backyard of their own next to ours. Our patio is connected to our neighbor's patio. They're great neighbors.

ABOUT THE AREA:

We have a coffee shop directly across the street, a Wholesome Gourmet Market for snacks and other items just 200 feet from our doorstep, a laundromat, a grocery store, and a local hardware store, all within a block. Good food delivery. We're right by the 2/5 and an easy walk to the Q, B, and Prospect Park.

ABOUT ME:

I am a 30-something LGBTQ+ woman, a graphic designer who works at a garden during the day, and am a student at a design school.

When I'm home, I'm often doing homework, freelance graphic design work, or chilling out watching a movie or TV show (Taskmaster is my current comfort watch).

I'm sociable, tidy, and a people-person, but I know when to keep to myself. I leave the apartment for all of my socializing, but I enjoy having guests and people in the house.

I've lived in BK for a little over 5 years.

OTHER ROOMMATE:

Audio engineer who works varying hours at a recording studio. She's in her 20s and has 2 cats.

RENTAL REQUIREMENTS:

The first month's rent is $1600, a deposit of $1600, and a 12-month lease. Guarantors are welcome.

We have a big, fenced-in, private backyard. I'm planning to do some vegetable beds and would love if another gardener moved into the space who would enjoy adding to the beautifying of the backyard! (bonus not a requirement ;))

We have a back patio that's wonderful in the mornings and the evenings to watch the sunset and sunrise, listen to the birds chirp. Stairs lead down to the fenced-in backyard. We have a swing for lounging, some string lights on the fence, and a projector that I've liked to set up in the summer for movie nights projected on a sheet on the fence back there. There's a grill (that I've never used tbh!) and everything is fully closed in from the outside world. It's not possible to enter the backyard except through a tenant door. Our neighbors to the right and the left have a fenced in backyard of their own next to ours. Our patio is connected to our neighbor's patio. They're great neighbors.

ABOUT THE AREA:

We have a coffee shop directly across the street, a Wholesome Gourmet Market for snacks and other items just 200 feet from our doorstep, a laundromat, a grocery store, and a local hardware store, all within a block. Good food delivery. We're right by the 2/5 and an easy walk to the Q, B, and Prospect Park.

ABOUT ME:

I am a 30-something LGBTQ+ woman, a graphic designer who works at a garden during the day, and am a student at a design school.

When I'm home, I'm often doing homework, freelance graphic design work, or chilling out watching a movie or TV show (Taskmaster is my current comfort watch).

I'm sociable, tidy, and a people-person, but I know when to keep to myself. I leave the apartment for all of my socializing, but I enjoy having guests and people in the house.

I've lived in BK for a little over 5 years.

OTHER ROOMMATE:

Audio engineer who works varying hours at a recording studio. She's in her 20s and has 2 cats.

RENTAL REQUIREMENTS:

The first month's rent is $1600, a deposit of $1600, and a 12-month lease. Guarantors are welcome.

1lxnfxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1lxnfxn/apparently_having_reddit_and_twitter_open_means_i/,Apparently having Reddit and Twitter open means I watch porn now,"I’ve noticed a bizarre social phenomenon lately, and it’s honestly too consistent to ignore. Every so often, someone asks to borrow my phone, maybe they need to use the hotspot, look something up, or their own device mysteriously died at 3%. I have no problem sharing. But something very specific always happens when they glance at my screen and see Reddit or Twitter open in the background.

Immediately, there’s this pause, a shift in expression, like they’ve just discovered a hidden folder titled “Private (Do Not Click).” Sometimes it’s a smirk. Sometimes it’s a raised eyebrow followed by something like, “Damn, you really just keep Reddit and Twitter open like that?” One guy even hit me with a casual, “You’re brave,” as if I’d just passed him a phone full of unspeakable sins and anime thighs.

Let me be clear: I use these platforms the same way most people use coffee. To function. Reddit is where I browse productivity threads, troubleshoot weird tech issues, and read 600-comment debates on whether standing desks are a scam. Twitter is where I follow industry news, design threads, and people arguing about app logos like their lives depend on it. That’s it. Nothing scandalous. Just a normal amount of digital suffering.

But no… Apparently , just having these two apps open is enough to trigger a full character assessment. Suddenly I’m being judged like I handed them my browser history printed out and laminated. Once, after a guy made one of those “oh-ho-ho what do you do with Reddit?” comments, his own phone lit up on the table with a very visible Grindr notification. I didn’t say anything at first, but the timing was just too good to let slide. I looked up and said, “Wow. Nice notification.” The silence that followed could’ve powered a small village.

The thing is, you can’t win. Try to explain yourself, and you sound defensive. Stay quiet, and it confirms whatever wild fantasy they’ve already constructed in their heads. So I’ve stopped bothering. Let them assume. If thinking I’m five swipes away from a scandal helps them sleep better, be my guest. I’ll be over here reading a thread about monitor arms while being mentally convicted for crimes I didn’t commit.

Next time someone asks to borrow my phone, I’m tempted to leave something even more confusing open like an empty Notes file titled “Plan C: If Plan B Fails” or a spreadsheet that just says “Debt.” Maybe even a Bible app for balance. If nothing else, it’ll at least add to the mystery.

So yes, I use Reddit. And Twitter. No, it’s not what you think. And if it is, well, I hope the plot twist keeps your day interesting",3,1752281551.0,malaysia,5,0.8,False

But anyway this time it was totally valid freaking out about orientation, but was it necessary to mention the coffee date? Like oh, that'll be great, but everyone knows I'm so oversensitive and JEALOUS. 

lmaoooooooo my better judgment is telling me not to post this because it's stupid of me. To push people away and then get all boo hoo when they leave. Not that you did that or anything. But my stubborn and awkward self doesn't know how to make myself not sad.

I would love to hear your thoughts and opinions on the situation I am currently in. Some advice would be appreciated as well. Thanks.

**About us:**

I'm in my mid 40s, she's in her late 30s. We've been married for 16 years. We have a 5 year-old daughter.

**Our living arrangements:**

I work on my business and provide everything for the family. We're not rich, but we live in a really nice house, drive a nice car, and all the bills are taken care of. I work from home, so I'm always available if anything is needed.

My wife does not work. She has worked in the past but hasn't worked since covid (2019). Her mother lives with us and does all the housework like cleaning, cooking, laundry, etc. She's been living with us for 4-5 years now (it was my wife's dream for her mother to live with us). My wife takes care of our daughter (classes, playgrounds, playdates, etc). She's a good mother.

My wife has everything she's dreamed of:  a family,  a house, living in a beautiful place. not having to work, her mother living with us, but somehow it's never enough.

**The problem:**

My wife would have these random psychotic episodes where she would attack me and blame me for not loving her enough, not doing enough for her, not being the same loving person I ""used to be"". During fights, she tells me she does not respect me, she does not love me, talking about divorce. She deliberately says things that would hurt even if those things are not true, like calling me a bad father and that she wishes our daughter never marries someone like me (I'm always there for my daughter and spend time with her whenever I am not busy with work. I work from home so I'm always around her. I know I'm a good father.). I used to get upset and hurt over these attacks but over the years I've learned that this psychotic state she's in is only temporary. Sure enough, some time would pass and she would be all loving and caring again. Life would go on.  
Over the years her attacks would increase in intensity. It got so bad I would actually question her sanity. A couple of years ago during another episode she broke my finger in a psychotic rage (I never hit her in my life). I really thought about leaving after that and told her about it. She kinda cleaned up her act after that for a little bit. She promised she would never hit me, she would be the best wife ever, that she was wrong, I was the best husband she could wish for. Unfortunately, it did not last long. She would go from loving, caring wife to a demon with a flip of a switch. It happens in waves from super happy to mad, aggressive, upset. I started to think she was bipolar or something but was never sure.  
We don't do much together like couples. We don't really have dates or anything like that. She says she wants to but to be honest I don't feel like it. I don't know if it would help.

**Crisis:**  
We're in another crisis now. This time she crossed the line and disrespected me like never before. Here's what happened:  
She asked me to go to the beach with her, our daughter, and a bunch of people from my daughter's dance class and their kids. There must have been 30 adults and 20+ kids (I don't know most of those people). She wanted to take a couple of bottles of wine to the beach. I said I don't feel comfortable opening bottles right there on the beach with a bunch of kids running around. I can pour the wine in some container instead. She ignored what I said and took the bottles (she was packing, I had no idea). We're at the beach, she says she wants some wine and have a good time, asked me to open a bottle. I look inside the bag, there's wine bottles. I said ""Listen, I told you. I don't feel comfortable sitting here with a corkscrew opening wine with all the kids around"". And she shouts at me ""You old paranoid moron. Go fuck yourself!"" and storms away. Right there, in front of everybody. I don't think I ever felt this ashamed and belittled in my life. A public humiliation for not wanting to have alcohol around kids. I was stunned and confused.

Later, I walked up to her and explained AGAIN why I didn't want to open a bottle and that I've told her at home earlier. She played it off like ""Oh, if you would have told me I would not have ask you"". She pretended to be stupid and that she didn't know even though her own mother confirmed that I said it at home and she agrees with me.

Anyways, I got dunked on, disrespected, humiliated, for no apparent (to me) reason.

A few days later she spoke to me and said she feels so bad for us both that we are so unhappy together, that I never do things for her like I used to do. And that my moral integrity never stopped me from doing things for her before(whatever that means). More of the same. She never apologized.

So, I've been ignoring her for the past month or so. I try to keep our contact and interaction to a minimum because I don't feel like talking to her after what she did. I feel numbness towards her. She still asks me to make her coffee or whatever, but I politely decline.

She looks upset, sometimes mad, and kinda on the edge. She lashes out at her mother for no reason, but she does that often. Today, she texted me saying ""You can find another woman. I don't mind. bla bla bla"".

I've been experiencing this amazing love and then hurtful disrespect for a long time, and over the years the tone shifts primarily to disrespect.

I've just recently learned what a narcissist is and I think she checks most of the boxes. She always says that she's a  perfect wife, a perfect mother, and a perfect housewife. She fishes for compliments all the time.  
I think I figured it out.

1lxnc0f,https://i.redd.it/x3vz5zfqbccf1.jpeg,Starbucks D15 is not a traveler’s recommended destination.,"Today, I had a flight from IAD to BNA on United. I am going to start by saying the flight itself was great. The crew rocked. 

The service at the Starbucks at the D15 gate has left a horrible taste in my mouth. 

Upon approach to the Starbucks, I saw the line was bad, so I placed a mobile order.  I broke the norm and did not order my black cold brew, basic b**** order. It was Friday, so throwing caution to the wind, I ordered one of the new Strato Frappucinos. $7.72 later, I proceeded to the mobile order counter. 

3-6 minutes the app said. After 10 minutes, I looked at what appeared to be an iced coffee with too much cream that has my name on it. Since it looked nothing like a Frappuccino, I never thought it could be my order. It had been sitting there for a few extra minutes at this point. 

I said to the barista, this is not a Frappuccino. Please note, I had smiled at her a few times while waiting. I was met with, first, hello works better. I said ok, hello, this is not a Frappuccino. She insisted it was. Sorry lady, pouring shots of espresso in a cup with Frappuccino mix over ice and then pouring straight cream on top is not a Frappuccino. I asked for it to be remade. 

Barista turned down right nasty. Another employee, in a black apron (not sure that makes a difference from the standard green apron), said she would remake it. She did and it was exactly as expected. 

Regardless of the mood of the employee, Starbucks guarantees any beverage not made to your liking will be remade at no charge. Since I generally drink black cold brew, I have never exercised this option. This should not have been an issue or an inconvenience. 

The original barista got snippy with me when I thanked the second employee for making the drink correctly. That’s when my cooler head failed to prevail. I asked for a manager and the problem barista told me to leave or she would call the police. 

At this point, I began recording her and asked her to please call the police. She pretended to call the police as they never showed up. 

I am a Starbucks everyday gal (don’t judge) and do not think I have ever experienced an attitude quite like what I received from the disgruntled employee. 

Maybe she can become famous, because my really bad week was capped off with her drama and a threat to call the police because I asked to talk to her manager after requesting my drink be remade. ",1,1752281226.0,IAD,0,1.0,False

1lxnadk,https://i.redd.it/77nx4ffbbccf1.jpeg,Fleas.,"My little boy ended up with fleas. I had him on a flea treatment that was shit obviously because it didn’t protect him. I’m pretty sure he got them from being at my parents house last weekend, there’s a bunch of feral cats that live on the side of our house. We’ve been working with the feral cat community to come scoop them up and hopefully adopt them out/rehome them. They’ve been reproducing on my parents property for the last few years and I feel terrible watching them just linger in the heat, reproducing and struggling with no end in sight. I’m hoping we get some relief to the poor babies. Back to my flea issue, the crappy FrontLine I got for him didn’t do him any good, don’t ask me why I picked Frontline, I probably picked it because the price was right and I just needed to pick something, but I started doing research the last few months and I’ve been reading up a lot about the oral treatments they have available. Well, now that my boy ended up with a flea infestation I reached out to his vet and she prescribed him Bravecto? He just got out of the groomer where he got a medicated flea bath, and the groomer is pretty confident she got all the fleas off of him. She said he was covered in flea poop, which I knew because I was horrified when I woke up this morning and saw his face smh he was peppered with it. It looked like he got into coffee grounds, especially between his brows (My cat is completely unaffected. She hasn’t had one flea on her). I have also been using the Wondercide spray this whole week while I was waiting to get him into his grooming appointment today and the Wondercide works miracles, I will say, and my place smells wonderful lol but I had to constantly apply it to him so it’s not something that was gonna beat this infestation and I don’t think it’ll keep him from getting them again when he goes to my parents house, not without me having to douse him constantly, anyway. So I’ve picked him up from his groomer and he, our cat, and I are staying at a hotel for the night while I’m setting off foggers in my place. Anyone within an experience with Bravecto? Have you had good results? Any intense side effects? I’m just worried about giving him anything orally. I don’t want it to have ridiculous side affects on him. He’s so tiny. Any insight is appreciated! ",4,1752281091.0,Yorkies,0,1.0,False

In Memorium

Lately one of my favorite pastimes, albeit slightly morbid, has become browsing obituaries while I'm having my morning coffee.  Something about reading articles concerning those who have passed on... it just stirs up my conscience way more than I have to stir in the creamer to my Breakfast Blend.  Maybe part of that stems from perhaps the curiosity of seeing someone I knew and thinking ""Well, that's unfortunate."" Questions I pose in my mind such as ""I wonder what it was did them in?"" Or, ""If they could go so young, perhaps I'm not so far away from leaving this place either."" 

Another part of it I think makes me reflect on my own mortality and how my loved ones may, or may not, celebrate my own life. And that really tickles the part of my mind that wonders, from time to time, if I ever made a truly positive difference in anyone's life.

What will be my legacy?

I suppose my wishes would probably consist of, first and foremost, for the service to not make mention of religion at all.  As to say, dont worry, people who loved me, about what happens to me next. Instead I think I would have everyone remember a time that I made them smile or laugh or touched their soul in some way. It is my belief that when people die, they simply cease to exist. Perhaps we return to the state of nothingness that we existed as before we were born onto this crazy blue marble we call home. But, in my opinion, as long as at least one person remembers you for something, at least a small part of you remains to be living.  It reminds me of a quote I heard somewhere once...

""He's not truly dead, as long as we remember him.""

Tech? Other?","I'm 37, and I've worked in my current industry (coffee roasting aka food manufacturing) for over a decade. I've worked mostly for small businesses and one medium business (still small according to the federal government, but medium in industry terms). I'm at the point where I could likely get a job at any company that roasts coffee. I lead a coffee roasting facility with a small team (5 or fewer). At each roasting facility I've worked at, I have overseen or been the SME for all of the roasting operations including packaging, fulfillment, and retail and wholesale customer correspondence.

I have lead projects involving equipment procurement and training, workflow management (think 5S, Kaizen, Lean), managed inventories and raw product procurement and contracts totaling over $2mn a year, have had direct conversations with vendors and coffee farmers, etc.

All that said, I still make less than the median income in my HCOL area. For being an expert in my field, you'd think that would mean a higher salary. However, positions in this industry are \*rarely\* open, so it's really an employer's market, and always will be especially as things become more and more automated. That, coupled with these companies operating on such slim margins, that literally isn't room to make much more.

I have next to nothing saved for retirement. I need to make more money. I've tried consulting and I've tried starting my own business. I've learned a couple of things about myself over the years: a) I do not enjoy leading people (it just doesn't come naturally; I could probably get better at it, but I've never had a mentor), and b) I don't enjoy trying to sell anything to people.

TLDR: I don't make enough, and there's very limited room for growth.

# What I've Considered:

**Electrician**

I've looked into getting into electrical work. I've done low voltage work before, and Electricians seem to make good money. I spoke with the local unions, and the backlog of people waiting to be given a job is hundreds of people long, and has been for two or more years.

**Web Development**

I actually went through a coding bootcamp and did pretty well with it. Unfortunately, when it came time for my final project I hit a stumbling block. My mentor (you were to meet with a mentor twice a week) went on vacation for 3 weeks during my final project that was supposed to take 2 weeks. Mentor got back, told me to do this one thing, which we just couldn't get to work. Long story short, two months later they finally gave me a new mentor after multiple requests. That mentor helped me solve the issue within one meeting (there was a pre-built tool to do the thing I was trying to implement). Unfortunately, by then, I had forgotten a lot of what I had learned, I was exhausted, I was battling some Repetitive Stress Injury and thus was unable to continue on to the final test and career coaching portions. Despite all my troubles, the school didn't honor their guarantee, and I was out a lot of money and 8 months of my time.

I \*do\* think I could do well in tech, but all the layoffs recently has me very worried. And, let's face it, I'm pretty old for a career change into tech.

# What I'm Looking For

To sum up, I think what I need is the following:

\- Ability to not take my work home with me.

\- No leadership role.

\- Ability to make $100,000+ in a HCOL metropolitan area (this is true for both of the career paths I mentioned before) so that I can start saving for retirement.",1,1752280713.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

It’s for anyone who’s ever thought, “Man, that drive was something.” Post the tiny, unscripted moments: “Sat in traffic behind a van covered in bumper stickers. One said ‘My dog is cooler than your kid.’ Laughed so hard, the guy in front rolled down his window to ask what’s up. Ended up chatting about our pets for 10 minutes. Gridlock turned into a good day.” Share the “wait, did that really happen?” gems: “Drove through a small town at sunset. A group of kids were chasing fireflies in a field. Hit play on my old country playlist, and for a second, everything felt like a movie. Forgot I was even heading home.”Here, we cheer for the “no way!” twists and nod along to the “been there” vibes. “Took a wrong turn on the way to a friend’s. Ended up on a backroad with a view of the lake. Pulled over, ate my fast food, and watched the stars. Best detour ever.” Swap the little things that make driving feel less like a chore: “Pro move: Keep a notebook in the glove box. Jotted down a story idea while waiting for my coffee order. Turned into a fun little tale about a trucker and a lost puppy.”You don’t need a fancy car or a cross-country trip—just a willingness to notice. Post the “I can’t believe I remembered that” moments: “Passed the house I grew up in on my commute. Suddenly, I was 16 again, begging my dad to let me drive his truck. He said ‘Only if you promise not to hit the mailbox.’ Spoiler: I hit the mailbox. We laughed about it for years.” Admit the messy, real stuff: “Cried during a drive last week. Just… life got heavy. Turned up a sad song and let it out. Felt better. Sometimes, the car’s the best therapist.”Drive time stories aren’t about being perfect—they’re about being human. It’s the way a song can transport you, the way a stranger’s smile at a stoplight can lift your mood, the way the open road makes you feel like anything’s possible. So grab that story you’ve been chuckling about, that moment you haven’t told anyone, and hit “post.” The next tale you share might be the one that makes someone else smile through their own commute.",1,1752280444.0,DriveTimeStoriesF,0,1.0,False

Hi, I’m currently in emergency housing at a hotel after leaving a domestic violence situation. I don’t have a kitchen, just a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. I’ve run out of food. I used a comb to eat my last can of soup I heated up in a paper hotel cup.
There are no food banks open until at least Tuesday, I've left messages for charities but not in time to get s response and it's the weekend now and I'm starving. Safe but starving. I plan on stretching the $40 for a whole week until I get some assistance.

If anyone is able to help with $40, or any amount,  it would make a huge difference to be able to get some basic foods that are hotel friendly and some dollar store cutlery, to be able to eat.

(I'm not allowed in the main part of the hotel as a long term guest so I can't go ask for cutlery, plates etc.)

So my blue Vertuo Pop + over the last 2 days started shortening 7.7oz pods down to espresso size, so I decided to descale. Connected the machine to the app started the process and the descale process kept stopping every 10 seconds or so, but not like normal. It would completely stop and kick me back to the previous step (press the button to start descale process) so I kept following the directions, took about 25 min to finish the whole tank of water and descale mix. So I empty the container, fill the water tank back up with water to start rinse and the thing goes completely dead. This is my second device is 3 years. So I call and finally get tech support. After an hour and 15 minutes of video chat so he can see the device and going through prompts - hold button and unplug, plug it back it. Press the button 5 times, now 3 times. Okay now open it and close it, remove and empty the tank then refill it. Over and over and over again - So I start to be like okay this isn’t working so what are we going to do here and he starts to tell me I need more patience and he has an ocean of information on these things and we will figure it out. Finally he’s like okay let me go speak to my supervisor. He comes back and says, the device is out of waranty so only option is to send it for repair for a $65 dollar fee. I laugh and say no I’m not doing that, I’ll just go back to drip coffee. He asks for 2 more min to go back to supervisor, comes back and says okay our other option is we can give you 35% off a new device.

Yes, my wallet cried.

But nothing reveals the truth like a week of blackouts. Surprise storms. 

Trying to keep your fridge from becoming a science experiment.

# The moment I realized only one would survive my storm test

The first time the power snapped off during dinner.

I grabbed both stations.

Delta 2 is lighter.

Way easier to haul.

But halfway through cooking, the watt meter started dipping.

Six hours later, only the max was left standing.

My router. Fridge. Two lamps still running.

We even finished Netflix while my neighbors lost wifi.

My partner said it was the smartest thing I bought all year.

But my back was ready to quit by hour four.

# Why I almost gave up lugging the max upstairs

Here’s the deal.

Delta 2 max is a beast. Nearly 50 pounds.

No wheels.

And after a heavy leg day, carrying that up two flights feels like punishment.

But the quiet? Legit impressive.

Even when it pushed a portable AC, it stayed under 60 decibels.

I expected a leaf blower. Got a white noise machine instead.

# The feature that made delta 2 feel smarter for small jobs

For quick setups; overnight CPAP. TV. Router, the regular delta 2 shines.

* Weighs under 30 pounds
* Charges to 80 percent in about 50 minutes
* 1024 Wh capacity is solid for small needs

I ran a 55 inch TV. Wifi. Backlights for 5 hours while baking cookies. No issues.

# The moment delta 2 max flexed on the competition

Here’s where wattage really mattered.

Tried to run a 5000 BTU AC.

Delta 2 couldn’t even start it.

Max ran it for nearly four hours.

Same with a table saw and miter saw combo.

Max handled both. Delta 2 tripped instantly.

That’s when I realized. Bigger isn’t just about more battery.

It’s about running stuff the smaller one can’t even start.

# What nobody warned me about the port layouts

Delta 2 max gives you 15 ports.

But they’re everywhere. Back. Sides. Front.

It’s a scavenger hunt every time.

Delta 2 has fewer ports, but all on the front.

Easier when it’s sitting on the floor.

# Three unexpected things I learned after a month of testing

1. The weight difference is real. Max is almost double. Not fun for stairs.
2. Max supports up to 6 kWh extra batteries. Regular delta 2 doesn’t.
3. Max is a lot quieter than other 2 kWh units I’ve owned. Didn’t expect that.

# My family’s verdict after two storm seasons

I let my partner and parents try both units for a weekend.

* Both preferred the regular delta 2 for moving around the house
* Everyone agreed the max was king for keeping the fridge and wifi on overnight
* Nobody wanted to be the one carrying it up the stairs

My dad said, “It’s the only thing standing between us and spoiled groceries.”

# The price reality check most people skip

Delta 2 usually sells for around $450 to $700.

Delta 2 max is about $1,600 if you catch it on sale.

That’s a big leap.

But if you want to expand later (add more battery, solar integration)? Only the max does it.

💡 Pro tip: If you ever want to future proof your setup, the max is the only one that supports extra batteries up to 6 kWh.

# Week by week: how I actually used both

Week 1. Storm hits. Power out. Both units tested side by side. 

Max lasts hours longer. Runs more stuff. Never overheats.

Week 2. Weekend camping. Delta 2 is easy to pack. 

Keeps fan, lights, and phone charged all night.

Week 3. Tried both on power tools. Max is the only one that can handle high watt jobs.

Week 4. Backup for CPAP. Both fine. Delta 2 is lighter and easier to move.

By week 5, I stopped using the delta 2 for anything but quick power outs.

# The real lesson nobody tells you after weeks with both

If you only need to keep a couple devices running for a few hours, delta 2 is all you need.

But for anything serious, freezer, power tools, long blackouts, you want the max.

It’s not about watt hours.

It’s about what you’ll actually plug in when it matters.

# Before and after: life with and without a backup station

Before backup:

* Candlelight dinners (not romantic)
* Food waste every time the power went out
* Stress about medical gear running out

After both deltas:

* Hot meals even during storms
* Netflix while neigbors panic
* Never once lost a fridge full of food

# The one thing I’d change if I could

I wish the max had wheels.

Dragging 50 pounds through the dark is a nightmare.

But would I buy it again?

Absolutely.

Because if you’re going to spend, you want to buy once and not worry.

# Which one should you buy?

Get delta 2 if:

* You want something portable and affordable
* You only need to power a couple things
* You hate heavy lifting

Get delta 2 max if:

* You need real backup for big appliances or tools
* You want solar and extra battery options
* You never want to worry about running out

🧨 Quick comparison:

|Feature|delta 2|delta 2 max|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Capacity|1024 Wh|2048 wh|
|Output|1800w|2400w|
|Weight|27 lbs|50lbs|
|Max expandability|none|up to 6 kWh|
|Price|$450 to $700|$1.6k|

1lxmwdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1lxmwdr/odd_questions/,Odd questions,"This is my second time writing this, bear with me. 

My cat, D (2M), has become unusually aggressive with my husbands cat, P (12F). We have done reintroduction, play time, feeding together, bought new litter boxes, new toys, new cat trees, literally EVERYTHING the vet has told us, or Reddit. His unrelenting aggression towards P has not died down, if anything, it has only gotten worse. 

A couple weeks ago, D and P had gotten into it, which they only do when my husband isn’t home, and when I’m not looking. D managed to knock out one of P’s teeth, and we’ve tried to keep the separate since. Until the other day, when I had him out and about while doing chores. I heard a commotion from the dinning room, and when I had turned the corner, P had chased D underneath our recliner. I had immediately grabbed P and firmly told her “No.” P started licking around her mouth and acting like she was in pain. That’s when I found ANOTHER one of her canines sitting on the tile floor. I picked it up, placed it somewhere safe and went absolutely ape shit. For context, no, I never once actually harmed any of the cats, but the living room was destroyed by the time I got a hold of D to put him in the spare bathroom. The recliner was flipped, the coffee table was pushed to the other side of the room, chairs from the dinning table were strung across the room. 

Since that day, D has been away from P at all times. At night, we switch between putting P in the office and D in the spare bathroom. D will pull up the carpet, that’s why he’s in the bathroom. They also switch between who’s allowed to roam the house during the day. Every hour or two, D is let out and P will be put in either the bedroom or office. This is so he doesn’t start to feel isolated. 

This has caused a rift between me and my husband. There is NOTHING more we can do unless we put him on medication or something. Mind you, they’re both fixed. We have begun talking of rehoming D, but hopefully not having to put him in a shelter. I’m genuinely not sure what to do anymore. I want to find a way to make him stop but everything we do seems to make him more aggressive towards P. 

I have a friend moving into our place in a couple of weeks, and was wondering if there was a possibility having someone new here could curb his aggression. I know it’s an extremely long shot, and probably unlikely. But I’ve read that sometimes new people in a home can change the way a cat behaves. 

Literally any advice is worth my time now. I don’t know what to do. I love my kitty, but he’s now a danger to my husbands’ cat. Is there any shot of having someone new here working this way? I’m already mentally prepared to rehome him, I suppose this is my last ditch effort to possibly keep him. ",1,1752279930.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False

If your idea of “guy talk” goes beyond fantasy football and into “How do we grow?” territory, pull up a chair—R/ForwardMaleThinkersA is your new corner of the internet.This isn’t a “bro zone” or a self-help seminar. It’s a spot where guys swap real talk about the stuff that matters. Post that “lightbulb moment” from your morning commute: “Realized I’ve been avoiding tough conversations at home because I hate conflict. Turns out, ‘I’m fine’ isn’t fixing anything. Small step: Said ‘I’m actually stressed’ tonight. Wife hugged me. Who knew?” Share the messy middle of growth: “Tried to be more present with the kids. Put down my phone… then spent 10 minutes panicking about work emails. Progress, not perfection, right?”Here, we laugh at the “I messed up” moments and cheer the “I tried” ones. “Told my buddy he was being a jerk. Thought he’d ghost me. Instead, he said ‘Thanks for calling me out.’ Friendship leveled up.” Swap hacks for adulting like a human, not a robot: “Pro move: Write down one thing you’re proud of each night. On bad days, it’s ‘Got out of bed.’ On good days, it’s ‘Nailed that presentation.’ Either way, you’re keeping score of *you*.”You don’t need a PhD or a fancy title—just a willingness to say, “I want to do better.” Post the wins that feel small but matter: “Stopped interrupting people. Turns out, listening makes you way more interesting.” Admit the stumbles: “Tried to be more patient with my dad. Snapped at him over something stupid. Apologized. He said ‘I’m proud of you for trying.’”Forward thinking isn’t about having all the answers—it’s about asking better questions. It’s looking in the mirror and thinking, “I can be kinder, sharper, more intentional,” then putting in the work. It’s walking through life knowing you’re not just coasting—you’re evolving. So grab your story (the messy, unpolished one), your willingness to learn, and join the crew.

1lxmvgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1lxmvgd/todays_step_1_experience/,Today's Step 1 Experience,"**Just finished Step 1 today, and I wanted to get this out while everything’s still fresh. Overall, it was a rollercoaster — a mix of stuff I felt solid on, some tricky curveballs, and a few sections where I genuinely had no clue how things went. If I fail, it's due to running out of time in the first 3 blocks.**

*Extra: if you are overlooking anything about pregnancy, you're cooked (at least you were if you had my form). Felt Like 20% of the Exam was either someone trying to get pregnant, already pregnant, or* who *just gave birth.*

**The Struggle Was Real (Early On):**

* I was **running out of time in the first few 3 blocks**, which may have been anxiety… but honestly, I was spending too much time on questions I should've flagged and skipped (rookie mistake).
* Be sure you can read vignettes and make a diagnosis fast without overlooking game changing details.
* If I could go back, I’d trust my gut more and **not waste time confirming answers**. The passages often include overwhelming info, but that doesn’t mean you need to go on a scavenger hunt for every clue. Once you've figured it out, answer the question. But you have to know your stuff to do this confidently and consistently. I was just worried I missed something and wanted to make sure every sign/symptom lined up with what I thought.
* On the other hand, **Almost every added detail in the vignette lets you rule out one of the answer choices**. So just be thorough

**What Surprised Me Most:**

* **Male & Female Repro heavy.** Or maybe that's just one of my weak sections so I noticed it more.
* **Biochem was minimal.** Maybe 5–10 questions total. Honestly wish I had spent less time grinding it. But I did answer them all in 30 seconds
* **(Sketchy) Pharm and Micro:** Know it *cold.* Don’t rely on vague associations. It's 50/50—they might test a random, low-yield detail from a high-yield organism. Sure it's a high yield drug/bug, but the question they ask or the detail they include in the vignette for you might be overlooked. **Every single sign and symptom is crucial...that's how you narrow down the answer choices.**
* **Lab values were everywhere.** Like, 30% of the test. You *have* to be able to quickly interpret lab panels. Every 3-5 questions had a laundry list of labs. Either learn what's normal or practice finding them asap in the toolbar.
* **Demographics = clutch as always.** Narrowed down many questions just based on age/sex/race.
* Very **many “most common cause” or “risk factor”** type questions. Do Mehlman and Divine Intervention Pod ep. 37 and 97.
* **Plenty of buzzwords**: Idk what people have been talking about, I felt like I saw a buzzword every 10 questions which is enough to still drill them
* **Extras:**
* **Very similar to Free 120.** A lot of long vignettes and patient chart-style questions. They look scary, but they usually repeat info or give unnecessary fluff. Obviously same concepts as the NBMEs but you will obviously not get the same question, the answer choices will often be more convoluted, and they will test something a little less high yield than what you're hoping for.
* My approach: **Read the last line of the vignette first on those patient note Qs with lab values**, then go back and hunt for what they're asking. Unless it doesn't intimidate you, then you can honestly just go through like a regular paragraph vignette, it's the same word count, just scarier looking.
* **PLEASE GET USED TO MATCHING TYPICAL ANSWER CHOICES WITH ALTERNATE LANGUAGE.** I swear I lost a lot of time just figuring out what the answer choices were even saying. Make sure you can not only make the diagnosis or know the bug/drug mechanism, but know what it means because the answer choice will turn your simple answer into something convoluted sounding but it's just describing what you should already know. It's not recall, you have to know this stuff at its most fundamental level
* **You won’t know what is experimental, but you'll know what's not lmao.** I *pray* they front-loaded mine, because the first few blocks were rough and I spiraled a bit. Blocks 6 & 7 were shockingly easy—I *know* I passed those two, even if I failed the test itself 😂

**Final 1-2 Weeks Are CRUCIAL:**  
I can’t stress this enough: **your last 1–2 weeks can make or break you if you've only been focusing on weaknesses and not reviewing some of the OG HY material**. I probably got **10–20 questions right just off stuff I reviewed in the final 72 hours**.

If you’re cramming:

* **Pathoma 1–3**
* **Mehlman docs** (especially ethics, neuro/neuranatomy, Immunology + weak topics)
* **Dirty Medicine was clutch anytime I suddenly remembered a topic I should look over**
* **Divine Intervention podcast episodes 37 & 97** were big for me as I drove 2.5 hours to my testing location the night before.
* I also listened to about **4 hours (2 hrs on 2x speed) of random HY Divine Intervention eps** on topics I was weak on. Super high-yield and reinforces concepts quickly.
* Lay eyes on as many HY images and anatomy as possible - mainly through random youtube videos (at the gym, while cooking, anki, whatever...they basically give you the answer)
* Even just watching a 20-minute video or reading a 50-page HY doc on your weak points is 100% worth it. Don’t skip that stuff—you’d be surprised how many “one last review” facts end up on the test.

**Break Tip: Caffeine = Yes.**  
I'm a big coffee guy with a high tolerance and I usually drink coffee or Red Bull on practice tests but decided not to bring a second dose because I figured adrenaline and anxiety would clash too hard. Mistake. I had a cup in the morning, but by block 4, I was wishing I brought another upper. **If you’re a coffee person, bring your fuel even if you don't use it, or just ""micro-dose it during breaks"".**

**🎯 Final Thoughts:**

* Step 1 felt like:
   * 20% freebies (as long as you actually came prepared),
   * 20% logic-based (“you can figure it out”),
   * 20% tougher but doable with brainpower and you might have an epiphany,
   * 30% were coin flips between two okay-looking answers.
   * **There really were not that many ""I have no idea what are these words"" style questions (10%)**
* I genuinely have no clue how I did overall… but at least I *felt nice about* block 6 and 7. Hoping for the best 🙏

I managed to keep the service running using free tools and whatever resources I could gather, piecing everything together with what was available.

I have step back from the project. One of the main motivation for this decision was that some users were excessively downloading content, which put a strain on our shared resources and made it difficult to sustain the service for everyone and the move of site providers to charge hosting .

Fortunately, our friend  u/Capable_Tea3037 has since taken the reins  for the better and has done a fantastic job, regularly adding new features and updates. As he’s mentioned before, keeping Calishot running does come with real costs, such as a Shodan subscription to source new content, server hosting, ...

He’s reached out a few times asking for a bit of support from the community. If just 100 people contributed $1 per month, it would make a huge difference. He’s not looking to get rich, but just hoping for a little encouragement and help to continue offering this service to all of you.

If, at any point, our current maintainer decides to step away, please be aware that I won’t be able to take over his wonderful work, and I'm not certain that anyone else will step in to carry the torch, either.

So please, if you find value in this project, [CONSIDER DONATING](https://www.reddit.com/r/opencalibre/comments/1lg6kz4/buy_me_a_coffee/) to him. Just a dollar per month from hundreds of you can keep Calishot alive and growing. Every contribution counts and brings us closer to a sustainable future for this community.

Now I’m thinking, these past 2 weeks I’ve had a random obsession with SALT. I put a crazy amount  of crazy on everything.. (including my coffee), I thought I had my period June 22-24 but maybe it wasn’t. It was extremely light, I only use liners bc it was extremely light. I don’t remember my last period bc I’m irregular. 

So has anyone else had gum swelling as an early sign of pregnant? 

I’m going to take a test first thing in the morning. I’m excited!!! Idk why but I am!!! ",0,1752279549.0,amipregnant,1,0.5,False

I wasn't turning down the street I grew up on. I wasn't standing near the large oak in the front yard of the house where I'd lost all my baby teeth. I wasn't sitting inside the kitchen, where, on my fifteenth birthday, I accidentally dropped the cake my mom had baked, which made my family laugh so hard that we shed tears. No. I was holding an oil painting at a Goodwill on the other side of the country.

""That can't be possible,"" my husband said.

""It can be possible, Parker, because I'm holding the flipping painting and telling you.""

""One, language. Two, can I say something without you jumping down my throat?"" Parker asked, his voice even.

""Yes,"" I said.

""Is there an outside chance that this just looks like your childhood home? I mean, you grew up in the burbs. A lot of cookie-cutter homes, no?""

I hated to admit he had a point. But as I stared at the house, I couldn't come around to that line of thinking. This was my house. Hell, the roses in the flower beds were the same size and color as I remembered them. ""No. I mean, I hear you and you're not off base. But, dude, this is my house."" I pointed at the porch. ""I broke that railing trying to do a ballet spin and fell into the bushes.""

""You? Miss Two Left Feet? Senorita Trips-a-lot? Tried to do a ballet spin?""

""To be fair, I did the spin. I just didn't stick the landing.""

""A minor detail in the world of dance. The landing part.""

""I landed…on the bushes right here,"" I said, pointing to the painting. ""Hold on, I have to send a photo to my mom.""

""Does she have old house photos?""

""Of course she does. You've met her, right?""

I had Parker hold the painting and snapped a few pictures. I sent them over to Mom and asked if she had a photo to compare it to. The message came back a minute later. ""OMG! That's our house! Weird."" Another ding brought us a house photo. It looked exactly like the artwork in my hand.

I showed Parker. ""Christ,"" he said. ""That's it.""

""Told you.""

""That's wild. Is it a print or a real painting?""

I ran my hand across the art. There was a palpable texture to the brush strokes. Sometimes, a print may have varnish applied to give the impression of brushstrokes. This wasn't that. ""I think this is real, but let me check something else,"" I said, walking toward the wall of ugly lamps.

I turned on a lamp and held the painting in front of the bulb. Some artists will draw the picture first in pencil before painting. Sometimes, you can see those marks when you hold it up to the light. Staring at the oak tree in the painting, I saw graphite streaks underneath.

""It's real,"" I declared.

""Who painted it?""

A slash of red paint in the corner mimicked a signature, but Parker and I stared at it as if it were written in Minoan Linear A. Parker traced the paint with his finger. Forwards and backwards. ""The first name may be George or Jeff? I think George. Look at how it flows."" He retraced the letters, and it made sense to me.

""Okay, what's the last name?""

""Hell if I know.""

I tried Parker's finger tracing. It felt like I was tracing a line drawing by someone with too much caffeine in their system. These didn't seem like actual letters.

""Might be Moffit,"" a soft voice said from behind us.

We turned and saw that a Goodwill employee had materialized. She was a short, frail-looking elderly woman with a hairstyle that resembled a well-constructed cumulus cloud in both color and shape.

""Moffit?"" I said.

""I think that's an 'm',"" she said, pointing to two humps. ""Then it kind of circles into an 'o' and the double fs. The 'I' and the 't' are somewhat stylized, I think. Artists being artists.""

I looked and, yeah, it kinda looked like Moffit. ""I can see it. George Moffit, you think?""

""I do. Beautiful piece. Don't you think?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""It looks exactly like the house I grew up in."" I showed her the photo my mom sent.

""How strange!""

""Right? I grew up across the country. Why is this even here?""

""When I was younger, there was a company that would paint your home for you.""

""Painters?"" Parker deadpanned.

""Ignore him,"" I said. ""He doesn't know how to act in public.""

She laughed. ""I understand. I have one just like him at home. That's why he's at home.""

I laughed. ""You're teaching and I'm taking notes, ma'am.""

""Anyway, they would come paint portraits of your house. It was a thing for a few years. This looks like one of those. There may be a company name on the back, under the frame.""

I flipped the painting over and gingerly removed the frame. Sure enough, there was a small, faded sticker that read ""Cozy Home Portraits Company."" There wasn't any other information. I made an impressed noise. ""Look at that. Have a jumping off point to find out what this is all about. Thank you so much….""

""Marge.""

""Marge, thank you. Sorry again for this guy.""

""Marge, please forgive me. You're a gentlewoman and a scholar.""

Marge leaned into him and nodded at me. ""You're punching above your weight with her, kiddo. Keep her happy.""

Parker laughed, wrapped his arm around my hip, and pulled me in for a hug. ""Marge, that's the best advice I've ever received from a Goodwill employee.""

""If only your barber had given you good advice. You could've avoided that haircut.""

I burst out laughing. Parker did too. ""Marge, I hope to grow up to be just like you.""

""You found a guy who can take a joke. That's a start. You guys wanna get that or still debating?""

I looked at Parker, and he nodded. ""How can we not get this? Even if it's just for the story.""

Marge smiled. ""See, you can learn. Come on, kids. I'll ring you up.""

When I got home, I immediately began researching the Cozy Home Portraits Company. I had a hard time finding anything. Most of the search results were links to people on Reddit asking the same questions. Apparently, there were a lot of folks like me who were surprised to find their childhood homes immortalized on canvas. One commenter said something that stuck with me.

""Parker, listen to this,"" I said, reading the post. ""My mom says she remembers someone approaching her and asking if they could take a photo so they could paint the house later. She told them no at first, but they said they'd do it for no cost. Mom agreed and assumed she'd get the painting at some point, but she never heard from the company again.""

""What's the next commenter say?""

""This sounds fake,"" I read. ""Kind of a dickish response, no?""

""It's Reddit,"" he said, shrugging. ""Maybe they just used the houses for inspiration and sold the paintings to commercial houses for reproductions?""

""Then why bother involving the homeowners at all?""

""Maybe to assuage their worries of someone standing outside their home snapping photos of their house?"" Parker suggested.

""I mean, anyone could take a photo of our house, and I'd have no idea unless I saw them do it.""

""True. It's weird, I'll grant you, but I think I'm on the right track. Commercial art. Americana stuff. That was to be it.""

He may have been onto something, but that answer didn't feel right. I couldn't work out the logic. If this company had been around for a while and painted portraits of homes all across the country for commercial sale, why wasn't there any record of them? No stories online. No official business records. No known CEO or lists of artists or anyone. Hell, even searching for the name George Moffit didn't yield results.

My mind told me there was something off about this. A sense of dread loomed over the whole thing. I let it marinate all day to see if I'd reconsider. Shocking no one, I didn't. I told Parker as much as we got ready for bed.

""You're reacting that way because of what's happening in the world right now,"" Parker said, yawning. ""There are real evil people out there, but they aren't painting pictures.""

""Hitler painted pictures,"" I said.

He gave me a deadpan stare. ""You know what I mean.""

""I just can't let it go. It's odd. Odd that it was done at all. Odd that it traveled all the way out here. Odd that I found it. Odd stacked on odd stack on odd.""

""Turtles all the way down.""

""What?"" I said, crinkling up my face. ""What do turtles have to do with anything?""

He laughed. ""Nothing. Just a dumb expression."" He yawned again. ""Why is this bothering you so much?""

""Some random company painted and sold pictures of my childhood house with no one knowing about it. It's….""

""Odd,"" he said with a smile.

""Very. It's just not sitting right with me.""

Parker yawned for a third time. ""My melatonin is kicking in here. Get some rest and see how you feel in the morning. Maybe call your mom, see if she has a story to tell. She might know something.""

He didn't wait for my response. Instead, he rolled over, shut off the lamp, and turned on our sound machine. As digital thunderstorms rolled into our bedroom, I lay down on my pillows but didn't fall asleep. This whole thing smothered my thoughts as much as my weighted blanket did my body.

I would call Mom tomorrow. See what she knew. If anything. I heard light snores coming from Parker's direction and sighed. That man could fall asleep even if the house were on fire. I flipped on YouTube, found something to help me sleep, and closed my eyes.

Or would have, if I hadn't seen our front porch light turn on.

A cold touched my brain and froze the rest of my body. The light going off didn't mean a prowler was trying to jimmy open our lock. It could be a bug flying too close to the sensor or a sleepwalking squirrel. Improbable? Sure, but they were better than the alternative. I didn't want to wake Parker, but I also wasn't keen on investigating alone.

While I was debating getting out of bed, I heard a noise in the kitchen. That made the decision easy. I elbowed Parker. ""What?"" he asked, his voice a blend of exhaustion and annoyance.

""Our front porch light went off,"" I whispered.

""Raccoons tripping the light,"" he said. ""Not worth waking me.""

""I know, but…but I heard someone in the kitchen.""

His eyes zinged open. In a flash, he was on his feet and grabbed the bat we kept near the bed. He quietly inched along the wall until he got to the bedroom doorway. He peeked out and scanned the room before turning back to me and shrugging.

I pointed to the kitchen again before popping up and joining him on the wall. Parker wasn't pleased. He told me, not in words but vigorous nods, to go back to the bed and wait. I didn't. He gave in, and we made our way out of the bedroom. Me walking directly behind him like some backwards waltz.

I saw nothing. That went double after Parker slammed his hand on the switch, flooding the room with light and damn near blinding me in the process. I let out a painful yelp and covered my eyes to adjust. I heard Parker sigh.

""We're good,"" he said. ""Nothing in here.""

""You gotta tell me before you do that,"" I said, finally checking out the room. Everything initially looked washed out. ""I'm nearly blind.""

""I wanted the element of surprise,"" Parker said.

""You achieved it,"" I said. ""All I see now are a bunch of little diamonds everywhere.""

He walked into the kitchen. ""Your intruder is nothing more than a fallen salt shaker,"" he said, holding up the culprit.

""Oh.""

""Like I said, a raccoon probably tripped the light. I'm going back to sleep. You should, too.""

He walked past me, patted my ass, and headed back to bed. I was about to join him when my eyes landed on the painting. I walked over to it and stared. In the store, looking at it had flooded my emotions with joy and happiness. But now? None of that.

Unease seeped into my blood and rushed through my body. Something was different about the painting. I couldn't put my finger on what had changed, but I knew something had. It was giving me chills. I grabbed a nearby napkin and draped it over the artwork like a coroner covering a dead body. My thinking was that if there was something supernatural about this thing, the napkin would keep it at bay.

Dumb, I know, but it made sense at the time.

""I couldn't believe that picture. That's so wild."" Mom was too chipper for this early in the morning. She always was, though. A real 'rise with the early bird' kind of gal.

That wasn't me. I still had bedhead as I sipped my cup of coffee. Parker, another early riser, cooked breakfast. ""I thought so too. Someone told me a company used to go around and paint pictures of homes. They'd ask the homeowners beforehand. Any memory of that?""

""Not that I can remember. Back then, it was mostly your father who spoke with salesmen. I found them unseemly. I can't imagine he'd allow someone to do that, rest his soul.""

""Yeah. Dad was pretty private.""

""We had a neighbor who was a painter, though. Carl, no, that wasn't it. Craig! Craig…aww goddamn my ancient brain. Bonnie, don't get old. It's hell.""

""I'm trying not to. It's why I do my nightly skincare routine.""

""It's intense,"" Parker added with a smirk.

""What was his name? It's been years since I thought of him. Craig…Morris? Something like that. He didn't live near us for long. Dad didn't like him. At all.""

""Why?""

""Craig was the human equivalent of a popcorn kernel stuck in your teeth. Irritating. He rubbed your father the wrong way.""

""I don't remember Dad talking about him.""

""He didn't around you, but with me, hoo boy. Craig used to walk by the house all the time, always whistling 'pop goes the weasel' for some reason. He'd stand too close when he talked to you. He'd leer at me when I was outside hanging laundry on the line. He'd never get the hint that I wanted to be left alone, even though I was always short with him. Especially after he said that you were growing up nicely.""

""Gross,"" I said. ""I was ten.""

""Like I said, he was a weirdo. But, again, most artiste types are, I suppose. Remember your Uncle Walter? Made those ghastly papier mache skulls. They used to be all over his house. Was like walking into some cannibal's hut whenever we'd go over there. But he was good at making them. Who'd want them is another thing altogether. He gave us one, and I made your dad keep it in a bag in the garage. 'Don't bring that ghoulish shit in my house.'""

As my mom rambled about skull shapes like a Victorian phrenologist, a thought came to me. I looked down at the painting and traced the painter's name. ""Mom, could his name have been Craig Moffit?""

Parker looked over at me. I nodded down at the painting and traced what I thought the letters were with my finger. He hit his forehead with the spatula and shook his head.

""OH MY GOD! Yes! That was it! Craig Moffit. God, what a blast from the past. He really was a weird little freak of a man,"" my mom said, laughing. ""He used to wear these tiny little shorts, and he did *not* have the legs for it. Looked like two toothpicks stuck in an orange.""

Mom droned on a little longer, but provided nothing of substance beyond Craig Moffit's horrid legs. But she'd given me some new information - the artist's real name. As soon as I hung up, I grabbed my laptop.

""Craig Moffit! Not George! Craig!""

""I see it now,"" Parker said. ""We should've never trusted Marge. Didn't like the cut of her jib.""

""Babe, her jib was flawless,"" I said, turning to the painting. ""Her eyes, not so much.""

""To be fair, we all agreed it was George Moffit….""

""There! There's Craig Moffit!"" I turned the computer around and showed a webpage dedicated to his art. Parker leaned down to get a closer look.

""His legs do look like toothpicks stuck in an orange.""

Rolling my eyes, I turned the laptop back to me and clicked on the man's ""About Me"" page. It was illuminating. Craig had quite the little career. He'd worked for a few newspaper outlets. A few magazines. Some ad campaigns. His stuff was good. There was a list of known works.

""There are a few house paintings listed here. It has to be him.""

""Has anyone mentioned how odd this is?"" Parker said with a sly smile.

""It's catching on.""

""Maybe he saw your home as a happy family home and wanted to capture it for that company. Is there a contact page?""

""There is!"" I yelped. I read the page out loud. ""If you have questions about Craig or his work, please feel free to reach out here,"" I said.

""That's great. You can email him and ask directly.""

""Moffit estate at Moffit art dot com,"" I read. ""Shit. He's dead.""

""That shouldn't matter. Maybe the guy who runs the estate can answer your questions?""

I nodded. It was worth a shot. I started composing a message, and Parker went back to breakfast. I glanced at the artwork on the table next to me. Something about it picked at my brain.

""Hey, I meant to ask, have you been watching professional Wiffle ball games on our YouTube?""

""Oh, yeah. I've started turning on games after your melatonin kicks in. Puts me right out.""

""Uh-huh. Are you a Wiffle ball fan?""

""No,"" I said, laughing. ""I just happened across it one night, and I fell asleep like ten minutes into a game. It's better than ocean waves. Which game was it?""

""Umm, Rhinos against the….""

""Storks? Oh man, those two teams hate each other. Storks have won the last three series behind Dustin Braddock's nasty banana ball…."" I stopped speaking because I could feel Parker's smug smirk on his face. I looked up and caught it with my own eyes. ""Not a fan.""

""What the hell is a banana ball?""

PING!

""They emailed back already,"" I said. ""What the hell?""

""Maybe there isn't a lot going on at the Moffit estate?""

""Hi, Craig Moffit was my father. He did several pieces of local homes during that era. I would love to discuss this with you. Can we set up a call?""

""So there clearly isn't a lot going on at the Moffit estate,"" Parker said.

""I'm going to say yes. I think I have to, if for no other reason than my own sanity.""

""Go for it. I can be there for the call if you need me.""

So I set up a call with the estate for later that day. Hopefully, there'd be some information that I could use to stop the itch in my brain. Parker served me breakfast before he got ready to head out to the gym.

""You never told me what a banana ball is,"" he said, placing the plate in front of me.

""It's a side arm slurve. A strikeout pitch. Nearly unhittable if Braddock is on his game."" Parker gave me a quizzical look. I sighed. ""Not a fan.""

After Parker had left for the gym, I went back over to the painting. It was still sitting in the last place I had left it. Still had the napkin over it. The bad vibes I felt earlier were still there. In fact, they'd grown worse. I didn't even want this thing in my house anymore - covered or not.

Despite my misgivings, I pulled the napkin off the painting and gave it a once-over. I felt my stomach gurgle, and my throat went dry. Looking at this now literally caused physical pain. It didn't make sense.

""Where's the front door?"" I suddenly asked myself out loud.

The front door of the house was gone. Blacked out like an actor with perfect teeth coloring in one to look sufficiently destitute for a role. I scraped where the door had been with my thumb. No fresh paint. It was like it had always been that way. But it hadn't. I checked the photo I sent to my mom to confirm.

""What in the….""

There was a creak on the basement stairs. There very much shouldn't have been a creak on the basement stairs. The basement was home to nothing but dust, Christmas decorations, and my ugly childhood couches we didn't have the heart to throw away. Since none of those things can walk, this made no sense.

I tiptoed to the knife block and pulled out a butcher knife. With my phone in my free hand, I used my nimble thumb to unlock it. I was ready to dial 911. But, as I stared at my reflection in the knife blade, I questioned whether I was prepared to stick it into another person. I wouldn't know that until it came to that moment. I very much prayed that wouldn't happen.

Another creak. Near the top of the stairs now. It was getting closer. I flexed the grip on the knife. I tried to control my breathing, but couldn't. Turns out all that woo-woo TikTok relaxation breathing stuff was just bullshit. My heart was thumping like an angry jazz drummer's long-awaited solo. I felt sweat drip down my neck.

Something flickered on the painting. It momentarily took my eyes off the basement door. Like last night, I initially registered nothing different. Then I noticed. Through the window of the living room, it looked like someone had turned on a light or lit a fire. Splotches of yellow and orange paint filled the window frame.

The jingling of the basement door handle snapped me out of my trance. My palms were sweaty. My legs swayed like bamboo in a strong breeze. I gathered all my remaining strength and yelled out, ""Hey! St-stay away from me!"" I wanted to say more, but overwhelming fear shut me up.

The jiggling stopped. Relief. My hectoring worked...for about two seconds. The basement door cracked open. There was a ghostly, pale face staring back at me. That was when my brain firmly decided whether I was a fight-or-flight kinda gal.

I was flight.

""Fuck this."" I dropped the knife, which clattered on the tile like that drummer hitting the high-hat, and sprinted toward my front door. I yelled gibberish the entire time, tears streaming down my face, and blasted out of the door. My fingers hit send on the call, and seconds later, an annoyingly even-keeled 911 operator connected me with the police.

Parker returned home before the police arrived. He found me sitting inside my locked car. Before he could crack a joke, he caught sight of my face. I'd been crying and could feel how puffy my eyes were. Consternation crossed his face. I rolled the window down. ""Get in the car.""

He did. I explained everything to him. He was astonished. He was confused. He grabbed my hand and held it steady as I went over everything, pausing occasionally to sob like a child with a skinned knee. When I was done, he asked why I didn't leave right away.

""Who do you think you are, Rambo?""

I laughed. I need that. ""For a few seconds, I was. Then I wasn't. I wasn't even Gizmo pretending to be Rambo.""

He gave my arm a loving squeeze. ""If it'll help you calm down, we can watch some pro Wiffle ball tonight. I hear the Rhinos are playing the Turkeys.""

""Storks,"" I said, ""but they are actually playing the Habaneros tonight. Gil Faust is looking to debut his 'chili ball' pitch.""

He leaned in and kissed my forehead. ""But you're not a fan.""

""I'm not.""

A knock on the window caused me to scream. The cops had arrived. If they were curious why we were sitting in our car, they kept it to themselves. I relayed what happened, and they said they'd go into the basement and check it out.

Fifteen minutes later, they came walking out. ""We didn't see anyone down there,"" the Cop said. ""But, to be fair to you, your basement gave me the heebie-jeebies.""

""Great,"" I said.

""I know it's not what you wanted to hear, but it's the truth. On the plus side, I haven't seen that love seat since I was a kid.""

""Want it?""

""It's better left to the past. You two have a nice day.""

We watched them leave. Parker turned to me. ""You okay?""

""No, and I won't be until I go into the basement myself.""

""What? Why?""

""I…I can't explain. Something is drawing me there. It sounds crazy, I know, but I feel it in my bones.""

Parker saw the determined look in my eyes. This was going to happen. Had to happen. He sighed. ""Want me to go in first?""

""Yes,"" I said.

""Are you actually going to wait for me to go in or follow right behind me?""

""We both know the answer to that.""

Resuming our reverse waltz, we went back into the house. Once in the kitchen, we stopped near the painting. Parker looked over and agreed that there were changes. We turned our attention to the closed basement door. Parker put his hand on the handle.

""We don't have to go down here, Beth,"" he said. ""The cops didn't find anyone.""

""Alive. If there's a ghost in this house, I need to know. If we know, we can remove it.""

""How?""

""I'm still working on that part,"" I said. ""But I need to know for certain. I won't feel safe otherwise.""

""I'm inclined to just say yes and move on. Something altered the painting already. Who the hell did that?""

""One issue at a time,"" I said.

He knew he couldn't talk his way out of this. He knew I needed this, and he loved me enough to see it through to the end. Even though he was petrified, too. The skin on his arm had goosebumps as soon as we walked into the kitchen. It felt like braille to me now, and the only thing it said was ""let's not do this.""

But that feeling in my brain, the one drawing me down there, wouldn't leave. It was stronger now that we were in the home. Something was loose in my house. I knew it in my heart. Whatever it was, I needed to keep it from roosting in my new home. Let the ghosts live in the past. Leave my future alone.

Parker gripped the handle, sighed so loudly it was heard two towns over, and opened the door. The stairs led down into the dark of the basement. The floor around the landing was the only thing visible. In the abstract, it wasn't anything. Right now, though? Horrifying.

Parker found the light switch, illuminating the rest of the space. So far, so good. We took our time walking down the stairs. Creaking along the wooden one step at a time. Maybe it'd have the same effect on the ghost that hearing creaking steps did on me. Perhaps the phantom was hiding, holding a ghost knife and deciding if it was going to play ghost Rambo or just fearfully disappear into the walls.

""The house in the painting had a basement, too,"" I whispered. ""When I was a kid, I hated going down there. Any time of day. Just didn't feel natural, ya know?""

""Are you trying to get me to stop doing this?""

""Sorry, I'm rambling,"" I said. I kept right on rambling, though. ""What bothered me wasn't so much going down there. What scared me was the trip back up. Turning your back on the dark. I used to walk backwards up the stairs.""

""We can try that in a few minutes,"" Parker whispered back. ""Any other ghost stories you want to share before we hit the landing?""

""Sorry,"" I said. ""It just popped into my mind. I haven't thought about that fear in years. Since we moved away from there, actually.""

""That's not comforting.""

We got to the bottom and took a look around. Everything looked normal. No surprises. Just our old, ugly furniture and friendly Santa decorations smiling and giving us a frozen wave.

I thought about turning and heading back up, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was supposed to be down here. I was also positive Parker would be furious if I went darting up the stairs without him. Leaving him alone in Spook Central might be grounds for divorce.

We headed over to the furniture. There was a layer of dust on everything. I smacked the pillow, sending it flying into the air. I coughed and sneezed, instantly regretting my actions. Parker's withering glare told me he wasn't fond of my actions either.

""Sorry.""

""I don't see anything out of the ordinary here, do you?""

""No,"" I said. ""It looks like it always does.""

""Feeling gone? Can we go back upstairs now?""

Before I could answer, we heard the familiar chime from our security system, followed by the calm, reassuring voice informing us that our front door was open.

""What the fuck?"" I said.

""Shhh,"" Parker responded, his finger to his lips. He pointed up to the ceiling. We cocked our ears and concentrated. For about twenty seconds, there was nothing. Silence. It didn't last.

CREAAAAK.

The floorboards wheezed as someone took slow, deliberate steps above us. You could hear the footfalls as they moved from the front door to the hallway. Trembling, Parker pointed up at the ceiling. You could physically see the floor bow ever so slightly from the person's weight. I didn't even think that was possible.

""W-what do we do?"" I whispered.

""I don't know,"" Parker said. ""Maybe they'll leave?""

A second later, we were cloaked in total darkness. All the power in the house had gone out. The only light came from the sunlight streaming in from the open door at the top of the stairs. It wasn't much, but it was a beacon. Our lighthouse. Our way home.

""Let's…,"" is all I was able to say. Someone upstairs ran down the hall, through the kitchen, and to the basement door. They slammed it shut, plunging us into instant midnight.

I wanted to scream. To yell so loud it'd shake the heavens. But I couldn't. My body physically couldn't make that happen. It'd give away our location. I clutched Parker's shirt so hard I was afraid I'd rip it right off him. If it bothered him, he didn't say.

""This sucks,"" Parker mumbled. Understatement of the goddamn century.

""HO HO HO MERRY CHRISTMAS!"" One of our Santa decorations started going off. I nearly peed myself at Santa's sudden arrival. I imagined it would've been the same response I would've had if I had seen him as a kid.

Kris Kringle was soon joined by all of our Christmas decorations going off at once. Dozens of laughing Santas, lights flickering off and on, inflatables rising like zombified plastic bags. The noise was deafening, but strangely festive. The strobing lights in the pitch black caused afterimages to dance in my rods and cones. I slammed them shut and silently prayed for this all to end.

Someone must've heard because, as quickly as they'd come to life, they stopped.

We stood in the dark, not breathing. Not moving. Neither of us knew what to do. Nothing in my life had prepared me for this. I couldn't shake the idea that whatever was coming would be worse than what we'd already experienced.

There was a creaking again and a sudden rushing of blinding sunlight from the top of the stairs. Someone had opened the door. Before we could get a glimpse, the door slammed shut, and something sprinted down the now-dark stairs.

I pulled Parker back onto the old love seat. We sat on the edge and kept our heads on a swivel, even though the basement was too dark to see our own hands. We weren't alone anymore.

As my fingertips grazed the couch, I realized something. These were originally my parents. My parents got them when I was living in the house from the painting. They were a physical connection between the past and now. Are these what caused my sudden desire to come to the basement? Was I being manipulated by this thing?

Could I trust myself at all?

That dread feeling I'd had since I brought the painting into our house intensified. I felt it in my bones. Deeper even. My aura. My soul.

I leaned into Parker's ear and whispered an apology. He didn't vocalize a response, but squeezed my arm. I squeezed back. My body shook, and I couldn't get myself to stop. I wanted to run for the stairs, but that old fear came rushing back.

I knew if I ran up those stairs, it'd follow behind me.

Something wooshed by us. My hair flowed with it, trailing behind whatever had sprinted past. I nervously dug my fingers into the fabric. We heard the sound of some liquid splattering on the floor across from us. Water? No. Heavier than water. A sound that made my guts twist soon joined the drips and splashes.

Someone started whistling a familiar tune. Pop goes the weasel. The Christmas decorations flickered on and shut off. In the brief flash of light, we could make out a figure standing across from us.

Craig Moffit.

""POP!"" he screamed as the lights strobed.

""GOES!"" he screamed again, a foot closer this time.

""THE!"" Another foot closer. Almost directly in front of us now.

The lights flickered again, and his face was right next to mine. A sinister smile as he slowly whispered, ""weasel."" I felt something wet and slimy rub against my cheek.

Parker stood and, surprisingly, swung at ghost Craig. It didn't find the ghoul, and, as the darkness returned, his fist only found the arm of the couch. I heard his knuckles crack and him swear in pain.

My ears were the only thing working at that moment, though. I sat frozen, tears streaming down my face. The lights in the house came back on, and I screamed.

On the wall across from us, where we had heard the water, the painting was hanging. Only, it wasn't the old house. It was the current house. All the windows and doors were filled with flames. There were two figures on the front lawn. Parker and I. We were both dead. Standing behind our oak tree, watching it all, was Craig Moffit.

""Parker! Let's go!""

I didn't have to tell him twice. We broke for the stairs and took them three at a time until we reached the top. I grabbed the handle and shoved my shoulder into the door, expecting it to hold firm. It didn't. Parker and I spilled onto our kitchen floor.

I scrambled up and practically yanked Parker into the kitchen. I was about to slam the door when I saw Craig Moffit standing at the bottom of the stairs. We locked eyes. My mind flew back to my childhood. A memory stored deep in the folds of my brain. I was sitting on our porch reading a book and heard that damn whistling.

Craig Moffit. A Polaroid camera in his hands and portrait photos on his mind. I was afraid he'd stop and take a picture of me. I was right. Even now, I could hear the heavy clunk of the shutter and the whirring of the processing photo as it slid out. He shook it, and as the fog of war slowly dissipated on the photo, he smiled.

""This way, I won't forget you.""

I slammed the door shut and urged Parker to grab the car keys. He turned the corner to do so when I heard him sharply yelp in surprise, followed by the squeak of his sneakers on the hardwood and his ass hitting the ground. I ran to him expecting to see Craig, but was stunned by the sight of a living man surrounded by two yellow hulks outside my front door.

Once my brain processed the information, it was clear those men were wearing biohazard suits. It still didn't answer why men in biohazard suits were outside my door. But it cleared up that there were. The suitless man in the middle, though, had a more than striking resemblance to the ghost I'd just seen in my basement. Only younger. Fuller. Fleshy.

""Sorry to startle you both,"" the man said, raising his hands in peace. ""You contacted us about a painting you found. I'm David Moffit. Craig was my father.""

""You've got to be shitting me.""

""We were supposed to talk on the phone,"" I said.

""Yes, but we were worried things might have progressed too much by then. Tell me, has the door in the painting disappeared yet?""

""How did….""

David turned to his men. ""Call for the extraction team."" Turning back to us, he urgently asked, ""Where's the painting?""

""The basement,"" I said. ""But it looks different now.""

""What in hell is going on?"" Parker asked.

""Different? Would you say *violently* different?""

""'Our-dead-bodies-on-the-lawn-and-the-place-ablaze' violently different.""

He nervously turned to where the biohazard-suited men had gone. ""The *experienced* extraction team!""

Parker stood and held my hand. We looked at each other and back at David Moffit. We both cracked. Small smiles that turned into chuckles that turned into a laughing fit. I read somewhere that mental breaks can start like this. Whatever. I leaned in.

""David Moffit, the son of your childhood painter neighbor Craig Moffit, himself a ghost that nearly killed us, is standing in our *fucking* veranda,"" Parker said, barely able to get the words out between screeching laughter. ""I mean, what the fuck is this life?""

Seconds later, a team of armed men in hazmat suits carrying unknown machinery rushed in and headed for the basement. We heard one of them scream, and then the sounds of mechanical engines warming up. David nodded toward the front door.

""We should go outside.""

We did. What the hell else were we going to do? Once we were outside, David pulled out a pack of cigarettes and offered us one. We both declined. David indulged and nodded back at the house. ""This is the experienced team.""

""What's going on?"" I asked.

""I'm going to level with you. What I'm about to say is pretty weird. I like to say weird to people. Sets the right tone.""

""Sir, on what is easily the weirdest day in not only my and my wife's life, but I'd argue humanity's life, nothing you can say will top what we've already been through,"" Parker said. ""I mean, I just discovered my wife watches professional Wiffle ball, for God's sake!""

""Not a fan,"" I mumbled.

""Dad was a strange man. Lots of demons. When he could keep them at bay, he did great work. But that was never for long. Around the time when you were a kid, he got deep into the occult. It was a faddish passing fancy at first, but soon he found a deeper meaning in it. It consumed him. Around this time, well, he conjured a demon.""

""I think I'm having a stroke.""

""He made a deal. We don't exactly know the details, but what we do know is that Dad agreed to start a company that would paint portraits of people's homes. The twist was that the homes he picked would become targets for the demon.""

""Naturally,"" Parker said. ""Because why not?""

""He'd take a photo of the home and give it to the demon. The demon would curse it and insert it into the canvases of my dad's paintings. These photos would be a connection between the subjects in the art and the demon itself. The pull got stronger when the artwork found its way back to the subjects. Then, they'd, well…."" He trailed off.

""Meet each other?"" I said.

""In a manner of speaking, yes.""

So many questions bounced around my brain. This all sounded so outlandish and yet…. The memory of the photo came back to me. ""This way, I won't forget you,"" I said out loud.

Confused, Parker looked at me. ""What?""

""We don't know how many paintings Dad did during this time, but we've recovered sixty-five in locations from New York to California. The people selected seemed to be random…except for you.""

""Why me?""

""My guess? You were neighbors and, well, my dad really didn't like your dad.""

""The feeling was mutual.""

Just then, the extraction team came rushing out. One was limping. The machines they brought looked broken, but the lights were still on. One of them had the painting in a bio-containment bag. It was smoking.

""The experienced team,"" David said, ashing out his smoke on the bottom of his shoe and pocketing the butt. ""Thank you for letting us help rid you of this…menace. The work is exhausting, but my family has to atone for Craig's wicked actions.""

David nodded and turned to leave. I reached out and grabbed his shoulder. ""Wait, that's it? We're free? Just like that.""

""Just like that,"" he said, turning to leave. He stopped and spun on his heels. ""Unless you have something from the old house in your new house. Then you kinda sorta leave a backdoor for the demon to return. So, if you do, I suggest destroying it."" He tipped his cap and left.

Parker and I locked eyes. ""The fucking love seat,"" we said at the same time. My back hurt just thinking about hauling it up those narrow stairs.

Later that night, we torched the sofa in a makeshift fire pit in our backyard. We ate pizza and watched the flames consume the potentially demonic couch. Can't imagine that's a sentence that's been said a lot in history. As we did, relief filled my heart. The dread was gone. I looked over at Parker and smiled.

""I think we can put to bed the argument about who had the weirder childhood, Park.""

He laughed. ""Yeah, summers with my Amish family can't compete with demons."" His phone buzzed. He looked down at the notification with concern. I felt my stomach twist.

""Please tell me it's good news.""

""The Rhinos/Habaneros game is about to start. I set a reminder. Wanna watch?""

I touched my heart and felt pure happiness surge through me. Tears. Grabbing his free hand, I held it tight and gave it a big squeeze. ""I have something to confess,"" I said. ""I think I'm a legitimate fan of professional Wiffle ball.""

""I know, babe. I know.""

We sat together, letting the crackling of a burning demon couch and the crack of a Wiffle ball bat fill the night air. I snuggled into Parker's shoulder. It was warm. Inviting. Home…and not one haunted by an angry ghost.

I wasn't turning down the street I grew up on. I wasn't standing near the large oak in the front yard of the house where I'd lost all my baby teeth. I wasn't sitting inside the kitchen, where, on my fifteenth birthday, I accidentally dropped the cake my mom had baked, which made my family laugh so hard that we shed tears. No. I was holding an oil painting at a Goodwill on the other side of the country.

""That can't be possible,"" my husband said.

""It can be possible, Parker, because I'm holding the flipping painting and telling you.""

""One, language. Two, can I say something without you jumping down my throat?"" Parker asked, his voice even.

""Yes,"" I said.

""Is there an outside chance that this just looks like your childhood home? I mean, you grew up in the burbs. A lot of cookie-cutter homes, no?""

I hated to admit he had a point. But as I stared at the house, I couldn't come around to that line of thinking. This was my house. Hell, the roses in the flower beds were the same size and color as I remembered them. ""No. I mean, I hear you and you're not off base. But, dude, this is my house."" I pointed at the porch. ""I broke that railing trying to do a ballet spin and fell into the bushes.""

""You? Miss Two Left Feet? Senorita Trips-a-lot? Tried to do a ballet spin?""

""To be fair, I did the spin. I just didn't stick the landing.""

""A minor detail in the world of dance. The landing part.""

""I landed…on the bushes right here,"" I said, pointing to the painting. ""Hold on, I have to send a photo to my mom.""

""Does she have old house photos?""

""Of course she does. You've met her, right?""

I had Parker hold the painting and snapped a few pictures. I sent them over to Mom and asked if she had a photo to compare it to. The message came back a minute later. ""OMG! That's our house! Weird."" Another ding brought us a house photo. It looked exactly like the artwork in my hand.

I showed Parker. ""Christ,"" he said. ""That's it.""

""Told you.""

""That's wild. Is it a print or a real painting?""

I ran my hand across the art. There was a palpable texture to the brush strokes. Sometimes, a print may have varnish applied to give the impression of brushstrokes. This wasn't that. ""I think this is real, but let me check something else,"" I said, walking toward the wall of ugly lamps.

I turned on a lamp and held the painting in front of the bulb. Some artists will draw the picture first in pencil before painting. Sometimes, you can see those marks when you hold it up to the light. Staring at the oak tree in the painting, I saw graphite streaks underneath.

""It's real,"" I declared.

""Who painted it?""

A slash of red paint in the corner mimicked a signature, but Parker and I stared at it as if it were written in Minoan Linear A. Parker traced the paint with his finger. Forwards and backwards. ""The first name may be George or Jeff? I think George. Look at how it flows."" He retraced the letters, and it made sense to me.

""Okay, what's the last name?""

""Hell if I know.""

I tried Parker's finger tracing. It felt like I was tracing a line drawing by someone with too much caffeine in their system. These didn't seem like actual letters.

""Might be Moffit,"" a soft voice said from behind us.

We turned and saw that a Goodwill employee had materialized. She was a short, frail-looking elderly woman with a hairstyle that resembled a well-constructed cumulus cloud in both color and shape.

""Moffit?"" I said.

""I think that's an 'm',"" she said, pointing to two humps. ""Then it kind of circles into an 'o' and the double fs. The 'I' and the 't' are somewhat stylized, I think. Artists being artists.""

I looked and, yeah, it kinda looked like Moffit. ""I can see it. George Moffit, you think?""

""I do. Beautiful piece. Don't you think?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""It looks exactly like the house I grew up in."" I showed her the photo my mom sent.

""How strange!""

""Right? I grew up across the country. Why is this even here?""

""When I was younger, there was a company that would paint your home for you.""

""Painters?"" Parker deadpanned.

""Ignore him,"" I said. ""He doesn't know how to act in public.""

She laughed. ""I understand. I have one just like him at home. That's why he's at home.""

I laughed. ""You're teaching and I'm taking notes, ma'am.""

""Anyway, they would come paint portraits of your house. It was a thing for a few years. This looks like one of those. There may be a company name on the back, under the frame.""

I flipped the painting over and gingerly removed the frame. Sure enough, there was a small, faded sticker that read ""Cozy Home Portraits Company."" There wasn't any other information. I made an impressed noise. ""Look at that. Have a jumping off point to find out what this is all about. Thank you so much….""

""Marge.""

""Marge, thank you. Sorry again for this guy.""

""Marge, please forgive me. You're a gentlewoman and a scholar.""

Marge leaned into him and nodded at me. ""You're punching above your weight with her, kiddo. Keep her happy.""

Parker laughed, wrapped his arm around my hip, and pulled me in for a hug. ""Marge, that's the best advice I've ever received from a Goodwill employee.""

""If only your barber had given you good advice. You could've avoided that haircut.""

I burst out laughing. Parker did too. ""Marge, I hope to grow up to be just like you.""

""You found a guy who can take a joke. That's a start. You guys wanna get that or still debating?""

I looked at Parker, and he nodded. ""How can we not get this? Even if it's just for the story.""

Marge smiled. ""See, you can learn. Come on, kids. I'll ring you up.""

When I got home, I immediately began researching the Cozy Home Portraits Company. I had a hard time finding anything. Most of the search results were links to people on Reddit asking the same questions. Apparently, there were a lot of folks like me who were surprised to find their childhood homes immortalized on canvas. One commenter said something that stuck with me.

""Parker, listen to this,"" I said, reading the post. ""My mom says she remembers someone approaching her and asking if they could take a photo so they could paint the house later. She told them no at first, but they said they'd do it for no cost. Mom agreed and assumed she'd get the painting at some point, but she never heard from the company again.""

""What's the next commenter say?""

""This sounds fake,"" I read. ""Kind of a dickish response, no?""

""It's Reddit,"" he said, shrugging. ""Maybe they just used the houses for inspiration and sold the paintings to commercial houses for reproductions?""

""Then why bother involving the homeowners at all?""

""Maybe to assuage their worries of someone standing outside their home snapping photos of their house?"" Parker suggested.

""I mean, anyone could take a photo of our house, and I'd have no idea unless I saw them do it.""

""True. It's weird, I'll grant you, but I think I'm on the right track. Commercial art. Americana stuff. That was to be it.""

He may have been onto something, but that answer didn't feel right. I couldn't work out the logic. If this company had been around for a while and painted portraits of homes all across the country for commercial sale, why wasn't there any record of them? No stories online. No official business records. No known CEO or lists of artists or anyone. Hell, even searching for the name George Moffit didn't yield results.

My mind told me there was something off about this. A sense of dread loomed over the whole thing. I let it marinate all day to see if I'd reconsider. Shocking no one, I didn't. I told Parker as much as we got ready for bed.

""You're reacting that way because of what's happening in the world right now,"" Parker said, yawning. ""There are real evil people out there, but they aren't painting pictures.""

""Hitler painted pictures,"" I said.

He gave me a deadpan stare. ""You know what I mean.""

""I just can't let it go. It's odd. Odd that it was done at all. Odd that it traveled all the way out here. Odd that I found it. Odd stacked on odd stack on odd.""

""Turtles all the way down.""

""What?"" I said, crinkling up my face. ""What do turtles have to do with anything?""

He laughed. ""Nothing. Just a dumb expression."" He yawned again. ""Why is this bothering you so much?""

""Some random company painted and sold pictures of my childhood house with no one knowing about it. It's….""

""Odd,"" he said with a smile.

""Very. It's just not sitting right with me.""

Parker yawned for a third time. ""My melatonin is kicking in here. Get some rest and see how you feel in the morning. Maybe call your mom, see if she has a story to tell. She might know something.""

He didn't wait for my response. Instead, he rolled over, shut off the lamp, and turned on our sound machine. As digital thunderstorms rolled into our bedroom, I lay down on my pillows but didn't fall asleep. This whole thing smothered my thoughts as much as my weighted blanket did my body.

I would call Mom tomorrow. See what she knew. If anything. I heard light snores coming from Parker's direction and sighed. That man could fall asleep even if the house were on fire. I flipped on YouTube, found something to help me sleep, and closed my eyes.

Or would have, if I hadn't seen our front porch light turn on.

A cold touched my brain and froze the rest of my body. The light going off didn't mean a prowler was trying to jimmy open our lock. It could be a bug flying too close to the sensor or a sleepwalking squirrel. Improbable? Sure, but they were better than the alternative. I didn't want to wake Parker, but I also wasn't keen on investigating alone.

While I was debating getting out of bed, I heard a noise in the kitchen. That made the decision easy. I elbowed Parker. ""What?"" he asked, his voice a blend of exhaustion and annoyance.

""Our front porch light went off,"" I whispered.

""Raccoons tripping the light,"" he said. ""Not worth waking me.""

""I know, but…but I heard someone in the kitchen.""

His eyes zinged open. In a flash, he was on his feet and grabbed the bat we kept near the bed. He quietly inched along the wall until he got to the bedroom doorway. He peeked out and scanned the room before turning back to me and shrugging.

I pointed to the kitchen again before popping up and joining him on the wall. Parker wasn't pleased. He told me, not in words but vigorous nods, to go back to the bed and wait. I didn't. He gave in, and we made our way out of the bedroom. Me walking directly behind him like some backwards waltz.

I saw nothing. That went double after Parker slammed his hand on the switch, flooding the room with light and damn near blinding me in the process. I let out a painful yelp and covered my eyes to adjust. I heard Parker sigh.

""We're good,"" he said. ""Nothing in here.""

""You gotta tell me before you do that,"" I said, finally checking out the room. Everything initially looked washed out. ""I'm nearly blind.""

""I wanted the element of surprise,"" Parker said.

""You achieved it,"" I said. ""All I see now are a bunch of little diamonds everywhere.""

He walked into the kitchen. ""Your intruder is nothing more than a fallen salt shaker,"" he said, holding up the culprit.

""Oh.""

""Like I said, a raccoon probably tripped the light. I'm going back to sleep. You should, too.""

He walked past me, patted my ass, and headed back to bed. I was about to join him when my eyes landed on the painting. I walked over to it and stared. In the store, looking at it had flooded my emotions with joy and happiness. But now? None of that.

Unease seeped into my blood and rushed through my body. Something was different about the painting. I couldn't put my finger on what had changed, but I knew something had. It was giving me chills. I grabbed a nearby napkin and draped it over the artwork like a coroner covering a dead body. My thinking was that if there was something supernatural about this thing, the napkin would keep it at bay.

Dumb, I know, but it made sense at the time.

""I couldn't believe that picture. That's so wild."" Mom was too chipper for this early in the morning. She always was, though. A real 'rise with the early bird' kind of gal.

That wasn't me. I still had bedhead as I sipped my cup of coffee. Parker, another early riser, cooked breakfast. ""I thought so too. Someone told me a company used to go around and paint pictures of homes. They'd ask the homeowners beforehand. Any memory of that?""

""Not that I can remember. Back then, it was mostly your father who spoke with salesmen. I found them unseemly. I can't imagine he'd allow someone to do that, rest his soul.""

""Yeah. Dad was pretty private.""

""We had a neighbor who was a painter, though. Carl, no, that wasn't it. Craig! Craig…aww goddamn my ancient brain. Bonnie, don't get old. It's hell.""

""I'm trying not to. It's why I do my nightly skincare routine.""

""It's intense,"" Parker added with a smirk.

""What was his name? It's been years since I thought of him. Craig…Morris? Something like that. He didn't live near us for long. Dad didn't like him. At all.""

""Why?""

""Craig was the human equivalent of a popcorn kernel stuck in your teeth. Irritating. He rubbed your father the wrong way.""

""I don't remember Dad talking about him.""

""He didn't around you, but with me, hoo boy. Craig used to walk by the house all the time, always whistling 'pop goes the weasel' for some reason. He'd stand too close when he talked to you. He'd leer at me when I was outside hanging laundry on the line. He'd never get the hint that I wanted to be left alone, even though I was always short with him. Especially after he said that you were growing up nicely.""

""Gross,"" I said. ""I was ten.""

""Like I said, he was a weirdo. But, again, most artiste types are, I suppose. Remember your Uncle Walter? Made those ghastly papier mache skulls. They used to be all over his house. Was like walking into some cannibal's hut whenever we'd go over there. But he was good at making them. Who'd want them is another thing altogether. He gave us one, and I made your dad keep it in a bag in the garage. 'Don't bring that ghoulish shit in my house.'""

As my mom rambled about skull shapes like a Victorian phrenologist, a thought came to me. I looked down at the painting and traced the painter's name. ""Mom, could his name have been Craig Moffit?""

Parker looked over at me. I nodded down at the painting and traced what I thought the letters were with my finger. He hit his forehead with the spatula and shook his head.

""OH MY GOD! Yes! That was it! Craig Moffit. God, what a blast from the past. He really was a weird little freak of a man,"" my mom said, laughing. ""He used to wear these tiny little shorts, and he did *not* have the legs for it. Looked like two toothpicks stuck in an orange.""

Mom droned on a little longer, but provided nothing of substance beyond Craig Moffit's horrid legs. But she'd given me some new information - the artist's real name. As soon as I hung up, I grabbed my laptop.

""Craig Moffit! Not George! Craig!""

""I see it now,"" Parker said. ""We should've never trusted Marge. Didn't like the cut of her jib.""

""Babe, her jib was flawless,"" I said, turning to the painting. ""Her eyes, not so much.""

""To be fair, we all agreed it was George Moffit….""

""There! There's Craig Moffit!"" I turned the computer around and showed a webpage dedicated to his art. Parker leaned down to get a closer look.

""His legs do look like toothpicks stuck in an orange.""

Rolling my eyes, I turned the laptop back to me and clicked on the man's ""About Me"" page. It was illuminating. Craig had quite the little career. He'd worked for a few newspaper outlets. A few magazines. Some ad campaigns. His stuff was good. There was a list of known works.

""There are a few house paintings listed here. It has to be him.""

""Has anyone mentioned how odd this is?"" Parker said with a sly smile.

""It's catching on.""

""Maybe he saw your home as a happy family home and wanted to capture it for that company. Is there a contact page?""

""There is!"" I yelped. I read the page out loud. ""If you have questions about Craig or his work, please feel free to reach out here,"" I said.

""That's great. You can email him and ask directly.""

""Moffit estate at Moffit art dot com,"" I read. ""Shit. He's dead.""

""That shouldn't matter. Maybe the guy who runs the estate can answer your questions?""

I nodded. It was worth a shot. I started composing a message, and Parker went back to breakfast. I glanced at the artwork on the table next to me. Something about it picked at my brain.

""Hey, I meant to ask, have you been watching professional Wiffle ball games on our YouTube?""

""Oh, yeah. I've started turning on games after your melatonin kicks in. Puts me right out.""

""Uh-huh. Are you a Wiffle ball fan?""

""No,"" I said, laughing. ""I just happened across it one night, and I fell asleep like ten minutes into a game. It's better than ocean waves. Which game was it?""

""Umm, Rhinos against the….""

""Storks? Oh man, those two teams hate each other. Storks have won the last three series behind Dustin Braddock's nasty banana ball…."" I stopped speaking because I could feel Parker's smug smirk on his face. I looked up and caught it with my own eyes. ""Not a fan.""

""What the hell is a banana ball?""

PING!

""They emailed back already,"" I said. ""What the hell?""

""Maybe there isn't a lot going on at the Moffit estate?""

""Hi, Craig Moffit was my father. He did several pieces of local homes during that era. I would love to discuss this with you. Can we set up a call?""

""So there clearly isn't a lot going on at the Moffit estate,"" Parker said.

""I'm going to say yes. I think I have to, if for no other reason than my own sanity.""

""Go for it. I can be there for the call if you need me.""

So I set up a call with the estate for later that day. Hopefully, there'd be some information that I could use to stop the itch in my brain. Parker served me breakfast before he got ready to head out to the gym.

""You never told me what a banana ball is,"" he said, placing the plate in front of me.

""It's a side arm slurve. A strikeout pitch. Nearly unhittable if Braddock is on his game."" Parker gave me a quizzical look. I sighed. ""Not a fan.""

After Parker had left for the gym, I went back over to the painting. It was still sitting in the last place I had left it. Still had the napkin over it. The bad vibes I felt earlier were still there. In fact, they'd grown worse. I didn't even want this thing in my house anymore - covered or not.

Despite my misgivings, I pulled the napkin off the painting and gave it a once-over. I felt my stomach gurgle, and my throat went dry. Looking at this now literally caused physical pain. It didn't make sense.

""Where's the front door?"" I suddenly asked myself out loud.

The front door of the house was gone. Blacked out like an actor with perfect teeth coloring in one to look sufficiently destitute for a role. I scraped where the door had been with my thumb. No fresh paint. It was like it had always been that way. But it hadn't. I checked the photo I sent to my mom to confirm.

""What in the….""

There was a creak on the basement stairs. There very much shouldn't have been a creak on the basement stairs. The basement was home to nothing but dust, Christmas decorations, and my ugly childhood couches we didn't have the heart to throw away. Since none of those things can walk, this made no sense.

I tiptoed to the knife block and pulled out a butcher knife. With my phone in my free hand, I used my nimble thumb to unlock it. I was ready to dial 911. But, as I stared at my reflection in the knife blade, I questioned whether I was prepared to stick it into another person. I wouldn't know that until it came to that moment. I very much prayed that wouldn't happen.

Another creak. Near the top of the stairs now. It was getting closer. I flexed the grip on the knife. I tried to control my breathing, but couldn't. Turns out all that woo-woo TikTok relaxation breathing stuff was just bullshit. My heart was thumping like an angry jazz drummer's long-awaited solo. I felt sweat drip down my neck.

Something flickered on the painting. It momentarily took my eyes off the basement door. Like last night, I initially registered nothing different. Then I noticed. Through the window of the living room, it looked like someone had turned on a light or lit a fire. Splotches of yellow and orange paint filled the window frame.

The jingling of the basement door handle snapped me out of my trance. My palms were sweaty. My legs swayed like bamboo in a strong breeze. I gathered all my remaining strength and yelled out, ""Hey! St-stay away from me!"" I wanted to say more, but overwhelming fear shut me up.

The jiggling stopped. Relief. My hectoring worked...for about two seconds. The basement door cracked open. There was a ghostly, pale face staring back at me. That was when my brain firmly decided whether I was a fight-or-flight kinda gal.

I was flight.

""Fuck this."" I dropped the knife, which clattered on the tile like that drummer hitting the high-hat, and sprinted toward my front door. I yelled gibberish the entire time, tears streaming down my face, and blasted out of the door. My fingers hit send on the call, and seconds later, an annoyingly even-keeled 911 operator connected me with the police.

Parker returned home before the police arrived. He found me sitting inside my locked car. Before he could crack a joke, he caught sight of my face. I'd been crying and could feel how puffy my eyes were. Consternation crossed his face. I rolled the window down. ""Get in the car.""

He did. I explained everything to him. He was astonished. He was confused. He grabbed my hand and held it steady as I went over everything, pausing occasionally to sob like a child with a skinned knee. When I was done, he asked why I didn't leave right away.

""Who do you think you are, Rambo?""

I laughed. I need that. ""For a few seconds, I was. Then I wasn't. I wasn't even Gizmo pretending to be Rambo.""

He gave my arm a loving squeeze. ""If it'll help you calm down, we can watch some pro Wiffle ball tonight. I hear the Rhinos are playing the Turkeys.""

""Storks,"" I said, ""but they are actually playing the Habaneros tonight. Gil Faust is looking to debut his 'chili ball' pitch.""

He leaned in and kissed my forehead. ""But you're not a fan.""

""I'm not.""

A knock on the window caused me to scream. The cops had arrived. If they were curious why we were sitting in our car, they kept it to themselves. I relayed what happened, and they said they'd go into the basement and check it out.

Fifteen minutes later, they came walking out. ""We didn't see anyone down there,"" the Cop said. ""But, to be fair to you, your basement gave me the heebie-jeebies.""

""Great,"" I said.

""I know it's not what you wanted to hear, but it's the truth. On the plus side, I haven't seen that love seat since I was a kid.""

""Want it?""

""It's better left to the past. You two have a nice day.""

We watched them leave. Parker turned to me. ""You okay?""

""No, and I won't be until I go into the basement myself.""

""What? Why?""

""I…I can't explain. Something is drawing me there. It sounds crazy, I know, but I feel it in my bones.""

Parker saw the determined look in my eyes. This was going to happen. Had to happen. He sighed. ""Want me to go in first?""

""Yes,"" I said.

""Are you actually going to wait for me to go in or follow right behind me?""

""We both know the answer to that.""

Resuming our reverse waltz, we went back into the house. Once in the kitchen, we stopped near the painting. Parker looked over and agreed that there were changes. We turned our attention to the closed basement door. Parker put his hand on the handle.

""We don't have to go down here, Beth,"" he said. ""The cops didn't find anyone.""

""Alive. If there's a ghost in this house, I need to know. If we know, we can remove it.""

""How?""

""I'm still working on that part,"" I said. ""But I need to know for certain. I won't feel safe otherwise.""

""I'm inclined to just say yes and move on. Something altered the painting already. Who the hell did that?""

""One issue at a time,"" I said.

He knew he couldn't talk his way out of this. He knew I needed this, and he loved me enough to see it through to the end. Even though he was petrified, too. The skin on his arm had goosebumps as soon as we walked into the kitchen. It felt like braille to me now, and the only thing it said was ""let's not do this.""

But that feeling in my brain, the one drawing me down there, wouldn't leave. It was stronger now that we were in the home. Something was loose in my house. I knew it in my heart. Whatever it was, I needed to keep it from roosting in my new home. Let the ghosts live in the past. Leave my future alone.

Parker gripped the handle, sighed so loudly it was heard two towns over, and opened the door. The stairs led down into the dark of the basement. The floor around the landing was the only thing visible. In the abstract, it wasn't anything. Right now, though? Horrifying.

Parker found the light switch, illuminating the rest of the space. So far, so good. We took our time walking down the stairs. Creaking along the wooden one step at a time. Maybe it'd have the same effect on the ghost that hearing creaking steps did on me. Perhaps the phantom was hiding, holding a ghost knife and deciding if it was going to play ghost Rambo or just fearfully disappear into the walls.

""The house in the painting had a basement, too,"" I whispered. ""When I was a kid, I hated going down there. Any time of day. Just didn't feel natural, ya know?""

""Are you trying to get me to stop doing this?""

""Sorry, I'm rambling,"" I said. I kept right on rambling, though. ""What bothered me wasn't so much going down there. What scared me was the trip back up. Turning your back on the dark. I used to walk backwards up the stairs.""

""We can try that in a few minutes,"" Parker whispered back. ""Any other ghost stories you want to share before we hit the landing?""

""Sorry,"" I said. ""It just popped into my mind. I haven't thought about that fear in years. Since we moved away from there, actually.""

""That's not comforting.""

We got to the bottom and took a look around. Everything looked normal. No surprises. Just our old, ugly furniture and friendly Santa decorations smiling and giving us a frozen wave.

I thought about turning and heading back up, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was supposed to be down here. I was also positive Parker would be furious if I went darting up the stairs without him. Leaving him alone in Spook Central might be grounds for divorce.

We headed over to the furniture. There was a layer of dust on everything. I smacked the pillow, sending it flying into the air. I coughed and sneezed, instantly regretting my actions. Parker's withering glare told me he wasn't fond of my actions either.

""Sorry.""

""I don't see anything out of the ordinary here, do you?""

""No,"" I said. ""It looks like it always does.""

""Feeling gone? Can we go back upstairs now?""

Before I could answer, we heard the familiar chime from our security system, followed by the calm, reassuring voice informing us that our front door was open.

""What the fuck?"" I said.

""Shhh,"" Parker responded, his finger to his lips. He pointed up to the ceiling. We cocked our ears and concentrated. For about twenty seconds, there was nothing. Silence. It didn't last.

CREAAAAK.

The floorboards wheezed as someone took slow, deliberate steps above us. You could hear the footfalls as they moved from the front door to the hallway. Trembling, Parker pointed up at the ceiling. You could physically see the floor bow ever so slightly from the person's weight. I didn't even think that was possible.

""W-what do we do?"" I whispered.

""I don't know,"" Parker said. ""Maybe they'll leave?""

A second later, we were cloaked in total darkness. All the power in the house had gone out. The only light came from the sunlight streaming in from the open door at the top of the stairs. It wasn't much, but it was a beacon. Our lighthouse. Our way home.

""Let's…,"" is all I was able to say. Someone upstairs ran down the hall, through the kitchen, and to the basement door. They slammed it shut, plunging us into instant midnight.

I wanted to scream. To yell so loud it'd shake the heavens. But I couldn't. My body physically couldn't make that happen. It'd give away our location. I clutched Parker's shirt so hard I was afraid I'd rip it right off him. If it bothered him, he didn't say.

""This sucks,"" Parker mumbled. Understatement of the goddamn century.

""HO HO HO MERRY CHRISTMAS!"" One of our Santa decorations started going off. I nearly peed myself at Santa's sudden arrival. I imagined it would've been the same response I would've had if I had seen him as a kid.

Kris Kringle was soon joined by all of our Christmas decorations going off at once. Dozens of laughing Santas, lights flickering off and on, inflatables rising like zombified plastic bags. The noise was deafening, but strangely festive. The strobing lights in the pitch black caused afterimages to dance in my rods and cones. I slammed them shut and silently prayed for this all to end.

Someone must've heard because, as quickly as they'd come to life, they stopped.

We stood in the dark, not breathing. Not moving. Neither of us knew what to do. Nothing in my life had prepared me for this. I couldn't shake the idea that whatever was coming would be worse than what we'd already experienced.

There was a creaking again and a sudden rushing of blinding sunlight from the top of the stairs. Someone had opened the door. Before we could get a glimpse, the door slammed shut, and something sprinted down the now-dark stairs.

I pulled Parker back onto the old love seat. We sat on the edge and kept our heads on a swivel, even though the basement was too dark to see our own hands. We weren't alone anymore.

As my fingertips grazed the couch, I realized something. These were originally my parents. My parents got them when I was living in the house from the painting. They were a physical connection between the past and now. Are these what caused my sudden desire to come to the basement? Was I being manipulated by this thing?

Could I trust myself at all?

That dread feeling I'd had since I brought the painting into our house intensified. I felt it in my bones. Deeper even. My aura. My soul.

I leaned into Parker's ear and whispered an apology. He didn't vocalize a response, but squeezed my arm. I squeezed back. My body shook, and I couldn't get myself to stop. I wanted to run for the stairs, but that old fear came rushing back.

I knew if I ran up those stairs, it'd follow behind me.

Something wooshed by us. My hair flowed with it, trailing behind whatever had sprinted past. I nervously dug my fingers into the fabric. We heard the sound of some liquid splattering on the floor across from us. Water? No. Heavier than water. A sound that made my guts twist soon joined the drips and splashes.

Someone started whistling a familiar tune. Pop goes the weasel. The Christmas decorations flickered on and shut off. In the brief flash of light, we could make out a figure standing across from us.

Craig Moffit.

""POP!"" he screamed as the lights strobed.

""GOES!"" he screamed again, a foot closer this time.

""THE!"" Another foot closer. Almost directly in front of us now.

The lights flickered again, and his face was right next to mine. A sinister smile as he slowly whispered, ""weasel."" I felt something wet and slimy rub against my cheek.

Parker stood and, surprisingly, swung at ghost Craig. It didn't find the ghoul, and, as the darkness returned, his fist only found the arm of the couch. I heard his knuckles crack and him swear in pain.

My ears were the only thing working at that moment, though. I sat frozen, tears streaming down my face. The lights in the house came back on, and I screamed.

On the wall across from us, where we had heard the water, the painting was hanging. Only, it wasn't the old house. It was the current house. All the windows and doors were filled with flames. There were two figures on the front lawn. Parker and I. We were both dead. Standing behind our oak tree, watching it all, was Craig Moffit.

""Parker! Let's go!""

I didn't have to tell him twice. We broke for the stairs and took them three at a time until we reached the top. I grabbed the handle and shoved my shoulder into the door, expecting it to hold firm. It didn't. Parker and I spilled onto our kitchen floor.

I scrambled up and practically yanked Parker into the kitchen. I was about to slam the door when I saw Craig Moffit standing at the bottom of the stairs. We locked eyes. My mind flew back to my childhood. A memory stored deep in the folds of my brain. I was sitting on our porch reading a book and heard that damn whistling.

Craig Moffit. A Polaroid camera in his hands and portrait photos on his mind. I was afraid he'd stop and take a picture of me. I was right. Even now, I could hear the heavy clunk of the shutter and the whirring of the processing photo as it slid out. He shook it, and as the fog of war slowly dissipated on the photo, he smiled.

""This way, I won't forget you.""

I slammed the door shut and urged Parker to grab the car keys. He turned the corner to do so when I heard him sharply yelp in surprise, followed by the squeak of his sneakers on the hardwood and his ass hitting the ground. I ran to him expecting to see Craig, but was stunned by the sight of a living man surrounded by two yellow hulks outside my front door.

Once my brain processed the information, it was clear those men were wearing biohazard suits. It still didn't answer why men in biohazard suits were outside my door. But it cleared up that there were. The suitless man in the middle, though, had a more than striking resemblance to the ghost I'd just seen in my basement. Only younger. Fuller. Fleshy.

""Sorry to startle you both,"" the man said, raising his hands in peace. ""You contacted us about a painting you found. I'm David Moffit. Craig was my father.""

""You've got to be shitting me.""

""We were supposed to talk on the phone,"" I said.

""Yes, but we were worried things might have progressed too much by then. Tell me, has the door in the painting disappeared yet?""

""How did….""

David turned to his men. ""Call for the extraction team."" Turning back to us, he urgently asked, ""Where's the painting?""

""The basement,"" I said. ""But it looks different now.""

""What in hell is going on?"" Parker asked.

""Different? Would you say *violently* different?""

""'Our-dead-bodies-on-the-lawn-and-the-place-ablaze' violently different.""

He nervously turned to where the biohazard-suited men had gone. ""The *experienced* extraction team!""

Parker stood and held my hand. We looked at each other and back at David Moffit. We both cracked. Small smiles that turned into chuckles that turned into a laughing fit. I read somewhere that mental breaks can start like this. Whatever. I leaned in.

""David Moffit, the son of your childhood painter neighbor Craig Moffit, himself a ghost that nearly killed us, is standing in our *fucking* veranda,"" Parker said, barely able to get the words out between screeching laughter. ""I mean, what the fuck is this life?""

Seconds later, a team of armed men in hazmat suits carrying unknown machinery rushed in and headed for the basement. We heard one of them scream, and then the sounds of mechanical engines warming up. David nodded toward the front door.

""We should go outside.""

We did. What the hell else were we going to do? Once we were outside, David pulled out a pack of cigarettes and offered us one. We both declined. David indulged and nodded back at the house. ""This is the experienced team.""

""What's going on?"" I asked.

""I'm going to level with you. What I'm about to say is pretty weird. I like to say weird to people. Sets the right tone.""

""Sir, on what is easily the weirdest day in not only my and my wife's life, but I'd argue humanity's life, nothing you can say will top what we've already been through,"" Parker said. ""I mean, I just discovered my wife watches professional Wiffle ball, for God's sake!""

""Not a fan,"" I mumbled.

""Dad was a strange man. Lots of demons. When he could keep them at bay, he did great work. But that was never for long. Around the time when you were a kid, he got deep into the occult. It was a faddish passing fancy at first, but soon he found a deeper meaning in it. It consumed him. Around this time, well, he conjured a demon.""

""I think I'm having a stroke.""

""He made a deal. We don't exactly know the details, but what we do know is that Dad agreed to start a company that would paint portraits of people's homes. The twist was that the homes he picked would become targets for the demon.""

""Naturally,"" Parker said. ""Because why not?""

""He'd take a photo of the home and give it to the demon. The demon would curse it and insert it into the canvases of my dad's paintings. These photos would be a connection between the subjects in the art and the demon itself. The pull got stronger when the artwork found its way back to the subjects. Then, they'd, well…."" He trailed off.

""Meet each other?"" I said.

""In a manner of speaking, yes.""

So many questions bounced around my brain. This all sounded so outlandish and yet…. The memory of the photo came back to me. ""This way, I won't forget you,"" I said out loud.

Confused, Parker looked at me. ""What?""

""We don't know how many paintings Dad did during this time, but we've recovered sixty-five in locations from New York to California. The people selected seemed to be random…except for you.""

""Why me?""

""My guess? You were neighbors and, well, my dad really didn't like your dad.""

""The feeling was mutual.""

Just then, the extraction team came rushing out. One was limping. The machines they brought looked broken, but the lights were still on. One of them had the painting in a bio-containment bag. It was smoking.

""The experienced team,"" David said, ashing out his smoke on the bottom of his shoe and pocketing the butt. ""Thank you for letting us help rid you of this…menace. The work is exhausting, but my family has to atone for Craig's wicked actions.""

David nodded and turned to leave. I reached out and grabbed his shoulder. ""Wait, that's it? We're free? Just like that.""

""Just like that,"" he said, turning to leave. He stopped and spun on his heels. ""Unless you have something from the old house in your new house. Then you kinda sorta leave a backdoor for the demon to return. So, if you do, I suggest destroying it."" He tipped his cap and left.

Parker and I locked eyes. ""The fucking love seat,"" we said at the same time. My back hurt just thinking about hauling it up those narrow stairs.

Later that night, we torched the sofa in a makeshift fire pit in our backyard. We ate pizza and watched the flames consume the potentially demonic couch. Can't imagine that's a sentence that's been said a lot in history. As we did, relief filled my heart. The dread was gone. I looked over at Parker and smiled.

""I think we can put to bed the argument about who had the weirder childhood, Park.""

He laughed. ""Yeah, summers with my Amish family can't compete with demons."" His phone buzzed. He looked down at the notification with concern. I felt my stomach twist.

""Please tell me it's good news.""

""The Rhinos/Habaneros game is about to start. I set a reminder. Wanna watch?""

I touched my heart and felt pure happiness surge through me. Tears. Grabbing his free hand, I held it tight and gave it a big squeeze. ""I have something to confess,"" I said. ""I think I'm a legitimate fan of professional Wiffle ball.""

""I know, babe. I know.""

We sat together, letting the crackling of a burning demon couch and the crack of a Wiffle ball bat fill the night air. I snuggled into Parker's shoulder. It was warm. Inviting. Home…and not one haunted by an angry ghost.

1lxmmip,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lxmmip,"Tried the Ottogi (not Otoki?) Kimchi Ramen, and it's surprisingly empty until you add Dashida","Ottogi is known for many things, but it's definitely not kimchi (imagine if it was jongga (which exists BTW) or bibigo). So I figured what this could be like. 

Well it's a little spicy, a bit spicier than mild really, but the overall flavor around it is extremely mild. Usually I like to not add anything for flavor tests to get the out-of-the-box experience, with one really would have loved a bit of green onion. Or kimchi. 

Honestly the general kimchi flavor is so mild out of the box that I'd say it tastes like the shadow of kimchi, but not the kimchi itself. 

However, it wasn't unredeemable. I grabbed a coffee-spoon worth of Dashida, threw that in, and suddenly I got something soup-worthy. But then again, that's the nature of Dashida... 

Honestly this somewhat makes me want to go for one of those sundubu jjigae / budae jjigae / kimchi jjigae recipes on the internet, they're not much harder to make than this instant, and you get fuller flavor.

I do like the Ottogi instant ramen noodles, but they actually also make instant noodle packets plain, and those are really good (I use those for rabokki). I'd say these noodles were significantly better than yesterday's Nissin Denue noodles. 

But if you want a good kimchi experience, get the Shin Kimchi, that one has full flavor out of the box. I don't entirely remember the Jongga Kimchi Ramen, but I do remember that one came with actual kimchi, not just this 7% kimchi broth powder and barely even flakes.

1lxmg03,https://i.redd.it/3jj7mxwx3ccf1.jpeg,"Reclaiming her crown, one step at a time","She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.
=====
""Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!""
A man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room. 
Noelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.
Her eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss. 
Next to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d. 
Yet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa. 
""You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!"" Gerard snapped. 
Utterly disgusting? 

Noelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. ""I didn't--""

Before she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. ""How dare you talk back!""

The glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments. 

Noelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell. 

Thin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d. 

But Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt. 

This wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her. 

""Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,"" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.

""She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.""

Gerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.

""Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!""

""But Gerard...""

""That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.""

""I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...""

Seeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her. 

Gerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding. 

Did he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks? 

Noelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.

Later on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden. 

After fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.

""What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?""

Noelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly. 

Two years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people. 

Jeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family. 

She even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses. 

For two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down. 

She always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more. 

She truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them. 

But all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault. 

One day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. ""If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.""

If only Noelle had died out there? 

Those words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move. 

Why? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family? 

What made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?

And if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago? 

She closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it. 

That was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake. 

When Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm. 

A strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something. 

He raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, ""If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!""

But before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist. 

It was Noelle. 

She had stopped him. 

""You--"" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.

She'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him? 

Noticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.

""I said I didn't push Willa.""

Gerard looked shocked. ""Still lying? You've got some nerve!""

""Gerard,"" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.

""If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.""

""What did you say?"" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded. 

""You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!""

He refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister. 

On the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.

But when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes. 

Proof? What kind of proof could she have? 

Still, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. ""Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--""

""Stop defending her!"" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. ""I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!""

Noelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device. 

Willa's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.

A voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder? 

Noelle didn't say a word. She pressed play. 

There was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. ""Noelle, what do you think of this spot?""

Gerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice. 

Then came another voice. Calm, light. ""Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?""

Gerald knew that was Noelle's voice. 

The next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.

""Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?""

Chapter 2 Could It Be Him?
Gerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief. 

Willa--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that? 

Willa's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. ""Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!""

But the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning. 

Next came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. ""Willa, are you sure you want to do this?""

Willa's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. ""Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.""

Then, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.

""Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!""

Gerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.

Noelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle. 

Noelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister. 

Gerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. ""Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?""

Noelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better. 

""Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.""

""I..."" He opened his mouth, but no words came. 

It hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa. 

And what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.

Instead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass. 

Shame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa. 

Willa's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling. 

""Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.""

His brow creased. ""What are you talking about?""

Noticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this. 

Her expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause. 

""I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!""

The sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart. 

Now, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all. 

He looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. ""Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.""

Noelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t. 

Her own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up. 

It was absurd. 

She couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick. 

Gerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all. 

""Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!""

Noelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold. 

""You don't have to kick me out,"" she said. ""I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.""

Without another word, she turned and walked toward her room. 

How ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase. 

She packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d. 

There wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them. 

She changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.

When Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family. 

His face twisted with rage. ""Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!""

Noelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. ""I won't regret it.""

Willa stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving! 

With her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers. 

Still, she kept her face carefully controlled.

Bubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, ""Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?""

""Let her go,"" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. ""She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.""

Just then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed. 

He barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter. 

She had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to. 

The bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. ""Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!""

The Martin family? 

Gerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant. 

The Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle. 

Sure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players. 

The Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility. 

For years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it. 

And now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them? 

""Quick, let's go welcome them!"" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way. 

Willa followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed. 

She couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him? 

Chapter 3 Her Future Husband
Gerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle. 

Just as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb. 

When Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs. 

There was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin. 

Ethan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned. 

For Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary. 

A wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect. 

""Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!""

He stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him. 

What was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place. 

Willa stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. ""Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?""

Still nothing. No sound. No movement. 

Gerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused. 

There was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence. 

The tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out. 

Gerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man. 

Gerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous. 

Ruben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family. 

Once he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. ""Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--""

But Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away. 

That moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move. 

Ruben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. ""Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.""

Levi Martin? 

Hearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi. 

Though she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly. 

Levi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl. 

Ruben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her. 

Since the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. ""Thank you.""

""You're very welcome, Miss Moss,"" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands. 

He placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. ""Miss Moss, please.""

Noelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside. 

A man. 

He sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed. 

In his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one. 

At the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her. 

Noelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed. 

""I'm Ethan Martin,"" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. ""I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.""

Ethan Martin? 

The name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind. 

Jeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan. 

And now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband? 

She slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence. 

Gerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief. 

They'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car? 

The whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible? 

Willa's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way. 

But this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public. 

Meanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her. 

But all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement. 

God, she hoped he didn't. 

The whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous. 

But Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying. 

He looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. ""I remember.""

Noelle's heart skipped. 

Of all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most. 

To put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated. 

Even though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life. 

Jeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family. 

Naturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths. 

As kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday. 

Back then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.

But as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse. 

Ethan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door. 

His words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin. 

Their arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other. 

By high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class. 

When Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind. 

She'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night. 

After that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since. 

She hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car. 

He'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone. 

Chapter 4 Get Married Today
The cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road. 

Noelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.

Instead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark. 

Noticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. ""A little wild kitten gave me that.""

Noelle blinked speechlessly. 

Ethan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. ""Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.""

Once again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue? 

That scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.

In a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard. 

She hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark. 

Why hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it? 

Feeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery. 

Ethan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin. 

The air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it. 

But the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say. 

Ethan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. ""What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?""

Noey. 

The nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip. 

She couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids. 

Wait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again? 

Before she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties. 

The tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds. 

Looking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers. 

Farther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape. 

The whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa. 

They stopped in front of a grand fountain. 

There, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man. 

His silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit. 

Even after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi. 

The moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. ""Levi, I've missed you so much!""

""Noelle! My sweet girl!"" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. ""I've waited so long for this moment.""

""How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?"" she asked.

""Don't you go worrying about me now."" He looked at her affectionately. ""This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.""

Noelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning. 

She had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on. 

But it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive. 

Levi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter. 

He passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. ""Come on, let's head inside and talk.""

Inside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas. 

A maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee. 

Levi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.

""My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.""

His words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. ""Levi...""

""There, there."" He gave her hand a gentle pat. ""You've had a tough time these past two years.""

Then, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan. 

""You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.""

Of course she remembered. 

Noelle nodded politely, offering a small smile. 

Ethan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease. 

His face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.

Without a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant. 

Levi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, ""So, what do you think of Ethan?""

The question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over. 

And from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual. 

Still, Levi wouldn't let it go. ""Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?""

Noelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, ""He's... fine.""

Ethan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly. 

Then, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again. 

Levi's face, however, lit up. ""Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.""

Noelle stared at him, puzzled. ""Levi... what do you mean?""

Laughing warmly, Levi said, ""Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?""

Her jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, ""Levi, that's way too sudden!""

Levi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older. 

""Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.""

Noelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him. 

She instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down. 

Surely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree. 

But then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm. 

""All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.""

Noelle stared at him, stunned.

I was very lucky to have a great uncle who shared two cabins with our whole family to use for vacation in Maine and New Hampshire. Growing up, almost everyone went to New Hampshire every year - the camp was very simple but it was on a lake in a fairly bustling tourist town and everyone loved spending time up there. We spent less time in Maine because it was a 7+ hour drive there and because a couple of my siblings found it boring (it's at least 45 minutes to the closest town). 

I always loved going up to Maine. The cabin is set at the back on a blueberry farm that is collectively owned by my great-great-grandfather's family descendants. I loved visiting the old farmhouse with its wood-fire stove, using the antique cooking tools to make pies, and sitting for hours in the blueberry fields. I loved reading historical fiction and this farm was the most amazingly fun backdrop for my imagination.  

As we got older, our trips to Maine became less frequent. Everyone loved New Hampshire and if there was only a couple of days that everyone could make work with their schedules, that was the easier and more popular option. Once I was old enough to start travelling by myself with my boyfriend, I started going up to the Maine cabin a couple times per season. 

My uncle was delighted that we were interested in the camp. According to him, it was used only once or twice a season and he'd considered selling it more than once to avoid the hassle of opening and closing it each year. 

Every time we went up, my boyfriend (now husband) and I would do a few projects to clean up and maintain the property. We started small- deep cleaning and fixing the antique refrigerator and GE push-button(!) stove and slowly started doing more and more to make the space livable. We waged war on the mice and bugs by consistently deep cleaning every time we visited (the initial cleans were horrifying - mouse carcasses and droppings found in kitchen cabinets, drawers, in and under furniture). We were pretty poor in our twenties but were able to make some great improvements by thrifting and strategically buying things for the camp. We got rid of the mouse-infested couch and replaced it with a nice futon. We bought a camp mattress and got rid of the musty, smoky one. We installed flooring in the bathroom, which had previously been just subfloor. We learned home improvement as we went- I'm majorly impressed with myself for learning how to reseat a toilet and install a new kitchen faucet and sprayer. We built a railing for my uncle to use to get himself up the rock steps to the front door when his strength started failing. 

My uncle was so happy with all of the improvements. After seeing that I'd bought containers and organized all of the tools in his workroom he said 'it looks like a hardware store in here!' One of my favorite things we have hanging on the fridge up there is a note from him saying 'Kids- it looks great in here. Keep it up!' After a few years, he asked us to take over opening and closing and managing the 'reservations' for any family who asked to use the camp.  

Of course, I was happily sharing our adventures with my family throughout. I kept encouraging them all to come up to visit and see how much progress we'd made and have a blast with us doing all of the new activities we'd discovered over the years. I had a ton of fun thinking through the logistics of how to comfortably house 5-6 people in a one bedroom cabin for a week (the answer is tents). We bought a firepit and made sure that we stocked the cabin with every supply we could think of to cover everyone's needs and to keep folks from having to drive an hour into town for necessities.  My in-laws started coming up to spend a week and loved the place just as much as we did. They always came prepared to do projects too, despite our insistence that this should be a vacation for them. 

When my family came up, there was some slight praise from my parents  ('it looks better than I feared it was going to look') but that quickly turned into suggestions of what changes should be made. Oftentimes those suggestions would be undoing things we'd carefully thought out and changed on purpose (ex: complaining about there being Keurig instead of a coffee pot. We got rid of the coffee pot because it looked/smelled like no one had ever cleaned it and no one ever trusted the grounds in the cabinet so kept buying and leaving half-empty bags over the years, until we threw them out and starting using the pods instead). They'd be gung-ho about doing large projects and wanting to start them rightnow. My anxiety and cautioning them that \*\*any\*\* project up there took serious planning ahead to make sure you had the proper materials, tools, and timeframe was described as me being controlling. My mom started repeating 'you don't own this place, you know' and 'other people can make decisions - it's not yours.' 

I knew where this was going and really hoped I was wrong. I created lists of projects of various sizes that we could tackle together as a group or as individuals and showed it to my parents. I highlighted some of the things that we'd recognized needed to be prioritized - for example: two of the windows need to be replaced, since we recently had to glue some loose panes back to the deteriorating glazing with clear silicone. I was told not to show anyone else those lists because people might think I thought I owned the place and would get offended. 

When Unc passed, he left everything he had, including his camps, to his nieces and nephews in a trust. They decided to sell the NH camp due to the property value skyrocketing. Since the value of the Maine camp was nominal and most of them had no interest in the property, my parents, and two other nieces bought everyone else out and now own the camp in a three-way split. My family has been mourning the loss of the NH cabin and have since turned their attention to the Maine camp. 

I've been so nervous about the fate of the cabin since Unc died. The settling of the trust took three years. We had no opportunity to say that we wanted to buy in because the sale was restricted to the members of the trust. I don't care that we don't own the cabin personally - it's a family cabin and I don't need to control it but the fact of the matter is that we've been the sole caretakers to the best of our abilities for the past ten years without any support. We've been happy to contribute our time and money to a place we found so special and went out of our way to make it nice enough for our family to want to come stay and use it.   
  
The second my parents bought it, they started ideating with one of the other owners about the changes they'd like to make without including me or my husband in the conversation at all. We know the cabin better than any of them and I do project management for a living. 

I've been getting more and more upset as time goes on because our contributions have been dismissed and patronized as 'a lot of elbow grease' and 'patching.' Of course we'd like to have done more and would have if any of them had offered to contribute financially! I overheard my dad talking about expanding the kitchen and clearing the trees around the camp to let more sunlight in -- what about the leaky windows or the fact that the one bedroom is now leaning up and away from the concrete pilons it's supposed to be sitting on?? 

All I want is for our contributions to be acknowledged and for us to have a 'seat at the table' when plans are being made for major projects. \*\*Especially\*\* since I can see them running into issues and leaving projects unfinished and it becoming our problem to get them finished eventually.  

My mom was talking to my dad about having a planning meeting with the other two owners, making a project list, electing a treasurer, etc. while on the phone with me the other night. When I asked if I was going to be invited to the meeting, my dad said after a long pause 'I guess no one would object to you being there, since you have a known interest in the cabin.' Gee, thanks. Since the main piece of their argument for limiting my involvement seems to be 'you don't own it.' I asked to be able to buy in. I would find the money somehow. Since the three of them own it privately now, I don't see that it should be an issue for us to pay each of them some amount to become a fourth owner. Dad says I'm entitled and overreaching. That 'I'm just going to have to wait my turn for him to die' to take over. That he's not interested in my opinions on the property and is confident that the place 'while certainly cleaner, would still be standing if we never did anything to it at all.' He still expects that we'll manage the opening and closing of the camp each season, though. 

I feel like I've been in an unhealthy state each summer for the past three years. I've wanted to share this special place with my family and make good memories but have come away so hurt by their criticizing and their patronizing attitudes. I hate that they call me controlling for having objections to \*some\* of their suggestions. That I'm dramatic for getting upset. My favorite place is becoming tainted with anxiety. I used to escape there to slow down and feel at peace and now I'm starting to feel this overwhelming sadness every time it's mentioned. I'm so incredibly angry with my parents. This was a perfect opportunity for us to work together on something but they have to be 'in charge' because they're the Owners. They've taken this opportunity to underscore the point that they don't care about my opinions or value my thoughts--especially when they're inconvenient to them. 

I'm thinking of writing my dad a letter to say that if he wants to be in charge so goddamned bad, then he can take over the management of the camp. That we're not contributing a single cent more moving forward because our contributions apparently don't mean shit. It really breaks my heart to think about it but a large part of the joy of fixing up the place has been ruined for me by their attitudes. I'm even struggling to grasp what our relationship is going to look like moving forward. AIO? I don't know how to not be so fucking angry and hurt by this.

I’m a 25-year-old Middle Eastern doctor, currently navigating the beautiful chaos that is life and medicine. I’m relaxed by nature, grounded in faith, and always trying to balance ambition with peace of mind. I’m here in the hopes of meeting someone kind, thoughtful, and genuinely interested in building a meaningful connection, ideally something that could grow into a life partnership.

When I’m not working long shifts or juggling hospital drama (the real kind, not Grey’s Anatomy), I’m usually out for walks, swimming, hiking when I can escape the city, or checking out new cafés and restaurants. I’m also a reader at heart; Murakami is my go-to, and if you’ve read Kafka on the Shore, we’re already off to a great start.

Medicine is something I’m genuinely passionate about. It’s not just a career, it’s a calling, with all the highs and lows that come with it. It’d be amazing to meet someone who either shares that passion or at least understands what it’s like being in this field.

I’m 5’11”, tan skin, black hair, brown eyes, and a light beard. I speak Arabic fluently, and I’d love to connect with someone who speaks another language too. I think being bilingual adds a unique layer to how we see the world and relate to others.

I'm looking to meet someone between 21 and 25. Someone who’s sincere, curious about life, and open to building something real. Bonus points if you’re kind, a little nerdy, or like long conversations over good coffee (or tea I’m flexible 😄).

If this resonated with you at all, I’d really appreciate it if you messaged me with a bit about yourself and maybe a photo too. I’m happy to do the same.

Looking forward to hearing from you ✨

She did tell me she had feelings for me when I was in a relationship and I told her I used to have them for her too but they weren't completely gone. (I got mentally abused and manipulated just all out bad and I left) Now we are in this stage of being more than friends but not dating, we don't text 24/7 but when we do talk or call its for a few hours at least 3. Every time we talk I feel butterflies in my stomach and get a little hyper, my heart races just a little. The one thing that I think that is stopping me from asking her out is because she's going to college. I wouldn't want to take away the opportunity for her to meet someone other than me. If she does its okay, ill be sad yeah but if she's happy that's all that matters.

For reference my ex gf did emotionally abuse her a lot too. she sent 2 death threats and gave her nasty looks at work. I broke up with my ex because of that. she disrespected not only her but my friends and family including her own friends and family.  got back in contact with her for about a month after the breakup. I did take that time to emotionally heal. Some harmful thoughts did cross my mind but with therapy I'm doing much better. She was also going to a lot of stress with college classes and transcripts, and I gave her all the help and advice I could.

Like today we met at 7/11 on accident getting free slurpies. we started talking and then went to publix to pick some stuff up for her and a few of her friends. Then it started to POUR. as we were walking to dollar tree to pick some coffee up we got caught in the rain and I parked my bike at the window but she locked hers at a tree. I offered to go and unlock it and bring it closer and so I did. Now we're sitting in the dollar tree and I wanted to tell her how I felt and wanted to ask her out. Sadly I got nervous a nervousness I've never felt. I brush it off because her dad shows up to pick her up and I load her bike in the backseat and wave goodbye.

I don't know if I should ask her out because she goes to college soon and I'm not sure if she still has feelings for me. On one hand I do on the other hand she has an opportunity to meet other people and have fun. She's not the type of person to go partying or to go drinking. I don't have a clue in the world of what to do.",1,1752278436.0,WhatShouldIDo,4,1.0,False

Picture this: I'm in my Italian class, and one of my students blurts out, ""How do you say 'can't help doing' in Italian?"" Suddenly, I’m back in the trenches of language teaching. The English expression ""can't help"" is a real head-scratcher for Italian learners. 

**Two expressions to the rescue**

The Italian language has its quirks, and directly translating ""can't help"" isn't one of them. Instead, Italian offers two expressions that do the trick:
- _Non potere non_
- _Non potere fare a meno di_

**Real-life examples**

Imagine you're at a party, and you just can't stop thinking about that delicious cake on the table. You'd say, _""Non posso non mangiare questa torta!""_ It’s like trying to ignore an elephant in the room.

Or, picture yourself on a Monday morning, unable to function without a coffee. You'd say, _""Non posso fare a meno di bere caffè la mattina.""_ Because, let's be honest, coffee is life.

**Engage with me**

Have you ever found yourself in a similar situation where you just **couldn't help** doing something? Share your stories, and let's chat about these tricky expressions. Because, in the end, learning Italian is like a roller coaster—full of ups, downs, and unexpected twists!

Lt. Dougal: “How are you just sitting there then?”

Cpt. Deros: “Sorry, I’ve been marveling at this new deployment scheme. I have never seen the fleet so well utilized. I don’t know if you’ve noticed but communication and coordination have really been improving lately.”

Lt. Dougal: “Yeah, because the space worms have some sort of hive mind.”

Cpt. Deros: “Plus, command transparency has been way up.”

Lt. Dougal: “Are you being serious right now? Command has been taken over.”

Cpt. Deros: “Exactly! Command was infiltrated and taken over by a hive mind of space worms and they sent out a memo. Six months ago, you couldn't get Fleet to confirm or deny if they got a new coffee maker.”

Lt. Dougal: “Sure but aren't we going to be replaced or taken over or something by the space worms.”

Cpt. Deros: “No, we won’t. It says in the memo that they aren’t willing to risk hive nodes in front line positions. I guess that means the worms. Really, that’s why they took us over. We protect the hive, they leave the deployed fleet more or less alone.”

Lt. Dougal: “Right, but we’re protecting space worms.”

Cpt. Deros: “Space worms who apparently believe in meritocracy. They have promised to abolish petty command politics. On that note, remember how, the last time we were on Earth, you hooked up with that college student who turned out to be the admiral’s kid?”

Lt. Dougal: “Uh huh.”

Cpt. Deros: “Well, it looks like Fleet Command finally found the missing paperwork to put through your promotion.”

Lt. Dougal: “What? They’re finally making me a Lieutenant Commander?”

Cpt. Deros: “Eh, not exactly. The space worms are making you a Soldier Division Coordinator but the notice indicates that the pay and benefits map the same as Lieutenant Commander.”

As I came back to the room, on the table where I was sitting, there was a green medication cup that I swear to everything I hold sacred wasn't there two minutes earlier. It was empty and just there, like someone just put it down after taking their pills. 

I was telling this to my coworker and she interrupted me before I could even finish and asked is the cup green? 

I showed her the photo that I took, and she said that the Resident that died there only had medication in the green cup.

Six people in the same family were brutally murdered in their mansion.

That morning marked what people would call the ""Bình Phước Massacre"" (Vụ thảm sát Bình Phước) and the ""Nguyễn Hải Dương Case"" (Vụ án Nguyễn Hải Dương). It would become one of Vietnam's most infamous murder cases in modern history.

# 1. Discovery

The first person to discover the incident was Đoàn Thị Cẩm Loan (then-42 y/o), the family's nanny and housekeeper. She would normally stay overnight, but had gone home the night before due to a personal matter.

Around 7 a.m., as usual, Loan returned to inform the boss about meals for the workers at their wood workshop. Upon passing through the back gate, she found the mansion's back door unusually locked. Going around to the front door, she saw it slightly ajar. As soon as she entered, she was shocked to discover the boss, his wife, and his son lying dead.

>I was so scared that I screamed and heard Na lying in the room crying. I quickly went in to hug her, then I continued running upstairs and saw the bodies of Mr. Mỹ's daughter and niece, so I shouted and called the police.

The body of Mr. Mỹ’s nephew was later found by the front gate when police arrived. Officers noted that Na, still in her nanny’s arms, cried and called for her father.

# 2. Victims

The deceased victims are:

* Lê Văn Mỹ (born in 1967, 47 y/o, nicknamed ""Quốc"", owner of the wood workshop)
* Nguyễn Lê Thị Ánh Nga (born in 1972, 42 y/o, Mỹ's wife)
* Lê Thị Ánh Linh (born in 1993, 22 y/o, daughter of Mỹ and Ánh Nga)
* Lê Quốc Anh (born in 2000, 15 y/o, son of Mỹ and Ánh Nga)
* Dư Ngọc Tố Như (born in 1997, 18 y/o, Ánh Nga's niece)
* Dư Minh Vỹ (born in 2001, 14 y/o, Ánh Nga's nephew)

The only survivor was 18-month-old Lê Thị Gia Linh (nicknamed “Na”), the youngest daughter of Mỹ and Ánh Nga, found unharmed sleeping on her parents' bed.

Tố Như and Vỹ, raised by their aunt Ánh Nga after their parents' divorce over bankruptcy, were so close to her they called her “mom.” Tố Như helped with accounting at the family’s wood workshop and aspired to study accounting at university. She had just returned home after taking her university entrance exams in Ho Chi Minh City, half a day before the massacre.

The family, known as the wealthiest in Chơn Thành District, lived modestly and often helped others.

# 3. Crime scene

The crime took place on a 3,000 m² property owned by Lê Văn Mỹ’s family, located on National Highway 13. It included a mansion (also serving as an office) and two large 1,000 m² wood processing factories, legally operating under the name Quốc Anh Wood Processing Production Company.

The bodies' locations:

* Vỹ was found dead near the front gate, clinging to a decorative tree, likely while trying to escape.
* Ánh Nga was killed in the ground-floor living room.
* Mỹ was killed in the ground-floor bedroom.
* Quốc Anh was killed in the adjacent room of Mỹ's bedroom.
* Tố Như and Ánh Linh were killed in the upstairs bedroom (Ánh Linh’s bedroom).

Except for Vỹ, all victims had their hands tied, eyes blindfolded, and necks nearly severed. All of them were strangled and stabbed in the neck.

Initially, investigators suspected a robbery-murder, as the house showed signs of being ransacked. However, some valuable assets, including luxury cars, remained untouched. The property had surveillance cameras, but they had been taken down for maintenance days earlier. The first estimated that the victims were killed within the timestamp from 3 am to 4:30 am.

# 4. Preperators

Through screening, the investigation agency identified **Nguyễn Hải Dương** (then 24 years old) as the main suspect. He used to work in a different wood workshop and was the ex-lover of Lê Thị Ánh Linh. He was detained at the funeral of the victims on July 9. He is identified as the leader of the massacre.

On July 10, **Vũ Văn Tiến** (then 24 years old, Dương's friend) was arrested when he was hiding at a motel in Ho Chi Minh City for assisting Dương during the massacre.

On August 9, the investigation agency prosecuted and detained **Trần Đình Thoại** (then 27 years old) as the third defendant related to the case, as he was aware of Dương's plan, helped him during preparations, and had the intention of participating in the massacre.

# 5. History

**Nguyễn Hải Dương** was born in An Giang Province. He moved to Hóc Môn Province, Ho Chi Minh City, to enroll in a trade school, but dropped out a year later. He was accepted as a carpenter by one of his relatives. Since October 2013, Dương contacted Lê Thị Ánh Linh through Zalo (a popular mobile phone application in Vietnam) when Linh was studying at a university in Thủ Dầu Một City, Bình Dương Province.

After being introduced to her family and accepted by them, he visited her home in Bình Phước every weekend. Though hesitant at first due to his family's extreme poverty in contrast to her extreme wealth, he eventually brought Linh to meet his mom, who adored her.

Over a year later, in May 2015, her mom, Ánh Nga, forbade the relationship, and they broke up. Dương soon entered a new relationship, but continued to feel he couldn’t live without Linh. He later learnt that Linh had been dating another man. Resentful and blaming her family for the breakup, he calmly planned to kill Linh’s entire family and then take his own life.

**Vũ Văn Tiến** is a friend of Dương. They met while working together at the same woodworking factory.

**Trần Đình Thoại** met Dương about 3 months before the massacre while having coffee with his cousin. They kept in touch and became close friends as Dương was very generous. Dương also confided in Thoại about his business, pooling capital to buy a rubber plantation near the border, and asked him to help him buy “hot goods” for protection, including a stun gun (guns are illegal in Vietnam).

# 6. Preparations

To carry out his plot, Nguyễn Hải Dương purchased various items, including a pellet gun, an electric gun, a switchblade, gloves, zip ties, tape, pepper spray, and a disposable SIM card. Again, guns of any kind are illegal in Vietnam. He stored them in a wooden closet he bought and placed at his aunt **Trần Thị Trinh**’s rental. When Trinh asked about the contents and their purpose, he replied, “I’ll tell you later.”

He exploited his connection to the victims by contacting Dư Minh Vỹ, an avid gamer, as the insider. Dương promised him half the money ""robbed"" from Lê Văn Mỹ to spend on games and gave him 350,000 VND on the night of July 3 to open the gate and report on the family. Vỹ complied, and seeing him open the gate undetected boosted Dương’s confidence in his plan. Trinh accompanied Dương that night, where she helped assemble the SIM card and waited across the road, guarding her motorbike while Dương met Vỹ.

Dương then recruited Trần Đình Thoại, falsely claiming he was owed 700–800 million VND from Mỹ's wood sales and needed to “take it back.” He promised Thoại a cut, and Thoại, being poor, agreed. During the trip to the mansion, Dương revealed his plan to kill the entire family, including Vỹ. Though hesitant, Thoại didn’t object, as Dương was the one driving.

At 2 a.m. on July 5, they traveled from Ho Chi Minh City to Bình Phước with weapons, but Vỹ didn’t respond to Dương's calls and texts, so they returned to Hóc Môn District. Dương planned to try again the next day; Thoại later backed out with the reason of ""visiting a sick grandmother at his hometown"", and gave Dương the knife he had bought for himself, which Dương later used to kill Nguyễn Lê Thị Ánh Nga. Thoại said he handed over the knife to distance himself from the plan.

On July 6, Dương invited Vũ Văn Tiến for coffee and pitched the same robbery story. Though initially hesitant, Tiến agreed due to financial struggles. Tiến only learned about his plans of murdering afterward during the trip; while he objected by word, he was afraid of Dương and actively assisted him.

The motorbike Dương used for the trips to the mansion was borrowed from Trinh, who was unaware of his true intentions.

# 7. The crime

* At around 3:00 am on July 7, Nguyễn Hải Dương and Vũ Văn Tiến rode a motorbike to the mansion and texted Dư Minh Vỹ to open the gate, luring him with promises of money and gifts. Once inside, they immediately restrained and killed him.
* They went upstairs to Ánh Linh’s bedroom, where they tied Ánh Linh and Tố Như to window bars and taped their mouths. Then, they went downstairs, tied up Lê Văn Mỹ and Quốc Anh, and restrained Ánh Nga, demanding that she know where money and valuables were hidden.
* Nga opened the safe, but it was empty. She was tied again. Dương and Tiến searched the house and took over 4 million VND and some U.S. dollars. Afterward, they tied Nga again and led Quốc Anh into another room to interrogate him about the valuables. When he said he didn’t know anything, they killed him.
* During this time, Mỹ managed to break free and ran toward the front door, but Tiến blocked him. Mỹ retreated to his room, where Tiến caught and restrained him again. After killing Quốc Anh, Dương and Tiến returned to Mỹ’s room and killed both parents.
* They went back upstairs to question Linh and Như about valuables, but they remained clueless. Như was killed first. Dương then sat beside her body and spoke with his ex-girlfriend Linh for a while before killing her last, despite her begging. He told her, ***""This happened because of how your family treated me.""***
* As they prepared to leave, they heard baby Na crying. Dương cradled her until she fell asleep and placed her gently back in bed, as he felt guilty for killing her entire family, plus he was fond of her when he was still Ánh Linh's boyfriend.
* To cover up blood stains, they changed into Mỹ’s pants. Before fleeing, they also stole five phones and an iPad.

Authorities later discovered outgoing calls made during the murders from the victims’ phones. Tố Như, while tied upstairs (the murderers went downstairs during this time), managed to call Ánh Nga’s younger brother and said only “Uncle” before the line went dead. When he called back, her phone was off. He then called Nga’s phone; at that moment, Dương was controlling her. When asked, Nga said, “Nothing, just go to sleep,” before Dương hung up.

Nga also told the attackers when she was apprehended, “There are three million VND in my trunk, you guys take the car and get the money. My driver will come at 4 am to get the firewood.” Dương took her phone and called the driver, forcing her to say, “Come at 7 am” to delay his arrival.

After returning to their rented room, Dương and Tiến packed the murder weapons into a backpack, which Tiến kept in his residence. The things they had managed to steal had a total value of above 49 million VND.

# 8. The sentence

After the murders were discovered, the family’s nanny texted Nguyễn Hải Dương to inform him about the family's death. Dương asked if the reason for their deaths was known, but she said no, so he decided to attend the funeral on July 9, where he was arrested. When questioned by police, Dương denied involvement, but admitted to his guilt the following morning. He said that he had gone to a pharmacy and bought 10 sleeping pills, intending to purchase more and use them to take his own life after Linh’s funeral.

On July 10, authorities later found and seized all the evidence at Vũ Văn Tiến’s residence, along with arresting him. The investigation concluded that there was sufficient evidence proving that Dương and Tiến committed the massacre.

It was initially thought that there were no accomplices apart from the Dương and Tiến. However, they managed to track Trần Đình Thoại via Dương's call history, when he hadn't bought the disposable SIM card yet. He was arrested on August 9.

The jury had to be pushed back many times: to find a bigger courtroom as many people attended; another time, Trần Thị Trinh recently gave birth, so she could not participate.

At the first instance trial on December 17, 2015, the People's Court of Bình Phước Province sentenced **Nguyễn Hải Dương** and **Vũ Văn Tiến** to **the death penalty** for their charges: murder, mass murder, murder of children, and robbery. **Trần Đình Thoại** received **16 years in prison** for charges of murder and robbery, as he had intended to participate in the crime, despite not having carried it out. In addition, each of the perpetrators' families would have to pay 480 million VND to the victim's family.

The victims' family sent an appeal, requesting that the jury increase Trần Đình Thoại's sentence to the death penalty and review Trần Thị Trinh’s role in the case. They argued that her support – providing Dương with space to store weapons and lending him her motorbike – suggested it was unlikely she was unaware of his intentions.

Nguyễn Dinh, father of Nguyễn Lê Thị Ánh Nga, expressed his concern regarding Trinh:

>I just want everything to be clear. Only when all those involved in this case pay the price before the law, will my children and grandchildren rest in peace.

Vũ Văn Tiến and Trần Đình Thoại also appealed on their sentences. However, all three appeals were declined, and the sentence remained the same.

# 9. Aftermath for the perpetrators

Vũ Văn Tiến and Trần Đình Thoại showed regret for their crimes, but Nguyễn Hải Dương did not. However, he had delivered an apology to the victims' families for causing them pain.

On the afternoon of April 4, 2016, lawyer Đỗ Hải Bình confirmed that Nguyễn Hải Dương had submitted a request for an early execution of his death sentence to the police on the morning of March 30.

Đỗ Hải Bình said:

>Dương said he was afraid that his parents would suffer because he had to visit the detention center every week, wasting his family's time. Therefore, Dương submitted a request for an early execution of his death sentence so that no one would suffer because of him anymore.

He was executed by lethal injection at 6:20 am, November 17, 2017.

Before the execution, he replied to an interview:

>I am very sorry for what I have done. If time could be turned back, I would not commit such a sinful act. After I die, I wish for my body to be cremated and my ashes to be brought to the temple.

Vũ Văn Tiến was executed by lethal injection in the afternoon of September 20, 2018.

Thoại said the reason why he did not report Dương's plans:

>Dương was very determined. I was afraid that if I reported him to the police, he would take revenge and kill my whole family. I thought that if I did not participate, Dương would have no one to go with him and would give up his plan.

Thoại said he was utterly regretful of not reporting Dương to the police before the crime.

# 10. Aftermath for the perpetrators' families

On the morning of July 11, Nguyễn Hải Dương’s 47-year-old mother, Ms. T., sobbed in shock. Neighbors said she continuously fainted after reading the news and repeatedly cried upon gaining consciousness: “Dương, why did you do that, my child?!” Days earlier, upon hearing that Lê Thị Ánh Linh’s entire family had been murdered, Ms. T. stopped eating and sleeping, weeping day and night: “Who could bear to kill my daughter-in-law and kill her entire family?”

She recalled that just over ten days prior, Linh had called her affectionately, explaining she had been busy with her internship and hoped Ms. T. would come visit soon.

>She talked to me normally, very affectionately. There was no sign of them breaking up.

Vũ Thị Thi, mother of defendant Vũ Văn Tiến, knelt before the victims’ families to apologize and plead for mercy. During the verdict announcement, she prayed continuously, hoping for a miracle. After the death sentence was given, she broke down and had to be carried out by relatives.

Despite her age, she continued to campaign for a reduced sentence for her son, which received 10,000 signatures, and managed to raise 30 million VND to compensate the victims’ families.

Nguyễn Anh Khoa, Tiến's close friend and Thi's adoptive son, said:

>Tiến usually doesn’t talk much nor drink or gamble, but is addicted to playing mobile games. Tiến works hard and is very good at his job. He had just quit his job at the old wood workshop 3 months ago to work for a private company with a higher salary.  
  
When I went to Tiến's room to watch TV, he was upstairs. At about 7 pm, when I had just returned to my rental room, the police came to take Tiến away. I was surprised because my gentle, quiet friend was a suspect in the Bình Phước massacre.

Vũ Thị Thi said:

>Tiến made this wooden chessboard and ashtray for his father back in his spare time. He was afraid that his father would be bored sitting alone on duty (Tiến's father was a security guard), so even though he had to worked hard at the wood workshop, he still worked diligently and meticulously on these presents. Since his ordeal, every night I have to hug the chessboard to sleep.

Regarding the moment Tiến's crime was announced, Vũ Thị Thi said:

>I just stood dead there, there was nothing left to live for. At that moment, I just wanted to die so I wouldn't have to be in that moment. I can't imagine how he wouldn't dare cutting the throat of a chicken, but managed to cut the throats of 6 people. Those crimes deserve the death penalty.  
  
Anyone who is about to do something wrong should think about their family, as they are the ones who will suffer the most.

# 11. Aftermath for the victims' families

Nguyễn Lê Thị Thiên Nga (younger sister of Nguyễn Lê Thị Ánh Nga) shared that when the tragedy struck their family, all relatives fell into despair. Public support, including from authorities, helped ease the pain. However, early media reports worsened things by spreading false information: the alleged bankruptcy of Quốc Anh Wood Company, and rumors that Na was the child of Nguyễn Hải Dương and Ánh Linh.

There were also fabricated stories about haunted howling sounds in the villa, making it impossible to hire a housekeeper for 4 months after. After the tragedy, Thiên Nga managed the wood company's business.

>Quốc Anh Wood Company is currently operating stably. That was the wish of my sister and her husband when they were alive.

The family considered demolishing the villa to avoid painful memories, but eventually decided to preserve it as a tribute, to imagine that the family was still in the house. They remodeled the interior, turning multiple floors into a single worship space, preserving only Ánh Linh’s room.

Nguyễn Lê Thị Tố Nga (mother of Tố Như and Vỹ) said tearfully:

>Until now, I still cannot believe that my 2 children, my sister and her husband, and her 2 children have passed away. The perpetrators are more cruel than animals. I wish it was just a dream.

Shortly after Tố Như’s death, her university entrance exam results came back – over 20 points, enough to study accounting at a university of her dreams. Tố Nga visits the villa every day in memory of her children and their cousins.

Lê Thị Kim Tùng, Ánh Nga’s mother and legal representative for the six victims, agreed with the death sentences for Dương and Tiến but opposed the 16-year sentence for Thoại, who had helped Dương prepare and attempted to carry out the murder plan.

Thiên Nga responded to news about clemency for Tiến:

>The press had written about the mother of defendant Tiến asking for signatures from over 10,000 people asking for him to escape the death penalty. Such is the heart of a mother when seeing the death of her child before her eyes. Such is the compassion of the signers, because they think that Tiến is too young, and was forced by Dương to commit the crime.  
  
But everyone, please put yourself in my family's situation, or put my family in yours, to understand the situation. Begging for Tiến a reduced sentence, thinking that he was forced to do it, or he did it out of fear, or because he did not directly kill... without thinking that Tiến is not a child. Tiến did not use a knife to stab, but he used a rope to strangle... Is it any different from stabbing?  
  
Six lives were taken in a row. If we talk about cruelty, Tiến is more cruel than Dương. Dương has a grudge against the family, but Tiến does not.

Nguyễn Lê Vinh, younger brother of Nguyễn Lê Thị Ánh Nga, stated that the family has agreed for Na (Lê Thị Gia Linh) to receive the full inheritance, with the freedom to decide what to do with it once she comes of age. Na was adopted by one of Ánh Nga's sisters, who hadn't married and had no children, and moved to Ho Chi Minh City. Her aunt is wealthy and adores her greatly, and hopes to make up for her loss somehow.

>Na has been sent to a nursery. She is very innocent and naive and did not know what had happened. Now she is more chubby and she returns to Bình Phước every weekend.

I tell him of he has issues i will happily talk to my foreman and we will fix them. ill get better eyeglasses.  He seems satisfied and things are fine.

The other day he started harassing my company. Us and another contractor are pulling cable in an office space. Were talking 1000s of feet of cable. We have to take up space. They didnt seem to have any notice besides construction is happening next door to expand the office space. Were working as fast as we can.

He comes to me and says i cant walk the cable out like that. Ok, well try our best! Were looping it now and out of nowhere he starts taking pics of me and our supplies! (We are not the only contractors in that hallway). I say ""is there an issue??"" And hes like yes youll hear about it from your foreman. Next thing i know everything gets shut down for only us! Siting broken rules that we were not made aware of! I have to go home early. 

My foreman knows this guys is a creep and also weirldly fetishizy and racist. Even the big boss knows. But they say that ONLY ME will not be allowed back.... they say that hes targeting me its better for me to just not be there..........

Why do i always get the short end of the stick? I worked my ass off on that project. Im so disalusioned with it all and im just tired. I love the work but i feel like all i do is get pushed around when i work just as hard as anyone! Why do i always have to be the one thats sent away for other peoples actions....

What can i possibly tell young girls trying to get into this?

This is my first time writing a Reddit post of any kind, so I'll apologize in advance for any faux-pass I may commit :).

So, to start: I'm a 21F uni student. This year, I joined a sports club and happened to run into a person we'll call L, who studies the same degree as me but is a year above (this year we did share some classes as she failed some courses). I actually met this person some years ago when I first started uni at a party, in which she, very drunk, asked to kiss me, to which I, very drunk, said yes. But it remained there and nothing else happened (I didn't even know her name at the time).

Anyway, so this year (October 2024) I run into L at this sports club and we get to be good friends, but she's always very flirty with me. I flirt back (part of it being that's just part of my character, but I also found her attractive). We made out at a party or two and then started meeting up, both of us alone for coffee and stuff like that. At that point, I realize she may want a relationship and i didn't want one, so we have a talk in which I tell her exactly that. She tells me she doesn't need a relationship and is okay with how things are, so we keep going and we have this weird situationship in which she kind of treats me like I'm her girlfriend and I'm just confused. But I'm VERY non-confrontational and it's also not a bad situation so I just keep going.

But then, things get more serious. She starts planning a future together, like the typical ""I want to live in a cottage with you"" fantasy. She also starts always wanting to have like deep conversations trying to change the way I am. In that sense, I must say I'm extremely independent and have a bit of an avoidant attachment, while she's extremely dependent and has an anxious attachment. Which, of course, is a recipe for disaster as I discovered this year. The conversations range from things like ""I fear like you won't miss me like I'll miss you when we go on break"" to others like ""I'm anxious and need you to reassure me we're okay"". The thing is, I have no problem with doing it once, but I swear this conversations were happening every 2 weeks at some point which was just so dreadful to me and really tired me out about this relationship in general.

Things come to an end when, at a party (this was March 2025) I see she's wearing a pin that says ""I <3 my girlfriend"" and introducing me to people as such which is an avoidant's worst nightmare, specially when she knew I didn't want a relationship (for a bunch of reasons, some of them being I'm extremely independent and have had some bad experiences which made me want to have some time to get to know myself better).   End of March 2025, I tell her we need to talk (first and only serious conversation I initiated) and tell her again that I don't want a relationship. After a long conversation, we agree to try to be friends (just friends, no sexual component to it).

Well, the following week she calls me while I'm heading to work and basically tells me she wants to be my girlfriend. I remember this phrase because it really annoyed me (thinking about me still makes me angry): ""I already know how you are, so we could just go on dates and everything."" And I was like ""you know how I am?? then you'd understand I don't want a relationship"". And then she says ""are you going to pretend you don't want to kiss me?"", which honestly, inmediate ick to which I hung up. She then proceeded to spam call me (not joking, she called me 45 times in a span of 30 minutes that day and I had to turn off my phone). By that point, I was already very over it so I just kept going and was on peace with not even being friends with her, as it seemed she couldn't manage it.

But some days later, I got to class and she was there, which, no problem it's totally her right. The thing is, after class ends, she drops a tote bag in my desk and runs out of class (which wtf), and I got really angry so I chased her and threw the bag in front of her, telling her I didn't want it. Well, I went to the bathroom and, when I came back, THE FUCKING BAG WAS THERE AGAIN. So i see she's going out of our class building and I follow it, giving it to her again and saying something like ""I don't want any of this shit"". The things in the bag were a drawing book we saw once and both really liked and a letter, which I didn't open or read. Anyways, I give the bag to her, and she starts telling me she wants to talk, to which I say we have nothing else to talk about. What follows is a 20 minute conversation in which she's just begging to talk and be friends while I'm just saying I don't want to talk with her, all while two of my best friends are hidden in a bathroom. Some days later, a friend sees she's waiting for me outside of class, so I have to take an alternate exit. This happens two or three times, with her following me to beg me to talk when she sees me.

Eventually, in May 2025 she corners me again after a class and I'm so over it I just listen and she tells me she really wants to try and be friends and she wants to apologize for following me and everything so I just tell her okay, as I didn't want any more drama. It's exam season though, so we don't talk much. She does come give me a hug before an exam one day, which was pretty uncomfortable honestly.

In June 2025 we start talking again (she's always the one who talks to me first. I'm not saying this to look like I'm super attractive, but just to show that I was a little over it at that point) and we meet up to go to the beach, to have coffee, etc. Things are actually pretty good at this point and I was getting my hopes up that we could have a friendship. But one day last week, after playing tennis with some of my friends, she approaches me as I'm getting into my car and she asks me ""Can I kiss you?"" to which I just laugh, get in my car and leave. Honestly, not my best moment but quite funny at the time. She messages me saying we need to talk and I say I don't want to talk about anything with her. Well, she then proceeds to spam-message me and actually sends a big ass note she had written telling me she wanted to have this conversation since we started talking again at the beginning of June, which really irks me, since a big problem in our relationship was that she was always controlling when we talked, which made me feel like I was playing at a disadvantatge. We end up talking about it and I tell her I feel betrayed that she's doing the ""I want to be friends -- wait actually, I want to be your girlriend"" thing AGAIN and she says she was trying not to spook me. To which I think: 1. I'm not a horse and 2. I should have been able to decide wether I wanted to talk to you or not based on the truth. At one point in the conversation she says she'd understand if I didn't want to talk to her again and she'd respect it, to which I respond I need some time and I'd like to be zero contact for some time.

But the following day I wake up and I have like 11 voice memos from her, totalling like 27 minutes, just complaining about how I treated her and stuff. Against the advice of my best friends, I listened to the voice memos which were just like complaints from everything and then some excuses as to why she didn't tell me she wanted a relationship again. Anyways, my response is a 3 minute voice memo telling her I do not agree with her and I'm really disappointed that she didn't even respect my choice of zero contact for more than 12 hours. I don't want to end the memo on a bad note, however, so I sincerely wish that things go well for her and I tell her that, that she's a great person and she'll find someone who can give her what she wants. Then I blocked her and haven't heard from her since.

I'm honestly really in shock about the whole situation but I do feel very naive about falling into her lies once again. I also feel really hurt about someone kind of ""baiting"" me with friendship only because they want a romantic relationship with me, which makes me feel like I'm just not good enough to just be a friend to, there must always be something else. But also, I feel like all this time she was just trying to change the way I am to try to make me into a more dependen person who'd want a relationship.

Anyways, safe to say, this has really worsened my trust and commitment issues and doesn't help my avoidant attachment AT ALL.

Would love any analysis on the situation at large and your opinion honestly, and also an answer to this questions: Was blocking her the right thing to do?? How can I manage this zero contact thing when we'll see each other in september, after summer break ends?? And do I go back to the sports club or do I just avoid it to avoid her (honestly It's an evironment I really love)??",3,1752277759.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1lxm4sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1lxm4sb/long_covid_recommendations/,Long Covid? Recommendations?,"Hi everyone. I got sick a month ago and was really under the weather for a week with continued congestion symptoms for another week and a half after that. Everyone else I know got this same illness going around. Some of my friend said it was Covid because they tested positive for it.

At first I thought I was dealing with bacteria die off after starting methylene blue for a week and increasing the dose but when everyone else got sick I figured it was a coincidence.

I’ve had Covid before and never had any issues with “long covid” but ever since getting sick I’ve just had continued fatigue in a matter in which I’ve never seen before. I’m never someone who has suffered from fatigue, I’m 36 and have always had plenty of enthusiasm and energy. Yet lately I am getting fatigued mid day out of seemingly nowhere and don’t understand why. I am making sure to eat healthy and get plenty of sleep and I started feeling a bit better but it still seems like no matter how much sleep I get it doesn’t seem to carry me through the day the way it would have a month ago.

I thought maybe it’s adrenal fatigue from drinking so much coffee leading up to and during my sickness so I’ve been drinking decaf today but I’ve quit coffee before and never felt this way coming off a coffee binge. 

I’ve even made sure to take high quality d2 and k2, mag l theronate, zinc/copper, and b12 vitamins, and sometimes some small melatonin at night but none of it seems to matter.

One other strange symptom is I believe I am starting to get mild anhedonia as I am feeling generally burnt out and unenthusiastic about things, I am also feeling more irritable and generally more tense the last couple days but maybe that’s caffeine withdrawal?

The only thing I can think at this point is that it must be some variant of long covid or whatever biochemical result of that sort of thing in the body, even if caused by another illness.

I am open to any recommendations. I am going to try and get bloodwork done this week, as I am really starting to suffer here. A week or two of feeling off after illness is one thing but it’s been closer to a month…

There are no food banks open u til at least Tuesday, I've left messages for charities but not in time to get s response and it's the weekend now and I'm starving. Safe but starving. I plan on stretching the $40 for a whole week until I get some assistance.

If anyone is able to help with $40, or any amount,  it would make a huge difference to be able to get some basic foods that are hotel friendly and some dollar store cutlery, to be able to eat.

She did tell me she had feelings for me when I was in a relationship and I told her I used to have them for her too but they weren't completely gone. (I got mentally abused and manipulated just all out bad and I left) Now we are in this stage of being more than friends but not dating, we don't text 24/7 but when we do talk or call its for a few hours at least 3. Every time we talk I feel butterflies in my stomach and get a little hyper, my heart races just a little. The one thing that I think that is stopping me from asking her out is because she's going to college. I wouldn't want to take away the opportunity for her to meet someone other than me. If she does its okay, ill be sad yeah but if she's happy that's all that matters. 

  
also for reference my ex gf did emotionally abuse her a lot too. she sent 2 death threats and gave her nasty looks at school. I broke up with my ex because of that. she disrespected not only her but my friends and family including her own friends and family. Now that me and my crush are graduated (high school) I got back in contact with her for about a month. I did take that time to emotionally heal. Some harmful thoughts did cross my mind but with therapy I'm doing much better. She was also going to a lot of stress with college classes and transcripts, and I gave her all the help and advice I could.

Like today we met at 7/11 on accident getting free slurpies. we started talking and then went to publix to pick some stuff up for her and a few of her friends. Then it started to POUR. as we were walking to dollar tree to pick some coffee up we got caught in the rain and I parked my bike at the window but she locked hers at a tree. I offered to go and unlock it and bring it closer and so I did. Now we're sitting in the dollar tree and I wanted to tell her how I felt and wanted to ask her out. Sadly I got nervous a nervousness I've never felt. I brush it off because her dad shows up to pick her up and I load her bike in the backseat and wave goodbye. 

I don't know if I should ask her out because she goes to college soon and I'm not sure if she still has feelings for me. On one hand I do on the other hand she has an opportunity to meet other people and have fun. She's not the type of person to go partying or to go drinking.

A Letter I won't send

Dear J
  
Now that enough time has passed, I want to tell you what I’ve learned and reflected upon in the months since. 

Your love never left me. I felt your absence every single day. I felt it in every morning, in every coffee, in every social interaction, and in every breath. Despite the difficulty, I continued living my life without you. I committed to sobriety and going to therapy. I often had a lingering sense of regret that I wasn’t able to commit to this for the benefit our relationship while we still had it. 

The love we had was beautiful, special, and raw, and it changed my life. It was ours, and it will continue to be even if time passes and our feelings towards each other and the relationship change. I also know that our love could be difficult and painful. I now believe that whenever we argued, both of us just wanted to be seen and acknowledged, but we were two different souls learning how to love and understand each other. 

Somehow, somewhere along the way, when one of us expressed how we felt and the other tried to understand, the message got lost in translation. For me, when I listened, I could only hear how inadequate I was and how I had to change. I always saw it as an argument and responded accordingly, instead of seeing it as an invitation to show me how my actions hurt you. I won’t justify my actions by blaming the insecurities from my past, the way you brought up these issues, or the emotions I had. I wasn’t the person you needed me to be, and I’m sorry. I could have changed, listened, and acknowledged you, but I didn’t. 

I also want to apologize for how I treated you during the relationship, despite the hell I endured following your departure. I wasn’t honest with you or with myself, I took you for granted just as much as you took me for granted, and I put my comfort, my happiness, and my fears before your needs, vice versa. I continued to do this even after we broke up by not respecting your boundary of no contact even though you left me during a period in my life you played a direct hand in igniting; I was the fuse, you were the match. It was a difficult transition, and I’m sorry for the ways I tried to beg, bargain, guilt, or pressure you back into my life. Still hurts you never did the same.

In those moments, I didn’t understand why you left and how you could leave me with so little to hold onto. But I know that breakups are hard– it was both of our first real relationships and one of many firsts we held together. Although I held onto anger at the ways you ended the relationship, I’ve realized that you were doing what you felt was best for you and our relationship. 

In my healing journey, one of the most important lessons I learned was letting go of the illusion of control. I can’t rewrite the past or undo my mistakes. I can’t take back the ways I hurt you, even though I now understand why I did. And I can’t change how I behaved after we broke up. Every day, I have to live with the consequences of my actions. I can only acknowledge, forgive, and learn from these experiences. 

Similarly, I can’t change the way you acted. I can’t change the reality that you broke up with me or the way you did it. In the moment, and for months after, I wanted to keep trying and fix our mistakes, but you didn’t. All I can do is acknowledge the reality of our love– from the unexpected beginning to the painful end, for all of its beauty to all of its perfect imperfections. 

The final aspect I cannot control is the ending of our story. It might have already happened. We might walk our separate paths and slowly return to becoming strangers to each other– only this time, with a shared history of love. We might return to speaking terms once we’ve healed and be friendly with each other, though never once letting our defenses down again. We might try again and fail. We might grow old together and share our lives again.

I don’t know what will happen. This uncertainty is difficult to come to terms with, but it will teach me how to live in the moment. I have to learn to accept any outcome, no matter how painful or how much I want it to happen. While I can't write this to you, I'll write to the memory i have of you; the J i used to know. 

Thank you for everything. I love you. 

Leaving the apartment felt like: 
As messy as this room may look, I wish it still looked the same. I wish it was messier, I wish the pile on the floor was immovable, and the mirror was too heavy for 10 people to lift. I should have opted for the portraits on the walls to be cemented rather than nailed. I wish the vanity i always hated still needed to have the drawers pulled all the way out to realign them everyday. I wish it was just as bright there now. I wish I was still just as goofy and truly smile like that again one day. I wish the things you can't see were still there despite me wishing they never were. I wish i was still 15lbs heavier, maybe then it would be harder to push me aside. I can wish a million times but a wish, by definition, is just a desire that is not easily attainable; something that cannot or probably will not happen. I wish i didn't feel as overused as a word that's been coined dozens of times to describe the paradox of the world i've been living in. Nobody's given the guidelines on how to live life properly; we learn to walk by falling... what a contradiction. Perhaps the only rule that's for certain is there are no rules. You create the guidelines to your life just as much as you run headfirst into guideposts. I am truly remarkable and I am one of a kind - how lucky am I to feel so deeply through the small overlooked sentiments of this home. However, I keep in mind the major difference between who I am compared to these tender memories - they are replaceable.

1lxlz1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CineworldUnlimited/comments/1lxlz1z/superman_4dx_experience_indepth_review_with_imax/,‘Superman’ 4DX experience in-depth review (with IMAX GT and Dolby Cinema comparison),"With the director of the *Guardians of the Galaxy* trilogy jumping ship to head up DC’s new slate of superhero projects, *Superman* heralds a new universe of DC superhero films. But does it also herald a universe of great premium format experiences? This time I’ve tested not only 4DX but also IMAX and Dolby Cinema.

**The film itself - ★★★★☆:** While I’ve not been particularly spoiler-phobic for this film, I’ve been a bit irked by the sheer amount of plot discourse going on before the official release date, so I’ll try to keep this quite plot-light beyond the opening.

The film leaps in three years after Superman started Supermanning. He’s dating Lois Lane but has recently caused controversy intervening in an overseas military affair, providing evil billionaire Lex Luthor with an opening…

I pre-booked all three screenings ahead of the day so you can imagine the *fear* I felt when a few two-star reviews started rolling in. Fortunately, I did heartily enjoy this.

I thought David Corenswet was great as Superman, which is fortunate what with this being a Superman film and all. He really sells the Boy Scout aspect of the character, as well as his goofy, humorous aspects and is an excellent fit for the role. The rest of the cast puts in decent performances, with Edi Gathegi particularly standing out as relatively obscure comic character Mr Terrific.

The purported main inspiration for the film is the limited comic series *All Star Superman*. While the film does riff off the general vibe of this comic, it doesn’t adapt any particular plot beats from it. *All Star Superman*, while providing a minimalist one-page recap of Superman’s origin story, jumps right in with an already active Superman and takes on a broad survey of Superman mythology, expecting the audience to roll with a variety of Superman references, some of which, in the manner of a *Family Guy* cutaway gag, they might not fully understand. While I’d say *Superman* is a bit more accessible, it has a similar maximalist approach. I can understand why this has jibed with some people - it’s not traditional minimalist cinema storytelling but for me it was enjoyable in its own right. It is a style of storytelling that feels like it’s putting the ‘comic book’ in comic book movie. It is actually worth giving *All Star Superman* a look if you’re not planning on immediately seeing the film - it’s a highly acclaimed comic and will help set your expectations for the film. The DC Compact Comics edition is only £8.99 RRP and is a manga-style paperback that fits in a bag.

The film offers social commentary on a number of different contemporary themes which, if anything, have become more relevant since the film was written and which consequently work well. There’s also a lot of good humorous moments in the film, which decent laughs from the audience across the screenings.

It does strike me that there’s very little going on character-wise outside of Superman’s core arc, which isn’t a disaster since it is, y’know, *Superman*, but you would think that Lois in particular as the deuteragonist might have had her own standalone character progression not entirely hinged around her relationship with the protagonist.

Random extremely minor nitpicks from seeing the film three times in one day:
• There’s a fast pan in one of the early scenes that looks juddery and probably should have been slower.
• There’s a close-up shot of Superman/Clark putting some bread in a toaster but then we never see the toaster pop or Clark and Lois eating toast and I was just like “What happened to the toast, James Gunn? Where is the toast?!?” I thought about the toast throughout the entire second screening of the film.
• There’s a brief shot of a minor character ripping a badge off their collar at one point but the badge is never clearly visible at any point during the film so it has no impact at all.

Overall, this is a fun movie with a decent amount of social commentary, albeit with somewhat limited characterisation. It seems like a good start for James Gunn’s new DC universe - my interest is piqued for future films despite not following the previous universe and I’d even happily watch a Mr Terrific movie at this point, not a bad outcome for an apparently obscure character. I wouldn’t put it up there with *The Dark Knight* or anything but it’s one of the better shared universe-era superhero films.

**For IMAX, I attended bright and early for the 8:00 screening at the full-fat IMAX GT at Manchester Printworks.**

**The IMAX experience - ★★★★★:** In IMAX, Superman is presented in 1:90 throughout, with a small amount of exclusive footage compared to the regular release of 1:85. I’ve said this before, but I think consistent 1:90 is a perfectly fine aspect ratio for IMAX - it might not be using the full screen but you don’t get distracting aspect ratio changes and the image doesn’t extend into the audience’s heads (even in this I had to avoid fully reclining the seat due to a tall person in the next row). As usual, the screen is massive and consequently every bit of detail is on clear display. IMAX is a fairly straightforward format and there’s nothing to poke holes in here so full marks.

**After the IMAX screening, I hoped on a tram to the Trafford Centre to almost immediately watch the film again at the 12:00 Dolby Cinema screening.**

**The Dolby Cinema experience - ★★★★★:** In Dolby Cinema, the film is shown in its standard aspect ratio but with improved black levels, brightness and colour depth. I did think this format was much more flattering towards the colour grade - in IMAX the colour grade looks a bit unnatural and desaturated but with this format, colours deprioritised by the grade seemed a bit more prominent making things like fresh toned look a bit more natural and less obviously colour graded. The bright blues and particularly reds of Superman-related outfits etc. also popped a bit more with this.

The Dolby lacks a l’il bit of aspect ratio that’s exclusive to IMAX but I didn’t particularly miss it and actually my Dolby screen already had vertical bars on the sides so adding more aspect ratio would have just shrunk the area where the main action was blocked.

There was only one brief instance where the Dolby Atmos audio made the direction of a sound noticeably clearer. I have to say in general that I preferred the IMAX audio.

This was my first time with Dolby Cinema and I thought the recliners were much better than the IMAX ones, not just because they’re electric but also because they have a lot more lumbar support - the IMAX ones are a bit hollow in the lumbar area and I tend to take a cushion for longer films. I did think it was weird the moveable trays actually stop you using one of the armrests as an armrest and I
would have preferred a fixed, raised tray affixed between the seats.

Again, a pretty straightforward format and nothing major to poke holes in here, so full marks.

**After an arduous journey home in the heatwave sun, I had a break and a restorative coffee and shower and then set out for the final evening screening at my local 4DX cinema.**

**The 4DX experience - ★★★★★:** Had a bit of a dilemma with this one but ultimately decided it just barely scrapes a top grade (the first of 2025).

The film is generally a good fit for 4DX - there’s a really good helping of mid-film action scenes in this, one of which could have happily been the climax of a lesser film, so there’s some really good opportunities for heavy effects usage throughout the film. On the other hand, despite the 4DX screening being my third time watching the film in one day, it was surprising how much of the runtime was dedicated to talky scenes that didn’t require effects. But ultimately there’s a limit to how much you can penalise a film for, y’know, having characters and plot.

This film gave the seat effects a really good workout - you really do take every blow along with Superman with the seats violently throwing you around along with the action. There are also some standout moments where the movements manage to have the opportunity to really synergise with the on-screen action in a really movie-specific way. I know a few people were looking forward to the flying sequences in this and they are indeed enjoyable.

In terms of weather, wind is used during flying sequences and the rain is used as a kind of general water spray in one sequence. I think snow might have come up once but it’s very difficult to even see in 3D screenings. There’s a surprising amount of strobe in this, representing certain technologies and superpowers. Unusually, I don’t think the fog is used much, if at all, in this - maybe because a wind representing Superman’s movement would immediately blow it away?

Scent is used infrequently - a burning scent is used near the start of the film in an enemy attack and I think maybe one other time although I wasn’t sure what it was supposed to represent. Airflow pops up a bit representing gunfire and superpowers, and direct water spray is also used in a few sequences that call for it. Like many recent films, I can think of one sequence where the on-screen footage would have supported a more maximalist use of water effects but it wasn’t taken up.

Overall, it’s the best 4DX effects package of the year and put a big grin on my face multiple times during the film. While it can’t match *Twisters* for pure quantity, it does feature excellent effects usage.

I would have happily also checked this out on ScreenX if I could have fit it in but, alas, my local ScreenX is keeping in *Jurassic World Rebirth* and I couldn’t fit in the four-hour round trip to the nearest place actually showing it - maybe share in the comments how you got on if you managed to see it in this format.

**Conclusion:** I thought Dolby was a pretty decent format and the recliners were a lot more comfortable than the IMAX ones, which made a surprisingly big difference to the overall experience. I do think it’s a lot less of a unique experience than IMAX and it strikes me that if you have a decent OLED-based home cinema, you’re doing to get even better brightness, black levels and colour watching the 4K Blu-ray with only some compromise to the field of view and sound, whereas you can’t meaningfully replicate IMAX at home. So while the Dolby’s a solid choice if you don’t have access to IMAX, I’d recommend IMAX out of the two.

Comparing IMAX to 4DX, the former is the clear winner for a purist cinema experience but the 4DX is also really fun and additive in a completely different way. If you really enjoyed the film in IMAX and fancied seeing it again, the 4DX is worth checking out for a different experience. Likewise if you don’t have access to IMAX, the 4DX is worth a look if you fancy a special treat for this film.

The film was a really good experience in all the premium formats I tried - it’s arguably the premium format event of the year so far and whichever format you choose or have available (with the possible exception of ScreenX), you’ll have a really good experience.

I can't read her.,"I met the person that I want to spend the rest of my life with at work. I have been working as a hotel receptionist for almost a year now, all the while she was working right next to me as a barista/reception agent trainee. As we both worked the morning shift for months on end, we spent a lot of time together and got to know each other better over time. During our shifts together, I have developed a deep affection for her as a person but I was too shy to express it. We have a similar way of thinking, somewhat same hobbies and I think our personality compatibility is great. I don't believe in zodiacs but I'll just point out that we are both Gemini. 

  
Two months ago, I mustered the courage to ask her on a date, passing it as a way of relaxing after a tiresome shift. We sat at a coffee shop and talked for hours on end, personal matters and whatnot, where she seemingly enjoyed my company and had a great time with me. At the end of the date, I dropped the bomb and told her about how I really feel, what I love about her as a person and how she makes me a better person. Ultimately I got rejected, and the main reason was that she does not want to mix work with personal, which is a totally valid reason. She said that I am a wonderful person and if the circumstances were different maybe she would consider going out with me. To tell you the truth though, I do feel like my appearance at the time was a key factor as well.

  
At this point I should let you know that at the time, I used to be severely overweight (140 kg) and have had no experience with love in my life. She met me as a much fatter person, but because lately I was making an effort, she understood that I was trying to lose weight for an important reason, not knowing that the reason was her all along. 

  
Fast forwarding to today, almost 2 months later, I am now weighing 115 kg after fixing my diet/exercising more and I feel much more confident as a person. Our shifts are no longer together as she became my colleague at the reception desk after her training ended, but whenever we meet for the shift change, she is acting a bit flirty and makes snappy comments like ""somebody has stolen your mind/heart"" or ""I would really like to meet that person"" etc. 

  
We have also gone a few dates outside of work as well, we went to the theater, for cocktails, and today we went for a late night walk after she got off work. 

The thing is, over texts since my confession, I asked her if I can be a bit bold since she already knows my feelings (where she said she absolutely does not mind) and I always compliment her whenever I get the chance. She also sends a lot of heart emojis, like a lot, and she occasionally sends me greetings like ""good morning \*heart"" emoji x3"" etc.

One message that really left an impression to me, said: ""I can't believe you exist and I thank god for meeting you. I hope this whole thing evolves into something beautiful"". 

You would think that after a statement like that, she would be into me, but I am not really sure and I definitely don't want to risk making things awkward between us.

  
Now, the issue at hand is that she is giving me positive signs and she accepts whenever I ask her out but I do not want to attempt to hug her or hold her hand and make her uncomfortable, because she told me that she does not want to mix professional with personal. I just can't understand if she wants me to make a move on her or she simply want me for emotional support. 

  
What's your opinion on my situation? Am I going the right way? Tell her again how I feel and that I want to be in a relationship with her now that I am in a better physique and more confident? She already knows that I am planning to leave work in 5 months so waiting for that is also an option, but in this case I fear of losing her affection or the timing won't be right.

I try not to think of you.
But sometimes, when I see a cup of dark roast coffee,
It reminds me of something I got so used to —
Those deep, brown eyes I once gazed into longingly.
But instead of seeing in them myself,
I wonder if your new girl,
Does she see herself
In those deep brown eyes?

I wonder — do you look at her like you looked at me,
Like she shines like the moon on a dark, still night?
I wonder, does she smile the way I did with you,
A smile so bright
You'd forget why you ever even felt blue 

Will she believe your lies too?
The ones you told me — will you tell her the same?
She's the first girl you ever bought flowers for?
That she is one in a crore - like you once said to me 
That she feels like home. 

But see you never had a single home
India, Switzerland, England 
One place to another 
Will she also play along to your stupid little game 

And when the stars come out, will you hold her,
Deep in your arms like you once held me,
And tell her there truly is no other?

I try not to think of you.
So maybe — just one morning,
When I see the colour of that coffee,
Maybe I won’t think of you.
And I’ll just sip it quietly.
Without looking for you in the cup

1lxlwfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1lxlwfi/gastritis_and_anxiety_why_stomach_symptoms/,Gastritis and Anxiety: Why Stomach Symptoms Trigger Health Anxiety- (Chat GPT Deep search),"The hallmark symptoms of gastritis – such as stomach pain, burning in the upper abdomen, persistent bloating, and nausea – are distressing and can mimic those of more serious diseases. People with health anxiety often **catastrophize** these bodily sensations, immediately assuming the worst. For example, a bout of gastritis pain might be misinterpreted as a sign of a bleeding ulcer or even stomach cancer. In cognitive-behavioral models of health anxiety, such *catastrophic misinterpretations of bodily symptoms* are central [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26093824/#:~:text=Catastrophic%20misinterpretations%20of%20bodily%20symptoms,metacognition%2C%20catastrophic%20misinterpretation%2C%20and%20health). The anxious brain, primed to detect threats, can amplify benign sensations into perceived evidence of severe illness. A noisy or upset stomach that most people would attribute to something minor (“something I ate” or routine indigestion) might be seen by an anxious individual as a life-threatening problem. Health anxiety sufferers become easily alarmed by normal bodily feelings, and reassurance from doctors often provides little relief [mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/illness-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20373782#:~:text=Symptoms)[mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/illness-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20373782#:~:text=,it%27s%20hard%20for%20you%20to). Instead, they remain hyper-vigilant, monitoring every gurgle or twinge in their abdomen as a potential sign of disaster. Over time, this constant worry creates a feedback loop: the more one worries about the stomach, the more one *notices* and magnifies its sensations. In essence, gastritis symptoms can act as a trigger that activates an individual’s pre-existing health fears and illness beliefs. When the brain expects danger, it interprets any pain or discomfort as proof that something is gravely wrong, leading to intense anxiety.

It is common, for instance, for someone with gastritis-related pain to fear they have an ulcer perforation or an undetected tumor. Bloating or a feeling of fullness might be misconstrued as a “mass” in the stomach. Acid reflux or burning can be misread as a heart problem or esophageal damage. These misinterpretations are reinforced by the *physical overlap* between gastritis symptoms and other conditions – for example, gastritis pain in the upper abdomen can resemble the pain of peptic ulcers or even referred pain from cardiac issues. The brain’s alarm system doesn’t easily discern that “this pain is coming from a relatively benign inflammation.” Instead, it often defaults to *worst-case scenario* thinking, especially in anxious individuals [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26093824/#:~:text=Catastrophic%20misinterpretations%20of%20bodily%20symptoms,metacognition%2C%20catastrophic%20misinterpretation%2C%20and%20health). This explains why gastritis so often triggers **health anxiety**: the symptoms are tangible and uncomfortable, yet internally located and somewhat ambiguous – a perfect storm for an anxious mind that craves certainty about health.

# Prevalence of Anxiety in Gastritis Patients

Medical research has increasingly documented that people with gastritis commonly experience higher levels of anxiety and mood disturbances than the general population. One large population-based study found that adults with a **diagnosis of gastritis** had significantly higher rates of anxiety disorders (about 27% of gastritis sufferers) compared to those without gastritis (15% anxiety rate )[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23073472/#:~:text=relationships,increased%20odds%20of%20mood%20and). In the same study, mood disorders like depression were also more prevalent in the gastritis group, suggesting a strong association between stomach inflammation and mental health [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23073472/#:~:text=relationships,increased%20odds%20of%20mood%20and). Another review noted that gastritis is often accompanied by panic attacks and social phobia at greater rates than expected [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23073472/#:~:text=Survey.%20Anxiety%20disorders%20%2827.0,Contrary%20to%20findings) – for example, sudden bouts of intense fear (panic) can be precipitated by the discomfort and uncertainty of gastric pain.

Recent data continue to support this connection. A 2023 cross-sectional study reported that roughly **36.4% of patients with chronic gastritis** exhibited clinically significant anxiety symptoms [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=evidence%20indicating%20that%20anxiety%20symptoms%2C,have%20always%20been%20a%20thorny). This is more than one-third of chronic gastritis patients – a striking figure that highlights how common anxiety is in this group. For comparison, anxiety prevalence in the general adult population is usually estimated in the range of 10–20%, so the rate among gastritis sufferers is markedly elevated. The same study found similar high anxiety rates in other gastrointestinal conditions (for instance, about 32% in peptic ulcer disease) and emphasized that having more severe or persistent GI symptoms corresponds to higher anxiety levels [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=evidence%20indicating%20that%20anxiety%20symptoms%2C,have%20always%20been%20a%20thorny)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=instance%2C%20the%20prevalence%20of%20anxiety,10%20%2C%2035). In other words, the more intense or chronic the gastritis symptoms, the more likely the person is to experience significant anxiety.

There are several reasons why gastritis patients have higher anxiety. Living with chronic digestive symptoms can degrade quality of life – frequent pain, dietary restrictions, and repeated medical visits create a constant stressor [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=instance%2C%20the%20prevalence%20of%20anxiety,have%20always%20been%20a%20thorny). Patients often need ongoing medication (like acid reducers) and may undergo invasive tests (endoscopies, biopsies) to manage gastritis. This continual focus on one’s health can itself breed worry. Moreover, uncertainty about the cause of symptoms (Is it H. pylori infection? Is it autoimmune? Something worse?) can keep patients in a state of vigilance. Research indicates that patients’ own **perceptions of their illness** play a mediating role: those who believe their gastritis is severe, chronic, or uncontrollable are more likely to feel anxious [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=guided%20subsequent%20medical,as%20far%20as%20we%20know)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=negative%20illness%20perception%20were%20more,has%20not%20been%20reported%20previously). For example, if a patient interprets recurring stomach pain as a sign that “my digestive system is permanently damaged” or “nothing will cure this,” their anxiety spikes. This concept, known as *negative illness perception*, has been linked to greater anxiety in chronic GI diseases [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=guided%20subsequent%20medical,as%20far%20as%20we%20know). In summary, it’s not just the physical pain of gastritis contributing to anxiety; it’s also the emotional burden, the uncertainty, and often the fear of serious underlying illness that come along for the ride.

# How Anxiety and Stress Aggravate Gastritis

Just as gastritis can induce anxiety, the reverse is also true: anxiety and psychological stress can physically aggravate the stomach. The **brain and gut are connected by a bi-directional communication network** often termed the gut-brain axis [health.harvard.edu](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection#:~:text=The%20brain%20has%20a%20direct,system%20are%20intimately%20connected). When we experience stress or anxiety, the brain sends signals that can alter gastrointestinal function in multiple ways. One immediate effect of acute anxiety is the “fight or flight” response, which triggers a surge of stress hormones (like adrenaline and cortisol). These hormones have a direct impact on the digestive system. For instance, **high anxiety causes increased secretion of gastric acid** and a reduction in the protective mucus layer of the stomach [unicamillus.org](https://unicamillus.org/en/news/stress-induced-gastritis-when-stress-affects-the-stomach/#:~:text=coffee%2C%20painkillers%2C%20and%20stomach%20infections,lecturer%20in%20Gastroenterology%20at%20UniCamillus)[unicamillus.org](https://unicamillus.org/en/news/stress-induced-gastritis-when-stress-affects-the-stomach/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CStress,%E2%80%9D). This hormonal state creates a harsher environment in the stomach: excess acid can irritate or inflame the stomach lining, and with less mucus to shield the tissue, acid does more damage. The result is often the onset or worsening of gastritis symptoms during times of intense stress. Professor Giovanni Leonetti, a gastroenterology expert, explains that *“stress can also cause gastritis because anxiety creates a hormonal state in the body that increases the secretion of gastric juices, causing stomach pain, bloating, acidity and burning”* [unicamillus.org](https://unicamillus.org/en/news/stress-induced-gastritis-when-stress-affects-the-stomach/#:~:text=coffee%2C%20painkillers%2C%20and%20stomach%20infections,lecturer%20in%20Gastroenterology%20at%20UniCamillus). In essence, the anxious brain literally changes the chemistry of the gut.

Chronic stress doesn’t only increase acid. It also alters nerve signals and blood flow to the stomach. Under chronic stress, the **autonomic nervous system** can become imbalanced, often with overactivity of the sympathetic “fight-flight” branch [unicamillus.org](https://unicamillus.org/en/news/stress-induced-gastritis-when-stress-affects-the-stomach/#:~:text=the%20stomach%2C%20the%20small%20intestine%2C,%E2%80%9D). This can lead to heightened sensitivity and dysfunction in the GI tract. Researchers note that prolonged stress can cause *“hypersensitivity of the sympathetic nervous system, which can cause the onset of pathological symptoms at the gastric and intestinal levels”* [unicamillus.org](https://unicamillus.org/en/news/stress-induced-gastritis-when-stress-affects-the-stomach/#:~:text=the%20stomach%2C%20the%20small%20intestine%2C,%E2%80%9D). Practically speaking, this means the stomach and intestines may start reacting strongly to stimuli that normally wouldn’t cause pain. Stress-related gastritis (sometimes even called “stress gastritis”) is a recognized phenomenon – for example, hospital patients under extreme physiological stress (major surgery, critical illness) can develop acute gastritis due to the body’s stress responses, including reduced blood flow to the stomach lining [my.clevelandclinic.org](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10349-gastritis#:~:text=)[my.clevelandclinic.org](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10349-gastritis#:~:text=A%20major%20surgery%2C%20trauma%20or,vulnerable%20to%20the%20chemicals%20inside). Even in everyday stress, though, we see milder versions of this effect: people who worry a lot often report “acid stomach” or heartburn flaring up during anxious periods.

Behavioral factors associated with anxiety can contribute as well. Someone with high anxiety might consume more caffeine or nicotine to cope, or may take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) more frequently for stress headaches – all of which can irritate the stomach lining. Additionally, anxious individuals sometimes hyperventilate or have irregular breathing patterns, which can affect the vagus nerve and abdominal organ function, potentially exacerbating nausea or bloating. Over time, a feedback loop can form: stress worsens gastritis, which causes more pain and discomfort, which then *causes even more stress*, and so on. This is why treating gastritis often requires a dual approach: **physical treatment** (diet changes, acid-suppressing medications, antibiotics if H. pylori infection is present, etc.) and **stress management** (relaxation techniques, therapy, lifestyle changes). As one clinician succinctly put it, “it is necessary to act on two fronts: psychologically, by reducing stress, and physically, by adopting a healthy lifestyle and possibly medication”[unicamillus.org](https://unicamillus.org/en/news/stress-induced-gastritis-when-stress-affects-the-stomach/#:~:text=coffee%2C%20painkillers%2C%20and%20stomach%20infections,lecturer%20in%20Gastroenterology%20at%20UniCamillus)[unicamillus.org](https://unicamillus.org/en/news/stress-induced-gastritis-when-stress-affects-the-stomach/#:~:text=state%20in%20the%20body%20that,We). Calming the mind can directly help calm the stomach.

# Physiological Pathways of the Gut-Brain Axis

Underlying the stress-gastritis connection are well-mapped physiological pathways. The gut-brain axis includes: (1) **Neural pathways** – chiefly the vagus nerve and other nerves that send signals between the gut and central nervous system; (2) **Endocrine (hormonal) pathways** – such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases cortisol and other stress hormones affecting gut function; and (3) **Immune pathways** – the release of cytokines and inflammatory mediators that can influence both gut inflammation and brain mood circuits [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24345032/#:~:text=morbidity%20of%20pain,We%20examined%20the%20effect%20of)[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24345032/#:~:text=GI,IAA%29%20to%20the%20sterile). Stress can disturb the normal function of all these pathways. For example, psychological stress has been shown to impair the stomach’s barrier function (making it “leaky” or more prone to inflammation), alter its motility (how it contracts and moves food), and even change the composition of gut bacteria [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24345032/#:~:text=morbidity%20of%20pain,We%20examined%20the%20effect%20of)[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24345032/#:~:text=GI,IAA%29%20to%20the%20sterile). These changes can precipitate or worsen gastritis.

It’s also noteworthy that women might be physiologically more susceptible to stress-related gastric changes, according to some animal studies. Research in rodents found that inducing gastritis (stomach inflammation) led to **anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in female rats**, but not in male rats, and this was linked to hyperactivity of the HPA stress axis in the females[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24345032/#:~:text=behavior,related%20manner). The female rats with gastritis showed elevated stress hormone activity and clear anxiety behaviors, whereas male rats did not – suggesting a possible sex-related sensitivity to gut inflammation’s effects on mood [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24345032/#:~:text=behavior,related%20manner). While animal findings don’t translate directly to humans, they reinforce the concept that gut inflammation can trigger stress responses and anxiety through neuroendocrine pathways. The key takeaway is that the biology of stress and digestion are deeply intertwined. If you experience chronic anxiety, your stomach is continuously receiving signals that can promote inflammation and pain. This makes gastritis more frequent or harder to heal in anxious individuals. It also sets the stage for the opposite direction of influence – where ongoing gastritis feeds back into anxiety.

# How Gastritis Symptoms Fuel Anxiety (Gut-to-Brain Signals)

Just as the brain can affect the gut, the **gut can send distress signals to the brain** that contribute to anxiety. The abdominal region is rich in nerves (sometimes called the “second brain” or enteric nervous system) that continuously communicate with our central nervous system. When the stomach lining is inflamed (as in gastritis) or when the stomach is upset, those nerve signals can change our emotional state. Anyone who has had an intense stomach flu or food poisoning knows that severe nausea or gut pain often comes with feelings of panic or doom – a visceral anxiety that seems to originate in the belly. In chronic gastritis, these signals may be subtler but persistent, creating a background of unease. The **Harvard Medical School** notes that “a troubled intestine can send signals to the brain, just as a troubled brain sends signals to the gut,” and that a person’s gastrointestinal distress can be *“the cause or the product of anxiety”*[health.harvard.edu](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection#:~:text=The%20brain%20has%20a%20direct,system%20are%20intimately%20connected). In gastritis, the inflammation and discomfort in the stomach act as a stressor on the body, which in turn can trigger the brain’s anxiety circuits.

One pathway for gut-to-brain communication is the **vagus nerve**, a large nerve that runs from the brainstem to various organs including the stomach. When the stomach is inflamed or irritated, signals via the vagus nerve can stimulate regions of the brain involved in emotion and fear. Research into conditions like H. pylori infection (a common cause of gastritis) provides an example. H. pylori causes chronic gastric inflammation, and interestingly, it has been *“strongly linked to mental illnesses, notably anxiety and depression”* in epidemiological studies [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377568614_New-Onset_Illness_Anxiety_Disorder_After_Heliobacter_Pylori_Infection_A_Case_Report#:~:text=pylori%20,pylori%20infection%20among)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377568614_New-Onset_Illness_Anxiety_Disorder_After_Heliobacter_Pylori_Infection_A_Case_Report#:~:text=children%20,ntal%20illnesses%2C%20notably%20anxiety%20and). Scientists hypothesize that *“H. pylori may alter mood regulations through interactions in \[the\] gut-brain axis”*, including vagus nerve signaling [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377568614_New-Onset_Illness_Anxiety_Disorder_After_Heliobacter_Pylori_Infection_A_Case_Report#:~:text=The%20gut,the%20central%20and%20enteric%20nervous). In addition, chronic gastritis or infection can activate the HPA axis (the body’s central stress response system). One case report of a young woman who developed illness anxiety disorder after a severe H. pylori gastritis infection noted that *“H. pylori produces chronic stress, resulting in a maladaptive rise in cortisol levels, which leads to mood disruption”*[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377568614_New-Onset_Illness_Anxiety_Disorder_After_Heliobacter_Pylori_Infection_A_Case_Report#:~:text=brain%20,adrenal). In simpler terms, the ongoing physical stress of the gastric inflammation led her body to pump out stress hormones, which likely contributed to her anxiety and even panic attacks. Indeed, this patient only began experiencing panic attacks and health anxiety **after** enduring gastritis symptoms and a positive H. pylori diagnosis [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377568614_New-Onset_Illness_Anxiety_Disorder_After_Heliobacter_Pylori_Infection_A_Case_Report#:~:text=ckups%2C%20even%20after%20reassurance). Once the stomach issue arose, it became the spark for her anxiety disorder.

Beyond specific infections, general **inflammation** in the gut can influence the brain. The immune cells in an inflamed stomach release cytokines (inflammatory signaling molecules) that can travel or send messages to the brain, often promoting feelings of sickness, fatigue, and anxiety. This is part of what’s known as “sickness behavior” – the body’s natural response to illness can include psychological effects like low mood or anxious vigilance. Chronic gastritis involves a sustained immune response in the stomach, so it’s plausible that it has chronic, subtle effects on mood via these immune-brain pathways. Animal studies, as mentioned, have demonstrated that experimentally induced gastric inflammation can *cause* anxiety-like behaviors [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24345032/#:~:text=behavior,related%20manner). The mechanism was traced to the neuroendocrine pathway (HPA axis activation) in those studies [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24345032/#:~:text=behavior,related%20manner), lending biological credence to what many patients report: **“When my stomach flares up, my anxiety skyrockets.”**

Another factor is the **gut microbiome** – the community of bacteria living in the digestive tract. Gastritis, especially when caused by H. pylori or other disruptions, can alter the composition of gut microbes. There is emerging evidence that gut microbiota imbalances can affect brain function and anxiety levels (often termed the microbiome-gut-brain connection). Disturbance in gut bacteria has been found in people with various GI diseases and is thought to potentially contribute to anxiety via byproducts that affect the nervous system [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=communication%20between%20the%20GI%20tract,reported%20that%20even%20patients%20with). Although research is still evolving, scientists believe that an unhealthy gut environment may send “bad” signals to the brain, perhaps through both the vagus nerve and immune system, influencing neurotransmitters that regulate anxiety. All these physiological pathways underscore that **gastritis is not just a local stomach issue** – it can have system-wide effects, including on mental wellbeing. So when the stomach is inflamed, it’s not surprising that the person might feel generally unwell and anxious. The body is essentially pressing an internal alarm bell.

# Misinterpretation of Stomach Symptoms and Health Anxiety

Apart from these involuntary physiological pathways, there is a major *psychological* component to how gastritis triggers health anxiety: the way the brain interprets the symptoms. People who suffer from health anxiety have certain cognitive tendencies: they often believe that **uncertainty about health is intolerable**, and they jump to conclusions that any symptom is evidence of a serious disease [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26093824/#:~:text=Catastrophic%20misinterpretations%20of%20bodily%20symptoms,metacognition%2C%20catastrophic%20misinterpretation%2C%20and%20health). Stomach-related symptoms are particularly prone to misinterpretation because they can be vague and persistent. Unlike a visible external injury, internal sensations are interpreted based on one’s mindset. If you have a cognitive schema that “stomach pain could mean cancer,” then a simple gastritis twinge can set off that schema immediately. Studies on health anxiety note that individuals hold *dysfunctional beliefs* about symptoms – for example, “any pain means something is dangerously wrong” – and these beliefs lead to **catastrophic misinterpretations** of bodily sensations [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26093824/#:~:text=Catastrophic%20misinterpretations%20of%20bodily%20symptoms,metacognition%2C%20catastrophic%20misinterpretation%2C%20and%20health). So, a person with these beliefs might feel some stomach discomfort and instantly conclude, “I must have a bleeding ulcer, or maybe a tumor,” skipping over more likely benign explanations.

This misinterpretation is fueled by *attention and focus*. People with health anxiety routinely scan their bodies for sensations. Unfortunately, the human body always has some sensations present (digestion is an active process!). If you focus on your abdomen long enough, you will notice gurgles, transient aches, or fullness. Once noticed, a person predisposed to health anxiety will amplify the sensation – a process sometimes called **somatosensory amplification**. The sensation feels more intense the more it is worried about. Anxiety itself can heighten pain perception; research shows that anxious individuals often perceive pain **more acutely** than others because their brains are more responsive to those signals [health.harvard.edu](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection#:~:text=can%20affect%20movement%20and%20contractions,of%20the%20GI%20tract). Stress can even make **normal** digestive sensations feel like pain [health.harvard.edu](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20many%20people%20with,existing%20pain%20seem%20even%20worse). So the cycle continues: minor pain causes anxiety, which boosts the pain, which confirms the person’s worst fears that “something is terribly wrong.” It becomes very hard to break out of this loop of interpretation without psychological intervention.

A concept called **“illness perception”** is useful here. Illness perception refers to the personal meaning a patient assigns to their condition – beliefs about how severe it is, how long it will last, how it was caused, and whether it’s controllable. Negative illness perceptions (e.g., “This gastritis is a sign of something awful; I’ll never get better”) strongly correlate with anxiety in gastrointestinal disorders [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=guided%20subsequent%20medical,as%20far%20as%20we%20know)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=negative%20illness%20perception%20were%20more,has%20not%20been%20reported%20previously). One study found that the relationship between symptom severity and anxiety was partly mediated by these perceptions – meaning that two patients with the same level of stomach pain might have different anxiety levels depending on how they *think* about that pain [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=After%20adjustments%20for%20key%20demographic,3)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=Conclusion). Those who see it as extremely threatening will be much more anxious. Individuals with health anxiety tend to hold **exaggerated perceptions of threat** from symptoms. For them, gastritis isn’t just an upset stomach; it’s a harbinger of possible life-threatening illness. This thought pattern triggers the body’s fear response (racing heart, sweating, panic feelings), reinforcing to the person that “I feel panicked, so there really must be something wrong internally.” Even after medical evaluation shows no serious disease beyond gastritis, the anxious individual often struggles to accept it. They may seek multiple opinions or repeatedly search the internet for what else could be wrong, a behavior that keeps the anxiety alive [mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/illness-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20373782#:~:text=function%20,of%20symptoms%20or%20possible%20illnesses).

To illustrate, consider a person with gastritis who experiences a burning pain after meals. A non-anxious interpretation might be, “This is a typical symptom of acid irritation; I might need to avoid spicy food and take an antacid.” The health-anxious interpretation could be, “Why is it burning? Could it be an ulcer? Ulcers can bleed or perforate… what if it’s cancer causing this pain?” The second interpretation unleashes a cascade of worry. Each burp or bout of nausea becomes hyper-significant. The person might start checking their stool or vomit for signs of blood obsessively, or constantly “tune in” to their belly sensations. They might avoid eating certain foods not just for caution but out of fear, or conversely, they might eat constantly because *temporarily* gastritis pain can ease with food – and if an empty stomach causes pain, they interpret hunger pangs as dangerous pain. These kinds of behaviors and thought patterns can severely impact one’s quality of life.

Crucially, **health anxiety is self-reinforcing**. If you strongly believe you are ill, you tend to seek evidence of it, consciously or not. Any bodily sensation can become such evidence. With gastritis, the sensations are readily available, especially if one’s anxiety actually *spurs more acid and irritation*, as described earlier. Thus, the psychological misinterpretation works hand-in-hand with the physical reality: worry inflames the gut, and the inflamed gut fuels more worry. Understanding this cognitive aspect is important, because it suggests that breaking the cycle may require **cognitive-behavioral strategies** to challenge catastrophic thoughts and retrain the way one responds to stomach symptoms. In fact, trials have shown that interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or stress reduction can improve not only anxiety but also the digestive symptoms themselves [health.harvard.edu](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20many%20people%20with,existing%20pain%20seem%20even%20worse). By reducing the misinterpretation of symptoms, patients can often find relief in both mind and body.

# The Vicious Cycle: Bi-Directional Reinforcement

Given all the above, it becomes clear that gastritis and anxiety can create a **vicious cycle** – each one aggravating the other in a looping fashion. This can be summarized in a stepwise cycle:

1. **Stress/Anxiety Initiation:** A person experiences psychological stress or anxiety (for example, due to life events or inherent anxiety disorder). This leads the brain to send signals to the gut (via stress hormones and nerves) that disturb normal stomach function – gastric acid output rises and protective factors decrease [unicamillus.org](https://unicamillus.org/en/news/stress-induced-gastritis-when-stress-affects-the-stomach/#:~:text=coffee%2C%20painkillers%2C%20and%20stomach%20infections,lecturer%20in%20Gastroenterology%20at%20UniCamillus). The stomach lining becomes more susceptible to irritation, potentially triggering or worsening gastritis symptoms.
2. **Onset of Gastritis Symptoms:** The individual begins to feel stomach discomfort – pain, burning, bloating, nausea. These symptoms might be directly caused by stress-related changes (so-called *“stress-induced gastritis”* in extreme cases) [unicamillus.org](https://unicamillus.org/en/news/stress-induced-gastritis-when-stress-affects-the-stomach/#:~:text=coffee%2C%20painkillers%2C%20and%20stomach%20infections,lecturer%20in%20Gastroenterology%20at%20UniCamillus). Even if the person already had gastritis (say from an infection or diet), stress makes the symptoms more pronounced. Now the **gut is in distress**, sending its own alarm signals back to the brain via the gut-brain axis.
3. **Misinterpretation and Health Anxiety:** The person notices the intensified stomach symptoms and interprets them through a lens of fear. Because anxiety heightens vigilance, the symptoms feel sharp and impossible to ignore [health.harvard.edu](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection#:~:text=can%20affect%20movement%20and%20contractions,of%20the%20GI%20tract). The mind leaps to catastrophic conclusions (“Something is seriously wrong in my stomach!”). The **health anxiety kicks into high gear**, with racing thoughts about possible dire causes. This mental state amplifies the perception of pain and discomfort even further.
4. **Physiological Anxiety Response:** As worry escalates, the body’s fight-or-flight response is activated *again*. Adrenaline and cortisol surge, which (just like in step 1) send signals to ramp up stomach acid, slow digestion, and tense the gut. The longer the anxiety lasts, the more the stomach lining remains under assault from this chemistry.
5. **Worsening Gastritis:** The increased acid and tension from step 4 further inflame the stomach. Gastritis symptoms may worsen or flare more frequently. The pain and nausea possibly increase, which serves as “confirmation” to the person that something is very wrong, reinforcing their catastrophic interpretation.
6. **Cycle Repeats:** With symptoms worse, the person’s health anxiety intensifies even more. They might seek emergency care or multiple doctor visits, but if tests show only gastritis and nothing more serious, they might momentarily feel relief only to start doubting (“Maybe they missed something”). The ongoing worry ensures that stress signals to the stomach persist, preventing the gastritis from fully healing. Thus, they remain caught in the loop.

This cyclical interplay is well supported by the understanding of the **brain-gut axis as a two-way street** [health.harvard.edu](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection#:~:text=The%20brain%20has%20a%20direct,system%20are%20intimately%20connected). In fact, the scientific consensus now often refers to many digestive disorders, including gastritis and functional dyspepsia, as **“Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction”**, acknowledging that psychological and gastrointestinal factors are perpetually influencing each other. As Harvard Health Publishing succinctly stated, *“the gut-brain connection can link anxiety to stomach problems and vice versa”*[health.harvard.edu](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection#:~:text=The%20gut,trigger%20symptoms%20in%20the%20gut). Another medical review similarly notes that a person’s stomach distress can be **both cause and effect** of anxiety and stress [health.harvard.edu](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection#:~:text=The%20brain%20has%20a%20direct,system%20are%20intimately%20connected).

Clinically, this means patients who only address one side of the equation often find incomplete relief. For example, treating gastritis with medication might help the stomach lining heal, but if intense health anxiety remains unaddressed, the patient might continue to suffer from perceived symptoms or quickly relapse under stress. Conversely, treating anxiety alone might reduce the stress hormone impact on the gut, but if an H. pylori infection or ongoing inflammation isn’t treated, the physical trigger for anxiety persists. It’s truly a **bi-directional feedback loop**, and breaking it often requires a comprehensive approach targeting both gut and mind.

Interestingly, awareness of this bidirectional loop is growing. A 2023 study emphasized integrating assessment of illness perception (how the patient thinks about their illness) into the care of chronic GI patients, because these perceptions mediate anxiety levels [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=After%20adjustments%20for%20key%20demographic,3)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=Conclusion). By intervening in patients’ beliefs – for instance, through education and cognitive-behavioral therapy – we can reduce health anxiety and thereby potentially ease the gastrointestinal symptoms as well. Indeed, multiple studies have found that **psychologically based therapies (like CBT, relaxation training, or gut-directed therapy)**, when added to standard medical treatment, lead to greater improvement in GI symptoms than medical treatment alone [health.harvard.edu](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20many%20people%20with,existing%20pain%20seem%20even%20worse). This is powerful evidence of the two-way street: calming the brain calms the gut, and calming the gut calms the brain.

# Conclusion

Gastritis and anxiety are deeply interconnected through both physiological and psychological pathways. On one hand, anxiety and stress can precipitate and worsen gastritis by altering stomach acid secretion, blood flow, and sensitivity – literally creating a stomach environment prone to inflammation and pain [unicamillus.org](https://unicamillus.org/en/news/stress-induced-gastritis-when-stress-affects-the-stomach/#:~:text=coffee%2C%20painkillers%2C%20and%20stomach%20infections,lecturer%20in%20Gastroenterology%20at%20UniCamillus)[unicamillus.org](https://unicamillus.org/en/news/stress-induced-gastritis-when-stress-affects-the-stomach/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CStress,%E2%80%9D). On the other hand, the pain and discomfort of gastritis send signals that can trigger anxiety, both through direct gut-brain communication (vagus nerve activation, HPA axis stress responses) and through the mind’s tendency to fear the worst when physical symptoms arise [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377568614_New-Onset_Illness_Anxiety_Disorder_After_Heliobacter_Pylori_Infection_A_Case_Report#:~:text=brain%20,adrenal)[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24345032/#:~:text=behavior,related%20manner). This two-way relationship can easily become a vicious cycle in which **gastritis symptoms and health anxiety reinforce one another**. A person with gastritis may develop intense health-related anxiety, constantly worrying that their stomach pain is a sign of something catastrophic. That worry itself then exacerbates the gastritis, validating their fears in a self-perpetuating loop. Scientific studies have documented this cycle: individuals with gastritis have higher odds of anxiety disorders [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23073472/#:~:text=relationships,increased%20odds%20of%20mood%20and), and those with higher anxiety often report worse gastric symptoms [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=After%20adjustments%20for%20key%20demographic,3)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10710098/#:~:text=Conclusion). The **brain-gut axis** provides a framework for understanding this: it is the network through which the brain and digestive system talk to each other in a continuous feedback loop [health.harvard.edu](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection#:~:text=The%20brain%20has%20a%20direct,system%20are%20intimately%20connected).

Crucially, recognizing that symptoms may be **“misinterpreted messages”** rather than signs of doom can help break the cycle. Gastritis pain is real, but the brain’s interpretation of what it means can amplify that pain into panic. Patients and clinicians are increasingly encouraged to address both the physical and mental aspects of gastritis. Approaches like stress reduction, therapy to reframe catastrophic thoughts, and relaxation techniques can complement medications (such as acid reducers or antibiotics for H. pylori) to heal the stomach. By treating the person holistically, the intense health anxiety that gastritis triggers can be alleviated. In summary, gastritis tends to trigger intense health anxiety because our brains naturally treat pain as a warning sign – and in an anxious mindset, that warning becomes a blaring alarm of serious illness. The symptoms of gastritis are often persistent and uncomfortable enough to keep that alarm ringing. Modern scientific insights remind us, however, that this alarm is a false alarm: **the gut and brain are playing off each other’s signals**, and by calming one, we can often calm the other. In practical terms, calming the “butterflies” in the stomach may indeed start with calming the worries in the mind, and vice versa, breaking the gut-anxiety cycle for better health overall.",1,1752277096.0,Gastritis,2,0.6,False

“Yeah,” Zack said, glancing up at Ashlie, then getting back to whipping up glass with his shirt that was already on the floor. Glass had also gone under the couch, which they had been making out in.

“Jesus Christ, it's everywhere,” Zack stuck his hand under the couch and tried to get it all. He, eager to impress Ashlie, lifted up the couch while she was still on it. His face went blank and his eyes filled with terror. 

Black empty eyes stared back at him from under the couch. He froze in fear but only for a second, his hand pulled back and he dropped the couch. Ashlie screamed, “what the hell, Zack?” 

“Your cat was under there,” he replied. “I-it just scratched me.”

“Zack, you know my moms allergic to cats, why would we have one in the house? What was under there?” She climbed down and tried to look under the couch. “Let me see.”

Zack quickly grabbed her and jerked her away, screaming, “no, don't look under there.”

I'll cover everything from accommodation to activities, including some money-saving tips I discovered along the way.

Accommodation: $200-400 per night
I stayed at a mid-range hotel in Manhattan, which set me back about $300 per night. You can find cheaper options in outer boroughs or through Airbnb, starting around $150-200. Luxury hotels easily run $500+ per night.

Transportation:
- Subway Pass (7-day unlimited): $34
- Airport transfer (each way): $60-90
- Occasional Uber/Lyft: $100-150 total

Food & Drinks: $70-100 per day
- Breakfast: $10-15 (coffee shops, bagel spots)
- Lunch: $15-25 (food trucks, delis)
- Dinner: $30-60 (restaurants)
- Drinks/snacks: $15-20

Activities (4 days):
- Museums (MoMA, Met): $25-30 each
- Empire State Building: $42
- Times Square (free)
- Central Park (free)
- Broadway show: $89-200
- Statue of Liberty ferry: $23.50

The highlight of my trip was definitely the Manhattan Helicopter Tour. While it might seem expensive at first ($249), seeing NYC's iconic skyline from above was absolutely worth it. You get incredible views of the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, and the Empire State Building in just 15 minutes. I booked through [this link](https://athometouch.com/Manhattan) and got a great deal.

Total Budget Breakdown (4 days):
- Budget: $800-1000
- Moderate: $1200-1500
- Luxury: $2000+

Money-saving tips:
1. Get the weekly subway pass
2. Visit museums during free admission hours
3. Book activities in advance
4. Stay in Brooklyn or Queens
5. Use food delivery apps with first-time discounts

Remember prices can vary significantly based on season and events. I visited during shoulder season (October) which offered decent weather and slightly lower prices than peak summer months.

Final thoughts: NYC isn't cheap, but with proper planning, you can experience the best of the city without completely breaking the bank. That helicopter tour might seem like a splurge, but it's one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences that gives you a completely different perspective of the city.

Would I do it again? Absolutely. Just make sure to book your activities in advance, especially the helicopter tour, as spots fill up quickly during peak season.",1,1752277008.0,LetsGoTravelers,0,1.0,False

Targeting budget-conscious travelers while preserving the signature warmth of Lebanese service, this bold move could shake up Middle Eastern skies. Between good deals and small trade-offs, MEA is embarking on a strategic shift that may well propel Lebanon’s entire aviation sector.

Facing soaring fares and near-monopoly on direct routes, Lebanon’s national carrier Middle East Airlines (MEA) is preparing to shake up the market. Led by Chairman Mohamad El Hout, MEA plans to launch a low-cost subsidiary in March 2027, according to insiders. The new airline will start with 4 aircraft and offer tickets up to 30% cheaper than current MEA fares.

This bold move marks a major strategic shift as MEA responds to rising regional competition and growing demand for affordable air travel.

The low-cost carrier will operate a fleet of narrow-body Airbus jets, with new A320neo and A321XLR models expected to be delivered in 2026. MEA has ordered 9 aircraft, including 4 A321XLRs, and aims to gradually expand to destinations such as Germany, Denmark, Egypt and several African countries. The focus will be on short- and medium-haul routes, perfectly suited for the low-cost business model.

A Brand-New Terminal for a Smooth Takeoff

To support this strategic shift, the new low-cost airline will be based in Terminal 2 of Beirut’s Rafic Hariri international airport, currently under development. This terminal will double the airport’s capacity, which is presently oversaturated, enabling more frequent, shorter and most importantly, more affordable flights.

The benefits are significant: fares up to 30% lower, greater accessibility for students, families and expatriates, and a strong boost for Lebanon’s tourism sector. With both MEA’s traditional and budget-friendly options available, passengers will finally have the freedom to choose flights that fit their budgets.

MEA’s “à la carte” model may surprise some travelers: checked baggage, seat selection and onboard meals will be optional paid extras. Meanwhile, until Terminal 2 is fully operational, the existing airport infrastructure may struggle to handle the increased traffic.

Another key challenge is avoiding a damaging rivalry between MEA’s traditional services and its low-cost subsidiary. If too many passengers shift to budget flights, the group’s overall financial balance could be at risk.

However, the fare reductions are significant. A Paris–Beirut ticket, often priced around €1,200, could drop to €800 or less—provided travelers pack light and skip onboard meals. Behind these lower prices lies a clear admission: current fares are too high, inflated by a near-monopoly and risk premiums.

By launching its low-cost arm, MEA is attempting a delicate balancing act, staying competitive in a mass market while preserving its premium clientele. If aircraft deliveries arrive on schedule, Terminal 2 opens as planned and extra fees remain reasonable, summer 2027 could usher in a new era of more accessible and less turbulent air travel from Beirut.",11,1752276923.0,lebanon,4,1.0,False

1lxlmlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lxlmlv/sugar_ap/,Sugar AP,"I am seriously asking this community if this has happened to anybody else. TL;DR I think my pAP was really a sugar baby pretending to be a married mom.

I posted an M4F ad seeking an affair and she responded.  I couldn't believe my luck at first that she was local checked alot of the boxes I was looking for. Instead I should have known that she was just too good to be true. 

After some OpSec verification that seemed legit, we exchanged pics but I should have seen it as a red flag 🚩.   We agreed to exchange pics but she gave me a nude where I sent a SFW. She laughed it off saying she should have specified what kind of pic to send. Of course I was immediately attracted but I think that was part of the bait. We texted well into the night and for a couple days after. She warned me that she recently broke up with her previous AP so I might be a rebound for her. This was another red flag  🚩 that I choose to ignore since I was too excited that this could be my first affair. We agreed to meet for coffee to see if there is any spark.

After coffee we agreed that we felt a spark but here is where it got weird. She proceeded to tell me how much of a broken person she is. Her business is not doing well and she needed time to get it back on track. This should have been an obvious red flag  🚩 but I was smitten at this point. Over the next few weeks I'm trying to arrange our next date while she kept giving me excuses. Finally she tells me that she has been in contact with her ex-AP who has offered financial help. Immediately I'm jealous and telling her he is trying to keep himself in her life mostly for the sex (which we never had BTW). 

After some time, I started to see her for what she was which is just a fantasy in my head. I stopped texting first to see if she would even notice. Finally she texted me out of the blue asking for money. I felt so stupid and dumb for falling into her honey trap. I'm not even sure if she is really married. The scariest part is who was that person I had coffee with. I read about these sextortion scams online but this person met with me IRL. 

Has this happened to anybody else before? I'm pretty certain that she is a sugar baby looking to take advantage of those of us seeking an affair. I really appreciate this community and looking forward to getting some feedback to my strange affair situation.

1lxljz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CongratsLikeImFive/comments/1lxljz2/i_won_employee_of_the_month/,I won employee of the month!,"I work as a therapist in substance abuse treatment. I just got my MA and am a registered intern, working toward my license. 

In January, my site rolled out an employee of the month thing, where any facilitator/therapist aside from the bosses could win for perfect attendance (including not having taken vacay time) and having their notes done on time. We didn’t have a big attendance issue to begin with, and my gripes about it in general aside (mental and physical health should be a priority, and they shouldn’t be incentivizing the opposite), it was nice to finally qualify (January I took a few days to visit family, February I got sick, March I qualified but the random name picked wasn’t mine, end of April/beginning of May I took a few days to visit family again and go to my graduation ceremony). When I did take my vacation time, I have to add, my supervisor complimented me on taking care of my mental and social health, so I think the incentive comes from the higher-ups. I keep my head down, do my job, learn and am affable. Once in a while I get annoyed by little things, but so far it’s all been pretty little, knock on wood. Winning just felt really nice, if only for my own personal pride.

For context - I am almost 39. I had worked in retail for over 10 years by the time I was 30, back in July 2017. I was working at a big-box, blue hardware retailer and had been for 3 years. I filled in when and where possible, all the time. I was usually the first person they called to fill in because they knew I took it a lot. I worked myself to the bone, more out of personal pride, accomplishment, and sense of duty. Long story short, I got used and abused. For months I had been passed over for employee of the month, again and again, despite genuinely working my butt off and “being a team player” and all that. I wasn’t in a great place mentally and was desperate for external validation. One particular month, I was so *sure* I was going to get it in my department. I had had multiple customer compliments, they loved me and the fun chalkboard drawings I did for the recent promos and such, and I had gone out of my way for months to fill in for my boss who had been out for a while with knee surgery. She had come back, but mostly sat on her behind and “delegated,” which honestly wasn’t a huge change from before her surgery.

They called our department, aaand… my *boss* won. For “being so brave in returning to work.” I was so hurt. I wanted to sob. Maybe it was just a crummy $10 Dunkin card to most people, but to me it was just a huge sign that nobody noticed all my effort. I felt worthless. There were a lot of other things about that job that contributed to my dissatisfaction, but that felt like the final straw. I remember standing at the counter and thinking, “Is this the rest of my life?” 

I decided to go back to school. I left that job the same month I started attending school, and though I worked other retail for a few years, eventually I got my BA in human services. Yay! Then Covid hit right after. My job wasn’t giving consistent hours. I asked my boss what I could do to “move up.” He said I’d need a Master’s degree. All right. I liked that job but had to leave when I moved states. Worked a couple more crummy jobs (in my field, but still not good), just got my MA. I know that’s a big accomplishment, one I barely even dreamed of 8 years ago when I was still working at the hardware place. 

And now here I am, working as a therapist in substance abuse. I don’t dread going into work. I don’t fantasize about calling out. I don’t cry going in or coming home because of the stress. And I just won employee of the month, and got a $100 Amazon gift card, simply for doing my job I would do even without the incentive. And it just hit me in a weird way - almost exactly 8 years ago, I hadn’t even started going back for my BA yet. I had just been passed over for a measly $10 card for some cheap fast food coffee, despite working myself to practically exhaustion. That rejection (combined with a few other things) sent me places I never thought I would reach. And how funny that if they had just given me $10 and some basic thanks, it probably would have placated me enough to stay where I was.

The good:

\- If you are business or engineering the buildings are absolutely great and there are lots of resources for you to succeed (career counseling, resume workshops, free headshots, and many ways to add to your resume)

\- Because it's a big school, there are lots of RSOs you can join from dancing to singing to whatever you like

\- UIUC has lots of connections and alumni and if you attend the career fair a lot of good companies come here 

\- If you like overpriced coffee and boba tea or chinese food you are going to like it here

\- Big greek life and partying if that is your thing

\- it's quite beautiful and vibrant and lively when its not cold 

\- most of the professors are quite nice/resourceful, always one or two bad apples (but that's normal)

\- unless you hangout with like cutthroat business or cs kids most people here are chill 

  
The bad 

\- Petty theft is everywhere to the point where you really have to watch out

\- weather... hope you like iceskating and free showers 

\- Homeless population can be a bit of an issue (harassing students) , same with occassional gunshots 

\- Large international student population + racial tension which isn't as talked about as much

\- the housing situation can be not great at times... don't be surprised if at 3am there's a fire alarm going off

\- course registration... good luck

\- heard if you aren't business or engineering there isn't as much resources poured in

I had my first successful harvest which I then dehydrated and tried grinding into powder. However, I didn’t know that there was an additional process I could do to make it easier to dehydrate and grind so it could become finer.

As a result, I have a lot of this fluffy, partially-ground reishi. It’s nearly impossible to encapsulate, I’ve dehydrated it for +48 hours, and when I go to grind it, some of it does finely ground but for the most part it remains like this. I’ve tried a regular coffee grinder and I have a high-powered grinder too. I also dehydrated some fruits from that harvest even further, to where they snap easily and tried grinding that but no luck—same fluffy result.

1. Any ideas as to what I can do with this fluffy reishi? I’ve considered making chocolate bars with it but that seems like a lot of work. Maybe I could make it into tea bags or mix it with coffee grounds to make reishi coffee? Is it too late to make it into a tincture?

In the desert of Lindsahr, under the scorching glare of an angry, red sun, the sands shifted beneath Nimrod's feet. It was the alarm, but out of time.
He grabbed his spear and bag of poisons, wrapped the old, torn cloth around his head and face, and set towards the movement.
The heat was unbearable, as searing as any open flame, but constant, unyielding to wind and never out of kindling.
""Gods dammit, why are they shifting now? What's wrong with these things?"" He hated the day, but keeping sandworm patterns required following their schedule, and recently, they'd been all out of whack.
He passed his hand along his chin, stubble lightly scratching his fingers. ""I don't like this; the trails are uneven, scattered, like they don't know where they're going."" He tried to understand the recent change, but nothing lined up on the timeline, nothing except...
His gaze turned to the horizon, to the desert's edge, closer by the day. There, the sands slowly gave way, replaced by fertile blood soil. Most people cherished it, but Nimrod felt.. differently. He'd, of course, eaten from those fields; hell, he'd cried his eyes out at being full for the first time...

 But the desert was dying, a part of them was dying. Could the others not see it?
He trekked back to his tribe. Well, it was a village now. They had enough food for it, and wood.

 ""Gods, I don't think I'll ever get used to these creaky things,"" he complained as he dragged his feet across the floorboards.  Inside a small room, well-lit by candles and marked by strewn maps across the small table and floor, he found a familiar scene: Kalil, she was hunched over the maps, dusty glasses upon her pointy nose, tongue slipping out as she analyzed the maps with the intensity of a grandmother checking a shirt for stains.
Nimrod smiled, sneaked up on her, and tapped her shoulder lightly. ""I'm back. Found anything good?"" Kalil jumped like a startled cat. ""DON'T!... Oh, it's you, Nimrod. Sorry, I've just been locked on these tracks you mapped. I can't for the life of me understand them. It's like we're not looking at the same creatures anymore."" Her gaze turned to the small, curtained window, a small cloud in the distance, under the always watching blue sky. ""No surfacings yet either, I assume?""
""No,"" Nimrod shook his head.
Kalil replied, ""So getting one's still impossible. God, how am I supposed to do my job without a specimen? I'm a cataloguer by her sake! Ughh!""

 She threw her hands up wildly, knocking over papers and a cup of the Empire's new commodity: coffee.

Nimrod chuckled, picked up the papers and cup, and kissed her head. ""You'll figure it out. If not, then even the moon couldn't answer."" He nestled her hair. ""

Got to get some sleep, okay? You've been at it for two days now. I don't think this coffee thing's good for you.""

""It keeps me up. And I need to think. If we don't figure this out, the whole desert could...""

""Shhh, I know, but a brain on fumes is good for no one,"" he said, quoting her own words.
She finally relented, and both headed off to the strange new framed bed at their ""house."" God, that'd take some getting used to, both thought in unison.


Nimrod turned in bed, dreams filled with images of twisting sands and dark shadows. Beside him, Kalil seemed deep asleep, exhaustion finally catching up to her.
He stirred a bit more until deciding to get up; sleep wasn't any good right now, and he could go over today's charts again. He made his way down the corridor, but when he touched the handle, his feet trembled. He felt a familiar shiver, and smiled.
Not long after, the alarm system confirmed his thoughts. The rocks attached to ropes in the underground openings started rattling. A worm, a big one by the sounds of it.
Nimrod quickly turned it off before Kalil could hear it. What better gift than a worm and breakfast in bed? He made his way outside, then he stood at the center of a clearing in the sands, and started stomping.
""Tu. Tututu.tutu.tu.""
Not long after, the sand under him shifted, mounds rising and falling like angry waves in a granular sea. Then, in what felt like an instant, it emerged.
Nimrod smiled, at least until he took a look at it. Then, his knees shook for the first time since he was a child lost in the night desert, and that had been from cold.
Before him stood the biggest... worm? He ever saw. Easily seven palm trees high, but instead of the tanned creature he expected, it was pale, almost translucent. Inside its see-through body, dark veins pulsed ominously. Its mouth, now a gaping hole of darkness, had no teeth in sight, and the most disturbing part: at its bottom, sewn in like some shaman's twisted joke, were hundreds of... spider legs? Nimrod recognized them. Dune horrors, but never left their sand dungeons, waiting to snap whatever came up.

""None of this makes sense!"" He ran inside to wake up Kalil; he needed help. But before he could reach her, an inhuman screech blasted through his chest. He actually lost his footing for a moment, ears ringing. When he looked behind, he lost all color.
In a wave of horrible, unnatural movement, the segmented worm body pushed itself forward while the spider legs tried wildly to rule their actions. And it was coming at him, too fast. The void-like mouth was right on top of him. The rotten meat smell he had come to expect was gone, replaced by the light, sickly-sweet smell of the Empire's new fruits. Nimrod braced for the worst, his eyes shutting so his last thought would be Kalil, but then... he felt it, right under his elbow. A rope.
Nimrod pulled on it, hard. The base of the observatory tower shrieked and tumbled on top of him and the worm, straw and dry wood burying the two.
The worm thrashed and squirmed; it was a matter of time before it found its way out. Then, Nimrod heard her. ""Nim! Where are you! God damn it, answer me!"" Her voice was angry, slightly desperate but trying to keep it together. Nimrod smiled; she sounded like she did intheir first visit to the capital.  
 
Nimrod screamed, ""The tower, Kalil! It's no worm, it's a monster! I got it trapped but not for long!""
He looked at her through the debris. She scouted for him, and the shine of his emerald eyes in the moonlight drew her in. In that moment, he smiled, and said, ""love you moonflower"" 

Nimrod then struggled through the wood to reach his pocket, to reach his flint and steel. Kalil noticed; the worm started getting itself through the debris. Twisting, angry spider legs poking through the holes, pushing the giant worm body up. The structure started crumbling.
A giant piece of a cracked beam bore down upon Nimrod. He tried to roll to the side, but he didn't have room. The javelin-like dry wood stabbed through his shoulder. He cried in pain, his hand opened, and his flint fell through the cracks.
""Fuck!"" he thought. There was only one way now, and he hated it. ""Kalil, do it. Please!""
He stared through the crack. He couldn't hear her clearly anymore. Her eyes were filled with tears thicker than scorpion's blood; her words reached him in chunks.
""What?... idiot....can't I...you too...""
Then a flicker in her hand. She turned away. Nimrod smiled. Then, there was blinding light, and darkness. ",1,1752275874.0,writers,1,1.0,False

I used Nora Cook's chocolate chip cookies recipe, but I didn't have any corn starch so I experimented a bit. I added 1/3 cup aquafaba, 1/4 cup flour and 2 ^(1/2) tbsp. Cocoa powder. I also did 1 tsp *strong* coffee instead of the second tsp of vanilla extract (and I used vanilla bean paste not extract). I ended up putting the cookie dough on the sheet then into the freezer for 30 minutes and the bowl of the rest of the dough in the refrigerator. Baked perfect at 350° F for 18 minutes and the dough was perfect after being in the fridge. Texture and flavor 10/10.

1lxlei2,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1lxlei2/heavy_beating_heart/,Heavy beating heart,"Hello all. Im gonna give some backstory first. I’m currently on vacation, in a country that’s 20 degrees celcius hotter than my origin country. 10 degrees to 30+ degrees and sun. 

We’ve been here for almost 2 weeks now, and I didn’t seem to have any issues at the start of the vacation, but  around halfway, (1 week) after drinking just 1-2 0,33l boxes of beer, it feels like my heart is beating extremely hard. Yet, heart doesn’t go above 100 BPM. More like around 80s, problem is this beating can last for a couple of hours before I fall asleep and wake up normal. 

Yesterday, I tried drinking some wine instead, and that didn’t give me any abnormalities. Me and my gf ended up sharing a full bottle. 

Today, I tried to take 2 zips of beer, and the beating started. I topped in at 98 BPM at peak, but only for a few minutes before it dropped down to my usual 65-70BPM. The heavy beating continued for a couple of hours and I’m now fine again, normal heart, normal beating. 

I’ve been drinking just around 1.5/2L of water/ice tea each day with a cup or two of coffee. so could it be dehydration issues? I’ve never had this problem with beer before, and I’ve never had any heart «issues» before. I must say I’ve had health anxiety before, but never over my heart, this started like a week before we went here. 

Currently sitting at 62 BPM",2,1752275752.0,askCardiology,0,1.0,False

1lxlcbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1lxlcbl/trip_itinerary_9_days_lf_ma_pls_give_feedback/,"Trip itinerary 9 days LF & MA, pls give feedback","Hi! Family of 4 with 18 and 15 yr old flying into SJO from SFO. Please provide any feedback. 

Land in SJO at 7:15am on July 19 on a red eye flight.

Arenal/La Fortuna area:
Check in Sat July 19 and check out Wed July 23:
4 nights at hotel Arenal Spring

Manuel Antonio area:
Check in Wed July 23 check out Sat July 26:
3 nights at Los Altos resort.com

Fly out Sun July 27 at 8:45am from SJO! Booked Hampton Inn near the airport to stay on July 26 for one night.

Teenagers want to zipline, hike to waterfalls, chill in hot springs, see the volcano, see wildlife esp monkeys. Fairly fit family and can do medium hikes. Do not plan on renting a car due to windy roads and rainy season.

Here are some questions:
1. Should I book iltcostarica for all my transport between Cities. 
2. We would like to see Rio Agrio falls on way to La Fortuna from SJO. Worth it?
3. would Uber app work in LF and MA area to get to town from hotel and back for dinners etc.
4. Should I prebook the tours or wait to get to the resorts and book with them? Older child wants to go to a proper hot springs even though our resort has them. Tabacon maybe?
5. Due to distance and rains I am considering ditching Rio Celeste. Hopefully Rio Agrio will make up for it.
6. Here are the tours I would like to book in the LF area: Sky Adventure zip line and bridges, Volcano hike, La Fortuna waterfall, river safari, night hike, coffee/chocolate tour. Seems like I have more places than I have days lol. Pls help organize or suggest the tour dates.
7. Travel from LF to MA would like to stop at the crocodile bridge, river pontoon at eco jungle cruises.stop at Jaco? Or would it be better to just get to MA straight as we don't have as many days in MA
8. Want to tour Manuel Antonio national Park, night mangrove tour, Nauyuca falls. Maybe a day trip to Uvita? Again same problem, more desires than days available. Pls help plan how to manage day tours, should I book ahead of time or just do it with the resort once we arrive
9. On July 26 should we check out from MA and get to SJO area hotel by nightfall with sightseeing on the way or leave MA area as late as possible and just drive straight to SJO to crash at the hotel.

Thank you so much for reading all of my questions and hope I can get some of your insights. Can't wait to get to Costa Rica!!!

The recipe has 1 cup of STRONG coffee 😅

When I looked it up, apparently caffeine doesn’t burn off with heat and technically “there’s no safe amount of caffeine for children.”

Do I remake it and freeze the cake layers for a later date? 

Thoughts? 😆

She mostly drinks supermarket coffee, which she ground at the store, with pressurized baskets. But now that we have the vario, I ordered a bottomless portafilter and unpressurized baskets, which gives me the chance to gift some fancy coffees in the future.

But to set things into perspective, she is happy with her store ground coffee and pressurized filters. I try not to push too much coffee snobbery, but a good grinder really has its benefits ofc ;)

1lxlajn,https://www.reddit.com/r/northcounty/comments/1lxlajn/fatigue_doctor_recs/,Fatigue Doctor Recs,"Hi all — I’m a 30-year-old male looking for help navigating persistent low energy, brain fog, and a “wired but tired” feeling that’s been with me for years — maybe even since my teens.

I’m a healthy weight, exercise regularly, walk outdoors, and try to eat a balanced diet — but I rarely wake up feeling rested. I crash hard in the afternoons (12–3 PM) and rely on about two cups of coffee per day to stay functional. Without caffeine, I feel like I could sleep for hours more. Been trying to lower caffeine intake lately. 

Last October I had standard bloodwork done, but didn’t get much insight from it. Results were all within normal range...B12, Folate, thyroid, testosterone, etc were all measured. Before I dive into expensive next steps like genetic testing or advanced panels, I wanted to ask this community for thoughts. I’m wondering if it makes sense to explore:

* **Thyroid or adrenal issues**
* **Nutrient deficiencies**
* **Food sensitivities or gut-related causes**

If you’ve worked with someone in NCSD, SD, or even virtually who helped you get to the root of similar issues, I’d be grateful for **any recommendations (MD, naturopath, or integrative practitioner)** — especially if you can give a rough idea of cost and what to expect. My MD is well-intentioned but hard to see and doesn't seem to be able to point me in the right direction on this. Feeling like this daily doesn't seem right.

Appreciate any insights or direction you can offer. Thanks!",3,1752275448.0,northcounty,14,0.8,False
