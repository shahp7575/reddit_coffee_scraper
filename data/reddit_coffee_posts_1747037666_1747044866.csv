Rolled into a town called Ashridge just before sunset. Never even heard of it before. The sign said “Pop. 412” but it felt way emptier than that. Place looked like it hadn’t aged past 1960. Everything’s still. Like the wind don’t even know this place exists.
Gas was low. El Camino ‘67 cherry red, my baby was choking fumes. Had no choice.

Got a room at a dusty little motel. No questions asked. Just room 6, key slid over the counter like they’d been expecting me or something. Lights flicker. Whole room smells like wet carpet and dead time. Can’t explain it better than that.
Anyway, just needed a place to crash.


Day 2

People here don’t talk much. Ate at some diner “Lou’s.” Lady working there, Janie, looked like she hadn’t smiled in ten years. I asked if this town always this dead. She just blinked at me, poured more coffee, and said, “Quieter now.” Whatever the hell that means.

Couldn’t sleep last night. Kept thinking I heard my name outside. Whispering. Too soft to catch, but enough to keep my eyes open till dawn. Checked outside, nothing. Just puddles and that busted neon sign buzzing like a bug zapper.


Day 3

Dreamt I was standing in the middle of town. Alone. No lights, no sounds, no stars, just gray. There was someone there, at the end of the street. Shadowy, couldn’t see the face, but it was watching. I couldn’t move. Felt like something sat on my chest.

Woke up gasping. Clock was frozen at 3:33 a.m. Not joking. Won’t forget that number.

Car’s dead. Engine looks… off. Not broken, more like emptied. No oil. No sound. But the gas gauge’s full? Wasn’t yesterday.

Walked into town to ask for a mechanic. The guy at the hardware store looked right through me and said, “Red car’s cursed.” Then he slammed the door.


Day 4

Town’s changing. I swear it is. A house that was boarded up yesterday looked brand new this morning. Then it was gone by afternoon. Not run-down. GONE. Overgrown lot, like nothing had stood there in decades.

Saw a kid’s trike sitting in the road. No kid. Dust on it like no one’s touched it in years. It was spinning when I found it.

Didn’t sleep at all. Whispers were louder. Inside now. I put a chair under the doorknob. Slept with the knife from my glove box under my pillow. What am I even writing…


Day 5

Tried to leave. Took the El Camino out. Drove for hours. I swear I did. But every turn, every curve, every goddamn mile, led me back to that gas station. The one by the town sign. Over and over again.

Stopped in the middle of the road. Screamed till my throat cracked. No answer. Just silence. Like the town was waiting for something.

Dream again. The shadow thing said my name this time. It knew me. “Remember,” it said. One word. But it echoed for miles.

Woke up with a burn on my shoulder. Shaped like a hand.


Day 6

It’s her.
It’s Ash.
I remember now.

The crash. The screaming. My hands slick with blood. The El Camino wrapped around that pole. She died. I lived. Or… something like it.

Ashridge. Ash-ridge.
It wasn’t a town. It was her name.

I left everything behind after that. Didn’t even go to the funeral. Just hit the road. Been drifting ever since.


Day 7

Car started. No reason it should, but it did. Engine purring like a cat. Sun’s out. Town looks almost normal again, like none of it happened.

But I saw the town sign one last time in the mirror. Burnt around the edges. And under the population, scratched in what looked like fresh black paint, was:

“You came back.”

I don’t think I ever left.

The Lost Journal Continued…

Journal Entry – Day 8
Left Ashridge. I think. Drove until the sun dipped under the hills, then kept going. Highway stretched like it was stitched into the night. No signs. No cars. Just me, the El Camino, and static on every station.

Stopped at a diner outside Pine Vale. Lights were on, but no one inside. Food half-eaten on the counter like folks vanished mid-bite. Coffee still warm. I waited. Called out. Nothing. Took a piece of pie and left cash on the counter. Felt wrong.

Driving again. No matter where I turn, there’s fog now. Low. Heavy. Like it’s crawling. The road’s starting to look the same in every direction.


Day 9

There’s a new mark on my shoulder. Opposite the handprint. Looks like… an eye? I swear I didn’t see it this morning. It itches like hell.

Heard something behind me on the road. Like metal scraping. Checked the mirrors. Empty. But when I stopped and got out, the asphalt was burned in the shape of footprints. Bare feet. Charred.

El Camino’s acting weird again. Radio crackles on by itself. Catches words I didn’t say. Once, I heard: “You know what you owe.”

I didn’t sleep.


Day 10

Woke up parked on the shoulder. I don’t remember stopping. Glove box was open. My dad’s old army dog tags were on the seat. Thing is, I lost them five years ago. Middle of Nevada.

The sky’s off. I don’t know how to explain it. Clouds don’t move. Sun rises… but it’s pale. Like a memory of sunlight.

I passed a billboard with no ad on it, just red paint dripping down the wood. It said:

“YOU’RE NOT DONE.”

The handwriting was mine.


Day 11

Saw her. Ash.
Just… standing in the middle of the road, a few miles outside Hollow’s Bend. Long black hair. Same white tee she was wearing that night. Blood on it. A lot of it.

I hit the brakes. She vanished. Not like disappeared, like she unstitched from the air. Threads pulled loose.

I’m losing time again. These entries might not be in order. Or maybe I’m writing in my sleep.


Day 12?

Found another town. No name. No people. Gas pumps still running. Newspapers stacked on the sidewalk, dated 1997. All the headlines are about fires. The photos are of me.

One showed me standing in front of the wreck the El Camino mangled around a pole. But there’s something wrong. In the reflection of the windshield, I’m smiling.

Checked my face in the mirror after that. Couldn’t recognize myself for a second. Eyes weren’t mine. Too dark.


Next entry – no date

Saw my old house. From when I was a kid. Out in Mississippi. White fence. Porch swing. The tree I used to climb. Except the tree was on fire. And the swing was moving.

Went inside. Everything’s exactly how I remember it. Except my mom, she’s sitting at the kitchen table. Staring. Not breathing. She’s been dead ten years.

She said, “You don’t get to drive away from this.”
Then she smiled. Her teeth were gone. Just blackness.


Entry — who cares what day it is

Ash is with me now.
I see her in the rearview every night. Sometimes in the passenger seat. Never says much. Just hums. Same tune over and over.

Sometimes, I hum with her. It’s easier than screaming.

I think this road was built for me. Or maybe I built it. Out of guilt, or bones, or dreams, I dunno.

But I get it now. This isn’t about punishment.
It’s about remembering.

And maybe that’s worse.

1kkotyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1kkotyf/got_scammed_ng_isang_wedding_supplier_and_ayoko/,got scammed ng isang wedding supplier and ayoko mag settle,"Ilang weeks na from the wedding and sinusubukan kong kalimutan or i-let go yung disappointment ko kaso tuwing nakikita ko yung mga pictures from our wedding talagang nababadtrip ako. Kwento ko lang kasi talaga namang nakakapanlumo eh. 

So I had my wedding last April and I engaged this supplier as a reception stylist. Initially, 30k ang agreement namin for the styling ng tables and surrounding areas. Basically, ang focus ng styling was the tablescape talaga kasi sa beach ang reception. Nung pinakita ko sakanya yung inspo, nag agree naman siya at siya ang nag set ng presyo at 30k.

Around January, nag meet kami and I decided na sakanya na rin kumuha ng coffee bar and flowers for church and entourage para hindi naman siya lugi, considering na from Manila siya at yung wedding was in Quezon. By January 20, nag pa downpayment siya ng another 15k for the styling and for the coffee bar. Sinabi niya rin na she will send the contract on that day, pero wala. 

Then come the end of February, she asked again to make a partial payment of 15k para daw makabili sila ng additional vases and candles. I paid her. I was also still waiting for the contract, pero wala pa rin. 

Around end of March, together with my coordinator, nag meeting kami via Zoom to finalize things. After that meeting, nag chat siya via FB Messenger na baka mag increase talaga yung price ng styling for the tablescape. In her exact words: “Parang nasa atleast 80k all in na po siya kasi nasa 45k po yung styling na. Pinag uusapan pa po namin update po namin kayo today. Talagang up for 80k talaga siya mam."" So I clarified with her if tama yung breakdown ko, which she confirmed na tama:

* **30k -- initial reception venue styling (increased to 40k)**
* 10k -- coffee bar
* 30k -- flower entourage and church arrangement

By April 3, sabi niya mag sesend siya ng contract. She gave me via chat the final breakdown ng services niya + the pictures of the contract:

* **60k -- reception styling**
* 30k -- flower entourage and church arrangement
* 15k -- coffee bar for 150 pax

Nagulat ako kasi nag-increase na naman yung sa reception styling, this time, from 45k to 60k naman. In her defense, yung 80k daw na sinasabi niya na all-in was for the church and styling and nag compute daw sila per table sa gagamitin na materials, 800 led lights and moving candles na daw since 100 per table ang gagamitin. Nag adjust din daw siya sa size ng led candle na gagamitin kasi gusto niya maganda yung set-up kasi hindi daw mag ccomplement sa BIG VASES yung maliliit na led candles.

Nag online meeting kami a few days after para i-discuss yung contract na sinend niya. Sobrang red flag na pero wala na akong choice but to trust her kasi April na. I tried haggling the price kasi nag double from the original price, pero she insisted na fixed na yon. Syempre since malapit na, nag go na rin ako.

Gusto niya rin na mag full payment na ako a week before para daw makapag prepare sila ng materials. Puro assurances pa siya na wag mag worry, na I can vouch them naman daw. Na she wants to be paid in full lang talaga kasi na trauma daw sila from their last event sa S Maison kasi hindi sila binayaran. As per her message, ""Sad to say kaya we always have the contract na masunod."" Ang ironic lang na sa contract namin halos puro violation. 

By April 20, nag follow-up ulit siya for the payment, nag bayad ako ng 30k and sabi ko na yung remaining 20k on the day of the event ko na babayaran for security purposes. All in all, ang naging presyo ng services niya hit 105k. And it was almost paid by 80% bago pa dumating ang kasal.

Come wedding day, ito na nga, ito na yung mga napansin ko:

1. First, palanta na yung bouquet ko. Pag dating ko sa simbahan, bago pa ako mag lakad, lupaypay na yung ibang rose. I want to give the benefit of the doubt na baka mainit lang.

2. Second, while on the way sa simbahan, pinakita sa akin nung bride attendant yung itsura nung church flowers/arrangement. Disappointed na naman ako kasi iba yung itsura sa usapan namin. Pero sabi na hindi pa raw nakakapag set-up yung stylist so medyo nakampante ako kasi baka yung mga set-up na nasa picture na pinakita sakin is yung set-up pa nung previous na kasal. 

Kaso wala, pag kita ko sa simbahan, hindi naman talaga inayos. Pinatong lang yung flowers galing sakanila. Wala na rin time mag ayos kasi according to my coordinator, nag papapila na ng entourage nung nag lalapag sila ng bulaklak. So that says a lot kung talagang prepared ba sila. Hired stylist siya for the church and venue and may reasonable expectation na maayos at cohesive yung individual elements na pinag usapan. 

3. Third, habang nag aantay na ako sa labas ng simbahan, sumilip ako sa awang ng pinto. Nakita ko na may flower arch. Malinaw na malinaw sa usapan namin na ayoko ng flower arch. Pero wala hinayaan ko na kasi andon na eh. Nung nag lakad na ako, napansin ko na yung mga bulaklak iba iba, hindi nag ccomplement sa isat isa kasi nga nilapag na lang nila yung flowers from them kasi gahol na sila sa oras dahil late sila dumating sa church. In short, pangit.

4. Fourth, may cloth sa gilid ng aisle pero halos sampung seat lang meron, hindi man lang simula altar hanggang dulo. Di ko sigurado kung sakanila ba yun, pero since siya ang stylist, sana inayos man lang nila or tinanggal nalang kung kakarampot lang din naman yung malalagyan. 

5. Fifth, sa 2 sintra board na usapan, isa lang ang andon -- yung picture namin na akala mo anemic dahil walang kakulay kulay.  Walang welcome signage and wala rin yung selfie mirror na sinasabi niya. Though, nabasag daw yung selfie mirror during set-up. Pero still, as a stylist dapat may contingency plans sila kasi hindi pwede na puro excuses at sorry ang ibibigay kasi bayad sila e.  

6. Sixth, wala yung 2 rattan basket na supposedly lalagyan ng mga fans. Ilang beses daw hinihingi nung coordinator pero puro wait, hanggang sa wala na. Tingin ko wala talaga kasi the whole time ng kasal, nandon siya. Kung meron man, sana nalagay kahit late na. Pero wala. Yung easel na pinag lagyan ng sintra board, coordinator pa nag provide. 

7. Seventh, wala rin set-up/styling of any sort yung yung registration table. Hindi niya pwedeng idahilan na mahangin at natutumba dahil yung pwesto nung registration table was nasa garden at hindi mahangin. 

8. Eight, pag-pasok ko ng beach area (reception) yung tablescape na supposedly worth 60k, sobrang underwhelming. Yung supposed BIG VASES puro baso na may tubig -- walang floating candles at sand design na sinasabi niya na meron, halos walang variarion sa size. Masakit pa jan yung mga baso na may tubig baka nainom pa ng guests kasi walang indicator na “vase” siya e kasi wala naman lumulutang na candle nor sand na laman. Further, ang lalaki ng gap, hindi man lang napuno. Sobrang nakakabadtrip talaga. 

During reception, kada daan ko sa mga tables binilang ko yung candles, hindi man lang umabot ng 30. Yung table runner, ang layo sa color na pinag-usapan. Yung itsura parang pinulot lang sa tira-tira nila. Sobrang disheartening considering yung price increase.

9. Ninth, nung dumating na yung mga flowers galing sa church, nilagay nila sa tables para hindi mapansin yung gaps. Malinaw usapan namin na walang bulaklak sa tables.

10. Tenth, bumili ako ng shells as additional sa tables. Pero parang tinipid pa pag lalagay. 

11. Eleventh, sa contract may charger plates for the VIPs. Pero wala rin.

12. Twelfth, walang mga names ng guests per seat kasi nililipad daw. (The point is, dapat ready sila. They should have contingency plans). Baka pati adhesive tape wala sila or baka in truth, hindi naman talaga ginawa.

13. Thirteenth, naubos daw agad yung drinks sa coffee bar and nag exceed pa daw ng 200 pax. How come nag exceed when she mentioned noon pa lang na hindi sila makakapag dala ng buffer drink beyond 180 pax kasi ibbrew pa. Also, ang daming hindi umattend sa bisita namin. Tapos biglang nag exceed. Wala ring customized names sa cups as agreed. At halos lahat ng guest, when I asked them kung kumusta yung drinks ng coffee bar, walang lasa. Lasang tubig. 

How can I trust her words na nag exceed talaga when ang daming red flags during the event itself? 

14. Fourteenth, tapos na yung wedding nung nalaman ko. Yung flowers nung flower girls hindi rin nasunod. Ginawa niyang flower basket na hindi naman yun ang agreement. 

Yung flowers ng entourage, nilagyan nya ng BLUE RIBBON. She knows the color motif, so that says a lot. Wala sa color motif namin ang royal blue! 

15. Fifteenth, sinabi rin ng coordinator na understaffed siya. 

Initially, I really wanted to ask for a refund dahil technically speaking, violated ang contract. I messaged her thru FB, I expressed my extreme dissatisfaction kaso puro excuses lang. Ending bnlock ko nalang siya kasi ayoko mataint yung memory. Kaso pag nakikita ko yung mga pictures sa kasal, nattrigger talaga ako to the point na gusto ko mag file civil case just to have some justice sa nangyari. 

 I know hindi controlled ang lahat ng bagay, pero as a stylist and a service provider, dapat merong contigency plans kasi hindi naman pwede na puro justification, excuses, and apologies nalang ang ibibigay nila sa client nila pag hindi na execute kasi bayad sila eh. She knows what she did, kaya kahit picture nung gawa nila wala siya. I tried asking, pero wala daw. Usually proud yang mga yan, ipopost nila for promotion, pero ni isa wala. Isn’t that an indicator na alam niya she underdelivered? 

And then kanina, I left a review sa Facebook page niya of what transpired ++ proof, and it gained traction. A few hours later, she was calling me and asking na we settle it daw privately. I no longer have the urge to settle dahil unang una kahit i-refund niya ako, tapos na yung araw! Moot and academic na. Useless na kasi hindi naman ako para magpakasal ulit. Also, alam ko naman na kahit i-refund niya, that comes with a condition -- to take down ng review and posts sa wedding fb groups, na hindi ko gagawin dahil deserve niya yon. Lol.

The retreat center, where I’ve been living and licking my wounds, is over an hour away from where my ex and our son live. So I have to leave before my mother starts the sacred morning coffee service at 7:30. (Non-negotiable. The woman runs a tight spiritual kitchen.)

We’ve been working out a new co-parenting rhythm. When she first asked me to start picking him up at 6:30 AM, I thought it was ridiculous. A subtle form of punishment wrapped in early wake-ups and existential dread.

But I was wrong.

It’s not punishment. It’s a gift.

If I time it right, I get there before he wakes up. I sit by his crib and just listen to him breathe. Sometimes he stirs and sees me, half-asleep, and smiles. Sometimes he lifts his arms so I’ll pick him up and he can fall back asleep in my arms.

Those mornings—those few quiet, unfiltered moments—are saving me.

The mornings don’t last long enough. And I hate daycare drop-offs. I’m not here to argue with anyone about childcare, but for my son, it just feels too early. Too soon to be in systems and schedules when what he really needs is presence and peace.

And the truth is, it’s my fault he’s there.

He’s in daycare because I made selfish choices. Because I stayed in a failing business instead of staying home. Because I avoided hard conversations. Because I didn’t protect the life we were trying to build.

Now I wake up at 5 AM not because I’m a guru, but because I’m a man trying to earn back something sacred.

Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.

WITH 120,000 people in Northern Ireland unaware they are living with high blood pressure, NI Chest Heart & Stroke has shared advice on how to use monitors, lifestyle and keeping on top of medication.

Fidelma Carter is head of Public Health at NICHS.

She explains that while blood pressure naturally fluctuates throughout the day, it is important to see your doctor if it is consistently high,

“Untreated high blood pressure can increase the risk of severe conditions, including heart failure, heart attacks, and strokes, but can also affect your brain, kidneys, and eyes,” she said.

# Understanding Blood Pressure Numbers

Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury or mmHg, with the ideal healthy range between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg.

It is considered high when it rises to 140/90mmHg or more, while it is low at 90/60mmHg or lower.

One reading alone is not enough to confirm a problem, and it must be recorded over a period of time.

# Are there any symptoms associated with high blood pressure?

Known as ‘the silent killer,’ high blood pressure rarely has any physical symptoms and is often only discovered after a stroke or a heart attack.

The only way to confirm your blood pressure is to measure it.

# Does blood pressure mainly affect older people?

“Many people associate high blood pressure with older people, but high blood pressure can affect anyone, at any age,” Ms Carter said.

“It is important people are not complacent about their health just because they are in a younger age bracket.”

# How can you get your blood pressure checked?

Checking your blood pressure takes only minutes, and can be done with an appointment at your local GP surgery or pharmacy.

You can also buy blood pressure machine for home monitoring (it is best to buy one that measures from the upper arm rather than from finger tips), while some workplaces provide health checks for their staff.

If diagnosed with high blood pressure, it also advised to have your blood cholesterol checked as this can also increase the risks of heart disease and stroke.

# What can people do to reduce their risk?

While high blood pressure dramatically increases the risk of heart attack or stroke, Ms Carter said “the good news” is that is also one of the most preventable causes of these conditions.

“There are many lifestyle changes we can all make to help reduce our blood pressure and maintain it at a healthy level,” she said.

“These changes include maintaining a healthy weight, taking regular exercise and being more active, reducing salt intake, stopping smoking, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, and cutting back on the amount of alcohol we drink.

“These changes might sound simple, but they really could help save your life.”

# Diet and blood pressure

Vanessa McMinn is a public health dietician with the Southern Trust.

She advises adults to have no more than 6g of salt a day, the equivalent of one teaspoon - as the sodium in salt contributes to high blood pressure.

Tips include not having the saltshaker on the dinner table at all, and instead using herbs and spices to flavour your food when cooking.

Reducing the number of ready meals and takeaways, crisps and salted nuts as well as having less cured, smoked and processed meats and fish all help.

Comparing food labels also allows you to choose the products with the least salt.

Excessive alcohol can damage the heart muscle and lead to high blood pressure, so limiting alcohol to 14 units a week is advised.

Vanessa McMinn, SHSCT Public Health Dietitian.

A healthy diet to lower blood pressure includes foods that are high in potassium, magnesium, calcium and fibre.

Practical ways to fit in five portions of fruit and vegetables a day include swapping biscuits for fruit as snacks and blending cooked vegetables to make sauces and bulk out curry and pasta dishes.

>— Northern Ireland Chest Heart & Stroke (@nichstweet) [May 10, 2025](https://twitter.com/nichstweet/status/1921264226120642705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Dairy foods are a valuable source of calcium, with Ms McMinn recommending lower fat versions of yoghurts and cheese.

Wholegrain breakfast cereals and breads, brown pasta and rice are all high in fibre, potassium and magnesium

A portion of protein with each meal is good for muscle strength with two or more portions of fish per week recommended.

While multiple cups of coffee and cola drinks are easy to reach for to get through a busy week, it is recommended to moderate intake.

Keeping physically active helps to lose weight and keep your heart and blood vessels in good condition.

A goal of 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity activity is recommended, which means any activity that makes you feel warmer, breathe harder and makes your heart beat faster than usual.

If in doubt, it is recommended to consult your doctor before increasing your weekly exercise.

Another major issue is stress, as this can lead to unhealthy habits like eating and drinking too much as well as avoiding exercise which can lead to long term high blood pressure.

 Ms McMinn advises getting enough sleep, learning relaxation techniques or asking for help to manage stress.

# Medication

Cliff McElhinney from Urban Pharmacy in Belfast has been a community pharmacist for 35 years.

“It is very important to take your medicine as directed and you may need two or more types of blood pressure medication to effectively treat your high blood pressure,” he said.

“The medicine will not necessarily make you feel any different, but this does not mean it is not working. If you miss doses, your medication will not work as well.”

Cliff McElhinney from Urban Pharmacy in Belfast.

Mr McElhinney says it is important to take medication at the same time each day, whenever is most convenient, so it becomes part of your routine.

While medication can cause side effects, he said this is usually not the case for those taking blood pressure medication.

For those that do, he recommends talking to their GP to look at changing your dose or finding an alternative medication that works best for them.

He said it is crucial not to stop taking medication without consulting your doctor first.

“You may need to take blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life,” he said.

“However, if you make healthy lifestyle changes to help reduce your blood pressure, your doctor might be able to reduce or stop your treatment if your blood pressure stays under control for several years.”

Tips to remember to take your medication include pill boxes marked with the day and time (which are available from your pharmacy), setting an alarm on your phone and post-it notes stuck on places you will notice them.

While medication helps, it does not mean you can ignore the need for a healthy lifestyle.

For those on medication, Mr McElhinney recommends a blood pressure check at least once a year with your GP or pharmacist to ensure your medication is still working effectively.

The way it started out was so boring. I’ll be honest and say I didn’t really buy the idea of the audience liking the Brandy recast. But, as the episode went on it just started to suck me in.

Once the coffee was spilt and shit hit the fan it became very compelling. I thought that was such a brilliant and unexpected turn of events. Them being stuck together so long and falling deeply in love.

Seeing Brandy’s character be absolutely heartbroken while being in love with a completely different version of Clara while knowing their time was coming to an end really pulled at the heart strings. I actually almost teared up at the movie’s ending scene. It really resonated with me and I’m not even entirely sure why.

I think maybe it’s because of Brandy’s conversation with her agent early in the episode where she said she felt as if she was missing something. Then she finally found someone that made her feel something only to have it taken away so suddenly on top of the fact that she was in love with an AI.

A major thing I didn’t like is that Brandy didn’t explain to Kimmy what she had just went through once her voice came back. I would have been irate! Like, “hello, it’s been literal fucking days in this hotel!” She just kind of went on with the instruction. Maybe she was in shock, idk.

Overall, this episode went from being one I thought would be the absolute worst to being my second favorite (plaything).",3,1747043908.0,blackmirror,2,1.0,False

I'm on day 5 of taking bupropion now and, while my doctor didn't mention anything about it skyrocketing anxiety (or I guess keeping the body in an almost constant fight/flight), I definitely understand why he asked a lot of questions about my anxiety-history 😅 I constantly feel like I'm running on 30 cups of coffee. But while it isn't exactly pleasant, I've also found myself able to use this anxious energy to do things I wasn't able to before.

I'm guessing what I'm worried about is that I'll lose momentum again when my body has gotten used to the extra chemicals, but on the other hand also that it'll forever be this kind of unpleasant anxious energy 🫠

We started high school in September and are in the same class. We have a friend group of people from our school which we used to hang out with everyday but now not so much. I have recently found out the reason they dont invite us as much is because they have noticed mv bsf has changed a lot since the beginning of the year. Tbh I have noticed it too, shes become a bit obsessed with becoming popular and blending in, but the thing that bothers everyone the most is that you kinda have to watch your mouth around her. I personally dont have to because I know I can trust her with everything but in the last few months she has spread several secrets that were told to us in confidence by our friends so i understand where they are coming from. The problem is that they have been inviting me to go out with them and have added me to their groupchat and i want to hang out with them because they are still my friends and i have known some of them for years but i just feel uncomfortable going without my bsf because i dont want to hurt her. I mean a couple days ago she got mad at me because i went for coffee with one of our guy friends, it wasnt a group thing or anything it was just the two of us and she got mad at me for not inviting her. She is my bsf and i love hanging out with her but i just think that its normal that we hang out with other people sometimes. I mean we have one mutual friend that were both really good friends with and they hang out without me all the time and i never get mad because i understand she wants to hang out with other people so i just dont think its fair for her to get mad at me.

1kkogau,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kkogau/aitah_for_buying_myself_flowers_for_mothers_day/,AITAH for buying myself flowers for Mother's Day?,"My husband (M47) and I (F38) have been married for 15 years. We have two boys who are 14 and 6. I'm disabled and a SAHM and I run 90% of the household, including the care of our youngest who has special needs. Until last year when I had a minor breakdown, I also did all the administrative work for my husband's business.

My husband has never been great at the whole special days things that mean a lot to me. I don't need anything expensive, just an acknowledgement. Something that shows me that he thinks of me, appreciates me, and loves me.

I've talked to him about it many times, told him that these things are important to me, and then he makes an effort for a few holidays before we're back to the same thing where he either forgets entirely or gives me something with no real thought behind it.

As an example, I gave him a new phone for Christmas because the front-facing camera in his old one was busted and I would like to see him clearly so we could connect better when he travels for work, which he does often. He gave me a set of cutting boards.

Anyway, I wasn't having a lot of hopes for Mother's Day. Our eldest wasn't home. I think he would've said sometging. But no one said anything in the morning. No one said anything at noon. Nothing all day. 

At the end of the afternoon, I'd had enough of waiting. I went and bought myself a nice bouquet of flowers. It was beautiful and it made me happy.

When my husband saw them he was pissed. He said that he wanted to get flowers when he was going grocery shopping. He oscillated between being short-tempered with both me and the kids, and just giving me the silent treatment for the rest of the evening, and locked himself in the bedroom after dinner.

Later at night we had an argument where he said that he couldn't do anything for special days if I just did it myself before he got the chance. I said he'd had the chance all day, but he forgot. 

He insisted he didn't forget, and I said that that would be worse because that meant he intentionally let me be sad all day. Thinking he'd forgotten was me giving him the benefit of the doubt. Then he said I should have reminded him, but I said it's not the same. Then he said I want too much and he's too busy to do those things and I'm being a drama queen.

It's not that I need expensive flowers, but I want to feel seen. I want to feel appreciated. I would have been happy with a cup of coffee if it came with a Happy Mother's Day. I would have been overjoyed if he'd facilitated something for the boys to do for me. A cake, a drawing, anything really.

I'm tired of begging for his attention and his love, so I decided to show myself some love. But now I'm having second thoughts because maybe it was too dramatic and I'm acting too entitled.

There's also the endangerment of my child and the public with the fact my daughter was expelled from school after bringing razor blades to school and a gun threat. That came after her mother told her all the school shootings are done by transgender kids.

**What’s the “Larry Goins – Filthy Riches Course” All About?**

If you’ve ever thought real estate investing was only for folks with deep pockets, perfect credit, or years of experience—think again. The **Larry Goins – Filthy Riches Course** flips that idea on its head. This course is all about buying super cheap houses—like under $5,000 cheap—and flipping them creatively for serious profit. It’s based on a simple concept: you can make more money on a $5K house nobody wants than what most investors make on a $100K property. And it’s not just theory—it’s got a repeatable process to back it up.

**Who’s It For? (Hint: Probably You)**

Whether you're brand new to real estate or just tired of being stuck in the rat race of high-cost, high-competition deals, **Larry Goins – Filthy Riches Course** might be exactly what you need. It’s built for the everyday person: no fancy suits, no deep knowledge of mortgage laws, and definitely no need for piles of cash or great credit. If you’ve got a laptop and a few hours a week, you’re good to go.

**Why This Course Stands Out (Not Your Average Real Estate Training)**

This ain’t your typical overpriced coaching program with endless theory and zero direction. What makes the **Larry Goins – Filthy Riches Course** unique is how *simple* and *actionable* it is. The entire strategy is laid out in a seven-step system that you can follow right away—even while sipping your morning coffee or chilling at the beach. No banks, no buyers list, no nonsense. Just cheap houses, seller financing, and smart flipping techniques that work even in today’s market.

**Where Does It Work? (Spoiler: Anywhere You Are)**

This strategy is 100% remote-friendly. You can do it in your own state, out-of-state, or even while traveling. That’s the beauty of using seller financing and note selling instead of relying on traditional flips or bank loans. You’re not tied to your zip code or stuck chasing deals in saturated markets. The **Larry Goins – Filthy Riches Course** shows you how to find overlooked gems in parts of the country other investors are ignoring.

**When Should You Start? (Right Freakin’ Now)**

This isn’t a ""someday"" kind of opportunity—it’s a *get-started-immediately* system. Larry teaches a method that doesn’t require a learning curve of months. You could be putting it into practice within a week and closing deals within 30 days. It’s perfect for side hustlers or full-timers who just want fast traction.

**How Does It Actually Work?**

Instead of rehabbing properties or selling to traditional buyers, the course teaches you to acquire cheap houses and *seller finance* them. That means you sell the property to someone who pays you in monthly installments—no banks involved. Want quick cash? You can also flip those notes to investors and cash out. The course provides a detailed step-by-step plan, plus resources to help you find, fund, and flip deals with ease.

**Final Thoughts – Is It Legit?**

Absolutely. The **Larry Goins – Filthy Riches Course** isn’t just another overhyped real estate course. It’s down-to-earth, actionable, and focused on a niche that *actually* has low competition. Larry even puts his money where his mouth is—offering funding for your first deal and buying deals from students. If you’re looking for a smarter, leaner way to get into real estate without the usual headaches, this course is the real deal.",1,1747042023.0,VosiLearning,1,1.0,False

I’ve been living in Switzerland for a while now, and while I love the order and calm, sometimes I really miss the magic of spontaneous meetups—bumping into someone for a random coffee, joining an unplanned walk, or just finding folks nearby up for something casual and fun.

It feels like everything here has to be planned days (or weeks!) in advance, which can make social life a bit... rigid. I’m curious—does anyone else feel this way?

If there were an easy, no-pressure way to connect with people nearby for simple, spontaneous moments—nothing romantic, just human—would that be something you'd use? Or is this just one of those cultural things we learn to accept?

1kknzzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BicycleArea/comments/1kknzzg/spotlight_the_senada_electric_bike_1000w_fat_tire/,Spotlight the SENADA Electric Bike 1000W Fat Tire Review for Adventurous Riders,"Stretching my legs on the SENADA ARCHON-PRO-BB electric bike, I quickly realized it isn’t just a mode of transportation, but an adventure-packed companion for enthusiasts. Tackling both trails and city streets, this versatile e-bike offers an intriguing mix of power, performance, and comfort. With a sturdy aluminum frame and a 1000W motor, it promises speed and resilience for countless rides. After weeks of testing, here's my detailed breakdown—from its strongest attributes to areas that might leave potential users scratching their heads.

**Design and Build of the Electric Bike**  
The first thing that really stood out to me was the durability of the aluminum frame. Weighing in at around 67 pounds without the battery, you might think it would feel heavy, but its weight contributes to an impressively stable ride. The sleek black-and-blue design is clean and sporty, making it equally suitable for casual city commutes or more rugged terrain. I personally appreciated the 26""x4"" fat tires, which provided excellent grip across gravel paths, snow patches, and even some wet forest trails during my weekend rides.

**Performance Unleashed With Its 1000W Motor**  
From the moment I powered it on, the heart of this e-bike—the 1000W brushless motor—delivered an extra punch. During flat city rides, I was able to reach speeds close to 30 mph in no time. It wasn’t just the speed that impressed me, but the torque as well. Climbing hills with minimal effort felt like cheating (in the best way possible), and rough terrains such as loose sand posed no problem whatsoever. The power output is consistent, yet smooth, which made every level of pedal assist feel seamless.

**Check SENADA ARCHON-PRO-BB pricing on Amazon [here](https://bicyclearea.com/p/b0bsfcfxj3/).**

**Battery: Long Rides Without Constant Charging**  
Equipped with a removable 48V 17.5Ah lithium-ion battery, the bike averaged between 40 and 60 miles per charge based on how aggressive I went with speed. Longer weekend trails didn’t give me much anxiety, especially since recharging was as easy as bringing the battery indoors. Given the convenience of a removable mechanism, there were no concerns about theft during stops for coffee or snacks. However, optimizing the battery meant consistently using pedal-assist rather than relying solely on the throttle.

**Thoughtful Features And Safety In Mind**  
Diving into its other features, the LCD intelligent display was a big help showing real-time data like speed, battery life, and mileage. There’s something about knowing exactly how much battery juice you’ve got left while on steep trails. Moreover, the 21-speed gear-shifting system was smooth, enabling quick transitions during hilly climbs or when speeding along a flat path. Another standout was its front suspension fork, which absorbed shocks with ease; bumpy trails felt manageable even for someone prone to rattling nerves.

Adding to its stellar safety features, the mechanical disc brakes were reliable regardless of weather conditions. Whether it was drizzling or dry, braking felt sharp yet controlled. A moment biking along a twisty downhill made me appreciate just how essential a dependable braking system can be.

**Advantages**  
- Powerful 1000W motor for impressive speeds and torque.  
- Long-lasting removable battery for extended range and easy charging.  
- 26""x4"" fat tires providing solid grip across various terrains.  
- Lightweight, sturdy frame combining durability and elegance.  
- User-friendly LCD display and multiple gear-shifting options.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Heavier than many competitors, which can make manual handling a task.  
- Assembly, though 95% prepped, may take longer for less experienced users.  
- Battery charging, while convenient, could benefit from shorter recharge times.  

**Industry Competitors**  
Compared to models like the Ecotric Fat Tire Electric Bike, the design of this e-bike stands out as being more robust while still embracing an adventurous spirit. Unlike the popular RadRover 6 Plus, which has gained traction with its all-weather brakes, the SENADA ARCHON-PRO-BB beats it in terms of raw speed and motor wattage. However, in terms of a lightweight option, Aventon Aventure frames might appeal more to those strictly prioritizing portability. That said, the inclusion of features like a long-range battery and advanced pedal-assist modes keeps the SENADA bike ahead of many of its price-equivalent alternatives.

**Price Worthiness**  
When you weigh its features—like the powerful motor, reliable safety gears, and high-capacity battery—the price point feels justified for someone leaning toward functionality and performance. While it’s not the cheapest option in the market, you’re undoubtedly receiving an electric bike that can bridge city commuting and off-road adventuring effortlessly. It’s really more a question of whether you’ll fully utilize its capabilities. As someone who indulges in weekend biking while needing a reliable daily urban commuter, I’d confidently argue it provides solid value. Those looking to save more may sacrifice the power or battery upgrade.

We chatted for a bit, and he suggests this hip coffee shop actually just down the street from me. So, naturally, I'm all in for a cozy coffee date.

Fast forward to Saturday, I'm at the coffee shop, on time, feeling low-key cute in my casual 'I'm-put-together-but-not-really-trying' look. I'm a few sips into my latte when my phone starts buzzing with texts from him. Just random chit-chat stuff... until he drops the, ""So where are you?""

Cue my confused blink like 🤔... ""I'm at the coffee shop, you?"" Turns out, when he proposed the coffee shop date, he meant the one near his place, not mine. 🤦‍♀️ Who even knew we lived miles apart, with two of the same-named coffee joints in between?!

In the end, we both had a good laugh about it over texts and promised to meet halfway next time (tbh, I'm kinda glad I got to keep my cute spot in the window with a good book!).

Liora had been babbling all day—soft murmurs, tiny sounds, as though her little lips were testing every syllable the world had to offer. Vickey had been patient, her heart swelling each time a sound escaped her daughter’s mouth. But nothing yet had formed a clear word. Until now.

Suddenly, Liora’s chubby hand reached toward the door.

Her wide violet eyes sparkled.

“Pa… pa…”

Vickey blinked. Her breath hitched. “Liora?”

Then, the doors creaked open.

Lucifer stepped in—his scarlet wings stretching slightly behind him, the feathers catching the firelight like rubies. His coat was slung over one shoulder, the top buttons of his shirt undone, hair slightly tousled from the warm wind outside. He looked relaxed, if a little tired, from a day of council meetings and royal duties.

Liora lit up like a spark-catching fire.

A high, excited squeal broke from her lips as she bounced in Vickey’s arms. She pointed with both tiny hands.

“My papa is here!” she exclaimed, the words laced with joy and wonder. “Papa, comes back!”

Lucifer froze.

For a heartbeat, he didn’t move. His crimson eyes widened. 

He was across the room in seconds, dropping to his knees before her.

“You… you said—” His voice cracked as he reached for her, his large hands trembling slightly. “Say it again, little flame.”

Liora giggled, her tiny hands patting his face. “Papa! My papa!”

Lucifer’s throat worked around the emotion swelling in his chest. He scooped her into his arms, holding her against him like she was more precious than any kingdom he’d ever ruled.

“I’m here, little star,” he whispered, pressing his lips to her temple. “Papa always comes back.”

Vickey watched silently, tears in her eyes and a smile on her lips. At that moment, the PAtnce of Hell was not a ruler or a symbol of power—he was just a father, utterly in awe of the little miracle who had just called him home with a single word.

Scene: That Night – A Quiet Confession

The palace had grown quiet. Liora was fast asleep in her cradle, curled up beneath a soft blanket of silken threads spun from light and warmth. A peaceful hush lingered in the air, broken only by the low crackle of the fire in the hearth.

Lucifer stood at the window, bathed in the glow of the twin moons that hung over Hell’s sky like watchful eyes. His scarlet wings were relaxed, half-draped over his back. His shirt was off now, and he held a cup of coffee in one hand—but he hadn’t touched it.

Vickey came up behind him, wrapping her arms around his waist from behind. She rested her cheek against his back, breathing him in—warm, familiar, steady.

“She really surprised you today,” she murmured.

Lucifer’s voice was quiet, almost distant. “She shattered me, Vickey.”

He turned slowly in her arms, setting the glass aside. His hands found her waist as his gaze searched hers—not the burning, confident stare the world knew, but something softer. Vulnerable.

“I’ve ruled hell. Commanded legions. I’ve heard my name spoken in fear and fury.” He paused, swallowing. “But today… when she looked at me with those eyes—and called me ‘papa’…”

His voice broke slightly, and he lowered his forehead to hers.

“I never thought a word could undo me like that. It wasn’t just a sound. It was trust. Belonging. Love. Real, pure love.”

Vickey cupped his cheek gently. “Because you are her papa. The one she waits for, the one she runs to.”

Lucifer let out a shaky breath and pulled her into a tight embrace, pressing her to his chest.

“I never had that. Not from my father. Not like this.” He kissed her forehead. “But now… I have you. And her. And I swear, Vickey, I will never leave either of you waiting too long again.”

Vickey smiled into his chest, her hand resting over his heart. “We never doubted you’d come back.”

He chuckled softly, his voice warm. “Still… hearing it from her lips made something settle inside me. Like the world finally gave me the one title I never knew I needed.”

He leaned down and kissed her—slow and deep—then pulled her toward the hearth.

“Come. Sit with me. Let’s watch the fire and pretend the world is only as big as this room.”

And they did. Wrapped in each other’s arms, with the flicker of fire painting them in gold, and their daughter’s first words still echoing gently in their hearts.

1kknwt3,https://youtu.be/Td2CoMobg1E,4 Very Scary TRUE Spring Crime Horror Stories,"**""Eyes in April"":**

I never thought I’d live through something so terrifying. I’m just a regular 22-year-old, working part-time at a bookstore in a small New England town. Last spring, my peaceful life turned into a chilling ordeal that still makes my skin crawl.It started in early April. I was heading home from work, taking my usual shortcut through the town’s community garden. The place was lively with people tending to plants or chatting on benches. As I walked, I noticed a man standing near a flowerbed, staring at me. He was in his late thirties, with a scruffy beard and a dark cap pulled low. His gaze felt heavy, but I brushed it off and kept going.The next day, he was there again, leaning against a tree, watching me. I felt a knot in my stomach but told myself it was nothing. By the third day, when I saw him in the same spot, my unease grew. I decided to avoid the garden, taking a longer route home. But then I started seeing him elsewhere—outside the bookstore, at the bus stop, even near my apartment complex. He never spoke, just stared with those unblinking eyes.I confided in my coworker, Lisa, during a slow shift. We were restocking shelves, the smell of old books around us. “Lisa, there’s this guy,” I said, keeping my voice low. “I keep seeing him everywhere, and it’s freaking me out.”Lisa stopped shelving and turned to me. “Everywhere? Like, following you?”“I think so,” I said, fidgeting with a bookmark. “He just stares. It’s creepy.”“That’s not okay,” Lisa said, her brows furrowing. “You need to tell someone. Maybe the police?”“I don’t know,” I said. “He hasn’t done anything. What if I’m being paranoid?”“Trust your instincts,” Lisa said firmly. “This sounds bad.”I didn’t go to the police right away. I was scared of making a fuss over nothing. But a few days later, something happened that changed everything. When I got home, I found a small envelope slipped under my apartment door. Inside was a handwritten note: “You look nice today.” I’d worn a new scarf that day. My hands shook as I read it, realizing he’d been close enough to see me.I called Lisa immediately. “There’s a note,” I said, my voice trembling. “It’s him, Lisa. He knows where I live.”“That’s it,” Lisa said. “You’re not staying there tonight. Come to my place, and we’re calling the cops.”I grabbed a bag and went to Lisa’s. That night, we sat on her couch, and I showed the note to Officer Patel, a calm man with a notepad. “This is concerning,” he said, sliding the note into an evidence bag. “Do you know who this man is?”“No,” I said, hugging a pillow. “I just see him all the time.”“We’ll investigate,” Patel said. “For now, stay with your friend and consider a security camera.”I stayed with Lisa, but the fear didn’t go away. A week later, we came back from grabbing coffee and found another note taped to her apartment door. It read, “I miss seeing you.” My knees buckled, and Lisa caught me before I hit the floor.“We’re done with this,” Lisa said, her voice shaking with anger. “This guy’s unhinged.”We called Officer Patel again. He came over, took the note, and promised to increase patrols. But they still had no solid leads—no fingerprints, no clear description beyond my vague one. I felt trapped, like this man was a shadow I couldn’t escape.Lisa’s neighbor, Tom, a burly guy who worked construction, overheard us talking and stepped in. “You need to catch this creep,” he said, leaning against Lisa’s kitchen counter. “What if you go back to your routine, and I keep an eye out? I’ll stay out of sight.”“That’s dangerous,” I said, my heart racing. “What if he does something?”“I’ll have backup,” Tom said. “My buddy’s a security guard. We’ll make sure you’re safe.”I was terrified, but I couldn’t keep living like this. So, I agreed. The next day, I walked to work, my palms sweaty, knowing Tom and his friend were nearby. The street felt too quiet, every sound making me jump. Halfway to the bookstore, I saw him—the man, standing across the street, watching me. My breath caught, but I kept walking, trusting Tom’s plan.Then I heard shouts. Tom and his friend were crossing the street, confronting the man. “Hey, you!” Tom yelled. “Why you following her?”The man’s face went white. “I—I wasn’t,” he stammered, stepping back.“Don’t lie,” Tom said, blocking his path. “We’ve seen you.”A police car pulled up, alerted by Tom’s friend. The officers took the man in for questioning. Later, Officer Patel called me. “His name’s Mark Evans,” he said. “He’s got a record—stalking, harassment. We found notes and photos of you in his apartment. He’s not going anywhere for a while.”I felt a rush of relief, but also dread. “Photos?” I asked. “How long was he watching me?”“Months,” Patel said. “He worked maintenance at your apartment complex last year. That’s how he knew your place.”Evans was charged with stalking and trespassing. I got a restraining order and moved to a new apartment with better locks. Lisa and Tom still check on me, and I’ve got a security camera now. But I’m not the same. I avoid shortcuts, check behind me constantly, and sleep with a light on.This spring taught me how fast someone can invade your life. I ignored the signs at first, thinking I was overreacting. If you feel watched, don’t wait. Speak up. It might save you from a nightmare like mine.





**""Vanished in Spring"":**

I was sitting in my apartment, folding clothes, when my phone rang. It was March 31, 2006, and Brian, my boyfriend, was out with friends to kick off spring break. We were supposed to leave for Florida the next morning. His voice came through, loud and happy, over the bar noise. “Hey, I’m at the Ugly Tuna with Clint and Meredith. Having a good time. I’ll be home soon, okay?”“Don’t stay out too late,” I said, smiling. “We’ve got a flight at 7 a.m.”“I know, I know,” he laughed. “Love you.”“Love you too,” I said, and hung up. That was the last time we talked.Morning came, and Brian wasn’t there. I called him, but it went straight to voicemail. My stomach twisted. I tried again. Nothing. I called Clint, his friend from the bar. “Hey, have you seen Brian?” I asked.“Not since last night,” Clint said. “We left the bar around 2 a.m. He was still there, talking to some girls.”“What do you mean, still there?” I asked, my voice shaking.“He said he was gonna stay a bit. I thought he’d head home after,” Clint said. “You okay?”“No, I’m not,” I snapped, hanging up. I drove to Brian’s apartment. His car was parked outside, but he wasn’t inside. His bed was made, dishes clean, backpack on the chair. It was like he’d never come back.I called his dad, Randy. “Something’s wrong,” I said. “Brian’s gone.”“Gone? What do you mean?” Randy’s voice cracked.“He didn’t come home. His stuff’s here, but he’s not,” I said. We agreed to meet at the police station. The officer we spoke to was calm, too calm. “He’s an adult,” he said. “Maybe he’s just out. We’ll look into it if he’s not back in a couple days.”“He’s not like that,” I said. “He wouldn’t just disappear.”Randy nodded. “Please, check now. He’s a good kid.”They took our statement and said they’d pull security footage from the bar. A few days later, they called us in. The detective played the video. There was Brian, tall, wearing his green shirt, laughing outside the Ugly Tuna at 1:55 a.m. with two women. He waved, stepped off-screen, and that was it. He didn’t come back into view. The bar had one main entrance, cameras on it. No one saw him leave.“How does that happen?” I asked, my hands trembling. “Where did he go?”“We don’t know,” the detective said. “We’re talking to everyone who was there. No leads yet.”Randy leaned forward. “What about the girls he was with?”“They said he seemed fine, said he was going back inside,” the detective said. “That’s all we’ve got.”We didn’t wait for the police. Randy and I organized searches. We walked through campus, checked alleys, handed out flyers with Brian’s picture. One night, I stood outside the bar, staring at the spot where he was last seen. “Brian!” I yelled. “Brian, please!” My voice echoed, but no one answered.A week later, a cop called. “We found a jacket by the Olentangy River,” he said. “Matches what Brian might’ve worn.”“Is it his?” I asked, hopeful.“We’re testing it,” he said. Days later, they confirmed it wasn’t. My heart sank. Every lead felt like a dead end.Months passed. I went through Brian’s apartment, hoping for clues. In his drawer, I found a small box with a ring inside. My breath caught. Was he going to propose in Florida? I sat on his bed, holding it, tears falling. I couldn’t let go.People had theories. Some said he ran away, started a new life. Others thought he was hurt, taken. But Brian wouldn’t leave. Not with his mom gone just weeks before, not with his family, not with me. Still, no one found anything. No body, no trace.Years later, in 2019, someone sent a photo of a man in Mexico who looked like Brian. My hopes spiked, but DNA tests said it wasn’t him. Every time I thought we were close, the truth slipped away.Now, it’s been almost 20 years. I’ve built a life, but Brian’s absence is a shadow. Every spring, I think of that night, that call, his laugh. We still hold vigils, light candles, share memories. Randy’s gone now, but I keep hoping. Maybe one day, someone will know something. Until then, I’m stuck, haunted by the question: where is he?







**“Eyes at the Window.”:**

I was eight years old, curled up in my bed, the covers pulled tight. My little brother was asleep in the next room, his soft snores drifting through the wall. Dad was working late again, some big job that kept him away most nights, so it was just Mom, my brother, and me in our quiet house. I couldn’t sleep. The house felt too still, like it was holding its breath. Then I heard it—a faint creak outside, like someone stepping on the porch.I slipped out of bed, my socks silent on the carpet, and crept to the living room. Mom was at the kitchen table, paying bills, a single lamp casting long shadows. She looked up, her eyes narrowing when she saw me.“Honey, what’s wrong?” she asked, her voice low.“I heard something,” I said, pointing toward the front door. “On the porch.”Her face changed, like she’d been slapped. She stood, moving to the window, and peeked through the curtains. Her hand froze on the fabric. “Go to your brother’s room,” she whispered. “Stay there.”“Mom, what is it?” I asked, my stomach twisting.“Now,” she said, her voice sharp. I ran down the hall, my heart thumping, and slipped into my brother’s room. He was still asleep, his toy truck clutched in one hand. I locked the door and hid behind his bed, the carpet rough under my knees.Then came a knock at the front door, slow and heavy. “Hey, it’s me,” a man’s voice called, deep and too calm. “Open the door.”I didn’t know that voice, but it made my skin crawl, like he was smiling as he spoke. The knocking got louder, and I heard Mom’s footsteps, quick and uneven. The phone beeped as she dialed.“Police, please,” she whispered. “There’s a man at my door. He’s trying to get in.”The man’s voice came again, closer, like he was at a side window. “Come on, I just want to talk.” His tone was harder now, like he was losing patience. I heard a faint scrape, like he was messing with the window lock. My brother stirred, mumbling in his sleep, and I pressed my hand over my mouth to stay quiet.“Mom?” I whispered, so soft I barely heard myself. No answer. The floor creaked under me, and I froze, terrified the man would hear. Dust tickled my nose, but I held my breath, afraid to sneeze.The knocking stopped. Silence pressed in, heavy and awful. I thought maybe he’d left, but then I heard a tap at my brother’s window, right above me. Tap. Tap. Tap. My chest hurt, and I curled tighter, my nails digging into my palms.“Ma’am, police are here,” a new voice shouted outside. Flashlights swept through the room, bouncing off the walls. I heard the man’s footsteps, fast and heavy, then a car engine roaring away. Police radios crackled, and someone knocked on the front door, firm but not scary.Mom opened my brother’s door, her face white as paper. “It’s okay, sweetie,” she said, pulling me out from behind the bed. Her hands were cold, shaking. “He’s gone.”“Who was that?” I asked, my voice wobbly.She didn’t answer, just hugged me tight. My brother woke up, rubbing his eyes, confused. The police came inside, their belts jingling. I sat on the couch, holding my brother’s hand, while Mom talked to an officer in the kitchen.“Do you know who it was?” the officer asked, his pen scratching on a notepad.“Yes,” Mom said, her voice barely steady. “He used to work with my husband. I recognized his voice… and those eyes, so blue, like ice. They had an argument a while back. I didn’t think he’d come here.”“Has he done this before?” the officer asked.“He’s called a few times,” Mom said. “Left messages, saying he wanted to check on us. I ignored them.”The officer nodded. “We’ll try to find him. Stay somewhere else tonight, just to be safe.”That night, Mom packed bags and drove us to Aunt Linda’s house, a small place with flowery curtains and a squeaky couch. Aunt Linda met us at the door, her face worried.“You okay?” she asked, hugging Mom.“No,” Mom said, setting my brother’s car seat down. “I keep seeing his face at the window.”“You’re safe here,” Aunt Linda said, but Mom kept checking the locks.A few days later, I saw him again. We were at a store near Aunt Linda’s, picking up milk. He was in the parking lot, leaning against a truck, staring at us. His blue eyes locked on mine, and he waved, slow and deliberate. I grabbed Mom’s arm.“Mom, it’s him,” I whispered, my voice shaking.She looked up, her face going pale. She pulled us back inside, telling the cashier to call security. By the time they checked, he was gone. Mom called the police again, but they didn’t find him.We stayed at Aunt Linda’s for weeks. Mom barely slept, always watching the windows. I kept my brother close, scared those eyes would appear again. When Dad finally came home, he was furious. I heard him talking to Mom one night, their voices low.“He’s been obsessed,” Dad said. “I should’ve known he’d try something.”“What do we do?” Mom asked. “He knows where we live.”“I’ll take care of it,” Dad said, his voice like steel. I don’t know what he did—maybe confronted him, maybe got the police to do more—but the man stopped coming around.We moved to a new house soon after, one with a tall fence and extra locks. Mom started to relax, but she always checked the doors at night. I’m older now, but that night still haunts me. The creak of the porch, the tap at the window, those icy blue eyes. I check my locks, too, because I learned some fears don’t need ghosts to keep you awake.





**“Lost on the Boardwalk”:**

I was 17, buzzing with excitement, standing in the crowded lobby of our Myrtle Beach hotel. Spring break 2009, and my best friend Brittanee and I had snuck away from our boring lives in New York to chase the sun and freedom. The air was thick with chatter, music blasting from somewhere, and the smell of sunscreen and pizza. Brittanee’s eyes sparkled as she tossed her dark hair, her flip-flops slapping against the tile.“This is it,” she said, grinning. “No parents, no rules. Just us and the beach.”I laughed, but my stomach twisted a little. “Just don’t do anything crazy, okay? Text me if you go anywhere.”She rolled her eyes. “Relax. I’m not a kid.”That night, the boardwalk was alive—neon lights flashing, crowds of teens shouting, the ocean roaring in the distance. We’d spent the day lounging by the pool, but now Brittanee was restless. She wore a bright green top and denim shorts, her phone tucked in her pocket. Around 8 p.m., she turned to me in our hotel room, where I was sprawled on the bed, scrolling through my phone.“Hey,” she said, grabbing her purse. “I’m gonna meet up with a friend at another hotel. It’s like a 10-minute walk.”I sat up, uneasy. “Alone? It’s dark out there.”“It’s fine,” she said, waving me off. “Tons of people are out. I’ll be back in an hour.”“Text me when you get there,” I said, my voice sharper than I meant.She smirked. “Yes, Mom.”I watched her leave, the door clicking shut. The room felt too quiet. I tried to shake the bad feeling, telling myself it was just nerves. Myrtle Beach was safe, right? Full of spring breakers like us. I waited for her text. Thirty minutes passed. Nothing. An hour. Still nothing. My fingers hovered over my phone, then I typed: “You there yet?”No reply.By 10 p.m., my chest was tight. I called her. Straight to voicemail. I paced the room, the carpet rough under my bare feet. Maybe her phone died. Maybe she was just having fun. But the boardwalk wasn’t that far, and she’d promised to text. I grabbed my sneakers and headed out, the hotel hallway buzzing with laughter from other rooms. The streets were still packed, but the crowds felt different now—too loud, too chaotic. I scanned every face, hoping to spot her green top. Nothing.I called another friend staying nearby. “Have you seen Brittanee?” I asked, my voice shaking.“Nope,” he said. “She was supposed to meet someone, right? Maybe she’s still there.”I walked faster, checking alleys, peering into bars. A guy in a hoodie stood near one, watching me. My skin prickled, and I hurried past, my heart pounding. By midnight, I was back at the hotel, calling her mom, Dawn, in New York.“Dawn, it’s me,” I said, barely holding it together. “Brittanee’s gone. She went to meet a friend and didn’t come back.”There was a long pause. “What do you mean, gone?” Her voice was sharp, scared.“I don’t know,” I said, tears burning my eyes. “She’s not answering her phone. I looked everywhere.”“I’m coming down there,” Dawn said. “Call the police. Now.”The police station was cold, the fluorescent lights harsh. An officer took my statement, his pen scratching as I described Brittanee’s clothes, her plans. “She’s probably just partying,” he said, but his eyes didn’t meet mine. I wanted to scream. Brittanee wasn’t like that. She’d text me. She’d come back.Dawn arrived the next day, her face pale, eyes red. We searched together, putting up flyers with Brittanee’s picture. The boardwalk, once so exciting, now felt like a trap—every corner hiding something dark. People stared at the flyers, then looked away. Days turned into weeks. Nothing. No calls, no sightings. Just grainy security footage from a hotel camera showing Brittanee walking alone, her green top bright against the night.“Do you think she’s okay?” I asked Dawn one night, sitting in her hotel room. My voice was small, like I was a kid again.Dawn clutched a flyer, her knuckles white. “I have to believe she is,” she said. “I can’t lose her.”But I saw the fear in her eyes, and it mirrored mine. I kept replaying that night, wondering if I should’ve gone with her, should’ve stopped her. The guilt ate at me, heavy and sharp.Years passed. The case went cold. I’d wake up at night, picturing Brittanee’s face, wondering where she was. Then, in 2016, a break—someone in prison said it was a homicide. My stomach dropped when I heard. Homicide. The word felt like a punch. But there was no body, no proof, just more questions.In 2022, I got a call from Dawn. “They found him,” she said, her voice trembling. “A man named Raymond Moody. He confessed.”I sat down hard, my legs weak. “Confessed to what?”“Everything,” she said. “He took her. Hurt her. Killed her.”Moody was 62, a drifter with a rap sheet. He’d seen Brittanee walking that night, lured her into his car. She never had a chance. He dumped her body in the woods, and it was gone by the time police searched. I felt sick, picturing her alone, scared. Moody pleaded guilty, got life in prison. Dawn fought for justice, even suing the hotel for not watching the cameras better. She won millions, but it didn’t bring Brittanee back.I still see her in my dreams, standing in that hotel lobby, laughing. I wish I’d grabbed her arm that night, told her to stay. The boardwalk’s neon lights don’t look bright anymore—they’re cold, flickering, hiding shadows I can’t unseen.",1,1747040718.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Some time ago my 4 years old machine started to show ""self diagnosis"" message. Does not react to buttons. I have another pump, so I replaced it, but nothing has changed.

I can run it in the test mode, and then I can hear grinder working, but screen is blank, and nothing more is happening, it also does not react on any buttons.

The backlight under ESC and OK labels is on all the time. 

I checked the heater resistance, and it gives around 30Ω, which according to internet, is a very good value.

It looks to me like electronics failure :( but I have not a lot of experience with coffee machines.

Is there anything I can test more?  Or should I give up and treat it as a parts storage?",1,1747040646.0,DeLonghi,0,1.0,False

1kknucw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kknucw,Gotta checkout the competition. It’s only fair. Jax burgers Westgate.,"So popped in after a work shift just before they closed. 
Was the only customer in the shop which allowed my food to be cooked in a quick timely manner. 
It’s not my first time but it is my first time giving a review.  

Went at the lower end with just a basic hamburger and large chips. 

The burger was full of flavour and had great salad presented on it.  Salad consisted of the usual lettuce, gherkins and I think tomato.  
Tomato sauce and Jax aioli as sauce. 
Bun was a light bread which  wasn’t too heavy at all and filling at all. 

Salad in the bun was crisp and fresh too. 

Onto the chips.  
The difference in the crunch and flavour of the chips due to them being fried in beef tallow is enormous. 
Crisp, crunchy and you can certainly taste the difference. 
Salt level was great but only because I asked for less salt on them. 

All in all Jax burgers sits high on my list of go tos  for a decent well priced burger.  
I spent just $19 and I’m certainly left feeling satisfied and happy.

1kkntxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/LucifersRealm/comments/1kkntxl/nothing_just_but_everything_5_th/,Nothing just but everything (5 th),"After several months.......
Liora had been babbling all day—soft murmurs, tiny sounds, as though her little lips were testing every syllable the world had to offer. Vickey had been patient, her heart swelling each time a sound escaped her daughter’s mouth. But nothing yet had formed a clear word. Until now.

Suddenly, Liora’s chubby hand reached toward the door.

Her wide violet eyes sparkled.

“Pa… pa…”

Vickey blinked. Her breath hitched. “Liora?”

Then, the doors creaked open.

Lucifer stepped in—his scarlet wings stretching slightly behind him, the feathers catching the firelight like rubies. His coat was slung over one shoulder, the top buttons of his shirt undone, hair slightly tousled from the warm wind outside. He looked relaxed, if a little tired, from a day of council meetings and royal duties.

Liora lit up like a spark-catching fire.

A high, excited squeal broke from her lips as she bounced in Vickey’s arms. She pointed with both tiny hands.

“My papa is here!” she exclaimed, the words laced with joy and wonder. “Papa, come back!”

Lucifer froze.

For a heartbeat, he didn’t move. His crimson eyes widened. 

He was across the room in seconds, dropping to his knees before her.

“You… you said—” His voice cracked as he reached for her, his large hands trembling slightly. “Say it again, little flame.”

Liora giggled, her tiny hands patting his face. “Papa! My papa!”

Lucifer’s throat worked around the emotion swelling in his chest. He scooped her into his arms, holding her against him like she was more precious than any kingdom he’d ever ruled.

“I’m here, little star,” he whispered, pressing his lips to her temple. “Papa always comes back.”

Vickey watched silently, tears in her eyes and a smile on her lips. At that moment, the PAtnce of Hell was not a ruler or a symbol of power—he was just a father, utterly in awe of the little miracle who had just called him home with a single word.

Scene: That Night – A Quiet Confession

The palace had grown quiet. Liora was fast asleep in her cradle, curled up beneath a soft blanket of silken threads spun from light and warmth. A peaceful hush lingered in the air, broken only by the low crackle of the fire in the hearth.

Lucifer stood at the window, bathed in the glow of the twin moons that hung over Hell’s sky like watchful eyes. His scarlet wings were relaxed, half-draped over his back. His shirt was off now, and he held a cup of coffee in one hand—but he hadn’t touched it.

Vickey came up behind him, wrapping her arms around his waist from behind. She rested her cheek against his back, breathing him in—warm, familiar, steady.

“She really surprised you today,” she murmured.

Lucifer’s voice was quiet, almost distant. “She shattered me, Vickey.”

He turned slowly in her arms, setting the glass aside. His hands found her waist as his gaze searched hers—not the burning, confident stare the world knew, but something softer. Vulnerable.

“I’ve ruled hell. Commanded legions. I’ve heard my name spoken in fear and fury.” He paused, swallowing. “But today… when she looked at me with those eyes—and called me ‘papa’…”

His voice broke slightly, and he lowered his forehead to hers.

“I never thought a word could undo me like that. It wasn’t just a sound. It was trust. Belonging. Love. Real, pure love.”

Vickey cupped his cheek gently. “Because you are her papa. The one she waits for, the one she runs to.”

Lucifer let out a shaky breath and pulled her into a tight embrace, pressing her to his chest.

“I never had that. Not from my father. Not like this.” He kissed her forehead. “But now… I have you. And her. And I swear, Vickey, I will never leave either of you waiting too long again.”

Vickey smiled into his chest, her hand resting over his heart. “We never doubted you’d come back.”

He chuckled softly, his voice warm. “Still… hearing it from her lips made something settle inside me. Like the world finally gave me the one title I never knew I needed.”

He leaned down and kissed her—slow and deep—then pulled her toward the hearth.

“Come. Sit with me. Let’s watch the fire and pretend the world is only as big as this room.”

And they did. Wrapped in each other’s arms, with the flicker of fire painting them in gold, and their daughter’s first words still echoing gently in their hearts.

1kknioe,https://www.reddit.com/r/IT4Research/comments/1kknioe/the_modern_epidemic_of_depression/,The Modern Epidemic of Depression,"# An Evolutionary and Neurological Perspective

Depression is often described as a disease of the modern world – a shadow that has fallen over our digital age. Rates of depression have soared globally in recent decades, touching people of all ages and backgrounds. But why are so many of us depressed? In trying to understand this puzzle, it helps to look at our history as a species and at how our brains are wired.

In truth, we humans are deeply social animals. Our minds evolved to keep us safe in tribes, families, and tight-knit communities. When those bonds break or weaken, our well-being can suffer dramatically.

In this article, we’ll explore why disconnection from others can trigger anxiety and despair, and how the brain may misinterpret these signals. We will look at depression through an evolutionary lens – why our ancestors needed each other – and through a neurological lens – how parts of the brain can get stuck in patterns of fear and sadness. Along the way, we will discuss the aspects of modern life that make depression more common today, from social fragmentation to life online. Importantly, we’ll also talk about solutions: how movement and real-world interactions can calm the brain, and what strategies individuals and societies can use to reduce mental suffering.

# Why Humans Need Each Other: The Social Brain

Imagine life in a small hunting-and-gathering tribe. You wake up before dawn, share food and tools with your neighbors, cooperate to hunt or gather, and rely on each other for warmth and protection from predators. Every action depends on the people around you. Such was human life for hundreds of thousands of years – and our brains have been built by that experience. Over millennia, natural selection favored mental and emotional traits that helped us bond with others.

We became extremely attuned to social cues and to each other’s emotions. Our brains literally evolved to reward being part of a group.

At the same time, being part of a group was literally a life-or-death matter. An ancient human who strayed alone from the group risked starving or being eaten by wild animals. Being accepted by the group meant safety, shared resources, and help. On the other hand, being excluded from the group could be catastrophic. In evolutionary terms, social disconnection was a major threat.

It’s no surprise, then, that our biology treats social isolation like a danger. The same parts of the brain that respond to injury or threat also respond to feelings of rejection or loneliness. In effect, being excluded literally “hurts” — the brain sends an alarm.

# The Price of Isolation: Loneliness as Biological Alarm

Fast-forward to today. Even though a careless comment on social media is unlikely to get you eaten by a lion, our brains can still react strongly to isolation or rejection. When we feel alone or cut off, our body can go into a kind of chronic low-level alarm state. Stress hormones like cortisol start circulating. Our heart rate might go up, and we might feel a nervous tension, similar to anxiety.

In short, social disconnection triggers an automatic “danger response” even if there’s no immediate physical threat. This biological alarm system is meant to spur us to action, to reconnect and solve the problem. But what happens if the alarm goes off and we can’t silence it? Imagine having a smoke detector in your house that goes off repeatedly with no obvious fire. It would drive anyone crazy after a while. The same can happen in the brain.

Persistent loneliness or social pain can keep the alarm circuit buzzing. Over time, the brain’s stress response can recalibrate in an unhealthy way. That chronic stress and fear can manifest as depression. It’s like the brain is stuck in a loop of worry and pain, waiting for a threat that never resolves. Instead of the quick, intense response to an immediate danger, the alarm stays gently ringing, day after day. We feel tired, flat, anxious, or sad. We might start to withdraw even more, as if trying to wait out the alarm, but that just intensifies the sense of isolation. In effect, isolation can train our brains to expect harm, turning every setback into evidence of danger.

# The Brain on Depression: Rumination and Detachment

At the center of all this is the brain, especially the parts that handle thinking and emotion. One key player is the **prefrontal cortex**, the thinking part behind our forehead. This area helps us plan, analyze, and think about ourselves.

In healthy brains, it works hand-in-hand with other regions, like the **amygdala** (which processes fear) and the **hippocampus** (which handles memory). Together, these networks help us feel safe and purposeful.

In depression, however, the prefrontal cortex can start to misfire. Instead of calmly assessing the world and regulating emotions, it might run on overdrive, worrying excessively about things that might go wrong. This is what we call **rumination**: a repetitive loop of negative thoughts that seems impossible to break. Picture it like a scratched record skipping the same sad line over and over. You might find yourself replaying mistakes or worrying about what the future will bring, even when there’s no real threat.

This mental rut is like a feedback loop. The more we ruminate, the more anxious and down we feel, and the more our brain’s fear circuits stay active. At the same time, the prefrontal cortex can detach from reality. Instead of engaging with the present moment or seeking connection, it pulls back, withdrawing into imagination or anxiety. Tasks that once seemed manageable—going to work, cooking a meal, even speaking to a friend—start to feel overwhelming or pointless. This detachment deepens the depression, creating a vicious cycle of isolation and despair.

Imagine a ship’s captain who grew up thinking his boat was about to sink at any sign of storm, so he steers away, refusing to sail in open waters. That distrust grows until he rarely even touches the wheel. The captain’s fear has ironically led him into a kind of isolation from the world he should navigate. Similarly, a depressed mind can be so busy fearing negative outcomes that it cuts off from life itself, worsening the emotional suffering.

# Modern Life: Fueling the Flames of Disconnection

So far, we’ve painted depression as a response to social alarm and brain misfiring. But why is depression rising now? Much evidence suggests that modern life has made it easier than ever to feel cut off, even as we seem more “connected” than ever. Here are some key ways our society may be fueling the mental health crisis:

* **Fragmented Communities:** In the old days, multiple generations often lived together and neighbors looked after one another. Today, people move for jobs or education, leaving extended families scattered and many adults far from their parents and friends, often never even meeting their neighbors. Those traditional safety nets are fraying.
* **Breakdown of Family Structures:** Divorce rates and single-parent households have increased, which can mean less day-to-day emotional support at home. At the same time, smaller family sizes mean fewer built-in playmates or companions. The casual, comforting interactions of growing up in a big family are rare for many.
* **Individualism and Pressure:** Western culture in particular prizes individual success and independence. While empowerment is good, it can also mean people shoulder burdens alone. If something goes wrong—job loss, heartbreak, failure—we’re often expected to “tough it out” rather than lean on friends.
* **Sedentary Lifestyles:** Ancient humans moved constantly, but today many of us sit at desks all day, then come home and relax by scrolling on screens. Our bodies get little exercise and do not signal reward the way they should, which can make the brain more prone to stress and sadness.
* **Digital Distraction:** Paradoxically, the same technology that is supposed to connect us can also isolate us. Social media, online games, and virtual relationships can feel safe and easy, but they often lack the warmth and complexity of face-to-face contact. It’s possible to have hundreds of “friends” online but still feel completely alone when the computer is off.

These factors combine to create a world where we’re physically close but emotionally distant. People might live in crowded cities or be surrounded by coworkers, yet never share a real smile or conversation. If you think about your daily routine, how often are you physically interacting with others in meaningful ways? If the answer is “not enough,” you’re not alone. Now many experts call loneliness an epidemic: large surveys show that a significant portion of adults report frequent feelings of loneliness or social disconnection.

# The Digital Dilemma: Abstract Connections

Let’s zoom in on the digital side of things. Technology has given us unprecedented ways to communicate: video calls, text chats, online communities. These can be wonderful, especially when loved ones are far away. But there is a downside. Most digital interaction is stripped of many human elements.

You can’t see someone’s body language on a text message, feel their presence, or share a comforting hug. Even video chats, while better, still remove layers of nuance and spontaneous joy that come from being in the same room together.

Social media, in particular, creates a double-edged effect. On one hand, it keeps us informed and in touch. On the other hand, it feeds comparison and alienation. We often end up scrolling through carefully curated snapshots of others’ lives — highlight reels of perfect vacations or happy moments — which can make our own lives seem dull by comparison. This comparison game tends to spark feelings of inadequacy or envy. If everyone else seems happier and better off, the brain may take it as a personal rejection.

All the while, our thumbs and brains crave that next notification, much like an opioid hit. Each like or message triggers a tiny dopamine rush, giving us a temporary “reward.” But those hits are fleeting and chaseable – we endlessly scroll or refresh to replicate them. This can turn into a compulsive habit. Ironically, that habit may keep us staring at screens while our real brains whisper, “I need something real.”

The danger here is that time spent online often replaces opportunities to build real-world bonds. If you come home at night and sit in another digital world, you may miss out on a family dinner conversation, a game with siblings, or even a chat with a neighbor. Over time, you might find the virtual world actually increasing your sense of disconnection. Your brain is left craving genuine social cues like touch or eye contact that no app can fully deliver.

# Movement: Medicine for the Mind

The good news is that some solutions may be right under our feet – literally. Physical movement, exercise, and dance are powerful tools for calming a distressed brain. Think of your body and brain as an integrated whole.

When you move, your muscles pump more blood, your heart rate changes, and your brain chemistry shifts. Exercise floods the body with endorphins and other mood-lifting substances. It also helps burn off excess adrenaline and cortisol, the stress hormone, effectively telling the brain that there is no immediate danger.

Movement also shifts focus. When you’re running or doing yoga or playing soccer, your brain often has to pay attention to the present moment – the beat of your footsteps, the sensation in your muscles, the need to coordinate your limbs. This can break the cycle of rumination. Imagine catching your mind as it starts to fixate on a negative thought: going for a walk or doing a quick set of jumping jacks can interrupt that train of thought.

In a way, exercise is like rebooting a computer. It clears out some of the clutter from your thoughts, giving your mind a fresh start.

And remember, movement is not just a solo medicine. Group activities – a neighborhood dance class, a community soccer game, or even a morning jog with a friend – combine movement with social interaction, hitting two birds with one stone. The sense of camaraderie and shared accomplishment can flood the brain with positive signals. Even something as simple as a walk in the park with a friend, where you talk and breathe fresh air, can be remarkably restorative.

# Rebuilding Real-World Connections: Grounding in Shared Reality

While exercise soothes the nerves, rebuilding social bridges heals the soul. We sometimes call meaningful face-to-face contact “grounding in shared reality.” It reminds our brain of what it was meant to handle all along: real human presence. What does this look like in practice?

First, it means valuing quality time with others. This could be family dinners without screens, weekend outings with friends, or joining clubs and groups that meet in person. It could mean volunteering at a local shelter or helping out a neighbor – activities that make you part of something larger than yourself. These interactions send a silent but powerful message to your brain: *“Yes, I belong. I am seen and valued.”*

Science backs this up with what we know about social hormones. For example, when you hug someone or even share a laugh, your body releases oxytocin, sometimes called the “love hormone.” Oxytocin reduces stress and creates feelings of trust and bonding. This simple chemical response can break through barriers of fear and sadness, reminding you that you’re connected to the network of people around you.

Another aspect of grounding is nature. Humans didn’t evolve staring at screens; we evolved outdoors. Studies have shown that even a short time in nature – a walk in the woods, time in a garden, or sitting by a lake – can lower anxiety and improve mood. This might be partly due to the repetitive and calming stimuli in nature (like the sound of leaves rustling or waves crashing) which can lull the brain’s threat system. These natural settings also allow for socializing in a relaxed context – think having a picnic with family or sitting around a campfire chatting with friends.

Don’t underestimate the small everyday contacts. The barista who makes your coffee and smiles, the bus driver who says hello, the coworker who asks how your weekend went – these might seem trivial but they send tiny doses of connection. By engaging kindly with people around us, we build a web of social reciprocity. Over time, these threads become a safety net; when big problems hit, we have a community to catch us.

# Practical Strategies: Strengthening Mental Resilience

So, how can individuals and societies act on these insights to stem the tide of depression? The strategies involve both personal habits and broader cultural shifts.

**Personal and Family Actions:**

* **Create social routines:** Make it a habit to meet people regularly. This could be a weekly family game night, a monthly book club, or a daily shared meal with housemates. Consistency builds safety and predictability, reassuring the brain that connections are stable.
* **Limit screen time:** Especially just before bed or right when you wake up. Instead of scrolling, try reading a book, journaling your thoughts, or chatting with a friend on the phone. These activities ground you in reality and reduce the comparison trap of social media.
* **Stay physically active:** Aim for at least some movement every day—it doesn’t have to be intense. Gentle yoga, a quick run, dancing, or even brisk house-cleaning all count. The key is to raise your heart rate or stretch your muscles regularly. You might invite a friend to be your exercise buddy; having a partner increases accountability and adds a social reward.
* **Practice mindfulness or meditation:** These techniques train your brain to observe thoughts without getting sucked in. Over time, mindfulness can reduce rumination by teaching you to gently redirect your attention to the present—your breathing, your senses, your immediate tasks.
* **Talk about your feelings:** Reach out to someone you trust when you’re feeling low. It could be a friend, a family member, or a counselor. Speaking your truth helps to diminish the sense that you’re alone with your pain. It also engages your prefrontal cortex in a productive way: analyzing and processing feelings instead of spinning them.

**Community and Societal Measures:**

* **Build inclusive communities:** Cities and towns can design more communal spaces — parks, plazas, community centers — where people naturally gather. Organizing local events, like festivals, sports leagues, or art classes, can rekindle a sense of neighborhood and belonging.
* **Promote mental health education:** Schools and workplaces can teach emotional literacy from an early age. If people learn how to recognize stress, anxiety, and depression early, they can take preventive steps sooner. Mental health campaigns can normalize reaching out for help and recognizing when someone else needs support.
* **Encourage work-life balance:** Employers can contribute by encouraging regular breaks, flexible hours, and team-building activities. Workplaces that foster a sense of camaraderie (rather than cutthroat competition) help employees feel valued as people, not just as workers.
* **Support accessible mental health care:** Societies must ensure that therapy and counseling are available and affordable. Group therapy or support groups can also provide the twin benefits of professional guidance and peer connection. When talking about depression becomes as routine as talking about diabetes or heart health, people are more likely to seek help early.
* **Regulate digital media thoughtfully:** Tech companies and governments might promote healthier online habits. This could include features that limit endless scrolling, or public campaigns about digital wellness that urge people to take “tech detox” breaks for their mental health.

Each of these steps works on either the individual level or the environment we live in. The goal is to change the default settings of our lives. Right now, the “default setting” of modern life often nudges us toward isolation and passivity (think: delivered food, remote work in solitude, entertainment done alone online). By consciously choosing activities that engage body, mind, and community, we push the settings back toward our evolutionary preferences: social connection, physical movement, and interacting with others in real life.

# A Brighter Outlook: Hope in Connection

Depression may be more common now, but understanding its roots gives us hope. Just as the causes come from our modern deviations, the remedies can come from returning to fundamentals: friendship, movement, nature, and purpose. When you start to view depression not as a mysterious flaw but as an overactive alarm signaling isolation or disconnection, you gain agency. You can begin to “reset the alarm” with conscious changes.

If you or someone you know is struggling, remember that it is not a personal failing. The very structure of our lives might be pushing many of us toward these feelings, not just individual choices. This recognition can be powerful: it means we can work together, as families, communities, and societies, to rebuild what modern life has torn apart. Science tells us that humans are resilient; our brains are plastic and capable of change at any age.

By building real connections – a warm conversation, a shared laugh, a helping hand – and by moving our bodies, we tap into natural healing systems. We remind our brains of what they were meant to handle: supportive companionship, challenges met with others by our side, and rhythms of day-to-day living that match our evolutionary design.

In the end, the modern rise of depression might be a warning sign from our collective psyche: telling us that something fundamental in our lives needs to change. By listening to that warning, and by taking steps to ground ourselves in relationships and reality, we can turn down the volume of despair. The path forward is a communal one, walked side by side, grounded in the simple truth that we humans are meant to care for each other.

Remember, even small steps can light the way: a phone call to a friend, a walk around the block, a moment of mindful breathing. These acts are more than routine; they are revolutionary acts of self-care and community care. Together, we have the tools to soothe our minds and help each other through the darkness toward a place of brighter connection.

1kkng0b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kkng0b,can you be so fr and tell me what might prevent a right swipe? (hinge/tinder),"i hope this is okay! i reviewed some of the other posts like this one, and every one was so helpful! 

do i look “too straight” “femme”? is it the way i look, choice of pics, or my bio? do i sound cold or without personality? 

i’m a bit of a softie but i can take it! here for constructive criticism 

fwiw, i do also have a profile on feeld which is obviously more catered towards my ‘demographic’ but the bio is basically the same 

if we live a similar lifestyle — enm, poly, etc is there a reason? (solo poly?) style? fashion? obviously, completely understandable and respectable if you are monogamous, not into tattoos, or have children, or opposing political beliefs 

is at as simple as that? the pool is small? gay, childfree, polyamorous, non-religious, “creatives” + cats 

i worry i have too many ‘non-negotiable’ but i’m not sure that those are aspects that i can compromise on (religion, politics, relationship style, child free stance?)

i am located in a major city in ohio, usa 

after coming out later in life, and previously dating women & men, the profile set to they/thems and women is very humbling! 

i may take a break off of the dating apps, but i would love any advice! 

i hope i don’t sound bitter! just trying to navigate this new dating world 

i have much better luck on tinder, but something about hinge & bumble feels more authentic 

i get a lot more ‘matches’ on tinder, but little to no reach outs, so i worry maybe there’s just blindly swiping right activity, but i feel womxn don’t do that in the same way men do, so perhaps it’s the age old classic wlw scared to make the first move, but i do try to message first but rarely receive a response, so i worry the match(es) were sort of ‘indifferent’ 

y’all im just scared 😭

if you would or wouldn’t swipe right, i would truly love your reasoning!

1kknfvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kknfvx/growing_up/,Growing up,"I don’t look or feel my age. I’m 19, but people often assume I’m 14. That alone might not bother me as much if I didn’t also feel years behind, mentally and emotionally.

I grew up extremely overprotected. My parents hired nannies to feed me, dress me and check on me constantly, so I was never really left alone. Until university, I had never taken a bus by myself. Even now, if someone opens the door to my room without knocking, I have a panic response. I get anxious, angry, and feel watched. My mom still enters unannounced to check on me, and it takes me right back to those caregivers who monitored me every minute.

Therapy helped me realize that all this overprotection affected my development. I missed out on learning independence, on building an identity, on growing at my own pace. I used to be so afraid of what my parents would think, I rejected anything that felt like “growing up.” I even developed obsessive-compulsive habits because I was always stuck inside my house.

As a teen, I didn’t know who I was, so I copied others. I lied about my interests just to fit in. I pretended to like fandoms, artists, and even said I was pansexual to be accepted into a group of “alternative” friends, even though I’m actually straight. I spent hundreds of dollars on K-pop merch and now co-lead the official fan club for an artist I no longer enjoy. But I’m stuck there because I don’t know how to step away.

Now that I’m in university, I’ve started to genuinely discover myself—and the person I’m becoming is someone my old friend group would’ve probably mocked. I love wearing colorful outfits (especially pink), eating healthy, grabbing a coffee (mochas are my favorite), wandering around the city, and taking lots of photos. I guess you could say I’m “basic”… but honestly, it feels like me. For the first time, getting dressed in the morning is easy instead of stressful. Effortless, I walk out the door feeling comfortable and confident. 

Yet the more I embrace this version of myself, the more I feel out of place with the people around me. My current friends don’t really see or support who I am now. I want to make new connections with people who match this new stage in my life, but it feels hard. People my age don’t seem very interested in talking to me (maybe because I look younger than I am, or because they still see me as the person I used to be).

I am ready to embrace change and finally catch up with the life I missed. I want to both feel and appear as a 19-year-old: confident, independent, and fully alive. I recognize this won’t happen overnight (in fact, it has been a gradual journey) but I’m committed to every step. I would be grateful for any advice you might share, especially on:

	•	Looking my age (I’ve always neglected my physical appearance)
	•	Growing emotionally after a lifetime of overprotection
	•	Finding a social circle that truly reflects who I am today

Riding the bus alone used to terrify me —now I do it every day. If I could overcome that, perhaps there’s hope for everything else, too :)",1,1747038668.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

What a terrible burden it is to want. 

After nights of waiting I found shelter in you, closed my eyes and for once I didn’t dream of monsters, the pitch black yielded stars once again and I no longer wished myself dead. That night I imagined motherhood as I stroked your hair, I listened to you breathe and watched the rise and fall of your back, felt the waves rise inside me and let myself get carried away. That night it consumed me, ate me whole leaving only a carcass of bones and matter, they even stole my heart just for good measure.

I lost my appetite, lost sleep counting myself lucky that we exist at the same time you and I. I typed out a message, stared at the screen, blinked and blinked and blinked then shook my head and all faded to white. Took a shot of vodka courage to make the journey to the great wall of blue text only to crouch behind it, cradling my knees to my chest like I did as a child, waiting for someone, anyone to tell me it gets better. It’s all wrong.

Why didn’t we wait for the buds to flower? I could stay a lifetime if you’d sit with me a little, tell me one of your stories to pass the time, I'm sorry I only have the clothes on my back to keep you warm. 

What a terrible burden it is to want you.
