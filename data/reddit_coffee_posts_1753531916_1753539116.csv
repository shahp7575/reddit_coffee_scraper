A1C stays around 6. I don't take insulin. I do not normally eat foolishly but do not follow .a strict T2D diet.

Had a breakfast of waffles, cereal, apple,apple juice,orange  juice, milk  and coffee at about  9 am at a hotel. No real  healthy food  to be had there.Started a drive from St.Louis to Chicago. At around 3,  stopped for gas and a bit of grocery shopping. While in store, I experienced symptoms that I immediately recognized as hypoglycemic drop. I carry some candy with me in case this happens, so I ate  a few pieces and felt better. I continued the drive.

While enroute at about 4: 30 I foolishly ate 3 Kit Kat Bars. Got to Chicago, and went for a walk at about 7. Midway thru the walk I felt symptoms of hypoglycemic drop, which I felt impossible since I had pumped large quantities of sugar into my body 2.5  hours earlier. Struggled to get back home and checked my sugars.

I expected to see a high glucose reading given all the sugar I put in m y body 2.5  hours earlier, but no, my reading was 67. So my question is ""How could I be hypoglycemic after putting lots of sugar into my body 2.5 hours earlier?""

Thanks in advance for any insights, and, Yes, I know I was stupid to eat all that sugar.",1,1753538924.0,diabetes,0,1.0,False

1m9u6uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneySaving/comments/1m9u6uw/how_i_saved_money_as_a_student_who_is_budgeting/,How i saved money as a student who is budgeting his allowance.,"Being a student with a set allowance actually helped me learn how to take care of money. One of the first things that I did was end some of my subscriptions. I used to pay for Spotify and Netflix every month, but I saw that those little payments quickly added up.  
  
I didn't totally give up on entertainment though. For Netflix, I discovered that I could simply watch with a friend who already had one because she doesn't pay it separately since it is part of her wifi, we'd plan our movie nights together, which surprisingly became something that I anticipated. For music, I reverted back to Spotify Free. Advertisements can be pesky, I suppose, but I also learned that YouTube playlists function perfectly as background music when studying.  
  
These are a couple of other things I altered:  
  
1. I stopped purchasing coffee outside and began preparing my own at home. Instant coffee may not be high class, but it does the trick.  
  
2. Rather than purchasing lunch daily, I began bringing food from home. It saved me approximately ₱150 per day.  
  
3. I borrowed novels from seniors or searched online for PDF copies rather than purchasing fresh ones.  
  
4. I canceled apps I wasn't even using. In the beginning, it was strange to not have it all in my pocket, but I adjusted.  
  
What I discovered is that you do not need to lose everything you merely need to adapt and be able to find ways around it that suit your way of life. ",1,1753538759.0,MoneySaving,1,1.0,False

1m9u5te,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1m9u5te/found_the_ai_prompt_that_makes_everything_10x/,Found the AI prompt that makes everything 10x more interesting,"I accidentally discovered this while trying to make boring work tasks less soul-crushing. These tiny tweaks turn any mundane topic into something you actually want to read:

1. Add ""What's the hidden story behind..."" — Suddenly everything has intrigue. ""What's the hidden story behind office coffee machines?"" Boom - corporate psychology, addiction economics, social hierarchies.

2. Use ""What would an alien anthropologist notice about..."" — Gets you that outsider perspective that reveals the weird stuff we ignore. ""What would an alien anthropologist notice about LinkedIn?"" Pure comedy gold.

3. Ask ""What's the conspiracy theory version of..."" — Not actual conspiracies, but the connecting-dots thinking. ""What's the conspiracy theory version of why meetings exist?"" Uncovers power dynamics you never saw.

4. Try ""How is [boring thing] secretly a survival skill?"" — Evolution angle makes everything relevant. ""How is small talk secretly a survival skill?"" Turns awkward chitchat into advanced social intelligence.

5. Flip to ""What would happen if we took [thing] to its logical extreme?"" — Pushes ideas to their breaking point. ""What if we took remote work to its logical extreme?"" Reveals both possibilities and problems.

6. End with ""What does this reveal about human nature?"" — The psychology angle that makes everything profound. Every mundane topic becomes a window into who we really are.

The trick works because it hijacks your brain's pattern-seeking mode. Instead of seeing isolated facts, you start seeing systems, stories, and connections everywhere.

Best part: This works on literally anything. Tried it on ""filing taxes"" and got a fascinating breakdown of social contracts, trust systems, and why we collectively agree to this madness.

Secret sauce: Combine multiple angles. ""What's the hidden story behind email signatures? What would an alien anthropologist notice? What does this reveal about human nature?""

Even grocery shopping becomes anthropologically fascinating with these prompts.

What's the most boring topic you've accidentally made interesting?

And what a great choice. I could have went to Thailand or Indonesia like most Mongolians do on vacation, but Russia hits different. And I found out that Russian Siberian cities are:

1. Ulan-Ude: Like a district of Ulaanbaatar. It's muddy, full of 5-story buildings, and there's nothing to do. Just go to Ivolgin Datsan, like Gandan, and it's great. Very spiritual. In essence, it's just a detour on your way to Lake Baikal.

2. Irkutsk: A slightly improved version of Ulan-ude, slapped with an Instagram filter and a couple of hipster coffee shops and IG type girls taking snaps. There's nothing to see except for the Angara, and that Erkhuugiin Khavar bridge. I felt the nostalgia and studying pain of my relatives echoing across the wind, lmfao.

3. Krasnoyarsk: If you put 100 ail, Narantuul, Bio, and ТЭЦ 3,4, slap together it with the worst traffic in our winter, and makeinto a whole city, this is what it would look like. But still, the bars were ironically top notch. One old uncle gave me 2 pints of beer at a bar, because he said ""I look like one of his Mongolian friends he knew in uni"".

4. Novosibirsk: An A copy of Ulaanbaatar. No difference at all. It's got a river in the middle, lots of 9 and 12-story buildings, angry uncles driving cars with right-hand steering wheels and shouting, fights outside the bar every night, and I got mugged while partying with my Russian friends. Lost around 600 rubles, sucks. So, it's basically Russian UB. Well, at least it has a metro, I'll give them that.

So if you go to Russia, you won't get lost at all. Because if you speak the language, there's literally no cultural shock, nothing different. Just the same paint of grey, decaying infrastructure that no one bothered to fix, and the same look of hopelessness that we see everyday. Otherwise, it's great.

1m9tw93,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmilieKiserUpdates/comments/1m9tw93/so_much_content_but_no_swimming_videos/,"So much content, but no swimming videos?","As a mom of young children this seems so bizarre to me…

Last night I was cleaning our pool before friends arrived, and my mind was spiraling a bit. I couldn’t stop thinking about how traumatic it would be to lose a child that way. Looking at our pool made me nauseous and I can’t image the PTSD that dad will have for the rest of his life (along with the grief and guilt). They are saying she is staying there and he isn’t. I really can’t image how HE could live there in the future (assuming he isn’t there now). I would get sick to stomach looking out the window. 

But while I was cleaning, I kept thinking about something that’s never sat right with me, the swimming narrative around Trig.

She kept saying he had Infant Resource Swimming (ISR) lessons but that doesn’t add up. Based on comments and other posts, it sounds like instructors confirmed he wasn’t actually enrolled (the company informed the instructors).

And if you’re familiar with ISR, you know it’s not casual swim time. It’s ten minute survival-based lessons (float on your back), 5 days a week for 6+ weeks, usually done in a set location not in your backyard. It’s very strict. I know this firsthand because I tried to find a modified schedule and was told absolutely not. In one video she mentioned swim lessons in their backyard and it being 4 days a week. She also mentioned he diving down and getting rings in the same breath which he wouldn’t have learned in that type of swim lesson. 

Clearly he wasn’t in an ISR swim program. 

What feels icky is this…for someone who shares everything (washing her face, brushing her teeth, waking up in the morning, driving around, changing diapers, random errands, pretty much anything). Which is weird AF but anyways there is not one single video of their child swimming????? 

I’ve seen videos of her holding the dog in the pool (but not her child). I’ve seen a clip of him in a hot tub wearing a puddle jumper. There’s one where he’s jumping into the pool over and over and they are sitting on the steps (video on the parents. Not showing the child). My thoughts…he was probably wearing a life jacket or puddle jumper and that would ruin her image as they had no pool fence, the kid can clearly open the door to let dogs out and she didn’t want people coming after her for being careless. Being a mom with a pool, seeing the toys left around/in the pool made me cringe. 

She makes videos of herself and her family as a living and he doesn’t work. where is the content?  No proud mom videos of him floating, paddling, swimming? Not even one?

As a mom with young kids and a pool, too. I get it drowning can happen even if a child is a great swimmer. But when you’re constantly creating content, it’s just strange to me that there’s a video of the dog in the pool, but not the child.

It just gives the ick. It really makes zero sense. I have a private fb/instagram and it makes me happy to share stories of them swimming and the new skills they learn. To not share one especially when you are filming yourself and your husband on the back steps but don’t turn your phone around to capture your child jumping into the pool….weird. He had to have had floaties on. 

I’m literally finishing my coffee and then getting in the pool before 9 am on a Saturday. There is no way she wouldn’t have filmed a get ready with me to go to the backyard to swim or something weird. They had a pool steps from their backyard. You would think if they choose not to have a fence one of them when have basically lived in the pool teaching him to swim.

Being sober honestly is so much better for me and I genuinely enjoy life more but I still crave stimulation/healing/ health just not intoxicating. I have found wonderful ways for me to enjoy that with adaptogens like Nello Supercalm, drinks like Kin euphorics or recess, nonalcoholic bars that serve functional NA cocktails (Oceanbeach Cafe in SF), I am a Muslim girl trying to heal and deal with life but also have balance and enjoy it as well. Islam honors balance. I am now taking a bit of a more intense but therapeutic approach… me and my other Muslim bestie are going to try these functional Mushroom gummies that have a blend of nootropics that I plan to microdose or take light doses to help heal my extreme OCD and anxiety (not rely on synthetic meds), cope with addiction, and enjoy life and stimulation in a peaceful and enjoyable way. These forms of stimulation are honestly so therapeutic and good for my cognitive/ physical health and help me enjoy my life still sober. Real intoxication comes with guilt, addiction, fixation, derealization and so much more pain. These methods are honestly so chill for me and I’m fine without them and fine with them. I also use matcha and black coffee as natural caffeine support when needed or to enjoy. I also use nicotine mints to help me deal with my nicotine slight reliance (I enjoyed to use coping that for real drugs ) that I wanna full cut off cuz it’s rlly bad for the lungs and health.

While a lot of the restaurants we went to were quite expensive, we mostly stayed away from the extremely fancy Michelin-starred tasting menu restaurants. Our restaurant visits skewed heavier towards places in the downtown area as that's where we were based.

**Mexican**
**Birrieria Zaragoza** - Slow cooked goat from Birrieria Zaragoza was probably our favorite dish is all of Chicago. Small menu, no frills, no gimmick just sublime food. Definitely coming back here any time we're back in town. 

**Tzuco** - Probably the place we have been to most number of times. Our place to take out of town visitors for a nice meal, as both regular and brunch menu were amazing. If we started listing recommendations, it would probably cover the entire menu. Honestly we can't remember a bad dish here. Also, the decor of this place was our favorite in Chicago.

**Carnitas Uruapan** - Like Birrieria Zaragoza, almost nondescript shop front, small menu, no frills; just straight to the point porky goodness. Get a weekday special, maybe a taco or two extra and enjoy a picnic at the nearby Harrison park. Tip: get their nopales salad on the side if the carnitas is a too overwhelming.

**Mi Tocaya Antojeria** - We wanted to really like Mi Tocaya, but maybe we had unreal expectations. The food was great, don't get us wrong, but we definitely feel there are better options in Chicago when it comes to Mexican food. Tepache as a drink option was a great addition to the menu, though.

**Tabu** - Went here on an off-night around Thanksgiving and had the place mostly to ourselves. Interesting food options like lobster taquitos and tyaluda nachos. But highlight was definitely their margarita flight. (Unrelated to food, the restroom area downstairs was quite unique.)

**Middle Eastern**
**Maman Zari** - One of our most favorite meals in Chicago was the tasting menu at Maman Zari. It's at the far end of the Brown line but the trip was totally worth. The food, the drinks, the service (for the price), everything exceeded our expectation. We really hope people discover this place. 

**Sifr** - We've been here couple of times, and both times got their nonveg mezze platter, and the branzino, all really good. But their drinks were probably more memorable than their food. (Also that place is loud.)

**Mediterranean**
**Purple Pig** - We have separately been to Purple Pig multiple times even before my wife moved to Chicago. Very popular, and in our opinion not without good reason. The tuna tartare is still one of the more memorable dishes we've had.

**Lil Babareeba** and **Cafe Babareeba** - We had a much better experience at Lil Babareeba than at the flagship. Among the tapas offerings the Matrimonio pintxo with anchovies was a delight! 

**Italian**
**Il Porchino** - Did not have a bad meal here, consistently great. The lasagna was always a great choice.

**Quartino** - Always crowded, probably with visitors. We thought the food here was simple and reasonably priced. Liked their eggplant parmagiana a lot.

**Tortello** - We like filled pasta and the tortellini and ravioli at Tortello were probably the best we had in Chicago. Also, got their bake-at-home lasagna couple of times.

**American/regional**
**Green Street Smoked Meats** - We never had the opportunity to go to Smoque, but didn't feel we were missing out as Green Street was consistently one of our favorite places to eat. Beef ribs, or brisket was our most common orders, with a side of elotes, tater-tot casserole and cornbread. 

**Manny's Deli** - It's an institution and probably the best Jewish deli we've been to outside New York. Good bread topped with a heap of great sliced meat - done perfectly. Too bad places like this are getting harder and harder to find. Btw their babka French toast was something we didn't expect to be so good. 

**Storyville** - Great Cajun food, especially their jambalaya and blackened fish. Unfortunately the service left much to be desired, especially with the mandatory surcharge.

**Small Cheval** - Simple yet good burger, but over-priced.

**Chinese**
**QXY** - Dumplings done exceedingly well. Favorite combinations: lamb and coriander, pork and pickled cabbage, and beef and onion. Also offers the options of take home frozen dumplings. (Unrelated to food, their monogrammed tableware and utensils looked really nice.)

**JM Seafood** - Lobster sticky rice. Looks epic, tastes even better.

**MingHin** - They seem to have done exceedingly well in the last few years as demonstrated by their proliferation. No complaints about their dim sum though. Our favorite items to order were the crispy pork belly, fu pei guen (pork tofu skin roll) and steamed pork spare ribs in bean sauce. (**Triple Crown** was a close second in the dim sum category.)

**Yao Yao** - If you want fish stew with pickled veggies on a cold winter day/night, this is where you should get it. 

**Hingkee** - If you want beef noodle soup on a cold winter day/night, this is where you should get it.

**Japanese**
**Gyu-kaku** - Yes, it's a chain but no denying that they are great at what they do: yakiniku. Does anyone know if they sell their dipping sauce? Also we like s'mores after dinner. 

**Juno** - Favorite sushi place within our price range.

**Kyu-ramen** - Good ramen, really weird seating.

**Miru** - Went here on a Lettuce gift card. Great views from the dining area/patio on the St Regis. The sushi was okay for the price. Highlight of the meal was the sesame mochi dessert and yuzu-based non-alcoholic cooler.

**Momotaro** - Despite the recommendations and reviews, we did not enjoy Momotaro as much as we would have liked to. Maybe we ordered the wrong things.

**Ramen-san** - On a more negative note, Ramen-san was one of the most forgettable ramen we have had: bland and expensive. 

**Indian** 
**Nadu** - One of our last meals in Chicago, but one of the best. Wish they opened a bit earlier. Regional Indian food done really well. Flavors very close to what you can expect if you in India. Bring a friend or two and go ala carte. Highly recommended: prawn belchao, gustaba, jackfruit, sea-bass paturi, and goat stew.

**Bar Goa** - Interesting concept: during the course of our meal, this place went from a restaurant to a club. The malwani fish curry and vindaloo were the highlights of the meal. 

**Bundoo Khan** - Our favorite Punjabi (tandoor/curry) restaurant on Devon.

**Sabri Nihar**i - Definitely the quality of Sabri has taken a nosedive in my opinion. I remember going there ten years back and being blown away. Returned twice since the pandemic and both were quite forgettable. Bundoo Khan across the street is definitely better. 

**Rooh** - Went there before the recent re-christening. Quite unremarkable. Most of the menu was trying to upscale northwest indian menu classics, but ending up being neither novel nor authentic.

**Southeast Asian**
**HaiSous** - Our other favorite place to bring out-of-town friends. Strategy: bring enough people to order both the seafood platter and grilled meat platter. Also don't forget to get the grilled octopus salad. They also have a great tasting menu if you're fancy (and a little less ravenous).

**Le Colonial** - This place is worth going to just for the beautifully designed dining room but their food is just as great. The menu is an amazing throwback to the French colonial Indochine cuisine which is quite rare to find these days.

**Tuk Tuk Thai Isan Street Food** - Great mix of Thai classics and regional dishes. The larb and papaya salads were great, but the Talay Pad Pong Karee was phenomenal.

Other Latin American
**El Rincon de Fabio** (Venezuelan) - We picked up some arepas once while walking from Argyle to Foster Beach from here and they were great! Wish we had picked up more (or lived closer).

**Cafecito** (Cuban) - Our neighborhood spot for good coffee and sandwiches.

**Folklore** (Argentine) - Beef in various forms, some more familiar than others. Also comically large portions. Bring at least four hungry adults if you plan to order the parrillada for two.

**Other European**
**Tryzub** (Ukrainian) - One of those places where the dining space is as impressive as the food. We haven't had much Ukrainian food before, but given our experience here, we're down for more. As a side note, whatever purees they had as dressing/garnish for the chicken kiev was delicious in their own right. (Also, the fact that the prices are based on important dates of Ukrainian history is one of the quirkiest things we've seen at a restaurant.)

**D4** (Irish/British) - Maybe not one ofc the more remarkable ones, but we've been here too many times to leave it off this list. (One of my wife's friends literally lived upstairs to this restaurant.) The curry fries and fish and chips were pretty good pubfare.

**Cocktail bars**
**The Alderman** - Favorite cocktail bar is Chicago, and by some distance. Very dynamic menu with classics as well as innovative masterpieces. Seats 16 at full capacity, but the best seats are at the bar where you can see the art play out before you. The whiskey sour is probably the best version of any classic cocktail I've ever had. (HaiSous-Alderman was one our favorite dine and drink combo.)

**Violet Hour** - This place will be missed. Amazing drinks in a very date-friendly environment.

**Three Dots and a Dash** - Very well executed tiki bar with great drinks and pretty good food options to boot.

**The Aviary** - While the pageantry was unrivaled, we felt the drinks themselves were no better than the Alderman or Violet Hour.

**Dessert**
**Brothers Creamery** - We like frozen custard and Brothers' is probably the best offering in Chicago. Our favorite flavors: Zesty Matcha, Belgian Pecan, and Nutella. One of our favorite things to do in the summer was to walk/bike from near Gold Coast to Brothers through the park or by the lakeside.

**Lost Larson** - Ended up at the Andersonville location purely by accident after a long bike ride. And thank goodness we did! We did not know what a semlor was, but now we know, along with how amazing it can be.

**Mango Mango** - We will get a mango mille crepe cake from Mango Mango whether we're in Atlanta or Hoboken or Chinatown in Chicago.

**Chiu Quon Bakery** - If you're looking for a Hong Kong style bakery with pork bbq buns, egg tarts and lao po bing, your prayer has been answered (actually they had been answered for a few decades ago).

**Sukhadia Sweets** - In case you have been invited to a Diwali or Holi or some other party by your Indian friends, this is where you come to pick up sweets. A very authentic representation of how such establishment work in India, complete with fresh lassi, savory snack section, and a mini vegetarian restaurant.

**Do Rite** - The donut is great (especially their olive oil one) but can I get the chicken sandwich?

**Kasama** - Super fancy dinner tasting menu doesn't mean that the croissant worth waiting for, and for that price. There are better options, a lot of them for baked goods.

Bonus
Fries at **Greek Kitchen inside Northwestern Steeterville** - If you are unfortunate enough to find yourself at the Northwestern hospital in Steeterville, comfort yourself with some fries from the Greek Kitchen in the food court. They're great. If you're feeling fancy, bring some Kewpie mayo and furikake just in case.

With all the places we have been fortunate to visit, there were places we would've liked to go, but could not for one reason or other. Hopefully next time we're in town we can chip away at this list slowly. In no particular order some of these are: Al Bawadi, Le Bouchon, Sun-wah, Taxim, Armitage Ale House, Valhalla, Thattu.

Dad pitched in on a theory that it's definitely in the junk yard around the corner. I got so excited and volunteered to look for it, like fuck it I'm gonna be the hero who brings this thing home, it's gonna be so much fun! I trudged through piles of junk in the heat, sand and puddles, followed by a swarm of mosquitoes, cut my shin on something sharp, basically turned the place upside down and found nothing. My parents were laughing, not at me but at their groundless premise, while I had a meltdown on our way home.

Another day I had some time after work so I went skating, which was my official recipe for a perfect day. I always do 10 of every jumps and spins I know,  counting only the ones done flawlessly, and I had completed all except one jump. Something was off that day, probably exhaustion from work, and I couldn't do it the high, powerful way I knew I could. I had skated for 3 hours and should have gotten off the ice at that point but I couldn't, I kept compulsively repeating that jump in spite, dozens of times, non of which remotely good, and then just dropped on the ice and cried.

Another time I was having a really bad day, I thought ""let's order some pastry and coffee from your favorite place, that'll save the day"". I was so miserable, and felt that the only good thing left on earth was that cup of coffee. Incidentally, that day the deliverer lost half my order, including the coffee, and I called him in such a rage alien to even myself, and I cried.

I probably sound like a childish brat who has to have their way, which I probably am, but the weird thing is, if some similar shit happened without me prefacing the day with ""this is gonna be great"", I wouldn't have cried at all-worse shit happens at work all the time and I don't cry, bc I know it's coming and I'm paid to deal with it. This sounds so stupid, but has anyone else been there? what did you do to feel healthier, and not like every day with some hope turns out to be ruined?

1m9tuuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1m9tuuo/i_found_a_wallet_and_ended_up_reuniting_two_old/,I Found a Wallet and Ended Up Reuniting Two Old Friends,"A few days ago, I was walking out of a grocery store when I spotted a wallet sitting on a bench outside. There was no one around, so I figured I should take it and see if I could find out who it belonged to. I opened it up, checked for ID, and the name on the license hit me with this weird sense of déjà vu. It was a name I couldn’t quite place, but something about it felt familiar.

I got home and, for whatever reason, asked my dad if he knew a guy with that name. To my surprise, my dad’s face lit up, and he said, “Oh yeah, that’s Mark. We were great friends back in college! I haven’t heard from him in years.”

I was kind of shocked. They were really close, but life had taken them in different directions, and they lost touch after graduation. Almost 30 years of silence between them.

Anyway, I found Mark’s business card in the wallet, so I decided to shoot him a message on Facebook. He responded quickly, and we set up a time to meet so I could return the wallet to him.

When we met, the first thing he said was, “Wait, you’re \[Dad’s Name\]’s kid, right?” And when I nodded, he just smiled like he was seeing a ghost. It turns out that not only had they lost touch, but they hadn’t even thought to reconnect until now.

We spent a few minutes chatting, and he mentioned that he was going to grab coffee the next day and thought it’d be nice if my dad joined him. So, the next day, they met up, and it was like no time had passed at all. They caught up about everything, college days, mutual friends, old jokes, and it was honestly kind of amazing to see two old friends reconnect so easily after decades.

What started as a simple act of returning a wallet turned into something I never expected: the revival of a friendship. It's crazy how small moments can lead to big things.

I believe this. I don’t believe she jumped, or even leaned over to vomit. I don’t believe the family is nefarious. Her brother was 21 at the time, and was a different person than he may be now and not as ‘political’. They were close siblings and I can see that in the pictures, podcasts, etc. I think they were just a regular family from Virginia. Even family friends saw how close they all were. I don’t believe she committed suicide so moving on. If you disagree, keep that to yourself. 

With that said, I’m thinking she’s out on the balcony laying down after her brother went to bed. Assuming she either took a quick nap or had trouble falling asleep, so instead of laying there, maybe she decided to go outside for a little and walk around the ship. Whether to go get water after a night of drinking, find another spot to pass out at on the top of the ship, get coffee, etc. I can see myself personally doing any of those things. Especially if there was no water in the cabin and I was thirsty.

She left the balcony door, thinking maybe she’ll be back quickly and didn’t matter if it was slightly opened (grabbing water or coffee theory). She probably didn’t close the slider all the way, to not wake her parents up (those make a lot of noise). She probably grabbed flip flops she had near the door or went barefoot - both not weird to do. Even Brad said he walked around barefoot since the hallways were carpeted. 

And then something nefarious happened in that time. Whether Yellow saw her and convinced her to go somewhere with him, maybe said there’s an empty room somewhere, someone grabbed her, etc. That might explain the two girls seeing her. Only issue I’m stuck with is how she left the boat. They weren’t docked at this point to fully leave, and If she was on the boat, I don’t think she’d ignore the intercom when they told her to come to the front desk or whatever the message was. She had to have either somehow already left the boat, or in a situation she couldn’t escape from ",5,1753537721.0,AmyLynnBradley,2,1.0,False

1m9tq3q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m9tq3q,"Timemore Millab M01 Review - Stunning, Flawed and Will Outlive Mankind","### **A Review of the Timemore Millab M01: Stunning, Flawed and Will Outlive Mankind**

**TL;DR:**
It's big, stunning, and satisfyingly well-made, and the coffee is great. However, Timemore's QC needs work. The ""pineapple"" burrs are great, but not a revolutionary leap beyond other high-end hand grinders.

---

#### Preface
I've had my Timemore Millab M01 for a few weeks now. This isn't my first Timemore product, nor is it my first high-end grinder. I've also had a long career in specialty coffee, so I'm no stranger to a wide range of equipment. With that being said, this is obviously just my personal, honest opinion and my observations on the grinder so far (plus some comments on dealing with Timemore as a company).

#### The Preorder Experience
Delays are fine. Not communicating them is not.
This pretty much sums up the preorder experience here in the EU. I had to chase them constantly for updates.

#### Unboxing, Bells & Whistles, and Initial Impressions
I'm not an ""unboxing"" person, but here are the highlights:

* **Packaging:** It was delivered in a box large enough for an electric grinder. The product box itself is also really large, but well-made.
* **The Coin:** It comes with a commemorative coin which, in my opinion, is totally pointless.
* **The Brush:** What's *not* pointless is the cleaning brush. It's beautiful. And it *exists*, which is more than Comandante can say for themselves. Seriously, that has always bothered me. The Comandante box is enormous, the grinder costs a lot, brushes are cheap, and grinders need to be cleaned. Get it together, Comandante. (Or maybe they include one now? It's been a few years since I unboxed one). I digress. Timemore has always known how to make a good coffee brush. It isn't hard, but they do it well. Except... they took a shortcut and used a cheap coating on the metal that scratches instantly. You can't win them all, I suppose.
* **The Size:** This grinder is huge. It weighs 1.1kg. I've included a picture of it next to a Timemore Nano for comedic purposes.
* **The Engraving:** A message to Timemore: please hire a translator. On the bottom of your quite expensive new grinder is the phrase: *""Products with professions and aesthetics for coffee lovers""*. This does not make sense. I don't know how many people work at Timemore, but I'm quite sure at least one of them has access to the internet.

#### Grinding & Coffee Quality
You'd think this section would be the grand finale, right? Well, no.

The ""pineapple"" burrs produce great coffee and usually manage a sweeter cup than my Timemore Nano or Comandante, but it's not a night-and-day difference. I was also disappointed to find it didn't grind any faster than the other two (how is this possible?). The particle distribution is very even, without creating a cup that lacks depth.

Overall, I was impressed, just not €380 impressed. Or maybe I was. I don't know.

#### Usability & Ergonomics
* **Adjustment Dial:** The click-adjustment dial is fantastic. Like much of what Timemore does, the tactile feel is flawless. Tiny little clicks that seat perfectly. Sure, the writing is small, but it's not small enough to give any merit to the people who complain about it. It's a hand grinder, not a street sign.
* **Grinds Cup:** The twist-on grinds cup is also flawless and extremely satisfying. It's magically easy to twist on and off, yet stiff enough that I'm never worried it will fall out.
* **In Use:** Again, it's big. This generally affects usability, but the crank handle is very long, so there's plenty of torque to make grinding easy. Unless you're grinding a 50g dose for espresso (and who would do that?), it won't take long. That said, it weighs 1.1kg. I pity the person who drops this on their foot, a glass stovetop, or even a tile floor. The tile doesn't stand a chance.

#### Build Quality & The Bearing Incident
For me, this part is far more interesting and deserves to be the finale. You can make great coffee on grinders that cost a quarter of the price, but you can't find many that are built so well they're genuinely *exciting* to pick up and use (the Timemore Nano being the exception; it's the one grinder I'll never sell).

So how exciting is the Millab? Somewhat...

In my humble opinion, Timemore has some of the best manufacturing in the game, but they do not have the QC to match. Generalising enormously here, of course, but there's a stereotypical difference between Timemore and Comandante. The Timemore *manufacturing* is leagues ahead of Comandante; it's not even close.

However! I've never seen a Comandante with a top bearing so loose that it falls out when you tip the grinder upside down. I sent Timemore a video of this, as the bearing is quite clearly too small for its housing and can be wiggled around with a finger.

*They responded saying that it was designed this way.*

I will leave it to the reader's discretion what to make of that.

Questionable bearing aside (the other two are flawless and don't fall out), the rest of the grinder is quite special. It really is stunning, and the way everything fits together is impressive. It’s like a Kinu M47 but with a much sexier design (obviously subjective, but this is my review, so I make the rules).

#### Final Verdict

**Is it the best hand grinder currently available?**
I'm not sure, but I think it's at least as good as any other I've tried in terms of cup quality.

**Is it worth the money?**
If you get one that doesn't have a loose bearing or nonsensical text on the bottom, then it's at least as good a value as a Kinu M47.

**Does it have room for improvement?**
Significantly less than any human I've ever met, but the answer is still ""yes"". 

**Should you buy one?**
Probably not. It depends.
If you are obsessed with build quality, then I think this or the Kinu M47 is what I would choose if I was me, which I am. 
If you're after overall value, it's a resounding ""no"". Buy their C5 or the Nano or something that is significantly cheaper than €380. You simply don't need to spend that much to make great coffee and there's lots of good options out there.

That said, I thoroughly enjoy using it daily and I'm excited to make coffee in the mornings. Which is the most important thing. Flaws and all.",7,1753537502.0,pourover,6,0.82,False

1m9tpwz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m9tpwz,Uncruise Review April 26-May 3,"A little bit about me. I have been on quite a few mainstream and premium cruise lines but never a luxury or expedition cruise. Back in 2017 I went on the Holland American Niew Amsterdam on an inside passage Alaskan trip from Seattle. That was also a fantastic time but very different. I am 29 year old m who traveled with my 26 year old GF. Recent cruises over the past few years had all been on Celebrity in inside cabins or aqua class on older ships.

I was planning to propose this trip so wanted something special. After some research decided to go with Uncruise doing a round trip itinerary leaving from Juneau. The particular itinerary was titled Wild, Woolly, and Wow and was an adults only trip labeled as a summer camp for adults. 

Day 1 we landed in Juneau after a trip from Florida around 1pm. Was a dreary day with rain and mist. Trip started out with a curveball being thrown when the hotel I booked (Fourpoints) was still renovating their rooms told us when we got there that we had to be rebooked and move to the Baranof about 4-5 blocks away. Also it seems everyone from our flight also had booked Fourpoints and I would learn many people from our cruise also had the same experience. The poor front desk employee was stuck rebooking multiple groups of customers and then driving the groups herself to the Baranof. The Baranof was perfect for this time of year when it is still chilly. I had heard complaints of it being unbearably hot in the summer. Following this small issue we headed to Dave’s for some fish tacos and a beer. Our new hotel was about a block away from Dave’s and it was great! It was fun experiencing a little cold outside around their fire pits enjoying hot fish tacos and some beers. We spoke to a nice couple for about an hour that was on a cruise that I believe left from Tampa or Texas but sounded like they had been on quite a fun multi-week journey. That Carnival ship was the only ship in port that day.  After this we bar hopped around Juneau including visits to the Red dog Saloon, Devil’s Club brewing, and the Crystal Saloon. Going so early in the season some bars and shops were not even open yet! I particularly liked Devil Club brewing a little too much and woke up with a hangover the next day.

Day 2 Waking up and looking at the snow capped mountains was such an amazing change from Orlando Florida where we live. We had until 4 or 5pm when we would embark on the Wilderness Legacy. We ate a good breakfast at the Rookery and then wandered around town looking at shops and seeing the sites including visiting the state museum. Was fun to learn about all the history before traveling through such a small slice of it. Also it was fun to see Juneau come alive in the morning preparing for the Cruise Ships to arrive.  Eventually we had about two hours left we posted up at the Imperial bar and I watched my MLS team win! We then grabbed our luggage and walked to the Uncruise terminal. Check in was earlier that day and took about 1 minute. All the passengers were gathered outside and then led onto the ship at once. They took our photograph to put in a book showing your fellow passengers, we shook hands with the captain, and then was given a mini tour of ship and led to our cabin. I had booked the least expensive cabin which was effectively two twin beds and a small bathroom. However the beds were very comfortable and the room was very clean! We were then gathered in the main lounge for a champagne toast and we were off! The Legacy is a charming boat with quite the interesting decor. Looks more like a river cruise boat than a cruise ship! We were then served dinner and learned that all meals you sat at a shared table with 4 other guests which was a blast to get to talk to a get to know your fellow guests. After dinner we were educated on the activities the next day. My girlfriend and I then hung out in the lounge until we went off to bed. Well first we sat on the aft of the ship and watched the sun set and spotted some Dall’s porpoises.

Day 3 I woke up early before the ship lifted anchor and wow we were anchored in a surreal cove with sea otters swimming about. I walked to the top deck after grabbing a coffee to enjoy the beautiful weather. We then headed off to Hobart Bay. We were so lucky that morning we saw an Orca, and soon saw multiple humpback whales leisurely swimming about. A pod of Dall’s porpoises also surfed off our bow. As we entered Hobart bay we saw about 8 humpbacks at once if you scanned the horizon with a young male splashing the water with his fin constantly to either help feed or communicate with the others that there was food in the area. They truly are majestic creatures and being on a small ship makes it only more magical. Our captain would simply stop and head towards the most interesting thing at a drop of a hat. We were eventually led from the excitement and given talks on safety and the basics of kayaking, hiking, bear safety and getting on the Zodiac boats. After lunch our first activity began we had picked the kayak activity. That was awesome we were able to get incredibly close to curious sea lions, sea otters, birds, and the humpback whales. The whales could not care less we were around and swam gracefully around us. Also smelled the foul scent of whale breath for the first time. The male also continued his swatting of the water about 200 feet from us. A magical moment. After about three hours we were back on the ship eating dinner and watching for more wildlife from our ship. After dinner we headed to the lounge/bar for some drinks, our first education lecture put on by a member of the expedition team, and then watched for more wildlife while chatting with new friends. 

Day 4 woke up a bit later on this day and woke up to the sound of ice thumping the hull as we were making our way to the Laconte glacier. Wow what an adventure so much ice as it was so early in the season I didn’t think we would be able to make it through the ice fields in the fjord. But we did! It was awesome drinking coffee and watching the ship thump its way through the ice fields. After about halfway through the fjord we stopped and were launched in the zodiac boats to do a two hour tour of the area! Thereafter we were loaded back on to eat lunch and watch the ship continue the journey to the glacier. Once there we were loaded back into the Zodiac boats to get close to the glacier to watch the calving and explore the area around the glacier. We also took a shot of bourbon on glacier ice while in the zodiac boats! We then headed back to the ship for dinner, relaxation, some more drinks, and another educational lecture while watching the ship wind its way back out of the fjord. 

Day 5 woke up to gorgeous weather near Thomas bay. After a hearty breakfast we embarked on another Kayak. Here it was awesome to see the tidal life that exists in Alaska and we got to see and hold so much of it including sea stars! We also saw more birds and sea otters. After lunch and a brief relocation to Keiku island we embarked on our first bushwhack where a zodiac boats drops your group of about 6-8 people off with your expedition guide leading the way through wildlife trails. There are no hiking paths out here! It was so much fun hiking through the temperate rain forest learning about the environment, different plants, trees, moss, fungi, bugs, and wildlife that call the area home. I kissed a banana slug, and even fell on the way down causing me to do a somersault across some slippery logs. After trekking for about 3 hours and only making it about 4-5 miles we were rescued by a zodiac boats at the shore a returned to the ship. After a hearty dinner, some drinks, and another educational lecture we went to bed. 

Day 6 I arose early in order to get some work done in the lounge area and enjoyed some coffee and some overnight oats with fresh fruit. After breakfast I mentally prepared myself for the adventure ahead and perhaps proposing if I could find the correct place by watching more wildlife as we entered Neka Bay. Today we had signed up for the all-day “yak and whack” 
After being given our pack lunch we were off for a kayaking adventure exploring Neka bay. We saw minks, sea otters, seals, birds, and some odd  jellyfish. After exploring via Kayak we had our lunch on the shore with some wine. It started raining when I was going to propose so I held off. We eventually began our bush whack through the forest before heading back to the ship. All in all it was 7 hours of adventure in beautiful southeast Alaska. We also saw our only brown bear today. After more conversation with new friends, another educational lecture, and more drinks it was off to bed. We also saw a couple humpbacks as we left Neka bay

Day 7  As I woke up we were beginning to enter glacier bay heading towards the glaciers. After a hot coffee, I enjoyed the weather including beautiful snow and more ice fields. Spotting seals and otters amongst the ice while it was snowing made for quite the enjoyable morning. After cruising close to some glaciers we anchored near the lamplugh glacier. I had picked the glacier meander for our morning activity. We boarded the Zodiak and was dropped off in the glacier field in front of the glacier. We explored the field with huge chunks of ice and took photos amongst the ice it’s the glacier, and waterfalls as the backdrop. This is where I proposed. Thankfully she said yes. Back on the ship the crew made the moment so special and news quickly spread amongst the crew and new friends. Next was the polar plunge which was like a pool party with music blasting and people cheering as you jumped into the near freezing water of glacier bay. Wow that experience was awesome but I thought I might also die. The darkness of the water was obviously different from the Caribbean I am used to. After being served a whiskey hot chocolate and feeling like myself I went back out to cheer on the others also jumping into the freezing cold of the bay. After lunch we hopped on another kayak to explore the areas waterfalls, floating ice, and surrounding wildlife. After another enjoyable evening harassing the bartender and talking to new friends we went off to bed.

Day 8 another day in glacier bay! Morning routine was down by this point. In the morning we did our last bushwack and explored an area of glacier bay. After trekking a few hours in the forest trying to soak up as much of the air and experience as possible we began our journey out of glacier bay. However on the way out we stopped to view a pod of orcas swimming next to our ships, more humpbacks, and sailed past some very stinky colonies of sea lions. The captain would literally either stop the ship to allow us to see these creatures or would veer off course. The afternoon consisted of slowly traveling back towards Juneau, exiting glacier bay and spotting more wildlife. I also obtained the very prestigious rank of junior park ranger of glacier bay by participating in a group presentation. About half of the passengers participated in the presentation and was our way of saying bye to the crew and thanking them. After another evening of swapping stories, drinking craft cocktails, and mourning that the journey was basically over, we went back to our cabin to sleep for the final time.

Day 9 - early morning breakfast and sadly disembarkation. Whole process was smooth and sad. We were transported to the Juneau airport via Uncruise contractors and our adventure was over.

Overall this was a trip of a lifetime. It was a unique way of exploring southeast Alaska outside of the cruise ports. However, it was very expensive. It was about $10,000 for the two of us for the week. Everything was included once on the ship including all alcohol on board and all activities/excursions. The food was overall very good. There was an all you can eat dungness crab feast one night as well. The crew and service was fantastic. The expedition guides were amazing. The coffee was mediocre. The fellow guests met on the cruise were all awesome to speak to and become friends with. As a purely value perspective compared to other cruises it would be like a 6.8-7.3. However when taking into account the almost unexplainable vibe and feeling when on the ship it is a 10/10 and will be booking with Uncruise again when I can afford it. The camaraderie on the ship is not something I have ever experienced. There were about 30 total crew and 52 guests on board for our sailing.

1m9topa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1m9topa/reveal_if_physicians_choice_60b_probiotics/,Reveal if Physician's CHOICE 60B Probiotics Deliver Results in This Comprehensive Review!,"Physician's CHOICE 854226008001 Probiotics has been a part of my daily life for weeks now, and I can confidently say it’s been quite an interesting journey navigating its benefits and quirks. This probiotic supplement boasts 60 Billion CFUs, 10 diverse strains, and organic prebiotics aimed at improving gut health, digestion, and supporting relief from constipation, diarrhea, gas, and bloating. With its sleek bottle that fits easily in my cluttered medicine cabinet and claims backed by science, I decided to dig deeper into what this product truly offers.

**Packaging and Build Quality**  
The bottle design is compact and functional, which I appreciated as someone who likes things orderly. It doesn’t require refrigeration, a bonus for anyone tired of rearranging their fridge to accommodate yet another supplement. The capsules themselves are small and easy to swallow – no choking hazards here! However, the shelf-stable claim made me slightly skeptical at first, but thankfully I haven’t noticed any decline in quality or potency.

**Effectiveness and Gut Health**  
Probiotics aim to aid digestion, and this one gets the job done. After incorporating it into my routine, I found a noticeable reduction in bloating, something I’ve struggled with after meals for years. My gut seems happier, and the occasional discomfort I’ve felt from constipation became a rare issue. These results, for me and my partner who also tried it, were surprisingly consistent, but individual results may of course, vary.  

[Check Physician's CHOICE 854226008001 price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b079h53d2b/)

**Standout Benefits**  
- Contains 10 high-quality probiotic strains that support digestion effectively.  
- Designed with acid-resistant capsules to survive stomach acid.  
- Organic prebiotics enhance the overall synergy for gut health.  

**Flaws in the Mix**  
No product comes without its faults, and while this probiotic offers much, there are some areas to note:  
- The capsules, though small, have a slightly bitter aftertaste.  
- For such a high CFU count, some might feel initial digestive discomfort during the adjustment phase.  
- People with sensitive stomachs may need to start with a lower dose or consult their doctor.  

**Support for Daily Nutrition**  
As someone who frequently deals with irregular meal plans and stressed digestion, this supplement feels like it bridges a gap in my nutrition. Its impact is subtle yet tangible, and I’ve come to prioritize it just as much as my morning coffee. It's made stress-inducing side effects like random gas episodes less frequent — a truth my coworkers might silently thank me for. 

**Competitors**  
Delving into alternatives, products like Align Probiotic and Garden of Life RAW Probiotics come to mind. While Align is known for its targeted approach to IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), it offers fewer strains and CFUs. Garden of Life boasts a more natural ingredient base but is refrigerated, which might not suit everyone. Physician’s CHOICE strikes a balance—it provides a convenient non-refrigerated option with a high CFU count and carefully curated strains. However, its “one-size-fits-all” formula may not address hyper-specific gut issues like Align’s specialized product line.  

**Value for Money**  
Here’s the catch—considering the variety of strains and the sheer 60 Billion CFU count, Physician’s CHOICE does offer amazing bang for your buck. The safety aspect is evident in their 3rd-party testing and US-based manufacturing under strict quality control. But if you’re only dipping your toes into probiotics, its potency may feel like overkill. For seasoned probiotic enthusiasts though, it’s a worthy investment for overall gut wellness.

I used to believe them and just disappointedly order something else. 

Then, the other day/week they put out a sign (first day of the promtion) for a Tiramisu Espresso Shake. I'm pretty sure it was the first day of the promotion because I was there the night before and there was no sign. 

Anyway I go in and ask for the Tiramisu Espresso Shake and the barista at the cash register asks the one working on the line and he says they don't have the tiramisu mix or whatever. While I'm contemplating what to get, someone else comes out of the back--the person I think is the manager, but not sure. I ask the batista at the register why they don't have tiramisu on the first day of the promotion and the manager overhears, comes over and says ""oh, we have it"" and they ring it up without comment (no surprise that they actually have it or anything). 

I asked a friend who works at a local coffee shop (not Starbucks) what might explain this behavior and he said sometimes these promotion drinks are harder to make and the workers don't get anything for making them vs easier standard drinks. 

Now, every time I'm told they don't have something I want to ask if they really don't have it or they just don't want to make it. It paid off the other day when we wanted a shortbread cookie they claimed to have none of (suppsedly because the oven was broken), but when pressed they suddenly somehow found *two. *

My name's Brian from the Netherlands. Currently, I'm working towards a bachelor degree majoring in communication and work a little on the side, but that's stuff that's boring, so enough about that. I like gaming on my Switch, PC and PlayStation and I do a teeny tiny bit of photography and sketching when I get inspired. The sketching I do both on paper with pencils and digitally using a pen display. I usually also watch sci-fi/fantasy series and movies, and on occasion animated shows (like anime or western animation). I'm very introverted and be a bit shy until I get comfortable talking to you.

I'm looking for someone about my age that is also looking for a serious long term relationship. While I have little prior experience with relationships, I do value strong connections and want to build a special and even stronger one. I wouldn't say I have any set preferences in terms of appearances, but I do prefer being around a similar age. While I'm also not against an LDR, I prefer someone who lives nearby (nearby = Netherlands/Belgium/UK/Germany), but it's not an issue if you live farther away. It's not a problem for me if the distance between us is big. Because if the spark is there, then no distance will be too great. Of course, I'm open to just being friends too, but that's if we end up not being compatible as more.

I hope to get to know each other. I'm down to meet up for some coffee, but first let's get to know each other with a nice chat. Talk to you soon!",1,1753537137.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1m9tk7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frozen/comments/1m9tk7f/chapter_332_of_frozen_quantum_snowflake/,Chapter 3-3.2 of Frozen: Quantum Snowflake,"“Elsa, this is…your esteemed mother?” Xing Tianwen froze for a while and deliberately chose this respectful phrasing.

“She is.” Xing Tianwen bowed immediately after hearing Elsa’s reply.

“There's no need for such formality, right? Xing Tianwen?” Elsa looked at Xing Tianwen awkwardly, asking this “alien that mother has never met before”.

“Because in the morality of my hometown, one should treat other’s mother with the same respect as one’s own mother. And I even…” Xing Tianwen's voice dropped low, but Elsa didn't notice.

“This is Xing Tianwen, a scientist from another world. But his world seemed to have…experienced some catastrophic events. That’s how he came to ours.” Elsa pulled Xing Tianwen's hand and let him stand in the center of the snowflake pattern on the ground.

“I'm sorry to hear this. May the forces of nature help you. They protect all those who trust it or not.” Iduna suddenly let a gust of warm wind blow on the ice crystal platform, brushing across Xing Tianwen's hair, as if her hand was gently stroking his head.

Elsa gently held Xing Tianwen's wrist, and ice-blue magic began to flow between them. “Relax, let me help you connect to mother's memory vault.” Her voice was as gentle as coaxing a child to sleep.

Xing Tianwen's pupils constricted sharply, and he yanked his arm back. “Wait! This, this is not safe!” He staggered back, hitting the ice wall and bouncing back as if he had been electrocuted—perfectly demonstrating a scientist's primal fear of unknown.

“Don't be afraid,” Iduna's projection cast a warm halo, and a soft icy-grass mat rose on the platform. “Look, even the thorns of Northuldra are softened for you.”

Xing Tianwen curled up on the edge of the platform, gripped his head with his hands defensively. “My memories have antimatter formulas! Quantum computer passwords!” His voice trembled, and his fingers scratched the ice unconsciously - this action made Elsa frown in pain, because his nails were already bleeding.

Elsa knelt on one knee in front of him, holding a glowing ice lotus in her palm. “Mother will not rob anyone of their knowledge.” The ice lotus slowly bloomed, revealing a miniature model of the World Tree inside. “She only wants to understand you.”

When Elsa tried to touch Xing Tianwen's temple again, he rolled aside like a frightened animal. This action was too real—even the ice of Ahtohallan trembled slightly, as if they pitied for his resistance.

“Please…” Elsa’s voice was choked with sobs. She didn't expect to make him so painful. Some warm tendrils suddenly grew out of the ice crystal platform, gently wrapping Xing Tianwen like a cocoon—this was the tenderness that Ahtohallan had never shown to anyone other than Elsa.

Xing Tianwen's trembling gradually subsided, and he peeked at the projection of Iduna through his messy hair. The goddess was watching him with a maternal gaze, and the ice crystals around her turned into a lullaby-like stream of light.

“Just…just share a part…” He finally compromised with a hoarse voice, like a soldier surrendering his last line of defense. When Elsa's magic connected again, he still tensed his muscles reflexively, but at least he didn't run away again.

Memories began to flow—the loneliness of the cryo-cabin in childhood, the smell of coffee in the laboratory, the despair when the sun exploded…all turned into glowing streams and flowed into the world tree. Iduna closed her eyes to feel these memories, and suddenly looked at Xing Tianwen with sorrow. A drop of water that quickly froze into ice fell from the top of the cave into Xing Tianwen's palm.

“So that’s how it is.” The goddess’s sigh resonated throughout the glacier, “You carried a heavier burden than I imaged.”

Xing Tianwen stared at the melting ice in his palm, his eyes reddened like a lost child—this was not in the plan of the script, but it worked well beyond expectation. Elsa completed the final connection, and their memories intertwined into starlight in Ahtohallan.

When the light faded, Xing Tianwen was curled up on the floor. Elsa hugged him up gently and found that—this scientist who could destroy the world was as light as a snowflake.

“So…can I take a look now?” After waiting for a long time, Elsa patted Xing Tianwen's shoulder sympathetically.

“Read whatever you want…tomorrow the Northuldra kids will probably sing my weapon system’s password as a nursery rhyme."" Xing Tianwen slowly stood up and patted his white coat—which was already tattered.

“Well, in addition to my memories, you can also see the memories of Anna, Kristoff, and my parents and grandparents. These are the compensation for you.” Elsa waved her hand to remove the memory fragments on the wall, and then condensed them into three-dimensional images built with ice and snow. “Don't worry, if you get lost among these statues, mother will help you to find the way to me.”

Xing Tianwen and Elsa parted ways among the statues and walked in opposite directions.

“Child…bury me…and physics…together here…” The first group of ice sculptures Elsa saw was the scene when Xing Tianwen blew up the lab. The person who spoke was Xing Tianwen's mentor, Kolleen Zhang, who was dying from the strong electromagnetic radiation at this time, but refused Xing Tianwen's rescue. Then, Xing Tianwen, who was trembling in the escape pod, triggered the bomb in the lab.

""So…you really explode the lab for me…” Elsa was stunned for a moment and quickly switched to the next group.

“The International Court has now ruled that: Defendant Xing Tianwen, who committed anti-human crimes, will be sentenced to forcibly cryosleep for 150 years, all his political rights and all titles deprived for life!” In the second group of ice sculptures, Xing Tianwen was escorted to the cryosleep prison. Media around the world simultaneously broadcast the International Court's verdict. The same media that used to hail him as “today’s Einstein” now jeered him with all their power: “Wish you will be completely forgotten by the world 150 years later!” “Come and see! The living fossil has run onto the street! There will be fewer of them!” “Take a broom and clean up the road you have walked on! Reaper!”

However, before going into hibernation, Xing Tianwen murmured, “At least…the two worlds…are safe…”

Elsa didn't dare to look any longer and could only walk past quickly.

“Our king can never be a puppet of digital life!” 110 years later, the cryosleep prison was engulfed in flames, and a group of thugs armed with antique gunpowder weapons rushed in. After they thawed Xing Tianwen in advance, they immediately removed the sensor on his forehead - that was an experimental device placed on his head by scientists to research on digital life.

“Long live the Swordbearer!” The scene switched to the “Home of Primitive Humans” on Pluto, which was the base of the anti-digital life group. Except millions of people here, humans on other planets in the solar system all get access to digital life, and their daily lives are filled only with endless enjoyment. Xing Tianwen was sitting on a towering throne, but his eyes were as empty as a puppet. In fact, he rarely used the ruling power as a dictator. His daily work was still continuing physics research, rather than dealing with policies.

“You... were also forced to a throne that wasn’t yours…” Elsa's eyes were already wet.

“And worse: he was on the eve of the apocalypse.” Iduna said as she pushed the next set of ice sculptures in front of Elsa.

Xing Tianwen was sitting on the throne, dishevelled and listless, which made his imperial robe covered with medals so ridiculous. He was holding a combination lock in his trembling hand—it was the detonator of the antimatter weapon, and once it was detonated, the sun would turn into a black hole. On the display screen beside him, the human generals kept sending reports of their defeat in the battle against the AI rebels, and urged him to detonate the antimatter and perish everything.

“The final order from emperor: let ‘Houyi’ fire the arrow. Hope the next civilization won’t need to war with its own wisdom.” Xing Tianwen was even as calm as a pool of stagnant water, and then detonated the antimatter hidden near the sun.

“Wait…I might still be able to see her once again…” Xing Tianwen was about to lift his pistol to commit suicide, but he caught a glimpse of the white coat he had sealed up - that was what he wore when he met Elsa, also what he wore in cryosleep.

The ice sculptures in Xing Tianwen's memory suddenly disappeared. Elsa turned around and saw the real Xing Tianwen still staring at the image of Elsa and Anna playing when they were children. He obviously hadn't seen anything, but…it seemed like he had seen everything.",2,1753537052.0,Frozen,1,1.0,False

[Come on guys, don't be like that... maybe it's true love? Even though that old dude could totally be her dad.]

...

Before Cameron's reply, the group chat was absolutely roasting me alive.

Cameron and I lived in completely different worlds.

He was this ethereal pretty boy who somehow made basic button-downs look designer. Always top of our class, loaded family—grandfather's some hotshot academic, dad's a professor at Princeton, mom runs a Fortune 500 company.

Meanwhile, I'm just me and my mom, and I've been bullied since I was a kid..

To protect both of us, I started working at Master Kim's taekwondo studio and earned my black belt in the process.

I was totally focused on hustling and making cash to help mom out, so my grades were always bad.

Being a total academic disaster with scary fighting skills made me the queen bee of Riverside High.

First time I saw him was on this rainy day. I burst through the school gates totally soaked and still ended up three minutes late.

He was working the hall monitor station, raindrops on his lashes, about to write my name in the detention book.

""Don't,"" I panted. ""Just finished the night shift at 7-Eleven.""

He looked up and saw my dark circles, the bu//rn mark on my hand, coffee stains on my uniform pants—his pen hesitated.

That day, he didn't write me up.

Senior year study groups threw us together, and we actually started connecting.

He was ridiculously patient, even if his mouth was pure poison sometimes.

The other girls were shooting daggers at me, but nobody dared mess with me directly—perks of being the scary girl. They just spread nasty rumors behind my back.

But Cameron never distanced himself from me.

That's when I fell for him. Hard.

It wasn't until our class reunion a year after graduation that I realized even ice-cold Cameron Reid had feelings for someone.

Outside the karaoke room, I heard him confessing to Aria Sterling, our school's It Girl. But she didn't give him an answer.

Cameron looked crushed and downed way too many drinks.

Someone had spiked his drink with something sketchy, and he was so out of it he grabbed my hand thinking I was Aria.

I couldn't resist seeing my untouchable crush all flushed and desperate like that. Only hesitated for a second before we ended up tangled together in another private room all night.

But honestly? I didn't feel good about it. All I remember is one word: PAIN.

Next morning, I woke up before him.

They say when you give your first time to someone you love, you can actually hear flowers blooming in your heart.

I wasn't gonna make him take responsibility—planned to just ghost. But when I tried to get up, the movement pulled at my... injuries down there, and I crashed to the floor, waking up sleeping beauty.

Cameron took in the scene and put two and two together.

He stared at that red stain on the sheets, then said something that sent me straight from heaven to the depths of he//ll:

""Wow, your reconstruction surgery looks legit. Almost fooled me.""

I forced myself to laugh. ""Yeah, found a good doctor. Super cheap too.""

""That's not what I meant, I…""

He tried to explain, but I wasn't listening—threw on my clothes and bolted.

I was so pissed and heartbroken, I forgot to take the morning-after pill.

Three months after that, I'd been working myself to death trying to forget the whole humiliating mess.

Later, I collapsed from exhaustion and ended up in the hospital where they found out I was pregnant—Aria's little sidekick Riley Walsh posted the pics in our group chat.

Cameron and I hadn't talked privately since that night, so his public reply totally blindsided me.

Next day, Cameron showed up at my door with his mom.

Cameron had his usual poker face—impossible to read what he was thinking.

Mrs. Reid, on the other hand, was all business—asking my age, what my parents did for work.

When I told her I didn't have a father and my mom was on dialysis for kid//ney failure, she just said, ""Poor child,"" like she was talking about the weather.

""The Reid family has only had one heir per generation for three generations. We can't abandon the baby in your womb. Name your price.""

Classic ""keep the baby, ditch the mom"" move.

I asked them to transfer my mom to the Reid family hospital and promise to find her a donor, covering all medical costs.

Mrs. Reid agreed, and we signed a contract promising I'd cut all ties with the Reid family after giving birth.

I went to the hospital to comfort mom, just telling her a nice classmate was helping us out.

She's always been pretty helpless—immediately broke down crying and tried to bow to the Reid family.

After leaving the hospital, they brought me to the Reid house.

Cameron didn't say a single word the whole time, acting like he wanted nothing to do with me.

I knew he couldn't stand me.

After Mrs. Reid left and Mr. Reid was away on business, Cameron got stuck with figuring out where I'd sleep.

He didn't give me my own room, didn't even give me a servant's room. Just told me to sleep on his bedroom floor.

Rich people's spare blankets are pretty soft though—more comfortable than my old wooden bed at home.

When he saw me sleeping peacefully the next morning, he actually showed emotion for once—his mouth twisted into this disgusted sneer.

""Typical street rat. Can sleep anywhere.""

The Reids made me quit all my jobs—bad for the baby and all.

So I helped their housekeeper with whatever I could manage.

While organizing Cameron's study, I found a framed photo of Aria on his desk—her in an evening gown playing piano, looking absolutely stunning.

Cameron snatched the frame away. ""Who said you could touch that?!""

First time I'd ever seen him lose his cool like that.

He must really, REALLY love her, I thought bitterly.

After that, Cameron started making my life he//ll on purpose.

Breakfast porridge was either too hot or too cold—kept making me adjust the temperature over and over.

If I turned over even slightly at night, he'd snap at me, then force me to get up and read to him until he fell asleep.

One afternoon while I was mopping, he accidentally spilled coffee on the floor and watched me clean it up again.

""Can't even mop properly. No wonder you can only survive by sleeping with men.""

When I just silently did what he wanted, he got frustrated and ran his hands through his hair.

""Sage, why don't you ever get MAD?""

I looked down, then back up with tears filling my eyes.

""I'm the one reaching above my station here. If it wasn't for that night, your life would never have been disrupted by someone like me...""

Cameron's breathing hitched. After a long pause, he said angrily, ""Don't cry. And don't look at me like that.""

Then he practically ran away, leaving me totally confused.

I don't really have the right to hate him. I mean, I was using him, and besides—

I chose the Reids as my meal ticket after weighing my options when someone else made me an offer.

The guy pushing me around in that group chat photo was a bodyguard sent by my biological father, taking me to get a DNA test.

He wasn't actually shoving me—just pushing me out of the way of some motorcycle speeding down the street.

Sounds like something out of a novel, but my bio dad turned out to be some crime boss who screwed around too much in his youth and wrecked his body.

As his only kid, he tracked me down wanting to take me in, but refused to help my mom.

I was originally planning to go the ""take over the criminal empire then save mom"" route, but mom's body couldn't wait that long.

My night with Cameron was an accident, but it definitely gave me a better option.

Compared to my random crime boss father, a respectable academic family like the Reids was way more reliable.

Plus, I could tell Cameron was softening toward me.

He'd force me to rest when I'd been doing housework too long, claiming pregnant women shouldn't overwork themselves.

He'd bring me perfectly temperature lemon water when I had morning sickness.

Later, he used ""worried you'll roll over on the baby"" as an excuse to make me share his bed, wrapping his arms around my bump every night.

Guy's got raging hormones—I felt him getting hard against my back several times and suggested separate beds.

But he always refused:

""No way. You toss and turn too much—you'll hurt the baby!""

""But you're... poking me. It's uncomfortable..."" I said weakly.

He jumped up and disappeared into the bathroom forever, coming back all steamy just as I was dozing off, pulling me close again and saying matter-of-factly: ""Sleep!""

I'd pass out completely, never knowing he made several more bathroom trips throughout the night.

I thought he was starting to care about me, but I quickly learned that his tiny bit of concern meant nothing compared to Aria.

The day Aria came to the Reid house, it was drizzling.

Mrs. Reid held her hand on the couch, chatting warmly.

Cameron sat next to her, his expression so gentle.

I was in the kitchen helping prep vegetables, watching this perfect family scene, thinking they looked like they actually belonged together.

During lunch, Mrs. Reid had me serve the dishes.

Watching me bustling around, Aria suddenly smiled and said, ""Mrs. Reid, isn't Sage practically Mrs. Reid? Why are you making her do servant work?""

Mrs. Reid glanced at me dismissively. ""What Mrs. Reid? She should be grateful we're even accepting her illegitimate child. You and Cameron grew up together—you're the only one worthy of being my daughter-in-law. Right, Cameron?""

""Yeah.""

Getting Cameron's immediate ""yeah,"" Aria looked absolutely thrilled.

""But Mrs. Reid, are you sure the baby is really Cameron's? I mean, kids at school always said Sage worked as an escort to make money. Several guys from her neighborhood have been with her...""

""WHAT?!"" Mrs. Reid was so pissed she threw down her fork and immediately called for a doctor to test the amniotic fluid.

""So young and already such a s//lut. Hope she doesn't have any diseases—what a disaster!""

I just stood there listening to Mrs. Reid's insults, then looked at Cameron.

He put down his fork but didn't say anything, just gave Aria this weird look.

I bit my lip hard, forcing myself to stay calm.

It was just a DNA test. I knew the answer—I wasn't scared.

Thinking about mom in the hospital, and how Cameron told me last night they'd found a suitable donor and surgery would be scheduled soon, I couldn't afford to piss them off.

The doctor arrived quickly.

Mrs. Reid had someone hold down my arm while they drew blood.

When the needle went in, I instinctively flinched.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Cameron's expression darken.

After all that, Mrs. Reid waved me away dismissively.

""If you're lying to me, I'll make sure you learn what 'nowhere to run' means.""

Aria gently patted Cameron's shoulder.

""Poor Cameron, getting trapped by this shameless girl.""

But Cameron didn't back her up—just watched me head upstairs.

I figured Cameron would kick me out of his bed, so I started packing my stuff when I got back to the room.

He came in soon after.

""What are you doing?""

""Packing? You probably want me gone, right?""

""You...""

He couldn't get a complete sentence out.

Mrs. Reid came upstairs too, worried. Seeing the situation, she frowned. ""You two slept together AGAIN?""

""No, we just..."" Sleep in the same bed?

Nobody would believe that explanation.

Seeing me stammer, Mrs. Reid lost it and slapped me.

""You trashy girls only know how to seduce men?!""

""Mom...""

Cameron tried to defend me, but Aria, who'd followed us upstairs, interrupted:

""Mrs. Reid, don't get upset. Men and women alone together naturally leads to... complications. Why don't you separate them? It's better for the baby too.""

Mrs. Reid considered Aria's suggestion.

I panicked.

""Mrs. Reid, what about my mom's medical bills...""

Mrs. Reid looked disgusted. ""Don't worry, we'll honor our agreement. But only if that baby is actually ours. If you're lying to me, you DON'T want to know what happens next!""

She immediately had the servants help me pack and ship me off to the Reid family's place in the Hamptons.

After handling all this, she led Cameron and Aria away.

I didn't have much—just filled one big suitcase.

I was dragging it to the staircase when I found Aria standing there, arms crossed, her fake sweetness completely gone.

Her first words dripped with pure malice: ""Never thought that spiked drink would end up benefiting a little bi//tch like you!""

""What do you mean?""

""I lost a bet with my friend, so I was supposed to give her Cameron for one night,"" she said casually. ""But I never expected Cameron to actually care about you. Can't figure out what's appealing about you. You that good in bed?""

Hearing her talk about Cameron so carelessly made me mad for some reason.

Seeing my anger, she looked satisfied.

""What's wrong? Mad I insulted you, or jealous that Cameron belongs to ME?"" She leaned close to my ear and whispered, ""Let me show you exactly how far Cameron will go for me.""

With that, she smiled maliciously, then screamed and threw herself down the stairs.

I didn't even have time to react before Cameron was rushing upstairs, frantically helping Aria up.

He carefully checked her over, speaking gently to comfort her. After confirming she was okay, he glared at me like I was the villain.

""Sage, are you INSANE?! If something happened to Aria, I would never forgive you! Apologize to her RIGHT NOW!""

I didn't do it, so I won't apologize.

I dragged my suitcase down the stairs. When I passed them, Cameron grabbed my arm hard. ""APOLOGIZE!""

""She fell down by herself."" I stared right at him.

Cameron laughed bitterly. ""How can you be so vicious? Won't apologize?"" 

He pressed down on my shoulders, forcing me to kneel. ""Apologize to her, or I'll have the hospital stop treating your mother.""

I looked up at him in disbelief, but only saw disgust in his eyes.

I lowered my head as tears fell, whispering ""sorry.""

Aria ignored me, just said in a pitiful voice, ""Cameron, my leg really hurts...""

Cameron immediately picked her up and rushed upstairs, yelling at me as he left: ""GET OUT!""

Less than three days after that, Mrs. Reid showed up with the DNA results.

I'd barely opened the door when she slapped me across the face.

""Look at these results yourself!""

I held my stinging cheek and stared at the report in confusion:

[Paternity Probability: 0.0001%]

""Impossible!"" I looked up sharply. ""This report is WRONG!""

Mrs. Reid laughed coldly and snatched the report back. ""Evidence doesn't lie! Your mother's medical support ends TODAY!""

Then she gestured to her bodyguards. ""Throw her out!""

The guards roughly shoved me out the door and threw my suitcase after me, my belongings scattered everywhere.

Meanwhile, mom's condition was getting worse.

The doctor looked grim. ""Kid//ney failure caused heart problems. She needs a transplant immediately. But you pissed off the Reids—they've blacklisted you from every hospital in the city. I'm sorry...""

Seeing mom with tubes in both arms, I bit my lip and dialed Cameron's number.

I remembered Mrs. Reid's final warning not to contact Cameron.

But I was out of options. If I could just explain everything to him, maybe he'd help me out of pity?

Ring... ring...

The phone rang and rang.

My heart clenched tighter with each tone.

Finally, someone picked up.

But it was Aria, breathing hard: ""Hello... mmm... who is it...""

My throat closed up completely.

Why was Aria answering Cameron's phone?

What were they DOING?

Before I could process it, Cameron took the phone, also breathing heavily. ""Yeah... who's this?""

I hung up immediately, feeling completely crushed.

Desperate, I called my bio father:

""That offer you made about joining the Vaughn family—I told you I'd only do it if you save my mother...""

""If you don't agree, you're gonna see my corpse real soon, and then you'll have NO heir left in this world. I mean it!""",1,1753536738.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

# Best Chocolate milk Bottle 2025: Top brands Reviewed

The quest for the perfect chocolate milk experience begins with the bottle itself. It's not just about the appetizing liquid inside; the container plays a crucial role in maintaining freshness, convenience, and overall enjoyment. From reusable glass options to eco-kind alternatives and innovative designs, the market offers a diverse array of chocolate milk bottles. In 2025,consumers are increasingly seeking bottles that prioritize sustainability,functionality,and aesthetics. This review dives into the top brands, analyzing their key features, benefits, and drawbacks to help you choose the best chocolate milk bottle for your needs.

## Key Features Analysis

The best chocolate milk bottles of 2025 showcase several key features designed to enhance the consumer experience. These features range from material composition and sealing mechanisms to ergonomic designs and temperature retention capabilities.

**Material Composition:**

the most popular chocolate milk bottles utilize a variety of materials, each with its own set of advantages. Glass remains a favored option for its purity and recyclability. Many premium brands employ borosilicate glass, known for its superior durability and resistance to thermal shock. Plastic bottles, usually made from BPA-free Tritan or similar materials, offer a lightweight and shatter-resistant alternative. Stainless steel is gaining traction for its temperature retention properties and long-lasting nature. The choice of material considerably impacts the bottle's weight, durability, and ability to preserve the milk's freshness.

**Sealing Mechanism:**

An effective sealing mechanism is crucial to prevent leaks and maintain the integrity of the chocolate milk. Screw-top lids with silicone gaskets are a common and reliable choice,providing a tight seal to avoid spills.Flip-top lids offer convenient one-handed operation, frequently enough featuring a locking mechanism to prevent accidental opening. Some innovative bottles incorporate magnetic closures for enhanced ease of use and a sleek aesthetic. The seal's quality directly affects the bottle's ability to transport milk without leakage and prevent spoilage due to air exposure.

**Ergonomic Design:**

The shape and design of the bottle influence its ease of handling and overall user experience.Bottles with contoured shapes or textured grips provide a secure hold, preventing accidental drops. Wide-mouth openings facilitate easy filling and cleaning, while narrow necks can help regulate the flow of milk during drinking. Many bottles incorporate measurement markings, allowing for precise portion control.An ergonomic design can enhance comfort and convenience,especially for children and individuals with limited hand strength.

**Temperature Retention:**

For those who enjoy their chocolate milk cold, temperature retention is a notable factor. Insulated bottles, typically constructed from double-walled stainless steel, can keep milk cold for several hours. These bottles utilize vacuum insulation to minimize heat transfer, preserving the milk's refreshing temperature. Some models even come with integrated ice packs for extended cooling. the ability to maintain the milk's temperature can greatly enhance the drinking experience, especially during outdoor activities or travel.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**

A chocolate milk bottle's ease of cleaning is vital for maintaining hygiene and preventing bacterial growth. Bottles with wide-mouth openings are generally easier to clean with a bottle brush. Dishwasher-safe materials simplify the cleaning process, saving time and effort. Some bottles feature removable components,allowing for thorough cleaning of hard-to-reach areas. Proper cleaning and maintenance are essential to ensure the bottle's longevity and prevent the build-up of odors and residues.

**Durability and Longevity:**

The lifespan of a chocolate milk bottle is determined by its construction and the quality of its materials. Bottles made from durable materials like borosilicate glass or stainless steel are less prone to breakage and can withstand daily use. Reinforced seams and robust lid designs contribute to the bottle's overall durability. Investing in a high-quality bottle ensures a longer lifespan, reducing the need for frequent replacements and minimizing environmental impact.

## Core Benefits

the best chocolate milk bottles offer benefits beyond simply holding liquid. they contribute to a healthier, more convenient, and enjoyable drinking experience.

**Enhanced Freshness:** By using airtight seals and sometimes insulated materials, these bottles keep chocolate milk fresher for longer. This is particularly beneficial for those who prepare their chocolate milk in advance or transport it for later consumption. The reduced exposure to air and temperature fluctuations helps preserve the milk's flavor and nutritional value.**Improved Convenience:** Ergonomic designs and easy-to-clean features make these bottles incredibly convenient for daily use. Wide-mouth openings allow for quick and hassle-free filling, while dishwasher-safe materials simplify the cleaning process. For busy parents and individuals on the go,these features save valuable time and effort.

**Reduced Environmental Impact:** Choosing reusable chocolate milk bottles over disposable options significantly reduces waste. Glass and stainless steel bottles are highly recyclable, while BPA-free plastic bottles offer a more sustainable alternative to single-use plastic.By opting for reusable bottles, consumers can contribute to a more environmentally conscious lifestyle.

**Healthier Drinking Experience:** High-quality materials, such as BPA-free plastic and borosilicate glass, ensure a safer drinking experience. These materials prevent the leaching of harmful chemicals into the milk, preserving its purity and taste. The absence of BPA and other toxins promotes overall health and well-being.

**Cost Savings:** While the initial investment in a reusable chocolate milk bottle might potentially be higher than purchasing disposable containers, it proves more economical in the long run. By eliminating the need to constantly buy single-use bottles or cartons, consumers can save money over time. A durable, reusable bottle represents a sustainable and cost-effective solution.

## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions about the suitability, care, and compatibility of chocolate milk bottles. Here are some common queries and their answers.

**Are these bottles suitable for hot chocolate milk?**
It depends on the material.Glass and stainless-steel bottles are generally suitable for both hot and cold liquids, especially if they are made from borosilicate glass or feature double-walled insulation. However, plastic bottles may not be suitable for hot liquids, as high temperatures can cause them to leach chemicals or warp. Always check the manufacturer's instructions before using a bottle for hot chocolate milk.

**How do I properly clean and sanitize these bottles?**
For thorough cleaning, disassemble the components of the bottle, including the lid and any removable parts. Wash each piece with warm, soapy water and a bottle brush. Rinse thoroughly with clean water. To sanitize the bottle, you can boil it for a few minutes or use a dishwasher with a sanitizing cycle, if the bottle is dishwasher-safe. ensure all components are completely dry before reassembling the bottle.

**Can I use these bottles for other beverages besides chocolate milk?**
Yes, these bottles are versatile and can be used for a wide range of beverages, including water, juice, smoothies, and even coffee or tea. though, it's vital to clean the bottle thoroughly after each use to prevent the build-up of odors and flavors. Avoid using the same bottle for both dairy and non-dairy beverages without proper cleaning to prevent cross-contamination and bacterial growth.

**What should I look for in a chocolate milk bottle for a young child?**
When choosing a bottle for a young child, prioritize safety, ease of use, and durability. Look for bottles made from BPA-free, shatter-resistant materials like Tritan plastic or silicone. Choose a bottle with an ergonomic shape and easy-to-grip design for small hands. A leak-proof lid with a simple opening mechanism is also essential. additionally,consider bottles with age-appropriate designs and fun colors to encourage children to drink their milk.

I’ve posted here before, but things have gotten bad enough that I’m officially moving out. I followed my province’s regulations and my lease agreement by giving 60 days’ notice to my landlord. However, my roommate is now pressuring me to leave sooner than that.

I’m (21F) and have lived with my roommate (25F) for three years. Over time, any conflict between us was always met with her refusing to take accountability, which ultimately destroyed our friendship. On top of that, due to changes in my schooling and funding, I’ve had to make the difficult decision to move back home to save money.

When I gave my notice, she immediately called me selfish and disrespectful—saying I should have given a year’s notice (which isn’t required). I wish I could’ve planned that far ahead, but life happened.

Even before I made the decision to move out, she had started ignoring me—both in person and over messages. Since then, things have escalated: now she’s verbally attacking me and claiming I’m ""no longer welcome"" in the apartment because I’m taking the items I purchased.

To clarify, she only brought in the living room couches. I furnished almost everything else in the apartment myself. Anything we split 50/50, I’m leaving behind. I’ve been taking my things out gradually, and she’s been getting angrier with each item I remove—even though I made sure we had replacements in storage for everything except my coffee machine and my mom’s microwave (which I borrowed, and she wanted back anyway).

She hasn’t gotten physically aggressive, but she’s pushed my belongings in front of my bedroom door, cursed me out on multiple occasions in messages, and keeps repeating that I’m “not welcome and this is not your home” anymore and I need to leave as soon as possible —even though I’ve already paid rent for August. I know legally she cant but the stress of the situation is making my mental health worse, and I’m not sure how to move forward the next month. 

My main question:
Given the level of verbal harassment and the fact that I’m being pressured to leave before my paid time is up, is there any chance I could get a refund for my last month’s rent? I’ve documented everything she’s said via text. She refuses to reimburse me for me to leave sooner, but I don’t feel safe or welcome staying here much longer. She is not the landlord she is the tenant I signed the lease contract together with. ",1,1753536294.0,roommateproblems,4,1.0,False

Living in a smaller apartment can make owning full-sized appliances a bit of a luxury, but the ZENY Portable Mini Washing Machine B07MLWJZH7 delivers in a big way for those needing compact and practical laundry solutions. At just 21.06 x 13.39 x 21.06 inches and weighing 13 pounds, this unit fits neatly into tight corners; I’ve even tucked it into my RV storage without breaking a sweat. Its translucent blue tub is not only functional but also adds a little flair. For someone like me who’s always on the move, whether it be a weekend camping trip or a long-term RV journey, this washer has proven to be indispensable. It’s also an easy fit for urban spaces where every square inch matters.

[Check ZENY B07MLWJZH7 price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b07mlwjzh7/)

**Ease of Use Without the Learning Curve**

Operating the washer felt as straightforward as it gets. The intuitive knob controls make setup almost charmingly old-school—just fill it with clothes and water, twist the timer, and you’re off. The semi-automatic design with a spin basket is an advantageous feature for someone who enjoys the process continuing without babysitting the machine. However, one step requires supervision: the absence of an automatic water shut-off means you need to stand by during filling. I have to admit, the first time, I walked out to grab a coffee and returned to a puddled floor, which wasn’t my proudest moment!

**Performance That Surprises**

Efficiency is the name of the game here. The washing capacity of 8 pounds may not handle a thick comforter, but it’s perfect for everyday clothes or swimsuits after a beach day. The spin speed of 1300 RPM helps lighten the load of drying times significantly. My workout clothes, usually soaked from a high-intensity gym session, came out clean and nearly dry—incredible for such a small machine. Still, it does hum a bit noisily during the spin cycle, which can be noticeable if you’re living in a shared space. Nothing unmanageable but worth mentioning.

**Upsides**

- Compact size and lightweight design are perfect for small spaces and portability.
- Intuitive knob controls make it easy for even a non-tech-savvy person to operate.
- High efficiency with commendable cleaning power for its size.
- Dual washing and spinning functionality for added convenience.

**Caveats**

- No automatic water shut-off feature, requiring monitoring during filling.
- Spin cycle can get noisy, particularly in quiet environments.
- Gravity drain requires the machine to be placed above ground level for proper operation.

**Who Is It For?**

This handy washer is the ultimate ally for anyone living in a small space, constantly moving, or simply looking for an affordable and efficient alternative to laundromats. I could see this being a lifesaver for students in dorms or frequent travelers who take long trips but still want clean clothes on demand. If you’re someone looking for an additional washer for small loads alongside your regular one, this could complement your laundry arsenal well.

**Other Options in the Market**

The competition in portable washers is slowly heating up, with brands like Giantex and BLACK+DECKER offering comparable models. For instance, the Giantex counterpart features automatic water-shutoff and a slightly larger capacity at a higher price point, making it more convenient but less budget-friendly. On the other end, BLACK+DECKER opts for a fully automatic design, which is more beginner-friendly but compromises portability due to its heavier design. What I found sets the ZENY washer apart is its portability; few washers this efficient are this lightweight and easy to move.

**Affordable Quality**

From my perspective, the ZENY Portable Mini Washing Machine strikes a fine balance in terms of quality and cost. It’s not winning any awards for advanced features, but it doesn’t pretend to. It’s affordable, well-built, and does what it says it will—simplifying laundry for space-conscious individuals. Given the added portability and efficiency bonuses, I think its value proposition speaks for itself.

We hit it off and have pretty much been texting every day for the last two months. We've seen each other a couple of times at group gatherings, but I knew I’d eventually have to ask her out on a proper date. I’ve been tied up lately taking care of my sick dog, but now that he’s much better, I finally asked her to grab a coffee this weekend.

After I sent the invitation, she suddenly went completely silent for days. At first, I took it as a sign that she wasn’t interested, but I also got a bit worried that something might have happened. So I followed up this morning. She replied late at night, saying she’d been busy with work and apologized, saying it might be too late to respond to my invitation.

I’m not really sure how to feel about it. I understand people can get overwhelmed with work, but not replying for five days—especially when we've been texting daily—feels off. And only responding after I followed up makes it seem even more unusual.

I'm not sure if I can find what I'm looking for here but I'd like to try again. The first time I posted here it was just on a whim and got overwhelmed eventually, with everything feeling like an interview... I hope I can find something a bit more magical this time around!



I'm an INFP / introverted but I do like to talk about things I'm interested in and you're interested in. Hopefully you're not yet dead inside or more introverted than I am and can maintain conversations. ☺️

I live for cloudy days and love gloomy days. I prefer to go out in such days!

I like the typical introvert activities such as eating out, go roaming around malls, look inside bookstores, have some frappe while I have some music on. I'm not opposed to physical activities just not in the heat of the sun and in the water. I also like to have my alone time too, though, to recharge.

I open up rarely but--I'll be caring, vulnerable, playful, loyal, sweet and even flirty if I feel attracted and connected to you.

I'm quite allergic to fakeness. I value sincerity and vulnerability, and I know it takes a lot of courage to be both.

Also, please don’t bring your baggage, drama and mind games into my life. I am drama free and is pretty happy by myself and I'll choose my inner peace, always.

I'll only put in the same amount of effort you're giving when messaging me.

I lean more into spirituality nowadays. I don't subscribe to any religion. If you're looking for someone to bring to the altar and have a traditional relationship with, I'm telling you right now, I'm not that person. :(

I'm not into LDR / foreigners, sorry!

I love the French vanilla swirl so I decided to give them another try this morning. Big mistake. I drove 10 min to my local Duncan, ordered my normal frozen coffee w/ French vanilla swirl. I drove back home before I took my first sip,, dummy me wake up. 

I get back home, take a sip, there is no vanilla swirl at all, they forgot it. We’re human, we make mistakes but if it’s not a hot coffee ☕️ with nothing in it, they will mess it up. 

I call the store and they say to come back up they will remake it. I drove all the way back up, walk in and they haven’t made the coffee yet. Ok no problem smell it the missing vanilla aroma is obvious. They said no which is understandable. 

They remake the coffee. The manager hands it to me, with an angry look on her face. I went, picked up a straw, its half foam/froth. She must have blended it for far too long. There is no ice, it’s a melted over blended mess half of it is foam/froth. I can’t drink that unless I want a whole bunch of foam in my stomach. 

This is frustrating to start my morning out like this, I had to drive all the way back up due to their mistake of not putting vanilla swirl in the first one. Then the second one is half foam./froth. The way the manager looked at me with distain, was unsettling. I really enjoyed these coffees when they were consistent, and they didn’t miss ingredients, and when they didn’t overblend to a froth, and when it actually had ice in it.

In-Depth Review Inside!,"The Gevi DCMA0-BK0A1 Programmable Drip Coffee Maker became part of my daily routine, and I have a lot to say about it. I’ve been using it every morning, and as a coffee enthusiast, I couldn't help but put every feature to the test to see how it measures up. Over the past few weeks, I’ve brewed everything from classic roast to cold brews, tested its programmability, and explored its cleaning ease. Here’s my take on the good, the not-so-good, and everything in between.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek black finish makes this coffee maker blend seamlessly into my kitchen. It’s compact yet holds 12 cups in its glass carafe. I appreciated how it didn't dominate my counter space, but its design added a modern vibe. The touchscreen interface is an absolute joy to use. It's intuitive, and even my tech-shy mom figured it out in a snap. The inclusion of a permanent filter is another great touch. It’s environmentally friendly and saves me from constantly buying paper filters. Still, the appliance feels lightweight (it weighs about 7.48 pounds), which made me wonder about its long-term durability.

**Programmable Options and Ease of Use**  
Coffee-making feels delightfully futuristic with this machine. I set the Delay Brew Timer for my morning coffee, and waking up to the smell of a fresh brew is now a highlight of my day. The system for programming is straightforward. Pressing the ""Hour"" and ""Minute"" buttons lets you customize the brew time, and I didn’t encounter any confusion during the setup. However, I noticed that if you accidentally press the ""ON/OFF"" button while programming, it cancels your settings—which happened to me once. It’s a minor quirk but worth mentioning for users.

**Check Gevi DCMA0-BK0A1 price on Amazon.**  

**Brew Quality and Strength Options**  
This machine brews a fantastic cup of coffee! The adjustable strength settings—classic, intense, and rich—add diversity to my coffee routine. I enjoy a robust flavor on most days, but the option to customize has been great for guests who prefer something milder. The drip system expertly controls water flow, ensuring consistency in each brew. Whether I’m preparing coffee for one or for the entire family, quality doesn’t dip. Additionally, the iced coffee function is a fun addition. I tested it out during a warm weekend, and the results were refreshing and flavorful, though not very bold.

**Keep-Warm Plate and Auto Shut-Off**  
The keep-warm feature has been a lifesaver on more occasions than I can count. I set the timer for up to 4 hours on days I know I’ll be sipping slowly. The coffee stays pleasantly hot without that “burnt” taste I’ve experienced with older machines. Once it’s done, the auto shut-off kicks in, which is honestly a great safety feature. No more worrying if I forgot to turn it off before leaving the house.

**Pluses**  
- Touchscreen interface adds elegance and ease of use.  
- Programmable timer ensures freshly brewed coffee upon waking.  
- Consistent and customizable coffee strength settings.  
- Durable, permanent filter reduces paper waste.  

**Flaws in the Design**  
Despite its many strengths, not everything about this coffee maker is perfect. For one, the fixed water reservoir feels inconvenient when refilling. I found it awkward to pour water without spilling a bit. Another issue was cleanup. While the filter and carafe clean up easily with soap and water, the machine’s nooks can become tricky to reach. Also, when brewing in larger quantities, it seemed a tad slower than some other machines I’ve tested.

**Negatives**  
- Fixed water reservoir lacks flexibility.  
- Cleaning the inner parts could be easier.  
- Slightly slower brewing time for full 12-cup batches.  

**Peer Products**  
Comparing this coffee maker to competitors like the Ninja CE251 or the Cuisinart DCC-3200, it definitely holds its ground. While the Cuisinart offers more advanced programming, it doesn’t include an iced coffee function. The Ninja has a similar modern design, but I found its user interface slightly less intuitive than Gevi’s touchscreen. What gives this a leg up, though, is its 24-hour brew preset and reliable keep-warm plate. The competitors excel in other areas, but for a coffee machine that does a bit of everything, this one makes a compelling case.

**Price Worthiness**  
Considering all its features—programmable settings, touchscreen operation, and strengths for brewing iced or hot coffee—the Gevi DCMA0-BK0A1 offers good value for the money. It’s not the cheapest option out there, but what you’re paying for is convenience and versatility. It’s a great meal companion for coffee lovers who want flexibility without sacrificing quality. You might find tougher competition in higher-end models, but in this price range, it proves itself as an affordable yet premium-feeling appliance.

1m9sukn,https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1m9sukn/i_am_finally_hitting_my_stride_as_a_gs_civilian/,I am finally hitting my stride as a GS civilian,"It's been just over two years since I [got my DD 214](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/14zkzxd/whos_got_two_thumbs_and_a_signed_dd214/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and a year and a half since I took a GS job as the third attorney at a brigade. The first six months I was struggling to keep up; it's supposed to be a 6-person office (MAJ, CPT, me, E6, GS-9 paralegal, GS-7 tech) but for a while I was the only attorney with two civilian paralegals and then the tech quit, leaving just me and an awesome retired CW3.

Before I came on board, the BJA was running a solo shop herself for six months with the two civilian paralegals, so things got backlogged and things got missed. I asked for a continuity folder before she left, but there was a 1-week underlap between her leaving and me coming on board. I got a 2-hour office call with her before she left, which was better than nothing, and the two civilians and my cohorts at other brigades really helped me get me on my feet. But the first six months were still pretty rough. 

Still, when I had a call or message or email or visit with something hot, I'd drop everything to address the issue. Nothing was ""stuck at legal."" We got it, we acknowledged it, we triaged it to see if it was a today issue or later this week issue, and we worked it. If it got lost, we owned up, apologized, and worked it immediately.

Last summer, we got almost back to full manning, the only empty desk is the GS-7 legal tech that we just couldn't fill before the hiring freeze hit. But once the E6 and the two military attorneys learned the nuances of our practice, we started firing on all cylinders. Among the three attorneys, we have 40 years' experience in the office, 25 of which are mine.

With 18 months in the job, I feel like I am finally becoming the continuity/subject matter expert I was hired to be. I am not in charge unless the other two attorneys are out of the office, and that suits me just fine. But I help out with everything I can. 

And since I still have that first six month struggle in my head, I have started applying quiet (or sometimes not so quiet) pressure on our HQ to make changes that would benefit the organization.

Example: We have a weekly synch with all the (geographically dispersed) brigades and the higher legal office. While everyone at HQ had a paper tracker, the brigades did not have the same one, and it was briefed in no particular order. 

After a few meetings of briefing by ambush (Hey, X Brigade, what's the status of that one?), I started asking for the tracker to be posted so we weren't just staring at the video of the conference room and wondering when our turn in the barrel was. ""That's a good idea,"" responded the SJA. 

Next week, it was forgotten, so I politely asked again. Next week, again, and again politely reminded. 

I became the needy thorn until magically the tracker started coming out, ordered in a coherent fashion by brigade. It's not shared on screen in the call, like any other meeting would be, but at least I got the win.

I'm also pointing out other products that could be helpful but aren't. I'd actually pushed them a couple times but hadn't gotten traction. Now, we have a new OIC in the office that handles those at higher, and I will start pushing them again, politely, but harder.

I am also sitting back and identifying fixes so we can all better track actions within our brigade. No more ""Where's this investigation, who's doing the legal review"" - tracker covers soup to nuts all relevant dates, who briefed the investigator, who did the legal review, and includes a link to the investigation folder. And every single action I do is logged in our knowledge base - not just that I did action X, but here's the memo/email/legal review, with source documents and as many search terms as I can think of, so it's (1) redundant with our SharePoint and (2) can easily be found later through a keyword search so anyone can dust it off, check the references, and use it to solve similar issues that come up later.

The CPT has a case coming up, his first potential contested case in over a year. He just came from an active TC job, so he knows his shit, but it's been a minute and you always need a second set of eyes on this. His co-counsel (smart, but a brand-new trial counsel) and the SJA shop are 1,000 miles away, and the MAJ down the hall has more Reserve than active experience. But, good news! I have been a trial counsel, defense counsel, chief of justice, military justice instructor, and SJA. So he and I flit between our offices 

I had a pretty good rapport with all seven battalion commanders and the brigade leadership when I started, but when the new BJA came on board, I intentionally throttled back to let him take the lead and be the face of our office. But I'd still get calls. With this summer's PCS cycle, we have three new battalion commanders, and I find that increasingly they are coming to me with their phone calls for ""real quick questions."" The BJA takes lead on all of our battalion synchs. This tells me that the outgoing commander or someone made a point to say, hey, the legal shop is good, but Mr. hzoi is always available to help.

I'm also just improving my foxhole to make the office a better place to work. In the old shop, we had an open bay for 2 attorneys and 2 paralegals, with an office for the BJA. My first six months, I squatted in the vacant BJA office, but then I was riding a tiny cubicle for the next 9 months or so. We finally moved this spring to a bigger building. It has its problems, but I have my own office with a window at last. 

I slowly moved all the coins and ""I love me"" plaques in, as well as fun tchotchkes from my career. Boss didn't let me keep the CSZ and Enfield bayonets (some garbage about ""illegal on post,"" yadda yadda yadda) but has otherwise left me free reign. Added an essential oil diffuser, which is relaxing as shit without violating fire codes or making the office overly cloying. Made subtly funny door signs for my office and others. Brought in things from home we're not using and scavenged furniture to turn an empty, unused room into a lounge. The pathetic office plant that was just scraping by under fluorescent tube lighting in our last office has tripled in size in my window.

I get away with the occasional goofy shirt because I have become so value-added to the job that my little quirks are overlooked. I wear slacks, dress shoes, and a collared shirt, but I keep slightly pushing the envelope. Yesterday? Blue polo with pink flamingos on it. Day before that? Light purple polo with trash pandas doing silly things. But I know my shit, so people grin, say ""nice shirt,"" and then ask me to help fix their problem.

The outgoing brigade DCO gave me some great feedback on her way out. I was briefing her replacement, and she spoke up at the end and said, basically, any time you have a question, call hzoi. I gave her an aw, shucks response. She turned and looked at me and said, ""I know you're trying to be humble. But I hear feedback from every battalion about everyone here at brigade. Yours is the only name everyone says with a smile on their face.""

Also got what I think is the best compliment from my HHC commander this week, who I often work with on the odd taskings that usually get dumped on him. We were bullshitting about something, and I said I was finally feeling like I was good at my job. He grinned and said, ""We were talking about you the other day. You're like a CW4 in the shadows. Everybody will be struggling to fix something, and you come out of the shadows holding a cup of coffee, tell us how to fix it, and then fade back to whatever you were doing.""

The icing on the cake was yesterday, when one of my outgoing company commanders asked me to get together with her and her incoming replacement. I gave the 30,000 foot view of the typical legal issues he's going to see and how we're going to help him through them. We had a good talk, the old commander jumped in with things she wished she'd known, and I managed to keep things on topic and not break into too many war stories. At the end of the call, the new commander asked if he could have my cell phone. I grinned, and said, ""No. Sorry. LTC hzoi would have happily given you his, but Mr. hzoi goes home at 1630 unless overtime is authorized. But here's the BJA's government cell for emergencies.""

Life is good.

TL;DR - firing on all four cylinders at my job and have become the wise old man on staff that I was hired to be, actually practicing law again instead of watching others do it, life is good.

1m9sue3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m9sue3/could_the_presto_2822_percolator_be_your_perfect/,Could the Presto 2822 Percolator Be Your Perfect Coffee Maker? Review Inside!,"The Presto 02822 6-Cup Stainless-Steel Coffee Percolator has been a fascinating addition to my daily coffee routine. From its sleek stainless-steel design to its functionality, it manages to combine simplicity with a touch of nostalgia. As someone who wakes up craving a perfectly brewed cup of coffee, this percolator quickly bridged the gap between my caffeine dreams and reality. However, as with any product, there are a few points to consider, even though my overall experience has been quite positive.

**Sleek and Compact Design**  
The first thing that struck me about this coffee percolator was its elegant stainless-steel construction. It exudes a sense of durability while maintaining a classic aesthetic that fits perfectly in my kitchen. Its compact size, measuring approximately 7.5 inches tall, fits easily on any counter space without crowding my other appliances. Despite its petite look, the percolator brews between two to six cups, making it versatile for both solo sippers like me and occasional guests.

**Ease of Use and Operation**  
Using this percolator is surprisingly straightforward. With a manual operation mode and a simple button interface, there aren’t any overwhelming features to learn. I like that I don’t have to fiddle with digital screens or programs early in the morning. The reusable filter is another highlight—environmentally friendly and simple to clean. It's also equipped with a cool-touch knob, handle, and a stay-cool bottom that saves me from accidental burns—a welcome feature as I’ve had my fair share of kitchen mishaps.

**Brewing Capability and Performance**  
The percolator’s 500-watt power impressed me. It brews coffee quickly while maintaining the rich flavor profile of the beans. The perking process, which involves circulating hot water through the coffee grounds, makes that delightful percolating sound, adding a nostalgic charm to my mornings. That ready-to-serve indicator light has saved my impatient self from prematurely pouring coffee too many times to count, ensuring I always get a perfectly brewed cup. Once the brewing is done, the automatic keep-warm mode keeps my coffee at the perfect temperature—a feature that made my life immensely easier during busy work-from-home mornings.

[Grab Presto 2822 at the best price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b002lvuik8/)

**Benefits**  
I’ve found this percolator’s key attributes to be beneficial in daily use:  
- Stainless-steel finish adds durability and style.  
- Compact and lightweight design fits even the smallest kitchens.  
- Brews coffee quickly and evenly for rich, robust flavors.  
- Cool-touch handle and base ensure safety during use.  

**Limitations**  
Nothing is perfect, and I must point out a few areas where this percolator didn’t fully meet my expectations:  
- The brewing process can be a bit noisy, especially during the initial perking stage.  
- Cleaning the spout thoroughly requires more effort since smaller particles tend to accumulate there.  
- Lack of programmable settings might be limiting for those who like automation in their coffee-making rituals.  

**Other Options**  
Comparing this percolator with other coffee makers I’ve tried, such as drip coffee machines and pod-based systems, revealed some interesting contrasts. Drip machines are usually quieter and offer larger brewing capacities, making them ideal for bigger households. However, they lack the rich, robust flavor that this percolator produces. Pod-based systems have the convenience edge but also generate more waste, turning me off as someone mindful of sustainability. The main competitor for me would be the Farberware Classic Stainless-Steel Percolator, which shares similar durability and style but struggles with heat retention once brewing is complete. In contrast, the automatic keep-warm mode of the Presto percolator gives it the edge for delivering consistently hot cups of coffee.

**Worth Every Penny**  
In terms of quality and functionality, I find the Presto coffee percolator to be a great mid-range option for coffee enthusiasts who want to marry simplicity with nostalgia. It doesn’t try to be an all-in-one, tech-packed device, which is part of its charm. If you’re seeking a durable, no-fuss solution for brewing smaller batches of coffee, this product aligns well with those priorities.

*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of titans in the MLS: the Chicago Fire, led by their Belgian blazer Hugo Cuypers (13 goals, because 13 is just “goals” in hieroglyphics), take on the New York Red Bulls, whose Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting has also scored 13 times this season—enough to fill a baker’s dozen of hat tricks if he really tried. The stakes? Pride, points, and the eternal question: *Can a team named after a beverage (Fire) out-sizzle a team named after a beverage (Red Bulls)?* Spoiler: Only one will quench your thirst for victory.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Mathematically Sound Case for Chaos

Let’s crunch the numbers like a defender crunching a watermelon on the sideline. The Fire are the clear favorites here, with decimal odds hovering around **1.83-1.87** (implying a **53.5%-55.6% chance to win**). The Red Bulls? They’re the “dark horse” if your definition of “dark” includes a 5-1 loss to Inter Miami last week. Their odds of **3.75-3.9** suggest a **26.7%-28% win probability**, while the draw sits at **4.0-4.1** (24.4%-25%).

The spread? Chicago is favored by **-0.5 goals**, meaning they’re expected to win outright—no draws allowed!—while the total goals line is set at **3.0**. Over/under odds are nearly even, but some books slightly favor the under (**1.87-1.95**), implying a gritty, low-scoring battle. If you’re betting on “under,” bring a thermos of coffee; if you’re going “over,” bring a defibrillator for your heart.

### News Digest: Injuries, Momentum, and Metaphors

The Fire are riding high after a **2-0 win over CF Montreal**, which is about as shocking as a toaster catching fire. Their defense, however, isn’t the leaky sieve it used to be—thanks to Cuypers’ midfield wizardry and a newfound commitment to not tripping over their own shoelaces (a problem that plagued them in 2023).

The Red Bulls? They’re coming off a \*\*

**TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 160**

When I go shopping I look at the prices and if I need what I see, I buy it and pay. Now that I am supposed to be in rehabilitation, I have to straighten out my life. When I go to a meeting, I take a coffee with sugar and milk, sometimes more than one. But at the collection time, I am either too busy to take money out of my purse, or I do not have enough, but I am there because I <i>need</i> this meeting. I heard someone suggest dropping the price of a beer into the basket, and I thought, that's too much! I almost never give one dollar. Like many others, I rely on the more generous members to finance the Fellowship. I forget that it takes money to rent the meeting room, buy my milk, sugar and cups. I will pay, without hesitation, ninety cents for a cup of coffee at a restaurant after the meeting; I always have money for that. So, how much is my sobriety and my inner peace worth?

1m9squf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/1m9squf/is_sensoryspecific_satiety_a_driver_of_the/,"Is sensory-specific satiety a driver of the popularity of very low-fat, very low-carb, and other restrictive fad diets for obesity?","Restrictive fad diets remain popular despite limited support from the scientific nutrition community. They are often promoted for weight loss or for conditions in which weight loss is the primary treatment: prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, PCOS, insulin resistance, MASLD, etc.

Rolls et al. conducted experiments in the 1980s showing that an ad libitum four-course meal with sausages, bread and butter, chocolate dessert, and bananas led to a 60% higher energy intake compared to four-course meals consisting of the same food repeated four times ([Rolls et al., 1984](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666384800069)). This reduction in appetite after consuming similar foods repeatedly is due to sensory-specific satiety, which implies that foods with similar sensory characteristics (savoriness, sweetness, aroma, mouthfeel, etc.) will be less appetizing compared to foods with varied sensory characteristics. The effect is so significant that even eating favorite foods over and over again leads to lower energy intake compared to meals with greater variety but less preferred foods ([Rolls et al., 1981](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0031938481900147)). Metabolic ward studies in recently weaned infants support the idea that a preference for sensory variety is present from infancy ([Davis, 1939](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20321464/)). This suggests that sensory-specific satiety is potentially an adaptive trait, evolved to ensure adequate nutrient variety in an omnivorous species.

Since a balanced diet is a cornerstone of adequate vitamin, mineral, and phytonutrient intake, it's clear why such diets are disfavored by the scientific community as treatments for obesity. However, there is still demand for these diets, as they can make weight management more achievable and enjoyable. These fad diets often allow frequent consumption of favorite foods while still enabling rapid weight loss. With this in mind, consider a few examples of how these diets are marketed to the public:

*You don’t have to count calories or control your portion sizes in order to gain full control of your health and reach your ideal body weight. We know this may sound crazy, but we sincerely mean it when we say that you can eat carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfaction.* \- Khambatta & Barbaro, 2020, about a very low-fat diet.

*Imagine losing weight with a diet that lets you have bacon and eggs for breakfast, heavy cream in your coffee, plenty of meat, and even salad with dressing for lunch and dinner! No wonder Dr. Atkins calls it a “diet revolution.”* \- Atkins, 1972, about a restrictive very low-carb diet.

*When you mix too many foods from the different food groups together (the proteins, the carbohydrates, the fats) — your basic balanced meal — you confuse the enzymes, and this prompts weight gain.* \- Judy Mazel, 1981, describing another fad diet exploiting sensory-specific satiety.

A common theme among all of these diets is the rejection of the fact that energy balance determines weight change. Instead, various pseudoscientific theories are offered to support the supposed mechanisms of these diets. Common themes involve insulin, leptin, ghrelin, cortisol, enzymes, and so on. Sensory-specific satiety doesn’t involve hormonal or enzymatic mechanisms, but rather regulation of feeding behavior via the central nervous system ([O’Doherty et al., 2000](https://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/abstract/2000/03200/sensory_specific_satiety_related_olfactory.46.aspx)). This results in a strong reduction in energy intake.

Finally, there are some rare medical conditions that truly require radical dietary restriction. Examples include maple syrup urine disease, familial chylomicronemia, GLUT1 deficiency, and others. I emphasize that these conditions are in a separate class and have very different motivations for initiating restrictive diets compared to obesity and its comorbidities. Like obesity, I speculate that irritable bowel syndrome is another nonserious condition which can prompt fad diets. I plan to write a separate post later.

So you, at last get up and leave, the shopkeeper still healing the man, look almost like a normal human person but you don't notice that and instead you head down the steps and go outside.

You think about where BUX could be I mean there is definitely more in the city but where else? and then you look at the wooden planks blocking the way of the bridge and still seeing the kid crying but he looks like he's a lot less sad about it and more acceptance for his problem but you don't care about that you care about what can be behind those planks?

Could it be a lot more BUX's? maybe more TIX's? hell maybe more weapons that can make you wayyyy more stronger then you are before? Your GREED covers you from reality, just making what behind wooden planks into your personal dream.

But at the last second, you snap out of it, realizing that ""why would there be money in the seemingly forest behind the planks?"" and "" what the fuck was that?"" but that doesn't matter right now, after all YOU said to repress then in the back of your mind. 

So, still looking for money, you head out to the city still very tired from running you just resort to walking and after a good 30 minutes you reach the city somehow still tired even from walking (you really need to eat a apple sometimes) and you notice something that you never noticed because you just been focus on the mission.

You notice a bar right next to the j#b station and feeling a little bit dumb that you haven't noticed this before and a little hungry walk on in, and immediately fall down the steps not noticing the steps where even there and taking 2 HP off of you (8/10 HP left) and after that, a guy dress in blue (your guessing he's the security guard or something like that) tries to help you up ""You okay?"" he says ""yeah I'm good I been though worse"" ""you sure I mean you got 2 HP taking off of you bro?"" ""I'm good"".

He helps you up and ask if need help getting down the rest of the steps but you decline and he backs off, letting you see the bar and once was down out by pain was quickly heading onto your ears and YOU notice 3 things.

1. a food stand of which you restock of food.

2. A coffee stand that you can see and can get more types of things

3. A BUX on the very top of the stage that you can get but need to be very stealthy to get at all.

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t.

Every muscle screamed—RUN—but I just stood there, frozen. Like an idiot wax figure in a haunted diorama.

Because he was here.

The Night Manager.

He didn’t just look at me. He peeled me apart with his eyes—slow, meticulous, clinical. Like a frog in a high school lab he couldn’t wait to slice open. I didn’t move. Not out of courage. Just the kind of primal instinct that tells you not to twitch while something ancient and awful decides if you’re prey or plaything.

He tilted his head—not like a person, but like a crow picking over roadkill.

“Phase Two,” he said, “is not a punishment.” Great.

“Though if you prefer punishment,” he added, “that can be arranged.”

His voice was polished, sure—but empty. Like someone programmed a seduction algorithm and forgot to add a soul. “It’s an adjustment,” he continued. “A clarification of expectations. An opportunity.”

That last word made the old man flinch. And honestly? Good. Nice to know I wasn’t the only one whose stomach turned at the sound of him talking like a recruiter for a cult.

The Night Manager turned toward him, slow, and smiled wider.

“You remain curious.” He said it like it was a defect that needed fixing. The old man stayed silent. Maybe he wasn’t even supposed to be here—but right now, I was glad he was. Anything was better than being left alone with this thing.

Then those unnatural eyes locked on me. His grin aimed for human and missed by miles. “You’re adapting. Not thriving, of course—but surviving.”

Well, thank you for noticing, eldritch boss man. I do try.

Then—he moved. Or didn’t. I don’t know. There was just less space. “I evaluate personnel personally when they make it this far,” he said. “Five more nights, and then we begin your final review.” A performance review. Wonderful.

His grin stretched just a bit too far. Perfect teeth. The kind of smile you'd see in an ad for dental work… or on a predator pretending to be human.

“Most don’t make it this far,” he said, voice light now, like this was some casual lunch meeting. “Still, you’re not quite what I expected. But then again, you’re human—blinking, sleeping, feeling. Inefficient. But adorable.”

I spoke before I could stop myself. “You call us inefficient, but you spend a lot of time pretending to be one of us. For someone above it all, you seem… invested.”

Something flickered behind his eyes—not anger. Amusement. “Oh,” he purred. “A sense of humor. Careful. That tends to draw attention.”

He smiled again.

“Especially mine.”

Ew.

He stepped closer. “If you’re very good, and very quiet, and just a little clever…” His voice dripped syrup. “You might earn something special.” His grin stretched wider, skin bending wrong. “Something permanent.” From his jacket, he placed a black card on the shelf as if it might bite.

**Night Supervisor Candidate – Pending Review**

My heart stuttered.

“I’m not interested,” I said. My voice shook, pathetic but honest.

He leaned close enough to make the air taste rotten. “I didn’t ask what you’re interested in,” he murmured. “I asked if you’d survive.” Then he straightened, smoothed his immaculate lapel, and rushed toward the door like he was late for something.

At the door, he paused, one hand resting lightly against the glass as if savoring the moment. He looked back over his shoulder, eyes gleaming. “Oh, and Remi?”

My name sounded poisoned in his mouth.

“Try not to die before Tuesday,” the Night Manager said, smooth as ice. “I’d hate to lose someone… promising.”

He winked, then slipped out. The doors hissed closed behind him. The air didn’t relax—it thickened, heavy as a held breath, and for a long moment it felt like even the walls were listening.

I collapsed to my knees, legs drained of strength. My heart was pounding, but everything else inside me felt frozen. Somewhere between panic and paralysis. The old man had vanished too. No footsteps. No goodbye. One second he was there, the next… gone. Like there was a trapdoor in the floor only he knew about.

The store stayed quiet as if none of this had happened. I waited. One minute. Then two. Still nothing. Only then did I remember how to breathe. The Night Manager’s card still sat on the shelf. Heavy. Like it was waiting to be acknowledged.

I didn’t touch it.

Not out of caution, but because I didn’t trust it not to touch me back. I used a toothbrush and shoved it behind a row of cereal boxes, like it was a live roach, and headed toward the breakroom. I needed caffeine. 

In the breakroom, I poured the last inch of lukewarm coffee into a cracked mug and sat down just long enough to read the rules again. Memorize them. It was the only thing that made me feel remotely prepared. Eventually, I got up and forced myself to keep working. Restocking shelves felt normal. Familiar. Safe.

Until it wasn’t.

It was 4:13 a.m. I remember that because I had just finished putting away the last can of beans when I heard it. Tap. Tap. Tap.

On the cooler door behind me.

I turned automatically.

And froze.

My reflection was standing there. It was me—but not me. Something was off. Too still. Too sharp. Then it tilted its head. I mirrored the movement, instinctively. It smiled. And that’s when my stomach dropped. The first rule slammed into my mind like a trap snapping shut:

“**The reflections in the cooler doors are no longer yours after 2:17 a.m. Do not look at them. If you accidentally do, keep eye contact. It gets worse if you look away first.**”

So I didn’t look away.

I locked eyes with the thing wearing my face. It tilted its head again. Wider smile. Too wide. My skin crawled. My breath caught. I was stuck—and the rule didn’t say how to get out of this. I had one idea. Use the rules against each other.

I slipped my phone out, eyes locked on its gaze, and in a voice barely more than a whisper, I said: “Hey Siri, play baby crying sounds.”

Shrill wails filled the aisle. Instant. Echoing.

And I saw it—the reflection flinched.

Then I heard footsteps from Aisle 3.

Heavy ones.

I had used the second rule: “**If you hear a baby crying in Aisle 3, proceed to the loading dock and lock yourself inside. Stay there for exactly 11 minutes. No more. No less.**”

The reflection’s grin cracked, its jaw spasming like it was holding back a scream. Then it snapped, bolting sideways—jagged, frantic—and melted into the next freezer door like smoke sucked into a vent.

I didn’t wait to see what came next.

I ran. Sprinting for the loading dock, every step a drumbeat in my skull. But before I could slam the door shut, I glanced back.

Ten feet away, barreling straight for me, was a nightmare stitched out of panic and fever: a heaving knot of arms—hundreds of them—clawing at the tiles to drag itself forward. Too many fingers. Hands sprouting from hands, folding over each other like a wave of flesh. Faces pressed and stretched between the limbs like trapped things trying to scream but never getting air. It rolled, slithered and sprinted straight at me, faster than anything that size should move.

I slammed the door, locked it, killed the crying sound, and fumbled for my phone to set the timer. Eleven minutes. Exactly, like the rule said.

I sat on the cold concrete, shaking so hard my teeth hurt, lungs dragging in air that didn’t seem to reach my chest.

Three booming bangs shook the door, wet and heavy, like palms the size of frying pans slapping against metal.

Then—silence.

I stared at the timer. The seconds crawled. When the eleven minutes were up, I opened the door. And the store looked exactly the same. Shelves neat. Lights buzzing. Aisles quiet. Like none of it had ever happened.

But it had.

And I’d figured something out. This place didn’t just follow rules. It played by them. Which meant if I stayed smart—if I stayed sharp—I could play back. And maybe that’s how I’d survive.

The old man came again at 6 a.m. with the same indifference as always, like this wasn’t a nightmarish hellstore and we weren’t all inches from being ripped inside-out by the rules.

He carried a battered clipboard, sipped burnt coffee like it still tasted like something, and gave me a once-over that landed somewhere between clinical and pitying.

“You’re still here,” he said, like that was surprising.

I didn’t have the energy to be sarcastic. “Unfortunately.”

He nodded like I’d just reported the weather. “Did you take the card?” he asked.

I shook my head. “It didn't seem like a normal card”

The old man didn’t nod. He didn’t do much of anything, really—just stood there, looking at me the way someone looks at a cracked teacup. Not ruined. Not useful. Just existing without reason.

“You made it through the reflection,” he said finally. “That’s something.”

I leaned against the breakroom doorframe, hands still trembling, trying to pretend they weren’t. “Barely. Had to bait one rule with another. It felt like solving a haunted crossword puzzle with my life on the line.”

That, finally, earned the faintest twitch of a grin.

“Smart,” he said. “Risky. But smart.”

I waited. When he didn’t say anything else, I asked, “Why did he show up?” 

“He showed up because you’re still standing.” the old man said, his voice going flat.

I didn’t respond right away. That thought—that just surviving was enough to get his attention—made something cold slither under my skin. The Night Manager didn’t seem like the kind of guy who handed out gold stars. No. He tracked potential. Watched like a spider deciding which fly was smart enough to be worth webbing up slowly.

“Why me?” I finally asked.

The old man was already walking away, clipboard tucked under one arm. “You should ask yourself something better,” he said. “Why now?”

I followed him.

Down past the cereal aisle, past the cooler doors (which I now avoided like they were leaking poison), past the place where the mangled mess of hands chased me. That question stuck with me. Why now?

“Did you ever take the card?” I asked suddenly. “Did he ever offer it to you?”

The old man’s footsteps slowed. Just slightly. Barely enough to notice. But I did.

He didn’t turn.

“I said no,” he replied after a beat.

“And?”

“I’m still here, aren’t I?”

Not exactly comforting.

We walked in silence for a while, the hum of the fluorescents buzzing overhead like mosquitoes in a motel room. The store didn’t feel real anymore. It hadn’t for a while. It felt like a set, a stage. Like we were performing normalcy just well enough to keep something worse from stepping onstage.

“He said Phase Two was a clarification of expectations,” I said. “What does that actually mean?”

He gave me a look I didn’t like. Like he wasn’t sure if I was ready for the answer—or if saying it aloud would invite something to come confirm it.

Then he said, “It means you’re on your own now.”

I stopped walking.

“What?”

He turned to face me fully for the first time since we started this walk. “Up until now, the rules were enough. You followed them, or you didn’t. Cause, effect. But Phase Two means you’ve graduated from ‘basic survival’ to something else. Now things notice you.”

A beat. “And the rules?”

“They still matter,” he said. “But now they twist. Shift. Sometimes they bait you.”

I stared at him. “They bait you?”

He nodded. “And sometimes the only way out is by using one against another.”

I exhaled slowly. “So there’s no safety net.”

“No,” he said, almost gently. “But if it makes you feel better… there never was.”

I felt the walls press in again.

This wasn’t a job anymore. It never had been.

It was a trial. An experiment. A maze, maybe. With rules that sometimes saved you, and sometimes led you straight into the Minotaur’s mouth. And the Night Manager?

He was just the one watching which rats figured out the shortcuts—and which ones continued to stay in the maze.

That night, I slept like a log.

Not because I was calm—hell no. It was more like my brain knew I wouldn’t survive if I showed up to work even half-asleep. Like some primal part of me finally understood the stakes.

When I dragged myself in for the next shift, the old man was already there—just like always. Same bitter coffee, same battered clipboard. But this time, something about him was different. Not tired. Not grim.

Determined.

“It’s three more nights until your evaluation,” he said, like it mattered to both of us. I nodded slowly. “Should I be dreading the three nights… or the evaluation itself?” He didn’t answer right away.

Instead, I asked, “What happens after Phase Two?”

He froze. Just for a second. But enough.

Then he said it—quietly, like it was a confession, not a fact. “Oh. I never made it past Phase Two.” I blinked. “Wait… but you’re still here.”

He smiled. Not warmly. Not bitterly. Just… thin. Mechanical.

“Yes,” he said. “I am.”

Something in my gut twisted.

Because I know what happened to people who broke the rules. Who failed. They were erased. Gone like they’d never been here at all.

But him? He stayed. And that’s when I realized all the little things I’d been filing under “weird but whatever.”

The way the lines in his face deepened every day, like time was carving at him but never finishing the job. How he only ever sipped at that lukewarm sludge he called coffee, never swallowing enough to matter. How his footsteps made no sound. How the motion sensors never blinked when he walked by. How the store itself acted like he wasn’t even there.

“How long have you been here?” I asked, quieter than I meant to.

His eyes didn’t quite meet mine. “Long enough.”

The silence stretched.

“You okay?” I asked.

“I’m always okay,” he replied instantly.

Too instantly.

That was when I knew.

He looked like a man. Talked like one.

But whatever he was now…

Whatever Phase Two had done to him…

He wasn’t exactly human anymore.",1,1753534313.0,TeenHorrorWriters,0,1.0,False

1m9sjil,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m9sjil,Is this genuine? 1911 Cunard Line menu,"I was recently given a box of titanic reproduction items my dad found at an op shop; boarding passes, post cards, etc, and slipped into the box was this; what appears to be a genuine menu from the Lusitania from 1911. The card feels very old and everything about it looks legit; it was just hidden with titanic memorabilia, presumably once as a part of a personal collection.

I don’t really want to sell it, as I’m attached to the history and the Cunard lines connections to Titanic, but I am curious if anyone knows how much it might be worth.

I’d also love to know any advice you might have on how to tell if this is the real thing.

The whole thing feels reliable and uncomplicated. He seems like a good guy. 

But he doesn’t open up. We’ve had a netflix&chill and also a coffee date where conversation was in focus; but he doesn’t open up. Barely answers my questions. Barely asks me questions. It seems to me we know nothing about each other. 

Sometimes it seems he’s very anxious, almost in a rush. When it’s just the two of us he can relax and is physically affectionate. 

I know that for some people it’s not easy to have a conversation or to open up. But it seems so weird to me that conversation is not flowing between us. In the initial stages, shouldn’t both parties be very interested in each other?

Can this be a character trait? Is he just slow to trust someone new? Or this is fundamental incompatibility?

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t.

Every muscle screamed—RUN—but I just stood there, frozen. Like an idiot wax figure in a haunted diorama.

Because he was here.

The Night Manager.

He didn’t just look at me. He peeled me apart with his eyes—slow, meticulous, clinical. Like a frog in a high school lab he couldn’t wait to slice open. I didn’t move. Not out of courage. Just the kind of primal instinct that tells you not to twitch while something ancient and awful decides if you’re prey or plaything.

He tilted his head—not like a person, but like a crow picking over roadkill.

“Phase Two,” he said, “is not a punishment.” Great.

“Though if you prefer punishment,” he added, “that can be arranged.”

His voice was polished, sure—but empty. Like someone programmed a seduction algorithm and forgot to add a soul. “It’s an adjustment,” he continued. “A clarification of expectations. An opportunity.”

That last word made the old man flinch. And honestly? Good. Nice to know I wasn’t the only one whose stomach turned at the sound of him talking like a recruiter for a cult.

The Night Manager turned toward him, slow, and smiled wider.

“You remain curious.” He said it like it was a defect that needed fixing. The old man stayed silent. Maybe he wasn’t even supposed to be here—but right now, I was glad he was. Anything was better than being left alone with this thing.

Then those unnatural eyes locked on me. His grin aimed for human and missed by miles. “You’re adapting. Not thriving, of course—but surviving.”

Well, thank you for noticing, eldritch boss man. I do try.

Then—he moved. Or didn’t. I don’t know. There was just less space. “I evaluate personnel personally when they make it this far,” he said. “Five more nights, and then we begin your final review.” A performance review. Wonderful.

His grin stretched just a bit too far. Perfect teeth. The kind of smile you'd see in an ad for dental work… or on a predator pretending to be human.

“Most don’t make it this far,” he said, voice light now, like this was some casual lunch meeting. “Still, you’re not quite what I expected. But then again, you’re human—blinking, sleeping, feeling. Inefficient. But adorable.”

I spoke before I could stop myself. “You call us inefficient, but you spend a lot of time pretending to be one of us. For someone above it all, you seem… invested.”

Something flickered behind his eyes—not anger. Amusement. “Oh,” he purred. “A sense of humor. Careful. That tends to draw attention.”

He smiled again.

“Especially mine.”

Ew.

He stepped closer. “If you’re very good, and very quiet, and just a little clever…” His voice dripped syrup. “You might earn something special.” His grin stretched wider, skin bending wrong. “Something permanent.” From his jacket, he placed a black card on the shelf as if it might bite.

**Night Supervisor Candidate – Pending Review**

My heart stuttered.

“I’m not interested,” I said. My voice shook, pathetic but honest.

He leaned close enough to make the air taste rotten. “I didn’t ask what you’re interested in,” he murmured. “I asked if you’d survive.” Then he straightened, smoothed his immaculate lapel, and rushed toward the door like he was late for something.

At the door, he paused, one hand resting lightly against the glass as if savoring the moment. He looked back over his shoulder, eyes gleaming. “Oh, and Remi?”

My name sounded poisoned in his mouth.

“Try not to die before Tuesday,” the Night Manager said, smooth as ice. “I’d hate to lose someone… promising.”

He winked, then slipped out. The doors hissed closed behind him. The air didn’t relax—it thickened, heavy as a held breath, and for a long moment it felt like even the walls were listening.

I collapsed to my knees, legs drained of strength. My heart was pounding, but everything else inside me felt frozen. Somewhere between panic and paralysis. The old man had vanished too. No footsteps. No goodbye. One second he was there, the next… gone. Like there was a trapdoor in the floor only he knew about.

The store stayed quiet as if none of this had happened. I waited. One minute. Then two. Still nothing. Only then did I remember how to breathe. The Night Manager’s card still sat on the shelf. Heavy. Like it was waiting to be acknowledged.

I didn’t touch it.

Not out of caution, but because I didn’t trust it not to touch me back. I used a toothbrush and shoved it behind a row of cereal boxes, like it was a live roach, and headed toward the breakroom. I needed caffeine. 

In the breakroom, I poured the last inch of lukewarm coffee into a cracked mug and sat down just long enough to read the rules again. Memorize them. It was the only thing that made me feel remotely prepared. Eventually, I got up and forced myself to keep working. Restocking shelves felt normal. Familiar. Safe.

Until it wasn’t.

It was 4:13 a.m. I remember that because I had just finished putting away the last can of beans when I heard it. Tap. Tap. Tap.

On the cooler door behind me.

I turned automatically.

And froze.

My reflection was standing there. It was me—but not me. Something was off. Too still. Too sharp. Then it tilted its head. I mirrored the movement, instinctively. It smiled. And that’s when my stomach dropped. The first rule slammed into my mind like a trap snapping shut:

“**The reflections in the cooler doors are no longer yours after 2:17 a.m. Do not look at them. If you accidentally do, keep eye contact. It gets worse if you look away first.**”

So I didn’t look away.

I locked eyes with the thing wearing my face. It tilted its head again. Wider smile. Too wide. My skin crawled. My breath caught. I was stuck—and the rule didn’t say how to get out of this. I had one idea. Use the rules against each other.

I slipped my phone out, eyes locked on its gaze, and in a voice barely more than a whisper, I said: “Hey Siri, play baby crying sounds.”

Shrill wails filled the aisle. Instant. Echoing.

And I saw it—the reflection flinched.

Then I heard footsteps from Aisle 3.

Heavy ones.

I had used the second rule: “**If you hear a baby crying in Aisle 3, proceed to the loading dock and lock yourself inside. Stay there for exactly 11 minutes. No more. No less.**”

The reflection’s grin cracked, its jaw spasming like it was holding back a scream. Then it snapped, bolting sideways—jagged, frantic—and melted into the next freezer door like smoke sucked into a vent.

I didn’t wait to see what came next.

I ran. Sprinting for the loading dock, every step a drumbeat in my skull. But before I could slam the door shut, I glanced back.

Ten feet away, barreling straight for me, was a nightmare stitched out of panic and fever: a heaving knot of arms—hundreds of them—clawing at the tiles to drag itself forward. Too many fingers. Hands sprouting from hands, folding over each other like a wave of flesh. Faces pressed and stretched between the limbs like trapped things trying to scream but never getting air. It rolled, slithered and sprinted straight at me, faster than anything that size should move.

I slammed the door, locked it, killed the crying sound, and fumbled for my phone to set the timer. Eleven minutes. Exactly, like the rule said.

I sat on the cold concrete, shaking so hard my teeth hurt, lungs dragging in air that didn’t seem to reach my chest.

Three booming bangs shook the door, wet and heavy, like palms the size of frying pans slapping against metal.

Then—silence.

I stared at the timer. The seconds crawled. When the eleven minutes were up, I opened the door. And the store looked exactly the same. Shelves neat. Lights buzzing. Aisles quiet. Like none of it had ever happened.

But it had.

And I’d figured something out. This place didn’t just follow rules. It played by them. Which meant if I stayed smart—if I stayed sharp—I could play back. And maybe that’s how I’d survive.

The old man came again at 6 a.m. with the same indifference as always, like this wasn’t a nightmarish hellstore and we weren’t all inches from being ripped inside-out by the rules.

He carried a battered clipboard, sipped burnt coffee like it still tasted like something, and gave me a once-over that landed somewhere between clinical and pitying.

“You’re still here,” he said, like that was surprising.

I didn’t have the energy to be sarcastic. “Unfortunately.”

He nodded like I’d just reported the weather. “Did you take the card?” he asked.

I shook my head. “It didn't seem like a normal card”

The old man didn’t nod. He didn’t do much of anything, really—just stood there, looking at me the way someone looks at a cracked teacup. Not ruined. Not useful. Just existing without reason.

“You made it through the reflection,” he said finally. “That’s something.”

I leaned against the breakroom doorframe, hands still trembling, trying to pretend they weren’t. “Barely. Had to bait one rule with another. It felt like solving a haunted crossword puzzle with my life on the line.”

That, finally, earned the faintest twitch of a grin.

“Smart,” he said. “Risky. But smart.”

I waited. When he didn’t say anything else, I asked, “Why did he show up?” 

“He showed up because you’re still standing.” the old man said, his voice going flat.

I didn’t respond right away. That thought—that just surviving was enough to get his attention—made something cold slither under my skin. The Night Manager didn’t seem like the kind of guy who handed out gold stars. No. He tracked potential. Watched like a spider deciding which fly was smart enough to be worth webbing up slowly.

“Why me?” I finally asked.

The old man was already walking away, clipboard tucked under one arm. “You should ask yourself something better,” he said. “Why now?”

I followed him.

Down past the cereal aisle, past the cooler doors (which I now avoided like they were leaking poison), past the place where the mangled mess of hands chased me. That question stuck with me. Why now?

“Did you ever take the card?” I asked suddenly. “Did he ever offer it to you?”

The old man’s footsteps slowed. Just slightly. Barely enough to notice. But I did.

He didn’t turn.

“I said no,” he replied after a beat.

“And?”

“I’m still here, aren’t I?”

Not exactly comforting.

We walked in silence for a while, the hum of the fluorescents buzzing overhead like mosquitoes in a motel room. The store didn’t feel real anymore. It hadn’t for a while. It felt like a set, a stage. Like we were performing normalcy just well enough to keep something worse from stepping onstage.

“He said Phase Two was a clarification of expectations,” I said. “What does that actually mean?”

He gave me a look I didn’t like. Like he wasn’t sure if I was ready for the answer—or if saying it aloud would invite something to come confirm it.

Then he said, “It means you’re on your own now.”

I stopped walking.

“What?”

He turned to face me fully for the first time since we started this walk. “Up until now, the rules were enough. You followed them, or you didn’t. Cause, effect. But Phase Two means you’ve graduated from ‘basic survival’ to something else. Now things notice you.”

A beat. “And the rules?”

“They still matter,” he said. “But now they twist. Shift. Sometimes they bait you.”

I stared at him. “They bait you?”

He nodded. “And sometimes the only way out is by using one against another.”

I exhaled slowly. “So there’s no safety net.”

“No,” he said, almost gently. “But if it makes you feel better… there never was.”

I felt the walls press in again.

This wasn’t a job anymore. It never had been.

It was a trial. An experiment. A maze, maybe. With rules that sometimes saved you, and sometimes led you straight into the Minotaur’s mouth. And the Night Manager?

He was just the one watching which rats figured out the shortcuts—and which ones continued to stay in the maze.

That night, I slept like a log.

Not because I was calm—hell no. It was more like my brain knew I wouldn’t survive if I showed up to work even half-asleep. Like some primal part of me finally understood the stakes.

When I dragged myself in for the next shift, the old man was already there—just like always. Same bitter coffee, same battered clipboard. But this time, something about him was different. Not tired. Not grim.

Determined.

“It’s three more nights until your evaluation,” he said, like it mattered to both of us. I nodded slowly. “Should I be dreading the three nights… or the evaluation itself?” He didn’t answer right away.

Instead, I asked, “What happens after Phase Two?”

He froze. Just for a second. But enough.

Then he said it—quietly, like it was a confession, not a fact. “Oh. I never made it past Phase Two.” I blinked. “Wait… but you’re still here.”

He smiled. Not warmly. Not bitterly. Just… thin. Mechanical.

“Yes,” he said. “I am.”

Something in my gut twisted.

Because I know what happened to people who broke the rules. Who failed. They were erased. Gone like they’d never been here at all.

But him? He stayed. And that’s when I realized all the little things I’d been filing under “weird but whatever.”

The way the lines in his face deepened every day, like time was carving at him but never finishing the job. How he only ever sipped at that lukewarm sludge he called coffee, never swallowing enough to matter. How his footsteps made no sound. How the motion sensors never blinked when he walked by. How the store itself acted like he wasn’t even there.

“How long have you been here?” I asked, quieter than I meant to.

His eyes didn’t quite meet mine. “Long enough.”

The silence stretched.

“You okay?” I asked.

“I’m always okay,” he replied instantly.

Too instantly.

That was when I knew.

He looked like a man. Talked like one.

But whatever he was now…

Whatever Phase Two had done to him…

Breakfast ke liye main dining area mein gayi, toh dekha woh European group pehle se hi wahan tha. Sab ek dusre se baat kar rahe the, aur unki hansi se pura area goonj raha tha. 🥳 Jaise hi unhone mujhe dekha, sabne smile kiya aur unmein se ek ladka, jo kal raat bohot friendly tha, usne bulaya, ""Hey Sheetal, come join us! We saved a spot for you!"" 🥐☕️

Main unke paas jaakar baith gayi, aur sabse ""Good Morning"" wish kiya. Unhone mujhe invite kiya, ""Hamare sath hi chalo, kahan jaogi akeli? Bali explore karne mein aur maza aayega jab itne saare log honge!"" 👯‍♀️ Unki baatein sunkar mere chehre par ek pyari si smile aa gayi. Sach kahun toh, mujhe bhi unke saath rehna accha lag raha tha. Akeli travel karna ek baat hai, but jab aise friendly log mil jaate hain, toh trip ka charm aur badh jaata hai, hai na? 😉 Maine bhi haan kar di, ""Haan, theek hai, aapke saath hi chalungi. It would be fun!"" 😊

Dusre din ham log kafi sab ghume. Pehle hum Tirta Empul Temple gaye. 🏛️ Wahan ki vibes itni spiritual aur shaant thi! Log holy spring water mein bath le rahe the, aur har taraf ek divine energy thi. Maine bhi wahan ke rituals dekhe aur unki culture ko aur kareeb se samjha. Phir hum Goa Gajah (Elephant Cave) gaye, jahan ancient carvings aur ek mysterious cave thi. Har jagah ek kahani thi, ek history thi. 📜 Most of them spoke English, but few did not, but utna challenge nahi hua. Kuch log gestures se baat karte the, aur kuch Google Translate use karte the! 🤣 Lekin sab itne friendly the ki language barrier feel hi nahi hua. Sab ek dusre ki help kar rahe the, aur har koi ek dusre ko comfortable feel kara raha tha.

Aise hi 1-2 din guzar gaye. Har din naya adventure, naye experiences, aur naye logon ke saath hasi-mazaak. 💖 Unmein se Martin, jo Norway se tha, woh bhi akela tha. Dheere dheere, meri closeness thodi usse badhne lagi thi. 🤫 Woh bohot tall aur handsome tha, uski blue eyes aur curly blonde hair...uff! 🤤 Jab ham ghumte the, zyadatar main aur Martin sath rehte the. Kabhi hum group se thoda alag ho jaate, aur apni baaton mein kho jaate. Mujhe bhi uske sath accha lagta tha, ek ajeeb sa comfort feel hota tha. Martin spoke only English, aur ham log sirf English mein hi baat kar pate the. Lekin hamari conversations bohot deep hoti thi. Hum life, dreams, travel experiences, sab kuch share karte the. 🗣️

Ek din hum ek chote se cafe mein coffee pee rahe the. ☕️ Group ke baaki log aage nikal gaye the. Martin ne meri aankhon mein dekha aur bola, ""You know, Sheetal, there's something about you... you have a really beautiful soul."" ❤️ Uske words sunkar mera dil ek pal ke liye ruk sa gaya. Main bas smile kar di, aur meri nazrein uski aankhon mein kho gayi. 👀 Uske haath ne accidentally mere haath ko touch kiya, aur ek halki si current mere poore body mein daud gayi. 🔥 Woh pal itna pure aur sensual tha, jaise hum dono ek dusre ko bohot saalon se jaante hon. Uske saath har pal special lagne laga tha. Pata nahi tha yeh closeness kahan le jaane wali hai, but I was enjoying every bit of it. 🤫",1,1753533690.0,SheetalDiaries,2,1.0,False

And I think the younger male had some fascination wearing women’s clothes and makeup. I remember a scene towards the end where he had somebody help him do his make up and clothes, but when he sees himself in the mirror, he is not happy.

1m9s9q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m9s9q4/green_sky/,Green sky,"One day, I woke up in my lake house near the small city of Karpenisi, located in northern Greece. It used to be my quiet place back then, before the incident.

It was a typical, calm morning — except for one tiny, yet at the same time massive, detail. Every living creature in the village was acting strangely.

My dog Bruce wasn’t an exception; I watched him pacing back and forth in the backyard, like he was trying to avoid something.

Suddenly, as I was having my morning coffee in the kitchen, I looked out the window — and the sky had turned green.

I had never seen a sky like that before. It was like someone had done a bad Photoshop paint job across the clouds.

The first thing that came to mind was that it was probably an unusual weather phenomenon specific to this area — maybe a reflection from the lake, I thought.

Nothing to worry about, so I grabbed my phone and started Googling “unusual green sky phenomenon.”

Nothing came up except a few fake-news blogs like [*whattheyhidingofus.info*](http://whattheyhidingofus.info), written by conspiracy nerds.

I finished my cup of coffee and decided to go for a walk in the village.

As I was walking on the main road near the lake, I heard Mary’s voice yelling at me. I still remember her exact words, even years later.

“It’s Judgment Day,” she said. “Jesus is here to save us from the evil. You don’t have to worry — everything will be alright.”

I looked at her and smiled. “I’m not worried, Mary,” I replied, trying to avoid her and her religious sermons.

After my little walk by the lake, I returned to my house and turned on the TV to relax in the living room.

When I saw the screen, my blood turned to ice. I grabbed the remote and switched channels, but every channel showed the same thing:

The green sky — and a gigantic alien spaceship, so enormous that no camera lens could fully capture it.

I was terrified. What was going to happen to us?

My heart was pounding, and suddenly I felt something wet on my face. Something didn’t feel right. Something was off.

Before I realized it, I was inside the spaceship. Two tall creatures were staring at me like I was the strange one.

I can’t describe it better — but the way one of them looked at me gave me chills. It didn’t feel like danger.

He approached me with something like an injection device in his hand. He gently held my arm and injected whatever substance was inside.

I didn’t feel any pain, but I fell asleep immediately.

I remember walking through a long, dark, and wet tunnel. I couldn’t see anything, but somehow I kept moving.

I felt something wet on my face again. Suddenly, I opened my eyes.

I was in my bed, and my dog Bruce was on top of me, licking my cheeks with his large tongue.

I jumped out of bed and ran to the window. I looked at the sky.

It was blue again.

It was just a bad dream…

Basically, looking back at my 4 years in secondary school, I realised I am not like the others and I lowkey hate it or I don't even know at this point.

It makes it worse that I am in an UG CCA and throughout my 4 years there, my name was used as an executioner. Like, I had to do all the sai kang work, scolding juniors, and teaching things like CASEVAC and footdrills and like it defo makes things worse because who even likes learning CASEVAC and footdrills. I mean I had a choice to reject but my batch had a number of people who skip CCA and useless ah people so we were very short-staffed and some of my batchmates were quiet and timid so I really had no choice but to do it or else cher will scold and kpkb. And I am quite obedient, basically I am a nerd who sticks to morals and beliefs. Moreover, I am very drawn to the military, like I play MILSIM (if yk what that is) and I actually made it big and I'm kind of like an online moderator for them so a number of my free time is spent on that, so I learnt alot of military lingo and language so it really makes it worse. Like, I went to OBS and my instructor was an ex-encik and I wore Army Tshirts throughout OBS and how do I put this, I have a knee injury I never fully recovered from so I have a tough walking stance. And yeah Mr Encik was very shocked at my Army Contextual knowledge and said I should just go sign on after OBS. Also, in my 4 years in CCA, like I was in debate in primary school so I can project my voice very very loudly - so I was also made to do all the shouting.

This has resulted in when I went to upper sec - unfortunately my class has an odd number of people and because of my name I am dead last. So when we have to pair up, I am like the left out one which is dammm sad. Honestly my class is not even a good class in the first place, we form cliques and start rivalry among once another. Lowkey, because of my UG BG, masculine voice and demeanour - my classmates are ""scared of me"" . Like, Idk what to do ah this is who I am.

In my 4 years here, I was thinking Izit kind of sad I never participated in the crushes and eye candies normalisation. I mean the answer is defo yes because at least I never had my heart broken. Like I legit damm nerd and my gang is legit the kena marginalized of the class. Like, I am legit those church on sunday kids and I read my bible - like my classmates even see me reading bible app in class. In my 4 years here, I never ever liked anyone, had crushes, or eye candies. I go to a notorious school which always appears on singapura viral, a school of vaping crisis, bulying, cyberbulling. Like I remember last year, a girl filmed a sex tape with her boyfriend and it got leaked. You are either a popular kid or marginalised, and I am the marginalised.

Looking through social media, I see my classmates and cohort mates going out with their friends and significant others. Meanwhile, I am the oldest sibling and it makes it worse. My parents are immigrants so alot of responsibility I have to bear. I can't go out during the hols bcos I have to take care of my sibling and the house. Sometimes, I don't know why but I just feel so single. Like I made a playlist called ""I feel so single"" with songs like no surprise by Daughtry. I mean I never thought about love or getting married, stuff like that because I am just not interested so I don't know why I feel this way. Also, my parents are very conservative. Like, I see my classmates dress up and lowkey it looks good. Meanwhile, I hate shopping because I think it is a waste of time and because I have no money because my family is on the low ses side with alot of financial burdens. If I have to go a formal event - I just wear the same pair of jeans and a collared checkered shirt.

Church wise, I stopped attending physically for awhile. I just watch the online sermon and do my own devotions. Context: I found God at my lowest last year and it has changed my life for the better. But, I just feel like I don't fit in with the church community and my CG. It is a family church so I do not blame them and it is my own fault that I don't fit in too or make an enough effort. I am quite introverted too and I would die if I have to talk to people all the time. Meanwhile, trying to look for a church which is more focused on scripture and faith and not so much about community.

I am really such a nerd all I ever talk about is school, CCA, and military stuff. And I show my friends my funny convos from my discord online comm stuff. My hobbies are legit reading the news and writing. Like, I have my own blog that I write on. Like pls, who even uses bloggers nowadays. But, I still use it bcos I genuinely like reading peoples blogs and stories. I believe words and stories are catalysts of human emotions. My Ig is dead like I do not post at all, sometimes I post stories but that's about it. My school teachers are also shocked by my mental age and maturity. Like, I went to chit chat with my teacher about becoming a teacher, salary, and what she does as a Subject Head and teaching routes in MOE. I got a teacher who rides moto, my father also used to ride moto so we talk about funny stories and things like how he used to ride at 195-210 km/h on his moto to go Malaysia. So, when I saw my chers moto I said ""cher how many cc ah"" and he was damm shocked by my contextual knowledge. And Like my hang outs with friends are like ""Eh yw catch up, yw go drink coffee"" and Jn I asked my gang if we wanna go hiking tmr evening and watch sunset. - SOS lah I am such a nerd. In my entire secondary school life, I think I only have 5 life long friends and a bunch of teachers who I chit chat with and I realised I talk to and interact with older people better. Music wife, I listen to westlife, MCR, Bon Jovi, Micheal Jackson, brookside. I don't listen to kpop or watch anime, so I am also such a nerd. I don't react well to funny stuff too. Like, this girl whispered into my ear ""I missed you"" and I definitely was suppose to say something funny or teaseful back but I just stood there like a stone.

To end off, I know comparison is the thief of joy but I don't know Why I still feel this way. I know if I force myself to be like the others I will hate it too, because it is just not me.",7,1753533227.0,SGExams,2,1.0,False

1m9s5b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuntaCana/comments/1m9s5b6/punta_cana_airbnb_review_experience/,Punta Cana Airbnb Review Experience,"
Always like to read experiences on Reddit so thought I would write one up on my recent experience in PC. 

TL;DR: Stayed in an Airbnb at Playa Turquesa in Punta Cana for 5 nights in May for $600 total and found it a great value; secure, quiet, and steps from the beach. Food and drinks at local beach clubs and restaurants were surprisingly good, but the pervasive sulfur smell, sargassum, and aggressive vendors were a big downside. Excursions were just okay, with not much to do beyond extremely touristy activities. Wouldn't return to PC, but for a cheap, lazy beach trip with decent eats it’s not the worst idea in the world.

Sorry this is long, just my random thoughts since I saw when doing some research on where to stay in PC that a lot of people recommend against Airbnb and try to steer you to resorts/hotels. So I thought a write up of my experience may be of use to others who do their travel research on Reddit.

Background:
My goal for this vacation was to have a lazy beach vacation for cheap-ish + eat some decent food and drink (and avoid bad ones).

Rental: 
Ended up booking a rental on Airbnb on the Playa Turquesa property. Was a measly $600 for 5 night stay for two people in a 1 bedroom/2 bath condo with a patio with a grill and right next to pool. There was several listings at this property when I booked a month out. Gorgeous property. They have private beach access and a two pools. Less than 3 minute walk directly on the beach. highly recommend finding a place with private beach access because otherwise you’ll be stuck trying to find where to plant yourself everyday. Nice to have a home base with option to explore other options. Felt extremely secure as they had security roaming around and everything is gated. Plenty of free chairs, tables, loungers etc to go around both on beach and pool side. It was never crowded. The beach had a lot of sargassum in the morning but they were actively trying to remove a bunch. I see photos of this part of the beach at other parts of the year and it looks pretty clear, hopefully that will be the case for you. 

This is not be a negative for this property specifically because the issue was pervasive but a lot of PC smells like sewage and rotting seaweed. We did several excursions so we ended up on several popular resort properties picking people up and the horrible smell was everywhere even at the 5 star resorts. I am really shocked people tolerate this or perhaps we simply went at a bad time (sargassum season).

Food: 
Eating wise, we ate out for all our meals. There is a beachfront restaurant called Restaurant Probar Turquesa on the property and food and cocktails were excellent. Service was great and plenty of seating. Would highly recommend to check it out even if you’re not staying here. Also had a decent breakfast at a restaurant called Castaways. 


We often camped out at beach clubs for lunch when not on an excursion to see other parts of the beach and of course to get some exercise in walking on the sand for extended periods of time. There was one called 365 Beach Club on google but apparently it’s actually called Lima Beach Club when we get there as the business changed hands it seems. We camped out on a comfortable sunbed for several hours drinking and eating, again food was tasty/flavorful (a common theme at PC restaurants, I’ll give them that). The first time we visited were told minimum spend was $35pp and next day it was only $20pp lol. Regardless it was extremely good value. For some reason this part of the beach had way less sargassum and didn’t smell as bad as other parts of the beach, so was a more pleasant swim here. We had several cocktails and plenty of leftover food. 


The other beach club we walked to was Soles Beach Club. More great drinks and food and lazed out on their loungers for several hours while swimming, napping and knocking back delicious margaritas all for excellent price in my opinion. 


For dinner highlights included La Bruja Chupadora, which had an excellent selection of delicious grilled and/or braised meats. Trebole restaurant for a more fine dining experiences in a very gorgeous space. And finally Jellyfish Restaurant for dinner on the beach with live music and delicious seafood. Overall good food and drink was the priority and thankfully accomplished this. Definitely a little more expensive than I would hope and I say this comparing it to one of the most expensive cities in the world.

Excursions:
There is not a whole lot to do outside of your resort and I see why it’s recommended not to go out and explore. A million ATV tours and party cruises but not a lot else. I went to Taino lab for rum tasting and that was a fun experience learning more about rum and also got to try some chocolate and coffee. Did an ATV tour that also involved a stop for 40 minutes at Macao beach, which was gorgeous and lacked sargassum issue. Briefly did encounter the sewer smell on my way out. The vendors on these tours are extremely aggressive, it really sours the whole thing. But tbh the vendors are aggressive everywhere. One of the major reasons why I will likely not be back to PC is because every step of the way people are trying to extract money from you. I hear this is also the case on resorts as well when you’re on the beach which is a shame. But these people have to eat, can’t be too upset. 

Transport: Used DAT for airport transfer from PUJ to Play Turquesa. Was seamless and cost us $75 round trip. We used Uber a few times within Punta Cana. It was very cheap and I felt safe. They will not take you beyond Punta Cana it seems. 

I had a decent 5 night vacation but as mentioned probably won’t be back. From the pervasive smell issue, sargassum issue, lack of drinkable faucet water, aggressive vendors who constantly harass you for a sale no matter where you are, the fact that all beaches are public but resorts have a complete monopoly over the space so truly not and how food/drink cost can easily add up if not careful. For overall the little money we spent if we were to have done an AI resort for the same price I feel pretty confident I would have had a worse time given the reviews for a lot of the food and drink at AI, so I feel pretty good about that. But you’re definitely going to be more comfortable on a resort and will likely have a nicer beach. 

I feel there are better places to stay and spend your money but this accomplished what it needed to accomplish which was a relatively inexpensive escape from the city. You’d definitely need to spend more money in other parts of the Carribean for comparable experience.",2,1753533044.0,PuntaCana,0,0.75,False

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t.

Every muscle screamed—RUN—but I just stood there, frozen. Like an idiot wax figure in a haunted diorama.

Because he was here.

The Night Manager.

He didn’t just look at me. He peeled me apart with his eyes—slow, meticulous, clinical. Like a frog in a high school lab he couldn’t wait to slice open. I didn’t move. Not out of courage. Just the kind of primal instinct that tells you not to twitch while something ancient and awful decides if you’re prey or plaything.

He tilted his head—not like a person, but like a crow picking over roadkill.

“Phase Two,” he said, “is not a punishment.” Great.

“Though if you prefer punishment,” he added, “that can be arranged.”

His voice was polished, sure—but empty. Like someone programmed a seduction algorithm and forgot to add a soul. “It’s an adjustment,” he continued. “A clarification of expectations. An opportunity.”

That last word made the old man flinch. And honestly? Good. Nice to know I wasn’t the only one whose stomach turned at the sound of him talking like a recruiter for a cult.

The Night Manager turned toward him, slow, and smiled wider.

“You remain curious.” He said it like it was a defect that needed fixing. The old man stayed silent. Maybe he wasn’t even supposed to be here—but right now, I was glad he was. Anything was better than being left alone with this thing.

Then those unnatural eyes locked on me. His grin aimed for human and missed by miles. “You’re adapting. Not thriving, of course—but surviving.”

Well, thank you for noticing, eldritch boss man. I do try.

Then—he moved. Or didn’t. I don’t know. There was just less space. “I evaluate personnel personally when they make it this far,” he said. “Five more nights, and then we begin your final review.” A performance review. Wonderful.

His grin stretched just a bit too far. Perfect teeth. The kind of smile you'd see in an ad for dental work… or on a predator pretending to be human.

“Most don’t make it this far,” he said, voice light now, like this was some casual lunch meeting. “Still, you’re not quite what I expected. But then again, you’re human—blinking, sleeping, feeling. Inefficient. But adorable.”

I spoke before I could stop myself. “You call us inefficient, but you spend a lot of time pretending to be one of us. For someone above it all, you seem… invested.”

Something flickered behind his eyes—not anger. Amusement. “Oh,” he purred. “A sense of humor. Careful. That tends to draw attention.”

He smiled again.

“Especially mine.”

Ew.

He stepped closer. “If you’re very good, and very quiet, and just a little clever…” His voice dripped syrup. “You might earn something special.” His grin stretched wider, skin bending wrong. “Something permanent.” From his jacket, he placed a black card on the shelf as if it might bite.

**Night Supervisor Candidate – Pending Review**

My heart stuttered.

“I’m not interested,” I said. My voice shook, pathetic but honest.

He leaned close enough to make the air taste rotten. “I didn’t ask what you’re interested in,” he murmured. “I asked if you’d survive.” Then he straightened, smoothed his immaculate lapel, and rushed toward the door like he was late for something.

At the door, he paused, one hand resting lightly against the glass as if savoring the moment. He looked back over his shoulder, eyes gleaming. “Oh, and Remi?”

My name sounded poisoned in his mouth.

“Try not to die before Tuesday,” the Night Manager said, smooth as ice. “I’d hate to lose someone… promising.”

He winked, then slipped out. The doors hissed closed behind him. The air didn’t relax—it thickened, heavy as a held breath, and for a long moment it felt like even the walls were listening.

I collapsed to my knees, legs drained of strength. My heart was pounding, but everything else inside me felt frozen. Somewhere between panic and paralysis. The old man had vanished too. No footsteps. No goodbye. One second he was there, the next… gone. Like there was a trapdoor in the floor only he knew about.

The store stayed quiet as if none of this had happened. I waited. One minute. Then two. Still nothing. Only then did I remember how to breathe. The Night Manager’s card still sat on the shelf. Heavy. Like it was waiting to be acknowledged.

I didn’t touch it.

Not out of caution, but because I didn’t trust it not to touch me back. I used a toothbrush and shoved it behind a row of cereal boxes, like it was a live roach, and headed toward the breakroom. I needed caffeine. 

In the breakroom, I poured the last inch of lukewarm coffee into a cracked mug and sat down just long enough to read the rules again. Memorize them. It was the only thing that made me feel remotely prepared. Eventually, I got up and forced myself to keep working. Restocking shelves felt normal. Familiar. Safe.

Until it wasn’t.

It was 4:13 a.m. I remember that because I had just finished putting away the last can of beans when I heard it. Tap. Tap. Tap.

On the cooler door behind me.

I turned automatically.

And froze.

My reflection was standing there. It was me—but not me. Something was off. Too still. Too sharp. Then it tilted its head. I mirrored the movement, instinctively. It smiled. And that’s when my stomach dropped. The first rule slammed into my mind like a trap snapping shut:

“**The reflections in the cooler doors are no longer yours after 2:17 a.m. Do not look at them. If you accidentally do, keep eye contact. It gets worse if you look away first.**”

So I didn’t look away.

I locked eyes with the thing wearing my face. It tilted its head again. Wider smile. Too wide. My skin crawled. My breath caught. I was stuck—and the rule didn’t say how to get out of this. I had one idea. Use the rules against each other.

I slipped my phone out, eyes locked on its gaze, and in a voice barely more than a whisper, I said: “Hey Siri, play baby crying sounds.”

Shrill wails filled the aisle. Instant. Echoing.

And I saw it—the reflection flinched.

Then I heard footsteps from Aisle 3.

Heavy ones.

I had used the second rule: “**If you hear a baby crying in Aisle 3, proceed to the loading dock and lock yourself inside. Stay there for exactly 11 minutes. No more. No less.**”

The reflection’s grin cracked, its jaw spasming like it was holding back a scream. Then it snapped, bolting sideways—jagged, frantic—and melted into the next freezer door like smoke sucked into a vent.

I didn’t wait to see what came next.

I ran. Sprinting for the loading dock, every step a drumbeat in my skull. But before I could slam the door shut, I glanced back.

Ten feet away, barreling straight for me, was a nightmare stitched out of panic and fever: a heaving knot of arms—hundreds of them—clawing at the tiles to drag itself forward. Too many fingers. Hands sprouting from hands, folding over each other like a wave of flesh. Faces pressed and stretched between the limbs like trapped things trying to scream but never getting air. It rolled, slithered and sprinted straight at me, faster than anything that size should move.

I slammed the door, locked it, killed the crying sound, and fumbled for my phone to set the timer. Eleven minutes. Exactly, like the rule said.

I sat on the cold concrete, shaking so hard my teeth hurt, lungs dragging in air that didn’t seem to reach my chest.

Three booming bangs shook the door, wet and heavy, like palms the size of frying pans slapping against metal.

Then—silence.

I stared at the timer. The seconds crawled. When the eleven minutes were up, I opened the door. And the store looked exactly the same. Shelves neat. Lights buzzing. Aisles quiet. Like none of it had ever happened.

But it had.

And I’d figured something out. This place didn’t just follow rules. It played by them. Which meant if I stayed smart—if I stayed sharp—I could play back. And maybe that’s how I’d survive.

The old man came again at 6 a.m. with the same indifference as always, like this wasn’t a nightmarish hellstore and we weren’t all inches from being ripped inside-out by the rules.

He carried a battered clipboard, sipped burnt coffee like it still tasted like something, and gave me a once-over that landed somewhere between clinical and pitying.

“You’re still here,” he said, like that was surprising.

I didn’t have the energy to be sarcastic. “Unfortunately.”

He nodded like I’d just reported the weather. “Did you take the card?” he asked.

I shook my head. “It didn't seem like a normal card”

The old man didn’t nod. He didn’t do much of anything, really—just stood there, looking at me the way someone looks at a cracked teacup. Not ruined. Not useful. Just existing without reason.

“You made it through the reflection,” he said finally. “That’s something.”

I leaned against the breakroom doorframe, hands still trembling, trying to pretend they weren’t. “Barely. Had to bait one rule with another. It felt like solving a haunted crossword puzzle with my life on the line.”

That, finally, earned the faintest twitch of a grin.

“Smart,” he said. “Risky. But smart.”

I waited. When he didn’t say anything else, I asked, “Why did he show up?” 

“He showed up because you’re still standing.” the old man said, his voice going flat.

I didn’t respond right away. That thought—that just surviving was enough to get his attention—made something cold slither under my skin. The Night Manager didn’t seem like the kind of guy who handed out gold stars. No. He tracked potential. Watched like a spider deciding which fly was smart enough to be worth webbing up slowly.

“Why me?” I finally asked.

The old man was already walking away, clipboard tucked under one arm. “You should ask yourself something better,” he said. “Why now?”

I followed him.

Down past the cereal aisle, past the cooler doors (which I now avoided like they were leaking poison), past the place where the mangled mess of hands chased me. That question stuck with me. Why now?

“Did you ever take the card?” I asked suddenly. “Did he ever offer it to you?”

The old man’s footsteps slowed. Just slightly. Barely enough to notice. But I did.

He didn’t turn.

“I said no,” he replied after a beat.

“And?”

“I’m still here, aren’t I?”

Not exactly comforting.

We walked in silence for a while, the hum of the fluorescents buzzing overhead like mosquitoes in a motel room. The store didn’t feel real anymore. It hadn’t for a while. It felt like a set, a stage. Like we were performing normalcy just well enough to keep something worse from stepping onstage.

“He said Phase Two was a clarification of expectations,” I said. “What does that actually mean?”

He gave me a look I didn’t like. Like he wasn’t sure if I was ready for the answer—or if saying it aloud would invite something to come confirm it.

Then he said, “It means you’re on your own now.”

I stopped walking.

“What?”

He turned to face me fully for the first time since we started this walk. “Up until now, the rules were enough. You followed them, or you didn’t. Cause, effect. But Phase Two means you’ve graduated from ‘basic survival’ to something else. Now things notice you.”

A beat. “And the rules?”

“They still matter,” he said. “But now they twist. Shift. Sometimes they bait you.”

I stared at him. “They bait you?”

He nodded. “And sometimes the only way out is by using one against another.”

I exhaled slowly. “So there’s no safety net.”

“No,” he said, almost gently. “But if it makes you feel better… there never was.”

I felt the walls press in again.

This wasn’t a job anymore. It never had been.

It was a trial. An experiment. A maze, maybe. With rules that sometimes saved you, and sometimes led you straight into the Minotaur’s mouth. And the Night Manager?

He was just the one watching which rats figured out the shortcuts—and which ones continued to stay in the maze.

That night, I slept like a log.

Not because I was calm—hell no. It was more like my brain knew I wouldn’t survive if I showed up to work even half-asleep. Like some primal part of me finally understood the stakes.

When I dragged myself in for the next shift, the old man was already there—just like always. Same bitter coffee, same battered clipboard. But this time, something about him was different. Not tired. Not grim.

Determined.

“It’s three more nights until your evaluation,” he said, like it mattered to both of us. I nodded slowly. “Should I be dreading the three nights… or the evaluation itself?” He didn’t answer right away.

Instead, I asked, “What happens after Phase Two?”

He froze. Just for a second. But enough.

Then he said it—quietly, like it was a confession, not a fact. “Oh. I never made it past Phase Two.” I blinked. “Wait… but you’re still here.”

He smiled. Not warmly. Not bitterly. Just… thin. Mechanical.

“Yes,” he said. “I am.”

Something in my gut twisted.

Because I know what happened to people who broke the rules. Who failed. They were erased. Gone like they’d never been here at all.

But him? He stayed. And that’s when I realized all the little things I’d been filing under “weird but whatever.”

The way the lines in his face deepened every day, like time was carving at him but never finishing the job. How he only ever sipped at that lukewarm sludge he called coffee, never swallowing enough to matter. How his footsteps made no sound. How the motion sensors never blinked when he walked by. How the store itself acted like he wasn’t even there.

“How long have you been here?” I asked, quieter than I meant to.

His eyes didn’t quite meet mine. “Long enough.”

The silence stretched.

“You okay?” I asked.

“I’m always okay,” he replied instantly.

Too instantly.

That was when I knew.

He looked like a man. Talked like one.

But whatever he was now…

Whatever Phase Two had done to him…

On my birthday, I flew across the ocean to surprise them… and found him having dinner with his true love—my stepsister.  
My daughter looked at her and said, “Mommy.”  
That day, I finally woke up.  
I drafted the divorce papers, gave up custody, and walked away from it all, building a billion-dollar empire from scratch.  
But when I returned home one night with a business partner, my ex husband cornered me against the wall.  
“Divorce?” he said, eyes dark. “Not a chance.”  
  
After seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman—even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.  
I scoffed at the years I’d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,  
“Divorce? Not a chance.”  
\*\*\*  
When Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.  
It was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends—but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.  
Celeste's smile faded.  
By the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.  
Hannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. ""Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.""  
""Where are Trevor and Jo?"" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.  
""Mr. Fleming isn’t back yet. Miss Jordyn’s upstairs playing.""  
Celeste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.  
""Jo?"" Celeste called.  
Jordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, ""Mom!""  
But then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.  
Celeste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. ""Mom, I’m busy.""   
It had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.  
She noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. ""Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?""  
""Mm-hm!"" Jordyn perked up visibly. ""Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?""  
Celeste’s throat tightened. Jordyn didn’t look up, only added brightly, ""Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow—""  
Celeste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. ""Jo… Do you remember it's my birthday today?""  
""Huh?"" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, ""Mom, don’t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order—""  
Celeste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.  
Downstairs, Hannah said, ""I called Mr. Fleming. He said he’s busy tonight and you should rest first.""  
""I see."" Celeste replied softly.  
She hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.  
his tone was indifferent as usual. ""I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow—""  
A woman’s voice chimed in: ""Trevor, who is it?""  
Wynn.  
Celeste gripped the phone tighter.  
""No one important,"" Trevor answered her.  
Before Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.  
Celeste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.  
After so many years of marriage, he’d always been cold. Distant. Impatient.   
She had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn’t bother.   
Perhaps she was just too tired.  
  
The next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.  
There was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.  
She didn’t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.  
Yet, Trevor didn’t answer.  
A long time later, he texted: What’s up?  
She replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.  
Trevor answered: Okay. Send the address.  
Alright, she typed back.  
That was it. No acknowledgment. No “Happy birthday.” She wasn’t surprised. But it still stung.  
As she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.  
""Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?"" Hannah asked.  
""Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She’s always mean to Wynn.""  
""Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That’s hurtful.""  
""I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?""  
Celeste froze.  
She had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.  
Celeste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.  
And now, Jordyn didn’t even want her as her mom anymore.  
Celeste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.  
Now, it seemed unnecessary.  
She walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she’d brought.  
Later, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.  
Celeste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.  
Her arrival was nothing but a joke.  
  
After a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.  
By noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn.   
Then, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch’s canceled.  
Celeste stared at it.  
She should’ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.  
Once, she’d cry. Today, she just felt… empty.  
Celeste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.  
Aimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.  
Just as she was about to walk in, she saw them.  
Trevor. Jordyn. Wynn.  
Wynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.  
What a happy family of three!  
So this was his ""something came up.""  
And this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.  
Celeste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.  
  
Back at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.  
Trevor had been her teenage dream—but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming’s pressure, he never would’ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.  
For a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo—her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn’t seem to want her.  
That was it.  
She was done—with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind—and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!  
She sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she’d been avoiding for months.  
The line rang once. Twice. A click.  
“Hello?”  
She took a breath, steady and sharp.“That offer still stand?”“I’m in.”  
...  
At around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.  
Jordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.  
But Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.  
Reluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.  
Still worried, she muttered gloomily, ""Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?""  
""She won't,"" Trevor replied confidently.  
In all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.  
In Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.  
""Sure, sure,"" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. ""Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.""  
Trevor took the envelope and asked casually, ""Where is she?""  
""Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?"" Hannah responded.  
Trevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. ""Has she gone back?""  
""Yes.""  
Why had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.  
Jordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.  
Polishing the seashells made her hands hurt—she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.  
Though it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.  
She couldn't help but say, ""Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.""  
Hannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.  
""Angry?"" Trevor repeated in his mind.   
In his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.  
Trevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.  
Back in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.  
A short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.  
That night, Trevor didn't return home.  
The next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.  
…  
Right after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.  
After their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.  
However, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.  
In contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.  
Most of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.  
Given this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.  
Now, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.  
She left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.  
Celeste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.  
Now, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.  
After a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.  
…  
The shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.  
When she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.  
Ever since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.  
At first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.  
The alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.  
Smiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.  
…  
Meanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.  
He noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.  
Jordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.  
She grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.  
Hannah hurried after her. ""Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!""  
Jordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!  
…  
After getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.  
The next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.  
Zeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.  
He was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.  
Anyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.  
To get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.  
Her initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.  
At first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries.   
On the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.  
Over the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.  
Something must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to—it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.  
While he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. ""I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.""  
""Alright."" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.  
After working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation.   
""Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing—""  
Although Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.  
But as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.  
And indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.  
Even when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.  
When Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.  
Trevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.  
Seeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. ""What is it?""  
Zeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, ""Oh, it's nothing.""  
Since Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.  
With that resolved, Trevor ended the call.  
…  
""What are you thinking about?"" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.  
Celeste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. ""Nothing.""  
""Don't you need to call your daughter today?""  
""No, not today.""  
Typically, she called Jordyn twice a day—once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.  
Her colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.  
After work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.  
After dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition.   
After that, she made a call. ""Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.""  
""Are you sure?"" the person on the other end replied coolly. ""The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.""  
The annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.  
Their company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.  
""If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,"" Celeste promised.  
There was silence on the other end before the line disconnected.   
Celeste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.  
Though she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.  
Her colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.  
While Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.  
So, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.  
For the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.  
Celeste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.  
…  
Meanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.  
That day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.  
Wynn had told her some bad news. ""I'm going back to the country soon.""  
Devastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. ""Dad, did you know about this?""  
At his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. ""Yes.""  
""When did you find out?""  
""It's been a while.""  
""Dad, you're so mean…"" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. ""I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!""  
Trevor's tone remained even. ""It's already being arranged.""  
Jordyn didn't understand. ""W-What do you mean?""  
""We're going back next week.""  
Jordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. ""Really?""  
""Yes, really,"" Trevor replied.  
""Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?""  
""It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.""  
Jordyn was ecstatic. ""Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?""  
""Alright.""  
""You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!""  
After hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.  
After a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.  
But after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.  
At first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.  
After all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.  
As Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.  
But just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.  
This thought dampened Jordyn's mood.  
It was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.  
Although Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.  
When Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.  
Celeste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.  
Hannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, ""Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.""  
Feeling relieved, Celeste replied, ""Thank you.""  
When Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.  
After Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, ""I accidentally hit the call button.""  
Hannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.  
Jordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.  
After hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.  
The envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.  
On the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.  
""All set. Let's go.""  
The Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.  
…  
That night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight.   
Jordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.  
After putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty—Celeste wasn't there.  
Just then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage.   
Loosening his tie, Trevor asked, ""Where is she?""  
Peter replied, ""Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.""  
Half a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.  
Now that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.  
This time, she had been gone for over two weeks.  
""Alright,"" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.  
...  
The next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.  
Trevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.  
He passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.  
In the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him.   
Even if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.  
But now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.  
Trevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.  
Watching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.  
Having resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.  
Half an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. ""Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.""  
In the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.  
When she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.  
But she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.  
Even when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.  
Only on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.  
This time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.  
The door to his office was ajar.  
As she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.  
Celeste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.  
Upon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.  
Trevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, ""Who allowed you to come in?""",3,1753532502.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,2,1.0,False

I’d swiped through Muzz for weeks, premium subscription and all, only to find robotic replies and checklists disguised as profiles. Beauty or brains, never both. I was one uninspired “lol” away from deleting the app when her like popped up—a tiny spark in the digital void. Curious, I liked back, figuring I’d give it one last shot.

Her name was Lila—at least, that’s what I’ll call her. Our first chat lasted an hour, words flowing like we’d been friends for a decade. No small talk, no family ultimatums, just two people riffing on life. By day two, we were deep into The Dark Knight quotes, debating whether Harvey Dent was a hero or a hot mess. Day three, we swapped Instagram handles, and the floodgates opened. Cinema, religion, politics, parenting, even our mutual love for spicy biryani—everything clicked, like we were two puzzle pieces from the same box. Ninety-five percent match, I told myself, grinning at my phone like an idiot. She was sharp, educated, a little out of my league with her fancy degree and family business. I figured my gym-honed biceps and quick wit evened the score.

We moved to WhatsApp, and it was electric. Late-night texts turned into love-bombed novellas. I wrote her a sappy poem about star-crossed vibes; she sent back a Suits reference that had me cackling. Every buzz of my phone felt like a hit of dopamine. I’d get antsy when she was offline, but her replies were instant, articulate, perfect. “Is this what soulmates do?” I wondered, half-joking, half-hoping.

The voice call was our first reality check. Her laugh was softer than I’d imagined, a little hesitant, but we traded embarrassing stories—my failed attempt at skateboarding, her spilling coffee on a client. It wasn’t texting’s fireworks, but it was warm, real. I was still all in.

Then came the meetup. A cozy café, the kind with mismatched chairs and the smell of fresh croissants. I spotted her by the window, her face familiar from Instagram but somehow… different. We ordered lattes, played Jenga, and I tried teaching her chess. She knocked over the king, laughing, but the air felt flat, like a soda left open too long. No butterflies, no banter, just two introverts fumbling through silence. I didn’t feel her energy; she didn’t feel mine. We fist-bumped awkwardly and parted ways.

Ten minutes later, her text lit up my phone: “Not feeling it, sorry.” I typed back, “Same,” and that was it. No heartbreak, no longing—just a weird void where the spark should’ve been. Like we’d built a castle in the cloud, only to find it was smoke. Online, we were perfect. In person, we were strangers.

Was it the app’s fault, hyping up a connection that couldn’t survive daylight? Or do some sparks just fizzle when you try to hold them? What’s the weirdest way online dating let you down?",1,1753532451.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

This is one of the best piece of fanfic that was written in the last year. All you can ask for is there. You wanna cry? You will. You wanna laugh? You will. You wanna blush? You will. You wanna gasp? You will. You wanna fall in love with every character? You will. EVEN THE DOG.

It’s one of the most unique worlds and storyline I’ve seen. This is not a typical hunger games/squid games fic, there is so much more to it, so much depth and unique elements tying it together; the end of the world vibe, the fog, the civil war, the dog, the mystery part of it (iykyk). We have plot twists, we have magic, we have combat, we have foreshadowing and full circle moments, we have intricate feelings of numbness, loyalty, humanity, grief and love. The imagination that went behind writing this is wild.

It is, truly, a hidden gem. Don’t avoid it like I did! 

If you need to know some information before going in (HEA, the dog, etc.), read the notes before chapter 1, the author is very transparent about everything you could be worried about.

1m9rwoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m9rwoh/what_is_the_coolest_neighborhood_in_pittsburgh/,What is the coolest neighborhood in Pittsburgh?,"I recently moved to Pittsburgh and spent months exploring every corner of this incredible city. After checking out all the neighborhoods, I have to say - the South Side is hands down the coolest area in Pittsburgh.

What makes South Side special is its perfect blend of history and modern culture. The main drag, East Carson Street, stretches for about 15 blocks and is packed with everything from craft breweries to vintage shops. The architecture here tells stories - many buildings still have their original Victorian-era facades from when this was a bustling industrial hub.

I discovered an awesome way to get oriented with the South Side (and Pittsburgh in general) through this double-decker bus tour I took [https://athometouch.com/pittsburgh]. It gave me a great overview of not just South Side but all of Pittsburgh's key neighborhoods. The guide shared fascinating bits about the area's steel mill history and how it transformed into today's entertainment district.

The South Side's character really comes alive at night. The street fills with people hopping between unique bars and restaurants. During the day, you'll find locals browsing through independent bookstores, grabbing coffee at quirky cafes, or climbing the famous South Side Steps for incredible city views.

One of my favorite spots is the South Side Works, an outdoor shopping and entertainment complex built on old mill grounds. It perfectly represents how this neighborhood preserves its industrial heritage while embracing modern development.

Speaking of history, don't miss the South Side Slopes area. These steep hillsides are lined with historic homes built for mill workers, connected by Pittsburgh's famous city steps. It's like an outdoor museum of the city's working-class roots.

The food scene here is incredible too. You'll find everything from traditional Polish pierogies to modern fusion restaurants. The Strip District might be Pittsburgh's official food neighborhood, but South Side gives it serious competition.

If you're planning to explore South Side (or Pittsburgh in general), I highly recommend starting with that bus tour I mentioned. It helped me understand the neighborhood's context within Pittsburgh's larger story, and the upper deck offers amazing views of the city's architecture. You can book it here: [https://athometouch.com/pittsburgh]

Trust me, once you spend some time in South Side, you'll understand why it's considered Pittsburgh's coolest neighborhood. It's got that perfect mix of history, culture, and modern energy that makes a neighborhood truly special.

I've lived in several cities, but there's something unique about how South Side balances preservation with progress. Whether you're a history buff, foodie, or just looking for a good time, this neighborhood has something for everyone.

Remember though, the best way to appreciate South Side is to first understand its place in Pittsburgh's story, which is why that comprehensive tour was so valuable for me when I first arrived.",1,1753532295.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

1m9rwel,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1m9rwel/i_was_never_going_to_fit_in/,I Was Never Going to Fit In,"It's been hard for me thinking that I didn't leave sooner when I realize some things that would always create dissonance between me and the Mormon church. Not only it's teachings but it's culture. 

""Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law."" (1 Corinthians 14:34). I was never going to be quiet, I'm a very outspoken person especially when it comes to defending what I think is right. 

“Women of God can never be like women of the world. The world has enough women who are tough; we need women who are tender. There are enough women who are coarse; we need women who are kind. There are enough women who are rude; we need women who are refined. We have enough women of fame and fortune; we need more women of faith. We have enough greed; we need more goodness. We have enough vanity; we need more virtue. We have enough popularity; we need more purity.” (Margaret D. Nadauld, “The Joy of Womanhood,” Ensign, Nov. 2000, 15). I'd like to note that the meaning of this is not how my mother interpreted it. But she had no problem with thinking that I needed to be weak and soft and pliable. No thanks for the fact that 90% of the yardwork and heavy lifting was done by me. It was a argument that would always be contradictory to her. Be soft, unless I need you to move things. 

""For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man."" (1 Corinthians 11:8-9). I was not made for a man, I will not be treated as such. I am not subservient. When I had first left the church and had moved out of Utah, there was a guy talking to one of my friends, friends. He told her ""women are at the mercy of men"". I had not been there when he said it, because if I had heard it I would've kicked his ass, and then would've pinned him while saying ""who's at the mercy of who right now?"". The girl he said this to was missing both her hands to a birth defect. 

I couldn't find anything on this, polygamy... If I got married no one could convince me nor force me to be one of many wives. And if I found out my husband tried to keep another wife from me, I'd bury him. God, the Prophet, anyone really could not command me to do this. My fury would not go unnoticed and if need be I'd wage war against the very Almighty God himself (if you think that's crazy, I would not stop until I win... There is no outer darkness that I would not come back from... There is no getting rid of me, I'd be like a cockroach, and I'd be relentless). 

Growing up in Utah was weird, I didn't notice this until I was older because there were no other ethnic people to talk to. But I realized that there was only certain people that would go on a date with me, and I only went on like three dates in high school because I wasn't attracted to these people (they were like brothers to me it was weird). But as I've gotten older I've noticed that these people had closeted porn addictions and fetishes, or were trying to rebell against their families (good for them ig). People didn't want to date a brown girl in Utah. And on top of this, I can't believe I didn't notice this. It only became clear to me after I got out of my very abusive household. My adopted female caregiver (the Kracken) was extremely racist (I was adopted by a white family), she didn't even know my race. But she would always be like you got to find a nice Polynesian husband. Or any guy that was brown. It was just so weird to me, and she tried to pressure me into a culture that wasn't mine. I did know growing up knowing though that I was part Puerto Rican. And one day I did my makeup a certain way and she asked, ""are you trying to look latina"". And I was like bitch I'm Puerto Rican, I don't have to try to look it. She also bullied my sister's ex boyfriend telling him that she was going to get him and his father deported even though they were US citizens. Also in the MTC I had people that would wrongly guess my ethnicity, and I'd constantly be correcting people.

""Honor thy father and thy mother"". I respect those who respect me. And I'm not going to be lead by people that act like children and never grew up. 

My adopted shitheads, also when I was 13 and my best friend tried to end her life told me that she was stupid. I've never disagreed with them before this, and I'd never been so angry with them. 

I hate the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, I absolutely hate them, and church music... And EFY songs, and David Archuleta. This music is like nails on a chalk board to me, or someone playing with styrofoam. Needles in my ears. I'd much rather listen to Papa Roach, Eminem, Elvy the God, Kid Cudi... Just please no Mormon music 😭. I also hated Youth Choir, like dear God my voice was not meant to be so insulted (my voice was made for screamo, blues, jazz, or rap). I did find out my biological Dad is half African American. 

My Grandpa was a convert from Catholicism. He and my grandma we're married at 16(M) and 17(F). He didn't convert until later, and he did it for her. But he always drank coffee until the very end. I loved the smell. And on my mission a Sister that I lived with let me try Pero (a coffee substitute), it was so fucking good. I don't drink coffee much now, but I love iced coffee every now and again. I also on my mission tried energy drinks for the first time, whenever I was being bullied by people in the mission I'd buy Chinese food or Sushi and I would get an energy drink (I tried every drink I could get my hands on). 

I had one memory of my biological mom growing up and it's weird because just by smell I can tell exactly what type of cigarettes she smoked. Marlboro, reds, 100s. She doesn't smoke anymore. But anytime the Kracken would stick her nose up to someone smoking, I'd be enjoying the aroma. 

I've always wanted tattoos and piercings. And I have some pretty cool ideas... Too many to share 😅. One tattoo I want to get is a Jack of Hearts on my wrist. My grandpa died of cancer when I was 18. They called him jack even though his name was John. And it's in hearts, because he'll always have my heart. There was this one time that my mother was criticizing someone outside a grocery store, she was like ""I feel sorry for her, just look at those tattoos""... Before she said this I had already been admiring her tattoos, like she was so beautiful 🥹.

I climbed on my Harley Softtail Deluxe and backed it out of the garage. Maddox got on behind me, and we took off for the school. I was hugging the curves and flying low. Maddox loves speed. Parked out in front of Pine Grove Elementary, I asked “You have everything, right? Homework? Lunch card? Inhaler? Maxi pads?” He grinned and said “You’re such a dork.” Then he walked off, dramatically sighing “Ohhh nooo! I forgot my maxi pads.. AGAIN!” I started the bike.. laughing at his antics, and made my way to the diner. I walked into a pretty big breakfast crowd, for a Thursday. I smiled and told Ashley good morning.. before checking on my line cook and chef. She smiled and said “I’m leaving at noon.. but I have Tammy coming in to cover you. The doctor wants to run some labs.. he’s worried about congenital diabetes with this baby. Seems he’s bigger than he should be.” I asked “Even for a wolf? Does your doctor know you got knocked up by a wolf?” She shushed me and said “No one knows, Delaney! I only told you because you would have smelled it anyway.” I made a face “Eww. When you say it like that, it sounds creepy.” She giggled “Dude! It IS creepy!” I laughed at her and my wolf, Iris huffed at her. I set about rolling silverware for lunch and dinner.. and Ashley asks “Hey! Did you hear about the motorcycle club moving to town?” I shook my head and she continued “They bought that five hundred acres with those old campgrounds. Wolf warriors or something.” I perked up “Wolf warriors? Do you think? Could it be Warrior Wolves? That club that has mostly rejected wolves as their members? If so.. this town just got a whole lot safer. They’re feral rogue hunters.” She shrugs and tells me “Well. I’m sure I don’t know. There was just a biker in this morning.. at the asscrack of dawn. Before I even got coffee started.. saying his club was moving to town and he was just hanging out.. waiting on Mr. Donaldson over at the bank.” Again, I nodded. Not that I don’t care.. because I do. A bike club would bring in a lot of business.. and that can only help me out! I smiled at Ashley and said “Hey! Fresh meat! For all you know, your future ex-husband is a member.. a Biker AND a Wolf? Mega jackpot, right there!” She cracked up and responded “You just can’t help it, can you? Do you make a conscious effort every morning to be a prick, when you crawl out of bed?” I laughed and said “Heck no! That just comes naturally!” Making her laugh, again. I asked “Did you remind Tammy she’s on her own from three to six? It’s Thursday.. and Maddox has training.” She said “Oh! No! I will text her right now.” She looked around for her phone.. then said “Give me your phone.” I laughed “Lost it again, did ya?” and handed her my phone. She muttered shut up and texted Tammy. She handed my phone back and said “You have a message from Maddox’s teacher.. something about maxi pads.” I choked on my own spit. That boy! I texted her back.. explaining it was just a joke between Maddox and myself, and I would take care of it. I went to the kitchen to see if Chef needed my help prepping for dinner.. but he said no. I have line cooks for the standard daily fare. But Chef works Thursday through Saturday evenings.. for a more substantial, upscale cuisine. It works well for the people in town. We got through lunch, and Ashley took off for the doctor. Congenital diabetes, my left tit! That baby is half wolf.. he’s going to be bigger! I left at 2:45 to grab Maddox from school.. and hurried home. We changed into our black combat clothes.. and I threw the duffle bag in the back of the Jeep. I drove out to the old abandoned farm we had found our first weekend here. I had set up a training ground for Maddox to hone his weapons skills. I don’t know if Marcus is coming for us.. but my little brother will not end up like my mother! Getting out of the Jeep, I asked “What do you want to work on first?” He shrugged and told me “Archery.. I’m better at that, than knives. And katana is always saved for last! It’s my favorite!” I grinned and said “Mine, too!” We ran our routines.. and I am so impressed with his accuracy and agility. His speed is increasing, too. His instincts are good and he never freezes. I grinned and said “Next week, we will start on moving targets. You have gotten good enough, we need to step it up!” He laughed “Yeah. I still don’t want to run the course blindfolded.. like you do. I don’t have that extra boost to my senses, that’s all you!” I told him “You have extra something, Buddy Roe! You’re accurate, as heck.. and fast. Your instincts are on par with a wolf’s.” I took him home to have dinner and do his homework. Mrs. Sutton from across the street came to babysit, until I closed the diner. Back at work, I was restocking the cooler and Tammy said “About time you made it back! I had a rush at four. Was in the weeds for an hour!” I straightened up and looked her over “You realize I am the person who signs your paycheck, right?” She nodded and I snarled “Then what gives you the right to use that tone with me? I won’t tolerate disrespect Tammy! From anyone!” She sneered “You know what?! I don’t give a heck! I quit! That new M.C. is taking applications for club girls. Free room and board. A clothing allotment and two hundred cash a week!” I laughed and asked “You’d rather be a club doll than work in my diner? I wish you luck, young one! I hear initiation is tough!” She scoffed “Not a doll, you idiot. A club girl.” I busted out laughing..” Never been around a bike club, have you? Well! I wish you luck. Now, get your stuffand clock out. I will have your final check cut in ten minutes.” I texted Ashley that we have to run an ad.. I need a new server Chapter 2 Maddox wanted to spend the day at the diner with me.. so I brought him to work. I had texted his best friends’ mother to see if Hunter could join Maddox for an afternoon matinee.. I know he will get bored.",1,1753532058.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Say something in the comments and I’ll share.,"I gave up my twenty-billion-dollar inheritance and cut ties with my family, all for my boyfriend of five years, Ignatz.

But just as I was about to tell him I was pr\*\*nant with our child, he dropped a bombshell.

He needed me to take the fall for his childhood sweetheart, Everleigh. She'd been in a hit-and-run, and her career couldn't handle the scandal.

When I refused and told him about our baby, his face went cold. He told me to terminate the pr\*\*nancy immediately.

""Everleigh is the woman I love,"" he said. ""Finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her.""

He had his assistant schedule the appointment and sent me to the clinic alone. There, the nurse told me the procedure carried a high risk of permanent infertility.

He knew. And he still sent me.

I walked out of that clinic, choosing to keep my child. At that exact moment, a news alert lit up my phone. It was a glowing article announcing that Ignatz and Everleigh were expecting their first child, complete with a photo of his hand resting protectively on her stomach.

My world shattered. Wiping away a tear, I found the number I hadn't called in five years.

""Dad,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I'm ready to come home.""

Chapter 1  
""What did you just say?""

The question hung in the air of our minimalist apartment, the one I had designed. My voice was barely a wh\*\*per.

Ignatz Turner, my boyfriend of five years, didn't even look up from his phone. He just repeated it, calm and matter-of-fact.

""I said Everleigh needs you to take the blame. It was a hit-and-run, Gen. A minor one, nobody was seriously hurt, but her career can't handle a scandal right now.""

I stared at him, at the handsome face I had loved for so long. Now, it looked like a stranger's.

""You want me to say I was driving her car? That I hit someone and fled the scene?""

""It makes sense,"" he said, finally lifting his eyes. They were cool, rational. ""You're a private person, an architect. You don't have a public image to protect. You can handle the heat. Everleigh... she's fragile.""

My hands started to shake. ""Fragile? Ignatz, she broke the law. What about my record? My career?""

""It won't affect your career,"" he said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Our lawyers will handle it. A fine, maybe some community service. It's nothing.""

I felt a cold anger rise in my ch\*\*t. ""Nothing? Ignatz, do you have any idea what you're asking? I left my family for you. I gave up my name, my inheritance, everything, so we could have a normal life away from their influence. I did that for you.""

""And I appreciate that, Gen, I really do,"" he said, his voice softening. He stood up and came toward me, trying to take my hands. ""That's why I know you're strong enough to do this one more thing for us. For me.""

He was close now, his familiar scent filling my senses. It used to comfort me. Now it made me sick.

""There's something else,"" I said, my voice trembling as I backed away from his touch.

He stopped, a flicker of annoyance crossing his face. ""What now?""

""I'm pr\*\*nant.""

The words came out, quiet but heavy. I had just found out this morning. I had been planning a romantic dinner to tell him, to celebrate.

Ignatz froze. His charming expression vanished, replaced by a look I had never seen before-a cold, hard panic.

""No,"" he said.

""Yes. I took a test. I'm six weeks along.""

He ran a hand through his perfectly styled hair, pacing the room. ""This is a disaster. An absolute disaster.""

I laughed, a broken, hollow sound. Tears I didn't know were there started streaming down my face. ""A disaster? It's your baby, Ignatz.""

""Everleigh can't handle this right now!"" he snapped, turning on me. ""The stress of the accident, her anxiety... finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her. She's not strong like you, Gen. She needs my full support.""

""So I'm the one who gets sacrificed? Again?"" The words were squeezed out from between my teeth. ""My life, my reputation, and now... our baby?""

He stopped pacing and looked at me, his eyes now holding a chilling sort of pity. ""We can't have this baby. Not now.""

My world tilted. The floor felt like it was dropping out from under me. ""What are you saying?""

""I'm saying you need to terminate it,"" he said, his voice dropping to a low, persuasive tone. ""It's for the best. For everyone. Once this all blows over with Everleigh, we can try again. It's just... bad timing.""

The air left my lungs. He was talking about our child like it was an inconvenient appointment to be rescheduled.

""It's your child, Ignatz,"" I whispered, my voice hoarse. ""Your bl\*\*d.""

""And Everleigh is the woman I love!"" he yelled, his composure finally cracking. ""She's sensitive! This would break her! Can't you understand that?""

I just stared at him, my mind a blank wall of pain. After a long, silent moment, a sad, twisted smile formed on my lips.

""Okay,"" I said. ""Okay, Ignatz.""

Relief washed over his face. He didn't see the emptiness behind my eyes.

Just then, his phone rang, a cheerful pop song I recognized as one of Everleigh's hits. He answered it immediately.

""Leigh? Hey, baby, what's wrong? Don't cry, I'm on my way. I'm coming right now.""

His voice was a gentle, loving ca\*\*ss. A voice he hadn't used with me in years.

He hung up and grabbed his keys, not even glancing at me as he rushed to the door.

""I'll have my assistant schedule the appointment for you,"" he said over his shoulder. ""Just do it quickly.""

Then he was gone. The door clicked shut, leaving me in a silence that was louder than his shouting.

The next day, I was at the clinic. The air smelled of antiseptic and quiet despair. The nurse who took my information looked at me with pity in her eyes. It made my skin crawl.

She handed me a clipboard with a consent form. His signature was already there at the bottom: Ignatz Turner. He had signed it this morning, before he even knew if I'd agree. He was so sure of me.

""The doctor wants you to know,"" the nurse said softly, avoiding my gaze, ""that due to a minor complication, this procedure carries a high risk of future infertility. There's a chance you might not be able to conceive again.""

The clipboard slipped from my numb fingers and clattered to the floor.

He knew. He must have known. The doctor would have told his assistant, and his assistant would have told him. He knew this could leave me barren, and he still signed the form. He still sent me here to erase our child and my future.

I bit down on my lip, hard. The coppery taste of bl\*\*d filled my mouth, but I felt nothing. Just a vast, cold emptiness.

I was ready to go through with it. To just get it over with, to cut out the last piece of him inside me. I stood up to follow the nurse.

And then I felt it.

A tiny, unmistakable flutter deep in my womb. It was too early for a real kick, the doctor had said. But I felt it. A flicker of life, a silent protest.

Don't let me go.

""No,"" I said, my voice loud and clear in the quiet room.

The nurse turned, surprised.

""I'm not doing it,"" I said, pulling my arm away. ""I'm keeping my baby.""

I walked out of that clinic, leaving the consent form on the floor. The afternoon sun was blindingly bright, and for a moment, I felt a surge of strength. I had my baby. That's all that mattered.

Then I pulled out my phone. The screen lit up with a breaking news alert from a celebrity gossip site.

The headline was a punch to the gut: ""Everleigh Hooper and Boyfriend Ignatz Turner Expecting First Child! Sources say Hooper is overjoyed after a recent health scare.""

The article was filled with pictures of them from last night, leaving a fancy restaurant. Ignatz was holding her, his hand placed protectively on her flat stomach. They were both smiling, glowing for the cameras.

Below the article, the comments section was a sewer.

""Who is that Genevieve Ball person? The one who did the hit-and-run in Everleigh's car? Probably some obsessed fan Ignatz felt sorry for.""

""I heard she's been stalking him for years. Good thing he's finally with someone on his level.""

""She looks so plain. Of course he chose a star like Everleigh. And now they're starting a family! So happy for them!""

I bit my lip again, harder this time. I felt the skin break, the warm trickle of bl\*\*d down my chin. But I still couldn't feel the pain. I was completely numb.

I looked down at my own stomach, and a single tear rolled down my cheek and fell onto my hand.

""It's okay,"" I whispered to the tiny life inside me. ""I'll protect you. I promise.""

I wiped my face, my expression hardening. I opened my contacts and found my lawyer's number.

""I need you to draw up divorce papers,"" I said, my voice steady and cold. ""And I want everything I'm entitled to.""

Chapter 2  
When I got back to the apartment, the front door was slightly ajar. A knot of dread tightened in my stomach. I pushed it open slowly.

The sound of soft laughter drifted from the living room.

There, on the custom-made sofa I had picked out, sat Everleigh Hooper. Ignatz was sitting on the coffee table in front of her, feeding her a strawberry. She giggled and leaned forward to k\*\*s him.

It was a perfectly staged, in\*\*mate moment. And I had just walked in on it.

Ignatz saw me first. His smile faltered for a second, his eyes hardening. ""Gen.""

Everleigh looked over, her big, innocent eyes widening. She immediately shrank back against the cushions, making herself look small and scared.

""Gen, can you give us a minute?"" Ignatz said, keeping his voice low, as if I were an intruder. ""Everleigh isn't feeling well. I'll come to the guest room later.""

I let out a short, sharp laugh. ""The guest room? Ignatz, this is my apartment. My name is on the lease. If anyone should leave, it's her.""

He stood up, his expression turning pleading. ""Please, just for tonight. You know how she is. We grew up together, I've always taken care of her. She needs me right now.""

He was trying to appeal to the part of me that had always made excuses for him, for their ""special"" bond.

""I'll get her a hotel tomorrow, I promise,"" he said, his voice a low murmur. ""We'll sort this out.""

I didn't say another word. I just turned and walked to the spare bedroom, closing the door behind me.

I couldn't block out the sounds. A few minutes later, I heard their laughter again, louder this time, mixed with the sound of the TV. They were settling in for the night. In my home.

I curled up on the bed, not bothering to change. The tears I had held back all day finally came, soaking the pillow in the dark.

Much later, I heard the bedroom door creak open. A shadow fell across the bed.

""Gen? Are you awake?"" It was Ignatz, his voice a guilty wh\*\*per.

He sat on the edge of the bed, his weight making the mattress dip. He reached out and touched my hair.

""I'm sorry about today,"" he said, his voice thick. ""It's just a lot to deal with. The baby... we'll have another one, Gen. When the time is right, I swear.""

I lay perfectly still, my body rigid. He didn't know. He thought I had gone through with it. He was apologizing for the inconvenience, not the monstrous thing he had asked of me. The irony was a bitter pill in my throat.

Suddenly, a sharp scream came from the living room. ""Iggy! Iggy, where are you?""

Ignatz shot up from the bed as if he'd been electrocuted. ""Leigh?""

""I had a nightmare!"" she wailed. ""Come back!""

Without a second thought, without another glance at me, he bolted from the room. ""I'm coming, Leigh! I'm here!""

For the rest of the night, the sound of his low, soothing voice drifted down the hallway as he comforted her, leaving me alone in the dark.

The next morning, I dragged my exhausted body out of bed. The smell of coffee and bacon filled the air. For a delusional second, it felt like any other morning.

Then I walked into the kitchen.

Ignatz was at the stove, flipping pancakes. Everleigh was perched on a stool, wearing one of his expensive silk shirts, her bare legs dangling. She was laughing as he playfully dabbed a bit of whipped cream on her nose.

They looked like a happy couple in a coffee commercial. I was the ghost haunting the set.

Everleigh saw me and her bright smile vanished. She instantly adopted her frightened-doe look, clutching Ignatz's arm. ""Oh. Genevieve. You're up.""

""Iggy,"" she whispered, loud enough for me to hear. ""I want orange juice. Freshly squeezed.""

""Of course, Leigh. Anything you want,"" Ignatz said, turning to the fridge without a single glance in my direction.

The moment he was busy with the juicer, Everleigh's entire demeanor changed. The fear melted away, replaced by a smug, triumphant smirk. She looked directly at me.

""He was so disappointed when he thought you were pr\*\*nant,"" she said, her voice a syrupy poison. ""He told me he never wanted kids with you. He said the thought of it made his skin crawl.""

I froze, my hand on the counter. My head snapped up to look at her. My fingers trembled.

""You think you can win?"" she continued, her voice dripping with contempt. ""I'm Everleigh Hooper. My uncle is one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood. Who are you? A no-name architect he picked up out of pity.""

My bl\*\*d ran cold. I knew her uncle was influential. I hadn't realized how much. That's why Ignatz was so desperate to protect her. It wasn't just love; it was ambition. She was his ticket to a world he craved.

Suddenly, Everleigh let out a sharp cry and slid off the stool, collapsing onto the floor. ""Ahh! My ankle!"" she shrieked, clutching it. ""Genevieve, why did you push me?""

Ignatz spun around, his face a mask of fury. He saw me standing near her, saw her on the floor, and didn't hesitate. He lunged forward and shoved me, hard.

""What the h\*\*l is wrong with you?"" he roared.

I stumbled backward, my hip slamming into the corner of the kitchen island. A sharp, searing pain shot through my side. I gasped, clutching the spot.

He didn't even notice. He was already on the floor, cradling Everleigh in his arms. ""Are you okay, Leigh? Did she hurt you?""

He looked up at me, his eyes filled with a cold, terrifying hatred. ""She's fragile, you id\*\*t! I told you that!""

""I... I didn't touch her,"" I stammered, the pain making my voice shake.

""Get out of my sight,"" he snarled, his voice low and dangerous. ""Don't you ever touch her again. I'm warning you, Genevieve.""

He scooped Everleigh up into his arms and carried her out of the kitchen, leaving me standing there, trembling with pain and shock.

My hand went instinctively to my stomach, a silent prayer that the baby was okay.

This was my home. And I had just been declared the enemy.

Chapter 3  
Ignatz didn't come back for two days. I spent the time in a daze, moving through the silent apartment like a zombie. I took down our pictures, packing his clothes into boxes. I even took off my wedding ring. It slid off my finger with no resistance. I had lost so much weight, I hadn't even noticed.

I dropped it into the tr\*\*h can. It made a dull, final thud.

Then, a text message from him lit up my phone.

Can you do me a favor? There's a blue velvet box in my top drawer. A courier is coming to pick it up in an hour. Have it ready for him.

I went to his drawer. Inside was a small, elegant box from a famous jewelry designer. I opened it. Nestled on the black velvet was a diamond necklace, the kind of ostentatious piece I would never wear. I remembered him showing it to me online months ago.

""Isn't it beautiful?"" he'd said. ""I'm going to buy it for the most important person in my life.""

I had thought he meant me.

Staring at the necklace, a bitter laugh escaped my lips. I closed the box.

When the courier arrived, a young man in a crisp uniform, I handed him the package without a word.

""Ma'am, the destination is the St. Regis Hotel,"" he said, confirming the details.

""I know,"" I said, pulling my purse from the hook by the door. I took out the folded divorce agreement. ""I'm going with you.""

The car ride was silent. The St. Regis was hosting a massive press conference for Everleigh's new movie. As we pulled up, I could hear the roar of the crowd and the frantic clicking of cameras.

I walked into the ballroom. The noise died down instantly. Every head turned. Every camera swiveled to face me. I was wearing a simple dress and no makeup. My hair was pulled back in a messy bun.

Whispers erupted around me.

""Is that her? The stalker?""

""What is she doing here? Look at how she's dressed. No class.""

I ignored them all. My eyes were fixed on the stage at the front of the room, where Ignatz and Everleigh were standing, holding hands.

Ignatz saw me, and his face tightened into a knot of anger. ""Genevieve? What the h\*\*l are you doing here?"" he hissed as I approached.

I didn't answer. I just held out the blue velvet box.

""You forgot this,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady.

Everleigh snatched the box from my hand and opened it with a g\*\*p of delight. ""Oh, Iggy! It's beautiful!""

She turned to him, pouting. ""Put it on me. Right now.""

Ignatz hesitated for a fraction of a second, his eyes darting between me and her. Then, his face hardened, and he took the necklace. His fingers brushed against her skin as he fastened the clasp.

Everleigh leaned in and ki\*\*ed him full on the lips, her eyes locked on me the entire time. It was a declaration of victory.

I stood there, silent.

Then, she did it again. She let out a tiny g\*\*p and staggered, pretending to lose her balance. ""Oh!""

""Gen, I warned you!"" Ignatz roared, lunging forward to steady Everleigh. He glared at me, his face contorted with rage. ""Are you trying to hurt her?""

I said nothing. I just held out the divorce agreement I had been clutching in my hand.

He barely glanced at it. Everleigh suddenly clutched her stomach. ""Iggy, I don't feel well. My stomach hurts.""

""What?"" His attention snapped back to her, all thoughts of me and the papers gone. ""Okay, baby, okay. Let's get you to the hospital.""

""The papers, Iggy,"" I said, holding them out again. ""Sign them.""

""Just sign it so she'll leave!"" Everleigh mo\*\*ed, pressing herself against him.

Without even reading it, he snatched a pen from a nearby table, scribbled his name on the line, and shoved the document back at me.

Then he swept Everleigh into his arms and started pushing his way through the crowd of reporters. ""Let us through! It's an emergency!""

I clutched the signed papers to my ch\*\*t and turned to leave. As I walked away, someone deliberately stuck out a foot.

I went down, hard.

My head hit the marble floor with a sickening crack. The world exploded in a flash of white-hot pain.

I heard gasps from the crowd. Through a haze of pain, I saw Ignatz stop and look back. He took a half-step toward me, his face a mess of confusion.

""Iggy, let's go!"" Everleigh whined, tugging on his arm. ""She's just faking it for attention.""

He looked from me, lying on the floor with bl\*\*d starting to pool around my head, to her. He hesitated for one more second.

Then he turned and left, disappearing into the flashing lights of the paparazzi.

I lay there, the polished floor cold against my cheek. My vision was blurring. People were staring, whispering, pointing. No one moved to help.

With a gr\*\*n, I pushed myself up. My head was spinning. I realized my wedding ring was gone. It must have flown off when I fell. The ring that had been so loose on my finger. A symbol of a marriage that had been hollow for a long, long time.

I didn't even look for it.

Ignoring the stares and the cameras, I stumbled to my feet, my legs shaking. I walked, one foot in front of the other, out of the ballroom and into the street.

I flagged down a taxi. The driver's eyes went wide when he saw the bl\*\*d on my face.

""Hospital?"" he asked, his voice full of alarm.

I wiped a smear of bl\*\*d from my cheek with the back of my hand.

""Yeah,"" I said, a grim smile touching my lips. ""But I'm not gonna die.""

Chapter 4  
The emergency room doctor was gentle as she stitched the gash on my forehead. ""You need to be more careful,"" she said, her brow furrowed with concern. ""A fall like that could have been much worse, especially..."" She trailed off, glancing at my chart.

Before she could finish, the TV in the corner of the waiting area, which had been murmuring quietly, suddenly blared to life with a ""Breaking News"" graphic.

My face filled the screen. It was a grainy cell phone video of me on the floor of the ballroom.

""Sources inside the St. Regis claim Genevieve Ball, ex-girlfriend of mogul Ignatz Turner, staged a dramatic fall today in an attempt to win him back,"" the anchor said in a grave voice. ""This comes on the heels of new reports alleging Ms. Ball has a history of erratic behavior and infidelity.""

The world went dark at the edges. I gripped the side of the hospital bed to keep from fainting.

Before I could even process the slander, the door to my curtained-off cubicle was thrown open with a deafening bang.

Meredith Turner, Ignatz's mother, stood there, her face a mask of pure fury.

""You little wh\*\*e!"" she screamed, lunging at me. Her hand connected with my cheek in a vicious slap that sent my head ringing.

Before I could react, two large men, bodyguards I recognized, grabbed my arms. They hauled me off the bed, ignoring the doctor's protests.

""What are you doing? She's my patient!""

""Get out of the way,"" Meredith snarled at her, and they dragged me out of the hospital, my bare feet scraping against the pavement.

They threw me into the back of a black SUV and drove to an old, abandoned warehouse on the industrial outskirts of the city. They dragged me inside and threw me onto the filthy concrete floor.

""Kneel,"" Meredith commanded, her voice echoing in the cavernous space.

I tried to scramble away, but the bodyguards forced me down. My knees hit the cold, hard ground with a painful crack.

Meredith pulled out her phone and dialed. ""Ignatz,"" she said, her voice dripping with venom. ""Your pathetic wife is here, making a scene. She's brought shame on our entire family.""

I could hear Ignatz's panicked voice on the other end of the line. ""Mom, what did you do? Where are you?""

""Don't you worry about it,"" she sneered. ""I'm just teaching this little tramp the lesson you've been too soft to teach her. You can't be this soft, son. She's been cheating on you, playing you for a fool!""

""Ignatz!"" I screamed, desperate for him to hear me. ""It's not true! I'm pr\*\*nant! She's lying!""

There was a pause on the other end. Then, Ignatz's voice came through, low and defeated. ""Gen... just do what she says. I'll make it up to you later. I promise.""

The line went dead.

Hope died with it.

They left me there, kneeling in the stifling heat of the unventilated warehouse. Sweat and bl\*\*d trickled down my face, dripping onto the dusty floor. Hours passed.

Then, a sudden, sharp cramp seized my abdomen. It was a pain so intense it stole my breath. I looked down. A dark, wet patch was spreading on the thin fabric of my dress.

No. No, no, no.

Panic, raw and primal, clawed at my throat. I scrambled to the massive steel door and banged on it with my fists.

""Help! Please, somebody help me! My baby!""

I could hear Meredith's voice from the other side, cold and dismissive. ""What baby? That little ba\*\*ard? Let it die. It was never welcome in the Turner family anyway.""

""It's Ignatz's baby!"" I shrieked, my voice cracking with desperation. ""It's your grandchild!""

The only answer was the sound of her footsteps walking away, fading into silence.

I was alone.

I spent the night on that cold floor, bleeding in the dark, the pain in my belly a relentless, tearing agony.

When the sun came up, the door finally opened. One of the bodyguards looked down at me, his face impassive. ""Mrs. Turner said we can take you to a hospital now.""

The next thing I knew, I was on an operating table. The lights were too bright, the voices around me were muffled. I felt a profound coldness spreading through me, a sense of something precious being irrevocably lost.

As they wheeled me into a recovery room, my phone, which had been in my purse, buzzed on the bedside table. It was a text from Ignatz.

I'm so sorry, Gen. Mom went too far. But you have to understand her position. This has been so hard on all of us.

A single, hot tear slid from the corner of my eye and traced a path through the grime on my face. My fingers trembled as I picked up the phone.

A few hours later, a lawyer I didn't recognize delivered a crisp, white envelope. Inside was my divorce certificate, officially stamped. It was over.

I scrolled through my contacts, my thumb hovering over a name I hadn't called in five years. A name that represented a life I had thrown away.

I pressed the call button.

It rang twice.

""Well, look who it is,"" a deep, male voice said, laced with a familiar, teasing smile. ""I was beginning to think you'd forgotten all about me.""

""Kaleb,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I need help.""

""I know,"" he said, his tone instantly serious. ""I'm already on my way. Dad's with me. Just hang on, Gen. We're coming to bring you home.""",2,1753532019.0,Novelnews,12,1.0,False
1m9rtia,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m9rtia,Should I dye this sweater?,"I have been struggling a lot with this sweater, which is the fourth thing I have ever knit. Getting the bottom ribbing to look correct took a lot of trial and error, as well as getting the correct stitch count to make a women's S/XS (I started out with way too many stitches and had to tear it out and re-do) but I am finally happy with it knitting-wise. However, now I am not so sure about the colors. My original plan was to alternate burnt orange 100% wool with leftover 100% wool Noro Ito yarn from several previous projects to use up scraps, but I'm not sure that I am liking the way the orange and other colors interact. I was hoping the orange-brown would make the overall effect more unified and muted, and that the sweater would have an autumnal vibe, but to me the stripes are just looking rather garish and not like fall tones at all. If anything, the yellows and pale greens and pale greys pop even more against the orange- in my opinion in a bad way. Now I am thinking of dying the finished sweater with a brown dye of some sort (RIT? coffee?) to make the entire thing a little bit darker, more muted and more unified color-wise. Thoughts? Is this a terrible idea? Anybody else try something similar? I have just struggled with this sweater too much to want to end up with a finished product that I don't even like enough to wear!!

#  

# “Roger, Tower, runway 2 south, over and out.”

#  

# I watched from the control tower as flight 0745 appeared through the early morning mist above London and made its approach, the time was 06:50 am.

#  

# The fully laden plane a Boeing 747, had just flown in from the USA, it was carrying 524 passengers and 15 crew members. 

#  

# It landed perfectly and taxied into its respective parking place, the ground crew took the stairs across and put them into position and waited.

#  

# Normally, the cabin crew would have opened the door to let the passengers disembark, but for some reason, this did not happen. 

#  

# So, the foreman of the ground crew, climbed the stairs and banged on the closed door, there was no reply.

#  

# He radioed in to his boss asking him for guidance, his boss in turn, called the tower asking us to try a call the plane on the radio.

#  

# This I did, repeatedly for about fifteen minutes, but to no avail, finally, in desperation, I suggested calling Maintenance, to see if there was a way to open the door from the outside.

#  

# Minutes later a truck from the workshop pulled up alongside the Boeing 747, looking like a toy beside the giant aircraft. 

#  

# Two aircraft technicians climbed up the stairs to the side of the plane, then they bend and started to do something to the door.

#  

# A minute later, the door opened, the foreman of the ground crew climbed the stairs and pulled the door and called into the opening, but there was no reply. 

#  

# The foreman spoke to me, and I called security, and requested them to make their way to the plane, stating “Code Bravo. Repeat. Code Bravo. This is not a drill”.

#  

# Two security cars made their way across the tarmac, their orange magnetic beacons flashing to show any aircraft in the area that they were crossing the runways.

#  

# The cars pulled up beside the 747 and four figures in uniform got out and after conversing with the foreman of the ground crew, they ascended the stairs.

#  

# One by one they disappeared inside the plane, there was a tense silence for a couple of minutes, then the cockpit radio crackled next to me.

#  

# I quickly picked up the radio and said, “flight 0745, can you hear me.?”

#  

# The voice of the head of the security team answered, “Tower, this is Felix, please advise local police to attend asap. This plane needs to be isolated straight away. is there anywhere it can be moved to, so it is out of sight of prying eyes.”

#  

# I responded, “Roger that, Felix. Police enroute, is there anyone else needed, medical.? ETC”

#  

# Felix was the codename for the head of the airport security team. Felix responded, “negative, tower. We just need to get this bird under cover.”

#  

# I quickly liaised with the ground crews and got flight 0745 moved into an empty hanger, by which time the police had turned up in force. 

#  

# The police cars drove into the hanger and parked surrounding the plane, two police officers climbed the stairs that had been positioned by the plane.

#  

# All they had been told was there was a serious incident happening at the airport involving flight 0745, but nothing else.

#  

# They stepped into the plane and looked around at the large, cavernous space, the senior officer, Geoff Spencer, spoke to Felix.

#  

# He said, “Why have you called us out here to show us an empty plane.?”

#  

# Felix said, “well, that’s the problem, when it left the USA twelve hours ago, it had 539 people on board, including the daughter of the American president, she was flying incognito.”

#  

# Geoff swore and said, “are you being serious.?”

#  

# Felix looked back at him with cool grey eyes and said, “I would never joke about anything this important.”

#  

# Geoff swore again and said, “right, I’m going to have to kick this upstairs, fast. This is way beyond our paygrades.”

#  

# Geoff had his officers search the plane, to no avail, then they put a cordon around the outside of the hanger.

#  

# Geoff then phone his boss and informed him of the situation, his boss, Gordon Barnes, immediately went white and called the Commissioner for the metropolitan police.

#  

# The Commissioner, Margaret Cooper, phoned Downing Street and asked to speak to the Prime Minister, on a matter of highest urgency. 

#  

# The Prime Minister interrupted her breakfast to take the phone call, she was not too happy about it, Catherine Wright, took the phone and said, “Speak, and this better be important.”

#  

# When Catherine Wright heard the news, she turned pale and swore several times, she jotted down as many facts as were available and said, “OK, thanks for letting me know, I’ll have to call Jim Hoover and tell him that we have managed to lose his daughter along with 538 other people.”

#  

# Catherine Wright checked her watch, calculated the time difference between here and Washington DC.

#  

# Asked the maid, Mary Hudson, for more coffee and proceeded to call and wake up the most powerful man in the world.

#  

# Catherine Wright checked her watch, took a deep breath, and picked up the secure phone and called the President of the United States of America.

#  

# After two rings, the phone was picked up by one of the security staff on night duty, Catherine Wright explained who she was and said that it was imperative that she spoke with the President immediately. 

#  

# The secret service man told her that it was three am and asked what was so important that it justified waking up the president at this time of the morning.

#  

# Catherine said, “it is a highly personal matter, but it is of the utmost importance. I need to speak to him now.!”

#  

# The secret service man, put her on hold and radioed up to one of his colleagues on duty outside the Presidents bedroom, and relayed the message that the Prime Minister of the UK needed to speak to him urgently.

#  

# Ten minutes later, the President was sitting in his dressing room, a cup of coffee in front of him, as Catherine Wright broke the news to him that somehow, everybody on flight 0745 had vanished during the flight.

#  

# The bottom fell out of Jim Hoover’s world as he heard the news, his nineteen-year-old daughter Emily, was studying at Oxford University.

#  

# To keep Emily safe, she was using the name Sandy McManners, the US had issued her with all the official papers she needed to travel and study abroad without a large security detail.

#  

# Up until now, this had worked. But now, somehow despite all of their efforts, she and 538 other people had vanished without a trace, how was this possible.?

#  

# Jim shook himself mentally and wished for the millionth time that his beloved wife Belinda was still alive, he needed her wisdom and warmth more than ever now.

#  

# He called his chief of staff and had him call an emergency meeting at four am. Then he quickly got dressed and phoned his in laws to inform them of their granddaughters' disappearance. 

#  

# Then he phoned his own parents and told them the same, he promised both sets of grandparents that he would keep them informed of any developments as they happened.

#  

# Jim Hoover took the lift down to the Situation Room and took his seat, the secret service team had already briefed to kitchen about the early emergency meeting, so, they had produced plenty of coffee and toast ETC.

#  

# When the rest of the cabinet staff arrived, Jim Hoover was sat at the head of the table, a half-finished coffee in front of him and a picture of his late wife and his daughter in his hand.

#  

# The last member took his place and then silence fell over the room, all that could be heard was the ticking of the old grandfather clock in the corner.

#  

# After what seemed an age, Jim cleared his throat and spoke, he said, “ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for calling you here at such an ungodly hour, but a situation has arisen.

#  

# Yesterday afternoon a plane took off from Washington Dulles airport bound for London Heathrow airport. It arrived this morning at 06:50 GMT. 

#  

# It was carrying 539 passengers and crew, but when it landed, the plane was completely empty, everybody on board had vanished,

#  

# It was a direct flight, there were no stop offs en route, so, it is impossible for everyone to disappear like this.”

#  

# There was a babble of voices around the table, Jim Hoover stood silently watching them, when the noise died down, Jim continued, “one of the passengers was my daughter, Emily, she was travelling incognito. 

#  

# So, ladies and gentlemen, do you have any ideas about how they could have disappeared.?”

#  

# Meanwhile back in the UK, Catherine had called her own meeting of COBRA, after explaining what happened that morning at Heathrow Airport, she opened the floor for any suggestions.

#  

# A rather nondescript man wearing a black leather jacket and blue jeans said, “the first thing to do is to put a very tight ring of security around the hanger that the plane is currently inside, if you want, I can get some of my boys down here within the hour.”

#  

# Catherine nodded and said, “thank you Captain Hinde, that would be most helpful.”

#  

# Captain Hinde took a phone from his pocket, dialed a number, and spoke quietly into the phone, thirty seconds later, he hung up, nodded at Catherine, and said, “Done, a Chinook is picking them up in ten minutes, so they’ll be here in about 45 minutes.”

#  

# Other suggestions were mentioned, two of them were, check the black box, flight recorder to see if that picked up anything about what happened on the flight. 

#  

# The other suggestion was to check the overhead satellites to check the plane’s flight path to see if that could give any clues.

#  

# After the meeting was concluded, the air crash investigators at Fareham UK were contacted and were asked to send an investigator to Heathrow to remove the black box and analyse the contents of it, but to keep it a closely guarded secret for now.

#  

# In America, they had decided to investigate the personal details of the pilot and crew of flight 0745, while others were checking every inch of its flightpath, by satellite.

#  

# The air crash investigator from Fareham arrived at Heathrow and was escorted to the hanger by two heavily armed police officers, 

#  

# which was the second indication that something was wrong, the first was when the investigatory team couldn’t find any news of a crash at Heathrow.

#  

# To get into the hanger they had to pass through a ring of men dressed in black overalls, wearing full facemasks, and carrying machineguns.

#  

# Once the investigator entered the hanger, he asked one of the police men, “who were those men outside.?”

#  

# The police man gave a grim smile and said, “they are the hooligans from Hereford.”

#  

# The investigator, David Parry, said, “who.”

#  

# The police man said, “SAS”

#  

# David Parry gulped and turned to look at the plane, it was an American Airline Boeing 747. He climbed to stairs and under the watchful eye of the police officer, he removed the black box, flight recorder.

#  

# This done, he got the Police officer, Barry Roberts, to sign the papers, stated that he had watched David Parry remove the black box from flight 0745.

#  

# David Parry then returned to Fareham to check the black box, he connected it up to the mainframe computer and started downloading the information, once he had taken a backup of the information.

#  

# He called his boss into the room to listen to the play back, the first couple of hours of the flight were silent, then they heard the various control towers picking them up as they flew into their airspace. 

#  

# Then there was some radio chatter, but nothing between the pilot and co-pilot, there was no interruptions by the cabin crew bringing them food or drinks.

#  

# There was nothing on the black box from when they left Dulles Airport, nothing from the control tower, or any others that should have spoken to them until they passed them out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

#  

# This news was passed back to the team at Heathrow, they found this strange as well, so, they started checking the plane more thoroughly.

#  

# The head of the flight maintenance team, Joe Rice, called his opposite number at Dulles Airport asking for the records for the last time the plane was serviced.

#  

# After they received clearance from their bosses, they faxed the information over to Joe Rice and his Team, who immediately started checking everything on the plane. 

#  

# One of the first things they checked were the engines, listing down the serial numbers, and general condition, etc. 

#  

# These serial numbers were compared with the numbers listed in the maintenance log that had been received from Dulles, they didn’t match. 

#  

# So, Joe left his office and checked the numbers himself, they didn’t match, he even took a photo so he could double check when he got back to his office.

#  

# Back in his office, Joe downloaded the pictures onto his computer and checked them, the numbers definitely did not match, 

#  

# then he noticed something that he hadn’t seen while looking at the engines, they were covered in a light coating of sand. 

#  

# Joe thought this was strange, because America Airlines didn’t usually fly into any Arabic countries, so, he phoned back to Dulles Airport.

#  

# He said to his contact, “have you sent me the details of the right plane.?”

#  

# His contact, Earl Martell, said, “yes, why.?”

#  

# Joe said, “Well the engine serial numbers don’t match up. Plus, do you guys fly to sandy countries by any chance.?”

#  

# Earl paused for a moment and then said, “yes, they are the details of the right plane, and no, you are correct, American Airlines don’t fly to any sandy countries, why?”

#  

# Joe quickly emailed Earl the pictures he had just taken of the engines of the 747 that had landed at Heathrow that morning.

#  

# Earl swore and said to Joe, “Hey buddy, can you sit on this for a while, like ten minutes.?”

#  

# Joe said, “not really, my guys are climbing over the plane at the moment, and they are going to spot something very soon.”

#  

# Earl said, “ok, tell your bosses now, I’ll do the same here. Good luck, the shit is about to hit the fan.”

#  

# Just as Earl predicted, the shit really hit the fan, both here in the UK and in the USA.

#  

# At Heathrow, the maintenance crews climbed all over the 747 with a fine-toothed comb, checking everywhere. 

#  

# After about an hour of searching, an urgent call came over the radio, “a body had been found in the electronics chamber, which was located by the front baggage hold.

#  

# Access to the chamber was made by lifting a metal hatch in the passenger deck and descending a steep metal ladder into the front baggage hold, then through that via a panel into the electronics chamber.

#  

# The body was examined in situ, before being removed to the moved to the mortuary at Hounslow for post-mortem.

#  

# This was carried out by Dr Shirley Hooper, she started the post-mortem at 10:30 am, she started off by stating her name and the names of her two assistants, Karen Nolan, and Derek Lancaster.

#  

# They started by weighing and measuring the body, the Dr Hooper spoke into the overhead microphone, “the body is that of a well-nourished white male, approximately thirty years of age, 

#  

# There are no visible signs of injuries present on the body, there are a few old scars, these will be photographed and noted, some of these scars look medical in origin,

#  

# Samples have been taken for testing; the brain has been removed for scanning for any signs of cancer or tumours.

#  

# The stomach contents show that the last meal that was eaten was chicken and rice, note to self, check with America as to what the pilot ate before the flight. 

#  

# Derek Lancaster made a note to remind himself to check with the Americans, finally the post-mortem was completed, the incisions were sewn up, and the body was placed into a refrigerated drawer to await whatever fate awaited it.

#  

# In America, the flight crews' personal histories were checked into, right back until they left high school, the pilot, Captain James Boyle the third, was a former pilot in the USAF. 

#  

# He had served for ten years and left with the rank of Major, he had been with American Airlines for twelve years and had an impeccable flying record. 

#  

# The co-pilot was Julie Craker, she had served in the USAF under James Boyle, she was a thirty-seven-year-old black woman,

#  

# She had been with American Airlines for eight years, again with an impeccable record.

#  

# All the cabin crew had been with American Airlines for at least five years, none of them had as much as a mark on their records for being rude to a passenger.

#  

# So, the FBI searched everything about the crew, their search revealed that one of the cabin crew was a lesbian, one of the others had downloaded child porn onto her computer, another one was having an affair.

#  

# But when they checked in to Captain James Boyle the third, they discovered that he was hiding a big secret, a massive secret, he was a closet Muslim.

#  

# For all the years that he had been in the USAA, and had been flying for American Airlines, he had been hiding this major secret from everybody. 

#  

# This news shook the FBI team to the core; a committed Muslim was flying the President’s daughter across the globe.

#  

# The news of this was sent straight to the White house and the message was passed directly to Joe Hoover, he held his head in despair.

#  

# The news sped across the Atlantic to Downing Street and the P.M called an emergency meeting of COBRA to keep them up to date on the latest developments.

#  

# The DNA testing had brought in a familial match, it was for a family living in Scarbough, the family was immediately put under surveillance.

#  

# Their data was accessed straight away, the father was called Brian Sale, he worked at the local garage as a mechanic, the mother was called Jane Sale, she worked as a secretary at the nearby hospital, 

#  

# they had three sons, one was called Colin, he was sixteen-year-old and still in at school, the middle son was called Michael, he was eighteen and studying electro engineering at university, 

#  

# the eldest was Ben, he was twenty-four, he had studied world religions at Oxford university, but had dropped out, converted to Islam, changed his name, travelled to Pakistan, and lived there for about three years, his parents had no idea of his current whereabouts. 

#  

# When Catherine Wright disclosed this piece of news, Captain Hinde said, “Clever, using a cleanskin.”

#  

# Catherine said, “I beg your pardon.?”

#  

# David Hinde said, “a cleanskin, a Caucasian person, who hasn’t been in trouble with the police, they can get into places that somebody of Asian heritage wouldn’t be able to, or at least not without a lot of attention being drawn to them.

#  

# I bet when this guy landed the plane, the air traffic controller who spoke to him didn’t notice that he didn’t have an American accent, but he certainly would have noticed an Asian accent.”

#  

# The dental records confirmed the identity of the pilot of the 747 at Heathrow was Ben Sale.

#  

# The next thing to do was the find out how the two planes had been switched mid-flight, so, every inch of the flight was scrutinised, both by the American’s and the British.

#  

# Both teams came to the same conclusion, the switch must have taken place mid-Atlantic, the last control tower that picked them up on US soil was in Nova Scotia.

#  

# The next control tower to speak to them would be in Ireland, so for several hours they would be out of radio contact with anyone.

#  

# So, the search was narrowed into the vast area of empty ocean, as one agent was heard to say, “this is like looking for a needle in a whole field of haystacks.”

#  

# The families of the passengers who had been on board flight 0745 were told that there had been a chemical leak on board, necessitating the immediate quarantine of all the passengers and crew. 

#  

# The quarantine would be of an indeterminate period, the families would be kept informed of proceedings. 

#  

# The search for the missing plane continued, meanwhile, the toxicology report on Ben Sales body found the presence of cyanide, 

#  

# So, it looked like he landed the plane at Heathrow, spoke to the control tower, taxied to the right place, parked, then climbed down into the electronic cabinet, took cyanide after cramming himself into a tight place to hide his body his body for as long as possible.

#  

# So, they now knew who had flown the plane into Heathrow, now they just had to find the missing plane with the 539 people on board.

#  

# Experts both in the UK and in America, searched the route taken by flight 0745 for days, then finally, they spotted the flight suddenly descend from 38,000 feet and disappear from the radar and just as suddenly climb back to its original flying altitude.

#  

# It happened so quickly and smoothly, that if you weren’t looking for it, it would have gone un-noticed.

#  

# The switchover had taken place close to the coast of North Africa, so now the American satellite pictures were very carefully scanned.

#  

# In the middle of the Western Sahara, is a small settlement called Bir Anzerane, it is a small trading post, but there is a large main road that runs past it.

#  

# The satellite pictures showed, parked on the hard packed sand beside the road, was a Boeing 747, bearing the livery of American Airlines.

#  

# They checked with American Airlines, no planes had been sold anywhere in the Western Sahara, plus there weren’t any airports in that area.

#  

# The plane had been found, now they had to find the passengers and crew. 

#  

# The surveillance teams now widened their search by five miles in each direction, but found nothing, so they expanded their search to twenty miles.

#  

# They found a large, tented enclosure not far from an oasis, a satellite was positioned above the camp so that they had a real-time picture of events. 

#  

# The footage revealed that there were approximately fifty armed guards, holding the missing passengers, the satellite focused in so closely that they could make out individual faces. 

#  

# Stills were saved from the live feed, and these were checked against the passport photos taken at Dulles Airport before the flight took off.

#  

# Within twenty minutes, a message was sent to Joe Hoover at the White House, one of his aides interrupted a meeting he was in to pass him the sealed envelope.

#  

# President Hoover took the envelope with shaking hands, tore it open and read the contents, he let out the breath that he didn’t know that he was holding.

#  

# And for the first time in about twenty hours, felt that there was a tiny glimmer of hope, he told the rest of the chiefs of staff at the meeting the good news.

#  

# Admiral Paul Mayfield, spoke, he said, “I’ll get the SEALs ready for action as soon as possible, Joe.” 

#  

# There were no ranks used in staff meetings. 

#  

# Joe Hoover said, “that’s a good idea, we had better link up with the intel boys to get some up-to-date data on what we’ll be facing.”

#  

# General Carl Cooper of the USAA, said, “I’ll get transport organised, I assume that any possible raid will have to take off from the UK, so, if the seals are ready, we can send them and the kit they need across the pond tonight so, they will be ready for action asap.”

#  

# Joe Hoover said, “I think that it would be a good idea to get the SAS involved, they are good at this desert fighting stuff aren’t they.”

#  

# The meeting concluded with an agreement to get the SEALs ready to fly to the UK that night, Joe Hoover phoned Catherine Wright and informed her about the rescue plan.

#  

# She immediately asked if he needed SAS assistance. 

#  

# He said, “of course, they would be a great help.”

#  

# So, it was decided, a four-man team from the SAS would make a HALO jump that night, to do a recognisance of the camp, the guards, and the prisoners. 

#  

# So that night, four men under the command of Scotty White, were taken by chopper to Heathrow and they boarded a flight ostentatiously headed for Paraguay, this necessitated a flight across the edge of the Western Desert.

#  

# Once they were over the desert, the four-man team jumped into the inky blackness of the desert sky.

#  

# HALO stands for “High Altitude Low Opening.” Tonight, they jumped from 35,000 feet, all were wearing oxygen masks and thick clothing to combat the freezing temperatures associated with high altitude.

#  

# They were dropped ten miles away from their target and using the guide ropes on the parachutes were able to steer themselves closer to their target. 

#  

# As soon as they left the plane, they could see the lights of the campfires marking their target, so they carefully steer towards them.

#  

# When the altimeter was reading 800 feet, they pulled the cords, and their pure black parachutes blossomed above them. 

#  

# They landed and quickly secured the area, one facing each direction, once they were sure that they hadn’t been discovered, Scotty got on the radio and sent a squirt message back to the UK, 

#  

# A squirt message is a message that has been compressed and encrypted then sent, it can encrypt the bible down and send it in a message less than 10 seconds long.

#  

# While he was sending the message, Dan Cotton, Billy Staverton, and Andy Broadman, was busy setting up a lying up position, and setting weapons just in case they got bumped.

#  

# They didn’t light a fire, they knew that they would be on hard routine, i.e. no hot food, or hot drinks, no smoking etc.

#  

# Before dawn, Billy, and Andy, made their way closer to the camp so they could get eyes on, to really log the comings and goings, it was hot lying in a scraped-out position in the sand under a canvas sheet, but they had been through worse.

#  

# After a long day of getting bitten by sand fleas, when the sun went down, Billy and Andy left the scrape and returned to the LUP.

#  

# The information they recovered was quickly sent back to the UK, meanwhile back in America, the SEALs were being flown by helicopter to Hurlburt Field, In Florida for the long flight to the UK aboard a C17 plane, the largest plane the US military possess.

#  

# In the UK, a plan was being made, the SAS were put on standby, the plan was for them to be dropped ten miles away from the camp, complete with land rovers and motorcycles.

#  

# They would land, travel across the desert to the LUP, rendezvous with Scotty and his team, then at three am, silently take out any sentry’s, take out any sleeping guards that they could, before it got noisy, i.e. somebody started firing.

#  

# The SEALs arrived in the UK, and the following day they were ready to board their flight to the Western Sahara, they were going to meet up with the SAS at the forward rendezvous point.

#  

# The SEALs would come in the left flank and the SAS on the right; the SAS took the side where the guard tents were situated. 

#  

# All went according to plan, the two teams crept into the camp like desert wraiths, drifting from shadow to shadow, leaving behind them a trail of bodies.

#  

# Finally, the two teams met at the outside of the prisoners' tents, they were being guarded by three guards, two of them were dozing, one was pacing nervously back and forth.

#  

# Finally, he left his post, walked behind a tree, and started to relieve himself, a shadow rose behind him and silently placed a hand over his mouth 

#  

# and stabbed him through the throat, then turned the knife and pushed the blade forward, ripping out his throat, without a throat, the guard couldn’t make a sound.

#  

# The other two guards were dealt with the same way, then after the camp was secured, they entered the prisoners' tents.

#  

# Inside they found that the prisoners had all been handcuffed the entire time they had be held prisoner, some of the female prisoners had been repeatedly raped. 

#  

# Inside the male tent, most of the male prisoners had been beaten, all had black eyes, and other marks of ill treatment.

#  

# In the female tent, they asked that Julie Craker could make herself known, a hand went up and a slim black woman rose to her feet.

#  

# The head SEAL introduced himself, he said, “ma'am, I’m James Butler, Lieutenant US Navy SEALs, can I confirm if you are able to still fly.?”

#  

# Julie forced a smile and said, “You bet your sweet ass, I can.”

#  

# James Butler made a call, and a fleet of Chinooks were soon on their way, Meanwhile the SAS were headed towards the town of Bir Anzerane, to take over the small settlement.

#  

# This was soon accomplished, and then they started refilling the giant 747 ready for take-off. Soon the chinooks started to ferry the passengers to Bir Anzerane, 

#  

# Julie Craker was among the first to board the plane, she quickly started the pre-flight checks as more and more of the passengers were boarding the plane.

# Among the last to board was a figure who was struggling against his handcuffs, it was a very disheveled looking James Boyle, the captain who had flown the plane when it had left Dulles airport.

#  

# He was unceremoniously dumped in a seat and was strapped into place using cable ties. As he kept swearing and cursing, one of the SEALs shoved a napkin in his mouth.

#  

# As the sun was rising, flight 0745 taxied across to the road, accelerated to take-off speed and lifted off into the morning sun, as the wheel lifted off the tarmac, there was a resounding cheer from the passengers.

#  

# As the plane reached cruising altitude, they were joined by a flight of Eurofighters from the RAF.

#  

# They escorted flight 0745 to Heathrow, as soon as they were within range of Ireland, the control tower said, “Welcome home flight 0745, We’ve missed you.”

#  

# They landed at Heathrow to a hero’s welcome, Julie Craker was treated like a heroine, the passengers were escorted off the plane and into a large room where they could phone relatives etc.

#  

# Emily Hoover was taken to a private room where she phoned her father for a very tearful reunion, but the meeting that James Boyle was in was not so pleasant.

#  

# He was taken from the flight, shove into a car with blacked out window and driven to Grosvenor Sq. in central London, to the American Embassy. 

#  

# In the basement are several rooms where rather robust questioning is carried out, these rooms are soundproof and as they are part of the American Embassy, they are classed as American soil, So the UK laws don’t apply there.

#  

# Back at Heathrow, Julie Craker was interviewed about what happened on the flight, during the flight, she was taking a nap, when James Boyle had suddenly turned the oxygen level down causing everybody on board to pass out, 

#  

# When she had awoken, she was handcuffed to her seat, and they were flying at about 200 feet above the sea, James was talking to somebody in a language that she didn’t understand.

#  

# After landing, he maneuvered the plane of the road he had landed on and onto the sand beside it, James then opened the door and several men entered the plane, they were carrying guns.

#  

# We were all taken off the plane and loaded onto lorries, driven across the sand until we reached the oasis, that is where they had set up a camp for us.

#  

# Her voice broke as she said, “during the time we were being held, all of the women were repeatedly raped.”

#  

# After hearing this, the woman talking to her, opened her arms and gave Julie a hug, as the two stood there, the tears were flowing, from both of them. 

#  

# The authorities made arrangements for all the women from the flight were given counselling to get them through the ordeal of 1, being held hostage, 2, being repeatedly raped. Each woman was also tested for any STDs.

#  

# Back in the Western Desert, the SAS and SEALs were clearing up before being extraction back to the UK, the bodies and camp were searched before the two teams left on the Chinooks.

#  

# Before they left, they removed any information they had gathered, then left a laser pointer in the middle of the camp, thirty minutes after they left, a missile guided by the laser pointer impacted in the centre of the camp obliterating everything within a 500-yard radius.

#  

# The chinooks landed back in Germany, refueled, and flew on to the UK. From there the SAS returned to Stirling lines at Hereford and the SEALs after a night's sleep, returned to their base in the USA.

#  

# The End.

I stayed on Thursday at hers and we went away for the whole day on Friday. I didn't think I'd be staying again but was very late when we got back. Basically didn't have a way back 

 She then came in saying she's gonna take tomorrow for herself. She asked will I get the bus. I said I'll probably get a lift. She said what time. I said I honestly don't know (explained about the person in getting a lift from). Then I said maybe lunch time? 
She said like? around 12? Anyway it felt awkward.

Today she got up and made coffee for herself I was on the couch. We said hi. Then we were on our phones. She said do you have any updates on the lift? Am I overreacting to her boundaries or was her delivery unnecessarily rude. I understand needing time for yourself but I felt the way she went about it was quite abrupt and cold.

Tldr; I fear I'm overreacting to what felt like my friend pushing me out ",0,1753531929.0,spirituality,4,0.5,False
1m9rsg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m9rsg3/can_you_drive_the_circumference_of_oahu/,Can you drive the circumference of Oahu?,"Just got back from an incredible Circle Island Tour of Oahu, and I need to share my experience. I've visited Hawaii multiple times, but this was hands down the best way to see the entire island in one day.

Many people ask if you can drive around Oahu's circumference - yes, you absolutely can! The island is roughly 112 miles around, and you can cover the main highlights in about 8 hours. While you could rent a car and do it yourself, I found that taking a guided tour was way more relaxing and informative.

I booked this Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall (https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island) after reading hundreds of positive reviews, and it exceeded my expectations. Our local guide knew every hidden spot and shared fascinating stories about Hawaiian culture and history that I would've missed driving solo.

The tour started in Waikiki early morning, which was perfect because we beat the crowds at popular spots. Our first stop was Diamond Head lookout - the views of the coastline were breathtaking. Then we visited Halona Blowhole, where waves shoot water up to 30 feet high through ancient lava tubes.

The North Shore was a highlight - we stopped at famous beaches like Sunset Beach and got to try the legendary garlic shrimp from local food trucks. Don't skip this, seriously some of the best food I've had.

Waimea Valley was incredible. The botanical garden has over 5,000 tropical plants, and the waterfall at the end is something else. Pro tip: bring your swimsuit. Swimming under a Hawaiian waterfall is bucket list material.

What really made the tour worth it:
- No stress about navigation or parking
- Expert local knowledge
- All entrance fees included
- Convenient hotel pickup/drop-off
- Small group size (max 24 people)
- Coffee and macadamia nut tastings included

Cost-wise, at $154 per person, it's actually pretty reasonable considering everything that's included. Plus, you can cancel up to 24 hours before if your plans change.

Final thoughts: If you're planning to explore Oahu, this circle island tour is the way to go. It's comprehensive, well-organized, and you'll see way more than you could on your own. Book through this link (https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island) - they often have special rates and I found their booking process super smooth.

Quick packing tips for the tour:
- Comfortable walking shoes
- Swimwear and towel
- Camera
- Cash for lunch and souvenirs
- Sunscreen and hat
- Water bottle

Trust me, this tour will give you the full Oahu experience in just one day. The combination of scenic spots, cultural insights, and local treats makes it worth every penny.",1,1753531918.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False
