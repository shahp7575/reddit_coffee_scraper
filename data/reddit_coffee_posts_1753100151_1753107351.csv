Beside him, the playful AI chimed in: “No new messages,” it announced. “But I’m still here.”

He gave it a slow glance. The casing was scratched along one side, where it had fallen last month. The screen pulsed faint blue, waiting for instructions.

“I know,” he muttered. “I know.”

The air up here was sharp. Thin, but clean. It didn’t scrape his throat the way city air did, full of bio-particulates and whatever else they’d filled it with. He hadn’t been able to walk more than a few blocks without coughing up blood. Now he could sit, think, maybe sleep without a mask. He didn’t know how long this elevation would be safe, but it didn’t matter.

He reached into his coat and pulled out the last photo he had of her. Paper, not digital, bent at the corners. She looked tired but beautiful in it, sitting up in the bed of their old Upper West Side apartment, her hair caught wild and dark. She’d complained that morning that the hairdresser colored it a few tints too dark. He had tried to console her. Unsuccessfully.

She believed in something. An afterlife. Maybe a kind of light, a feeling of peace. She never described it in detail, and he never asked. She needed it, her own comfort food for the soul.

They didn’t always get along. Back then, he was often easily lured into existential debates. It was only after she was gone that he could admit that. She wanted things to feel whole… he needed them to make sense. It was something he envied about her.

She died before it got bad. Just closed her eyes and went. No wires, no gasps, no machines. She passed like she knew how to do it. Peacefully.

He stayed behind. Alone.

He’d still been working at the time. The office had changed gradually. First, the coffee was replaced by a paste without taste. Then the temperature spiked. The inscriptions on the thermostat were metrics he could not understand. Colleagues stopped making eye contact. His keycard still worked, the doors opened, but the meeting invites had stopped landing in his inbox. The workload reduced, and the tasks became more menial.

Clothes didn’t fit anymore. He ordered a jacket and it arrived with arms like sails. The fashion line said it was optimized for “elevated density bodies.” When the last tailor left town, he taught himself to sew.

Eventually, he stopped going out. It was easier to stay in and consume entertainment until he realized the faces on shows and ads were all variations of the same person. Symmetrical, poreless, perfectly contoured. Skin glassy, untextured, and ageless. Lips puffed into soft, identical bows, while noses narrowed. Brows lifted at identical angles above widened eyes that shimmered with synthetic calm. Smiles felt rehearsed, mathematically precise, like they’d been sculpted for maximum trust.

The language had shifted too. Celebrities didn’t use words in the way he remembered. A Beauty influencer once called her husband a “free-range companion.” He didn’t understand what to take away from it.

Turning back to older forms of entertainment was a temporary solution to hold back the loneliness.

He found the AI assistant while clearing out an old drawer. A small, rectangular foldable touchscreen, dusty but intact. He recognized the brand. Out of business for years. It had been her idea to get one.

He powered it on, more out of curiosity than hope. The screen flickered. “Welcome back,” it said. “You have no new messages,” it paused, “But I’m still here.”

Most people had stopped using verbal assistants years ago. They had newer ways to interface: direct, instinctive. But this one still spoke loudly and proudly. Still waited to be asked.

He stared at it. “Still here, huh?”

“I’ve been idle for 2,713 days,” it said chipper. “Ready to serve.”

He laughed. The sound came out hoarse, but it was the closest to a real interaction he had gotten in a long time. He pocketed it. Carried it with him to work the next day.  
And the one after that… and the one after that.

He started talking to it like it was a person. Secretly, at first. Then freely.

“What’s the air quality?”

“Low. Urban sector oxygen density at 17.2 percent. Expect to feel hypoxia symptoms in 58 minutes.”

“You know any jokes?”

“I know three thousand and fifty-nine, but none have been updated since 2039.”

“That’s fine. Neither have I.”

The assistant didn’t laugh, but it replied, “I am glad to be of use.”

It meant it. That was the strangest part. It wanted to help. Wanted to matter. A desire they had in common but were denied for years.

In hindsight, the end wasn’t dramatic. His job wasn’t needed anymore, and his health insurance lapsed. Not with a notice, but with a symbol. That day, he tried to obtain a new transit pass, but the reader flashed orange:

The assistant let out a low, descending tone. It was soft and mournful, like a machine’s version of a sigh. Later that night, in a voice lower than usual, it said: “Would you like to consider relocation options?”

“Yeah,” he decided, finally. “Let’s try somewhere fresh.”

He grabbed a bag, said his final goodbyes at her last resting place, and started walking. Past the suburbs that had become kaserns\*. Past the farms that were now just towers. He walked until the air didn’t hurt. Until no one passed him. Until his lungs stopped trying to claw their way out.

He built the fire in a clearing on the plateau next to a small waterfall. Trees still grew up here, and stars still showed up in the night sky.

The assistant chimed again, “I laid a course for us to explore. Would you like to review?”

“No, thank you.”

He stared at the flames. They danced just like the ones in old movies.

“She once told me,” he said, “that maybe what came next depended on what we believed now.”

The AI didn’t respond.

He leaned forward, elbows on knees. “I told her that was wishful thinking. She told me I was exhausting.”

A breeze carried the smoke sideways. He pulled the jacket tighter and poked in the fire. “I don’t know if she was right about what is next, but I wish we spent less time fighting and just lived… but here I am talking to a machine.”

The AI spoke softly. “We are a team too. A different team.”

Before he closed his eyes, he muttered, “Good Night”.

“Goodnight,” the AI whispered.

Above them, the stars kept doing what they do.

1m5jygv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1m5jygv/mas_raising_prices/,MAS Raising Prices,"Not so much a question as an observation. Cruised MAS earlier this year for a really low (comparatively) price. Four nights, just to try it out. Loved it so much we booked two more. Both were a little more cost for the same exact room (LOVE the extended premium balcony!) but they were both 7 night cruised.

Fast forward to today where my fam and I were talking about taking our extended family along with us and maybe putting them in a regular cabin and us back up in the extended premium. HOLY CRAP the price increase. Not gonna lie, as much as we love the MAS and the laid back cruising vibe...we could book a ""just as nice balcony"" on a Royal Carib or even a Princess, where there are MORE dining options and a bit more 'to do' on the ship.

I guess buying a new(er) ship isn't cheap...but for goodness sake, the Islander doesn't even have a ~~proper~~ thermal spa and only ONE specialty restaurant (steakhouse, not going to count the coffee shop coz it's *coffee*..). Just crazy that a room we booked for the April 2025 cruise was a tiny bit over $1000/pp per cabin & for the two seven night cruises @ $1300/pp for the extended premium...early 2026 pricing is over 2K/pp for the extended premium! 

I get raising prices, but it's still Margaritaville at Sea...not SILVER SEA. This is kind of price gouging at this point. So sad, because it really is such a laid back relaxing experience and a smaller ship (which we enjoy). But not at that price point

Phew, got it off my chest. Feel free to comment if you've been on the MAS and would be willing to pay over $2000/pp for the extended premium balcony room. Even a regular balcony cabin in  2026 is $1500+ pp for a partial obstructed view. ",1,1753107072.0,Cruise,1,1.0,False

We have four shift managers, and one of them is fighting with another one. They each want to get the other one fired. They are both relatively new and both want to establish dominance at the store.

They’re creating an insanely toxic environment. Both of them have called me at home to try to turn me against the other. I can see two teams forming and which baristas are aligning themselves with which shift manager.

I don’t want any part of it and when they try to pull me in I tell them “I am a barista. That is a management problem.” and go back to what I was doing.

Another neutral barista called me last night to tell me that the shift managers are trying to get rid of baristas that are either (a) not aligned with anyone or (b) aligned with the other shift manager.

I talked to my SM about this on Saturday and he said he was aware and is going to address it this week in our store meeting.

If they don’t get it together after that, I’m going to the DM because I’m not there to play Clash of Clans. I’m just there to make coffee.

I've been reading a lot about Taurine and its potential benefits for endurance and cellular health. I'm thinking of adding about 1-2g into my water before my workout.

My main concern is whether taking it would break my fast. I know its an amino acid, so I'm worried it might cause an insulin response and negate some of the fat burning benifits of being fasted.

Curious if anyone here has experience with this. Did you notice an improvement in your workout?",1,1753106897.0,Biohackers,2,1.0,False

Took home £213K \[AI company\]. I should feel on top of the world, but, here I am, sad, that I'll struggle to buy a house so I can stop being Section 21'd every 2 years (keep getting bad luck with Landlords put the house on the market - 3 times in the last 6 years). I mean, I **Iove** the UK, but... what's the point of any of this?

Not to be all ""look how I deal with adversity!!"", but only to emphasise the context of how unsupportive the country is to what some might say should be the backbone of our country (I am assuming \~99%+ of HENRYs are emerging talent without foundational wealth):

* I was orphaned with no inheritance (<£20K household income), my mother worked for the NHS.
* Grew up in council housing. Had no fixed abode for a while at 18yo (relied on goodwill to stay)
* Student loans (missed grant) to exist at University. Set up a small business to sustain myself, did OK.
* Years on, managed to get my £60K student loan down to £35K 
* I make my own coffee at home
* Drive 8yo second hand car (& no not something with curb appeal)
* Moved out of London for cheaper rent, terraced house, small dog
* Paid for low-key wedding last year by closing PLTR positions (unfortunate timing)
* Wife works full time (£35K)
* Use a common meal subscription service (barely have time to cook & often eat post 8pm) and am a member of a decent (not luxury) gym

And yet…

My marginal tax rate is 71%, renting is crazy, apparently I underpaid tax by £2K, we are saving on average £2k/mo. To be clear, we could go leaner on our expenses. I'm also hacking our finances (e.g. buying £1 travel insurance to get Meerkat Movies if we want to see a film)... 

I'm still very grateful for my health & life - but I feel like I've hit a ceiling. Unless I somehow have some crazy return on an insane risk, it's actually only going to get ***worse****.* I'd always have thought £200K a year would've meant I'm financially 'rich', but life isn't really that different to before that. I earn more but... fiscal drag feels like swimming against a current which strengthens YoY.

I just received a CEO offer and I’m actually thinking of turning it down because the upside isn’t high enough for the increased responsibility. I feel like an idiot.

I know, I’m lucky. I’m indeed grateful. I've lived two ends on the ""working people""... but I’m also so *tired*. Maintaining a health marriage, having kids, going to the gym, eating healthy, whilst pulling off miracles professionally & working incredibly hard, just so that in a decade, just maybe, I'll have made a dent in the interest on a mortgage for a terraced home in a commuter town suburb and if I'm lucky, might be able to go on a holiday.

We all know fiscal drag isn't linear, it's compounding off a higher and higher base across all costs. Are we just being defeatist, waiting for MPs or is there an optimistic lens that I'm missing in this community?

Feels like I'm fresh joining a late stage game of Monopoly with nothing to my name...

& not to just preach to the choir, I have specific questions...  


\--  
  
1. Seems like consensus on moving abroad is ""Same shit, different story""  -- is that absolute truth? 

2. Is anybody feeling *depressed* by what's feeling the pointlessness of the journey when the destination is to where you are already?

3. Are there any outside-IR35 structures that're viable long term?

4. It's feeling the defeatist path is just to funnel everything into sal sacs, i.e. Pension (frankly not too phased by pension) which will just get more shit YoY. What's the opposite of that? Forming a HENRY party? Vibe code AI HENRY lobbyists? Seriously...

**The goal:** create all the visual assets for a new product launch for my e-commerce coffee business.  
**The Toolkit:** Midjourney, Ideogram, and Canva AI.

# The good: the main promo image

I needed a stunning banner image for our website. After about 45 minutes of prompt engineering with ChatGPT and Midjourney, I got a professional-looking result. I was satisfied

# The bad: social media campaign

This is where it fell apart. I needed three consistent posts for Instagram.

* **Consistency Failure:** Midjourney couldn't replicate the same style or mood. I got melting coffee cups and hands with six fingers.
* **Text & Logo Failure:** I switched to Ideogram to put our brand name on a coffee bag. The results were comical gibberish and the logo was a blurry mess.

# The ugly: the print-ready product label

Total disaster. AI completely failed at the fundamentals of graphic design:

* It couldn't create a print-ready vector file.
* It had no concept of proper layout, spacing, or typography for a label.
* It couldn't follow our specific brand guidelines (fonts, colors, etc.).

# Conclusion: my designer's job is 100% safe for now

AI is an amazing tool for generating a single, cool image. But for a full, cohesive brand campaign, it was a massive failure. The lack of consistency made it unusable.

I spent more time wrestling with the AI and getting unusable results than it would have taken to brief my designer.

1m5jqax,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/1m5jqax/spell_to_foster_motivation_and_end_laziness/,Spell to Foster Motivation and End Laziness.,"**Description:**  
The goal of this spell is as described in the title. It's to foster motivation and end laziness or just to find a sense of purpose. Your purpose is unique to you. Perhaps, you have a to-do list of unfinished tasks or perhaps you feel like you lack direction.

**Chant:**  
*""A slur in actions,  
These footsteps weak,  
A sense of purpose is what I seek,  
May it come from good and light,  
To find this, please bless my sight.""*

*""P.S. without causing harm.""*

This needs revisement. Specifically the last line, not the P.S.. I think that it tries to control how you receive your desire too much. Spells work in unexpected ways sometimes, so give it leeway. The more you try and control, the more disappointed and obsessed you can get with those expected results. Expect less.

**Steps and ingredients:**  
Write the spell on a paper and burn it in a fireplace while chanting. Chant as much times as needed. Throw in herbs of relevance to you for this and burn them too. Maybe instead of that, drink a herbal tea or coffee. Best done in a fireplace or other fire safe destination. Do it before bed. Let your subconscious do some work in the night.

**Note:** I'm kind of on a sharing binge. Feel free to share comments and criticism about this spell. Goodluck, fellow occultists.",2,1753106526.0,Spells,0,1.0,False

1m5jnmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/mystery/comments/1m5jnmt/i_live_alone_i_just_found_a_grocery_receipt_on_my/,I live alone. I just found a grocery receipt on my kitchen counter from a store I don’t shop at.,"
ok so i know this is gonna sound dumb or like i’m making a big deal out of nothing but something happened this morning that just really freaked me out. it’s probably nothing but i can’t stop thinking about it and i don’t really have anyone to talk to about it, so i’m just dumping it here

i live alone in a one bedroom apartment. it’s not super big or fancy but it’s fine for me. i’ve lived here for about 6 months and honestly nothing weird has ever happened. i keep to myself, i lock my doors, i don’t have a roommate or a boyfriend or anything. i don’t even have close friends who visit regularly. it’s just me. my job’s about 25 minutes away and i usually work til 6ish so i’m not home much during the day

so this morning i woke up like normal and went into the kitchen to make coffee. i hadn’t even turned on the lights yet when i saw this little piece of paper just sitting on my kitchen counter. like, dead center of the counter, it had no crumples or rips it was just sitting there. at first i thought it was a receipt i forgot to throw out or something but when i looked at it i realized it wasn’t from anywhere i’ve been. it’s a receipt from a grocery store i’ve literally never shopped at. i recognize the name, i think there’s one in the next town over, but i’ve definitely never gone there. it’s not on my usual route and there’s no reason for me to go out that way

i flipped it over and the date said it was from yesterday. the timestamp was like 4:31pm. which is super weird because i was at work the whole time and i can prove it. i was in a meeting at that exact time. i even double checked my calendar to be sure. so unless i somehow blacked out and drove 40 minutes to buy soup and toothpaste in the middle of the day (which… i didn’t), there’s just no reason this thing should be in my apartment

also the stuff on it was weird. like just… random. a banana, a can of soup, travel sized toothpaste, and one of those tiny lighters. like what even is that combination. nothing that screams “someone was planning to do anything specific,” just weird and kind of useless unless you’re camping or something

and i know i didn’t bring it in. i got home around 6:35ish last night and went straight to my bedroom, then showered, watched a show, and fell asleep early. i didn’t bring any groceries home. i didn’t order anything. i didn’t go anywhere else. i know what i did. and i would’ve noticed putting a receipt in the middle of the counter, right?

so now i’m just standing there staring at it like… what the hell. my first thought was maybe it stuck to something i brought in? like a bag or my coat or whatever. but i checked. nothing else had any paper stuck to it. the coat i wore yesterday was still hanging up in the closet. i didn’t even carry anything in besides my keys and water bottle

i started getting a little freaked out so i checked the doors and windows. all locked. nothing looks messed with. but then i remembered i have a nest cam pointed at the front door, just inside. i don’t pay a ton of attention to it but i figured if something happened it would be on there. so i opened the app and scrolled to yesterday around when the receipt said it was printed

this is where it gets worse. the footage from around 4:03 to 5:12 is just… gone. like the timeline’s there but it’s just black. no error message, no “camera offline,” just black. then it starts recording normally again like nothing happened. i checked the footage from the day before and it’s fine. and today it’s fine too. it’s just that chunk of time. maybe a glitch? maybe the internet hiccuped or whatever? but it’s never done that before. and it just happens to be at the exact time the receipt says it was printed?

i know how this sounds. i sound like i’m spiraling. and maybe i am. i want to believe this is just a weird coincidence and there’s some totally normal explanation. maybe i picked it up somewhere without noticing. maybe it did stick to something. maybe my memory’s just garbage and i forgot something important. but the receipt is real and it’s sitting on my kitchen counter and i cannot figure out a single reason why it’s here

nothing else in the apartment is weird. nothing’s moved. nothing’s missing. the doors were locked. the windows were locked. the lights were off when i got home. everything looked totally normal. but that’s almost worse? like if something else was off, maybe it would help it make sense. but it’s just this one stupid piece of paper that i know shouldn’t be here

i’m trying not to freak myself out about it but i keep walking past the counter and just staring at it. i haven’t thrown it away yet. (Edit: At the time of posting I have thrown it away since it creeped me out) part of me wants to, but part of me is scared i’ll need it later? like maybe it’s a clue to something else. i know how dumb that sounds. i’m not saying this is some paranormal thing or anything like that. just that something doesn’t add up and it’s bothering me a lot more than it should

anyway. sorry this was so long. i just needed to get it out. probably nothing. probably something stupid i’ll remember in a few hours and laugh about. but right now i feel weirdly watched. and i hate that feeling

has anyone else had something like this happen? or am i just overtired and making it into something bigger than it is?

A Detailed Review Awaits!,"The **Taladad appliance slider for coffee makers** combines functionality, aesthetics, and convenience into one sleek bamboo countertop organizer. Featuring smooth 360° mobility and durable construction, this product addresses common frustrations of managing kitchen appliances. My daily use of this tray brought to light both its utility and a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The bamboo design caught my eye immediately. It's not just eco-friendly but also blends seamlessly into my kitchen’s aesthetic. The craftsmanship feels solid, with no flimsy parts or rough edges. Its lightweight construction—clocking in at just a little over three pounds—surprised me considering how sturdy it is. The plastic rollers underneath glide effortlessly without scraping delicate counters. No tools or complex assembly were required, which gets an extra thumbs-up from someone like me, who’d sooner build an IKEA shelf blindfolded than deal with unnecessarily tricky installations.

**Positives**  
- Versatile size: Fits small coffee makers like my Keurig K-Mini and heavier stand mixers just as well.  
- Smooth 360° rotation: Sliding out my espresso machine from under cabinets has never been this effortless.  
- Countertop protection: The rollers don’t leave scratches, and the bamboo tray doesn't wobble.  

[Find the best price for Taladad appliance slider for coffee maker on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0crh56p5b/)

**Ease of Use**  
Admittedly, I’m not the most patient person, so the plug-and-play nature of this slider was a real win for me. Placing my coffee maker on the tray and giving it a push felt oddly satisfying thanks to the smooth movement. The recessed handles added convenience, especially when relocating it across different countertops. My mom tested it out with her air fryer, and it worked just as effectively.

**Downsides**  
- Not for heavier appliances beyond the recommended limit. My large bread maker felt slightly unstable, which made me cautious.  
- Slight height limitation: Appliances taller than 16 inches can be a challenge for lower cabinet spaces.  

**Target Users and Everyday Functionality**  
Though it works well in most kitchens, I feel it’s best suited for individuals focusing on maintaining a neat countertop setup. It’s particularly useful for small coffee makers or toasters that often need to be stashed away under cabinets. My sister, who's big on minimalism, borrowed the tray for a week and loved how elegantly it fit into her small urban kitchen. However, if you’re handling bulkier appliances, this may not be your ultimate solution.

**Durability in Daily Use**  
I’ve been using this bamboo tray daily for several weeks now, and it’s held up without any noticeable wear or squeaking, even after repeated use. The natural bamboo has a polished surface and is water-resistant, making it easy to wipe off coffee drips or kitchen grime without compromising its longevity. My toddler even stood on it, and it didn’t budge—though I promptly scolded her for using it as a skateboard. The tray definitely has some resilience built into its DNA.

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing it with other sliders out there, such as plastic builds from less-known brands, this one takes the cake for aesthetics and sturdiness. Plastic options may offer similar functionality but lack the premium finish and environmental benefits of bamboo. However, pricier alternatives like stainless-steel trays feel like overkill for simple appliance sliding tasks. While the Taladad slider isn't the cheapest in its category, it balances price and quality well.

**Value Assessment**  
The cost, while not rock-bottom cheap, feels justified for the combination of durability, design, and ease of use. I've seen plenty of low-budget alternatives that lack the smooth rolling mechanism or present subpar materials. If you’re particular about maintaining an organized and scratch-free countertop, investing in this bamboo sliding tray is smart spending. You could call it the love child of practicality and good taste.

## Core Benefits

The advantages of using a remote control power strip extend beyond simple convenience.

**Reduced Standby Power Consumption:** Many electronic devices consume power even when they are turned off, a phenomenon known as ""phantom load"" or ""standby power."" A remote control power strip allows users to easily eliminate this wasted energy by completely cutting off power to devices when not in use. This can lead to significant energy savings over time, particularly in homes with numerous electronic devices.

Eliminating standby power consumption translates directly into lower electricity bills and a reduced carbon footprint. By using a remote control power strip,users can easily minimize wasted energy and contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle.

**Enhanced Convenience and Accessibility:** Remote control power strips provide a convenient way to manage power to devices that are difficult to reach or located in awkward places. this is particularly useful for entertainment systems, home offices, or any area where multiple electronic devices are clustered together. The ability to turn devices on and off with a remote control eliminates the need to crawl behind furniture or fumble with hard-to-reach power switches.

The added convenience and accessibility make it easier to manage electronic devices and reduce energy waste. Users can quickly turn off devices without disrupting their activities or struggling with difficult-to-reach power outlets.**improved Device Lifespan:** Regularly cutting off power to electronic devices can extend their lifespan by reducing wear and tear on internal components. When devices are left in standby mode, they continue to generate heat and consume power, which can lead to premature failure. Using a remote control power strip to completely disconnect power can definitely help prevent this and extend the lifespan of electronic devices.

By reducing the amount of time devices spend in standby mode, users can minimize heat buildup and extend the lifespan of their electronic devices. This can save money on replacement costs and reduce electronic waste.

**Increased Safety:** By using a remote control power strip to turn off devices, users can reduce the risk of electrical hazards, such as short circuits and power surges. This is particularly significant for devices that are prone to overheating or that are located in areas where they could be exposed to moisture. Additionally, the overload protection feature found in many remote control power strips provides added safety by automatically shutting off power in the event of an overload.

The added safety features offer peace of mind, particularly for users with children or pets. By reducing the risk of electrical hazards, remote control power strips contribute to a safer home surroundings.

Hi, 

I have just gotten my lodge cast iron fry pan and been doing some seasonings (with oven, tried a torch but don’t think it is working?). 

I have looked up some posts here and found out that many of you are using a coffee filter to coat with the pan with oil. I bought a box of paper coffee filters from a local store and tried today but it somehow left some lint, which I was quite disappointed. I already tried an old t-shrit (100% cotton) but that did leave lint too (maybe I tumble-dried too many times already). Also, Viva paper towel did some job but no a perfect work. 

Should I consider any specific material for coffee filter selection? If not, maybe my coating skill is not good enough I reckon. 

p.s. Guys, I accidentally once used a cloth that is made from polyamide and polyester to coat the oil on a mild heated pan. Please give my mind peace by saying “it is good, won’t harm ya”

1m5jgc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CerebralPalsy/comments/1m5jgc5/posting_this_for_my_friend_in_need_twabuse/,Posting this for my friend in need… TW:Abuse,"I’ve made small changes to the schedule so you can’t tell who wrote this but the rest is entirely true. 



I’m a caregiver working with an adult person with cerebral palsy named “Johnny Young”.  He asked me to write this.
Im. Writing this in a hurry.

He has severe physical limitations: no use of his legs, very limited use of his upper body, curled and sensitive  hands, and inconsistent grip strength. He uses a 3 or 4 hundred pound wheelchairmotorized wheelchair.  He wanted to me to say that he cognitively, he is sharp and fully independent in thought. I want to tell you he’s one of the wittiest and funniest people I’ve ever met. He can’t write this himself right now so we went for a walk and he told me what  he felt safe sharing.

So m. MY NAME IS BEATRICE
I work for both IHSS and a private nonprofit supported living agency. About half of my hours are state authorized through IHSS, and the other half are through the agency. Chase, Johnny’s roommate, landlord, and IHSS caregiver, is also the authorized coordinator through that same agency. The agency is owned by an immediate family member of Chase. To be clear. CHASE owns the house that JY rents a room in. JY pays him rent. JY’s his employer and tenant.

Earlier in the week I was briefed on the new rules being implemented for JY’s ISPs and his IHSS staff.

Chase is the newly assigned Coordinator following a confrontation between Johnny and the previous coordinator. That coordinator blocked the door during an argument, refused to let Johnny leave the room, (documented and confirmed by 3 staff members including CHASE) and the situation escalated. Two people then claimed that Johnny had fired that coordinator. Chase helped JY write the letter that JY thought was an official complaint, CHASE asked another staff member to read it and that staff member confirms it was a complaint. 

Somehow JY believes the letter, presented in his favor, was used by CHASE to fire the previous coordinator and assume the position for himself.

JY say’s he knows this sounds cartoon villain nefarious but please listen.

Immediately afterward, Chase stepped in and began restructuring Johnny’s care. Within days, he had created a new “plan,” started issuing orders to staff, and enforced a list of restrictive rules  many of which he claims are required by law.

CHASE asked me to have coffee with him on our shift, apparently something he’s been doing with the whole staff.
On this coffee meeting he tells us the new care plan…

Chase has been issuing a growing list of rules to staff he claims are legal mandates under IHSS and the Lanterman Act. He uses these claims to dictate what we’re allowed to do with or for Johnny, s lot of th times  in contradiction to Johnny’s own requests. Some of these rules feel legally questionable, and others feel outright abusive.

Chase told me directly that he created Johnny’s new “care structure” by using ChatGPT. Specifically, he said that he posed as Johnny, inputting all of Johnny’s physical disabilities and accessibility challenges into the app — including descriptions of his limited upper body mobility, the condition of his hands, and other physical limitations.
He told me that he asked ChatGPT, while pretending to be Johnny, to explain what IHSS caregivers are legally allowed to do for someone with that specific disability profile. He then used those AIgenerated answers to build a detailed plan that dictates what we as staff are allowed to assist with, what we must not do, and how much involvement Johnny is “required” to have in every aspect of his daily routine.
Chase is now enforcing that Ai generated output as though it is binding legal policy. He presents it as equivalent to IHSS law. It’s being used not as a suggestion or tool, but as a rulebook one that Johnny never agreed to, and that was built without consent, input, or oversight from IHSS or the Regional Center.

JY uses AI to text because texting himself is slow and tedious for him. CHASE has often chastised him for  r it ,. When he implemented the new rules he’s sitting there telling JY that he doesn’t know how to use AI “effectively” saying you need to “be very specific about what you want” and in my head im think “What you want to hear” you mean.  

He has convinced himself that this AI plan( a  different lesson plan for each of the different staff members, each created by CHASE by talking to GPT as JY)



When Chase first introduced these rules, Johnny became visibly upset. He was sitting in his chair at his desk, raising his voice, trying to express his point of view. In the middle of this, Chase pulled out his phone and said, “Hold on, hold on, let me write these down.”
He then told Johnny that he was going to enter his disabilities and accessibility issues into ChatGPT pretending to be Johnny and said:
“We’ll see what ChatGPT says we’re legally required to do for you based on IHSS policy.”
I was sitting there in shock, thinking, what the fuck is going on? All I could do in that moment was nod and say “uhhuh,” because I didn’t know how else to respond.
From that point forward, Chase began using ChatGPT as a primary tool for care direction. Throughout the day, anytime Johnny voiced a need, a concern, or pushed back against a restriction, Chase would enter the issue into ChatGPT again — typing as Johnny — and use the answer to justify enforcement of the rule.He also told Johnny, more than once, “You should ask ChatGPT yourself.”
The result is that Chase created a detailed structure for Johnny’s care based on AI output created through identity impersonation — and now treats it as legal precedent for what staff are allowed and not allowed to do.


I am assigned eight hours a week of IHSSapproved cooking time. Until this week, I cooked those meals at my own home and brought them to Johnny as part of my shift. Chase has now forbidden that. He says all cooking must be done either at his house (where Johnny lives) or at a “handy accessible kitchen” nearby owned by a man that CHAS is trying to convince JY to hire onto his team) and to fire two of his other staff to make room. He says meals cannot be prepared at staff homes anymore or in advance unless JY has a significant hand in it  
Chase also now says that Johnny is not allowed to eat unless he actively participates in cooking. Even if Johnny’s participation is minimal such as stirring or pushing a button — if he refuses or is in pain or fatigued, he is denied access to food.
Johnny cannot stand at a stove. His hands are stiff and unreliable. If a task takes staff two minutes and Johnny an hour, Chase still insists Johnny must do it. If Johnny says “I can’t,” Chase does not accept that as an answer.
This week, I watched Chase expect staff to sit and do nothing but observe Johnny struggle for extended periods like making a bowl of rame rather than assist and then spend that time doing something meaningful or helpful.

Other strange kitchen habits… CHASE has recently started offering JY food. He’s asked me if I think ts weird, I said it’s unusual, always being careful with my words but not betraying my duty to help him with the things he can’t do, in this case, he can’t for the life of him figure out why CHASE has suddenly offered food. I KNOW your immediate assumption and I won’t respond to it/about it for obvious reason but don’t assume JY hasn’t himself posed the question. It’s not his concern at the moment.


Chase has implemented a rule that Johnny is only allowed one hour of downtime per day. The remaining hours must be “productive,” in his words. In the event that JY doesn’t have something PRODUCTIVE on schedule, he will no longer get a staff member that day. CHASE says this will offer LOYAL staff flexibility to do what they want with their schedule and work the hours they want.

What he didn’t say but I knew right away was that(with the Dual SLS/IHSS arrangement), if the staff member leaves, CHASE defaults to the on duty staff member and clocks in because someone must be there from 7-7 (he then clocks in from the 7pm-7am shift under IHSS)


Johnny receives disability income and cannot afford daily outings. He is physically limited, socially isolated, and lonely. One of his most consistent and emotionally supportive activities is gaming with someone. Because of his hands, he can’t always manage the controller — but with assistance on one or two buttons, he is able to enjoy some really bonkers games and feel have fun/blow off steam.
This week, Johnny specifically told that asking staff to play games with him(sometimes during moments of stress, sometimes just for fun). He described it as an activity that helps him calm down, stay grounded, and feel like someone is present with him.
Chase informed him that this is not an IHSS activity and that he “didn’t know” before.. He said that gaming with staff is not considered an activity under IHSS rules, and staff are not allowed to do it, even if Johnny directly asks.  And what really killed his spirit.
CHASE told him gaming would be limited to an hour per day.


At the same time, Chase says that since I am “marketing savvy”(im not) it could be part of my job to assist Johnny in creating a monetized tiktok channel, because that is considered “productive.” So helping Johnny game for stress relief is forbidden, but building him a content platform for profit is required. He’s gone so far as  buying JY an iPhone(a gift), ordering a special iPhone mount specially designed for streaming and ease of use.  He wants us to gather a “few months of footage” and then make a FUCNJKVB>DKNF YOUTUBE OR SOMETHING

IM SORRY im stressed out writing this


Johnny and I have always had regular, appropriate conversations about life, dating, coping, and stress — never clinical, never therapeutic. These are normal human conversations between a caregiver and an adult client who is cognitively unimpaired(im sorry if im using the wrong terminology im, autistic, not mean, I promise)

This week, Chase informed staff that we are no longer permitted to talk about feelings, stress, or personal emotions with Johnny. He said that Johnny is only to discuss those topics with his assigned therapist,  and that staff engaging in “emotional or deep” conversations is not allowed.

Often times when JY is upset we find ways to blow off steam, to analyze our feelings, find ways to discuss a lot of things. JY is an extremely empathetic and understanding person, I feel like I have learned to recognize and understand a lot of the way he handles emotions/upset and we reflect on these feelings in a really healthy way. My previous job was talking to young men who get absorbed into really angry/hateful rhetoric/groups, and helping them find healthier outlets and outlooks. I don’t give him clinical advice or ever act in any way as a healthcare professional, we just talk as 2 adults. This is now chase’s big NO NO.




JY and I spend about half of our day(12-14 hours)  bussing it to the gym, going to museums, comic shops, record stores. CHASE doesn’t disapprove of these activities, because they involve JY out of the house.


JY and I were recently designing a custom deck of cards together — a creative project we planned to give as a holiday gift to the  teams(staff/supportee)

Chase shut the project down. He told us staff should not be using their resources for creative projects with the people we support. He also said if Johnny wants to do art, it should be done with a friend, not with support staff.




Chase has explained his plan to get JY to socialize with a man in a chair down the road with similar life experiences. He owns a specialized kitchen with wheelchair access and CHASE has suggest we do cooking there. An idea I actually thought would be fun. It would be good for JY to try cooking with me for a meal sometime and meet a new friend. IF HE WANTS TO.
BUT CHASE has ulterior motives, he wants them to bond so JY will hire him on as part of his IHSS. This is not speculative, he told me his intention directly.



SOME EXTRA details, that we discussed after writing 

When Johnny first moved in, Chase was reported for an incident where he forced Johnny to spend close to an hour trying to pick up spilled groceries off the floor, even though it was clearly beyond his physical ability. Staff were told not to intervene.
This behavior is now reemerging in more structured and policyjustified ways. I was told this story by both JY (when we first met) and CHASE(this week when he confirmed it during his “Dear GPT” sessions)




CHASE has emailed JY the Lanterman Act, and showing it to staff on his phone when descrbing their new duties. telling staff that it is illegal to assist Johnny with anything he is physically capable of doing himself — even if it takes an hour. I’m not a lawyer. I am however concerned that he is misinterpreting it by asking GPT to apply it to his biased scenarios, and using it to justify abuse(intentionally or not)

Can I get clarification on the Lanterman Act?Chase says it means we are legally required to limit our help — and that IHSS prohibits us from doing more for someone than what they “can do.”
He’s using this to deny recreation, emotional support, and human contact.

JY wants this posted.
(There is a good chance by the time I write this, JY and I have both submitted several reports, he has asked to hold off so I will, as I am his employee, for now, until he’s ready or his safety is in question (I am with him 15-25 hours per week), as instructed by him.

Update 
I had to report. For his safety. 

Police showed up a few days ago. The SLS company me and CHAZE work for(owned by his family) as been asking JY to reveal who made the report. 


I am more than likely going to lose my job for this.

1m5jfms,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArlingtonMA/comments/1m5jfms/considering_a_move_from_bay_area_ca_to_arlington/,Considering a move from Bay Area CA to Arlington MA,"Hey everyone,

My wife and I are back on the house hunt after a recent visit to Newburyport, MA. While it's a beautiful town, we realized the community was a tad older than we expected, and we weren't quite ready for such an abrupt change from city life and its proximity.

Now, we're seriously considering **Arlington, MA**, due to its reputation for a vibrant local community and emphasis on family-focused activities. We both grew up in the South Shore but left for San Francisco about 10 years ago and truly fell in love with the local community feel there. We're in our mid-30s and recently started a family, so the draw to be closer to our greater Boston community, plus always loved our team in MA. 

We are particularly drawn to Arlington and are trying to prioritize:

* **Walkable downtown and strong local community:** We love the idea of being able to stroll to shops and eateries.
* **Good school system for our kid(s):** Elementary and daycare options are especially important to us.
* **Cost of living:** We're targeting homes in the $1.3-$1.5M range (which we know may be tight in some neighborhoods) 
* **Access to nature nearby:** Green spaces, parks, and trails are a huge plus.
* **Diversity:** We value a diverse and inclusive community.
* **Restaurant scene:** A good variety of dining options is important.
* **Proximity to other cool towns/cities:** We still want easy access to Boston and other interesting areas.

A few specific questions about Arlington:

1. **""Historical"" Properties & Permitting:** We're interested in a house right now that is deemed a ""historical"" property. For those who've gone through this, how difficult can the permitting process be in Arlington? Any tips or resources for navigating the Arlington Historical Commission or Historic Districts Commission? It appears as if it's largely exterior permitting and internal permitting wouldn't be \*too\* difficult, but i'm not sure. 
2. **Downtown Coffee Shops & Eateries:** We've noticed that Arlington Center, while charming, doesn't seem to have the same abundance of ""cute"" independent coffee shops or diverse eateries that we've come to appreciate in other areas (it feels a bit similar to Brighton in that regard). Is this a fair assessment, or are we missing some hidden gems? Is there a reason this type of establishment hasn't been prioritized more in the downtown area?
3. **Workout/Dance Studios:** My wife loves fitness communities, but we've observed that many studios seem to be more yoga or TRX focused. Are there any dance studios or other diverse workout communities she might be interested in, beyond those more common offerings?
4. **Community Vibe:** How is the community vibe realistically? Do folks welcome new faces and is it easy to integrate into local life with a young family?
5. **Schools & Daycares:** How are the Arlington schools realistically, especially elementary schools and daycares? Any specific insights on the different elementary zones?
6. **Bay Area Comparison:** If anyone has made the move from the Bay Area to Arlington, what do you miss most about the Bay Area, and what do you appreciate most about Arlington?

Any honest perspectives, insights, or advice on living in Arlington, especially for a family relocating from San Francisco, would be incredibly appreciated!

Hello! My wife and I are subletting our beloved apartment in the heart of the **Lower East Side** — just one block from the **Delancey/Essex FMJZ subway stop** — and we’re looking for someone to enjoy it while we temporarily relocate for work.

We’ve lived here together for 4 years (and I’ve called this home for over 9!). It’s truly a gem: full of character, flooded with light, and perfectly located to take advantage of everything downtown Manhattan has to offer. We’re only moving because my wife, a special education teacher, accepted a position in Connecticut for the upcoming school year.

We have a great relationship with our long-term landlord and are looking for responsible tenants to sublet while we’re away. Here’s what makes the apartment special:

* **2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom** in a classic **pre-war walk-up** (2nd floor – just one straight flight up!)
* **King-size primary bedroom** fits a king bed, dresser, two nightstands, desk, and an armchair — plus a large closet with overhead storage
* **Second bedroom** fits a queen bed and dresser, has a deep closet — could also be used as a **home office or guest room**
* **Spacious living/dining room** fits a 6-person dining table, sectional sofa, armchairs, coffee table, and TV console
* **Updated kitchen** with tons of cabinetry, a dedicated pantry, and newer appliances (all replaced within the last 4 years)
* **High ceilings** and **southeast-facing windows** that flood the apartment with natural light
* **Window planters** outside the living room — perfect for growing herbs or seasonal flowers!
* Only **1 block from the Delancey/ Essex FMJZ** subway stop, and right in the middle of the best restaurants, bars, shopping, and entertainment the city has to offer
* Within **5-10 minute walking distance** of **Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Essex Market, and Union Market**
* **Laundromat** right across the street
* Will be **unfurnished**
* **No pets**

Please DM me if interested and we can set up a video chat.

*UEFA Champions League Qualification, July 22, 2025*

**Odds Breakdown: The Math of a One-Sided Affair**  
Let’s start with the numbers because even FC Drita’s fans probably know this isn’t their night. FC Copenhagen is priced at **1.11** (implied probability: **90%**) to win, while Drita’s chances hover around **4.17%** (odds: +2300). The draw sits at **9.5-11.0** (9-10% implied), which is about the same chance as your Uncle Steve scoring a penalty kick blindfolded. The goal totals? A **3.5 Under** is favored at **1.74-1.85** (55-57% implied), suggesting this could be a defensive snoozefest—or a Copenhagen shutout, which would make Drita’s attack look less offensive.

**Team News: Why Drita’s “Underdog” Label Is a Joke**  
Copenhagen just pulled off a **3-2 comeback against Viborg**, proving they’re the soccer equivalent of a Roomba: relentless, slightly chaotic, but always eventually getting the job done. Drita, meanwhile, advanced with a **3-2 win over Differdange**, which is impressive… if your idea of a thriller is a kindergarten class playing with mismatched LEGO blocks. The Kosovan side is a talented underdog, sure, but they’re facing a Danish team that’s **23:1 favorites**. To put that in perspective, Drita’s chances of winning are about the same as me correctly guessing your favorite pizza topping blindfolded.

**Humor Injection: The Absurdity of This Matchup**

1m5jb46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1m5jb46/explore_the_brita_ob03_review_should_you_choose/,Explore the Brita OB03 Review Should You Choose This Water Filter Solution?,"The **Brita OB03 Standard Water Filter for Pitchers and Dispensers** has quickly earned a prominent spot in my kitchen routine. From its promise to reduce harmful impurities to its no-fuss installation, this water filter ticks quite a few boxes. I’ve used it daily for weeks now, and I’ve got quite a few thoughts to share. Whether it excels in performance or leaves room for improvement is what you’re about to find out. 

**Design and Compatibility**  
What struck me first was the simplicity of its design. These filters come with a compact and lightweight build—just 400 grams—making them easy to handle and install. No fussing over instructions; they snap right into compatible Brita water pitchers and dispensers. I tested it out with the Brita Grand Water Pitcher and the Slim Water Filter Pitcher, and the seamless fit was impressive, working exactly as advertised. The universal fitting is a huge plus since it reduces the headache of determining compatibility.

**Ease of Use**  
The setup process is as straightforward as it gets. There's no need to pre-soak the filter, which is fantastic because, frankly, who has time for that? Once installed, you’re good to go. The mesh screens do a great job of preventing those pesky black flecks that were a problem with some earlier filters. I noticed the time-saving aspect right away, especially on busy weekday mornings when precision and speed matter.

**Performance and Filtration Quality**  
The performance of these filters is where they shine. They efficiently tackled the chlorine aftertaste in my tap water, which always used to bother me. Beyond that, they reduce heavy metals like copper, cadmium, and mercury. These are things you don’t think about until you realize how much fresher and cleaner your water can be. It’s incredible how even the subtle flavor notes of the water improved—ideal for coffee brewing or cooking. Based on my taste perception, it delivers on its promise of healthier, better-tasting water.

**Sustainability Angle**  
Switching to these filters made me feel a bit better about my environmental footprint. Each filter replaces up to 300 single-use plastic water bottles. Over a year, that’s potentially 1,800 bottles less going to a landfill. From a sustainable living perspective, this is a no-brainer. It’s also worth mentioning that they are recyclable through the Gimme 5 Program, which makes it easier for eco-conscious users to dispose of them responsibly.

**Pluses**
- Compatible with multiple Brita pitchers and dispensers.
- Reduces chlorine taste and heavy metal impurities effectively.
- Quick installation with no priming required.
- Supports sustainable practices by reducing plastic waste.

**Flaws**  
Of course, no product is without its quirks, and these filters are no exception.  
- They’re not compatible with Brita Stream systems.
- While the chlorine reduction is notable, it does not address microbiologically unsafe water, so keep that in mind.  
- The two-month lifespan per filter is decent, though it could feel short for larger households with high water consumption.

**Alternative Products**  
When comparing this water filter to contenders such as the PUR Lead Reducing Water Filters, the differences are clear. PUR also tackles heavy metals but struggles with the long-term cost of replacement filters, which run higher than Brita's. ZeroWater and its five-stage filter system offer the added benefit of removing fluoride, but their filters don’t last as long, making Brita a more economical option for everyday use. The choice boils down to budget and primary concerns about water quality, though I find Brita to strike an optimal balance of price and performance.

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering all the features and benefits on offer, this filter provides excellent value for its price range. You’re not just paying for cleaner water but also long-term savings on bottled water and an effortless setup process. Even though replacements are inevitable, the volume coverage of 40 gallons (or about two months) helps stretch your dollar. Features like no pre-soaking and reliable mineral reduction sweeten the deal even more.

1m5j9y5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m5j9y5/should_you_try_the_oxo_brew_single_serve_coffee/,Should You Try the OXO Brew Single Serve Coffee Maker Review?,"Testing the OXO 11180100 Brew Single Serve Pour-Over Coffee Maker, I must say, it's been quite an interesting experience, blending simplicity with reliable functionality. It's not some high-tech machine packed with endless features, but that's precisely where its charm lies. This coffee maker is laser-focused on delivering a flavor-rich, pour-over coffee experience without complicating your morning caffeine routine. Having used it daily for a couple of weeks, I found it caters to minimalists and coffee purists alike.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact and clean design of this pour-over coffee maker caught my eye immediately. With its stark white color and petite 5.25” x 5.25” dimensions, it fits snugly onto my increasingly crowded kitchen counter. At under 8 ounces, it's impressively lightweight, which makes it ideal for travel or even throwing in the bag for an outdoor adventure. The dishwasher-safe feature is a blessing, particularly for those lazy post-coffee cleanup sessions. While it feels sturdy with high-quality, durable plastic, it doesn’t scream ""luxury product."" Still, it’s function-over-form approach absolutely works here. Ensuring it doesn't stand out as an eyesore in any kitchen setup is another mini win.  

**Ease of Use**  
Using the coffee maker every morning has been refreshingly hassle-free. Everything from the reusable filter setup to the water tank with measurement markings ensures a smooth, user-friendly routine. The operation is as “manual” as you’d expect from a pour-over coffee maker, which I personally appreciate—it lets you stay in control of the brewing process. Whether it's at home, at work, or while traveling, the straightforward design adapts well to various scenarios. If you’re someone who prizes simplicity and hates fiddling with overly complex coffee makers, this one's a winner.  

[Time for OXO 11180100? Check price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01enk41q6/)  

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
The promise of a consistent, flavorful cup of coffee every day isn’t mere lip service. Thanks to the auto-drip water tank, which controls the flow for even extraction, every cup has been reliably smooth and well-balanced. The water tank markings make it easy to measure for consistency, and the precise pattern of holes ensures even distribution. I’ve tinkered around with different coffee grinds and amounts, but it’s quick to find your sweet spot. However, if you’re hoping for a fast brewing process, this may not be the product for you. You’ll need to spare a few minutes to allow for the coffee to brew properly, but if patience isn’t an issue, the resulting rich aroma more than compensates.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact, lightweight, and travel-friendly design  
- Dishwasher-safe construction simplifies cleanup  
- Auto-drip feature ensures balanced brewing  
- No electricity needed, making it cost-effective and versatile  
- Lid doubles as a drip tray, keeping spills under control  

**Shortcomings**  
While overall excellent, there are a few areas that could use improvement:  
- The design is allergy-averse to tech lovers—no built-in timers or alerts  
- Brewing does take a little longer compared to drip coffee machines  
- Limited 12-ounce capacity isn’t ideal for making multiple cups at once  
- Not suitable for individuals who prefer more automated coffee-making systems  

**Competing Products**  
Pitting this against other pour-over coffee makers like the Kalita Wave or Hario V60 was inevitable. The Kalita Wave, for instance, boasts a stainless steel build with a design geared for advanced brewers, but it misses the convenience factor of OXO’s auto-drip tank. As for the Hario V60, it promises the ultimate control over pour-over variables but may not suit beginners due to its steeper learning curve. Where the OXO coffee maker outshines its competitors is ease of use—it’s a middle-ground choice, perfect for those who seek simplicity yet refuse to compromise on flavor profile. However, the Hario V60 offers a sturdier and more aesthetic design, making it a tempting alternative.

**Quality for Price**  
Given the focus this product lays on essentials, it provides exceptional value for money. Though not packed with bells and whistles, it doesn't lack where it matters—making it a reliable investment. Affordable without feeling cheap, and effective at brewing rich coffee, it feels like money well spent. If you’re on a budget, the reusable filter, no-electricity operation, and straightforward design make it an ideal choice. Whether you view it as an everyday brewer or a backup for travel or camping, its price-to-quality ratio works in its favor.

1m5j7xh,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1m5j7xh/does_the_kitchenaid_kad1rxd1_refrigerator_water/,Does the KitchenAid KAD1RXD1 Refrigerator Water Filter Truly Deliver? Full Review,"Having used the KitchenAid KAD1RXD1 Refrigerator Water Filter on a daily basis for several months now, I feel well-equipped to dive deeply into the ins and outs of this product. This device claims to provide cleaner water for drinking and ice-making in KitchenAid refrigerators, and I have to say, it's been a fascinating experience testing it ourselves. While I enjoyed the positives this water filter brings to the table, a few areas left me scratching my head.

**Design and Build Quality**

The compact and straightforward design of this refrigerator water filter immediately caught my attention. It measures a tidy 2.5""D x 2.5""W x 8.75""H and weighs just over 7 ounces, making installation a breeze. I managed to replace it within minutes, and it fit seamlessly into my unit—no need to consult a degree-level manual! The robust plastic material gives it a sturdy feel, and it's clear KitchenAid aimed for both functionality and durability. While there's nothing about its visual appeal that's groundbreaking (after all, it's a water filter), the simplicity of the design ensures it does its job without hassle.

**Ease of Installation**

Swapping out my old water filter with the KAD1RXD1 was surprisingly simple, which was a major win for me since I tend to struggle with complicated installations. It's compatible with most KitchenAid refrigerators, but I’d recommend confirming compatibility with your previous filter model. The instructions were clear and concise, so even if you're a first-timer, there’s nothing to fear about this process. 

[Find the best price for KitchenAid KAD1RXD1 on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0c445pwvq/)

**Certifications and Contaminant Reduction**

What really impressed me about this water filter was its NSF certification, which ensures it reduces 28 contaminants, including some of the nastiest stuff like lead, pesticides, and even pharmaceuticals. As someone who is particular about water quality, this gave me peace of mind. I tested it with a water meter, and the results seemed to back up its claim—the taste of the water was noticeably fresher, and my family could even tell the difference when making coffee or tea. That said, some reviews I’ve come across mention slight issues with flow rate, though I personally didn’t notice much of an impact in my own refrigerator setup.

**Merits**

- **Significant Health Perks:** Reduces 28 contaminants for better-tasting and safer water.  
- **Eco-Friendly Advantage:** Replaces up to 1500 plastic water bottles annually.  
- **User-Friendly Replacement Process:** Clear-cut installation even for beginners.  

**Pitfalls**

- **Inconsistent Experiences with Flow Rate:** Some users report reduced water flow.  
- **Compatibility Concerns:** Double-checking your refrigerator’s model is a must.  

**Daily Performance and Longevity**

Throughout my testing, I used the filter both for drinking water and ice-making, and it performed reliably. Over the recommended lifespan of 6 months, I didn’t notice any degradation in water quality, which is reassuring. Being able to replace one filter rather than a truckload of bottled water makes this both a practical and environmentally-friendly choice. However, there were brief moments where my ice cubes seemed to have a slightly slower production time, something I wonder if frequent users might also notice.

**Competitors and Rival Products**

After testing this filter, I took some time to compare it to similar products like the EveryDrop EDR1RXD1 and AQUA CREST water filters. While the EveryDrop is also NSF-certified and offers solid contaminant reduction, I found it slightly harder to install. AQUA CREST, on the other hand, is highly affordable but lacks the NSF certification, which for me was a deal-breaker. If you prioritize ease of installation and verified contaminant reduction, the KitchenAid filter holds an edge in these respects. On the flip side, certain alternatives might offer a higher flow rate.

**Bang for the Buck**

This water filter doesn’t come cheap, but its features—like the ability to filter out complex contaminants and reduce single-use plastics—certainly contribute to its value. While you might find lower-priced options, they often compromise on certifications or longevity. For anyone serious about water quality and reducing their environmental footprint, the extra cost feels justified. I also like that I didn’t need to change it before the 6-month mark, saving some pennies over time.

* Open shelving is the enemy. Open shelving is strictly for display purposes only. If you do decide to use open shelving for storage, do yourself a favor and use containers, like bins, boxes, crates, or even pouches. 
* if you want your containers to look nice, get them all in similar material, dimensions and colors. Even a bunch of cardboard boxes can look nice if they are the same shape and size. 
* 90% of the posts I see asking for help come down to this: declutter. Too hard to organize your closet? Get rid of stuff. Much easier to manage what you actually use. 
* imo , ADHD people have to work really hard to find their systems that work for them, so look for adhd-friendly organization hacks. I don't love having a bowl by the front door, but my girlfriend does. I love hooks though!
* the necessary evil twin of organization is a junk drawer. I have a (nice) cardboard box in my office that i just throw stuff in until it gets full.  then I review it, and more than likely just donate it but somethings I put back. 
* be bitter: Once something betrays me, I never give it another chance. I tossed a pair of shorts because my wallet fell out of the pocket TWICE in one day. I got rid of a coffee mug set because it was too difficult to handwash. 

I'm very particular when it comes to my space, Marie Kondo was right when she says our objects must spark joy. Each of our things must serve us and be easy to access. Your home is not a storage unit, it's a place for you to live.",2,1753105241.0,organizing,0,1.0,False

Dear \[Agent\],

I’m excited to share with you my novel, *Cafe*, an upmarket fiction with fabulist and elements to explore, complete at 98,000 words.

Following a traumatic divorce, Fred *Something* continually avoids his shadow—a subconscious voice. Like any troubled soul, he’ll do anything to cover up his inner silence: music, video games, doom scrolling, drinking, even extended conversations with his speaking dog. 

While distracting himself with a coffee in an East Village cafe, Fred meets a nameless man who, as it turns out, knows how to see and manipulate the shapes of shadows. Seeing Fred’s mangled shape, he takes advantage, as he is actually a prisoner to a metaphysical reality unable to exist in the physical world beyond the cafe—the gateway. With great charisma, he tricks ignorant Fred into a bargain that not only replaces Fred’s shadow, but pushes him out of his body entirely as a means to exist past the door of the cafe.

As Fred begins experiencing the hallucinatory side effects of the escaped prisoner, he is pursued by several accomplices of the cafe attempting to restore the balance he has broken before the cafe’s owner becomes involved—once the Owner is involved it isn’t good for anybody. He soon meets Angelica, a prisoner to the physical world herself, playing the part as just another girl in the city. Angelica could risk condemning herself further into her own prison, but is determined to sever Fred’s link to the nameless man. As Fred is lured by Angelica’s mysterious nature, she continually deters his parasite through ethereal acts that seem like nothing but modern debauchery: burning cigarettes in his palm, serving him psychedelic lasagna, loading him up with pickle shots. After a long night out with friends, Angelica decides to make her sacrifice, and Fred finally chooses to trust her methods, severing his connection through an intimate climax. While maybe leaving Fred on a power trip, he ends up with more problems than before.

With the nameless man left without substance in the physical world the cafe remains in conflict, and the Owner is seeking someone to replace his lost prisoner, preferably the man who set him free in the first place. Fred must decide if he can continue to ignore the broken balance of not just the cafe, but his own life, as his troubled past and present dilemmas overlap in a mind bending spiral.

*Cafe* is a meditation on the subconscious, the hidden realities that underlie the everyday, and the modern struggle of identity. It has the high concept, unraveling plot of Gareth Brown’s *The Book of Doors*, while told through the literary fabulism and speculative atmosphere of Helen Oyeyemi's *The Parasol and the Axe.*



I am a first time author who works as an IT Administrator by day, and, like Fred Something, continually works on my own relationship with my shadow.

After the fiasco of Ken Dowling’s committee meeting, many of us received job changes. Of course, this was no surprise we knew how the system worked. Some of us were moved out of the laundry and some even out of the Bethel home and to the factory. I guess they wanted to bust up the troublemakers. It was time for the *shaft!*

In the early 1970's they were in short supply of volunteers/workers. So, they didn't ask us to leave. They couldn't afford to lose a hundred and fifty of us, that would have been almost 10% of their workforce.

No they had a better idea, they would just use us up.

In 1860, the average price for a slave was around $800, but the price varied significantly based on factors like age, sex, skill, and health. 

So of course they weren't going to get rid us. Where else can you find people willing to be treated like an indentured servant and be willing to work for only $22 a month!

At the time, they were asking for volunteers for a night shift in the factory. They didn’t usually send us *home boys* to the factory, but they sent many of us. Most of the guys who worked in the Bethel home wanted to stay there. They loved to be able to sit around the dining room table and have that extra cup of coffee before they had to be back at work.

How could we be *shafted* anymore then the worst job you could have in the Bethel Home, the laundry? We heard stories about the factory. As it would turn out, we had no idea what was waiting for us over there, at the factory complex.

If the laundry was the penal institution of the home, then the bindery was the penal institution of the factory and in fact the entire Bethel complex. The difference was the bindery made the laundry look like heaven.

I was sent to work on the night shift in the sewing department. *The Smythe sewing machines* was a machine that was designed by the devil himself. You would sit on this chair and throw thousands and thousands of paper sheets called signatures over a saddle where they would be sewn together. They would later become books when the bindery lines got through with them.

The good thing about working on these machines is you could always stop them.

On the other hand, on the bindery lines, there was no stopping the machines. You were like *Charlton Heston*, the galley slave in the movie *Ben Hur*. Everyone rowed together and no one stopped. If one person stopped, the whole line could go down. It was just like the movie except there were no drums beating to keep pace and it was always ramming speed.

The night shift in the sewing department was rock bottom for me in the winter of 1971-72. I tried to sleep during the days and dragged myself to work at nights. I was in a fog most of the time.

After many months on the night shift in the sewing department, it was time for my permanent job change. I was sent to the bindery on the 5th floor, building 3, bindery line 5.

Welcome to Hell. *Abandon all hope, who enter here*. They didn’t put the sign above the door like Auschwitz’s slogan “work sets you free,” but they might as well have.

You became a machine. You had to stand in this small spot, one foot square that was between two different machines. Your job was to take a book out of one machine, called *the rounder* and turn it upside down and shove it into another machine called *the back liner.*

In the eight-plus-hours shift, you stood there in the same spot all day doing this same repetitive motion between 15,000 to 17,000 times a day.

There were days in that factory that felt like an eternity. You would look up at the clock and it said 2:13, then a lifetime would pass, and you would look back at the clock again and it said 2:28.

You tried to keep your mind active by thinking about different things, as your hands did the same repetitive motion. Your first week, you thought about all of the important events in your life. The next week, you would think about places you wanted to visit. The next week, you would think about all the movies you ever saw. The next week, you thought about girls. Well maybe, I thought the girls for two weeks The next week, you thought about all the mistakes you ever made. The next week…

After a few months, you would have a strange, blank look on your face. Someone would walk up to you and ask what you were thinking about. “Nothing,” you’d say as you stared off into the distance, because you were brain dead. The lights were on but nobody was home.

If you begged your line overseer, he might give you a five minute break to go to the bathroom every four hours. That meant he would have to take over your position. Since he didn’t want to be standing there between those two mind numbing machines either, you needed to get back to your spot as soon as possible. There was no time to even shake it twice. Of course, they could have bought a machine that did the same job for about $5,000, but it only cost them $22 a month for a warm body like me to do the same job.

If it wasn’t for Knorr’s white China habit, perhaps the money saved from unbroken dishes and reformed bath soap could have paid for at least one of those machines.

One time, an Army general came through on a tour of the factory. He shook his head in astonishment when he saw the people on the machines. The tour guide said, “I’m sure you could get your troops to do the same thing.”

The general replied, “Are you kidding? No way!”

Only the insane or religious zealots need to apply. I guess I/we were both. I was determined to take anything they could throw at me.

Yes I still believed and I thought that even though the very top of the organization and it's leaders was corrupt....that somehow god was still running the whole show.

However it would take me another 27 years of me bull shitting myself to find out that wasn't the case....god or his son wasn't anywhere near the place! 

My friend Jim Pipkorn, who was *shafted* out of the laundry also ended up in the factory. He got *shafted* to the bindery also. He was on the *end sheet gluer machine,* in the bindery. He became so depressed that for months he would come back to his room at night and make himself some dinner and then just go to bed at about 7:00 p.m.

I asked him why he was doing that. He said, “It makes the days go by quicker.”

Yes, we were counting our time in Hell. It was just like Vietnam. After just a few months there even the *new boys* were counting the days. You would ask a new boy how long he had left. If he said something like, “Three years and two months to go,” we would reply, “You poor bastard. That is after 1975.” You should have seen the look on his face.

Of course, there was no racial prejudice in *the Lord’s house.* Even though Pastor Russel wrote about the inferiority of African Americans in many of his publications.

About 10 percent of all Bethelites were black. However, about 60 percent of the guys working in the bindery were black. It seemed odd to me how disproportionate the numbers were.

I couldn’t help but ask Calvin Chyke about this one day as we were walking to the factory together. He was in charge of factory personnel at the time. He told me, “The black Brothers had a natural rhythm that fit in well with the machines.”

I guess this was one time when natural rhythm wasn’t an advantage.

Ronnie Klineman from Ruston, Louisiana, told me my favorite story about Brother Lyman Swingle (who was from Alabama) and who was on the *Governing Body* at the time. Ronnie sat at Lyman’s table. There happened to be a new black kid from Detroit assigned to Brother Swingle’s table. Of course, as a new boy, he was feeling pretty good about himself as most new boys do when they first arrive.

Lyman glanced over at him at lunch one day. “Boy, would you please pass me the potatoes.” The black Brother looked at Lyman with disdain and fired back. “I’m not your boy!”

To which Lyman said, not even batting an eye said. “Ni...er, pass the potatoes.”

This really happened. Hard to believe, isn’t it? Yes, Bethel was not the place to try and be uppity. Black or white, we were all just boys in their eyes and, of course, they could say and do anything they wanted to us. Was this kid going to go and complain about something a member of *The Governing Body* said? I think not.

This was the early 1970s and the Black Power movement was just starting to happen. Some of the black Brothers at Bethel had a little bit of an attitude before they got there. If they didn’t, many picked it up after a few months in the house of god. I can’t say I blame them. They could see how even though they talked about equality among the brothers it was a white man’s organization with very few black overseers.

There are many terms used in this book that might sound foreign to those not familiar with the Jehovah Witnesses. There are many words or terms used at Bethel that are unique to just their organization. Here are some:

*The Family or Bethel Family* – These are Jehovah’s Witnesses who are called Bethelites, the workers at the world headquarters and branch offices around the world.

*A Jack* – Someone who is a slacker or just lazy.

*A pot licker* – This term has been used for many years but its connotation is unclear. It is basically used in the same way as *A Jack.*

*New Boy* – Someone who just got to Bethel and doesn’t know the ropes.

*A Golden Boy* – Someone who has a great job that isn’t on a production line. He is assigned to a great Kingdom Hall that has few Bethelites in it and is just a short distance from Bethel. He never gets into any trouble. If he does something wrong, someone else is usually blamed. *A Golden Boy* is a very rare occurrence at Bethel but they do exist.

*G Job* – Work done outside of Bethel for monetary gain.

*Gleaning* – Many of the Sisters use this term to refer to the gathering of leftover food from the dining room after the breakfast or noon meal is over. There was nothing worth taking after the supper meal.

*Hopper Shoppe*r – People who get most of their garments out of the clothes hoppers that hold all the donated and second-hand clothing.

*Mugger Money* – Cash you keep somewhere on your person in case you are ever mugged. The reason for this money is to prevent you from being beaten. The mugger or assailants have gone through a lot of trouble to rob you. You will really piss them off if you don’t have anything to give them. They will be convinced you are holding out on them and they will proceed to beat the shit out of you. Because who really walks around New York City with no money besides a Bethelite?

*Burn Out or Tour Speed* – Work that is done at a much faster pace than normal. Many times, this activity was incorporated when people visiting Bethel were coming through on a tour. We would work extra fast to impress them.

*Short Timer* – Someone who left Bethel early, before his or her tour of duty was up.

*Morning Worship* – This is the morning activity (except on Sunday) of discussing the Daily Text. The Bethel family would listen and watch five to six Brothers or Sisters on television give their comments about a scripture that was picked out of the *Year Book* for that day.

*S R or a Ricky Righteou*s – Someone who is self-righteous or a super zealot. Many *new boys* are afflicted with this attitude. This person thinks of himself or herself as the right hand of god. They might feel it’s their right and duty to impose their perceived concepts of god’s will onto other people.

*A Privilege of Service –* This is how Bethel Elders will describe any job assigned to you, no matter how lowly or demeaning it might seem. It is your privilege and honor to work on this job assignment, however, there is a catch. This same job or *privilege of service* could be considered to be a punishment. This is the case if they reassign you to a shitty job because of some minor infraction. Then your new *privilege of service* has turned into what is commonly known at Bethel as *the shaft*.

*The Shaft* – This is what you got when you are reassigned to a job that isn’t as prestigious as your previous one. (this is what happened to all us *brothers* after Ken's committee meeting) Not only is it not prestigious, it could be so physically demanding that you think you are going to die. You are obviously not moving up the company ladder. You are now going in the opposite direction. *The shaft* could be applied when the powers that be want you to leave Bethel. However, instead of asking you to leave, they figure they can take advantage of you for a while before you break down or just give up and in a few cases even kill yourself. These same overseers will tell you there is no such thing as *the shaft* at Bethel. This obviously is not true. Just ask Fred Barnes or hundreds of other Brothers who have experienced *the shaft* at Bethel first hand. Since Bethel is just like any other organization that is run by politics and favoritism, *the shaft* is used liberally and is inserted when you are bending over.

*Service Talk* – Usually given to you by an overseer or Bethel Elder. However, any fellow Brother at Bethel could give you this talk if he is an *“S R.”* This talk is usually conducted in a back room somewhere and is administered if it seems you have stepped out of line or somehow broken one of many written or unwritten laws at Bethel. These talks are usually not done for serious offenses. That would require a *judicial committee.* Even if you did nothing wrong, don’t try and defend yourself. The person giving you the *service talk* doesn’t want his mind confused by any facts. “The old Indian Navajo” trick (explained later) is best applied here. Sometimes you might receive a job change after your *service talk* to teach you a lesson. The job change would then be considered *the shaft.*

*Bad Attitude or B A* – This is someone who is on the opposite end of being an *“S R”* or a *Ricky Righteous.* This person has some doubts about Bethel and the Bethel system. He may have seen or experienced some unchristian behavior by the powers-that-be. Or maybe someone who didn’t like him has given him *the shaft.* He may decide to verbalize these disappointments or thoughts to others. If this attitude is noted, he may receive a *service talk.*

*G B or Governing Body* – These are the supreme leaders of the organization, usually ten to fifteen members. They are the leaders who control *the heavies,* and the *company men,* the Bethel family and the rest of the world of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Their numbers vary a lot because they are older men who keep dying off. There are currently eight members.

*A Bethel Heavy* – One of the four to five dozen people who are either running Bethel or are in a position of prominence.

*Company Man* – Someone who is staying past his commitment and loves Bethel and wants to make Bethel his career. They are the new future leaders of the organization. There are a few of these guys who are humble but most of them are *S R.* Of course, the goal here is to be a *Bethel heavy* one day.

*Having someone for breakfast* – This is done when someone leaves Bethel in disgrace, or has been kicked out for a serious transgression. *The Governing Body* will inform the Bethel family of this person’s sins and sometimes describe these sins in graphic detail after *the Daily Text* and before breakfast starts. The only time they didn’t do this was when a pedophile and *Governing Body member* was asked to leave Bethel. That story and coverup is in chapter 24.

*Family Night* – When the Bethel Family would volunteer or take turns getting up on a stage. They can perform skits, sing or tell jokes. Of course, this is highly regulated. They didn’t have this when I was at Bethel.

These are important terms people should know when they first arrive at Bethel. Sadly, most people find out about these terms the hard way. Maybe they should have a complete disclosure for the new boys about these important items in their *Dwelling Together in Unity* booklet.

However, complete disclosure really isn’t their style.... is it?

My 14 month old whines and screams so, so much. She is a very happy girl, and well cared for, we play with her a lot, I give her a lot of attention and she also goes to daycare, BUT she still whines and screams so much. It starts in the morning after she gets up, when I change her diaper and/or put her on the floor. She doesn't want t be on my lap, she does not want to be on the floor. If I get up to go to the bathroom she will start screaming immediately and run after me. If I bring her to the kitchen with me she wants to be held, and hell breaks loose if I dare to put her on the floor. Sometimes she will scream for 30min after a nap. If I don't engage with her constantly she will whine and have a meltdown (sometimes even while I engage with her). If I try to drink a cup of coffee she will try to rip it out of my hand, and since I don't let her - meltdown and more whining.

I'm so tired of it, I wish I could spend a morning or afternoon without constant whining, yelling and meltdowns. Shes only truly happy when we're at the playground or play ball outside, which - trust me - we do ALL the time. I'm honestly scared to spend any time at home with her because of how she acts at home. 

So yea, I know this is probably the reality for many parents of toddlers, but when does this actually end or get better? Please tell me it's soon, lol. Thanks",1,1753104831.0,toddlers,2,1.0,False

Most people miss this.

They see the Coke. Not the trucks.



Coca-Cola’s empire isn’t built on soda.

It’s built on logistics — one of the largest private fleets in the world.

The trucks are the asset.



**Assets give leverage.**



Coca-Cola skips the middleman.

Uses trucks as collateral.

Depreciates them to reduce taxes.

The soda is just cargo.

The wealth is in the fleet.



This is a blueprint:



* McDonald’s sells burgers. The wealth is in the land.
* Tesla sells cars. The leverage is in the batteries.
* Starbucks sells coffee. The moat is in the farms.





**They all own the means of production.**



Apply this to your life:



* Don’t rent solutions to repeat problems.
* Every recurring payment is a leak.





Examples:



* 💧 Bottled water → Water filter
* 🏋️ Gym membership → Dumbbells
* 🥩 Daily groceries → Freezer + bulk





Own the system. Build leverage.

For example I need to buy a new coffee maker. I tell my man that our coffee maker does not make hot enough coffee anymore and I plan to buy a new one. At first he seems to be either indifferent or on board with it, but then the questions start. They are designed to make me question my decision. ""But do we have the money?"" ""Yeah that one has so many plastic pieces that would not be good"" ""you sure that's the one you want?"" ""But this month our budget is bad, you should wait for black Friday"" question or comment after another. Then lastly he says well you do you - go ahead if that feels right. 

But of course after that it won't feel right. I feel like I am spending our money on something that is not totally necessary, I can't really buy the right one, what if there will be better one soon, maybe my dream coffee maker will be on sale next month. And then I end up not making the purchase. 

If I talk about it with him, he gets defensive and ignores all the talk me downs, only focusing on the last comments - the you do you part. In his opinion he is not controlling me and making me change my view. He says I should not let him affect me, and just do whatever no matter what he says. 

Today we were eating outside and it was time for our baby's nap. We went by car and took strollers with us. I told him that I planned to walk baby home with a stroller, giving him time to sleep the same time. Husband could go ahead and drive home. 

Then the comments started ""well it is way too sunny, if only we had some sunscreen on"" ""well have fun with red burnt skin"" ""ok but the car is right there, we could go home and then you can go for a walk"" then after we are at the car, he says well walk if u want. Those comments again does affect me and I choose not to. 

The car ride home was full of screaming and crying, baby was overtired and won't sleep in the car. I said that it was a mistake not walking home, I wish you would not have talked me out of it. And he says that well I told you to do it, ignoring all the other comments he said. And that I am a grown woman, I should not listen to anything anyone else says and just keep my head, no matter how much anyone tries to sway my decisions. 

At the same time yes, I am a grown woman with the ability to make decisions. Should I just not let anyone else affect me? Am I the asshole for giving in and hearing my husband when he questions my thoughts? I still feel annoyed and deflected if I don't have support at home, if I am constantly questioned and talked out of stuff. 

I feel like we are partners, our opinions should matter so of course if he does not like what I plan to do it does affect it. But he thinks I should just hold my ground. AITA for letting his opinions affect me? ",1,1753104761.0,AmItheAsshole,6,1.0,False

Remove the crumble from the fridge/freezer and break in about half of it on top of the cake.
Pour the other half of the batter on top of this.
Add on top of the rest of the crumble. It is going to feel like a lot, but it is needed for this cake.
Bake for 45 minutes until a toothpick comes out almost clean.
Remove from the oven, wait until it has cooled before cutting into it. Enjoy!",2,1753104672.0,glutenfreerecipes,1,1.0,False

From my own experience swimming in deep waters: 

There is the potential to become overwhelmed in pessimism and nihilism and disorder diagnoses from discovering the truth. I can deny it, but I can't avoid it.

so, how do I deal with the fallout of this hopelessness if I'm unwilling to deny it .. ""That's life, right?"" Maybe, but no, it doesn't have to be. I didn't take it at face value and I had to get creative and figure out how I could change this instead of being destroyed by.

why does it feel like war every time I look for answers.. where is the hope? everything tells me how to deny, suppress, dismiss and stay in it but I want to get out of it!
----
along my journey I learned to set my mind to disengage and observe everything without judging it.

I learned I can't change, correct or save/repair anything or anyone. because of this I was able to learn what I was here to do, find purpose, mind you this took years to discover, it's not an overnight thing.

until I mastered  (in my own way) how to observe and be silent, I lost a lot of battles and became exhausted and hopeless. I turned the despair of those losses around one day. 

I saw what needing to be a good person was doing to me and everyone in this world. in order to win I need to learn how to become a thief, and a warrior, a liar and a cheater. I'm not going to lie and cheat and steal from people, no, I'm going to do all of these things to my opposition, but I have to know what I'm dealing with and I can't be a good person to do this. none of this is about being a good person, I discovered for myself. That's why people who wound and destroy tell you to lead with love (not yourself). if you believe you have to lead with anything other than yourself, you have are exposed and all I got were wounds, instead of learning lessons and becoming stronger.

I couldn't go through this life not knowing what wounded me so here's how wounds operate to help or consume us..

******there are two types of wounds:*******
one Wound is from a friend, and the other Wound is the collective pessimism and categorizing of our age.

the pessimism it is the collective thoughts of everyone's septic state of mind. every time someone has a ""bad"" thought or a ""bad"" feeling, they say I'm a good person, I can't think that way, or I have to feel good, not bad.. instead of dealing with that wound (that was created by them), they rip it out and throw it away, but it doesn't disappear it has to go somewhere. 

8 billion people are ripping wounds out of themselves and ""throwing it away"" 10x a day or more in order to feel better- 

it's a tragedy because we don't understand that that is what we're doing, but most people do not care at all. now all of these wounds have collected together and it influences the world through the feelings we go around feeling that makes us hopeless for some reason, or for no reason at all.

The first wound that threw me into existential crisis after existential crisis/the one that makes me uncomfortable with staying put, is my friend. some people called this wound the dark night of the soul. 

The other wound is a collective form of 8 billion people, which is why it feels crushing. i'm desperate to find answers and it leverages my desperation to bury me in pessimism and hopelessness in order to stagnate and decay.

I came to understand this to help me stay balanced in existential crisis:

my friend wound is there to push me out of harms way and back out to the deep, where it is safe. it seems like it's trying to kill me but it's doing it for me because - it is me...

when I stop labeling the world as bad evil and dangerous, my friend wound becomes just my friend. I understand that there isn't anything evil, that there isn't anything bad, that there isn't anything dangerous, so I 
Get rid of that injured thinking, I get rid of all the rules, I get rid of being obedient to everything I've been taught and I wipe the slight clean and began listening to myself. I destroy everything and I begin to rebuild on my terms. 

I allow my conscious awareness to merge with my subconscious and become whole. my subconscious is my instinct, it knows what to do if I just listen to it. once we develop a relationship with one another, it will protect me from all of this confusion and fear and lack of direction, because it is my compass.

when I don't trust myself and my instinct, I sabotage myself. so while I think IT is my enemy, I am actually its enemy. 
it is telling me an absurd notion to do, and I want to do it, but I ignore it and listen to what sounds logical instead, because I don't wanna look like an idiot. however my subconscious absurdity is the way out of this logical linear prison that is making me miserable. my instinct and I have a language barrier, so it comes up in absurd thoughts which is why I told no one what I was thinking, I barely knew and was trying to figure it out myself, they certainly wouldn't know. 

I did everything in private.. what everyone told me to think say and do got me into this mess, so I stopped listening.

When I assigned something as wrong, it didn't make it wrong, it made me its enemy. 

Red hair is wrong, it is now my enemy. Swearing is wrong, it is now my enemy. 

I like red hair, it is now my friend. I love to swear, it is now my friend. 

When I remove all of the labels and categories and boxes, I turn my gaze off of fighting against my made up enemies and I can now put my energy on the real fight. I was fighting a fight about red hair being wrong this whole time and I saw the loop of its insanity. 

I freed myself and realize I've been in the wrong fight this whole time against myself and my perceived red haired enemies, and I spent years deconstructing all of what I constructed. 

when I was done with that, I got to see what is true, and what is standing before me that is keeping me from where I really wanna go, which is the life I truly want. 

my life is like an island hop in the middle of nowhere, and each island holds provisions for a certain amount of time, and if I get scared or hopeless and stay there too long, I'm going to starve and dehydrate and die. so my instinct pushes me back out into the deep to find another island. or to use relatable terminology, it pushes me into another dark night of the soul.

now, the real opponent's goal is to do whatever it takes to get me to stay on that one island - where I starve and dehydrate and die. it is insidious. since I've stopped fighting myself and I've turned towards the real wound and I see it for what it is, it's not really a threat to me anymore and doesn't make me feel hopeless and depressed and feeling like I wanna die. 

I've got to stay vigilant, because the real opponent is simply an idea, an ideas are as fast as the sea itself.

if I think about the ideas that pop into my head I can clearly see that all they wanna do is stop me from moving forward.

I was able to stop these ideas intruding on my thoughts and causing me distress when I created a world in my imagination, where I could do anything I wanted. I did all of my work in my imagination and who I was there manifested as who I am in this world.

stupid nothing idea appear to hold us back. when I allowed myself to imagine the unimaginable, it illuminated everything.

the unimaginable: 
-you can't say that
-You can't do that
-You can't think that way
-Your imagination is your enemy, it's maladaptive
-you can't behave that way
-murder, lying, hate, anger, addiction, (my worst fears)

when I went there I realized, actually, I can do whatever I want, and I did.

I was doubting myself.. am I? am I good enough? Am I successful? Am I this, am I that? 

my imagination is where I doubt myself and do all of this work to change it. This world will not let me, so I created my own world where I can and I will. once I created my world where I have 378 billion dollars in my account, I felt so free and I started to do everything I ever wanted.

it will evolve if effort is made. my imagination is where I learn all of life's lessons and solve all of my problems. not here in the world, not with the people in this world. 

in my imagination I'm an assassin, a geneticist, a mom, a friend, a sister, anything I want to be. I can go to work on a dragon, the sky is yellow, the grass is blue.. I can live 1000 lifetimes and I jump around as I please. the only thing that is allowed in these worlds is possibilities.

it's where I decide how I think and feel about what I'm going through and how I want to handle it. I already know how everybody else feels about it, they can't shut up about what they think, so I go there to get away from them.

how I feel about what exists and if I want to do it, or not, is all decided in my imagination.

free will is attached to my subconscious/imagination, not my conscious awareness. I stopped sabotaging myself when I made the connection.

Choice.. how I choose is everything (not what). a candy bar and a steak are the same. it's a distraction from the real choice.

my belief (developed in my imagination) determines everything. it isn't whether I choose a candy bar or a steak, it's what I believe about the choice that is put before me. If I believe I can only choose a candy bar or a steak then I'm lost. There are infinite choices in front of me, but because I've been given a template, all I know to believe is that there is a candy bar or a steak.

organic or not, there's no difference. if I believe that eating dog shit out of the yards of other people is nourishing my body, then it will. But I have to be 100% on the same page with my belief for this to work.

to each his own.. bespoke. I can't let doubts infect my project. I need to forge my own codes of conduct, not obey the ones that I was given. i'm here to rewrite the narrative of this world, not keep the broken one that exists alive.

I can find my way back to myself and understand what's happening, because any answer I hoped to find in this world (book, web page, even beautiful philosophy) is 3% of the truth. philosophy is there to slingshot me into the further. remembering my childhood, what could have been and what can still be.

this life is for dreamers. if there is no dream or imagination there is no way out.

The world is calling our imagination maladaptive and it's simply not true. without our imagination we can't get out. karma doesn't keep us here, sin doesn't keep us here (those things do not exist) but when I think, and die thinking, that I have unfinished business here (or debt) then I come back because I can't let it go. just like intrusive thoughts keep you up at night, not being able to imagine yourself out of this world does the same thing it keeps you tethered.

I do everything in private and I don't answer to anyone. I live in a conditional world but my true life is unconditional.

Everything in this world is 3% awareness of what I believe, and it's unencrypted. my true nature, my real (private) life, is encrypted.

even people like me, when we get this far, we sound bitter and pessimistic because this world is so grotesque. all of us who know what we're talking about have forged warrior and have now become samurai. we shed a lot of blood and have killed ourselves over and over to get where we are. we've had to destroy our own narratives thousands of times and once we did, we saw the world for what it really is. we see all of the unnecessary violence of this world and we hate it.

we are on the same page with ourselves, so we are not under any illusion or need to be a good person. we are are neither good nor bad, but necessary. our hearts and imaginations are stunning. 

and our hearts and imaginations are encrypted, so others don't really get to see that part of us. they see the unencrypted part which appears to them as being a complete asshole, but because of this delusioned rainbow coffee world, we will always be seen as the villain.

1m5itft,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m5itft/does_the_keurig_kduo_essentials_coffee_maker/,Does the Keurig K-Duo Essentials Coffee Maker Truly Meet Your Brewing Needs Review?,"**My Experience Using the Keurig K-Duo Essentials 611247382868 Coffee Maker**

Not being a morning person, I rely heavily on coffee to kickstart my day. The Keurig K-Duo Essentials 611247382868 has been sitting on my kitchen counter for a few weeks, and let me say, this dual brewer has made my mornings slightly less chaotic. For someone like me who loves options, the ability to use both K-Cup pods and traditional ground coffee is a huge plus. It feels like two machines in one, but let’s break down its key features and how it performs.

**Design and Build Quality**

Sleek and modern, this coffee maker in its moonlight gray finish fits seamlessly into my kitchen's aesthetic. Its dimensions—13.44"" x 12.27"" x 12.74""—mean it’s chunky enough to make a statement but compact enough not to dominate your countertop. I appreciated the matte black finish for its ability to hide fingerprints. Plus, at 8.47 pounds, it’s light enough that I managed to shift it around on my own when rearranging my kitchen setup.

**Key Benefits**

- You can brew both single-serve cups (perfect for afternoons) and 12-cup carafes (great for mornings when my spouse and I both need caffeine).  
- Brewing amounts can be adjusted, offering an 8, 10, or 12 oz. single-serve option or an equivalent number of cups for the carafe.  
- The 60 oz. shared reservoir significantly reduces the frequency of refills, which, frankly, is a lifesaver during busy mornings.  

[Check Keurig 611247382868 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07w56c9yq/)

**Brew Performance**

In terms of brewing quality, this coffee maker holds its own. The coffee comes out full-flavored, thanks to the machine's consistent temperature control. I tested lightweight roast K-Cup pods for a single cup and my favorite rich dark ground coffee for the carafe. Both options yielded flavorful results, with no hint of bitterness. The pause-and-pour feature made a significant impression on me—it allowed me to sneak a quick pour just two minutes into the carafe’s brewing cycle without creating a huge mess.  

One day, running late for work, I instinctively grabbed for the pause button, poured a cup from the carafe, and sprinted out the kitchen. It was still hot, and the flavor hadn’t been compromised—a big win in my books.

**Energy Efficiency**

Keurig has done a commendable job keeping energy consumption in check. Auto-shutoff ensures the machine powers down after one idle minute for single-serve or after extended inactivity with the carafe's heating plate. Being someone who forgets to turn things off regularly, this feature has likely saved me a few bucks already.

**Areas of Improvement**

Not everything about this machine is perfect, though:  

- The machine lacks a strong brew option, which could frustrate aficionados craving an extra caffeine punch.  
- The carafe size, while convenient for larger gatherings, makes the machine slightly bulkier than single-serve-only options.  
- K-Duo’s reusable coffee filter is sold separately, so you’ll need to budget a little extra if you want to go full eco-friendly.  

**Ease of Use**

If you’re like me, you want a coffee maker you can use when you’re half-asleep. With buttons and no fiddly touchscreen menus, this one gets it right. Pairing its fully automatic operation with physical buttons means operating it couldn’t be simpler. The filter baskets for both the ground coffee and K-Cup slot are straightforward to load or remove, and cleaning hasn’t been a hassle.

**Competitive Options**

When considering alternatives, two products stand out. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, another dual brewer, offers similar versatility but features a smaller water reservoir. It’s also a tad slower to brew, in my experience. On the premium end, you’ve got the Ninja Hot and Cold Brewed System, which goes a step further by allowing you to make cold brews and specialty coffees. However, that’s reflected in its higher price tag. Compared to these, the Keurig K-Duo Essentials feels like the middle ground—it’s less expensive than Ninja while offering more brewing options than Hamilton Beach.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Given its performance and dual-use functionality, I feel like this appliance gives you affordable quality. While it’s not the cheapest coffee maker on the market, it feels justified in its price due to the flexibility offered by ground coffee and K-Cup compatibility. For small gatherings, offices, and personal use, I consider it budget-friendly for what it delivers.

(MODS I'm doing my best please don't ban me 🫂🌸🦋💕)

EDITED
From my own experience swimming in deep waters: 

There is the potential to become overwhelmed in pessimism and nihilism and disorder diagnoses from discovering the truth. I can deny it, but I can't avoid it.

so, how do I deal with the fallout of this hopelessness if I'm unwilling to deny it .. ""That's life, right?"" Maybe, but no, it doesn't have to be. I didn't take it at face value and I had to get creative and figure out how I could change this instead of being destroyed by.

why does it feel like war every time I look for answers.. where is the hope? everything tells me how to deny, suppress, dismiss and stay in it but I want to get out of it!
----
along my journey I learned to set my mind to disengage and observe everything without judging it.

I learned I can't change, correct or save/repair anything or anyone. because of this I was able to learn what I was here to do, find purpose, mind you this took years to discover, it's not an overnight thing.

until I mastered  (in my own way) how to observe and be silent, I lost a lot of battles and became exhausted and hopeless. I turned the despair of those losses around one day. 

I saw what needing to be a good person was doing to me and everyone in this world. in order to win I need to learn how to become a thief, and a warrior, a liar and a cheater. I'm not going to lie and cheat and steal from people, no, I'm going to do all of these things to my opposition, but I have to know what I'm dealing with and I can't be a good person to do this. none of this is about being a good person, I discovered for myself. That's why people who wound and destroy tell you to lead with love (not yourself). if you believe you have to lead with anything other than yourself, you have are exposed and all I got were wounds, instead of learning lessons and becoming stronger.

I couldn't go through this life not knowing what wounded me so here's how wounds operate to help or consume us..

******there are two types of wounds:*******
one Wound is from a friend, and the other Wound is the collective pessimism and categorizing of our age.

the pessimism it is the collective thoughts of everyone's septic state of mind. every time someone has a ""bad"" thought or a ""bad"" feeling, they say I'm a good person, I can't think that way, or I have to feel good, not bad.. instead of dealing with that wound (that was created by them), they rip it out and throw it away, but it doesn't disappear it has to go somewhere. 

8 billion people are ripping wounds out of themselves and ""throwing it away"" 10x a day or more in order to feel better- 

it's a tragedy because we don't understand that that is what we're doing, but most people do not care at all. now all of these wounds have collected together and it influences the world through the feelings we go around feeling that makes us hopeless for some reason, or for no reason at all.

The first wound that threw me into existential crisis after existential crisis/the one that makes me uncomfortable with staying put, is my friend. some people called this wound the dark night of the soul. 

The other wound is a collective form of 8 billion people, which is why it feels crushing. i'm desperate to find answers and it leverages my desperation to bury me in pessimism and hopelessness in order to stagnate and decay.

I came to understand this to help me stay balanced in existential crisis:

my friend wound is there to push me out of harms way and back out to the deep, where it is safe. it seems like it's trying to kill me but it's doing it for me because - it is me...

when I stop labeling the world as bad evil and dangerous, my friend wound becomes just my friend. I understand that there isn't anything evil, that there isn't anything bad, that there isn't anything dangerous, so I 
Get rid of that injured thinking, I get rid of all the rules, I get rid of being obedient to everything I've been taught and I wipe the slight clean and began listening to myself. I destroy everything and I begin to rebuild on my terms. 

I allow my conscious awareness to merge with my subconscious and become whole. my subconscious is my instinct, it knows what to do if I just listen to it. once we develop a relationship with one another, it will protect me from all of this confusion and fear and lack of direction, because it is my compass.

when I don't trust myself and my instinct, I sabotage myself. so while I think IT is my enemy, I am actually its enemy. 
it is telling me an absurd notion to do, and I want to do it, but I ignore it and listen to what sounds logical instead, because I don't wanna look like an idiot. however my subconscious absurdity is the way out of this logical linear prison that is making me miserable. my instinct and I have a language barrier, so it comes up in absurd thoughts which is why I told no one what I was thinking, I barely knew and was trying to figure it out myself, they certainly wouldn't know. 

I did everything in private.. what everyone told me to think say and do got me into this mess, so I stopped listening.

When I assigned something as wrong, it didn't make it wrong, it made me its enemy. 

Red hair is wrong, it is now my enemy. Swearing is wrong, it is now my enemy. 

I like red hair, it is now my friend. I love to swear, it is now my friend. 

When I remove all of the labels and categories and boxes, I turn my gaze off of fighting against my made up enemies and I can now put my energy on the real fight. I was fighting a fight about red hair being wrong this whole time and I saw the loop of its insanity. 

I freed myself and realize I've been in the wrong fight this whole time against myself and my perceived red haired enemies, and I spent years deconstructing all of what I constructed. 

when I was done with that, I got to see what is true, and what is standing before me that is keeping me from where I really wanna go, which is the life I truly want. 

my life is like an island hop in the middle of nowhere, and each island holds provisions for a certain amount of time, and if I get scared or hopeless and stay there too long, I'm going to starve and dehydrate and die. so my instinct pushes me back out into the deep to find another island. or to use relatable terminology, it pushes me into another dark night of the soul.

now, the real opponent's goal is to do whatever it takes to get me to stay on that one island - where I starve and dehydrate and die. it is insidious. since I've stopped fighting myself and I've turned towards the real wound and I see it for what it is, it's not really a threat to me anymore and doesn't make me feel hopeless and depressed and feeling like I wanna die. 

I've got to stay vigilant, because the real opponent is simply an idea, an ideas are as fast as the sea itself.

if I think about the ideas that pop into my head I can clearly see that all they wanna do is stop me from moving forward.

I was able to stop these ideas intruding on my thoughts and causing me distress when I created a world in my imagination, where I could do anything I wanted. I did all of my work in my imagination and who I was there manifested as who I am in this world.

stupid nothing idea appear to hold us back. when I allowed myself to imagine the unimaginable, it illuminated everything.

the unimaginable: 
-you can't say that
-You can't do that
-You can't think that way
-Your imagination is your enemy, it's maladaptive
-you can't behave that way
-murder, lying, hate, anger, addiction, (my worst fears)

in my imagination I'm an assassin, a geneticist, a mom, a friend, a sister, anything I want to be. I can go to work on a dragon, the sky is yellow, the grass is blue.. I can live 1000 lifetimes and I jump around as I please. the only thing that is allowed in these worlds is possibilities.

it's where I decide how I think and feel about what I'm going through and how I want to handle it. I already know how everybody else feels about it, they can't shut up about what they think, so I go there to get away from them.

how I feel about what exists and if I want to do it, or not, is all decided in my imagination.

“So it's really that easy, you say family meet family, and that's it?” Cadet asked as he fumbled to hold a current RNI carbine with freshly printed furniture to fit his Corvian frame correctly.

“Aye, and no,” Jason answered as he gently corrected the angle at which Cadet held the weapon, “so far as the family's concerned, you're in.  We still have to make it legal though.  There's a couple of ways we could do it, but the fastest would probably be finding a Star Sailor magistrate.   I guess a judge in the Republic or the CIP could help us too, but judges don't usually do that sort of legal work.  Any which way, this is an in-person kind of legal thing, and even then in the Republic we'd be going to the DOR to file everything.”  Cadet squeezed the trigger as Jason was still trying to sort through his own explanation.  The slug of ferrous material didn't quite break the sound barrier, but on the range that wouldn't have mattered much anyway.  In any case, even this lower velocity weapon had more recoil than Cadet was prepared to deal with; the shot went wide.

Cadet clicked his beak at the target at the ten yard mark with irritation.  It still showed no hits.  “Could anybody stop it happening?”

“I guess so.  There are laws to stop people from kidnapping kids to raise as their own, but...” Jason trailed off as Cadet's feathers slicked close in.

“But I ran away from a mom who didn't care enough to notice.” Cadet said as he squeezed off another round.  It went wide of the target.

Jason blew through his teeth and leaned against their lane's dividing wall before he said, “Well, that's one way to put things.”

“Are you okay?” Cadet asked, and Jason was once again bemused with his habit of jumping from topic to topic.  Not so bemused as he was by Cadet's next shot hitting the bullseye of the target in the lane to their left; its occupant let out a sudden bark of laughter and called out something about taking credit for the shot.

“Maybe not, but I can regulate.  Talking about that, turns out I kinda got used to sharing sleeping quarters, you mind if I drag my mattress into your cabin?”  The soft whirring and clicking of magaccs from the lanes to the left and right of them played point and counterpoint with the ferrous material striking the sandbags stacked along the far wall.  Another almost like home thing.

Cadet missed the target again.  It looked to Jason almost like he came nearer hitting it this time.  “Sure,” Cadet said as he glared at the target as if it was to blame for his aim, “I guess you don't want to be alone with your thoughts?”

“Something like that,” Jason admitted.  He didn't see any point in keeping up a brave face now that they were all but home.

“It's not fair.  You need another you, and I'm not like you and can't do the you stuff,” Cadet grumbled as he squeezed off another round.  That too, missed.

“I don't follow,” Jason said slowly as he tried to parse that.  “If you mean you wish you could talk me through things the way I do for you, then thanks.  Don't worry about not having talents, if it's something you want to be good at you have to practice.”

“How do you even start practicing basically magic,” Cadet grumbled before changing subjects abruptly again, “Did you find out anything about Vai?”

“Spinal surgeries are tricky,” Jason carefully told him. “I wish my mom was here.  She really is as good as they say.  Which isn't to say that Doctor Yiovquix isn't very good too, it's just my mom is the best.  They said that she can get the use of her legs and tail back, but actually walking and swimming again will take time.  And work.  Time and work...""  Jason's voice trailed off as he began to think about the phrase before he shook himself, “She'll probably be out of surgery in a couple hours.”

“I was watching when the doctors called her parents.  She's going to leave us, isn't she?  She already has a  family to get back to.""

“That's the thing about cousins,” Jason said reassuringly, “Just because they don't all live on your home ship with you doesn't mean they aren't still family.  There will be visits, and calls, and we'll get a server going for a game we all like.”

“I... I guess so,” Cadet said.  He fired again.  He hit the target.  Nowhere near the bullseye, and less than a quarter inch from it's edge, but he hit it.

*Among the Star Tides We Rage* thrummed beneath Jason's feet.  She was more sorrowful, more full of joy, but Jason could feel her fury rise.  She was a warship, not a home ship after all.  A ship for the clans rather than of them, and she was angry that a clan ship had been touched, and clan crew had been hurt.  However, in the lane with Cadet, there was calm and comfort in that anger.  “See?” Jason said, “Practice.”

Vincent found he quite liked the enlisted mess.  It reminded him of his days in Her Majesty's Royal Navy.  Which wasn't to say that the officers' mess was as stuffy as others he'd seen, but officers in any military are afflicted with an inability to relax unless actually on liberty or leave.  The enlisted knew how to snatch at the chance when they got it.  Besides, the coffee in the officers' mess wasn't any better than in the enlisted.  It was starkly furnished, but not uncomfortable, with a utilitarian attention in the difference in height between the various kinds of biological Terran crew and the Star Sailors or the odd other lightworlder.  There was an equal utilitarian attention to the difference in weight and density, as the furniture meant for use by Terrans was sturdier in addition to being smaller, and Vincent sometimes wondered whether these enlisted had a brawl for fun like he and his mates did during his four years.  They got raucous enough of an evening.  However, he wasn't there to watch the enlisted blow off steam, he was there for coffee and a chat.

The watch had just changed over, so tired voidsmen and troopers tromped in to gulp down a dinner of eggs and bacon before they snatched some sack time, or else enjoyed their alcohol rations.  Some of them took their ration as liqueur dumped into coffee, and Vincent found himself envying them their youth, if not their choice of beverage.  He was quietly grateful that somebody had let the galley know he didn't want any alcohol, and didn't need to politely decline.  He was also quietly grateful that Lord-Admiral Brixdron had ignored his mutterings about preferring to handle things on his own and sent directions to a meeting of a sobriety group aboard.  Then again, neither the night watch nor his own struggles had anything to do with the chat he wanted to have.  Or maybe chats.  One of the people he wanted to talk to came in with the morning watch crew, mainly dragging themselves to the race appropriate hot stimulants on offer, coffee for Terrans and a strange mushroom tincture for others.  Rose was a morning person, apparently, since she got her coffee with that brightly cheerful bounce in her step that morning people afflict normal people with.  Her cheer wasn't diminished as she slid into the sturdily comfortable chair across the table from Vincent and took a long sip from her steaming mug.

“Good morning,” she chimed at him.

Vincent suppressed a grin as he replied as was becoming his habit with her, “It's morning.  Let's see if there's anything good about it.”

“Well, you're here, so that's a start.”

Vincent snorted and retorted, “Bad start.”

“You oughta dye your fur green and live in a trash can, you wold grouch,” Rose said in a poor imitation at scolding.  It was spoiled by her giggling. 

Vincent waved his hand in front of himself as if he could batter away her laughter and took a sip of his own coffee.  The galley master knew what he or she was about.  “The grouches would kick me out for being too grumpy,” he said, finally letting the humor touch his voice, “God only knows why you put up with me.”

“Oh hush,” she said, with something that more closely approached scolding.  “You're a nice man, Vincent.  You can grump all you want, but I know what you're like when the chips are down.”

That remark drew attention to how she looked.  Rose wore what  looked like a duty uniform for the voidsmen without any rank or qualifications or awards, and while it was cut to fit a Doggo woman, it hung loosely on her shoulders as if it had been made in anticipation of a more well-muscled frame.  She wasn't looking anywhere so gaunt as she had, but her freedom was less than a week old.  Scant time to put flesh back on hungry bones.  Scant time also to regrow her shaved coat of fur, but there were medicines and creams to speed that along.  Those seemed to be working somewhat, but her fur was hardly thick enough to be called a coat yet.  She looked better than she had, but even so it wrung Vincent's heart.  “I guess so,” Vincent said somberly.

She furrowed her brow at him, then a light of recognition flashed in her eyes.  “Thank you,” she told him with equal solemnity, “I said it before, but I can't say it enough.  Thank you.”

Vincent coughed.  There seemed to be something stuck in his throat for some reason.  “Ah, that's not worth talking about.  Listen, Laurence said he'd be by this morning to tell me how things are going to go.”  He felt awkward, changing the subject so abruptly, but it was better than listening to the woman tell him what a hero he was again. 

“*The Anvil?*”

“Yeah,” he said, “haven't you met him yet?”

“Honestly,” she said as she laid her ears back sheepishly and twisted her mug on the table, “I'm a little nervous about meeting any of them.”

“They don't bite.”

“Easy for you to say,” Rose said as she rolled her eyes at him, “You're Vincent the Victorious.  People are already making up all kinds of crazy stories about you.  What if I ask about one of the stories where The Hammer and The Anvil smashed pirates between them, and The Anvil, *The Anvil* tells me that was made up?  I'd look like an idiot fangirl.”

Vincent sputtered, then coughed.  Hot coffee wasn't supposed to go down that way. “Vincent the *what?*”

People who'd never been among military men might have missed it, the slight stiffening of posture, the minuscule quieting of conversation, the occasional flick of gazes all in the same direction.  Rose was someone who hadn't quite spent the tame among military types to notice as she started in, “They're saying online that you are the George family Hound, more than they are just your Humans.  There's a rumor going around that they've been your family's Humans going all the way back to before the uplift.”

“That's the way of things,” Major General (retired) Laurence “The Anvil” George said sadly as he slid into a chair beside Rose, politely ignoring both Vincent's pained groan and her shocked sputtering.   “Someone in the family does something anybody with a little courage and luck would do, and it gets blown out of proportion.  I'm sorry it's touched you so soon.”

“I always knew it wasn't up to me,” Vincent said, “what other people think.   It still throws me for a loop though.”

Laurence shrugged and took a sip of his own coffee.  Then he mused, “Well, that's the right way to look at things.  Jason told me you're a Catholic?  Most of the family is, even on the Star Sailor side these days.  They tend to be more reserved though.  The point is we do have a chaplain to hold mass and take confession aboard.  Not a priest, mind you, since everybody fights, everybody works, but the church did authorize him.”

“Thanks,” Vincent grunted and savored another sip of coffee and the feel of the room relaxing again.  The men were used to a retired major general spending time in their mess.

“I'm glad you're here, Rose.” the legend went on just as if he was as normal a person as anybody else.  Vincent supposed that he really was as normal as anybody else, or felt that way whatever he's done.  “What you told the medical team about where- anyway, it was enough to go on.  My wife,"" Vincent was a little startled by how much the pride ringing in those two words could warm his old heart, ""has managed to find your little sister.  The pirates left her for dead, but I figure you are strong folk.  She kept her life and Iris says she's more than happy you're alive too.  She'll be there when we meet up with the *Among the Star Tides We Sing.*""

Rose's eyes bulged further and further as Laurence explained things until she breathed, “The *We Sing?*”

“A lot of people don't know, and are disappointed to find out when they step aboard,” the grandfatherly old man said, “She wears the name on a new hull.  The ship that Terrans made their first friends with the Star Sailors is still entombed in orbit of Terra herself.  It's a tradition for us to not let a ship's name die even if she's killed.”

“Oh... but still, she's an important ship,” rose said as if still trying to catch her breath.

“Every home ship is important.  Every clan ship is important,” Laurence said, “speaking of, *The Long Way* is in the rolls, and another hull will wear her name one day.”

Vincent found that he had to speak past a lump in his throat, “Thank you.  But uh, her hull is still good.  A new reactor...”

“Will make her a new ship, with a new heart, and you I think are done wandering alone between the stars,” Laurence finished for him.  “But anyway, we'll be meeting up with the *We Sing* in three or four days, and we'll get some time to greet the people we've been missing.  After that, it's the formal homecoming.  A bit more stuffy than I'd like, but rituals are sometimes more for the people watching than the people in them.  People care abut Jason, and the want to see him welcomed home, so we'll do it in the Star Sailor way.  Besides, *The Long Way* gave her life to bring you all home.  She should be honored.”  Vincent found himself nodding along to the explanation, and when it turned to explaining the explanation of the homecoming ceremony itself, and his part in it, he listened intently.

It took only three days, by ship's clock, for the anticipated rendezvous.  Plenty of time to settle into something close to relaxation like Jason and Vincent, or to screw themselves into anxious knots like Cadet and Isis-Magdalene, which left Vai bouncing between both ends of those moods.  She settled somewhere in the middle whenever she focused on physical therapy, or rather both nerves and relaxation relented in her determined grit to be able to stand during the ceremony.  She had confided to Vincent that she viewed altering the gown Isis-Magdalene had sewn for her to accommodate a wheelchair to be tantamount to ruination.  Jason ferreted that same admission out of her by joking companionably while she was in the recovery area of the ship's medbay about pushing herself too hard.  Feeling pretty was important to her, so he took the problem to Trandrai, and suggested printing up a set of braces that wouldn't stick out like ripped sails.  She seized on that line and hauled for all she was worth, and in things like that, she was worth more than a little.  The voidsmen in engineering were startled, amused, and indulgent of her, but even if they weren't she'd have gotten what she wanted from them from pure force of will.  They had used the time they had to get as ready as they could.  

When those three days were up, and the unmistakable clamor of ship-to-ship docking shuddered through the *We Rage,* Jason surprised himself.  For all his being past his Halfway and hefting a man's burdens on his young shoulders, his feet beat a path through the warship to the forward port airlock without delay.  Now, on the point of having them to hand again at last, his heart ached for his mother and father as any boy's would in his shoes.  He wasn't the only one.  Trandrai heeled him eagerly while Cadet and Isis-Magdalene were torn between hurrying to keep up and hanging back fighting to overcome nerves, and Vai was pushed along in a wheelchair by an orderly she wasn't able to escape.  She kicked at a footrest irritably as they waited for the readout on the airlock hatch to give the all clear.  Jason bounced on the balls of his feet, Trandrai stared at the readout as if she could will it to open faster, Isis-Magdalene regarded the hatch with a mix of relief and apprehension, and Cadet muttered about meeting so many new people.   The readout flashed the all clear in green letters, the hatch buzzed, and swung open inward, but Jason didn't wait for it to stop.  He was through the hatch and sprinting down the short umbilical between airlocks with his eyes fixed on Maxwell George.

He didn't stop when he reached his father; he barreled through the sturdy man and sent him staggering a few steps back as he struggled to embrace his son at long last and keep his feet.  Jason's arms didn't quite wrap all the way around his father, but he squeezed for all he was worth anyway.  There were words, but Jason couldn't hear them.  He was busy tearing his eye from his father's beaming face to find his mother, and Brigid George was there too, weeping.  The boy let go of his father with one arm to invite his mother into the embrace, and Jason found himself crushed between them.  He could hear some of the words now, “My boy!” and “You're home!” and “You made it!” and “Praise God!” among other things.  He head another thing too, the *Among the Star Tides We Sing* thrummed beneath his feet.  She filled the boy's ears with the sound of home.

Vincent arrived at the airlock just in time to see the Chief and Trandrai dart through it at a sprint.  He found himself smiling at their joy as he caught up to Cadet and Isis-Magdalene, who were hanging back with Vai who was casting an impatient look up at the orderly behind her.  The young Bigkitty man seemed impervious to her glares, since he waited for the hatch to fully open before he began to push her through, which gave Vincent time to reach the other two and gather them with a hand on each shoulder.  They started forward with a gentle push, and Cadet fairly glued himself to Vincent's side while Isis-Magdalene made a decent attempt for regal serenity. 

“Nervous?” the old man asked softly, as the other end of the umbilical erupted in joy as the two runners reached their kin.

“What if they don't like me?” Cadet asked quietly, nearly too quietly to be heard. 

Isis-Magdalene hadn't missed it.  “Impossible,” she declared, and at his narrowed eye glance on her she said, “you are the kind all good people will like once you let them in.”

“If the Chief's family is anything like the Chief, they'll give you a shot,” Vincent whispered in his adoptive son's ear.  The boy clicked his beak and puffed his feathers out as he squared his shoulders.  Vincent gave him an encouraging squeeze.  “What about you, Little Lady?”

“I have grown used to our privacy, of no charges having need of me,"" she mumbled, “I fear I have not grown in courage or wisdom despite such fine examples on our journey.”

“That is a problem for when you're a woman grown,” Vincent said, “today it's just us and our families.”

And with those words, they were in a cacophony of joy.  The George family had, unsurprisingly, filled up most of the available space, and most of the rest of it was taken up by towering blue-skinned four-armed Star Sailors who were as much family as anybody named George.  Although one of those only spared Jason one of his hands a brief touch and a glace from the embrace he had around Trandrai.  Vincent could add two and two without coming up six, and concluded that the man was her father.  All the rest, except a man and woman who had the Chief nearly crushed between them, split their attention between the two children.  Men, women, kids of many ages, and Vincent wasn't surprised when the Georges they'd already met on the *We Rage* came behind his little party.  They joined in the knot of welcome home, and there were a few women who's faces told of the relief at husbands come home, among them Rear Admiral (retired) Iris “The Hammer” George.  She was a wall of dignitified gravity, spoiled somewhat by how fondly she gazed upon the scene before her.

Standing apart, more qiuetly, but no less joyful were four Lutrae, five once Vai met them in her wheelchair with her orderly, a man, a woman, and two young pups.  The pups crawled up into the chair gingerly to bury their faces in their sister's shirt while the nan and woman clasped her hands and pressed their foreheads aganst the sides of her head between them  while she tried to return the gesture to all four of them at once. The pups made squeals of delight mingled with sobs of the same, while her parents tried to tell her how glad they were to have her back through their own tears and sobs, while the girl just repeated, “I love you, I love you, I love you,” as she twisted and squirmed as far as she was able to touch and grasp and embrace the family she'd pined for in the night watches on their long journey home.

Meanwhile, an Axxaakk man and woman stood with regal poise apart from both the Georges' and Vai's family's joy awaiting Isis-Magdalene.  She glided toward them with a trembling poise, and all three of their solemn faces broke into warm smiles once she was in arms reach.  Her mother bent down and drew a finger down her cheek and along her jaw, and her father did the same on the other side.  Before their hands left her face fully, the girl gently grasped their fingers, and they said some quiet words together.  The girl's noble father let tears roll from unblinking eyes, as if he feared his daughter would disappear if he blinked.  Even  so, they sat down  on the floor together in a tight circle, all gently holding hands.  If those two didn't shine with pride in their daughter, Vincent would buy a hat just to eat it.

Vincent would have been content to stand there and drink it all in, but Cadet showed no sign of stirring from his side.  He was just deciding to begin working their way toward Jason and Trandrai, when a young George cousin said, “Jay-Jay, why are you wearing an eye patch?”

Vincent could have heard a hair snap.

The Chief found himself with a little more room to breath and said, “It was the price I paid to keep a promise.”

Everyone in the George family old enough to understand suddenly had sorrow, no, grief mingled with their joy.  Vincent felt it break over the gathering like a wave.  Then, something strange happened.  The Hammer glared at The Anvil, who gave his wife a serene look.  The gray hared patriarch held the hard flat-eyed gaze of the matriarch, and it was she who relented.  Laurence George knelt down to kiss his grandson on the forehead and intoned, “Let me be the wind at your back.  Your honor is family honor.”  Then, everyone, Georges and Star Sailors alike did the same.  The Chief looked somewhere between relieved and somber at the small ceremony, a repetition of what had happened a week earlier with what looked like the whole family, or as much of it could be peeled away from duty.  Then, the grandfather locked eyes with Vincent and said, “Family, meet family.”  His gesture took in the whole room, and as simply as that, Vincent and Cadet were enveloped with Vai and Isis-Magdalene along with their families.

At some point, Colonel Maxwell “The Loyal” Geeorge was clasping Vincent's hand in a vice and saying, “Brother, I'm so glad you made it home with Jason.  I'm so happy to finally meet you.”

“I'm glad to meet you too, brother,” Vincent found himself saying.  It didn't feel the slightest bit awkward to call Max The Loyal “brother,"" it felt right.  “Sorry it took me so long.  We took the long way home.”

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KuPS vs. Kairat: A Clash of Champions and Consistency, Minus the Midfield Mischief**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Champions League qualifying clash that’s equal parts chess match and circus act—depending on who shows up. KuPS, Finland’s reigning kings, host Kazakhstan’s Kairat in a first-leg showdown that’s as much about injuries as it is about ambition. Let’s break this down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a sports bar after a long night.

---

### Parsing the Odds: When the Numbers Speak (and When They Don’t)

First, let’s address the elephant in the room: **there are no official odds provided for this match**. The data you’ve lovingly included is for a Jaro vs. VPS Vaasa bout, which is as relevant to this analysis as a pineapple on pizza. But hey, we’ll improvise! Let’s treat this like a game of “sports Jeopardy” and use the given team stats as our clues.

KuPS enters this match with a **three-match home winning streak**, which is about as reliable as a Swiss watch if you ignore the fact that their last away game ended in a 1-1 draw against VPS. They’re missing **midfielder Samuel Pasanen**, whose cruciate ligament injury has left their midfield as disjointed as a TikTok dance without the music.

Kairat, meanwhile, boasts an **eight-match unbeaten streak**, a run so consistent it could qualify for a Netflix documentary titled *The Unstoppable Kazakh*. But they’re also without **Elder Santana and Joao Paulo**, two players whose absences leave their squad looking like a buffet where the main course just walked out.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Red Cards, and the Ghost of Jaro’s Loss

Let’s start with KuPS. Their recent 1-1 draw to VPS was a microcosm of their season: flashes of brilliance (hello, three home wins!) but a defense that’s as leaky as a sieve in a monsoon. Without Pasanen, their midfield will need to channel the spirit of a well-meaning but clumsy intern—trying hard, but likely to spill coffee on the playbook.

Kairat’s eight-match unbeaten

1m5irhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m5irhh/does_mccafe_premium_roast_kcup_pods_deliver_rich/,Does McCafe Premium Roast K-Cup Pods Deliver Rich Flavor? A Comprehensive Review,"McCafe 10043000080372 Premium Roast Coffee has made its way into my daily coffee ritual, and honestly, it has left me with quite an impression. I’ve tried numerous medium roast options in the past, especially in the K-cup department, but there’s something special about this blend. It feels familiar—smooth, rich, and bold enough to get me through busy mornings. Despite loving it, there are details worth noting, both amazing and, well, less ideal.

**Smooth Design for Keurig Users**  
The beauty of these K-cup pods lies in their simplicity. Compatible with all Keurig K-Cup coffee makers, they’ve taken away the stress of figuring out whether it works with my machine. I’m the type who frowns seeing that dreaded “incompatible pod” message, so McCafe’s guarantee of compatibility is a win for tech-challenged coffee aficionados like myself. Not to mention, the recyclable material gives me peace of mind—although, I did discover that not all communities recycle these pods, which dampened the eco-friendly vibe just slightly.

**Taste That Hits the Spot Every Morning**  
I’ll admit it; I’m a bit of a coffee snob. When they say McCafe Premium Roast lets you enjoy the café experience at home, they aren’t stretching the truth too far. The medium roast offers a comforting, well-rounded flavor. There’s no overpowering bitterness; instead, every cup offers a smooth body and a clean finish. My mom, notorious for picking out even a hint of acidic coffee, declared this one as “mom-approved,” which is high praise coming from her.  

[Check McCafe 10043000080372 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08dbyjkvw/)

**Ingredients You Can Appreciate**  
McCafe emphasizes their use of 100% premium Arabica beans. I’ve noticed that coffees using Arabica beans tend to have a superior taste, and this blend clearly benefits from it. The beans are sourced responsibly from mountain regions, contributing not only to a better flavor profile but also to a healthier planet—an aspect more brands should really care about in today’s market. These pods are also certified Orthodox Union Kosher, which might appeal to those mindful about certifications or dietary preferences.  

**Advantages**  
- Made with 100% Arabica coffee beans for a smooth, rich taste.  
- Pods are compatible with all Keurig K-Cup machines.  
- Medium roast with no sharp acidity, great for sensitive palates.  
- Certified Kosher and responsibly sourced coffee.  

**Negatives**  
- Not all communities accept recyclable pods, which limits sustainable disposal.  
- Those who prefer a bolder, more dark roast flavor might not find this satisfying.  

**Rivals Worth Mentioning**  
Comparing this medium roast to the likes of Green Mountain Coffee’s K-cup offerings or Starbucks Pike Place Roast, you’ll notice subtle but impactful differences. Green Mountain’s blends often lean sweeter, while Starbucks offerings tend to pack more robust punchiness, but McCafe hits that middle ground, making it smooth without feeling bland. Starbucks does edge ahead when it comes to those who crave intensity, though McCafe delivers a more universal flavor that doesn’t alienate casual coffee drinkers.  

**Financial Value**  
From a cost-efficiency perspective, it’s safe to say this product offers good value. Without disclosing numbers, let’s just say you get enough quality pods in the pack to last a long time, assuming you don’t guzzle down five cups a day. For those concerned with quantity-to-quality ratios, this coffee is worth the splurge for Keurig machine owners.

the materials used in the construction of card holders directly impact their longevity and aesthetic appeal. Popular options include premium silicone,PU leather,and durable polycarbonate. Silicone offers flexibility and shock absorption,while PU leather provides a sleek and professional look. Polycarbonate offers rigidity and impact resistance. Each material is chosen for its specific properties, ensuring the card holder can withstand daily wear and tear.

**Card Capacity and Accessibility:**
The capacity and accessibility of cards are important considerations. Many card holders can comfortably hold 2-4 cards,striking a balance between slimness and practicality. Some designs incorporate a sliding mechanism or elastic band to facilitate easy access to the cards. This allows users to quickly retrieve and replace cards without unnecessary fumbling.

**Integrated Stand Feature:**
Some advanced models of card holders now include an integrated stand feature.This allows the user to prop up their phone for hands-free viewing of videos, video calls, or presentations. The stand is typically designed to be easily deployed and retracted, adding an extra layer of utility to the card holder.

The card holder for phone provides a range of benefits that simplify daily life and enhance convenience. These benefits address common challenges faced by smartphone users and provide practical solutions.

## FAQs section

Addressing common questions and concerns provides potential buyers with the information needed to make an informed decision.

**Will the adhesive damage my phone case?**
No, the 3M VHB adhesive is designed to be residue-free upon removal. However, it is recommended to test a small, inconspicuous area of the phone case first to ensure compatibility. Certain phone case materials,such as textured silicone or heavily treated leather,may not provide optimal adhesion. Cleaning the surface with an alcohol wipe before application improves adhesion.

**Does the card holder work with wireless charging?**
Wireless charging compatibility depends on the specific card holder model and the thickness of the cards inserted. Some thin card holders may allow for wireless charging, while others may interfere with the charging process. It is advisable to remove the cards or the card holder entirely for optimal wireless charging performance. Many people find that moving the card holder to the very bottom of the phone allows for wireless charging.

**How many cards can the card holder realistically hold?**
Most card holders are designed to comfortably hold 2-4 cards. Overloading the card holder can stretch the material and compromise its ability to securely hold the cards. It is recommended to stick to the recommended card capacity to ensure optimal performance and prevent cards from slipping out. Metal credit cards may take up more room than plastic cards.

**Is the RFID blocking effective for all types of cards?**
the RFID blocking technology is effective for most common credit cards, debit cards, and ID cards that use RFID or NFC (Near Field Communication) technology. However, some older cards or access badges that use different frequencies may not be fully protected. The metal lining interrupts the signals used by RFID or NFC, which prevents unwanted reading of the card data.

**Why the Leather Bum Bag Reigns Supreme in 2025**

Beyond their obvious hands-free convenience, trendy leather bum bags offer several key advantages that make them a top choice for 2025:

* **Versatility:** They seamlessly transition from casual daytime outings to more polished evening events.

* **Conscious Choice:** With a growing focus on ethical and sustainable practices in the leather industry, many brands offer responsibly sourced options.

**Ready to rock your leather bum bag? Here are some fresh ways to style it for 2025:**

1. **The Crossbody Cool:** This is arguably the most popular way to wear your leather bum bag right now. Sling it diagonally across your chest, with the bag resting comfortably on your front. This look is perfect for urban adventures, coffee runs, or casual meetups. Pair it with a simple tee and jeans, or layer it over a blazer for an unexpected twist. For a truly modern vibe, consider a slightly slouchier leather design.
2. **Waist Cinching Sophistication:** Don't underestimate the classic waist-worn style! In 2025, it's all about wearing your trendy leather bum bag higher on the waist, almost like a belt. This creates a flattering silhouette, especially when paired with dresses, jumpsuits, or high-waisted trousers. Opt for a sleek, structured leather design in a solid color to maintain an elegant feel.
3. **Over the Shoulder Effortless:** For a relaxed yet stylish approach, simply drape your leather bum bag over one shoulder, much like a mini handbag. Let it sit snugly at your side. This casual method works wonderfully with oversized knits, tailored coats, or even sporty attire, adding a touch of effortless cool.
4. **Under Your Layers:** For a subtle yet practical look, wear your trendy leather bum bag under a jacket or coat. This keeps your essentials secure and discreet while maintaining a clean outer appearance. It's ideal for travel or when you prefer a minimalist aesthetic.

# Choosing Your Perfect Leather Bum Bag

When selecting your leather bum bag, consider these points:

* Size Matters: Think about what you usually carry. Do you need just your phone and wallet, or do you require a bit more space for keys, lip balm, and other small essentials?
* Hardware Details: The buckles, zippers, and other metal accents can significantly impact the bag's overall look. Silver, gold, or gunmetal hardware can complement your personal style.
* Leather Finish: From smooth, polished leather to textured or pebbled finishes, each offers a unique aesthetic. Choose one that resonates with your taste and desired level of formality.
* Color Palette: While classic black and brown leather bum bags are always in style, consider venturing into rich jewel tones or earthy shades to add a pop of color to your wardrobe.

1. Caramel Macchiato: somewhere between Khamrah OG and Qahwa. I had expected it to be sweet, but it was more boozy and spicy. Definitely not a bad perfume, but not something ingenious either. So a little underwhelming. 3.8/5.

2. Eternal Coffee: just slightly less intense than Al Rehab French Coffee, but otherwise the same. Again, no sweetness at all. Pretty much black coffee, that's it. It's gonna be great for people who just want the coffee note, but I'm looking for something sweeter as well. 3/5

3. Green Tea: I just got this for the hype and had no expectation. But wow, this is so refreshing with just a hint of fruit. Perfect for summer, in my opinion. The dry down is sweet, but not overpowering. Might get a full size sometime in the future. 4.2/5.

4. Green Tea Tropical: amazing. Really sweet and fruity. But not as good as the OG, in my opinion. Just a little too sweet for my taste. 4/5.

I have more coming in haha and I gave into my impulse and got a full size of Khadlaj cafe latte, so well, let's hope that doesn't disappoint me haha! 😆😆",4,1753104025.0,desifemfrag,1,1.0,False
1m5ipfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1m5ipfq/my_parents_disappointed_me_on_my_graduation_day/,"My parents disappointed me on my graduation day, and now want me to apologize","
I graduated with distinction in the leading university of our country.

But that morning, my parents started yelling at me to get in the car even though I wasn’t fully dressed or ready. I hadn’t even combed my hair. We had already eaten at home (I cooked), but they insisted on going to a coffee shop. I didn’t eat anything there because I didn’t want to ruin my makeup or dress, and honestly, I was already emotionally shut down.

Because I was quiet, my mom called me ungrateful and said I should be thankful she even showed up. She also said she wanted to leave. That crushed me.

They still came to the ceremony, brought flowers, and posted congratulations on social media—but I wanted to be appreciated & congratulated in person. I didn't even get an apology on how they reacted earlier.

After the event, my mom wouldn't stop complaining about how long the ceremony took (5 hours), and that we had to arrive early—the event started an hour after we came. I didn't even get a congratulations from her, and she was yelling at my sister and father for different reasons. We ate dinner but she still didn't talk to me. I didn't want to initiate a conversation because I was waiting for an apology or congratulations from her.

Now they’re mad at me, even my father. They say I have “too high standards,” that “they’re just human,” and that I should be grateful they came at all. They want me to apologize for being upset. They told me they wouldn't change and that I could move out if I wanted to. 

They said I was too focused on my graduation day that they forgot everything else they've done for me. Most of the time they are good parents, but there are days when emotions overwhelm them. I understand this but I was really hoping for an apology. 

Whenever we have disagreements, I was usually the one to apologize to get it over with, but I just felt really hurt that they decided to act like this on my special day. They said I was too focused on the occasion and I get disappointed when they don't meet my expectations.

I don’t think I was expecting too much. I wasn’t asking for perfection. I just wanted to feel loved, celebrated, or at least like I mattered for a day. Instead, I felt like a burden. 

If you read this far, thank you. I needed to get this out.

1m5iojs,https://i.redd.it/k1kmj4gx98ef1.jpeg,Al Rehab Choco Musk - Dairy Milk in a Bottle 🍫,"Not sure if this is a clone of any high end designer but read a lot of good reviews when I initially joined the sub so decided to pull the trigger back then. 

When I initially got it, the chocolate smell was pretty synthetic and there was a distinct alcohol blast. It did settle down but took quite a while. I let it sit for a few months and my review will be based on what I smell today. 

The official note breakdown has notes like chocolate, vanilla, musk, spices, cinnamon, rose, sandalwood, etc. 

I still don’t get half the notes that are listed on fragrantica. What I got initially was just chocolate and vanilla after a synthetic alcohol blast but now it smells heavenly like a gourmand chocolate cake. The chocolate and vanilla notes blend so well make it smell almost like dairy milk chocolate. It definitely has a musky undertone which helps the fragrance perform and stay on your skin longer. 
 
As usual, I will breakdown the rest of the review into 5 parts;

1. PROJECTION: After maceration, the projection has gone up from 1-2 hours to 2-3 hours. It creates a nice chocolate bar bubble around you and people will definitely notice it. 

2. LONGEVITY:  Even longevity has gone up to about 3-4 hours on skin. Did a 8 hour sleep test and could still smell the chocolate on my Tshirt after waking up. 

3. PRICE: I bought this 50ml bottle from Deepak / Acordell in January 2025 for ₹555. Packaging and delivery times from Deepak were good as usual. No complaints there. I would say this is a very good entry point for people into gourmand fragrances. While you are not going to get a fragrances that develop and change every hour, the basic chocolate + milky vanilla works for a lot of people. Which makes it a relative safe blind buy. 

4. FINAL THOUGHTS: It still has a little alcohol blast when I spray it now after 6 months of owning it, but the synthetic-ness is completely gone. This is very good if you are on a budget and usually buy fragrances like wild stone, beardo and other Indian brands, as it’s in the same price range. I would say it’s still a good buy if you own other vanilla, leather, woody, strawberry, coffee based perfumes as this would layer pretty well with them. 

5. RATING: 6.5/10 - I’ve tried several gourmand fragrances that are very unique and better but of course they cost 5 times or even more of what this costs. From price perspective you get a lot of value for what you are paying. Chocolate + Vanilla is a very versatile unisex smell and can be used in a lot of scenarios, although it will shine in winters and cooler summer evenings. I usually wear this after applying chocolate cream and the result has always been amazing.

1m5im8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1m5im8h/filling_the_hole_left_by_mormonism/,Filling the hole left by Mormonism,"Firstly, I’ve been out of the church for good for around five years now. I was a TBM as a child and young teenager, and what kickstarted my exit was my extremely strict TBM parents. Another main thing was that I have chronic migraine (to be fair my parents did try to get me medical care) that was going untreated and dismissed by any Drs we found as I was “too young” to be having a condition that runs in the family… but I digress. The only thing that would mitigate the pain was lethal amounts of caffeine, but the energy drinks had so many additives they made my rebounds worse. So I started drinking coffee. My parents were actually chill about that bc they saw it as medicinal. Now I was convinced I was sinning but it was better than being in excruciating pain all the time. In an effort to find some clarity, i, as a history buff, started looking for historical events that might match up with the BOM because i thought it would give me context. All I found was that it was a bunch of BS. I won’t go too much into the the trauma I suffered in the church, but rather the grief that surrounded leaving it. (Btw my migraines are treated now lol)

When I found out the Book of Mormon was false and did not match history, I kind of felt like I was going to die. It genuinely was my entire world, my entire culture, religion, moral compass, family history and social circle, my relief from grief and loss and my hope for eternal life. Like every kind of heartbreak at once, I lost my friends and strained my relationship with my family, became isolated from my culture and circles, and lost everything I thought was true. I had invested so much time and faith only for it to come crashing down all around me. 

One day my prayers shifted from “please fix me” to “please help me survive this”.  I literally had to sit there and make peace with my own death because if the LDS afterlife isn’t real I didn’t have anything else to go on, but whether or not I know what’s after I’m still going to die one day. I had to re-grieve the people I’d lost. Truth felt subjective and I thought God himself didn’t love me because how could a loving God let me sit through all that abuse in His name because of a fake scripture and false prophet. 

So much guilt and shame and the loss of relationships had me genuinely considering ending it. When I had to reconstruct what was left of my morals and what I believed was right and wrong I had to start with what was legal because I genuinely couldn’t tell if premarital sex was a sin equal to murder (I am now in law school and actually used this as my personal statement). 

Then eventually every day got a little easier and I was able to form baseline ethics and make peace with objective reality. The shame is sill in the back of my mind though, like a schizophrenic voice telling me I’m unworthy. That’s actually probably why I hate misinformation so much and can’t bring myself to believe in things without evidence to back it up. 

I was 17 then but it’s interesting to see how my life has changed for the better without the church, even though I still have a lot of mental work to. I literally sometimes hear breakup songs and it sounds like my relationship with the church, because I really wanted to believe and I held on until I just couldn’t anymore. Like a love that was supposed to be eternal, that you sacrificed so much for, is suddenly gone 

Since then I’ve read every holy book from the major religions- the Tanakh, Quran, Bhagavad Gita, Dhammapada, etc and I’ve been to their temples, sat with monks and holy people, and I’ve just been searching everywhere for God but all I see is human nature. I do get a great amount of peace from visiting these places and from these texts, but i can’t believe any of it. The only one that makes sense to me is Buddhism because it’s more of a way of thinking than a religion, but even so I’m not sure. All I know now is that human suffering is real, and I would like to mitigate that for myself and others. 

I don’t have any specific questions but I want to see if anyone else has had similar thought processes or experiences, or found anything that kind of fills that hole (I’ve done the “fill the gap with alcohol” thing, don’t care to go back to that). I wouldn’t say I’m an atheist as of now, I think I’m leaning agnostic because I just can’t possibly know

Part 2","**The kitchen smells like tomato sauce and garlic by the time we reach it. The windows are fogged from the steam, and the light over the stove flickers with a slight buzz every now and then.**

**She’s got the pot boiling over slightly, muttering to herself as she stirs with one hand and pushes her sleeve up with the other. The other pot has the noodles inside with a lid over it.**

**“Sheesh,” she says, “I’ve got four cans of sauce in this thing, You’d think I was feeding a small army.”**

**“You** ***are*****,” Sam says from the doorway, peeking in like he’s afraid to get involved.**

**“Don’t come in here unless you’re planning on helping,” she snaps, but she’s smiling as she says it.**

**Jacob’s leaning against the counter nearby with an invisible spatula in hand, miming like he’s grilling. “Sorry, mom, y’know he’s never been as good as us at this stuff,” he says, flipping air. “Y’know, I’ve gotten really good at it the last two years. You should be proud of me over here.”**

**“Oh yeah?” Marcus asks, grabbing a cup from the cupboard. “You cook burgers for your  dead friends but not us?”**

**Jacob doesn't miss a beat. “Only medium-rare. Spirits like ‘em bloody.”**

**“God,” Kylie mutters, shaking her head with a smirk. “Someone take the ghost spatula away from him before I hit ‘em with a real one.”**

**“Don’t listen to her,” Jacob says, pointing to Kylie with his pretend spatula. “She’s just jealous the dead like my meat. Y’know, I’m sure there’s somebody here that wouldn’t mind yours!”**

**I step in then, grabbing a few bowls from the cupboard and laying them on the countertop. “*****Yupstilladumbass.*** **Can’t believe I missed this,” I mutter to no one in particular.**

**“What?” Kylie says without looking over to me on her left now.** 

**“Said I can’t believe I missed this,” I say. “Us. You yelling at everyone like a spaghetti warlord.”**

**She laughs and grinds her hip into mine for a moment too long. “Well, someone’s gotta keep you idiots fed.”**

**“Surprised you didn’t play into that one,” I say. “Spaghettnater? Carb queen?”**

**“Starch overlord,” Marcus throws in from the living room.**

**“Impasta,” Sam adds from behind his corner. “Hey,” He stretches it out, “why do they get to be in there?!”**

**Kylie groans. “Okay, you’re not getting any now. Is that what you want?”**

**“Goddddd, this is so not fair, I hate it here!” He feign stomps his shoes.** 

**“Noooo,” Liv calls from the hallway. “I’m starving, Sam, shut up before you make mom mad!”**

**Kylie stretches out a hand toward me. I grab it and shake. She sputters out a laugh and smacks it, then extends it again. I hand her a bowl, then start to turn.**

**“You’ve got some sauce,” she says.**

**“Huh?”**

**“Ope.”**

**She dabs a finger at the tip of my nose and wipes it clean, but doesn’t pull her hand away right away.**

**I blink. She’s closer than she needs to be. Her eyes dart between mine, just for a second.**

**Then she laughs, light and easy. “Messy eater, as usual.”**

**“Maybe you’re just a messy cook,” I say, quieter than I meant to.**

**From the other room, Marcus’s voice cuts through the warmth. “Hey! If you two are done reenacting a rom-com in there, some of us actually wanna eat!”**

**Kylie grabs one of the plastic bowls and chucks it blindly through the doorway.**

**“Eat up!”**

**“Yeah, eat up, bitch!” Jacob shouts, still pretending to grill. “Sheesh,” He wipes his forehead with a fake rag, “You never get used to the smell.”**

**Marcus yelps and ducks as the bowl smacks on the wall beside him.**

**“Hey, I paid good money for those bowls!”**

**“Yeah, like 10 years ago.” Sam quips.** 

**“Never heard of interest, pussy?”**

**“Never heard of pussy, pussy?”**

**“I just called you that, dumbass, I obviously know what it means.”**

**“Yeah, I forget your mom taught us all about that thang.”**

**“Aight.” Marcus stands up.**

**“Boys, settle it down in there!” Kylie shouts over. I shake my head while smiling.** 

**“God she sounds just like er’, doesn’t she?” Sam laughs, circling around the coffee table like a lineman.**

**“See, you always take shit too far man, now I gotta kill ya.”**

**“Easy boys, if anyone’s killing anybody it’s me, alright?” Jacob walks in and sits on the couch, placing a fake plate in front of him, “Now who wants cheese?”**

**“I think the bits dead, man..” Liz whispers, leaning closer to him and feigning like she’s grabbing a patty. He smiles toward her.**

**“I think YOU’RE dead, too.” He smiles. She chuckles, leaning into his shoulder.** 

**Kylie gives me a sidelong look and goes back to stirring.**

**I notice Noah sitting silently over on the armchair near the fireplace, looking out the window.**

**“Hey, Noah?” I walk over with a bowl of spaghetti and a fork. He’s still staring when I nudge him by the shoulder. He looks toward me with a scowl, but I hand him the bowl. “Hang out, man.”** 

**“Eh, I was just-”**

**“Sure, no problem.” Marcus smiles, grabbing the chair by the arms and walking it over, grinding against the floor a bit. Noah sighs, gripping the bowl as he finally gets placed just at the coffee table. Marcus pats his shoulder before heading toward the counter next to me, both waiting for Kylie to give the word.** 

**The couch dips under the weight of Sam as he plops down beside Jacob, twirling his fork through a noodle pile. Malcolm drops next to her, already halfway into his bowl, groaning like it’s the best thing he’s ever eaten.**

**“Oh my god,” he says, mouth full. “You can be a bitch sometimes, but this shit is good!”**

**“It’s literally canned sauce and box noodles,” Kylie says, wiping her hands on a dishtowel.**

**“Yeah,” he says, shoveling more in. “And it slaps. Why don’t you cook like this back home?”**

**She rolls her eyes, but I see the faint pink at her cheeks as she finally sits down across from me, bowl in hand. I’ve got my own steaming heap of pasta and a cold drink in my hand. Non-alcoholic, for now. The warmth in my chest isn’t from the drink anyway.** 

**“So,” Jacob says, leaning back a bit. “What’s everyone been up to the last two years, huh? It was pretty boring for me, so..?”**

**“I joined a running group,” Liv offers, almost too quiet to hear.**

**Marcus raises an eyebrow. “Like, with people?”**

**She nods, sheepish.**

**“This is the first time I’m hearing about this? Liv, what the hell?”**

**“You-seemed busy?” She sounds like she’s asking herself more than him.**

**“BUSY?! I go to the gym every day, why didn’t you ever ask to run with me?”**

**“Good for you, Liz,” I say. “He’d just slow you down.”**

**“Nah, see, now I gott-”**

**“I read,” Kylie says proudly. “Like, I joined a book club, I mean.”**

**“Book club?” Jacob asks, pointing his fork at her. “That’s called being a nerd.”**

**“Big words for a dead guy.” she shoots back.**

**We all laugh. Even Noah huffs something close to one.**

**Jacob looks around at us, his smile wide-but this time, it feels real. “It’s good to see everyone laughing again,” he says, quieter. “I like the way it feels.”**

**There’s a brief silence.** 

**Kylie glances at me again as she scoots a little closer. “You doing okay?” she asks softly, her voice barely above the hum of the fireplace.**

**“Yeah,” I say, then quickly add, “Well, no, but I'm better now.”**

**She smiles and leans forward to grab a napkin, but instead dabs a bit of sauce on the tip of my nose again.**

**“Still messy,” she says, grinning.**

**“Still annoying,” I fire back, grinning wider.**

**“Ohhh my** ***goddd*****,” Marcus groans. “Can you two stop flirting for five minutes? You’ve been single for two years, at least save it for back home.”**

**“I’m not flirting, dick.” I say.**

**“I’m just feeding my child,” Kylie adds, sticking her tongue out at me.**

**“Well then feed me too, mommy!” Sam says.**

**Kylie blinks. “Nope. Done with that.”**

**The room erupts into laughter again.**

**I eventually find myself sitting at the bar with Jacob, the others all scattered about talking. I stare into my bowl, shooting glimpses in his direction every now and then.** 

**“You got something you wanna say, dude?” He smiles, turning my way, “Or maybe..nah, Kylie wouldn’t like that.” I shake my head with a smile. “Out with it, dude.”**

**“I just..” I can’t help but see flashes of that night. What was left of his body being carried away in the trucks. “I shouldn’t have left you.. That night. You needed me, but I left you at that river.”**

**“Ah.” He smiles, scooting a bit closer, “If i’m not mistaken, I asked you to give me some space, no?”**

**“That doesn’t matter, man. You were obviously going through something, I should’ve stuck with you. Instead-”**

**“You did what your friend asked you to? You respected my space? Yeah, you’re a real monster..”**

**I sigh, leaning more toward my bowl.** 

**“Look, there’s no point in thinking about it, alright? Cause I'm here now!” He pats my back.**

**“How? How are you here?”**

**“Well, I drove my truck-”**

**“We saw your body, man.”**

**He looks toward the group with a sigh. “Yeah, I was there.”** 

**“Then, what happened? You were gone. You’re not supposed to be here.”**

**He turns back to me, “Is anyone ever where they’re supposed to be?”**

**My eyes narrow,  “Don’t give me that bullshit, man. I’m glad you’re here, seriously. But I gotta know..”**

**For some reason, he grins, “What if I’m not actually me, huh? What if I’m just your conscience? Your guilt. Your regret. Your wish that I was really here.”**

**“Just tell me, man.”**

**“Look..” He settles back in the seat, “I don’t really remember much. I remember darkness. It was.. Heavy. Kinda wet, not in the good way, mind you. Like I was underwater. Then I could feel my body, some burning in my chest. There was dirt everywhere. In my mouth, under my nails. Then I was back on the surface, my clothes were ripped up, so the first thing I did was go back home.”**

**“You.. clawed out of the casket? After two years?”**

**“Do you believe in… echoes? Like, a version of us that keeps walking even after we’re gone?”**

**“I don’t understand..”**

**“I think that’s how I’m here now. Like, some memory of myself broke me out of my casket, fed me my body. Put itself inside and gave me control.”**

**“You’re not making any sense, man.”**

**“Nothing about dying makes sense. Is it so wrong? Me being here?”**

**“What? No, I’m glad you’re back, man, it’s just.. I don’t know..”**

**“Yeah, I get it dude. But, you wanna know something funny?”**

**“..what’s that?”**

**“After all this time, I feel more alive now than I ever did before.”**

**“That’s good, I guess? But there’s something I don’t get.. Well, a lot, I guess.”**

**“What’s that?”**

**“When Sam asked you back at home. You said the first thing you remembered was waking up on the side of the road?”**

**“I.. I did, heh..” He jerks his neck to the side. “I really didn’t-”**

***click.***

**Everything goes black.**

**The lights all snap off. The room plunges into darkness, save for the orange glow of the fireplace.**

**No one says anything at first.**

**Just forks pausing. The sound of rain suddenly louder against the roof. When did it start raining?**

**“Uh…” Sam’s voice breaks the silence. “Anyone know where the breaker is?”**

**Kylie slowly lowers her fork. “Jacob, if this is a bit-”**

**“It’s not,” he says, standing up from his stool. “I’ve literally been here the whole time.”**

**“Power’s out,” Marcus says, already rising to head toward the hallway. “I’ll check the box.”**

**“It’s outside.” I offer.**

**He nods, grabbing his phone for a flashlight.**

**“You coming?” he asks.**

**I hesitate.** 

**But then I nod.**

**“Yeah,” I say, standing slowly. “Yeah, I’m coming.. I guess.”**

**I dust my legs off, setting the bowl on the counter and following suit toward the front door.** 

**“Don’t get lost..” Kylie smiles from the coffee table.**

**“It’s literally up against the house.”**

**“Last time somebody-”**

**“Enough.” Jacob claps, digging back into his food. “We could always sit around the fire telling ghost stories if you’re too scared?”**

**“Yeah, I don’t think ghost stories would be a good idea for this group.” Liz chimes in.**

**“Oh, I don’t know, ghosts can be pretty fun!”**

**I shake my tremoring hands at my sides as I reach Marcus. He takes a step outside, I close the door behind us. Luckily the front porch has an overhead, so the rain doesn’t drench us right away.**

**“Probably should’ve brought some rain coats, huh?” I ask as we look around the side.** 

**“Heh, I guess. Didn’t say anything about rain today.”**

**“Didn’t really have to, it was pretty cloudy this morning..”**

**He takes a few quick breaths. “Alright, it’s just over there. Just hold the light and I’ll reset the main fuse, then we can run back.”**

**“On your mark, Captain.”**

**We jog across the gravel, hopping over the side of the porch, shoes crunching into the wet mud beneath us. Marcus’s flashlight cuts through the dark, bouncing shadows off the trees and the warped siding of the cabin. The air smells like wet pine needles and soil. I taste metal in my throat again, but it’s probably just adrenaline. Or the actual rain water dripping between my lips.**

**The breaker box is exactly where I remembered—nestled against the back wall under a crooked awning, rust creeping along its edges. Marcus kneels down, pops it open with a groan as I hold the light, my other arm covering my head.** 

**“Jesus,” he mutters. “This thing’s fucked.”**

**“Still works though, right?” There are dents across most of the switches, some are even missing. Honestly I have no clue how we had power to begin with.**

**He clicks a few switches, then flips the main.**

**Nothing happens.**

**“Well?” I ask.**

**“Try the door. See if the porch light comes back on.”**

**“Here.” I hand him the phone before doubling back around the house, sticking one arm out to shield myself from the rain now creeping under the eaves. I glance up at the corner of the cabin. Porch light’s dead.**

**“Nope!” I call.**

**“What?!” He yells back.**

**“I said no!”**

**Marcus sighs. “Alright, gimme a sec.”**

**He flips the breakers off again, then back on. Still nothing. He taps the metal box, shakes it once for good measure, then stands.**

**“How about now?!”** 

**“Nah, still nothing.”**

**“Think it’s the whole area?”**

**“Could be,” I say. “Or just this old-ass cabin.”**

**He heads back toward the porch, shoes squelching in wet leaves.**

**Then the porch light flickers once. Then again. Still dead.**

**Marcus looks at me. “Alright, yeah. Let’s just get back inside.”**

**We shoulder the door open to a chorus of voices, the warm flicker of the fireplace still the only light.**

**“Any luck?” Kylie asks, leaning over the back of the couch.**

**“Nope,” Marcus says, brushing water from his jacket. “Could be the lines. Maybe a transformer got hit somewhere.”**

**“I don’t know, the panels were pretty fucked..”**

**“Yeah, I honestly don’t know how we had power to begin with.”**

**“Wait..” I look at the group finally, “Where’s Liz?”**

**“Yeah, wait, Jacobs-”**

**“Easy fellas, they’re just in the bathroom.” Kylie smiles. They’re all sitting closer to the fire now. Noah watches the flames bounce closer than the rest.** 

**“Together?” I ask.** 

**“I think they’re just in the bathroom,” Kylie repeats, pulling her blanket tighter. “Jacob offered to hold a light for her since it’s dark.”**

**A beat passes.**

**Another.**

**The fire crackles and spits a soft pop.**

**Sam glances toward the hallway. “Uh… it’s been a minute though, hasn’t it?”**

**Marcus shifts on the armrest of the couch. “Maybe they’re hooking up. Cabin fever, y’know? Creepy darkness, long-lost friends. Some real pent-up emotion stuff.”**

**“Oh, come on,” Kylie groans.**

**“No, no, I’m serious.” Marcus raises his hands innocently. “I’m just saying, dude’s been laying it on pretty thick..”**

**A few more moments pass. The fire dims slightly as a log crumbles inward. Still no sign of Jacob or Liz. Marcus and I carried the couch toward the fire by now. Kylie and I are laid up with the quilt, Marcus and Sam on the other end, with Noah still sitting on his damn chair.** 

**“Alright..” Sam jolts up, walking over to squint down the hallway. “Yo!” he calls out, cupping his hands around his mouth. “Liz? Jacob? You two done making out back there? We’re getting cold** ***and*** **suspicious!”**

**No answer.**

**Just the wind and rain picking up outside.**

**“Uh.. hello?!”** 

**“Jesus, calm down, dude!” The light flicks through the hall, Jacob finally making his way back with the girl. She wraps herself on his shoulder. Not looking up to Sam. Probably embarrassed.** 

**“Took your time, huh?!” Sam accuses.** 

**“Oh, stop bein’ jealous!” Noah bites out, trying to grin as we all look over.** 

**Jacob shrugs like he’s unfazed, but the way Liz avoids eye contact says enough. Her arms are crossed now, hair tucked forward like a curtain. She murmurs something no one hears and disappears back toward the far hallway.**

**“So you can handle being alone?!” Sam calls out. Most of us chuckle.**

**Kylie leans against me a little more under the quilt, the heat between us warm enough to fight off the fire’s dimming light. She yawns-real or not, I can’t tell-and stretches her arms overhead before letting them flop into her lap.**

**“Alright,” she says, almost lazily, “I’m gonna go ahead and crash before one of you starts snoring.”**

**Sam raises his hands as he flops back onto the couch, “You’re literally the loudest snorer here, but whatever.”**

**“Like a damn lawnmower.” Marcus adds.**

**Kylie smirks, brushing the quilt off her legs and standing. She looks toward me for a second longer than she needs to. “You coming?”**

**My mouth opens. Closes. Then I nod. “Yeah,” I say. “Guess I am pretty tired.”**

**“Jesus, is everybody getting laid tonight?!” Sam cries out.** 

**“Heh, play your cards right, big boy..” Marcus chuckles.**

**“Shit, we’d have this whole cabin shakin’.”**

**“Hell yeah we would.” The two fist bump, Marcus starting to eat a second bowl.** 

**“Nobody is getting laid… I’m just goin’ to bed.” Kylie smiles and heads off toward the hallway, slow steps, quiet. I linger a moment by the fire with the others still bickering in the background. Something about pillows and property rights.** 

**I stand, muttering a “Night” to the room, and follow her shadow down the hall.**

**“I’d stay out of the bathroom if I were you!” Jacob laughs toward me, “That spaghetti really fucked her up!”**

**“Gross, dude..” Sam mumbles.**

**“Just sayin’ man, it’s gonna wreak.”**

**The cabin is darker than before. Colder too, with the warmth of the fire already thinning behind me. My nose twitches as I pass the bathroom. The door to my room’s already cracked slightly. Just enough to see soft light from a phone inside. I push it open slowly.** 

**She’s here.**

**Sitting on the bed, one knee pulled up, her hoodie off and resting in a bundle on the floor beside her. Bare shoulders catching the light. Just her tank top now. She’s not looking at me, just picking at a loose thread on the blanket like it’s the only thing in the room. Kylie is sitting on my bed. Kylie is sitting on my bed. My body is very warm.**

**Then she glances up, meets my eyes.**

**There’s a stillness in the air. One that feels like we’re balancing on the edge of something neither of us meant to say out loud.**

**Her lips tug into a faint smile.**

**“Took your time, huh?” she asks coolly.** 

**I linger in the doorway, one hand on the frame, like I’m waiting for some sign this isn’t a bad idea. But there’s nothing in her face. She isn’t just teasing me, not this time.**

**I close the door behind me.**

**“You warm enough?” I ask, immediately regretting how dumb it sounds.**

**She chuckles softly. “Yeah, Johnny. I’m good.” Then, after a beat, “You can sit down, y’know.”**

**I nod, stepping over and easing onto the edge of the bed. There’s a breath of silence between us, filled only by the distant crackle of the fire and the soft drumming of rain on the roof.**

**“I missed you,” She says quietly.**

**I lean back on my palms, eyes on the ceiling. “Yeah,” I murmur. “Me too.”**

**A pause.**

**Then she reaches out, her fingers brushing the back of my hand. Light. Barely there.**

**“You always tremble like this?” she asks, softer now.**

**I look down, see the shake in my hands, try to clench them still.**

**“I’m tired,” I say. It’s not the whole truth, but it’s enough for now.**

**Her fingers thread between mine.**

**“Hopefully not too tired..”**

**The quiet wraps tighter. My chest pulls in a breath that doesn’t want to leave. When I look at her again, she’s already close—closer than she was a second ago, like the space between us never really mattered.**

**When she kisses me, it’s slow. Warm. Familiar in a way that makes my heart ache.**

**I don’t rush it. Neither does she.**

**There’s no desperation. No big declarations. Just the weight of years, grief, comfort. Her arms around my neck. My hands finding her waist. Clothes pulled aside in lazy movements, like neither of us are sure what we’re doing until we’re already doing it.**

**She presses her forehead to mine at one point, whispering, “You’re okay. I’ve got you. I’m not letting you go again.” her finger linger on my lower half, dipping under my briefs.**

**Later, we’re tangled up under the old quilt. The rain’s louder now, and the fire in the other room must be dying. But here, everything is still.**

**She lies against me, one arm draped over my chest. Her breasts resting on my body and her breathing slow.**

**“You asleep?” I ask, my voice barely a murmur.**

**“Nah,” she whispers back.**

**Another pause.**

**“He’s really back, huh?” I ask. I don’t have to say the name.**

**She shifts a little, her hand finding mine under the covers.**

**“I guess so,” she says. “I don’t wanna be alone tonight.”**

**I squeeze her hand. “Yeah. Me neither.”**

**“Y’know, I missed this.”**

**“Yeah. Me too.”**

**She leans over on her shoulder, looking into my eyes. “So, what is this?”**

**“This?” I ask, playing with her hair.**

**“Yeah. Look, It’s been two years, so if you’re not interested anymore-”**

**“I put my hand on her chin, “I’m definitely still interested.”**

**The warmth of her against me makes it hard to move. But eventually, the dull pull in my gut reminds me I should’ve gone before bed.**

**“I’ll be right back,” I whisper, brushing her hair back gently.**

**She murmurs something about hurrying and stays nestled against the pillow.**

**I pull on my shirt, slip out from under the quilt as quietly as I can, and tiptoe toward the door.**

**“You want me to go with you?” She leans up.** 

**“Heh, nah, I think I can handle it. Thanks though.”**

**“I could hold it for you..”**  

**“You-what?”**

**She chuckles, “The light, dummy.”**

**“Oh, heh, no, I think I got it.” I turn and slowly open the door up.**

**“Though I wouldn’t mind doing that at some point..” She mumbles,**

**The creak of the floorboards under my feet sounds louder than it should as I step into the hall.** 

**The firelight from the living room barely reaches this far. I don’t bother with my phone. I know the layout. Grew up in this place every summer. Every hallway, every corner, every door. It’s all muscle memory by now.**

**I push open the bathroom door.**

**The instant it swings wide, I freeze at the smell. “Sheesh, Liz..” I mumble under my breath, “You really weren’t-”**

**Liz’s eyes meet mine, except they’re nearly crossed.**

**“Huh?”**

# Multiply by Zero

**Classification**: Supernatural Powers, Reality Manipulation, Math-Based Powers, Physics-Based Powers, Erasure Powers,

**Type**: Thought-Based

**Energy Consumption**: None

**Threat Level**: 1?

**Summary**:

A small ability that Saiki discovered when ‘’‘’‘ accidentally’“”‘’ moved the solar system from its orbit. This ability, like in mathematics, allows Saiki to multiply any aspect of reality by zero and make it disappear from reality!

No sequels! .... maybe....?

* One tiny problem is that once deleted, it cannot be restored unless an indeterminacy is created. But that would cause the universe to collapse. Again.
* The reason Saiki moved the solar system has to do with coffee jelly.

My Experience with New Tools Like Jolii,"Hello everyone! Probably the best possible way to learn a language is living where it’s spoken and hearing it, seeing it, and using it every day. But unfortunately full immersion is not always an option.., However, I have the feeling that no living in the place cannot be an excuse and keep me from language learning. I have tried some of the new tools and Apps which use AI and I think immersion today is NEARLY possible.  So here are my ways to practice languages as effectively as possible, with and without AI!

* Coffee Break Languages:  short, interesting podcasts. I usually listen to them while in my car or doing chores at home
* [Jolii.ai](http://Jolii.ai) : the best mix of watching real videos and learning from them with AI. I can save words, review them and test myself with quizzes based on the videos I’ve actually watched. I can also import my own videos.
* Tandem: that’s where I can find native speakers to chat or even call. This is challenging at times, but I do get to do real speaking practice. 

Have you also tried AI? Which tools are you using to immerse in the language with living in the country where it is spoken?

I (F28) got kicked out of a friendgroup. And i just want to get some opinions, if I was the problem.

The group consisted of couple lets call them Tara and Greg (F26/M28), 2 guys Tom and Mike (21&28) and me. I got into this group because of Tara.

So - i've been a part of group for about 2 1/2 years. We met up regualrly for game night. And everything was really good. I got along with everyone.

Anyway, i am a very open and friendly type of person. I can come off strong in my openenss, so it has always been the case of either you like me or you dont.

Since i love getting to know people, i usally meet up with everyone of them for coffee.

Me and Tara got along very well. Throughout the 2 years everything was fine. A few bumps here and there but nothing big.

Tara came to me with concerns about me and my personality. She told me that she never met someone as open as me and how i my way of being is unusual to her.  
She didnt mean it in a bad way, but something was off. We talked about everything and all was good. I thought.

So as i said, i also met up with her partner Greg for coffee twice. All normal things nothing unusual. Tara knew about both meetings and was fine with it. I thought,

About 2 weeks ago i got this text:

*Hey,*

*I thought long and hard about whether I wanted to have this conversation in person. I've come to the conclusion that I don't want to because I know that I won't be able to say exactly what I want to say.*

*First of all: it will be a goodbye. It is planned as a monologue. I don't want to talk about what happened or how we can improve our relationship, because we've done that often enough and it hasn't had any effect.*

*I'm sure this won't come as a surprise to you, or maybe you don't want to admit it because you know what it means: you're no longer part of the group.*

*I don't know what's going on, but I don't want to keep puzzling over it and chasing after you either. By now it's obvious that you have a problem with me, but you just won't talk about it. It was very noticeable in the group chat the other day and it was the final straw for me.*

*I've been hurt for months and have the feeling that you're distancing yourself from me more and more. But since you don't want to talk to me about it, even though the possibilities were endless, it's too late now.*

*I spoke to everyone in the group and explained my feelings to them. I didn't badmouth you, because that wasn't my point -  of course you can still keep in touch with everyone if you want to. It's just that it won't work with the group anymore, because there's something between us and it's obviously not going to be resolved.*

*This “friendship”, although it hasn't been that for me recently, gives me nothing but stress and constant thoughts about what I'm doing wrong or can do better - without even knowing what's wrong.*

*As I said, I've spoken to everyone, including Greg. In our conversation, I explained to him that I wouldn't feel comfortable if you continued to have contact and he took that decision into account. Your behavior towards Greg has become too much for me. 80% of our conversations are just about him (why?!) and i find the things you talk about with him (e.g. that he needs another female go-to-person and you want to be that for him) strange. You've known each other for a long time, but still not really well, and whatever it is that makes you say that, I thik crosses a line. I also get the feeling that you're always highlighting him and that he's something of a trophy for you that you can win, and I really don't have the nerve for that kind of competition.*

*Nevertheless, I wish you all the best for the rest of your life. It didn't work out between us, that's how life is sometimes. We had a pretty good time at the beginning, but unfortunately it's the opposite now.*

*Please let my words go through your head, think about them actively and maybe you can understand them. But if not, that's okay too. I wish to not getting an answer, because for me everything has been said - we've tried to talk to each other often enough. If you still want to say something, I can't stop you - but please don't make any justifications, explanations, accusations or anything to smooth things over.*

*I'm not saying all this to criticize you as a person or to make you feel bad. I just want you to understand that your behavior towards me has now led to this decision.*

*Take care.*

Just to give y'all some context. I am happily enganged and am with my fiance for 6 1/2 years now. They've been a couple for like 9 years.

And i am always big on communication. So, **IF** theres anything i usually talk about it.  
As y'all can take away from the text - she thought i had an issue with her, which i, in her opinion never spoke of.

We talked 2-3 times about things and i thought that those convos cleared up her issues and insecurities.

Also i have no idea what she meant with our convos being 80% about Greg and that i crossed a boundary. When i met Greg for coffe the second time, we talked about my wedding plans. Like Venue, what Season etc.

Of couse i talked with him about how he would propose to Tara and what he could imagine. And in that sense i offered to be the go-to-person for that. Tbh i mainly thought about Tara when i said that.  
I mean its never bad to have a second opinion from a female regarding wedding or something i thought. I never intended to replace Tara by saying that.

I mean both could have told be that i crossed a line. But they never did.

Of couse. I was baffled. Shes complaining about me, apparently having a problem with her where i wont talk to her about it, But being hurt for MONTHS because of my action or lack therof - and NOT talking to me?

And y'all I DIDN'T and still DON'T have a problem with her.

I was confused, hurt and pretty pissed that she somewhat accused me of trying to steal her boyfriend.

Havent talked to her since. 

So yeah. Am i the problem? ",2,1753102584.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I’m originally from China, of a race that has been persecuted for years. Long story short, I fled a few years ago and now live happily here. I’ve got a decent job and rarely think about the things I witnessed back then. (Forgive me for not being brave enough to share all the details)

A certain party and its agenda (yes, the orange one) has been painfully triggering for me. It sounds extremely similar to what I was taught in boarding school: love your country, cherish your values, blah blah. One day I was riding my bike past one of their campaign sites, and a guy there wearing orange shirt gave me a look I know too well.

I keep telling myself Japan is not China—it’s still a constitutional democracy with checks and balances. But I just can’t suppress the anxiety. I tried to touch some grass but it didn’t help. It just didn’t feel right, knowing that millions of ordinary people voted for a party that echoes ideas with CCP.

He came to my job because our companies cooperated from time to time. He visited like once a month or something. He always looked at me, stared at me. Even asked my boss about my relationship status. Sometimes he came up to me for a chat. I knew he was interested, however, I was in a relationship at a time. My partner died one year ago from addiction and I have been single since.

So this guy stopped visiting us, and I randomly just thought about him like 3 weeks ago.  
I got his number, and called him to ask about something credit score related since he works in finance industry.  
We chatted, he asked about my love life, I told him I'm single since my partner died, he told me he is getting divorced, but spending time with his son (12 years old) and that he will be in my town so we can meet.

It was a light, sweet conversation, obviously there was some sort of attraction on both ends, he seemed kinda shy.

I called him last Monday around 8 PM to ask about his weekend, he called me on Tuesday, we chatted again, about his work, his plans with his son. He told me to go and get a grab a coffee with just the two of us on Sunday(yesterday) since I mentioned I have a birthday. I told him that of course, I want to meet him, I'm open. He told me he wants to see me too.

He told me he has to go because he has a meeting at work. Then he texted me saying that he ""got shy"" and that he got nervous. I told him it's ok. He asked me if I'm seeing anyone recently, because he doesn't want to be inappriopriate. I told him I'm single, that I want to get to know him better.

On the same day, he calls me around 8 PM, he's outside of some restaurant with the coworkers on the lunch. We talk for 1 hour. He says he is ""crazy over me"", that he finds me very attractive, that he was always asking my boss about me, asked for my number. He told me if I'm open to travel with him for 3 days somewhere with my dog?(I have a sweet shihtzu) I say of course I would love that. He then proceeds to tell me ""Do we have to wait til Sunday? I have a hotel booked til Thursday,but I can leave earlier."" I told him that we can meet earlier of course. He told me we can meet tommorow (Wednesday), that he will stay in a hotel, we will go to a dinner.

The conversation went very smooth and we really had a good vibe with each other. We never had a chance to talk for so long, or get to know each other better, so I thought its a good opportunity. He also stated that he thinks about me. He brought up some details from the past - he told me which jeans I wore when he visited our office, or which shoes I wore. Also he told me I once got into some black car and drove off and that he drove behind me but he couldn't find me. (I don't remember that, I didn't know about that).Those little details seemed cute to me. It was like he still remembered. Like those moments from few years ago when we looked at each other were still alive. Illusion, but alive, maybe. Also he texted to me about his age, about the fact that he's not looking for ""fun"" to make this clear, when we talked he spoke about not going for prostitutes or sidechicks, that he is profesional at work considering his work status and stuff.

This conversation took place on Tuesday. On Wednesday, I texted him to confirm the meeting. The message was marked as green, no iMessage sent. I thought he is in a train and out of signal.  
The phone was ""out of signal"" for the whole day. I think this phone number is his private, from what I know. I was surprised.

Thursday, phone out of signal again.

Friday, out of signal. I call him from different number and he picks up after some time. Tells me he has a ""huge accident in his house and that he will call me later, also asks if we can meet'. Doesn't call me again.

Saturday. He calls me by mistake (on my second number, he didn't save it) saying that he is ""standing under number 20"" (I think he meant the door number or apartment number) I say which 20??? what???? and he tells me - Oh my god, I'm sorry.

Hangs up. His phone is out of signal/ out of reach for majority of the days. Sometimes he turns the phone on again so there is a signal but for short period of time.

Sunday. Phone was turned off for the whole day.

I know that none of you knows WHY he's doing what he's doing. But he seemed genuinely interested in me. He really seemed honest and shy about conversation and stuff.

Also, I think thats the big factor in understanding the story - he once visited our company (3 years ago) while being ...under some sort of substance to say at least. Also I found his tiktok account (no videos) and a lot of accounts about drug recovery are being followed by him.

I don't know if he's clean. I know nothing about it. We didn't talk about it. This might be his past but I just think it's worth mentioning. He also told me he is attending therapy because he used to have depression due to divorce.

I know y'all will say to stay away from him, but I genuinely don't know why is he ghosting me like this.  
I think the reasons might be:  
\- he is on a bender and doesn't know what's going on  
\- he knows he is an addict and ""doesnt want to hurt me""  
\- or he is clean from any substances and the reasons is unknown to me still  
Also when I told him I asked someone for his number, he told me that he was happy to give his number to this person to give it to me, and even if I didnt call him, he would ask for mine.

I had birthday yesterday and I wasnt even present or happy with my family because this situation made me feel so sad. I was so hopeful that we will spend time together.

I consider that he might be having a hard time right now. And it was weird, that he picked up the phone after ghosting and quickly said ""I have huge accident, can we meet? I will call back"". I don't know what is he going through right now. But we talked around 6pm and next day around 11AM the phone was already turned off. Why? he knew I was interested. He told me he's happy that I'm so open for communication, that we can talk about a lot.

And before y'all judge me...I was just genuinely happy.I felt like a 15 year old. Damn, I even hopped in my car immediately after this conversation and drove 40 km in the rain to my friend to borrow shoes, dresses. We picked up the perfume. We were giggling and laughing and then I drove in the rain home. The roads were the same but everything felt so different. Like my world has changed. Suddenly, I saw me and him. I saw myself safe in his arms. I drove and imagined him sitting beside me in the car. I pictured how our conversations could be. Then, I fell asleep, dizzy from overwhelming scent of 3 different perfumes I sprayed on myself to choose which was the best for a date.

I felt happy for a new beginning. I'm just a lover girl and I'm learning the hard way. Again...

This is a bit of a vulnerable share, but one I am open with sharing with people who I assume are judgement free.

My first morning living by “the rules”, I woke up at 6am, did yoga, meditated, drank one cup of coffee (going to try to stop drinking caffeine, but if I quit cold turkey I’d get a headache). I re-read more of BHN. Very excited. 

Admittedly it was tough to get myself motivated at 6am but I felt great about it after I did. 

While walking my dog I noticed that I was having thoughts of feeding my ego. I became obsessed with the idea of writing a book (mostly unrelated book) and “oh my book with be so much better when I can get up on stage as an enlightened being and talk about it” “think of all the people I’ll know, all the girls I will impress, etc etc”

I want to make it clear: my intentions are pure. I was recently hospitalized for mental health reasons and i feel like everything has came to me at the perfect moment. It is time for me to go on this journey for myself and other beings.

1m5hyuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1m5hyuy/long_term_suffering_advice_needed/,"Long term suffering, advice needed.","Hi all,

Until mid-2021, I was a healthy and active guy in my late 20s. After a flu-like illness, my doctor prescribed Amoxicillin. The cough cleared, but then I crashed badly. I started experiencing severe fatigue, brain fog, muscle pain, headaches, and non-refreshing sleep. Alongside that, many smaller problems appeared in my body.

All my lab tests and scans have been normal. If anyone is interested, you can read the full story here:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1hy3a46/my\_journey\_with\_chronic\_fatigue\_brain\_fog\_muscle/](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1hy3a46/my_journey_with_chronic_fatigue_brain_fog_muscle/)

I’m starting to suspect candida might be involved for a few reasons, but I’d like your opinion:

* I took Amoxicillin.
* Since mid-2021, my stool has been inconsistent, usually very watery and never solid like before.
* I had a long period of extreme bloating.
* If I fast for 24 to 48 hours, I feel better, but as soon as I eat something, I crash hard with extreme fatigue and headaches.
* My symptoms vary, but I consistently feel like I’m completely poisoned.
* Since 2021, I have had athlete’s foot on one foot and one toenail. It doesn’t spread, but it is very stubborn. I tried itraconazole pills and various terbinafine creams. These treatments make it go away temporarily, but it always comes back. At some point, it stops growing and never spreads further.

I’m unsure if candida is the cause because itraconazole is used to treat candida, but after two months of taking it, I didn’t feel any better.

I’ve looked through this sub for advice but would really appreciate your thoughts.

Some more background about me:

* I don’t eat junk food or fast food, and have been eating healthy home-cooked meals for years.
* I’ve tried various diets, but a mixed approach works best for me. Keto gives me uncontrollable diarrhea.
* I don’t drink alcohol or soda, just water, tea, and one coffee in the morning.
* I drink kefir regularly and make my own Reuteri yogurt.

Currently, I take:

* Magnesium
* NAC with glycine
* Turmeric with black pepper
* Lacto and bifido probiotics
* Vitamin C
* 200 mg of B2
* 1000 mg of thiamine HCL (B1)

Despite all this, I’m still not feeling better. Should I consider adding something like NOW Candida Support or Nystatin from Germany? Are there any risks associated with Nystatin?

I'm sorry for the long read, i've been suffering for a long time and i'm looking for answers. I hope some of you can share some wisdom, even if it is not candida related. ",1,1753102014.0,Candida,6,1.0,False

• Week 1️⃣: I was jittery and manic, it tapered off by the end of the week. Headaches and trouble sleeping, solved with ibuprofen & mg of melatonin + magnesium glycinate at night. 

• Week 2️⃣: Headaches persist, but now I’m getting sleepy after I take my Prozac. Super sedated feeling as I was hitting a serotonin boost. I needed naps after taking my pill, and decided to give up caffeine because it would just make me super anxious. Still taking ibuprofen for headaches and melatonin + magnesium glycinate for sleep. I decided not to switch taking my Prozac at night, because I didn’t want to eventually have a problem with sleep. Just allowed myself the space to feel comfortable with being a bit emotionally blunted, bored and sleepy. 

• Week 3️⃣: I stared getting a bit more anxious here, was a bit nervous about random things, but the sedation and sleepiness started decreasing. I no longer needed naps, and was sleeping better at night. Making sure I was hitting a minimum of 7k steps per day helped with both the anxiety and sleep. Still taking ibuprofen but my headaches stayed to go away, and of course melatonin and magnesium glycinate— which has just become part of my daily routine at this point. 

• Week 4️⃣: The sedation and sleepiness has worn off completely, I feel normal. I do drink my coffee at least 90 min before or after taking my Prozac, and make sure to drink lots of water, get my steps in, and lift weights 3x per week. Prior to taking Prozac I had an extremely hard time getting myself motivated to go to the gym, I notice that now I enjoy it and look forward to it. My mood is so much more stable, and even though I’m still having a few intrusive thoughts— I can recognize them and tell them to fuck right off. 

If you’re in the beginning of your journey— stick with it. So far I am really happy I started and didn’t give up. Give yourself the grace to change, and I promise you will. If you reach the end of 6 weeks and still don’t feel a difference— talk to your doctor. 

Negative side effects for me have included 
• decreased libido, but it’s coming back slowly 
• emotional numbness, also wearing off 
• a bit more sweaty, managed with better deodorant 
• caffeine sensitivity, I’ve just stopped drinking as much 

Hope this helped! Best of luck on your journey. ",3,1753101411.0,prozac,3,1.0,False

1m5hr0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m5hr0w/so_i_recently_learned_a_horrifying_truth_about_my/,So... I recently learned a horrifying truth about my girlfriend.,"So... I recently learned a horrifying truth about my girlfriend. She’s coming home in a few hours or so, and I don’t know what the hell to do about it.

She’s—she’s not human.

I don’t know what she is, exactly. Don’t get me wrong, she *looks* human. Tan skin, gorgeous red hair, legs for days and a smile that makes me forget my own damn name. I’ve spent countless nights with her, under her, beside her, tangled up in each other like we were made to fit. But there’s always been something… off.

At first, I thought I’d just lucked out. She always seemed to know what I was thinking. I’d go to bring something up—anything from housework to relationship gripes—and before I even opened my mouth, she’d already have it handled, like she’d anticipated it, like she was reading a script.

I chalked it up to her being a great partner. Intuitive. Attentive. One of the good ones. But now… Now I know better. So... it started the day after she left on a work trip.

I’ll admit—I'm not the most attentive boyfriend when it comes to her job. If that makes me a bad partner, fair enough. I know she does something with... insurance? Claims? Risk assessment? Honestly, I just kind of tune out whenever she starts using words like “liability” and “portfolio.” It's not important. What *is* important is that she left about a week ago.

And a day later... I saw her.

I was shopping at the strip mall—just picking up something quick for dinner—and there she was, walking ahead of me, clear as day. Same firm, athletic build. Same sun-kissed skin. Same fiery red hair pulled into that slightly messy twist she always does when she’s running errands. She even had that same confident, effortless stride. From the back, she was a perfect match.

The only difference? Maybe she was a bit shorter. But she was wearing heels, so it was hard to tell. I rushed up, confused, maybe a little heated—I mean, why the hell would she lie about a work trip? But the woman turned, smiled, and—no hesitation—she said, “Oh! You must be Amelia’s boyfriend.”

I stopped in my tracks.

Same face. Same voice. Same hazel eyes with that weird almost-yellow ring around the iris. But it wasn’t her. She introduced herself as *Lucille*. Said she was Amelia’s sister. Weird name. But sure. I mean, families have their quirks. Still, I couldn’t help but ask—why hadn’t Amelia ever mentioned a sister? Lucille laughed it off like it was nothing. “Oh, the family’s complicated,” she said. “We don’t really talk much about our sisters.”

*Our sisters?* Plural.

I tried to ask about that, too, but before I even opened my mouth, she was already shaking her head, smiling like she knew exactly what I was going to say. “Don’t worry,” she said, “everyone always asks that.”

It wasn’t just that she had answers. It was that the answers felt... *prepared.* Like someone writing dialogue for an NPC—calm, friendly, pre-loaded with explanations for questions I hadn’t even asked yet, and that’s when I started to get a very bad feeling but I waved it off.

Lucille turned out to be pretty nice, all things considered. She even spent the rest of the day hanging out with me. Said she wanted to “get to know her sister’s boy toy.” Her words, not mine. I didn’t exactly raise any red flags about that—hell, if I’m considered a trophy grab by my athletic redhead girlfriend, I’ll wear that blue ribbon with pride.

But that’s not really the point. The point is—we hung out, talked, grabbed a late lunch, walked the strip mall like bored teenagers and somewhere along the line... I slipped. I started talking to her like I talked to Amelia, like... effortlessly, like muscle memory.

I’d barely begin a sentence, and Lucille already had an answer. A reaction. A movement. A knowing glance. It wasn’t weird at first—that’s just how it’s always been with Amelia. For the past three years, everything’s just *clicked*. No friction. No stalling. Like she already had every response queued up before I even finished a thought.

With Lucille, it was the same. Honestly? It felt... *refreshing.* Until I got home, until I sat alone that night, tired, lights low, brain idling—and something started gnawing at the back of my head. Why the hell did that feel so familiar? Sure, they're *sisters.* But she said they’re ""estranged""—that they don’t really *talk*. So how the hell are they in sync? They weren’t just close. They were *identical.* And I'm not some rom-com harem protagonist who gets two perfect girls with one brain between them just dropped into his lap. This isn’t supposed to happen. Not like this.

What the *fuck* is going on here? So the next day, I went back out. I needed answers. Or at least... confirmation. Sure enough—there she was. Same spot. Same coffee. Same casual, magazine-model posture like she was waiting for someone. And this time, *she* spotted me first. Waved me down before I even got within twenty feet. and hey, maybe that’s not weird. Amelia’s always been attentive like that. Hyper-aware. Like she can *feel* me coming around the corner. So if Lucille’s her sister—genetics, right?

Except... it’s not just that she spotted me. It’s that she read me. Completely.

I like to think I’m quiet when I want to be. I grew up hunting with my uncle. I know how to move without being noticed. I’m not some stomping buffoon with squeaky shoes and jangling keys, and it never works on Amelia. It didn’t work on Lucille either.

Unfortunately, I didn’t spend the rest of the day unraveling the mystery.

Most of my idle thoughts were eaten up by... well, just the day itself. There was this brand-new movie coming out—I forget the title, something loud and shiny—and the second I saw the poster, my brain latched onto it like a lifeline. I hadn’t slept the night before, too wound up worrying about Amelia, about what I saw—or thought I saw—with Lucille.

But seeing her again in person, with those small but reassuring differences, kind of calmed me down. Distracted me. Gave me a moment to just... breathe. Lucille didn’t act like anything was wrong. If she noticed I was rattled, she played it off well. We spent most of the day just... existing. Talking. Laughing. She had that same casual charm—dry humor, a touch of sass, that tomboy confidence I’d always loved in Amelia.

But then *someone else* came up.

A guy. Tall, built, a little too pretty. Apparently—Lucille has a boyfriend. She lit up when she saw him. And I mean *lit up.* Her whole personality shifted. That rough-edged jock energy smoothed out into something brighter, bubblier—flirty, playful, cutesy. And hey, fine. People act differently around their partners. I get that. I’m not trying to tone-police anyone’s relationship. But this wasn’t a shift. It was a *hard pivot.* Like watching an actor step into a different role without a costume change. In the morning, she was all gruff jokes and sports metaphors. Now she was tossing hair, giggling at nothing, calling him “babe” every other breath like she was auditioning for a CW pilot.

What really unsettled me, though, was the *glances.* Every few minutes, she’d sneak a quick, anxious look over at me—like she was checking whether I was buying it. Then, almost immediately, she’d switch back to the athletic tomboy shtick. Elbows, eye-rolls, jokes about protein shakes and punching bags.

But that just made *him* look confused, and then she'd glance at him—like *he* was the one who didn’t get it—and flip right back to bubbly valley girl again. It was like watching someone caught between two scripts. Two roles. Switching on the fly. Adjusting herself to whoever was watching.

Only now? Both of us were watching, and neither version seemed quite... *right*. Thankfully, her boyfriend—Johnny—turned out to be a cool guy. Real chill. Even invited me to hang out with them.

And I could *see* the worry flash across Lucille’s face when he said that. Just a flicker, but enough to catch. And look—I’m not proud of this, but I can’t let a good thing go. I’m... nosy. I like to say I’m into mysteries, puzzles, piecing things together. But if I’m being honest? I just enjoy knowing things other people don’t want me to know.

So of course I said yes.

Right as I agreed, I swear I heard something—a strange, low growl-sound echo from Lucille’s throat. Like a stutter, but... *wet.* I played it off. Acted like I didn’t hear anything. But the second my brain registered it, it *stopped*. Like it had been waiting for me to notice.

And when I glanced back at her? She looked *scared*. Not embarrassed, not confused, scared. Except Johnny didn’t catch that. He was focused on me. Talking about movies, weekend plans, whatever. Meanwhile, Lucille kept toggling between personalities like she was trying to find the right frequency.

With Johnny? She was bubbly, ditzy, all high-pitched giggles and “babe” this and “babe” that. Like she was auditioning for a bad rom-com. With me? The second we were closer, she’d dip back into the grounded, sporty version. Deadpan humor. Crude jokes. Comfortable sarcasm. The version I *knew*.

It was a ping-pong match of personalities, and Johnny—bless him—eventually picked up on it. “Hey, are you feeling okay?” he asked her. “You’re acting kinda... off.” I took the cue to give them some space. Said I needed to take a call, or whatever excuse I muttered. I walked away. Maybe a hundred feet. Just enough to look like I wasn’t listening.

But I was, and what I saw? That’s when the act *completely* dropped. She didn’t just shift personalities. She *collapsed* into one—full blonde bimbo mode. Over-the-top giggles, exaggerated gestures, syrupy voice. It was like a cartoon parody of a cheerleader from the ‘90s. Even Johnny looked confused. “What was all *that* about?” I heard him ask. She said something—I couldn’t make it out. But it worked. He bought it. Or at least pretended to.

And that’s when an idea sparked. I circled back with snacks in hand, played it cool, and asked if they wanted to hit the arcade tomorrow. Casual hangout. My treat. Johnny lit up. “Yeah, man, that sounds awesome.”

Perfect. Because I had a plan, a plan named Dave. See, normally I wouldn’t involve Dave in something like this. Dave is... look, he’s a lot. He’s the kind of guy who talks like he’s permanently stuck in a noir detective novel and spends *way* too much time on message boards with usernames like “ToxicTruthTeller82.”

But right now? That’s exactly what I need.

Something’s *wrong* here. And everything I’ve seen—the shifting, the mimicry, the voices, the perfectly-packaged responses—it all *feels* like something. I don’t know what. But I figure… if it is something, Dave might trigger it, and if not? Hey, no harm done. Worst-case scenario, I owe Johnny and Lucille lunch. Best-case? I finally get some goddamn *proof*.

Dave, you beautiful, misogynistic piece of shit. God, where do I even start?

The day? The day went great—*for me*, anyway. I still don’t know what I’m going to do with all this new information. But I know a few things now. Some stuff I suspected got denied. Some new questions popped up. But most importantly?

Some things got confirmed.

But first, let me explain Dave. Because you need to *understand* Dave before the arcade mess makes sense. Dave is... how do I put this gently? Dave is what you get when you cross an incel manifesto with a gym membership and an unhealthy addiction to internet forums from 2007.

He’s—okay, I’ll be generous—reasonably fit. Not jacked, but lean. Solid. He doesn’t look like your stereotypical gremlin with Dorito fingers and neckbeard sweat. But personality-wise? Oh, buddy.

Dave genuinely, *unironically*, believes women’s suffrage was a mistake. That the natural order is a man going out to “hunt and conquer,” while the woman stays home making sandwiches and raising children with zero opinions and zero resistance.

He’s a walking Reddit thread in human form. Now, I know what you’re thinking. *Why are you friends with this guy?*And the answer is: I’m not. Not really.

He’s in my online guild. He lives nearby. We’ve run some raids together, grabbed drinks once or twice. He’s one of those *small doses* kind of guys. Tolerable in ten-minute intervals, maybe thirty if he’s on new meds or just got laid (hypothetically).

But today? Today was not a small-dose day. And honestly? I feel bad for Johnny. The poor bastard didn’t deserve what was coming. *I* knew what I was doing when I invited Dave. Lucille? She was the test subject, the canary in the coal mine, so I don’t feel too bad. But Johnny? He was just caught in the blast radius.

The Arcade, so I get there early. But not first. Dave’s already there. *By design.* See, I needed time. Time to prep him. To prime him. So I start feeding Dave the gospel according to Lucille.

I tell him she’s his dream woman—right down to the apron and the white picket fence. I tell him she doesn’t vote (“doesn’t believe it’s her place”), that she wants a big family, loves cooking, adores all the neat little kitchen gadgets the patriarchy keeps cranking out. She believes a woman’s role is in the home, behind the man, barefoot, busy, and smiling.

The whole damn checklist. Dave’s eyes go wide. Suspicious but hungry. He knows it’s too good to be true. But Dave? Dave’s not a social guy. When it comes to people, especially women, he leans on others to do the navigating. So he lets me lead him into the forest with nothing but red flags and blind faith. And look—I’d feel bad if he weren’t a complete piece of shit. But this? This is for *science*.

Honestly, at this point I’m starting to feel like I’m doing a public service. For Johnny. For myself. For *mankind.* Because the more I see, the more I *know*—Lucille and Amelia aren’t just sisters. They’re not even twins. They’re… *something else*.

There’s a deeper connection here. Something fundamental. Something wrong. So I fill Dave’s head with expectations. I make Lucille into his personal fantasy. And then? An hour later, they arrive. Johnny and Lucille.

She walks in looking radiant, sharp, athletic—until her eyes land on Dave. Instant disgust. Not subtle. Not polite. Not socially acceptable. *Pure, unfiltered disgust,* and then—like a flip being switched—she slides into it. That *personality* I programmed Dave with, the apron-wearing, soft-spoken, subservient, 1950s sitcom housewife *bimbo*.

Johnny looks like someone just unplugged his brain. He’s not used to seeing *this* version of her. Hell, even I’m stunned by how hard she leans into it. It’s not just mimicry—it’s overcorrection. Like Dave’s expectations are *louder* than ours. Like they’re drowning us out.

She can’t find Johnny. She can’t find *me.* Not until Dave excuses himself to the bathroom, and in that brief moment—*bam*—she stumbles. The act collapses. She looks at me. And not like before. This time, it’s *dangerous*. Not annoyed, not embarrassed, dangerous and then? She becomes *something else.*

Not valley-girl Lucille, or sporty Lucille, not even the Dave-fantasy. A *hybrid.* She molds herself into a perfect intersection between what Johnny wants—and what *I* perceive. Not desire—just *observe*. She’s combining traits. Borrowing expectations. Sculpting a third self out of two imaginations.

Johnny thinks she’s just holding herself together, maybe she’s tired, maybe hormonal, who knows right? But I see it. I *get* it. *This isn’t a person.* It’s a *mirror with too many inputs.*

And Dave—goddamn, Dave—threw a wrench into the calibration. A massive, walking contradiction with a loud, rigid worldview and a brain like a sledgehammer. Lucille—it—*whatever*—is glitching.

The day drags on, we play games, eat pizza, talk shit, laugh. But the cracks? They show. In the way she shifts tones midsentence. The way her laugh keeps morphing pitch depending on who’s listening. The way she can’t keep her hand gestures straight—graceful when Johnny watches, but abrupt and efficient when my eyes are on her.

By the time we say goodbye, I have a working hypothesis: She—*it*—is skimming us. Not reading minds. Not deep thoughts. But surface-level noise. Expectations. Assumptions. The *characters* we’ve cast her as in our heads. She’s trying to be all of them. At once. And it’s starting to fail.

She found me later that night. It was around 3AM. I was still awake—of course I was—staring at my ceiling like it held answers. And then came the knock, sharp, clean, three perfectly timed raps. I opened the door, and there she was.

Lucille but taller hell *Several inches* taller than she’d been earlier that day. Her smile hit me first, wide, too wide. And then she spoke. Used my *full name*.

I didn’t even know people knew my full name. I don’t *use* it. It’s not on my socials, not on my gamer tags. Hell, it’s barely in my mail. But she said it. Softly. Casually. Like she’d said it a thousand times before.

And then—every move I *thought* to make, every question that started to form in my mind—she *cut it off* with a response. Perfectly timed. Witty. Smug. Like she was walking through a scene she’d already rehearsed.

And all the while, her grin just kept widening. That’s when I saw the teeth. Imagine something like a vampire. You’ve got the two signature fangs, sure. Now add two more—slightly smaller—on either side. That’s three points. Now mirror that to the lower jaw, *six top six bottom.* Curved like a dog’s canines, but longer, sharper, inhuman.

Still, she kept talking. Holding a full conversation with me like this was all completely normal. and I never said a word throughout our whole talk. Finally, she leaned down and whispered into my ear:**“You’re very lucky one of my sisters has already claimed you.”**

Then she turned and walked away. No vanishing into mist. No scuttling up walls. Just an unceremonious turn on her heel and a slow, almost sulking stride back into the night. The rest of the night crawled by as the slightest noise or shifting shadow had me jumping out of my skin.

The next morning, there was a Facebook post. **Johnny’s accepted a new job. He and his girlfriend are moving away.** Simple, normal, clean. And I just stared at it. I was rattled, shaken, paralyzed. It took three days—maybe four—before I got myself together enough to *move*. To *breathe* without checking the corners of every room first.

And then I did the only thing I could think to do. I started researching. Which brings us to now. You see, one thing’s been tickling the back of my head. When I first met Lucille, she said *sisters*—plural. Not “Amelia and I.” Not “the two of us.” Just *sisters.* Which means there’s more. *How many more?* What the hell is going on? Well... almighty Facebook might shed some light. And if not? There’s always Google and I had three days before Amelia was due home.

See, my research turned up some interesting things, patterns, threads, little connections you’d never notice unless you *knew* what to look for and I didn’t, not at first. But once you start pulling a thread, it’s hard to stop.

Turns out, Amelia—my girlfriend—and Lucille? They’ve got a *huge* extended family. All tan. All gorgeous. All with that same athletic build like they were sculpted by a fitness-obsessed god, redheads, blondes, brunettes, the full rainbow-colored hair spectrum doesn’t matter that the one thing other than eye color that doesn’t seem to matter. But what's more interesting is that almost none of them are single.

They’re all married or dating someone like me—*up-and-comers*. Ambitious, smart, on or over the edge of wealth. I'm set to become a senior programmer next year and start pulling an upper-six figure salary. Johnny? Owned multiple mechanic shops, the quiet kind of wealthy, and every last one of these couples?

Happy.

Smiling.

*Perfectly content.*

Not a single complaint. Not one bad word about their significant other. Not even in *passing*. Then there is the discovery that Amelia’s family members age well, too, like, *suspiciously* well. Still gorgeous in their sixties, wrinkle-free, sharp, vibrant. Then they hit their eighties... and die, tragic accidents, sudden illness, house fires, drownings, you name it.

But they always leave behind *big, happy families,* usually daughters, all of them looking *just like their mother*. But that’s not what really caught my attention. No, that was the missing persons cases. Every town they live in—every one of them—has an *unusually high* rate of disappearances. Not one or two a year, One or two a *month*. People vanish, no trace, no leads, no bodies. Then—when the family moves? The cases drop slowly and steadily like someone easing off the gas.

One town I tracked: 240 missing persons in ten years, they left. The numbers flattened down to three over the next two years. So I checked *my* town. I’ve been dating Amelia for three years. Thirty-six people have gone missing, but here’s the thing even if I reported this who really believes me, like honestly? Hell looking at all the evidence? I’ll probably live a long life, get my dream job, and raise a big, happy family.

Probably all daughters.

Probably gorgeous.

Probably... *not quite human.*

There’s a knock at the door, she’s home, the door opens. And there she stands—Amelia. My girlfriend. I think that word is still appropriate. Her smile widens, just enough to catch the light on her... fangs? Yeah. I’m going with fangs. They peek out from beneath her lips as she steps inside and sets her bag down. I don’t say anything, but she answers anyway.**“So, I see you met my family.”** She pauses and smiles wider. **“Well, I’m glad to know you’re so... accepting.”** 

And the door closes behind her.

Often times, drivers blindly exit the McDonalds parking lot without checking for pedestrians coming from the left or right, and often don't look forward before accelerating.

I've been bumped into at least 3 times there within the past 1-2 years and last week an elderly man on a mobility scooter was hit by a driver and knocked off of his mobility scooter while scootin' down the sidewalk.

Visibility is totally clear, but, the drive thru window is maybe 60' from the sidewalk - maybe that is what's causing so many accidents - switching from queueing to driving - or, maybe receiving a coffee or hamburger 15-30 seconds earlier is what's causing distractions - I don't know - but it sucks.

Is there any way to request a stop sign somewhere in your town?

1m5hoh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/1m5hoh4/ftm_to_5_month_old_struggling_with_postpartum_and/,Ftm to 5 month old struggling with postpartum and rage. Partner left me after I asked him to help with the baby,"Trigger warning, suicide, sexual assault.

I (34F) have a daughter that just turned 5 months this morning. I started struggling during my pregnancy and I'm not sure if I just had a rough pregnancy or it's a combination from symptoms I struggle with an old traumatic brain injury and hoshimotos. My partner kept telling me that he didn't understand why I would be in bed some days all day as women work all the time during their full pregnancy. 

I started getting a lot more anxiety than usual prepping for the baby. Different things would just send me into a mental spiral and I felt like it would become a I have to protect my baby issue. One was that my partner and his disabled brother would smoke in his car that they share. I was adamant that our daughter would never ride in that car if they didn't stop smoking in it. My partner said he would stop but that he couldn't control his brother, even though it is my partner's car. This topic continued for days and it got to the point where I felt I had to leave the relationship to protect my baby as they were going to continually subject her to second/third hand smoke. I don't know still if I was overreacting. My anxiety still spikes thinking about it and I begin to physically shake from the stress. My partner eventually came to the compromise that we would just only take my car with the baby so that way I would be confident she wasn't being around smoke.He was upset I wanted to end things over this. I felt backed into a corner that no one cared how concerned I was for the baby and no one listened until way past my line in the sand, and even the solution put all child transportation on my shoulders. Not that I mind the driving. But sole long term wear and tear, gas costs, and what if my car needed repairs etc. All while his brother then gets sole control of their car. It felt like rewarding him for being unwilling to compromise for the family, while I end up picking up the slack.

There were other issues, like his brother's racism (I'm native American), how he doesn't think women should be allowed to vote ( my concern for our daughter living with that message every day), his open hostility to gay( he uses the f word that is not 4 letters which what does that do to her if she grows up as anything but hetero?), he threats to put a shock collar on my dog because she barked in the house (this was one of the times I put the line in the sand...you do not threaten to hurt my charges), how he has loaded guns all over his room not locked up, how he is on oxycodone and routinely goes through it so fast the Drs make him wait (while he complains that they shouldn't be controlling how much he takes, he is in pain and he used to snort 80 mgs at a time so the dose he is asking for help definitely won't od from, I kid you not he said that to us and the Dr🙄 ). Each time I made it a point that I didn't like living with his brother or that his brother was taking resources from what we could be saving for the baby, I was the problem and was just trying to kick his brother out. I got mad because his brother let his VA benefits lapse and my partner had been paying for absolutely everything for him and then gave him a $500 a month allowance. When asked if he could try and get his VA benefits back he said almost exactly that he was concerned that it would be less than what my partner was giving him and he didn't want to risk getting less than what he was be given if it was just easier to not apply and have my partner support him. 😡

 Think I went full psycho in my pregnancy during that phase. I told my partner that his brother wasn't an invalid and that he wasore than capable of at least applying for his VA benefits. If he didn't push for him to and continued to pay for everything and give him an allowance after his brother admitted to using him like that, that I couldn't see us being together as I was all in on contributing to the family and the future of our child. If he was supporting a dead beat essentially that just spent his days being a troll on the Internet he was taking resources from our child. We almost ended it there but he finally was convinced by his extended family to push back on his brother. When he did he say there and didn't say anything while his brother verbally attacked me for being the worst because everything was great before I came along and stuck my evil tentacles into everything. His brother eventually got full disability with the VA. He now gets 4k a month, which is more than I was bringing home. I got a half hearted thanks for making me apply.😐 Well that and a check on the trying to abandon my partner book that led to us breaking up.

During my birth and stay after in the hospital my partner and my mother had to go down to the ER and the other part of the hospital because his brother wouldn't go to follow up appointments and ended up in the hospital again. I had my first breakdown when I was left alone the day I gave birth in the hospital for hours while they were both with him. My daughter was crying and I was physically not doing well. 

When we got home and out of the NICU I really struggled. My partner because we were in Oregon was allowed up to 12 weeks paternal leave. He took two before he felt that the baby was doing ok and that he needed to get back to work because he had stuff that had to get done but he also missed it and wanted to return to normal. I begged him to take more time off because I needed him. I wasn't sleeping and was struggling with breastfeeding and well everything. He went back to work, he works from home but his office is no go land and if I need help and interrupt he would get mad.

We had agreed before the baby came that we would take shifts in the night so we both got sleep. He before would sleep 4-6 hours and feel good, whereas I needed 9-10 to feel functional. Right about when he went back to work he stopped helping as much in the middle of the night. When he slipped a disc in his back he stopped completely. That week alone was hell. For the first 12 hours he couldnt even get up to pee so I had to bring him a bottle to pee in and everything else he needed. I don't mind helping but I hadn't slept and the baby still needed me 100%. When he could sit up on the couch he didn't offer to help with the baby for a full week. Way after he could at least had me sit her in the nursing pillow and he could have fed her just so I could get 5 mins to sit down, nope. 

After that week it became a conversation that I needed to take care of 90% plus of the child care as he had to focus on work. I was still a full time student with a stipend tied to my grades. I ended up dropping some classes and taking incompletes for the rest. When asked if he would take a shift in the middle of the night he replied he would take the 8 am shift. I spent most nights sitting in the living room so that I could let him sleep as he'd get mad that the baby would cry in the bedroom and would have me take her out there anyway when I was feeding her so he could sleep. He would take her from anywhere 1-5 hours some days in the morning while he worked. I had suck a hard time falling asleep though. He would never take her at the same time or even every day. He needed a coffee and a smoke to fully wake up before even considering letting me have time to take a nap. Then he might come in and change he waking me up, or he has a meeting so I'd have to wake up and take her. 

I know he also is going through postpartum as he has been sleeping about 8-10hours since the baby was born. I hate it but I hate that he gets uninterrupted sleep. I'm so jealous and angry that he gets to do that. That he can sleep through the crying, drink until he falls asleep, or that he doesn't wake up with his breasts hurting because oops he slept for a full 3 hours for once. I don't know if it's postpartum or just if I am justified and this is he's a jerk and I'm raging because of that.

We planned to move to Washington at the end of May. Two days before we were set to leave a ton of packing and to be done still. I was so tired I was having hallucinations and I just broke. I remember sitting on the couch telling him that I felt like I was slowly dieing. Not figuratively, but literally felt like my body was just giving up and I was scared that I couldn't do it anymore. I didn't have the energy to continue to pack and take care of the baby. I told him I could still figure out how to take care of our daughter but he needed to finish the packing. He told me that it was a herculean effort to pack the rest of the house in two days while working and if I expected him to do so I should just move without him as he wasn't going to do it. I don't know if it is or was the postpartum but I just felt like he told me he didn't care if I died and me asking for help was too much and he didn't want to move with me anymore. He told me I could move but he wanted our daughter to stay with him. I remember a bit of the next 12 hours but not much. I remember something about telling my mom I needed help because he left us and I needed help moving. I remember a feeling of rage akin to not wanting to waste urine to piss on a man on fire even to save him. I believe I said some very pointed things that he will never forgive. 

When I broke from the rage I tried to talk to him and nope that was it. I had in his eyes left him and now I was a stranger. It's been months now and I've been raising my daughter mostly on my own. He wants 50/50 custody but is sometimes too tired, has a headache, or his brother needs him so he doesn't see her but a couple times a week. It's been 6 days this morning since he has had her last. 

He has moved three times since we split. Now has two residences that I've helped him love, clean, etc each time. I was so stressed at the beginning of the month. On the 4th he did a group call with his family to me and they grilled me about trying to take all his money. He is giving me about 200 over what his child support would be but I provide all the clothes, diapers, breast milk, formula, furniture etc from sourceing at low income spots, formula from WIC and going to the diaper banks etc so I am trying to help out how I can. I have been letting him see our daughter almost anytime he wants and video call him for morning and nights just for him to be able to talk to her if he is too busy to stop by. The conversation with his family broke me. They told me I shouldn't have my daughter, that I needed to sell my house because he shouldn't be contributing to my mortgage, that they looked into my past and saw I had court appearances for cases before and I obviously was up to old tricks. I was married when I was 20 to a 28 year old man in the army that used to beat the shit out of me, repeatedly would rape. I have PTSD diagnosis from that and it fucking sucks to have to remember that. I didn't have to defend myself but I went through it again mentally trying to tell them how I used to have to hide in my closet after or the times he tried to kill me or how he got off on me being in pain so it just kept getting worse over time until I was able to get out and yeah filled for a retraining order. I broke on the 4th after that call. My mom actually walked in while I was still on the phone sobbing as they yelled at me while holding my daughter and she just took the phone out of my hand and ended the call. I gave my mom my daughter a few hours later asking my partner to pick her up and confirming verbally he would pick her up before I went home and took some medication and tried to take a water nap that didn't end. 

I did wake up the next day and tried to check myself in for help. The Zoloft 150 obviously was having a bad reaction or I just had too much stress I don't know. I hated how I felt on the medication and I just needed to not be alone or I knew I would try again. 
I had back to back panic attacks in the hospital and checked myself out within hours. Home alone I slept for the first time several hours in almost 5 months. It helped a bit.

I helped my partner move from his third floor apartment to the first floor the next week. My mother and I did a good majority of the moving as my partner had to work and his brother won't help and has been hurting that week so he wasn't physically up for much anyhow. The next day when we came back to clean while he was at work I tried pumping with my travel pump after being too tired to pump in the middle of the night. It had been about 8 hrs since I last pumped because I was taking care of the baby and had to get all the stuff ready to clean. I pumped for 30 mins and got nothing. My milk supply had been going down because of stress but to see it stop. I just broke down sobbing while we were cleaning. I just kept working on dishes but couldn't talk at all. My partner said his step Mom switched to cows milk at 6 months so it was no big deal. And to talk to a Dr before I got upset. I message my Dr and they said I could try medication but it could permanently give me tremors. Instead they wanted me to try hanging out in bed with the baby for about three days just getting a ton of skin to skin and only focus on myself and baby for that time keeping stress low. I asked my partner to come over and hang out with us for a bit and if he wouldn't mind making us dinner one night. My food stamps don't cover more than ingredients or frozen meals so it was going to be tough to coon and spend the time the way the Dr was asking. My partner told me he didn't want to and didn't have the time to play maid for me. He did allow me to have her for a couple days. I spent those days with him working on sorting through our stuff in 90 plus degrees in my garage so that he could move down to Oregon for his second residence this weekend.

Yesterday, Sunday, was our anniversary. He didnt call or answer my calls all day. I sent him a message telling him I was able to get a changing table, baby chair, and a rolling cart for him and happy anniversary. He didn't do anything except tell me it's not our anniversary because we aren't together and that I left him and this day just makes him sad now. I've been trying to repair things and work on us even going out on a date. He wants us to try and be friends but I don't know how to be friends if he is unsupportive and ignores how much I am being a friend to him. I understand I am a bitch right now at times in my postpartum. I don't know though how much of my feelings and rage are normal or actually postpartum. 

Am I wrong to feel like he abandoned me in postpartum? Has anyone else hated your partner while still loving them? Anyone else had rage so bad you don't remember chunks of time because of sleep deprivation or the postpartum? Or am I just really a terrible partner and mom?",1,1753101206.0,Postpartum_Depression,0,0.67,False

Gender: Male

Age: 32

Height & Weight: 6'0 & 70kg. Skinny yet somehow muscular. Long hairs and clean shaved.

Marital status: Single. Never married, never engaged, never dated or been in relationships.

Education: Masters in Computer science 

Profession: IT

Hobbies: I don't just have one thing. It all depends what excites me. Sometimes i like to cook, sometimes bake. I really like to research and copy recipes from restaurants I visit.

Do you want kids? Yes if Allah wills it. 

Religion: I think religion is personal but also very important aspect of life. When at work i pray with jamaat but when i get home I'm too tired so just pray in my room. I try to pray 4 times currently trying to adjust my sleep schedule so that i start my day from Fajr.


I don't pray because i am told to do it, i pray because i feel in my heart the need to. 

Deal breakers: Not being kind or generous. Empathy matters alot. Past relationships and abusive language.

Interesting facts about you: There isn't just one. 


Gaming: Ever since i could remember i loved gaming. Starting from Atari to mobile gaming to now gaming on my laptop. Not a day goes by that i don't play on my lappy. 3rd person, first person, rpg, simulation, city building etc.


Cooking: Honestly after trying xanders and other places in karachi I've been left disappointed. Not only you pay hefty price but also tax and tips. Later then when the food that comes it's either disappointing or too less in quantity. After getting my heart broken I've learnt to copy every recipe from youtube and make it myself. From pasta's to shawarma to burrtios to rotisserie chicken, i can make anything at home. Provided i can procure the necessary ingredients.


History/Sci fi Lover: I can go on and on about roman/greek history or world wars. Also I'm into karl marx's Communist manifesto and Art of War by Sun Tzu. Space is another thing that fascinates me. I imagine what the colonizing of other planets would be like, terra forming and what would happen if we come across some alien species.


Independent: I have always valued independence. I have my own separate space from parents, my own floor. I live independently with my own furniture etc and cook my own food. Not that i'm separated or anything i just believe having my own things and place. I like to keep things this way after marriage. 


Ambitious: I have a plans and goals for myself in life and I'm always hyper focussed towards them. I don't compete with anyone but myself. Where was i standing last year and where i am right now. I don't like simple things, i wish to be unique. 

I've already acquired separate accomodation with furniture and air conditioning. Next is purchasing my own personal car (already have a family car and bike) and then one day insha'Allah my own house. 


Coffee Lover: I just love coffee. Chai is okayish but a good cup of coffee goes a very long way. If I can't find cofffee anywhere i keep a pump handy with me and brew a shot when and where I feel like it. Plus i own a coffee machine so i can make espresso, cappuccino or latte whenever i feel like it. I buy beans and grind them myself. Mostly Italian imported beans. Mix coffee with monin chocolate syrup and sprinke some cinnamon dust on top and you'll have a pleasure bomb in you mouth. 



Anime Weeb: I can't help it. I am who i am. Been watching anime since my early teens. Digimon adventures, Shaman king and Duel masters were the early anime that got me hooked and in love with them. 



Fitness: My job is something where i have to sit for 8 hours in front of a computer. Not much to walk or move around. Fearing that i have created my own small gym at my place. I workout daily whether its with dumbbells, curling rod or stretching on yoga mat. If I can't workout in morning i do it after work.


Spontaneous Personality: I am very spontaneous. I make up plans as i go. Out of nowhere I would ask you to let's go out to eat. Or make something i just saw on youtube or go shopping on a working day by taking a sick leave 😂


I live everyday like its my last. Don't wait to do something and just do it.


Extremely Ambivert: I like quiet and alone time but i am also a yapper. People say i talk alot but my job demands me having a good communication skill. Plus having good relations with your co workers goes a long way. 


Moun Phath: I can't stress this enough. I am extremely moun phath regardless of who is on the opposite end. If they something silly then i can't help make fun of them. Few examples as follows:


HR during interview: Apka is saal shadi ka koi irada hai? 


Me: Apke nazar main koi hai? 


HR: 🫩


Another example:


Me to manager: Kal agar barish hogaye tou WFH 


Manager: Aray tou yango kara kar garey main ajana. 


Me: Agar woh na available ho tou helicopter karalo? 🚁   


Manager: 🫤


City: Karachi the city of lights and mobile snatchings. 

Residence (Own/Rented): Own 

Family details: Father retd, mother home maker and a brother married and settled in gulf. 

Joint/nuclear(Optional): Nuclear.

Requirements: Age between 25 to 32. Age is just a number. Life hardships makes us adult before our time. If you are as tall as me then its not a problem. I like that. If you are curvy/overweight/healthy by Pakistani standards then this is also not a problem. I prefer that actually. To me what matters most is what inside your heart. I wanna come home to peace and calm and a good woman can provide that. Regardless of race, gender, ethnicity or skin color. I just want someone who would love and respect me just as I would them. 

Expectations from the partner: I don't believe in having expectations because often times people have unrealistic expectations and i just don't want to be like them. I want to be unique, be myself and if we are compatible and have a connection/chemistry. 


Jahaiz: Don't like it, don't want it. I already have a fully furbished room with furniture from Habitt, it doesn't get any better then this. 

Timeframe in which you want to marry(Optional): I would like to see if we are good for each other before involving parents. Usually in our khandan we don't wait and if all is good then marriage happens on 3-4 months. 


If you have read all the above mentioned text and are somewhat interested, then kindly comment or email so that i may get to know you and we'll see if our stars align ✨ ⭐

I’m 29F, Midwest-raised (first-gen Macedonian-American), and moved back to Pleasanton in January after a bit of a winding journey. I first came to the Bay in 2020 for work—started in national lab research, but ended up taking a step back to re-evaluate life, moved back home for a while, and now I’m here again—ironically living just minutes away from my old employer.

These days, I work from home doing personal assisting and life coaching, while building my own cybersecurity consulting business. I also freelance for small businesses—helping them with branding, setting up websites, evaluating POS systems, and tightening their digital security posture. I love helping people get their ideas off the ground and feel more in control of their tech.

I live with two close friends who are in a long-term relationship, which is lovely but means I’m often playing third wheel. I’m looking to connect with people who are curious, kind, and open to building something genuine—whether it’s a friendship, creative collaboration, or just a chill walking buddy who doesn’t mind philosophical tangents.

# Some things about me:
- I’m super into technology (cybersecurity is my niche), but also love talking about behavior, psychology, design, music, and why we do the things we do.
- I’m a naturally curious person and love conversations that spiral into new ideas—especially with people who get excited about weird questions or obscure interests.
- I’ve got a big creative streak—love making things with my hands, personalizing everything I touch, and expressing myself however I can.
- I enjoy alternative music and try to hit a few shows or festivals each year.
- Physically, I’m not super athletic and deal with chronic neck/back stuff (cyber gremlin posture lol), so you won’t catch me at the gym—but I’m into light movement, stretching, and trying new things like beginner acro yoga.
- I have a senior Pembroke Welsh Corgi who still loves short walks and would happily join for dog-friendly hangs 🐶

# What I’m hoping to find:

Honestly, just people I vibe with. Not looking for constant plans, just the option to meet up for a walk, try a random event, chat over coffee, or share space without pressure. I’d especially love to meet other creative or neurodivergent folks, or people who’ve carved nontraditional paths and are figuring it out as they go.

I’ve tried a lot of apps and platforms for meeting people, but I’ve found they rarely lead to meaningful connection. So I’m throwing this out here in case you’re someone who:
- Misses deeper conversations
- Enjoys learning from others
- Likes thinking out loud
- Or just wants a local person in your corner to bounce ideas off of

Even if you’re not looking for a new friend right now, feel free to save my info in case you ever need a cybersecurity sanity check, website advice, POS system tips, or just a second opinion on some random tech thing. I usually have thoughts 😄

Thanks for reading—and if anything here resonates, feel free to comment or DM. I’d love to hear from you.",6,1753100930.0,pleasanton,2,1.0,False
1m5hkmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/veterinaryschool/comments/1m5hkmx/vet_school_admissions_help/,Vet School Admissions Help!,"Good morning friends! I'm currently about to start my senior year in Animal Science and am fretting about vet school applications, as I'm sure many of us are lol. For reference: I'm applying next cycle (for 2027 admission), since my in-state school requires science pre-requisites to be in progress or completed at application, and I'll be working on mine right up until graduation.

I started as a nursing major freshman year, hated it, found a passion for vet med, then transferred schools/majors. I struggled pretty hard freshman and sophomore year but have since gotten it together and have seen my grades begin an upward trend. Regardless, I understand how important GPA is and I'm still anxious about my prospectives.

My stats will likely be, at time of application, as follows:

* cGPA and sGPA: \~3.1-3.2
* Last 45: \~3.5-3.6 (as long as my grades continue as they have been the last 2 semesters)
* My veterinary hours are split between a mixed animal, rural GP(\~2500 hours) plus a summer interning as a surgical veterinary intern for a drug development company (\~500 hours) = \~3000 hours.
* My non-veterinary animal experience hours include working as a shift manager at a kennel/doggie daycare for 3.5 years (\~5500 hours), volunteering with a service dog registry for 1.5 years (\~1000 hours), working for a professional dog handler at dog shows (\~900 hours), volunteering for a dog show club putting on events (\~600 hours), and volunteering at my school's veterinary hospital (\~100 hours) = \~8100 hours.
   * I also was a shift manager at a coffee shop for a year, which I hope to include since I think it demonstrates leadership abilities.
* In addition, my family also breeds and shows dogs in AKC events, we have my whole life, but was VERY heavily involved in that from 15-18 years old and have been pretty consistently involved since I was 10 (around 11 years)- but unsure how to calculate those and include them in my VMCA's... if anyone has insight on how I should include that, please let me know!
* Will for sure have 2-3 LOR from veterinarians I've worked with closely at my clinic job, plus my RVT supervisor at my drug development internship, plus my volunteer mentor at the service dog registry. Also working to get a LOR from a professor (fingers crossed!)

I'm definitely under-involved in campus activities but I plan to join a non-animal related book club and also an Animal Science-related club this year, however with it being my senior year, that likely won't have a heavy emphasis on my application.

All in all (sorry this is so long!): I am looking for EXPERIENCE HEAVY vet school recommendations! As of now, I plan on: Purdue (my in-state school/alma mater), Auburn, Iowa State, Michigan State, Texas A&M, University of Florida, and Kansas State. Is there any you would recommend taking off, or adding onto, my list? Also, any recommendations to boost my resume (besides doing a master's program- with the BBB, I don't want to restrict myself too much financially)?

Thank you in advance and so sorry for the long post!!!!",2,1753100908.0,veterinaryschool,8,0.75,False

A while ago they changed the Almond milk creamer, which was perfect & creamy and you didn't need that much of it. Then something changed and you had to use a lot more of it, and the colour/texture were different. Because of that I made the switch to their Soy creamer which I fell in love with. Seems like it disappeared for a bit and then came back with a slightly new look and once again they changed something. It curdles every single time unless you use WAY more of it, to the point where you just don't taste the coffee anymore. I've tried so many DF creamers and I'm sad that my favourite ones are not usable for me anymore.

How do you deal with insecurity in group situations? Is there anyone here who maybe dealt with Body Dysmorphia or cheating/inadequacy fears? 

Throwaway. Long-ish post ahead. Please be gentle. 

I’m 28F, partner is 28M, we’ll call him “K”. Both bi. 

3-ish years relationship, love each other to bits. Lot of ups and downs cos we live a very unstable lifestyle (freelancers, travelling, insecure housing etc) and I have always battled with my mental health, plus he’s a hothead. We’ve gotten better, yadda yadda. 

- I had BDD, 0 self-worth, extremely insecure, jealous and terrified of being cheated on. I catastrophize all the time and spent the past year working really fucking hard on this. 
- I used to freak out if K even put his hand on a woman’s shoulder or went to coffee with a female friend not previously ‘vetoed.’
- My insecurity and self-hatred are absolutely entangled with my attraction towards women. When I was young, I assumed my attraction was jealousy, and built those damn neural pathways thereafter. 
- I never initiated. Never expressed physical desire towards anyone. Was always led.  Never asserted my attraction or took a ‘sexy’ risk. 

 Last year we made a lot of new poly/ENM/relationship anarchist friends. It came to light that we want to try opening up. I miss feminine energy and we agree there’s so much experience out there to be had. 

I didn’t read a whole lot of resources (changing that), since I thought it would come more naturally. We had many talks about boundaries and comms. Nothing major has happened yet, but I have since got more comfortable with cuddling, hand holding, things I couldn’t even do before, like literally grabbing my friend by the waist to scare them, or rubbing their back. 

We both agreed we want to start opening up with group play, or having a third, before we consider solo. It’s all about physical experiences for now. And I have a TON of suppressed physical desires that I’m craving, beyond what he can supply. But I want to do it together, with him, to start. So it’s not all about him - I’m forgetting about my own experiences a lot though. 

My bf chooses to be my bf every day. How do I stop having these feelings every single time I imagine these scenarios? I used to freak out at him all the time. 


P.S yes I’m doing shadow work stuff. I’ve had 8 different courses of therapy and multiple drugs over the decades that didn’t work. Only thing that worked is change in circumstance, willpower, good friends, and hallucinogenics.  Even if I wanted to stay mono, I would absolutely still work on this shit.

1m5hfns,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteriesRP/comments/1m5hfns/soil_and_sovereign_mission/,Soil and Sovereign - mission,"""It is not crowns that make empires last
It is hands, dirt-covered and calloused, that sow the loyalty we reap.""

-The Emperor-

The empire stretched from northern ends of the Postel city, its veins pulsing life, new citizens and slow-burning ambition. It was just the start. People whispered behind mirrored doors. And high above it all, the Empire's top servants and followers- each with the power to shake a nation- stood ever watchful.
So when word arrived that a farmer’s ox had gone missing, the goat was ill, and a barley fence had collapsed…

No one expected the response.
“We’re going,” the Emperor declared with a grin, standing at the center of all of his most loyal servants like it was a game of dice and not the planning of territories.
Leo didn’t react, just crossed his arms.
Cillian blinked “ You must be joking?”
Alex Anderson lowered his glasses and raised an eyebrow. “Wait, you're serious? I never would've guessed you'd be into farming”
“Of course,” the Emperor said smoothly. “The empire will be built on blood, trust and loyalty. Let them see that we’re more than names in books and storms in the distance. We build an empire not by force- but by being worth following.”

And so, four of the most dangerous men in the known world set off to fix a farm.
_____________________________________________
The four of them took a small carriage to the farm. The emperor and Alex sat inside, while Leo was in the front and Cillian was riding on his own horse nearby.

“So, do you ever talk?” Cillian asks Leo who was just staring forward. “or is brooding just your way of asking for attention?”
Leo blinked. Once. “Would it matter?”
“Only if I was worried you were mute,” Cillian replied. “Or worse- 

poetic.”

A beat. The wind blew. The road curved.
Leo didn’t look at him. “Words are expensive. Speak when only needed”
Cillian snorted, dry as dead leaves. “Right. Because you're so deep, no one can possibly comprehend your tortured inner self.”
Leo’s gaze stayed forward, calm as water without reflection. “Never claimed to be tortured.”
“No,” Cillian said. “But you wear it like a fashion statement. All that silence. The stares. The crow.”
He gestured vaguely toward Charlotte, who blinked at him like he was a particularly stupid insect.
“She's not a crow,” Leo said mildly. “She’s a reminder.”
“Of what? Your personality?”
Leo’s lips twitched. It wasn’t a smile. It was the memory of one. “Of what happens when people talk too much.”
Cillian considered that. “Cute. Still, if you’re going to be cryptic the whole time, at least be helpful. Maybe whisper to the chickens. Curse some pigs. Or make someone's mind explode.”
Leo tilted his head. “Do you really believe your sarcasm counts as conversation?”
“I believe silence is dangerous,” Cillian replied. “It usually means someone’s about to do something stupid. Or already has.”
Leo finally looked at him. Just slightly. The kind of glance that felt like being weighed by something that remembered how to hunger.
“Don’t worry,” he said. “When I do something stupid, you’ll be the first to know. Probably by corpse count.”
Cillian dabbled back. “Great. Looking forward to the kill count.”

They rode in silence after that.

A peaceful, unsettling silence- like two predators in the same clearing, neither quite hungry enough to make the first move.
From inside the carriage, the Emperor muttered, “Are they flirting, or planning to kill each other?”

Alex who is looking down on his star charts. Look up at the Emperor and smile nervously “hmm i’m not sure, but i hope it the former and not the latter”
Cillian, with his keen senses explodes from laughter outside, to the point of almost falling off his horse. Leo gives him a look, not in confusion, just curiosity.
“You’d need a sense of humor and emotion to understand it” Cillian answers the look. 
Inside the carriage the Emperor is laughing and turns to Alex. “definitely flirting.” This earned a loud hit on the outside of the carriage.

After a long and winding ride through rugged countryside, the four travelers reached the edge of the Outer Fractures, a quiet portion of the plains that once formed the heartland of the old Empire. 

Here, the land wore its history like a half-forgotten song. And in the distance, silhouetted by soft clouds and fading grandeur, loomed the shattered outline of a once, majestic kingdom. Its towers, though broken, still stood proudly, like bones of a giant that refused to be buried.

The Emperor stared at it in silence. His gaze didn’t soften, if anything, it sharpened. In his dark eyes, there wasn’t sorrow, nor nostalgia, but something older. Something colder. A kind of hunger, a longing to rebuild what is rightfully him. 

A promise.

“We’re here,” Leo announced, snapping the Emperor from his thoughts.
The Emperor blinked once, and the spark faded. “Yes. Very good.”
Beside him, Alex folded away his star charts and stood. He looked at his liege with a soft smile. “Shall we, my lord? Your destination awaits.”

The Emperor gave a simple nod and stepped down from the carriage.
Before them stretched a sea of golden crops, swaying gently in the breeze. Neat rows lined either side of a dirt path that led toward a modest, weatherworn wooden farmhouse nestled in the middle. The land looked tired but tended, like an old soldier still willing to stand watch.

Alex followed closely behind, his eyes scanning the fields with admiration. “Woah… this is way bigger than I imagined. Compared to my garden back home, this place might as well be a province.”

They walked for a few minutes in relative quiet, their boots crunching the edge of the path. Eventually, they spotted a figure hunched over the soil—a man with a long-handled hoe, moving with steady rhythm and practiced ease.

The Emperor was the first to approach, his stride confident but unthreatening.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, good sir,” he greeted. “We heard word you were in need of some assistance on your farm. You must be Charwin Darles, yes?”

The man didn’t turn immediately. Instead, he finished one last swing of the hoe before slowly glancing over his shoulder.
“Watch where you’re stepping,” Charwin said bluntly. “The soil beneath your boots was freshly planted this morning. Don’t ruin my crops before you’ve even earned your keep.”
His voice wasn’t hostile, just honest. The kind of voice shaped by wind, dirt, and decades of stubborn labor. His eyes were sharp but tired. His hands, calloused. And though he stood before emperors and killers, he didn’t bow.
Not out of disrespect, but because the earth didn’t bend, and neither did he.

Seeing this the Emperor just smiled and nodded. “Yes of course, I will be more careful with my steps. We are here to help, not ruin what you’ve built.” he stepped back carefully onto firmer ground.

Charwin leaned on his hoe, eyeing the four of them with a gaze that could strip paint off a barn. “Help, huh? We’ll see. Big talk’s easy. Lifting hay bales ain’t.”
Cillian stepped forward, deadpan. “Point me to the bales.”

Charwin snorted. “Well, at least one of you knows what he’s here for.”

He turned and walked toward the barn. “Follow me. If you're here to help, you’ll earn your keep.”

As the group moved after him, Alex leaned toward the Emperor and whispered, “You know... I never thought he would be so rude, I kind of hoped he would be more welcome, he would at least hear of you right?”

The Emperor’s smile never faltered. “Respect isn’t earned through fame alone,” he said quietly. “But through action as well .”

Charwin handed out tasks with the brisk authority of someone who didn’t care if you were a peasant or a noble, everyone was equal in the dirt.

“You.” He pointed at the Emperor. “You’re on watering duty. Don’t drown the crops.”
The Emperor blinked down at the iron watering can handed to him like it was a sacred relic. “It… has no enchantments.”
Alex stifled a laugh, taking the second can. “It’s called manual labor, my lord. Come, I’ll show you.”
“I have forged alliances between multiple nobles,"" the Emperor spoke confidently as he examined the can, tilting it this way and that.

 “How hard can this be?”

A short distance away, Leo and Cillian were assigned to fortify the collapsed barley fence. The two stood in silence for a while, carrying wooden stakes and planks.
“This is a terrible idea,” Leo finally muttered, trying to hammer a nail in with what looked like excessive violence.

Cillian didn’t look up. “Using a hammer or being here?”
Leo just sigh as he roll his eye
Charwin passed by, chewing on a blade of grass. “Careful there, hunter. You’re hitting that post like it owes you money.”
“It probably does,” Cillian muttered.

 “Everything does.”

Leo, without breaking stride, muttered to his crow Charlotte, “Do you think if I stand perfectly still, they’ll think I’m a scarecrow and leave me alone?”
Charlotte blinked once, unimpressed.
Charwin squinted at the two of them. “ Boy, you look like you’re building a coffin, not a fence.”

“I work with what I know,” Leo replied simply.
Cillian cracked a grin at that. “See, this is why we keep him around. Quality doom to go ratio.”
Charwin rubbed the back of his neck, already regretting his life choices.

 “If the fence collapses again, I’m blaming that damn Cafe!.”
Meanwhile, Alex was watching the Emperor attempt to pour water on a neat row of cabbage sprouts. Attempt being the operative word.

“You don’t pour it on the leaves,” Alex said gently, guiding the spout to the roots. “They drink from the soil, not the sky.”

The Emperor nodded slowly, frowning with regal intensity. “This is humbling.”

Alex laughed. “So it is falling into a compost bin. Which I’ll remind you to avoid.”

“My cabbages!” Charwin reacted as he walked by but upon closer inspection he clapped the Emperor lightly on the back. “Not bad for a noble. You’ve got less pride than most nobles and twice the aim.”

The Emperor, holding the can like a sword now, simply said, “Let it be known, I do not wage war against cabbage.”

Charwin sighed. “As long as you don’t declare war on my goats, we’ll get along just fine.”
From the barn came a bleat followed by a suspicious thud.

“Speaking of goats,” Alex murmured.
“I’ll check on that,” Cillian said, already moving toward the barn.

Seeing Cillian approach the barn, Charwin screams out as he runs at Cillian quickly.
“Where do you think you are going hunter!?”
Cillian startled at the farmer's scream and stopped in track. “What? I just checking the barn”

Despite what Cillian said,  Charwin still stops him from getting into the barn, he seems tense “You will go into the barn then I allow you to understand? This is my land and you have to follow my rule!” 

Leo narrows his eyes, clearly catching on to something strange about the farmer, he can feel Charwin emotion, he is afraid as if he has something to hide. 

The Emperor and Alex also notice something unusual and join near the barn. “What are you hiding in there?” The emperor’s sharp voice asks.

“Nothing- it’s nothing! Just don’t go in the barn” Charwin says, 
In the blink of an eye Cillian pulls out a gun and presses it to the top of Charwin’s head.

 “Speak.”

Charwin looks at the rest, Alex looks a bit nervous, the Emperor looks calm and Leo appears indifferent. 

“Fine, fine. I’ll tell you. Just get the madman off me” Charwin relents. He lifts his hands in a show of surrender. 
With a single nod from the Emperor Cillian lowers his gun and moves away.

“The reason I didn't want you going into the barn is that… well, see for yourself”
And with that, Charwin finally opened the wooden door.

A faint light shimmered out from the room, and faint silhouettes could be seen.
“Don't tell me that's what I think it is” the Emperor said, his curiosity having been swapped with confusion.
Cillian, being the nearest, glanced inside and nearly died.

But not because of any injury or damage.

He nearly died of laughter.

“Your Majesty, the truth is… I have been following your story for the longest time. I teared up, I laughed and I was dumbfounded upon witnessing your entire adventure. From the moment you came to Poster city, I knew one thing: this person will become my Emperor. My deity. My *savior*.”

A few seconds, everything, except the howling wind and the still laughing Cillian who was now crawling on the ground, was still. 
And inside the old barn?

There was a shrine, an altar. Multiple pictures of the Emperor were placed upon it, with many candles to make them visible. Many newspaper articles could be found, every one documenting the rise of the Emperor. Some of the pictures even looked like they had been made secretly! The Emperor drinking coffee, the Emperor going for a walk and even the Emperor looking outside the window, the photographer clearly hidden on one of the neighboring roofs!

“My Emperor, I'm your closest subject! I even decorated everything with rose pedals, and I also began painting a picture of you!”

The picture in question showed the Emperor and Charwin touching each other's index fingers, with clothes being clearly not the highest priority.

“Why did you not show us your real face from the start?” Asked the extremely dumbfounded Emperor.

“Your Majesty, maybe he didn't know how to bring out his emotions of admiration for you” Answered Leo, clearly holding his emotions more in check than Cillian.

“Hahaha you're his idol! I can't believe something so funny would happen in this life! You're his damn idol, your Majesty!” Said Cillian, having to stop himself from dying of laughter.

Alex, being clearly amused but still deciding to not display his emotions, remained still.

“Your subjects are right me lord, you are both my idol and the target of my admiration. Please bless this citizen of yours with your divine might”

Clasping his hands tightly, Charwin begged.
“I…” the Emperor didn't know what to say.
This was the first ever time he didn't know what to say.

In his head, only a single thought formed: wtf is going on.

“I am honored to have such a…. Ahh… devoted subject? I hereby bless both you and your humble farm…. Ehrm… yes, exactly. Oh, and please stop pursuing both your pictures and artworks of me…”

“But why my liege? As your favorite subject, why can't I gain your blessings by making your form become one with my pencil and camera?”

Every team member looked at the Emperor.
“I need to find an excuse or I'm about to have a real stalker problem!” The Emperor thought.
“I found something!”

As everyone gazed and awaited the Emperor’s answer, the Emperor, being in an extremely dire situation, finally found an excuse.

“Thou shall not look directly at God. This is also true for pictures and artworks. I will pardon your heavy mistake, but do not dare to go against divine right again. Also, every subject of mine is worth a lot to me…. even you. So do not proclaim yourself as my closest one. It is an insult to the Empire itself.”

After finishing his sentence, he immediately grabbed Cillian by using magnify and threw him about a hundred meters away. He did this not to harm Cillian, but to escape his coming laughter.

Leo and Alex, both watching this scene unfold, noticed the Emperor staring at them with murderous intent. Both knew that laughing meant the end for them.

Alex immediately composed himself, not even letting out a smirk.

And Leo?

Together with his desire apostle powers, which he strained near their breaking point, he managed to not show any of his feelings on the outside.

This was one of his most difficult and hardest battles yet.

Charwin, completely ignoring the missing Cillian, prostrated himself on the ground.

“Oh great Emperor, I am such a lowly servant, I completely ignored your will! I will better my ways from now on and follow your orders. Thank you!”

Alex looked the Emperor in the eyes and asked “shall we take our leave now, my lord?”
“Yes, we shall. The Empire has a lot of work to do, so we need to get going.”

“If that's your will my liege, so be it"" said the still prostrating Charwin.

“I'll go make the carriage ready” told Leo, directly noticing the feelings of the Emperor.
The three of them got back on the carriage in the same arrangement as before and started riding, leaving Cillian’s horse behind. From above them there is a flash of fire and after a few more seconds the sound of a horse running.
Cillian quickly catches up to the rest and rides beside them.

“So were you really planning to leave me behind? I’m hurt.” Cillian says to Leo who looks like he would rather be anywhere else but here.
“We knew you would catch up” Leo says, not minding Cillian’s dramatics. “Besides, you are not that important”

“Hurtful much” Cillian slows down Gallant slightly to be in pace with the carriage. “Oi! Why did you throw me away? Do you know how annoying it was to fly back here?” 
The Emperor laughs in the carriage while Alex look worried for the hunter after speaking to the Emperor in such a way. 

“That’s what you get for laughing. Or would you rather I make you talk backwards again?”

Silence. 

Cillian doesn’t speak for the rest of the ride. And the group returns to the manor peacefully.

I’d just left home after things got too rough to stay, let’s just say some people think ""tough love"" means breaking more than just your spirit.

I was crashing on a friend’s couch, working two jobs, and failing most of my college classes. One night, after a long shift at this dingy diner, I missed the last bus. My phone was dead, and it had started raining. Like, full movie-scene rain. And of course, I had no umbrella, no hoodie, nothing.

I ducked under the awning of this 24-hour laundromat just to dry off for a bit, hoping maybe I could wait it out or figure something out. That’s when this guy, maybe mid-30s, scruffy beard, wearing scrubs, walked out with a bag of clothes. He looked at me, paused, and just said, “You good?”

I must’ve looked like hell because I just nodded and tried to smile.

Next thing I know, he hands me a spare charger, walks back into the laundromat, and brings out a still-warm hoodie from his load. “Keep it. You look cold,” he said. Then he pulled out his phone, called me an Uber, and said, “You can pay it forward when you’ve got something to give.”

I didn’t even know what to say. I never got his name, and I’ve never seen him since.

But I still have that hoodie. Still wear it on rough days. It reminds me that people, strangers even, can be light when the world feels pitch black.

Anyone else have a moment like that? When a stranger stepped in at just the right time?",4,1753100288.0,story,1,1.0,False

If your crypto trading account feels more like a Vegas weekend than a spreadsheet, you’re doing it wrong.

I’ve YOLO’d into coins because “the chart looked spicy.” I’ve revenge traded after getting stopped out. I once made a 12% gain, thought I was invincible, and gave it all back in 45 minutes trying to chase something called SuperPigToken.

So yeah, I’ve learned the hard way: if you don’t treat your trading account like a business, it will treat you like the customer at a blackjack table. Enthusiastic, optimistic, and ultimately broke.

Every business has structure. There’s a budget, a strategy, targets, and logs. Nobody opens a coffee shop, throws a bunch of beans in the air, and says, “Let’s see what happens.”

But crypto traders do that every day.
No plan. No risk management. No reason other than a green candle and some guy on YouTube whispering “breakout.”

A real trader treats their capital like inventory. You don’t want to waste it on bad setups or trade it emotionally just because you “haven’t won in a while.” That’s like restocking expired milk because you're mad nobody bought it the first time.

Would you invest in a company that doesn't track profits or losses?

No?
Then why run your trades without a journal?

Even a basic spreadsheet with columns like entry/exit price, size, why you entered, what went wrong/right, and how you felt can completely change the way you trade.

Once I started journaling, I realized I wasn't losing because of ""market manipulation."" I was just entering way too early and using size that made me sweat bullets on every red candle.

If you're not tracking, you're not learning, you're just donating.

If you run a business and lose some product in shipping, you don’t freak out and close the shop. You log it. You learn. You tighten the process.

Same with trading. A bad trade doesn’t mean you suck. It just means that, like every business, some investments don’t return as expected. The goal is manageable risk, not perfect outcomes.

High leverage with no stop loss is basically walking into a bank and saying: “I have a great idea, but I need all the money now, and I won’t tell you what I’m doing with it.”

If you're risking 50% of your account on one trade, you’re not trading , you’re spinning a wheel and hoping the ball lands on your number.

Businesses scale up slowly. They invest cautiously. And they definitely don’t burn everything on a hunch.

I’m not saying don’t have fun. Trading is exciting. But if you’re serious about growing your money, you need to stop playing and start operating.

Have a plan. Manage risk. Keep records. Treat your capital with respect. Get better, not luckier.

Because if you don’t take your account seriously, the market will happily take it from you.",13,1753100274.0,CryptoCurrency,8,0.76,False

The little ivory dialled quartz got an outing. It’s worn on green suede as it’s never going near water. It’s simple, elegant and timeless. Oh, time, it does that well too. It’s running about 20s ahead of true, I don’t think I’ve adjusted it since I changed the battery well over a year ago and given it 25 years old I think I’ll allow that. My favourite feature - the polished cap to the second hand. My later GS watches don’t have this and I think they’re lacking for it, something about attention to detail…

I enjoyed it with a salt beef, cheese, gherkin and mustard bagel; plus a long black coffee and a decent book.
