Between the insanity and down right ignorance of this country and our government with their attacks on anyone not a cis white male billionaire, it‚Äôs easy to feel like God has forgotten about you (myself included). But God sometimes doesn‚Äôt make his presence known in thunderous terms. This morning I got coffee from a coffee shop I don‚Äôt normally go to but it was close by to where I was going. Stopped in, got my drink, tipped and left. Once I got settled at home and finished my drink, I noticed the barista drew a smiley face and ‚Äúkeep going‚Äù. I sobbed because I doubt that barista knew it or not, but I needed that. That reassurance that things are hard, your faith is being tested, but keep going. I am with you and I will never leave you.

So next time you‚Äôre out and about, and you feel a subtle breeze and calm or a bird chirps near you, or even a kind gesture from a stranger, know that God is using that scenario to let you know, ‚ÄúI am with you. I am not going anywhere‚Äù. Thank you everyone and have a fantastic Friday ü´∂üèæ",1,1738339549.0,GayChristians,0,0.67,False

I've already tried Lactaid and Fairlife and both still cause me problems.  So after several people saying how much they liked oatmilk, I tried it.  The Oatly brand was by far the best as far as creaminess and looking the closest to actual milk in my tea and coffee.  Unfortunately after drinking a couple cups, awhile later I became bloated and gassy and felt awful the entire night (no diarrhea, just didn not feel well).  So I knew I couldn't drink it, but I didn't want to toss it so I made a few dishes that require milk, and used the oatmilk instead (salmon loaf, muffins, etc).  I figured if it was baked into something it woud be fine.  I've eaten these items over the last 2-3 days and I experienced diarrhea last night and also this morning.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I've just arrived in Vancouver and need to start scouting out places to rent. I'll be here at least two years.
Looking to see if my impressions of the neighborhoods are right/Any thoughts on how Kits vs. Mt. Pleasant stack up?

The sense I get is that Kits might be a little more pretty/calm and Mt. Pleasant a little more active?

What's important to me for a neighborhood:
- Live by myself or a master room with just 1-2 housemates, on a $68k/year gross salary, so like $4200 net/month I think
- Transit to UBC. I will work there full time and expect to join one or two of the sports clubs there. So sometimes even multiple round trips in one day. Trying to avoid >30min one way. 40min is probably near my max. (+Kits?)
- Indie cafes with good coffee and will let me work on my laptop for an hour or two (Both Kits and Mt.P?)
- Hole in the wall good n cheap food (+Mt.P?)
- Venues for shows and music gigs, like divey rock bars, folky pubs, artsy open mics/slams, little weekend festival events, etc (+Mt.P?)
- Decent coverage of grocery stores (Both?)
- Climbing gym (Kits/UBC? Or Mt.P/Hive?)
- Pottery studio (+Mt.P?)
- Some green space, tree lined streets, historic buildings, or something to add some charm when walking around (+Kits?)

About 6am I got out of bed and drew the PIO up, warmed it between my legs while I drank my coffee. Chill. But 7am kept creeping closer and closer.

I was three days into a 12-week course, and frustration was setting in.¬†

Every attempt looked like something a five-year-old would produce.

¬†‚ÄúA giraffe isn‚Äôt a giraffe. It's a collection of simple shapes arranged in a specific pattern. Once you learn to see the shapes, the details become obvious.""¬†

I was sceptical. But for the next 3 weeks, we practised, seeing the shapes. The 2 small circles that would become a head. A triangle shape for the body, a long slim rectangle for the neck.

Slowly, almost magically, my drawings improved. Not because I became better at drawing, but because I learned to recognise the underlying patterns.

Today, I can draw decent cartoons, but I still need reference images. Why? Because I'm not really drawing ‚Äì I'm identifying and reproducing patterns. And it works.

This experience taught me something crucial:¬†**the ability to see patterns changes everything**. And recently, I've realised this same principle applies to something I've struggled with far more than drawing ‚Äì having conversations.

Yesterday, I talked about how practising chicken curry helped me see patterns in social interactions. Today, I want to share what those patterns actually look like ‚Äì because understanding them has completely changed how I approach conversations.

¬†**Reading the Room: The Invisible Structure**

I've discovered that conversations aren't as random as they seem. Just like any other skill, they have underlying patterns and structures. Once you start recognising these patterns, everything becomes clearer.

Here's what I've started noticing:

There's always an opening sequence. Whether it's a smile, a nod, or that universal ""hey"" ‚Äì conversations don't usually start with deep revelations. They begin with small acknowledgements, like getting comfortable in a new space.

Then there's the back-and-forth rhythm. I used to think good conversationalists were people who always knew exactly what to say. Now I realise they're more like skilled negotiators ‚Äì they understand the balance of giving and receiving attention. They know when to speak and when to listen.

¬†

**The Three Stages of Every Conversation**

After weeks of conscious practice, I've noticed most casual conversations follow these distinct stages:

1. **The Connection Point**¬†Every conversation needs that initial spark. Think of it as finding a tiny thread that connects you and the other person. This can happen through:

* **Shared Environment**: ""This coffee shop always has the best pastries""
* **Mutual Experiences**: ""Did you get caught in that rain yesterday?""
* **Obvious Commonalities**: ""Is that a Python coding book? I'm learning Python too""
* **Light Observations**: ""Those plants in the lobby are really thriving""
* **Timely Topics**: ""How are you handling this heat wave?""

The key is that these opening moments don't require deep vulnerability or complex thoughts. They're simple, low-risk conversation starters that establish basic human connection.

1. **The Expansion Phase**¬†This is where conversations begin to breathe and grow naturally. It happens through:

* **Follow-up Questions**: ""What got you interested in Python?""
* **Related Topics**: ""Speaking of coffee shops, have you tried that new place downtown?""
* **Personal Connections**: ""That reminds me of when I lived in Seattle...""
* **Shared Interests**: ""Oh you like hiking too? What trails do you recommend?""
* **Natural Curiosity**: ""That's interesting - how did you figure out that solution?""

The expansion phase works best when you:

* Let each topic naturally lead to the next
* Show genuine interest in their responses
* Share relevant personal experiences
* Look for branches of conversation that could lead somewhere interesting
* Stay flexible about where the conversation might go

¬†

1. **Deepening the Connection**¬†The real magic happens when you learn to take conversations beyond surface level. This third stage is where casual chats can transform into meaningful exchanges:

* **Follow Emotional Cues**: When someone's voice changes or they show extra enthusiasm, that's an invitation to dig deeper. ""It sounds like that project really means a lot to you?""
* **Share Related Experiences**: Not to overshadow their story, but to show understanding. ""I had a similar moment when..."" This creates bridges between experiences.
* **Ask Layer-Down Questions**: Move from what to why to how.
* **First Layer**: ""What made you choose photography?""
* **Second Layer**: ""What is it about street photography that draws you in?""
* **Third Layer**: ""How does capturing those unexpected moments change how you see the world?""
* **Practice Active Curiosity**: Look for the interesting edges of what they're saying. If someone mentions they love their job because it lets them be creative, that's a door to explore what creativity means to them.
* **Use Memory Hooks**: Reference something they said earlier in the conversation. ""You mentioned travelling to Japan earlier ‚Äì how does that experience influence your photography?""

¬†

**When the Pattern Shifts**

But here's what's fascinating: once you understand these patterns, you also start recognising when they change. Like when someone breaks the usual flow to share something personal, or when the energy suddenly shifts because something resonates deeply.

These moments used to throw me off completely. Now I see them as natural variations ‚Äì not disruptions, but opportunities for the conversation to evolve into something more meaningful.

**The Balance of Anxiety and Awareness**

I still get anxious in social situations. But understanding these patterns has given me something concrete to hold onto. When I feel lost, I can look for familiar structures. When I'm not sure what to say, I can follow the natural progression from connection to expansion.

It's like having a map of territory I once thought was completely uncharted. I might still take wrong turns, but at least I know the general layout of the land.

**Looking Ahead: A Safe Space to Practice**

All this pattern recognition is great, but there's still one challenge: how do you practice these skills? Real-world conversations can feel high-stakes, especially when you're still learning. Wouldn't it be amazing if there was a way to practice these patterns in a space where mistakes don't matter? Where you could try different approaches, experiment with responses, and learn from each interaction without the social pressure?

I've been exploring some interesting possibilities lately. Tools and spaces where you can have conversations that feel real but without the anxiety of real-world consequences. Places where you can practice these patterns over and over until they become second nature.

For now, I'm curious: how do you practice your conversation skills? Do you have a safe space where you can experiment and grow? What would your ideal ""conversation practice ground"" look like?",1,1738338264.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False
1iehn3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1iehn3s/3_stoic_practices_that_have_helped_me_build/,3 Stoic Practices that Have Helped Me Build Lasting Gratitude,">""When you wake up in the morning, think what a privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love""  
\- Marcus Aurelius

I've tried all the gratitude practices and hacks that you see commonly touted by wellness gurus on social media. You know the type - Instagram influencers promising 20 minute daily gratitude journaling would ""10x your happiness"", while trying to sell you their $997 masterclass (now just $29 if you ACT FAST!!!).

I was tired of forcing myself to write ""I'm grateful for sunshine"" 10+ times while my brain helpfully reminded me about upcoming bills, that weird noise my car started making, and how I just ran out of coffee. Gratitude felt like homework for happiness that never actually worked. Eventually, I just gave up the practice all together.

Then, like most things, I went back to my roots and explored how the Stoics approached gratitude, and it completely changed my perspective. The Stoics lived during challenging times‚Äîdealing with plagues, wars, and empire-wide chaos. Yet they figured out something about gratitude that most modern wellness gurus completely miss.

And it completely changed my approach to gratitude:

**Stop trying to feel grateful. Start training yourself to see clearly.**

The Stoics didn't treat gratitude like a feel-good exercise. They saw it as a way to face reality head-on.

Using this insight, I adopted 3 daily practices that helped me build lasting gratitude:

**1. The Morning Minute**

Instead of writing a long gratitude list, pick ONE specific thing. Not ""my health"" but ""being able to walk up stairs without knee pain."" Specificity hits different.

**2. The Annoyance Flip**

Turn daily irritations into gratitude triggers:

* Traffic jam ‚Üí More time for your favorite podcast
* Micromanaging boss ‚Üí You're doing work worth paying attention to
* Endless Zoom calls ‚Üí No real pants required

**3. The Evening Replay**

60-second gratitude scan before bed. Find 2-3 specific moments from your day. That stranger's smile counts. That perfect sip of coffee counts. The goal isn't to feel grateful - it's to train your brain to notice these moments automatically.

**Quick Story to Drive this Home**

The Stoics took their gratitude practices seriously. Picture this: Rome's greatest general is having the best day of his life after a successful campaign. He's standing in a golden chariot riding through streets packed with thousands of screaming fans. They're literally throwing flowers at his feet.

But the part most people missed? Right behind him, amid all this glory, stands a slave. And this slave has one job: to lean in and whisper in the general's ear, over and over: ""Memento mori - remember you are mortal.""

Why? Because the Stoics knew something we keep forgetting: Nothing snaps you into genuine gratitude like remembering nothing is guaranteed.

**Results I experienced after switching my approach:**

* Stopped keeping a gratitude journal, but feel more grateful than ever
* Turned daily annoyances into gratitude triggers
* Developed an automatic gratitude radar for small moments
* Haven't missed a day of the practice in months

The biggest realization here? Real gratitude isn't about forcing positive vibes when life sucks. It's about seeing clearly what we have before life decides to show us.

Would love to hear what unexpected things others have found themselves genuinely grateful for once they started really paying attention.",4,1738338233.0,Stoicism,1,1.0,False

The key is that these opening moments don't require deep vulnerability or complex thoughts. They're simple, low-risk conversation starters that establish basic human connection.

1. **The Expansion Phase** This is where conversations begin to breathe and grow naturally. It happens through:

* **Follow-up Questions**: ""What got you interested in Python?""
* **Related Topics**: ""Speaking of coffee shops, have you tried that new place downtown?""
* **Personal Connections**: ""That reminds me of when I lived in Seattle...""
* **Shared Interests**: ""Oh you like hiking too? What trails do you recommend?""
* **Natural Curiosity**: ""That's interesting - how did you figure out that solution?""

The expansion phase works best when you:

* Let each topic naturally lead to the next
* Show genuine interest in their responses
* Share relevant personal experiences
* Look for branches of conversation that could lead somewhere interesting
* Stay flexible about where the conversation might go

¬†

1. **Deepening the Connection** The real magic happens when you learn to take conversations beyond surface level. This third stage is where casual chats can transform into meaningful exchanges:

* **Follow Emotional Cues**: When someone's voice changes or they show extra enthusiasm, that's an invitation to dig deeper. ""It sounds like that project really means a lot to you?""
* **Share Related Experiences**: Not to overshadow their story, but to show understanding. ""I had a similar moment when..."" This creates bridges between experiences.
* **Ask Layer-Down Questions**: Move from what to why to how.
* **First Layer**: ""What made you choose photography?""
* **Second Layer**: ""What is it about street photography that draws you in?""
* **Third Layer**: ""How does capturing those unexpected moments change how you see the world?""
* **Practice Active Curiosity**: Look for the interesting edges of what they're saying. If someone mentions they love their job because it lets them be creative, that's a door to explore what creativity means to them.
* **Use Memory Hooks**: Reference something they said earlier in the conversation. ""You mentioned travelling to Japan earlier ‚Äì how does that experience influence your photography?""

¬†

**When the Pattern Shifts**

But here's what's fascinating: once you understand these patterns, you also start recognising when they change. Like when someone breaks the usual flow to share something personal, or when the energy suddenly shifts because something resonates deeply.

These moments used to throw me off completely. Now I see them as natural variations ‚Äì not disruptions, but opportunities for the conversation to evolve into something more meaningful.

**The Balance of Anxiety and Awareness**

I still get anxious in social situations. But understanding these patterns has given me something concrete to hold onto. When I feel lost, I can look for familiar structures. When I'm not sure what to say, I can follow the natural progression from connection to expansion.

It's like having a map of territory I once thought was completely uncharted. I might still take wrong turns, but at least I know the general layout of the land.

**Looking Ahead: A Safe Space to Practice**

All this pattern recognition is great, but there's still one challenge: how do you practice these skills? Real-world conversations can feel high-stakes, especially when you're still learning. Wouldn't it be amazing if there was a way to practice these patterns in a space where mistakes don't matter? Where you could try different approaches, experiment with responses, and learn from each interaction without the social pressure?

I've been exploring some interesting possibilities lately. Tools and spaces where you can have conversations that feel real but without the anxiety of real-world consequences. Places where you can practice these patterns over and over until they become second nature.

For now, I'm curious: how do you practice your conversation skills? Do you have a safe space where you can experiment and grow? What would your ideal ""conversation practice ground"" look like?",1,1738338213.0,communicationskills,0,1.0,False

I smell things strongly and I can also be intolerant to any particular smell. When this happens I mostly get asthma like symptoms or I can get nauseous. This can be smells from detergent, fragrances, some plastics, cardboard, metal, oil, gas, etc. Even some foods that have too much seasonings like taco meat, meat sauce (tomato), etc. I could handle most coffee smells surprisingly (I do not drink coffee) but if I‚Äôm smelling it for too long and potently it may start to bother me. 

All this started back in late January 2020. It was a couple months after I started having my GERD (chronic acid reflux) flare and literally right after I was recovering from some kind of viral sickness (felt like the flu but not sure if it was actually Covid because the first case of Covid wasn‚Äôt confirmed in NYC yet). I also had to abruptly stop breastfeeding my baby after 17 months because I wanted to try different medications for my GERD. I mention this because I always wondered if it was a hormonal imbalance. I had that smell sensitivity as if I was a pregnant woman. I also do have digestive issues including H pylori.

Please guys, I‚Äôm desperate for answers. My livelihood has diminished. I can‚Äôt be around others. Had to quit my job at a hospital after working with them for 13 years. I have no quality of life. I‚Äôm a wife and mom too. Can‚Äôt even cook anymore because of the smell. There is one clue, when I was taking a women‚Äôs multivitamin gummy I did so much better all around. Little to no anxiety, I could tolerate smells a bit more, digestive issues were tolerable but still there. I stopped the multi for other side effects I was having with it but never found anything to replace it. Somebody please help.

It‚Äôs from 2021 so Vicki must be past 6 years sober now. To those of us who have left the cult, we are out there and we are legion. Never stop questioning and listen to your own inner wisdom. 

Someone who transitioned from AA to life:

I'm a 56 yr old female. I started going to AA after being court ordered for my 2nd DUI. I was also sentenced to a year probation which means no drinking while on probation. I went to meetings that first year 5 to 7 times a week. Even after I was released from probation I went to meetings.

AA is very structured. Meaning do what they tell you to do. Get a sponsor, call your sponsor everyday, work the steps, dont date your first year,  be of service to AA.  Service to AA implies you give back by chairing meetings, making coffee, clean up after meetings, giving people rides, being secretary to your home group, giving the lead at lead meetings etc. And eventually getting your first sponsee.

But lets get back to the biggie. Working the steps. Basically it falls on Gods hands. Only God has the power to relieve you of your addiction. Each step focuses on the power of God and giving your will up and placing it in Gods hands. And that was my first struggle. But i gave it a shot anyway. I did everything that was asked of me even when i didnt believe one bit of what they asked of me. I preformed to their standards for 2 years.
Till i started asking questions, questions the challenged the AA principles. Questions the AA robots couldn't answer. Sitting in meetings started depressing me. Is this what my life is going to be like? For the rest of my life? 

I dropped to 2 meetings a week. I started volunteering at a farm animal rescue a couple evenings a week which eventually lead to every Saturday mornings  as well. I still had my regular day job which meant i couldnt volunteer days. Farm work is hard work. Phyiscal work and its not always sunny and 70. The animals need fed, watered and cared for. This means getting up at 5 am on a Saturday when its -10 F. Or working when its 105 F in August. It means waking up at 2 am when you‚Äôre on call. To chase down a pig and bring that pig to safety. Our sanctuary rescues criminally abused farm animals that suffer from humans consuming animals. This became my passion. This was my life now. Eventually volunteers hours turned into a paying part time gig. Which turned into fulltime as the doctor I was working for retired. I started hiking and joined hiking clubs which turned into hiking trips out west, weekend camping trips. 

I was struggling to even make 1 meeting a week.  The AA robots started asking where I was. Telling me without AA I would relapse. And that anyone who leaves the program will surely end up dead or in jail. They couldn t understand that there is more than one way to stay sober. I told them I was no longer part of AA as I decided to leave the program.The AA robots said I shouldn‚Äôt be making any decisions without first calling my sponsor and praying about it.

AA is fine for some people. People that like to live their lives in square little boxes and never leave the box. I couldnt grow as a person stuck in the one box fits all rules of AA. I also cant live my life based on others judgements or opinions of me. Other people dont get to validate my worth. I also cant live in the past. I dont look behind me cause I am not living there. Sitting in a church basement 4 nites a week saying, ""Hi I‚Äôm Vicky, I‚Äôm an alcoholic "" does nothing to keep me sober.

Feels like there's a bit of a stigma in Ireland around the ""American"" approach of just going up to somebody you like and asking them to go for a coffee etc. I say that because I don't know a single person who has done that, or anybody who's been on the other end and not turned around saying how embarrassing it was.

1iehjz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1iehjz7/coffee_shop_pricing_strategies_for_food/,Coffee shop pricing strategies for food,"Hello team. I have owned my coffee shop for 5 years as of today. I am really proud of that accomplishment. Although I have done a lot to update pricing strategies over the years, I have a huge remodel coming up and after we open back up, I really want to use it as an opportunity for a reset in pricing strategy. 4 out of 6 of our full time girls have been with me for 4 years or more. I no longer work in my coffee shop and continue to build opportunities with the business -  not just in the business, and it is because of their dedication to our community.

I want the opportunity to be a healthy business while also focusing on increasing benefits and value of employment with me so they feel appreciated for their loyalty and do not become complacent or stagnant. All of these things obviously come at a cost. I have 2 questions rolled into one. 

1) Previously I have priced my menu using blanket averages. The average hot drink and iced drink cost x to produce, divided by 20% which equals 5.45 for the normal hot and iced drinks. This means that lattes, cappuccino, Americanos, and chai were priced the same to avoid guest confusion. This is the first thing I am seeking feedback on. Is this a sufficient model or should I price each drink as it's own consideration. Obviously modifiers, extras, and blended drinks all cost differently. Even so, I'm not sure it's fair to the Americano person that they essentially subsidize the latte person, although sales have been very consistent and do not show signs of fear of pricing strategy. If anyone has feedback for me here I'd love to hear it.

2) food pricing and pastry pricing. I used supply and demand modeling for food. Popular items like our bacon double egg and cheese on a bagel would be priced at 30 - 35% COG. Pastries, which are delivered pre packaged at our shop and warmed up to go, are priced at 60% COG because it's really just an additional hand held that I am trying to push ticket sale averages with. Food that wasn't in high demand or that we offered to get people in the door, I would price at 50% COG. 

I have worked a delicate balance to keep a gross profit margin of no less than 60% average across all items sold in a given month.

As I begin to expand my horizons, I wanted to get peoples thoughts on lowering my COG formula for food and pastries to be more profitable and whether in your opinion, if it would affect my net customer count by turning away people who would have otherwise bought something with their high profit drink. 

Rather than drinks subsidizing food and pastries, and certain drinks subsidizing other drinks, I am considering maintaining a high profit on drinks while also reducing my COG % formula which will increase food and pastry prices, but i do not want to do it at the expense of my guests leaving or not buying. 

Please consider in your reply that even a 5% move down in COG pricing formula can often add any where from 1 dollar to 2.25 extra to the cost of a product in my shop.

Has anyone done something similar and had success or failure?

So I (F20) have a ""friend"" (M19) who will from now on be known as ""B"".

B and I went to middle school together. We graduated almost 4 years ago. We were classmates for 3 years becausse I had transferred to his school. In beginning we talked quite a bit, and being teenagers, we started flirting a bit. That being said, none of us had any experience whatsoever. 

In the first we mostly just talked. We were boyfriend and girlfriend but really we were just friends with titles. Anyway, sometimes we would push boundaries. He insisted that we she kiss, I thought it would be fine so I agreed. Next thing I know B's tongue was down my throat (NOT SEXY) and I didn't know what to do. 

Another time we were at my place watching Ratatouille (great movie), and we were lying on my bed. He then asks if he can touch my boobs. Mind you this is in the middle of the movie. I say something along the lines of ""all right"". The rest of the movie he has his hand under my shirt... just... cupping my boob. Again not sexy.

Anyway we broke up. He dated my best friend. They broke up. We got back together (Not very classy, I know, but she forgave me). We broke up again. We graduated. I thought I would never see him again. 

Was I upset? No.

A few years later when I am kneedeep in studies, while  juggling having moved out of my parents house, he texts me one day out of the blue. 

I think about not responding but hey what could possibly go wrong? Everything. We talk, we make up. We both acknowledge that we were young and stupid and made mistake. We agree to be friends. Good start right? Anyway, soon he starts asking me if I have boyfriend. I value honesty so I say no. The he brings up how he has had a lot bad relationships but that ours wasn't one of them... Meanwhile I'm wondering if he's trying to get back together? Which I am not the least bit interrested in. I was barely interrested in being friends.

But B, was about as good at taking hints as a wet rock (If it isn't clear, he was very bad). He would text me often. Not once in a while... Every other week... no no, he texted every. single. day.

Now, you don't know me, but I am a person, who needs a lot of space. If I never had to make connection with another human being again I would not be upset.

 I tried seeming uninterrested (one-worded answers and such), I tried just not replying... But nothing worked. In the end I sent him the following message (Btw the cursing was an attempt to make it lighthearted and funny): ""Listen, I know we agreed to be friends, but not friends who text every freaking (not freaking...) day! Chill!""

You might be thinking, ""girl, that... was maybe a little much."" In that case I would agree. I am very much ashamed of it, but I had reached my limit, and all other ways didn't seem to get through to him. I have felt horrible about it ever since, but I can't change the past.

Anyway, take a deep breath, because that was just the backstory... so flash forward about 1,5 year...

Now a bit more than a week ago, I was on a train. Suddenly a man stood next to me and stared at me. I was staring at the floor like I always do. But I felt him staring at me, so I looked up and wouldn't you know it? It's B. He waves. I wave. He gets off the train. I think to myself ""I hope he doesn't text me"".

Soon after he does. He starts his charade with how sorry he is, and how he made a lot mistakes. You smart people out there, might be sensing a pattern. This guy would always talk about ALL the many mistakes he made in the past.... and learn NOTHING from them.

One of the things he said he was sorry about was texting too much...

We talk for a bit, catch up. Soon enough he asks if I have a boyfriend. A lot of things have changed over the years, but me appreciating honesty, isn't one of them. So I tell him that I don't. In fact I haven't ever since we broke up like 5 years ago. 

He says that he had a girl who dumped him like a month prior. I make my best Zuko impression (if you that refrence you're awesome, and if you don't... that's okay, you're still awesome), telling him that I'm sorry to hear that. He goes on to say, that he doesn't have any friends, and that he has pretty much given up on connecting to people...

Okay dude...

But I tough it out. I say to myself that I can listen to him for a couple hours, make him feel less alone... He asks out for coffee(!!!), I don't drink coffee, but I do drink tea. He changes it to tea. He recently bought a new car. He offers to take me for a ride sometime....

Like I said I don't have a lot of experience, but to me that sounds like not one, but TWO dates. 

I'm like ""sure."". Because I might be connecting things that don't really connect. idk.

Back to the other main problem. I can deal with him feeling sorry for himself, I can deal with the maybe flirting, but! I cannot deal with him! texting!! every!!! single!!!! day!!!!!

I get so stressed. I can't tell you why, I don't know. But I get so stressed that I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't function. 

He told me that he had plans today (friday) with his friend. Cool. This morning he texted that his friend had cancelled. Sucks to be you. Then he off-handedly mentions that ""Now I need to find a place to sleep tonight LOL"". I always try to help people.... but like I said, I moved out... I live alone.... I'm not saying something would/could happen.... 

I didn't even offer. I just told him that I hoped he could figure something out otherwise he had to find a bench somewhere (again trying to make it lighthearted). Suddenly he had plenty of options!!! His mother (whom he has always made a point of saying never liked me?? Okay???)!! His other friend who lives in the area! etc. 

Again I don't know if I am imagining things, but knowing this guy... Years ago before we graduated I told that he needed to figure out if he could friends with a girl, without trying to get her pants. 

I stand by this. Obviously, he hasn't changed. He still asks about my love life (he got oddly specific this time), he still makes a pity party for himself, he still insinuates stuff, and he still texts every day even though I told him EXPLICITLY that I couldn't handle it. 

Honestly I don't know what to do. 

I know the right thing, would be, to talk to him and explain my feelings in a good way. But I have no clue how to do it without minimizing it or without him making me feel bad. (He has done a lot of guilt tripping in the past).

I am just so done. I wish I could just block him or ghost him, but I know that isn't right. We're both adults now... we're supposed to act like it... What do I do?

Ps. sorry about grammar, english isn't my first language. If it was I would give you the messages directly lol.   ",1,1738337799.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Be Prepared for Western European Prices,"# Thinking of Moving to Buenos Aires as a Digital Nomad? Be Prepared for Western European Prices

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a **realistic** take on the cost of living in Buenos Aires for digital nomads. If you‚Äôve seen outdated blog posts or YouTube videos saying it‚Äôs a cheap paradise, **that‚Äôs no longer the case.** Prices here are now **on par with Western Europe**, and in some cases, even higher.

Here are some real-world price examples:

üí∞ **Everyday Expenses**

* **Gym (nice, but not luxury):** **‚Ç¨70-90/month** (and many exclude pool access, which costs **‚Ç¨20+ extra**).
* **Yogurt (small cup):** **‚Ç¨1.50 to ‚Ç¨3**.
* **Long-life milk (1L, cheapest option):** **‚Ç¨1.40**.
* **Local pasta brands (500g):** **‚Ç¨1-2**, but if you want **Barilla or another global brand: ‚Ç¨6-8**.
* **Chicken breast (per kg):** **‚Ç¨13**, while in **Barcelona, Lidl sells it for ‚Ç¨6-7/kg**.
* **Coffee in a random caf√©:** **‚Ç¨3+, often reaching ‚Ç¨4-5**.
* **Beer in many neighbourhoods (not just Palermo):** **‚Ç¨6-7** for 0.5L.
* **Pizza or a simple Italian dish:** **‚Ç¨14-20** just for a main course.
* **Breakfast ""offers"" (coffee + sandwich) at places like Havanna:** **‚Ç¨10**.
* **Empanada at a ‚Äúmercado‚Äù in a less premium zone:** **‚Ç¨3 per piece**. **Small quiche:** **‚Ç¨10+**.

üçî **Eating Out**

* The best price-to-quality ratio is probably for **burgers**, as **beef remains reasonably priced**. But even then, a **burger with a side will still cost around ‚Ç¨10**, which is fair but **not ""cheap""**.

üè† **Rentals**

* You **can** find a decent 1-bedroom apartment in **Palermo** (in a building with no extra amenities) for **$800-1000 USD**, but you‚Äôll need **luck and negotiation skills**.
* If you‚Äôre not careful, **landlords will push for $1200+ USD (incl. expenses)** for a **decent but not luxury** studio or 1-bedroom in a good area (via AirBnb).

üõí **There‚Äôs No Real ""Budget"" Shopping Option**  
Unlike in many other countries, you can‚Äôt save much by shopping at smaller stores or ""budget"" supermarket chains. These prices aren‚Äôt from some high-end **luxury supermarket**‚Äîthey‚Äôre from a mix of **Disco, D√≠a, Carrefour, and Chinese corner shops**. No matter where you go, **prices are more or less the same**, so you don‚Äôt get the usual advantage of finding cheaper alternatives by shopping in local markets or discount stores.

üí° **The Bottom Line**  
The *blue dollar* rate still exists, but landlords and businesses have adjusted their pricing, so don‚Äôt expect a **low-cost lifestyle** just because you earn in USD. Difference between an official blue dollar rate is as per today and what my card provider charges me is around 15% (Revolut exchange rate 1081 pesos for 1 EUR vs 1250 pesos the unofficial rate.

I‚Äôve been living in **Barcelona for the past few years**, and while prices there have also risen, at least you **get premium products and services for the price you pay**. Here in Buenos Aires, you can live a **decent** life, but **nowhere close to a luxury lifestyle** while paying similar amounts to Barcelona.

**Buenos Aires is still an amazing city**‚Äîgreat energy, nightlife, and culture‚Äîbut if you‚Äôre coming here expecting to save money, **think twice**. There are better options in South America if affordability is a top priority.

Would love to hear from others currently living here‚Äîhow are you finding the cost of living lately?",7,1738337749.0,digitalnomad,24,0.89,False

1. How much caffeine am I getting from my Argentinian mate if I fill my gourd 2/3 full and drink it, say, 5 times total with refills? (I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs high)

2. People mentioned caffeine will be less of a spike because you can keep refilling and drink over a couple of hours, but I usually have some quiet time before work/school and have mate, but I have to do it in one sitting then leave. Even on weekend, I‚Äôm tethered to the tea kettle to keep refilling it. If I brought mate to my desk I‚Äôd have to keep getting up and stuff to refill, so I don‚Äôt understand what people are doing  

3. This is my first mate bag, I‚Äôve been using Argentinian mate and it doesn‚Äôt form the mountain as well. Some have said it doesn‚Äôt matter, some still say to try. What do?
And should I still wet the leaves and let them soak/expand for a few minutes before I add my hot drinking water? Some also say with Argentinian to not soak and just pour right in, but I don‚Äôt enjoy excessive mate bits in my straw. 

4. I‚Äôve been using cold water to soak the mate filling up just below the top of mate, but when I then pour and have first drink I‚Äôm getting that cold water through my straw. I then tried water the same temp as drinking water, poured up below mate top, and let soak, but then my first drink was very bitter because it had just been sitting there. So what‚Äôs ideal?  

5. This is my first experience with mate and I‚Äôm enjoying it. Coffee hurts my stomach and this is much better. Caffeine can still bother sometimes but it seems improved, and the taste is really refreshing and I enjoy the ritual.  
My point: do you guys recommend or prefer Argentinian or Brazilian mate? (These are the two main ones I think?) mountain would be cool but I hear it‚Äôs more bitter?

I‚Äôve been brewing on a Hario Switch 03. I mostly use it as a one-cup immersion brewer ‚Äî doing a short bloom, filling it up to my final desired liquid amount, and letting it steep for however long is ideal for the coffee I‚Äôm brewing. 

I‚Äôve really enjoyed the results I get with this method, even with some pretty funky coffees, but I‚Äôm cognizant of the fact that some particularly delicate/floral coffees may lose some nuance with this method and be better suited to a traditional pour over approach. Of course, I could just open the switch on my Switch and treat it like a pour over, but the 03 is HUGE for a one-cup traditional brew and feels a little awkward to use for that reason. 

This has made me wonder a few things:
- Whether getting a smaller V60 (02 or more likely an 01) might be worthwhile.
- Whether going for a high-bypass brewer like the Origami to get the most ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù brew possible from an immersion brew on the Switch would be worthwhile.
- Whether different filters aimed toward a brighter, juicer cup would be more impactful than either of the above approaches.

I was so stoked because I was excited about this friendship and the trip, but things turned sour pretty quickly.

I stayed with them the night before for ease and I needed to grab a few things before heading out, primarily coffee. I really love coffee and wanted to get some good beans to have for the trip. 

They were running to the store on their way out and offered to pick it up- awesome!

So we head out in separate cars to our destination. They told me they‚Äôd give me the address but didn‚Äôt give it to me until I was nearly to the town we were going to. I knew the general direction, but not the exact address and service was spotty etc. i just felt like they could‚Äôve given it to me when I asked them for it, before we left their house. But it didn‚Äôt seem like a big deal. 

Then we get to the house and they didn‚Äôt get coffee. I was pretty bummed because I was going to go get it myself prior to leaving and they insisted and offered. It was one of those situations where they offered and I said no and they offered again and I said no and they offered again I finally said yes. 

I was able to go to a store and get some but it wasn‚Äôt the coffee I wanted. Again, not a big deal but it would‚Äôve been avoided if I had just gotten it myself.  

So two really small things that have kind of just put a slight damper on my mood, but to me they show a lack of care or concern. If I was in their shoes, inviting my friends on a trip and offering to pick up stuff for them, I would A. Make sure they had everything they needed (directions etc) and B. I wouldn‚Äôt forget the thing I offered to grab for them. 

But the next day shit kind of hit the fan.

We were going on a hike and I went to go get some stuff out of my car when I noticed my car lock had broken. The slot where you put the key in was off kilter and I couldn‚Äôt unlock the car. Huge issue to have when you‚Äôre 4 hours from home in the desert on the weekend and you have to leave the next day. 

So I let them know what‚Äôs happened and get on my phone with insurance to get a locksmith. As these things go it took a while to get ahold of people and be out on hold and get numbers and schedule the appointment etc.

All while this is happening my friends are waiting for me and at one point one of them comes up to me and asks what‚Äôs going on etc and I don‚Äôt remember exactly what they said but they pointed out that this is a huge inconvenience for them and it‚Äôs going to get dark soon so we‚Äôre wasting light for our hike etc. 

Like they had no concern about what was essentially an emergency for me because I became temporarily trapped in the desert without a vehicle. 

That really pissed me off because it felt like one inconsiderate act after another.

Finally I get everything sorted out and we go on the hike.

We all took a very small amount of mushrooms, which I never do, and that turned out to be a bad idea because I started to have a panic attack because of it. I was doing my best to stay calm and keep it together but after a while I felt I needed to go back home. 

I brought this up to them and the same person who told me my car breaking down was inconveniencing them said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not leaving, we came here to do this‚Äù. 

Like no consideration at all. 

So I just went back to the car and waited for them, and because they had way more shrooms than I did, and on the way out to the hike they were driving like a maniac, I took it upon myself to drive us back. 

We had planned to get food on the way back but we hadn‚Äôt planned exactly where etc and on the way back someone said something about stopping somewhere and another person said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to eat there too‚Äù but it wasn‚Äôt clear to me that they wanted to do that at that exact moment, like they were talking amongst themselves- no one explicitly asked or told me to stop at this place- so I drove us back to the house and when we got there they left to go get food by themselves and I was kind of taken aback and they said ‚Äúwe asked you to stop‚Äù and I said ‚Äúno you didn‚Äôt‚Äù and the whole yes we did, no you didn‚Äôt thing went back and forth for a minute.

Anyways, I was super pissed because the whole weekend, to me, had turned to shit and I felt like they were very inconsiderate of my needs or just the general situation. 

So the next morning comes and because I felt like I had tried to communicate with them and they were unreceptive, I was so angry so couldn‚Äôt talk to them anymore, and then they were all pissed because I was giving them the ‚Äúsilent treatment‚Äù. I just felt like there were irreconcilable differences between us. 

I got my car unlocked, packed my stuff and left without saying a word. 

Anyways, I‚Äôve decided to cut contact with them because to me they were just very inconsiderate and kind of selfish, like the entire weekend was about them regardless of what situations popped up or if someone else needed something.

Also please send an imgur.com link with a picture (I prefer non-smiling - smiles tend to conceal). And write to me about you - the more personal the better, and rambling is fine. I will send a pic with my response. I will also let you know whether I think there is potential for attraction (at least on my part).

Does that sound like something you might be interested in exploring? If so, I look forward to hearing from you. If we're both feeling it, we can meet for a walk/chat/coffee/tea and see what the vibe is. Again, I don't do hookups and I don't go straight to the physical. A mental and emotional connection first creates attraction for me.

Btw, I'm attractive enough (nothing earth-shattering, but I look good, esp for a mature woman). I'm kind of short, blondish/brown wavy hair, green eyes, relatively fit build.

I tend to be attracted to the mental and emotional aspects of a person and like men who are intelligent, gentle and thoughtful (nerds, introverts and overthinkers welcome). No cheaters please, and no 'older woman' fetishists - the connection is about who we are as people, not some category we happen to be in.

Sending good vibes to whoever reads this. I wish you blessings and only good things on your journey in life - the right connection is not easy to find and the path can be lonely at times.Chat is enabled, but please share about yourself in your chat request. You can also send a face pic in chat (even before I accept the invite) by using the imgur.com website and pasting a link - I'll do the same in return. Most importantly, I'd like to hear about you.

Please - I'm repeating b/c I've had so many negative experiences - please be someone who is willing to get to know each other on a mental and emotional level first, without feeling entitled to rush to the physical. I need to build a connection over time to be truly physically attracted to someone. Thanks for reading this.",3,1738337294.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Is there a good specialty light-medium drip coffee pouches / bags you can suggest from US based roasters? 
They are hugely popular in Eastern Europe where I am from, but looks like not so much here. I found them only in 1 specialty coffee shop so far (here is the link it‚Äôs Picacho based out of NM https://picacho.coffee/collections/exotics/products/single-serve-coffee-pouch). Those are great but I‚Äôd like to see if there are any other options y‚Äôall would recommend.
I understand the quality of the cup is lower than espresso or a v60, however sometimes I have to be at work at 5am but I‚Äôd still like a good specialty coffee without actually having to think about brewing it.

I liked it and started getting experimental with it, and the only thing I own currently that‚Äôs good with it is kahlua (a coffee liquer that has alcohol).  I only add a half ounce of it as I only want the flavoring of it, not the alcoholic taste or effect.

I mentioned very off handed in a conversation with my friend that I add this to the coffee a bit over a week ago.  Come this weekend, he tells me he wants to try the coffee.  I brew it the way I said I do adding only a half ounce of the kahlua and put it in a thermos for him to try while we drive around and play pokemon go.  I take some sips of it too (yes I know it‚Äôs bad, but it‚Äôs such a small amount there is no way I‚Äôd be even remotely inebriated or impaired).

The very next day, we get to talking and I mention again about brewing it and the kahlua, turns out he didn‚Äôt recall me saying that (can‚Äôt blame him honestly as I said it I off handed) and wasn‚Äôt aware he was drinking alcohol, albeit a very small amount.  He explained to me not only that but also he was abstaining completely from alcohol, which I knew he said he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt drink‚Äù before, but I wasn‚Äôt aware he‚Äôs completely abstaining as I‚Äôve seen him drink before, albeit it was a long time ago.

I apologize to him profusely and explain that I thought he knew and I wasn‚Äôt aware of his abstinence of alcohol and I should have said it again that night.  He however is not forgiving me, and in fact is thinking I‚Äôm somehow justifying my actions.  Not only that, he claims I put our lives in danger as to him, having any amount of alcohol in a drink while driving, whether or not it could inebriate, is all the same.  And he says I need to seek professional help, despite me saying it was wrong to do and basically a huge misunderstanding.

Now come today, he told our mutual friend he‚Äôs thinking about filing a police report against me for the open container.  He screenshotted our Snapchat conversations discussing this where I did admit to putting alcohol in the drink.  If he did present this to the police, would this be sufficient to charge me for open container?

In fact, small, consistent changes can lead to significant improvements in your overall well-being. Whether you're looking to boost your energy, improve your mood, or simply feel better in your own skin, these 10 simple habits can help you create a healthier, happier life.

# 1.¬†Start Your Day with Hydration

Before reaching for that cup of coffee, drink a glass of water. After hours of sleep, your body is dehydrated, and re-hydrating kick-starts your metabolism, flushes out toxins, and boosts mental clarity. Add a slice of lemon for an extra dose of vitamin C and alkalizing benefits.

# 2.¬†Prioritize Whole, Nutrient-Dense Foods

Fill your plate with colorful fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. These foods provide essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support your immune system, energy levels, and long-term health. Limit processed foods and added sugars to avoid energy crashes and inflammation.

# 3.¬†Move Your Body Daily

Exercise doesn‚Äôt have to mean hours at the gym. Find activities you enjoy, whether it‚Äôs yoga, walking, dancing, or cycling. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week. Regular movement improves cardiovascular health, strengthens muscles, and releases endorphins that boost your mood.

4.¬†**Practice Mindful Eating**

Slow down and savor your meals. Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues, and avoid distractions like TV or smartphones while eating. Mindful eating helps you enjoy your food more, prevents overeating, and improves digestion.

# 5.¬†Get Quality Sleep

Sleep is the foundation of good health. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Create a relaxing bedtime routine, limit screen time before bed, and keep your bedroom cool and dark. Proper sleep supports mental clarity, emotional balance, and physical recovery.

# 6.¬†Manage Stress Effectively

Chronic stress can take a toll on your health. Incorporate stress-relief practices like meditation, deep breathing, journaling, or spending time in nature. Even a few minutes of mindfulness each day can help you feel more centered and resilient.

# 7.¬†Stay Connected with Loved Ones

Strong social connections are vital for emotional well-being. Make time for friends and family, whether it‚Äôs a phone call, a coffee date, or a shared activity. Positive relationships reduce stress, boost happiness, and provide a sense of belonging.

# 8.¬†Limit Screen Time

Excessive screen time, especially on social media, can lead to eye strain, poor posture, and mental fatigue. Set boundaries by scheduling screen-free periods during the day and engaging in offline activities like reading, cooking, or spending time outdoors.

# 9.¬†Practice Gratitude

Take a moment each day to reflect on what you‚Äôre grateful for. Gratitude shifts your focus from what‚Äôs lacking to what‚Äôs abundant in your life, fostering positivity and reducing stress. Consider keeping a gratitude journal to track your thoughts.

# 10.¬†Listen to Your Body

Your body is your best guide. Pay attention to how different foods, activities, and habits make you feel. Adjust your routine based on what works best for you, and don‚Äôt be afraid to seek professional guidance when needed.

# Final Thoughts:

A healthy lifestyle is about balance, not perfection. By incorporating these simple habits into your daily routine, you can create a sustainable approach to wellness that enhances your physical, mental, and emotional health. Remember, small steps lead to big changes‚Äîstart today and celebrate every positive choice you make!

I had a girlfriend with whom I was together for 9 years, but she left me out of nowhere. While we were together, she emotionally betrayed me five times. When I asked why it happened, she said that I didn't give her enough attention. After leaving me, the very next day, she met up with a guy about whom she had always told me not to worry. Even tho she said, that hes not her type, and she only like him as a friend. However, she still kept texting me and even invited me out for coffee a couple of times.

After a few months, she suggested that we try again. She said that hes scary, since he was waiting everyday before and after her job near her car in parking lot for a talk. I told her that if we were to give it another shot, she had to be open with me and stop hiding things. (For example, she knew that I was against smoking, yet she had secretly been vaping for the past two years.) But that same guy kept calling and texting her. I asked her to cut off all contact with him because it made me feel bad, but she said she couldn't because he was her work client.

The next day, I took her on a skiing trip. After a week of traveling, we returned and started looking for another four-day trip, since we both had time off. Just then, that guy called her, and she quickly hid her phone. That made me feel terrible, so I told her to stop looking for trips, took her home, and left.

Later, she texted me and said that by doing this, I had closed the door on her, making me the one to blame in this whole situation.

And on the other day, i saw her riding his car.

Expense: $6,000.00  
Net Profit; $1,500.00  
Hours worked: 130 hours

well..my parents told me to close the shop for the rest of the month to restructure. So let's talk about something else this month. I‚Äôll try to write some questions people ask this month and list it here so it doesn‚Äôt get kept asked in the DM.¬†

**Are you gonna take legal action against the shop?**

No, that would serve no purpose. you don‚Äôt sue to win, you sue to get money. Nothing good can come out of this situation. As Koreans say, ‚Äú you avoid shit b/c it's dirty, not because it's dangerous.‚Äù¬†¬†

**Is there a specific reason why he‚Äôs not willing to help?**

Boba boss‚Äô main speciality is to grow and sell it. So let's say you can sell the company for 3x the sales. If all of his shops sell $100 a year. He can get $300 per store. But my shop only performs $50 a year, then he can only get $150 instead of $300. So he no longer wants anything to do with us. (Not paying franchise fee or the royalty didn‚Äôt really help the cause either.)

**What are you going to do now?**¬†

As always, I will do my best till the very end. My parents were furious at how this turned out but as for me, I'm going to keep at it. I do have some of their stocks for 2-3 months, so I‚Äôll just use those and later change to a new design.¬†

**Jojo. I like your stories, any interest in taking it further and making youtube or etc.**

No. The last thing the world needs is a half baked newsletter, e-book, courses, youtuber, tiktoker. And I can only speak for myself but, remaining anonymous is one of the best things in this world. Considering how this boba shop turned around‚Ä¶i guess it was the right move.¬†¬†

**Focus. A singular point**

I still haven‚Äôt figured out how to expand or find a good way to summarize things I learned. fThe Format of reddit makes it so easy to troll since I can‚Äôt write 100 pages to give examples, evidence, etc. So instead of the shotgun approach, I‚Äôll try to make it more singular.

This month, I'll talk about what I get asked most about cafe shops. How do you buy one?¬†  


‚Äî---------------------------------



**Whose advice is better? The doctor or the trainer?**

If I am getting surgery, I want the best doctor possible. If I was trying to lose weight, would I listen to the doctor or the trainer? I listen to the trainer even if his knowledge isn‚Äôt 100% scientific. Because I firmly believe the paper gap theory and those who have crossed the line know better even if it doesn‚Äôt make logical sense. The world doesn‚Äôt move through logic, but through emotions.¬†

I‚Äôll discuss how to buy a turn key cafe (buying from someone else) rather than building from scratch. Because my experience is on turnkey cafe, not an empty key. My ideas have weight in the things I experience. I don‚Äôt know how much it is to set up a table,¬† lighting cost, or building it from scratch. I only talk about what I know .mSo here it goes.¬†

**How much should I pay for a cafe?**

google ‚Äúcafe shop for sale‚Äù or go visit bizbullsell, loopnet, crexi etc‚Ä¶it will be listed like this

Asking Price: $280,000  
Gross Revenue:¬† $250,000

**How would you build a basketball team?**¬†

Why does it only list two factors? How do you calculate the margin? Expense? Cash flow? Profit? Ok. Since not everybody is versed in purchasing. I‚Äôll describe it in a way that makes sense to everyone.¬†

Let's say you are building a local basketball team. You don‚Äôt have money to borrow a gym to test out everyone‚Äôs skill or the time to go through everyone and set up a phone interview, or visit their local gym to see them play. So what would be the fastest way to build a team? I would ask for height, weight, highest level you played. This isn‚Äôt the most optimal, but it would make sense right?¬†

I‚Äôm not saying if you didn‚Äôt play college, you are, or can be better than a college player, but if you have to bet based on what you know, it would be safer to bet on the college player right? 

It's the same principle. What matter is the asking price for obvious reason. And gross revenue. Which is pretty much ‚Äúhow much does the shop make‚Äù

**The numbers do not lie.** 

You can get into small details about how many employees, the operating hours, location, etc.. but the 1st number needs to make sense. If you are unwilling to pay more than $200,000.00 for a shop, you need to walk away. If you start fidgeting the number to change the reality of the situation, the risk gets too much. Its like when people say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve failed every test so far, but if I can get 96 on the finals, I can still pass.‚Äù WRONG. You need to drop that course right now.¬† 

Keep that in mind. Its not about potentials only you can see. You are a rookie, you are not going to fulfill the potential. And chances are ..saving up to $200k means your whole life savings. You have one shot.¬†

**The liquid sales are 30%**

Any business that deals with ‚Äúliquids‚Äù is 30% profit.¬†

So for example, Gross Revenue listed as $250,000.00. Divide that by 12 months. It's about $20,833.33. 

So what's 30% of that? Its $6,250.00

So this shop is making $6,250.00 per month. Now when people talk about ‚Äúmargins‚Äù, what's the ‚Äúprofit‚Äù ? What is ‚ÄúEBDITA‚Äù are all secondary. A minor detail. Like asking a college player, how many points did you score, which college did you play. It matters, but given that they played up to college, they have stamp of approval and passed certain ‚Äútests.‚Äù of a successful player (cafe). So if $6,260 sounds solid, then its to move on to the next part.¬†

In the same sense, you don‚Äôt need to ask what the profits are. This can be manipulated by working longer hours, cutting employees, etc‚Ä¶You just ask how much sales you do per month, and roughly you can get a good idea how well the shop is.¬†If net profit is $6,250.00 Well is taht including owner's salary? what is the owner's salary? Minimum wage? or living wage? etc...so profit can be manipulated, but gross revenue can't.Thats why franchise take 5% of gross revenue, not net profit. 

**The Super numbers.**¬†

Previously, I mentioned you need to make your original investment back in 3 years. So let's calculate that. This shop makes $6,250.00 per month.¬†

$6,250.00 x 36 months = $225,000.00

**Now the details**

Now this shop was listed for $280,000 instead of $225,000.00 Why would they list it higher than the value of what is appropriate? Now then the third detail kicks in besides asking price and purchase price. They would ask for more b/c‚Ä¶.the $6,250.00 is better at face value.

If they ask for more than the textbook price, it's b/c making that $6,250 is easier than the normal method. So on the website, newspaper, broker¬† it will say something like....

‚Äì closed on sunday

\- fully remote, manager operated

\- prime location

Usually something that will say ‚Äúyou are paying more b/c it has X‚Äù . Now if it was selling for a lot less like $225,000. Then it means $6,250.00 is harder to make.¬†It will say something like this...

\- profit possible if managed by husband/wife duo

\- lease is finished less than 2 years

\- no employees on weekends.¬†

You are paying less b/c you are working more.¬†



**If the number make sense**

Now if you are satisfied with the purchasing price and the gross revenue, now its time to do your due diligence. That $6,250. How is it broken down? How many people work? Who‚Äôs working which hours? Do I need to work weekends? How old are the equipment? When is the lease up? Etc‚Ä¶and always remember, they are selling b/c they want out. You have more leverage.¬†

Minus the gross revenue‚Ä¶.I would say rent would be next in the line. Its the most reliable indicator of the value of the location. And Location is like height in basketball. By far, the most important (i‚Äôll write this more later).¬†

**The truth has no temperature**

The beauty in starting something is knowing that you can always make something better, but you have to understand what you are working with in the first place. You can‚Äôt have 5‚Äô5 parents and expect to succeed playing basketball. You can have passion for the sports, make money becoming trick shot player, youtube ,commentator,¬† etc, but not as a basketball player per say in the traditional sense.¬†

It's irrelevant whether you like coffee, or whether you are good at making coffee. Running a cafe business is not the same as loving coffee. A concept that eludes many many good people who love coffee that want to start the business.¬†

**Where I went wrong**

1st, I didn‚Äôt ask the CPA about the cafe. That was the 1st problem. I bought it based on a trusted friend and his source.¬†

2nd was getting the ‚Äúreport‚Äù card (Profit and Loss sheet) from the owner, not the CPA. The owner can make something up but CPA has no obligation to lie for the client. Since it will be CPA‚Äôs ass on the line if caught up in a legal trouble.¬†

3rd. I was in way too hurried to buy so I started fidgeting with the number (bro\~ I don‚Äôt have to pay franchise fee/royalty, this is a killer deal!). This shop was $50,000 at best. I paid double. And the profit is based on owner operated/managed. So it's even worse. I was making $2000-$3000 per month working 40 hours. Technically 80 since my wife worked as well.¬†

4th. I got into a field I have no idea about. Which is fine since I accepted that the worst case scenario is 2-3 years of experience, but I think I overestimated what the cost that wasn‚Äôt associated with the shop was. Stress from work, working weekends/nights costing me and my wife‚Äôs date nights, managing negative cash flow shops.¬†

Naivete knows no bounds.¬†

**No shame in not knowing something. Be willing to learn**¬†

I didn‚Äôt know this before purchasing b/c I was a moron.I learned this through my CPA after the fact. An owner has to juggle a lot of things and my IQ is 10 points. I have to learn about coffee, people management, marketing, sales, etc‚Ä¶¬†

CPA number IQ 100000 pts since this is all they do.¬† A good CPA will walk you through the number and see if it's worth it or not. A shitty CPA will just do the numbers, taxes, etc and leave you to be. Because CPA might know this is a bad shop, but he won't‚Äô get paid if you don't‚Äô buy the shop. So he‚Äôll just do his usual filing for tax, getting you a corporation set up, making you a P/L report.¬†

A great CPA will break it down for you. The cost is too expensive. Try to negotiate the rent lower next time. This utility company is better, his other client buys from this boba wholesale, etc‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt know and just picked a decent CPA on my own and once we found out this shop hit the shit, I switched to my parents CPA who‚Äôs been with us forever. He came to my wedding, bought me real expensive gifts that most CPAs wouldn‚Äôt phantom buy for their client‚Äôs son. Because his life was changed b/c of my parents he takes care of us in every way.

He was furious when he found out . He would never let me buy it if he was in the loop in the beginning. His actual words were ‚ÄúJOJO WHAT THE FUCK WERE U THINKING?‚Äù

And once again I learned the advice my parents told me the most about business. .¬† ‚ÄúBusiness is about people, not about money.‚Äù Having the right connection, right people are more important in the long run.

**How do you know‚Ä¶ that you know?**

How do you know you overpaid? How do you know your CPA Is good? How do you know if the coffee pricing is right?

As I mentioned previously, you don‚Äôt guys. You learn through trial and error. Best way would be to get as close to the actual ownership as possible and the repercussion of mistakes will be left to the owner and not you. And you can take all these lessons that I made, and I can hope you‚Äôll make less.¬†

I‚Äôm set for life in a financial sense‚Ä¶.. and in all transparency, if I close the shop and just loses $4000 per month on rent and etc for the rest of the lease‚Ä¶ it wouldn‚Äôt even tickle my bank account. 

But‚Ä¶.

I work hard, I can always look at the mirror and say ‚ÄúI've given all my best despite it all.‚Äù Although it doesn‚Äôt hurt in a financial sense, it does hurt me personally. I feel like a fraud. Using mommy‚Äôs money to start a cafe, a rich kid who couldn‚Äôt cut it through, causing stress to my wife b/c my foolish dream, someone who is a imposter and business person in only in name, but that's something I been trying to overcome and hopefully help some of you guys understand.....

that is... it's terrifyingly hard to run a business. I have 5 employees and thats already stressful, i don't‚Äô know how my parents are managing 100+ people.  it will be a wild ride of emotional rollercoaster of stress, sadness, happiness, doubts, anger, fear, etc...

I hope through my stories and mistakes, you guys can learn by proxy and help you on your journey to become a business person.¬†



See you guys next month!

# The Espresso Bean Aligner‚Ñ¢

*Tired of your coffee grounds being randomly oriented before tamping?* The Espresso Bean Aligner‚Ñ¢ uses **patent-pending** micro-magnetic vibrations to **align all coffee grounds in a uniform direction** before extraction, ensuring an **astrologically** optimal flow rate.

# Features:

‚úÖ **Ground-level Alignment** ‚Äì Each coffee particle is meticulously rotated to face the *ideal* extraction vector.

‚úÖ **Single-Origin Calibration** ‚Äì Different beans? No problem. Our AI-powered app (subscription required) determines the *correct* alignment pattern based on bean density, moisture, and moon phase.

‚úÖ **Titanium-Plated Quantum Needles** ‚Äì Uses a proprietary **non-contact** method to nudge misaligned grounds into perfect harmony, reducing **chaotic extractions** by up to 0.0002%.

‚úÖ **Works Best with WDT** ‚Äì Because your $300 WDT tool isn't overkill enough.

üí∞ **Price: $599 (Kickstarter Edition, $1,299 retail)** ‚Äì but real espresso lovers *know* the cost of *imperfection* is much higher because they also get a free sticker.

Pair this with a $2,000 hand-built, carbon-fiber magnetic distribution tool for **next-level clarity**. Because we all know **the real taste of espresso is in the placebo effect.**",2,1738336334.0,espressocirclejerk,2,0.75,False

1iegqk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MasterClass/comments/1iegqk4/review_of_joanna_gaines_masterclass/,Review of Joanna Gaines MasterClass,"I was given a 1 year master class subscription as a Christmas gift this year. I didn‚Äôt really know much about master class before this, but now that I have it, my goal is to use it well and get good value of it. My goal is to complete 50  classes before the subscription ends, or about a class a week. I love learning, and most classes seem fairly short, so this doesn‚Äôt seem unreasonable. To help keep me motivated, I am going to try to write a summary review of each class as I complete them. This is my first one. 

I began with Joanna Gaines - Designing a Home That Tells Your Story. It is a newer class so I expected it to be fairly current and I was not disappointed. This was Joanna talking design with her current style, a little more current than the Modern Farmhouse craze that she started a decade ago. The production quality was excellent. She is filmed mainly in her family home, and the lighting, sound quality, and filmography are all excellent. 

While I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Joanna‚Äôs designs, I did enjoy her class and I learned some good techniques from it.  Her first recommendation was to choose 3 words or phrases that describe how you  want your space to feel - warm and inviting, bright and electric, inviting, historical, etc. From there,  she asks you to imagine the space on its best day. For her living room, she pictures Christmas Day with her family, wrapping paper everywhere, playing new games at a big coffee table, the tree shining in the background. Her recommendation is to use the 3 words you identified and design with the space‚Äôs best day in mind.  Another key point she recommends is to find the ‚Äúhero‚Äù, or the special piece or focal point for the space. The ‚Äúhero‚Äù could be a piece of art, a fireplace, a furniture item, or even a view. 

While the class primarily films Joanna in her family home, there are many scenes of other homes that she has worked through in her design.  She describes the challenges of each home, how she decided to approach it, and there are many shots of befores and afters of these other homes that help illustrate her points. 

She also spoke a bit about how she is not formally trained in design, and how that has influenced her to focus on making each home reflect the lives of the people who live there, rather than follow strict design rules.  With her enormous success it was interesting to hear her speak about her lack of formal qualifications.

Overall, as my first masterclass, I found this one enjoyable and with tips that I may use in real life as I update the design of my own home. It was not super in-depth and did not have any additional materials, but at 85 minutes I did not expect great depth. This class would be good for anyone interested in putting together an intentional design of their space, and of course, for anyone who is a fan of Chip and Joanna in general.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Transforming your kitchen into a cozy home decor space is all about creating warmth, comfort, and inviting aesthetics. This area is often the heart of the home, where families gather to cook, eat, and share moments. A welcoming kitchen can elevate your daily routine and bring joy to your culinary experiences. Here are some effective tips to achieve that cozy kitchen vibe you desire.

### Choose Warm Colors

Color plays a significant role in how a space feels. For a cozy kitchen, consider using warm, muted tones. Think soft creams, buttery yellows, and gentle earth tones. These colors can create an inviting atmosphere that feels welcoming right from the moment you step in.

### Incorporate Natural Materials

Using natural materials in your kitchen decor can evoke a sense of tranquility. Here are some natural elements to consider:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cozy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Wood:** Wooden cabinets, shelves, and countertops add warmth to the space. Opt for reclaimed wood for a rustic charm.
- **Stone:** A stone backsplash or countertop introduces earthy textures and can make the kitchen feel grounded.
- **Textiles:** Consider natural fabrics like cotton, linen, or wool for curtains, tablecloths, and cushions.

### Layer Your Lighting

Lighting is key to creating a cozy atmosphere. Instead of relying solely on one overhead light, think about layering your lighting sources. Here are some ideas:

- **Pendant Lights:** Hang pendant lights over the kitchen island or dining area to create a focal point.
- **Under-Cabinet Lighting:** Use warm-toned LEDs under your cabinets to provide soft, ambient lighting.
- **Candlelight:** Incorporate candles on countertops or dining tables to introduce a warm, flickering glow.

### Add Personal Touches

Your kitchen should reflect your personality and style. Here are some ways to add a personal touch:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cozy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Artwork:** Hang up meaningful art pieces or photos that evoke fond memories.
- **Decorative Items:** Use decorative bowls, vintage cookbooks, or herb pots as accents.
- **Family Heirlooms:** Display cherished kitchen gadgets or dishes that have been passed down through the generations.

### Embrace Open Shelving

Open shelving can create a sense of space and accessibility in your kitchen. Display your favorite dishes, jars, and cookbooks, allowing for a personalized touch. This approach encourages you to keep your items organized while inviting guests to admire your curated collection.

### Create Cozy Nooks

Designate a small corner in your kitchen for relaxation or conversation. A small bistro table or an inviting bench can turn your kitchen into a cozy nook for morning coffees or evening chats. Add cushions or a soft throw blanket to enhance comfort.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cozy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Incorporate Plants

Add life to your kitchen with houseplants or fresh herbs. Plants can purify the air and bring a refreshing touch of nature indoors. Herbs like basil or thyme not only look lovely but can also be handy for cooking!

### Utilize Textures

Combining various textures can elevate the coziness of your kitchen. Here are suggestions for mixing textures:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cozy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Soft Fabrics:** Use plush or knitted dish towels and aprons that feel inviting.
- **Woven Baskets:** Integrate baskets to store produce or small kitchen items while adding texture.
- **Rustic Elements:** Consider incorporating elements like a woven table runner or a burlap tablecloth.

Your kitchen is a central gathering spot in your home, and it deserves to feel warm and inviting. Implementing these strategies can help you create a cozy home decor kitchen where you and your loved ones can create delightful memories. Whether it‚Äôs a quick breakfast or a family dinner, a warm kitchen atmosphere enhances every moment spent within its walls.

The Role of Color Schemes in Enhancing Kitchen Comfort and Style
----------------------------------------------------------------

Color is one of the most powerful tools in home decor, and in the kitchen, it plays a crucial role in creating a space that feels both comfortable and stylish. When you walk into a kitchen, the first thing that captures your attention is often the color scheme. The right colors can make your kitchen feel warm, inviting, and even larger than it is. Let's explore how different color schemes can enhance kitchen comfort and style.

When designing your kitchen, consider the following key aspects of color schemes:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cozy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Emotion:** Different colors evoke different feelings. For example, warm colors like red and orange can stimulate appetite and create an energetic atmosphere, while cool colors like blue and green can evoke calmness and tranquility.
- **Light:** The amount of natural light your kitchen receives can affect how colors look throughout the day. Lighter shades can help brighten up a kitchen that lacks light, making it feel more spacious and open.
- **Design Style:** Your overall design style should guide your color choices. Traditional kitchens often benefit from muted, classic colors, while modern kitchens may thrive on bold, vibrant colors.

Let‚Äôs look at some popular color schemes that can transform your kitchen into a cozy haven:

### Warm Neutral Tones

Warm neutral tones are perfect for creating a cozy kitchen environment. Shades of beige, cream, and soft taupe evoke feelings of warmth and comfort. These colors also give you the flexibility to incorporate various decor elements without clashing. Accenting with warmer shades can add depth and character to the space.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cozy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Soft Pastels

Soft pastel colors like mint green, baby pink, and light lavender can make your kitchen feel inviting and quaint. These colors are not only calming but also bring a touch of whimsy. Pair pastel-colored walls with white cabinets for a fresh and airy feel. You can also add pastel accessories like dishware or small appliances to create cohesion.

### Bold and Vibrant Hues

If you prefer a kitchen that exudes personality and energy, consider bold colors like royal blue, spicy red, or deep yellow. These shades can turn your kitchen into a lively gathering place. To balance bold hues, use them as accent colors. Consider painting one wall or adding colorful backsplash tiles, and keep larger surfaces like cabinets and countertops neutral.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cozy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Earth Tones

Earth tones like browns, rust, and olive green enhances a warm, natural atmosphere. These colors reflect the beauty of the outdoors and create a grounded feeling. Pair earth tones with wooden accents for a cohesive natural look that is both stylish and comfortable.

### Monochromatic Schemes

Monochromatic color schemes use varying shades of a single color. This approach can create a beautifully cohesive look. For example, a palette of blues can range from soft sky blue to deep navy, adding depth without overwhelming the senses. This scheme is especially effective in smaller kitchens, as it can make the space feel larger.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cozy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
To further enhance the comfort of your kitchen, consider incorporating materials and textures that complement your color scheme:

- **Wood:** Natural wood elements like cabinets and counters provide warmth and can enhance the overall feel of your space.
- **Textiles:** Incorporate comfortable textiles through curtains, table linens, and cushions on stools or benches that match your color scheme.
- **Fabrics:** Use cozy cushions or seat pads in your color palette to add an inviting touch for friends or family gathering around the kitchen table.

The role of color schemes in enhancing kitchen comfort and style cannot be understated. The right choice can turn your kitchen into a cozy retreat that reflects your personal style while welcoming family and friends. So take time to select colors that bring warmth, personality, and a sense of comfort to your kitchen. Be bold, be creative, and most importantly, choose colors that resonate with you!

A cozy home decor kitchen is all about creating an inviting atmosphere where you feel comfortable and inspired. By following the tips for a warm and cozy space, you can transform your kitchen into the heart of your home. Start by incorporating soft textiles‚Äîlike warm-colored dish towels or a plush rug‚Äîto add layers of comfort. personal touches such as family photos or handmade items can make your kitchen feel uniquely yours.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\
https://rewards.cslplasma.com/referral/referral-unique-code/eyJkb25vcklEIjoiMTMwMTkyMTciLCJjb2RlIjoiQVlMR1k1NERBRyJ9\
\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iegkm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iegkm0/have_fallen_for_a_married_colleague_and_its_mutual/,Have Fallen for a Married Colleague and it's Mutual.,"Background.

My (42F) husband (45M) had an affair several years ago.  We tried to work it out, but it hasn't worked, and we are now in the process of separating.  I have a colleague at work (48M) who is married (I'll call him John), and he and I became fast friends.  

He is not the reason I am divorcing.  But the realisation that there are people who can meet my needs and be more compatible with me is one of the reasons I started the separation process.  

The last few weeks have been intensely terrifying and strange and hard.  John confessed he has feelings.  I confessed I have feelings.  Both of us have adamantly reiterated that an affair is off the table and he needs to work on his marriage.  He has said we are basically soulmates, and I agree.  I've never felt about anybody the way I feel about him.  But I have been cheated on and it was the worst pain I've ever gone through.  Being the other woman is out of the question.  I just won't.  

I have expressed my concerns about him not giving enough attention to his primary relationship and that being too emotionally involved with me may harm his chances to revitalise his own relationship.  But we work together.  We see each other every day.  Neither of us are going to quit.  And frankly the man is like air to me right now. 

Look, I know the consequences of this.  Please don't state the obvious.  We maintain physical distance.  We do not hug or touch or sit close. His words when I was having a cry about the impending revelation of the separation to my children - ""I desperately want to hug you, but I cant.  I know you understand why"" - and I do.  It would be dangerous.  We do have coffee in the communal lunch room in the morning because we are always the first in the office.  And we occasionally walk around our work campus at lunch where approx 1k people are at any given day.  

I desperately want him.  I also know that I should not.  I know that for any relationship between us to be successful, he would have to be single, and both of us would need time alone.  I need time alone.  

I have been extremely explicit in my expectation he work on his marriage.  Literally ""I do not regret working hard to fix my marriage.  It means I can walk away from it feeling like I gave it my all.  You have to do that too.  I hope you can be more successful than I was.  I think you're great.  I think in another life we would have been perfect for each other.  And if you're ever single, my god please call me.  But you have to try.""

His response ""if I am ever getting a divorce, you'll be the second person I tell after my wife.  You're perfect.  We would be perfect.  But I have to stay, at least for my kids.""

We both want to be friends.  I value his friendship and kindness and insight.  He is the person I feel safest with.  How can I do this?  What steps can we take to maintain a friendship built on mutual respect and admiration, and also safeguard it against these feelings of want?  Do I just hold it all in and stay casual and hope it mellows?  Is it bad to hope that he calls his marriage DOA and we can be together?  Do I stay the friend in the background and hope I find something else?

This has been the strangest experience and not one I ever thought I'd have and certainly not one I sought out, and I'm angry with myself for being in this position.  Kindness in the comments is deeply appreciated.",0,1738335360.0,Advice,6,0.5,False

1iegjnh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iegjnh,Week 5: Something Old - Shoofly Pie (Meta: Pies & Tarts),"There are a lot of 100+ year old pie recipes to choose from, and I went with this Pennsylvania Dutch pie that was popular in the late 1800s. 

I got the recipe from Rose Levy Beranbaum, who got it from food historian Will Weaver, who got it from his grandmother, who got it from the label on a bottle of molasses. This is a really unique pie! The base is formed by a mixture of hot coffee, molasses and baking soda, which is topped with a buttery spiced crumb. Where the layers meet, a cakey texture is formed while it bakes, which gives it this triple layer effect. My kids were less than thrilled, not being used to such a strong molasses flavor. I actually enjoyed it, and froze the remaining pieces for myself to enjoy for breakfast with strong coffee. It‚Äôs more of a breakfast pie to me than a dessert pie. This is a polarizing flavor profile for sure.

For the crust, I pulled out my copy of Fannie Farmer‚Äôs *The Boston Cooking School Cookbook* printed in 1914. She has a number of ‚Äúpie paste‚Äù recipes in there, and I went with ‚Äúchopped paste‚Äù as it seemed closest to what we consider pie crust to be these days. It‚Äôs pretty light on instruction, so I had to use what I already know about pie crust, but honestly this crust was excellent. It was strong enough to pick up a piece of pie with my hand, tender enough to cut easily with a fork, nice buttery flavor with delicately crispy flakes from the lard.

First off, the food. Previously the Conway was a gastronomical pub and had some truly delectable dishes. I‚Äôm happy to report that the new Conway follows a similar ideology but by elevating pub food without getting too fancy. My wife had the macaroni cheese with garlic bread and I had welsh fags with red wine gravy, creamy mash, and garden peas. We both thoroughly enjoyed the meal. I saw the fish and chips carried past and can‚Äôt wait to go give it a try.

As to the drinks, they have a good selection for a nice, corner pub. They‚Äôre is a rotating set of four cask ales, your standard assortment of pub-favorite draughts, wine, spirits, coffee, and tea. Personally, I was happy they were serving two cask bitters.

 The staff were friendly, amicable, and attentive. Granted, it‚Äôs the first day and I assume they want to build a legion of locals for repeat business but I think it bodes well for the overall tone and feel. 

I like how they did relatively little to change it over from when Knife and Fork were running it, mostly just some added paint, a few different decorations, and some better furniture for the pub. I think it will actually have a better atmosphere as just a good local.

Anyway, I recommend that if you‚Äôre in Pontcanna and want a drink or bite to eat you should stop by and give them a try.",10,1738335160.0,Cardiff,6,0.75,False

We are both looking for a similar kink dynamic and met through fetlife, but live about 2 hours away from each other. We met up in person for the first time about a month ago for a coffee date just to get to know each other and see if we click. We got along well and in this meeting she told me she was very experienced in poly, used to teach classes in the local kink community, has been practicing it for 20+ years. She is married and has a live in male partner. I am also married and have been poly for many years. We have our second meetup planned for this weekend and she called me suddenly this week and told me her live in male partner is having some anxiety about our date, and maybe the potential that she and I will do sexual things together(she didn‚Äôt say this, but because she and I talked about coming back to my house and potentially engaging in sexual activity, I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs partially why he is anxious) and was insisting on coming along with her, especially because we are going to my house and my husband will be there. My husband won‚Äôt interact with us or be involved in anything we do, and I communicated that to her. I communicated to her that I would rather have this time be one on one for us to still build our own connection, since it will be only the second time we are seeing each other in person, but in the future I‚Äôm totally happy to schedule a time  to meet her partner and for her all four of us, my husband included, to meet. 
I was on the phone with her while she was driving, and when I communicated that I wanted us to go on the date alone (which she was also saying she wanted and that he didn‚Äôt need to come on this date), she had just got home and he came up to the car and started inserting himself into our phone conversation. He told me ‚Äúi understand‚Äù and I was a little off put, not expecting to have to talk to him, and then later in the background I heard him saying he would still come in his own car and do his own thing. This all seems like a red flag to me. I‚Äôm not sure why she needed to involve me in this conversation at all. I guess she needed to clarify if my husband was going to be involved in our meeting at my house or if we did anything. But otherwise it seemed a little to me like she had a hard time communicating a boundary with him and like he was kind of pushy, which is very off putting to me. Is this typical behavior for a meta? My usual experience has been primarily with group/couple dynamics and this is one of my first solo poly dating experiences in awhile. ",28,1738335017.0,polyamory,23,0.94,False

I also asked them to provide some information about more long term opportunities to volunteer for anyone who is interested. 

The NAWS donation wishlist can be found at the provided link and also through their website. If you buy an item off the list and want to come with us to donate in person, please remember to have the items shipped to your address. 

The MAIN two things that are always needed are clumping cat litter and paper towels.

NAWS wanted to stress that even if you aren't financially able to go out and purchase new things for the animals, you most likely have a few items at home that are needed, like old pillows, towels, sheets (fitted or not), blankets, pillow cases, etc!¬†

There is no pressure to participate in the collection of items for NAWS. If you‚Äôre strapped for cash or don‚Äôt want to participate in the collection drive, that is totally fine! Please know you‚Äôre still very welcome to come say hello and visit NAWS with us.

Today is Friday. I need to sketch out my painting. I want to finish Petri‚Äôs arms and legs. Perhaps even his ears which were really challenging. 

I can‚Äôt stop thinking that I need to talk to my boss about something weird that is happening with the jobs that I am selling. I‚Äôve been working on some hardcore projects. Really time intensive and super detailed. By the time it comes around to detail fire protection costs, I either don‚Äôt want to deal with a detailed fire protection estimation or I don‚Äôt have time. So I keep a prefab itemized list of fire protection on my desktop‚Ä¶ I copy and paste to the quote. Boom. All scopes are covered. I sent it to my contractors. 
But all I am selling right now is fire protection. Like‚Ä¶ ungodly amounts of fire protection. Thousands of dollars worth of fire protection. 
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs trending because of the LA fires. I don‚Äôt know if old fire protection needs to be updated because it‚Äôs the first of the year‚Ä¶.. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm selling fire protection only because my margins are too high‚Ä¶. Should I take it down to 20%??? Or what if the itemized pricing is influencing them? I dunno. I‚Äôm baffled. My colleagues have consistent, regular sales but mine are all over the place lately. I just feel like I need some professional guidance. 
I‚Äôm going to ask him if he can spare 10 mins when I go in Tuesday. 

I‚Äôm excited for my Tour Du Portland tonight. 

I am worried my partner is going to ask me to marry him on the 8th. 
But then I think ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù. 
It‚Äôs not as if being hopelessly in love with someone ever did me any good. Do you see them around now? 
I think about how gross dating was this last time around (2 maybe 3 summers ago?) and I think ‚Äúnah‚Äù. When I look at the news, and when I was on social media everyone was talking about how dating is a cesspool. I‚Äôve considered the benefits of living alone and just having occasional flings when I get horny but that always feels so terrible after a while. And the sex is never any good. 
I think, I am with someone who really loves me and cares about my well being. When I consider how dangerous it is to be a woman in today‚Äôs world I think‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs not so bad where I am. Yeah‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs sexless. Yeah, we are not romantic. Yeah, this isn‚Äôt really what I thought it was going to be. But I‚Äôm safe and so is he. We look out for each other. We are family. 
But then I start to grieve the way it feels to be desired sexually. I think about how much I miss feeling sexy. I don‚Äôt have those feelings for my partner anymore because I feel like his caregiver. Which is not sexy. We have an emotionally stable relationship but the health stuff has been such a rollercoaster that my nerves frazzled out. 
But then I think about how just about every single man I have been with has a raging porn addiction. When I got with my partner I said ‚Äúlook, I understand the draw to porn and I don‚Äôt care if you watch it‚Ä¶. But I don‚Äôt want to know that you watch it. Please hide any magazine or videos you may have, please pick one device to watch porn on so I don‚Äôt have to find it in browser histories‚Ä¶.please just be respectful when you see a hot woman walking near you‚Ä¶‚Äù and he has kept to every single one of those things. He gets pervy when sex is on tv. But I forgive him. It can‚Äôt be avoided and at this point, neither one of us are having any sex so‚Ä¶ why not. Though it still makes me uncomfortable to watch a sex scene on tv with him nearby. I can practically hear his panting. Frankly, I‚Äôd probably be panting too if I weren‚Äôt so fixated on the discomfort of the panting elephant in the room. 

I dunno. Do I want to be single again? Do I want to deal with all of these porn addicted, cheating ass, naked coffee getting, buttwipes? I don‚Äôt know how much I have left in me. Maybe being married to someone like my partner wouldn‚Äôt be such a bad thing. He doesn‚Äôt force me to have sex with him. He doesn‚Äôt hit me. He doesn‚Äôt call me names. He doesn‚Äôt go out of his way to cause me emotional suffering. In fact, it hurts him to even think that he has caused me emotional suffering. 

What should I do?

Flow state, mindfulness, and consciousness control are tools for becoming one with our universe

**The path to enlightenment resides in every aspect of our life**. Contrary to what is most believed by the masses, one can walk the path to enlightenment by any activity of her choosing. And in most cases,¬†**reaching a state of total awareness, or mindfulness is never a mystery that is far from the reach of those who do not 'devote' themselves into a school of religious or spiritual practice.**

I am a musician. I can say that¬†**most of the musicians who reach a professional level of mastery at their selected instrument have reached a high level of mindfulness by simply honing their craft without trying to get into mindfulness**.

I started playing guitar at 17 in high school and decided that I wanted to become a professional player at 21 when I was in college studying chemical engineering. Starting at such an old age, I decided that I must practice guitar 6 hours a day to play catch-up, which basically took every second of my waking hours outside of studying, eating, showering, and laundry. The 6-hour daily routine was painful at first. The first couple of hours were fine; I was able to focus and perform the exercises, but then my mind devolved into this state of wandering where random thoughts that don't really matter just pop out of nowhere, such as 'What do others think of me suddenly wanting to pursue music as a career? Will they laugh at me?', 'What if I fail? Will I become a laughingstock for others?', or more trivial matters such as 'What should I eat for lunch today?' or 'Did I say something inappropriate the other day during class?' Needless to say, the remaining hours of the practice became an ordeal for me. As painful as it was, I managed to maintain the 6-hour practice routine for a few more weeks out of passion for music. After those very tormenting weeks, something amazing happened to me.

At first, I found it much easier for me to get into this state of focus,¬†**what I noticed first is that I can learn the stuff much faster now**. What normally took me a few days to learn, give it a scale, a chord, or a lick, I could get them done in a day or two's worth of practices. Certainly, this might be contributed to my level of dexterity getting better, but it almost felt real for me that,¬†**I became smarter by being more focused.**¬†No only that I became more focused, I was also able to sustain it longer. What was 30 minutes of intense focus got extended into 1 hours, 3 hours, and eventually the entire practice session. It was not for another months before I managed to sustain it through the entire session of course, but¬†**once this thing started rolling, it became easier and easier for me.**¬†Not only I was able to sustain the 6-hour practice daily routine, that routine was furthered into 10 hour practice daily routine after I graduated from college and devoted full time into the music career.

The amazing experience did not stop at getting better at guitar playing itself, I found myself to be able to concentrate my mind into a single point, in this case, the sound.¬†**And when I was in that mode, things slows down in front of me, I can sense the tiniest details of the sound**, not just the sound from my own guitar playing, but the surrounding sound in the environment as well.¬†**I also felt a warm flow of energy connecting my brain, my fingers, and my ears, cycling non-stop**. It was very soothing experience, to me, 6 hours of practice was no longer a chore, it became a getaway for me, if not paradise.

Not until a couple years later after reading quite some philosophy books including eastern schools such as Taoism itself and Zen Buddhism, and western schools such as Arthur Schopenhauer did I understand what was happening to me. Simply put, it was¬†**the first stage of achievement towards enlightenment called flow state, or 'in the zone'.**

# What is flow state?

**When a mind is concentrated at a high level, it forgets its own existence and becomes one with the object**. ¬†This is often referred to as flow state, or 'in the zone', a term used to describe a state of deep focus and effortless performance where everything seems to click. It's like¬†**you're so immersed in what you're doing that you lose track of time, self-consciousness fades away, and every action flows naturally without much effort**. In this state, every action feels effortless, and everything seems to align perfectly. It‚Äôs a magical blend of intense focus, intrinsic motivation, and a sense of control over the task at hand.

# Characteristics of the Flow State

1. **Complete Concentration**¬†In flow, your mind is wholly focused on the activity. Everything outside the task fades into the background, your thoughts, worries, and even the passage of time. For example, an artist painting might not realize they‚Äôve been working for hours because they‚Äôre so absorbed in their work.
2. **Merging of Action and Awareness**¬†You feel like there‚Äôs no separation between you and what you‚Äôre doing. A musician might become one with their instrument, or a runner might feel their body and the path beneath them moving in perfect harmony.
3. **Loss of Self-Consciousness**¬†In flow, there‚Äôs no room for self-doubt or overthinking. You‚Äôre not worried about how you look or what others might think. You‚Äôre simply being¬†in the moment.
4. **Distorted Sense of Time**¬†Time either slows down at a moment or speeds up over a duration. Things around you might feel like they are in slow motion, and you might spend hours on a task but feel like only minutes have passed.
5. **Effortlessness and Ease**¬†While the task itself might be demanding, it feels effortless in flow. Every movement and decision seems to arise naturally, without forcing anything.
6. **Intrinsic Reward**¬†The activity itself becomes its own reward. You‚Äôre not driven by external validation or outcomes; instead, the joy of doing the task fuels your motivation.

# 

Simply put,¬†**flow state happens when you're deeply focused on a challenging task, usually one that requires skill**. It's rewarding on its own because not only it helps you master that activity but also shields you from negative feelings like self-doubt, anxiety, and overthinking. It‚Äôs a way to both improve and find peace at the same time.

Interestingly, the concept of flow aligns closely with Taoist philosophy, particularly the practice of Wu Wei (Êó†‰∏∫), or ""effortless action."" Both emphasize aligning with the natural flow of life and achieving harmony by letting go of resistance and overthinking. Just as Taoism encourages living in harmony with the Tao, flow involves syncing your mind and body with the task, allowing everything to unfold naturally. So in Taoism, flow state is part of the Wu Wei practice where enlightenment is set as the ultimate goal.

Flow state is an incredible experience, but it has its limits, that it can only be triggered while performing a skill-intensive task. But what if someone could enter this state of deep focus and presence at will, like flipping a switch, without needing to engage in those activities? This is where the journey transitions to¬†**the second stage of achievement towards enlightenment: mindfulness.**

# What is mindfulness?

Mindfulness is¬†**the ability to enter a flow state-like mode without needing to engage in a skill-demanding task**. Unlike flow state, which requires intense focus on an activity to reach that state of deep immersion, mindfulness allows you to tap into a similar sense of presence and peace at any time, no matter what you‚Äôre doing.

In mindfulness, you don‚Äôt rely on external tasks to quiet your mind or fully engage your awareness. Instead,¬†**much like the intense focus of the flow state, you simply observe the present moment with full attention**; whether it‚Äôs the rhythm of your breath, the sensations in your body, or the sounds around you. It‚Äôs as if you‚Äôre tapping into the clarity and calm of the flow state, but without needing a specific trigger, your mind itself becomes the focus.

This makes mindfulness incredibly versatile and powerful.¬†**It can be practiced during everyday activities, like walking, eating, or even waiting in line**. Over time, it becomes a tool to find balance and focus even in the most chaotic or mundane situations, offering a sustainable way to stay centered without the need for external conditions to be perfect.

It was only after years of intensive guitar practice and heavy reading that I one day realized I could do this. The euphoria I felt was incredible, it feels like unlocking a hidden superpower.¬†**From that moment on, I have never experienced a single night of difficulty falling asleep, no matter how bad the situation is, be it career struggles, financial issues, or personal hardships**.

Whenever I lie down, I naturally enter this state of mindfulness, and all my thoughts simply drift away. It feels like I become a feather floating in mid-air, gently swaying with the motion of a soft breeze, moving left and right in a soothing, lullaby-like rhythm. This calming sensation has allowed me to fall asleep within five minutes every single time. Unless I have had one too many cups of coffee, of course.

**Another incredible benefit of being able to enter mindfulness is that I never feel bored anymore**, even when working on mundane tasks like data entry during the early days of starting my first business. By simply shifting my focus to the present moment, the sound of the keyboard clicking, the rhythm of my fingers typing, or even the small details on the screen, I find myself fully engaged, almost as if the boring task itself transforms into something fun. Mindfulness turns even the most tedious chores into opportunities for calm and presence, making boredom a thing of the past.

The third benefit of this 'superpower' is the ability to channel negative thoughts into positive ones.¬†**When negativity creeps in, whether it's anger, self-doubt, anxiety, frustration or depression, mindfulness provides a way to pause and redirect those thoughts**. Instead of fighting them, I observe them without judgment by entering mindfulness, almost like watching clouds pass in the sky. This simple act creates space between me and the negativity, allowing me to 'quarantine' it. By doing so,¬†**a setback becomes a lesson, a failure turns into growth, and uncertainty becomes a chance for curiosity**.

But of course, the ability to channel these negative thoughts is its own craft, requiring years of practice and patience to master.¬†**Much like using an instrument to create beautiful music, mindfulness is merely a tool to orchestrate this great symphony of peace of mind**. It takes time to learn how to harmonize conflicting thoughts and emotions, to turn noise into melody. Mindfulness provides the foundation, but it‚Äôs through intentional practice and reflection that one can truly conduct this inner symphony, transforming life's chaos into a steady rhythm of balance and clarity.

The final benefit of this state of mindfulness is that your senses become much sharper. Colors appear more vivid, sounds feel richer, and even the texture of simple things, like the fabric of your clothes or the coolness of a breeze, becomes more noticeable. Simply put, it‚Äôs a higher level of awareness.¬†**When you reach this state, you realize how limited your senses used to be, almost like an animal confined to a very narrow range of perception**. The world now feels bigger, richer, and more vibrant, and you can fully immerse yourself in the present moment like never before. You start to experience the world with a heightened awareness, as if a fog has been lifted. This heightened perception allows you to fully engage with the present moment, appreciating life‚Äôs subtle details that often go unnoticed. It‚Äôs like switching from a blurry, dim lens to crystal-clear, high-definition vision, making even the simplest experiences feel meaningful.

**Meditation is the most common practice to learn mindfulness**¬†because it provides a structured way to train your mind to focus on the present moment. By setting aside time for meditation, you create a dedicated space to observe your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations without judgment. This practice develops the mental clarity and awareness that are at the heart of mindfulness. Meditation isn‚Äôt the only way to practice mindfulness, but it‚Äôs one of the most effective. Over time, the skills developed in meditation naturally expand into other areas of your life, allowing you to experience mindfulness in everything you do.

My path to mindfulness was accidental. I did not know what mindfulness meant until I had reached it by comparing the things I could do to what it enables. So, it might offer some insightful knowledge to those still on the journey to achieving it. One way to begin is by reaching the flow state through practicing a challenging skill first, to get a taste of how mindfulness feels, and then working from there to apply the same level of focus to every aspect of daily life, no matter how trivial. Another thing I did right was that I read a lot history and philosophy classics, with the¬†[*Tao Te Ching*](https://www.taooflife.org/post/tao-te-ching-translation)¬†being one of them. This, I believe, helped me significantly, although I understand that it‚Äôs not for everyone. In short, there is no fixed route to mindfulness.¬†**Everyone walks a different path, so don‚Äôt try to find the ‚Äúbest way‚Äù or a ‚Äúshortcut.‚Äù Instead, work with whatever resonates with you**.

Now the final stage before achieving enlightenment, it is something I vaguely sense but am not 100% sure of its existence, and I might not be able to get there even if it is real. Currently mostly based on my speculation, It is¬†**the full ability to control consciousness at will.**

# Our conscious and subconscious mind

Our mind is made of consciousness and subconsciousness. According to most psychological models, the conscious mind represents only a small portion of our overall awareness, while the subconscious mind encompasses a much larger domain. The subconscious holds memories, beliefs, and patterns that are not actively in focus yet significantly influence our behavior. In essence, the conscious mind is like the visible tip of an iceberg, while the subconscious forms the vast majority hidden below the surface.

Once we reach a level where we can enter mindfulness at will, it becomes possible to explore the next step: attempting to control our consciousness.¬†**While the subconscious mind may seem uncontrollable, it can still be influenced through conscious effort**. The subconscious can be understood as an accumulation of thoughts, ideas, beliefs, experiences, and memories formed over the years. By adjusting our perspective, which is an inherent function of consciousness, we can begin to ""make sense"" of this vast reservoir and indirectly shape its influence on our behavior and perceptions.

# So what does it mean to control the consciousness?

The first level of control over consciousness is the ability to pause and unpause it at will. In Taoism,¬†*Zuowang (ÂùêÂøò)*, or 'sitting and forgetting', is an essential spiritual practice that embodies this concept.¬†**Zuowang represents a level beyond the practice of mindfulness**, where the practitioner seeks to stop the consciousness entirely instead of entering a flow state, a state of channeling all consciousness into a singular point of focus.

So, what is it like to stop your consciousness? I've only been able to achieve this for less than a couple of years. From my experience, you can make your mind 'blank' at will.¬†**When the mind goes blank, you shift into the role of a pure observer, fully present to both the internal and external worlds**. Although not exactly the same, this state aligns with the 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's theory of the 'will-less' state, where one transcends desires and personal drives, entering a realm of pure perception and detached awareness.

There are obvious benefits to the ability to stop consciousness.

**The first benefit is that you gain almost full control over your temper, mood, and thoughts.**¬†When negativity creeps in, you don‚Äôt need to channel these feelings elsewhere by redirecting your focus to a task or a thought, whether that‚Äôs achieving a flow state or practicing mindfulness.¬†**You simply put a stop to consciousness itself, allowing those negative feelings to dissipate.**¬†Individuals who attain this level of mastery over their consciousness will notice their temper becomes moderated and they develop immunity to provocation.¬†**They will act spontaneously in any situation, no longer hindered by feelings of nervousness, intimidation, or awkwardness, which often stem from self-consciousness.**

Moreover,¬†**these individuals do not feel the need to rise above others, to triumph over them, or to express themselves for validation**. Such desires typically arise from a consciousness driven by bodily urges, leading to a state of perpetual uneasiness, anxiety, and frustration. By relinquishing these needs, they create a sense of inner calm that allows for deeper self-awareness and a more harmonious existence.

This ability fosters an environment in which external pressures and societal expectations lose their grip.¬†**Those who can stop consciousness often find themselves free from the burden of competing with others, enabling them to pursue their passions and interests for their own sake rather than for external approval**. This shift in perspective cultivates a kind of contentment that is neither dependent on success nor disturbed by failure.

As a result, they become more resilient in the face of life‚Äôs challenges. Without the constant fluctuations brought on by mood and desire, they can navigate adversities with a peace of mind. This newfound resilience allows them to engage with their surroundings fully, appreciating experiences as they come rather than filtering them through a lens of comparison or striving.

**Another good thing about being able to pause the consciousness is to fill the mind with pure happiness.**¬†By stopping the consciousness, the body and mind become one, and thus in perfect harmony with one another,¬†**once this state is established, there are waves of joy spurt out from within the chest**. This state is much like an infant, whose consciousness is still undeveloped due to the absence of accumulated building blocks such as memory and experience. Like an infant, one returns to a state of pure being, untainted by mental clutter, judgments, or external pressures, experiencing life in its most natural and unfiltered form.

It is the pure form of happiness that requires no reason, no longer one needs the stimulation of earthly achievements such as money, power, and fame to be content. Especially when the latter often bring more suffering than happiness. Speaking of which, let's reach a little further on the topic since we are already here. Does this mean we should not seek earthly success? The answer is that it doesn't matter, but we do need money for our overall well-being, so it is not a bad idea to seek money. As for the other two, it depends on the lifestyle you choose, if your path is politics, yes, then seek power; if you are an actor, your main practice is through acting, then yes, seek fame. What we seek is not important, the important thing is that we walk the path not sacrificing the true happiness.¬†[The way to pursue money, power, and fame without compromising this core value is what Wu Wei practice all about, you can read more about it in this other article.](https://www.taooflife.org/post/what-is-wu-wei-and-why-it-is-good-for-us)

# The next level of controlling the consciousness is reconstruct the consciousness at will.

**Since I have yet to achieve this level, much of what I share below is based on speculation**. Following the ability to pause consciousness, the next natural step would likely involve the capacity to reconstruct it at will.

# What does it mean to reconstruct consciousness?

**First of all, consciousness relies on the continuous stream of information provided by the senses to exist**. The normal process of its formation is as follows: sensory inputs from the external world are collected, processed, and integrated into a coherent experience. These inputs are then interpreted by the mind, giving rise to thoughts, emotions, and an awareness of the present moment, collectively known as consciousness.

Reconstructing consciousness, on the other hand, represents the opposite process.¬†**It is an advanced ability to control the mind so powerfully that it can actively influence and ""backfeed"" the senses, shaping the sensory experience according to the consciousness it chooses to reconstruct**. In this state, the practitioner reverses the flow of influence, using the mind to redefine perception, creating a subjective reality shaped by intentional thought rather than raw sensory data.

Does this sound too sci-fi? It‚Äôs not. In fact,¬†**there‚Äôs a very common and age-old method of reconstructing consciousness called art**. Art, in all its forms, is a deliberate act of shaping perception, allowing the artist to implant their consciousness into the mind of their audience, effectively reconstructing it. This is why, when we immerse ourselves in a masterpiece, be it a symphony, a novel, a painting, or even a film, we momentarily forget our own existence. We are transported to a different time and space, experiencing the world as the creator once did.

Any skilled artist possesses the ability to transform their consciousness into sensory media, whether through sound, visuals, or words. However, it is the 'quality'¬†of the consciousness they project that determines whether their work becomes popular, resonates deeply with others, or attains the status of a classic. Therefore, an artist passively waits for 'inspiration' to strike before transforming their consciousness into a medium of the senses, and their audience relies on this medium to passively reconstruct a very specific sample of consciousness. This is how we know that¬†**artistic ability is not the same concept as the reconstruction of consciousness we are discussing here, but merely a specific example of it**. It also explains why being a great artist alone is not enough to reconstruct consciousness at will.

# What is it like to be able to reconstruct consciousness?

**The ability to reconstruct consciousness is so profound that the possessor of this gift can perceive the world through the eyes of others, both literally and metaphorically**. They gain the capacity to see what others see, feel what others feel, and experience reality from perspectives entirely different from their own. Remarkably, this ""others"" is not confined to human beings. Instead,¬†**it transcends the human experience, extending its reach to all entities in existence**. From the smallest atom vibrating with its inherent energy to the vast, incomprehensible expanse of the universe, everything carries its own form of ""consciousness,"" a unique fingerprint shaped by its state, function, and existence within the cosmos.

**When one attains such an ability, their understanding of reality shifts from the limited confines of individuality to the limitless interconnectedness of all things**. They are no longer bound by their personal senses or self-centered awareness. Instead, they can tap into the universal flow of information, aligning themselves with the ""consciousness"" of any being, object, or system they desire. Just like Zhuangzi's dream of becoming a butterfly,¬†**the boundaries between self and other begin to blur**. In his dream, Zhuangzi did not know whether he was Zhuangzi dreaming of being a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming of being Zhuangzi. This profound parable speaks to a truth about the nature of consciousness, its fluid, shifting, and interconnected form.

This ability dissolves barriers, leaving the practitioner with an intimate understanding of the fabric of existence, as if they were simultaneously the observer and the observed, the creator and the creation.[¬†In](http://creation.in/)¬†this state, the boundaries between ""self"" and ""other"" evaporate. A rock, seemingly inanimate, reveals its ancient story through its molecular vibrations. A tree shares its silent dialogue with the wind and the whispers of the earth beneath its roots. A distant star, light-years away, projects its own consciousness through its pulsating energy, carrying tales of its birth, life, and eventual death.¬†**Even the universe itself, vast and eternal, breathes with a consciousness so immense it defies comprehension, yet one who reconstructs consciousness can feel its pulse, like a faint echo reverberating through eternity**.

The implications of such an ability are staggering.¬†**Imagine understanding the struggles of another person intimately, not just through empathy or observation, but by actually becoming¬†them in a sense, albeit temporarily**. Grasping their fears, their joy, their pain, not as an outsider but as if they were your own. It shifts the notion of communication from mere words to a profound unity of understanding, a complete dissolution of misunderstanding. Beyond the human plane, it allows one to sync with the rhythm of nature, to understand and harmonize with ecosystems, and perhaps even tap into the wisdom of the universe, Tao, itself.

Ultimately, to reconstruct consciousness is to engage in a sacred dance with existence. It is a journey that deepens one's relationship with the universe, revealing the truth that everything is connected, everything is alive in its own way, and everything has a story to tell, and through this ability, one can listen, understand, and even join that story, becoming a co-creator in the infinite tapestry of being.

# Beyond the ultimate control of consciousness

The flow state, mindfulness, and consciousness control are like Matryoshka dolls, where each subsequent layer contains the previous one. This means that the path to enlightenment is not linear. You reach the next level without leaving the previous one, which can be analogized to a pyramid structure, in which the previous level serves as the stepping stone, or foundation, for the next level.

**They serve as a toolkit for us to forge our path to enlightenment, the ultimate state of becoming one with Tao's manifestation in our universe ‚Äî nature**. Once we have gathered all three tools, flow state, mindfulness, and consciousness control, we can apply them in our daily lives to uncover the profound meaning of the Tao.

To do this,¬†**we begin by gathering building blocks: insights gleaned from reading, emotions stirred by appreciating art, music, and literature, reasoning developed through thinking, and feelings evoked by memories accessed during flow states**. Each of these components offers valuable perspectives and deepens our understanding of existence.

Using mindfulness,¬†**we then organize these building blocks, cultivating an awareness that allows us to see how these elements interconnect**. Mindfulness encourages us to be present with our experiences, providing clarity and enhancing our ability to reflect on what we've gathered.

Finally,¬†**we employ consciousness control to reconstruct our understanding of the universe's consciousness**. This transformative process enables us to weave together the insights and emotions we‚Äôve collected, allowing us to perceive the richness of life through the lens of the Tao. By aligning ourselves with this universal consciousness, we not only gain deeper insights into our own existence but also foster a sense of unity with all that is.

In this way, our toolkit becomes a mean of exploration and connection, guiding us toward a more profound comprehension of Tao, the nature and our place within its vast manifestation. Only then can we say that we are enlightened.",0,1738334786.0,enlightenment,0,0.5,False

We either go for a walk or hang out in my apartment. I prefer the latter as we both feel more comfortable there as he doesn't have to worry about being caught and for me, well, it's my home. The walks are the meetups that he plans. I enjoy spending time with him but I don't feel comfortable making out in public places and in remote locations I feel like I'm world's most guarded shameful secret. Well, I am a shameful secret to him but I don't like being reminded of it at all times. Also it's January and the weather is crap where we live so it's not comfortable at all. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy nature but I don't enjoy that it's the only way we meet outside from my place and I don't enjoy being felt up in freezing cold.

I just got back from one of those walks and it got me thinking. I asked him a while ago when he's going to take me on a ""proper date"" and he gave today's date. So I got excited but each time we spoke, the plans were getting less and less impressive. He asked me jokingly if I wanted dinner and flowers and I told him that flowers are not necessary. Then we were supposed to spend the day together to go for lunch and a little trip / sightseeing and he kept calling it ""our first date"". Then it came to meeting for coffee in a nice place. In the end, he bought me coffee at a petrol station and we drove to a remote location in our own cars and just stayed there. I do enjoy spending time with him but I felt disappointed. He worries so much about being seen with me that he doesn't take my comfort into account. We are long distance and we never meet around the city where he lives so it's not like there's a big chance of bumping into someone who knows him. 

I told him that he's planning lousy dates and he said that I should be the one doing the planning then. I told him that we meet only when he tells me he's available and he doesn't want to be seen with me I public. He replied that I can always ask when he's available and it's not that he doesn't want, it's that he can't be seen with me. I understand that but I feel like my options are still limited.

I could invite him out to dinner in some nice remote place or in a city far away but I don't want him to say no or show up and feel uncomfortable or stressed. Also, I don't feel like he appreciates me enough to take initiative and plan something nice.

In this article, we are going to explore the each stage before achieving the ultimate state of enlightenment.

Flow state, mindfulness, and consciousness control are tools for becoming one with our universe

**The path to enlightenment resides in every aspect of our life**. Contrary to what is most believed by the masses, one can walk the path to enlightenment by any activity of her choosing. And in most cases,¬†**reaching a state of total awareness, or mindfulness is never a mystery that is far from the reach of those who do not 'devote' themselves into a school of religious or spiritual practice.**

I am a musician. I can say that¬†**most of the musicians who reach a professional level of mastery at their selected instrument have reached a high level of mindfulness by simply honing their craft without trying to get into mindfulness**.

I started playing guitar at 17 in high school and decided that I wanted to become a professional player at 21 when I was in college studying chemical engineering. Starting at such an old age, I decided that I must practice guitar 6 hours a day to play catch-up, which basically took every second of my waking hours outside of studying, eating, showering, and laundry. The 6-hour daily routine was painful at first. The first couple of hours were fine; I was able to focus and perform the exercises, but then my mind devolved into this state of wandering where random thoughts that don't really matter just pop out of nowhere, such as 'What do others think of me suddenly wanting to pursue music as a career? Will they laugh at me?', 'What if I fail? Will I become a laughingstock for others?', or more trivial matters such as 'What should I eat for lunch today?' or 'Did I say something inappropriate the other day during class?' Needless to say, the remaining hours of the practice became an ordeal for me. As painful as it was, I managed to maintain the 6-hour practice routine for a few more weeks out of passion for music. After those very tormenting weeks, something amazing happened to me.

At first, I found it much easier for me to get into this state of focus,¬†**what I noticed first is that I can learn the stuff much faster now**. What normally took me a few days to learn, give it a scale, a chord, or a lick, I could get them done in a day or two's worth of practices. Certainly, this might be contributed to my level of dexterity getting better, but it almost felt real for me that,¬†**I became smarter by being more focused.**¬†No only that I became more focused, I was also able to sustain it longer. What was 30 minutes of intense focus got extended into 1 hours, 3 hours, and eventually the entire practice session. It was not for another months before I managed to sustain it through the entire session of course, but¬†**once this thing started rolling, it became easier and easier for me.**¬†Not only I was able to sustain the 6-hour practice daily routine, that routine was furthered into 10 hour practice daily routine after I graduated from college and devoted full time into the music career.

The amazing experience did not stop at getting better at guitar playing itself, I found myself to be able to concentrate my mind into a single point, in this case, the sound.¬†**And when I was in that mode, things slows down in front of me, I can sense the tiniest details of the sound**, not just the sound from my own guitar playing, but the surrounding sound in the environment as well.¬†**I also felt a warm flow of energy connecting my brain, my fingers, and my ears, cycling non-stop**. It was very soothing experience, to me, 6 hours of practice was no longer a chore, it became a getaway for me, if not paradise.

Not until a couple years later after reading quite some philosophy books including eastern schools such as Taoism itself and Zen Buddhism, and western schools such as Arthur Schopenhauer did I understand what was happening to me. Simply put, it was¬†**the first stage of achievement towards enlightenment called flow state, or 'in the zone'.**

# 

# What is flow state?

**When a mind is concentrated at a high level, it forgets its own existence and becomes one with the object**. ¬†This is often referred to as flow state, or 'in the zone', a term used to describe a state of deep focus and effortless performance where everything seems to click. It's like¬†**you're so immersed in what you're doing that you lose track of time, self-consciousness fades away, and every action flows naturally without much effort**. In this state, every action feels effortless, and everything seems to align perfectly. It‚Äôs a magical blend of intense focus, intrinsic motivation, and a sense of control over the task at hand.

# Characteristics of the Flow State

1. **Complete Concentration**¬†In flow, your mind is wholly focused on the activity. Everything outside the task fades into the background, your thoughts, worries, and even the passage of time. For example, an artist painting might not realize they‚Äôve been working for hours because they‚Äôre so absorbed in their work.
2. **Merging of Action and Awareness**¬†You feel like there‚Äôs no separation between you and what you‚Äôre doing. A musician might become one with their instrument, or a runner might feel their body and the path beneath them moving in perfect harmony.
3. **Loss of Self-Consciousness**¬†In flow, there‚Äôs no room for self-doubt or overthinking. You‚Äôre not worried about how you look or what others might think. You‚Äôre simply being¬†in the moment.
4. **Distorted Sense of Time**¬†Time either slows down at a moment or speeds up over a duration. Things around you might feel like they are in slow motion, and you might spend hours on a task but feel like only minutes have passed.
5. **Effortlessness and Ease**¬†While the task itself might be demanding, it feels effortless in flow. Every movement and decision seems to arise naturally, without forcing anything.
6. **Intrinsic Reward**¬†The activity itself becomes its own reward. You‚Äôre not driven by external validation or outcomes; instead, the joy of doing the task fuels your motivation.

# 

Simply put,¬†**flow state happens when you're deeply focused on a challenging task, usually one that requires skill**. It's rewarding on its own because not only it helps you master that activity but also shields you from negative feelings like self-doubt, anxiety, and overthinking. It‚Äôs a way to both improve and find peace at the same time.

Interestingly, the concept of flow aligns closely with Taoist philosophy, particularly the practice of Wu Wei (Êó†‰∏∫), or ""effortless action."" Both emphasize aligning with the natural flow of life and achieving harmony by letting go of resistance and overthinking. Just as Taoism encourages living in harmony with the Tao, flow involves syncing your mind and body with the task, allowing everything to unfold naturally. So in Taoism, flow state is part of the Wu Wei practice where enlightenment is set as the ultimate goal.

Flow state is an incredible experience, but it has its limits, that it can only be triggered while performing a skill-intensive task. But what if someone could enter this state of deep focus and presence at will, like flipping a switch, without needing to engage in those activities? This is where the journey transitions to¬†**the second stage of achievement towards enlightenment: mindfulness.**

# What is mindfulness?

Mindfulness is¬†**the ability to enter a flow state-like mode without needing to engage in a skill-demanding task**. Unlike flow state, which requires intense focus on an activity to reach that state of deep immersion, mindfulness allows you to tap into a similar sense of presence and peace at any time, no matter what you‚Äôre doing.

In mindfulness, you don‚Äôt rely on external tasks to quiet your mind or fully engage your awareness. Instead,¬†**much like the intense focus of the flow state, you simply observe the present moment with full attention**; whether it‚Äôs the rhythm of your breath, the sensations in your body, or the sounds around you. It‚Äôs as if you‚Äôre tapping into the clarity and calm of the flow state, but without needing a specific trigger, your mind itself becomes the focus.

This makes mindfulness incredibly versatile and powerful.¬†**It can be practiced during everyday activities, like walking, eating, or even waiting in line**. Over time, it becomes a tool to find balance and focus even in the most chaotic or mundane situations, offering a sustainable way to stay centered without the need for external conditions to be perfect.

It was only after years of intensive guitar practice and heavy reading that I one day realized I could do this. The euphoria I felt was incredible, it feels like unlocking a hidden superpower.¬†**From that moment on, I have never experienced a single night of difficulty falling asleep, no matter how bad the situation is, be it career struggles, financial issues, or personal hardships**.

Whenever I lie down, I naturally enter this state of mindfulness, and all my thoughts simply drift away. It feels like I become a feather floating in mid-air, gently swaying with the motion of a soft breeze, moving left and right in a soothing, lullaby-like rhythm. This calming sensation has allowed me to fall asleep within five minutes every single time. Unless I have had one too many cups of coffee, of course.

**Another incredible benefit of being able to enter mindfulness is that I never feel bored anymore**, even when working on mundane tasks like data entry during the early days of starting my first business. By simply shifting my focus to the present moment, the sound of the keyboard clicking, the rhythm of my fingers typing, or even the small details on the screen, I find myself fully engaged, almost as if the boring task itself transforms into something fun. Mindfulness turns even the most tedious chores into opportunities for calm and presence, making boredom a thing of the past.

The third benefit of this 'superpower' is the ability to channel negative thoughts into positive ones.¬†**When negativity creeps in, whether it's anger, self-doubt, anxiety, frustration or depression, mindfulness provides a way to pause and redirect those thoughts**. Instead of fighting them, I observe them without judgment by entering mindfulness, almost like watching clouds pass in the sky. This simple act creates space between me and the negativity, allowing me to 'quarantine' it. By doing so,¬†**a setback becomes a lesson, a failure turns into growth, and uncertainty becomes a chance for curiosity**.

But of course, the ability to channel these negative thoughts is its own craft, requiring years of practice and patience to master.¬†**Much like using an instrument to create beautiful music, mindfulness is merely a tool to orchestrate this great symphony of peace of mind**. It takes time to learn how to harmonize conflicting thoughts and emotions, to turn noise into melody. Mindfulness provides the foundation, but it‚Äôs through intentional practice and reflection that one can truly conduct this inner symphony, transforming life's chaos into a steady rhythm of balance and clarity.

The final benefit of this state of mindfulness is that your senses become much sharper. Colors appear more vivid, sounds feel richer, and even the texture of simple things, like the fabric of your clothes or the coolness of a breeze, becomes more noticeable. Simply put, it‚Äôs a higher level of awareness.¬†**When you reach this state, you realize how limited your senses used to be, almost like an animal confined to a very narrow range of perception**. The world now feels bigger, richer, and more vibrant, and you can fully immerse yourself in the present moment like never before. You start to experience the world with a heightened awareness, as if a fog has been lifted. This heightened perception allows you to fully engage with the present moment, appreciating life‚Äôs subtle details that often go unnoticed. It‚Äôs like switching from a blurry, dim lens to crystal-clear, high-definition vision, making even the simplest experiences feel meaningful.

**Meditation is the most common practice to learn mindfulness**¬†because it provides a structured way to train your mind to focus on the present moment. By setting aside time for meditation, you create a dedicated space to observe your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations without judgment. This practice develops the mental clarity and awareness that are at the heart of mindfulness. Meditation isn‚Äôt the only way to practice mindfulness, but it‚Äôs one of the most effective. Over time, the skills developed in meditation naturally expand into other areas of your life, allowing you to experience mindfulness in everything you do.

My path to mindfulness was accidental. I did not know what mindfulness meant until I had reached it by comparing the things I could do to what it enables. So, it might offer some insightful knowledge to those still on the journey to achieving it. One way to begin is by reaching the flow state through practicing a challenging skill first, to get a taste of how mindfulness feels, and then working from there to apply the same level of focus to every aspect of daily life, no matter how trivial. Another thing I did right was that I read a lot history and philosophy classics, with the¬†[*Tao Te Ching*](https://www.taooflife.org/post/tao-te-ching-translation)¬†being one of them. This, I believe, helped me significantly, although I understand that it‚Äôs not for everyone. In short, there is no fixed route to mindfulness.¬†**Everyone walks a different path, so don‚Äôt try to find the ‚Äúbest way‚Äù or a ‚Äúshortcut.‚Äù Instead, work with whatever resonates with you**.

Now the final stage before achieving enlightenment, it is something I vaguely sense but am not 100% sure of its existence, and I might not be able to get there even if it is real. Currently mostly based on my speculation, It is¬†**the full ability to control consciousness at will.**

# Our conscious and subconscious mind

Our mind is made of consciousness and subconsciousness. According to most psychological models, the conscious mind represents only a small portion of our overall awareness, while the subconscious mind encompasses a much larger domain. The subconscious holds memories, beliefs, and patterns that are not actively in focus yet significantly influence our behavior. In essence, the conscious mind is like the visible tip of an iceberg, while the subconscious forms the vast majority hidden below the surface.

Once we reach a level where we can enter mindfulness at will, it becomes possible to explore the next step: attempting to control our consciousness.¬†**While the subconscious mind may seem uncontrollable, it can still be influenced through conscious effort**. The subconscious can be understood as an accumulation of thoughts, ideas, beliefs, experiences, and memories formed over the years. By adjusting our perspective, which is an inherent function of consciousness, we can begin to ""make sense"" of this vast reservoir and indirectly shape its influence on our behavior and perceptions.

# So what does it mean to control the consciousness?

The first level of control over consciousness is the ability to pause and unpause it at will. In Taoism,¬†*Zuowang (ÂùêÂøò)*, or 'sitting and forgetting', is an essential spiritual practice that embodies this concept.¬†**Zuowang represents a level beyond the practice of mindfulness**, where the practitioner seeks to stop the consciousness entirely instead of entering a flow state, a state of channeling all consciousness into a singular point of focus.

So, what is it like to stop your consciousness? I've only been able to achieve this for less than a couple of years. From my experience, you can make your mind 'blank' at will.¬†**When the mind goes blank, you shift into the role of a pure observer, fully present to both the internal and external worlds**. Although not exactly the same, this state aligns with the 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's theory of the 'will-less' state, where one transcends desires and personal drives, entering a realm of pure perception and detached awareness.

There are obvious benefits to the ability to stop consciousness.

**The first benefit is that you gain almost full control over your temper, mood, and thoughts.**¬†When negativity creeps in, you don‚Äôt need to channel these feelings elsewhere by redirecting your focus to a task or a thought, whether that‚Äôs achieving a flow state or practicing mindfulness.¬†**You simply put a stop to consciousness itself, allowing those negative feelings to dissipate.**¬†Individuals who attain this level of mastery over their consciousness will notice their temper becomes moderated and they develop immunity to provocation.¬†**They will act spontaneously in any situation, no longer hindered by feelings of nervousness, intimidation, or awkwardness, which often stem from self-consciousness.**

Moreover,¬†**these individuals do not feel the need to rise above others, to triumph over them, or to express themselves for validation**. Such desires typically arise from a consciousness driven by bodily urges, leading to a state of perpetual uneasiness, anxiety, and frustration. By relinquishing these needs, they create a sense of inner calm that allows for deeper self-awareness and a more harmonious existence.

This ability fosters an environment in which external pressures and societal expectations lose their grip.¬†**Those who can stop consciousness often find themselves free from the burden of competing with others, enabling them to pursue their passions and interests for their own sake rather than for external approval**. This shift in perspective cultivates a kind of contentment that is neither dependent on success nor disturbed by failure.

As a result, they become more resilient in the face of life‚Äôs challenges. Without the constant fluctuations brought on by mood and desire, they can navigate adversities with a peace of mind. This newfound resilience allows them to engage with their surroundings fully, appreciating experiences as they come rather than filtering them through a lens of comparison or striving.

**Another good thing about being able to pause the consciousness is to fill the mind with pure happiness.**¬†By stopping the consciousness, the body and mind become one, and thus in perfect harmony with one another,¬†**once this state is established, there are waves of joy spurt out from within the chest**. This state is much like an infant, whose consciousness is still undeveloped due to the absence of accumulated building blocks such as memory and experience. Like an infant, one returns to a state of pure being, untainted by mental clutter, judgments, or external pressures, experiencing life in its most natural and unfiltered form.

It is the pure form of happiness that requires no reason, no longer one needs the stimulation of earthly achievements such as money, power, and fame to be content. Especially when the latter often bring more suffering than happiness. Speaking of which, let's reach a little further on the topic since we are already here. Does this mean we should not seek earthly success? The answer is that it doesn't matter, but we do need money for our overall well-being, so it is not a bad idea to seek money. As for the other two, it depends on the lifestyle you choose, if your path is politics, yes, then seek power; if you are an actor, your main practice is through acting, then yes, seek fame. What we seek is not important, the important thing is that we walk the path not sacrificing the true happiness.¬†[The way to pursue money, power, and fame without compromising this core value is what Wu Wei practice all about, you can read more about it in this other article.](https://www.taooflife.org/post/what-is-wu-wei-and-why-it-is-good-for-us)

# The next level of controlling the consciousness is reconstruct the consciousness at will.

**Since I have yet to achieve this level, much of what I share below is based on speculation**. Following the ability to pause consciousness, the next natural step would likely involve the capacity to reconstruct it at will.

# What does it mean to reconstruct consciousness?

**First of all, consciousness relies on the continuous stream of information provided by the senses to exist**. The normal process of its formation is as follows: sensory inputs from the external world are collected, processed, and integrated into a coherent experience. These inputs are then interpreted by the mind, giving rise to thoughts, emotions, and an awareness of the present moment, collectively known as consciousness.

Reconstructing consciousness, on the other hand, represents the opposite process.¬†**It is an advanced ability to control the mind so powerfully that it can actively influence and ""backfeed"" the senses, shaping the sensory experience according to the consciousness it chooses to reconstruct**. In this state, the practitioner reverses the flow of influence, using the mind to redefine perception, creating a subjective reality shaped by intentional thought rather than raw sensory data.

Does this sound too sci-fi? It‚Äôs not. In fact,¬†**there‚Äôs a very common and age-old method of reconstructing consciousness called art**. Art, in all its forms, is a deliberate act of shaping perception, allowing the artist to implant their consciousness into the mind of their audience, effectively reconstructing it. This is why, when we immerse ourselves in a masterpiece, be it a symphony, a novel, a painting, or even a film, we momentarily forget our own existence. We are transported to a different time and space, experiencing the world as the creator once did.

Any skilled artist possesses the ability to transform their consciousness into sensory media, whether through sound, visuals, or words. However, it is the 'quality'¬†of the consciousness they project that determines whether their work becomes popular, resonates deeply with others, or attains the status of a classic. Therefore, an artist passively waits for 'inspiration' to strike before transforming their consciousness into a medium of the senses, and their audience relies on this medium to passively reconstruct a very specific sample of consciousness. This is how we know that¬†**artistic ability is not the same concept as the reconstruction of consciousness we are discussing here, but merely a specific example of it**. It also explains why being a great artist alone is not enough to reconstruct consciousness at will.

# What is it like to be able to reconstruct consciousness?

**The ability to reconstruct consciousness is so profound that the possessor of this gift can perceive the world through the eyes of others, both literally and metaphorically**. They gain the capacity to see what others see, feel what others feel, and experience reality from perspectives entirely different from their own. Remarkably, this ""others"" is not confined to human beings. Instead,¬†**it transcends the human experience, extending its reach to all entities in existence**. From the smallest atom vibrating with its inherent energy to the vast, incomprehensible expanse of the universe, everything carries its own form of ""consciousness,"" a unique fingerprint shaped by its state, function, and existence within the cosmos.

**When one attains such an ability, their understanding of reality shifts from the limited confines of individuality to the limitless interconnectedness of all things**. They are no longer bound by their personal senses or self-centered awareness. Instead, they can tap into the universal flow of information, aligning themselves with the ""consciousness"" of any being, object, or system they desire. Just like Zhuangzi's dream of becoming a butterfly,¬†**the boundaries between self and other begin to blur**. In his dream, Zhuangzi did not know whether he was Zhuangzi dreaming of being a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming of being Zhuangzi. This profound parable speaks to a truth about the nature of consciousness, its fluid, shifting, and interconnected form.

This ability dissolves barriers, leaving the practitioner with an intimate understanding of the fabric of existence, as if they were simultaneously the observer and the observed, the creator and the creation.[¬†In](http://creation.in/)¬†this state, the boundaries between ""self"" and ""other"" evaporate. A rock, seemingly inanimate, reveals its ancient story through its molecular vibrations. A tree shares its silent dialogue with the wind and the whispers of the earth beneath its roots. A distant star, light-years away, projects its own consciousness through its pulsating energy, carrying tales of its birth, life, and eventual death.¬†**Even the universe itself, vast and eternal, breathes with a consciousness so immense it defies comprehension, yet one who reconstructs consciousness can feel its pulse, like a faint echo reverberating through eternity**.

The implications of such an ability are staggering.¬†**Imagine understanding the struggles of another person intimately, not just through empathy or observation, but by actually becoming¬†them in a sense, albeit temporarily**. Grasping their fears, their joy, their pain, not as an outsider but as if they were your own. It shifts the notion of communication from mere words to a profound unity of understanding, a complete dissolution of misunderstanding. Beyond the human plane, it allows one to sync with the rhythm of nature, to understand and harmonize with ecosystems, and perhaps even tap into the wisdom of the universe, Tao, itself.

Ultimately, to reconstruct consciousness is to engage in a sacred dance with existence. It is a journey that deepens one's relationship with the universe, revealing the truth that everything is connected, everything is alive in its own way, and everything has a story to tell, and through this ability, one can listen, understand, and even join that story, becoming a co-creator in the infinite tapestry of being.

# Beyond the ultimate control of consciousness

The flow state, mindfulness, and consciousness control are like Matryoshka dolls, where each subsequent layer contains the previous one. This means that the path to enlightenment is not linear. You reach the next level without leaving the previous one, which can be analogized to a pyramid structure, in which the previous level serves as the stepping stone, or foundation, for the next level.

**They serve as a toolkit for us to forge our path to enlightenment, the ultimate state of becoming one with Tao's manifestation in our universe ‚Äî nature**. Once we have gathered all three tools, flow state, mindfulness, and consciousness control, we can apply them in our daily lives to uncover the profound meaning of the Tao.

To do this,¬†**we begin by gathering building blocks: insights gleaned from reading, emotions stirred by appreciating art, music, and literature, reasoning developed through thinking, and feelings evoked by memories accessed during flow states**. Each of these components offers valuable perspectives and deepens our understanding of existence.

Using mindfulness,¬†**we then organize these building blocks, cultivating an awareness that allows us to see how these elements interconnect**. Mindfulness encourages us to be present with our experiences, providing clarity and enhancing our ability to reflect on what we've gathered.

Finally,¬†**we employ consciousness control to reconstruct our understanding of the universe's consciousness**. This transformative process enables us to weave together the insights and emotions we‚Äôve collected, allowing us to perceive the richness of life through the lens of the Tao. By aligning ourselves with this universal consciousness, we not only gain deeper insights into our own existence but also foster a sense of unity with all that is.

In this way, our toolkit becomes a mean of exploration and connection, guiding us toward a more profound comprehension of Tao, the nature and our place within its vast manifestation. Only then can we say that we are enlightened.",0,1738334667.0,Mindfulness,0,0.5,False

1ieg72s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lawyertalk/comments/1ieg72s/dealing_with_partners/,Dealing with Partners,"Hi everyone, 

I‚Äôm not usually one to post but I really am at a loss. I‚Äôm a 25 year old female new associate (passed the bar July 2024) and have been working at my mid-sized firm for 6 months now. 

Long story short, there is one partner in my practice group that is unbelievably rude to me and literally only me. She will ask all the other (older) associates to lunch, coffee, etc. and will walk right past my open door and completely ignore me. She‚Äôs always making comments about the fact that I didn‚Äôt go to an Ivy League school, and is constantly dismissive when I ask questions or even just make small talk. 

I get along perfectly with every other partner and the other associates. I know I shouldn‚Äôt let one bad apple ruin the group but it is really bothering me. 

Any advice on how to handle this? TIA. ",5,1738334292.0,Lawyertalk,6,0.86,False

I'd like an actual conversation.

Best way to get my attention is via a DM. I'm likely not gonna be checking replies/notifications on this post.

Hobbies of mine include:  
Video Games - Recently beat Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, and (ugh) Veilguard. Lately I've been playing a bunch of Marvel Rivals and No Man's Sky while I wait for some of the new games coming out in a month or so.

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsessions are the Terrifier and Smile series.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions. Jamming out of a lot of 80's rock lately, as well.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that. RIP my poor Niners.

The parking lot wasn't full and there wasn't anyone in his truck that hinted at a fight.

Regardless, I felt instinctive, primal caution and sped walked the other direction, jumped into my car, locked it and zoomed out of the parking lot. I didn't have anything on me aside from my cup of coffee and knew that if he wanted to run me down and attack me, he could've.

My story is tamed though. I've heard much worse road and parking lot incidents. Especially from other women of colour who had disgusting racist encounters. The current political climate has also emboldened these people even further.

tl;dr chatGPT go brrrr

  
Since exiting the military I've been floating around the veteran community and noticing a common pain point found in the ranks is resume prep.  In my current role as a developer I am involved in the hiring process for software developers at different levels and have been able to see and review a good amount of veteran resumes.  (The industry I work for seems to attract us). 



Usually when we get in the room we can knock the interviews out of the park.  I attribute success here to crusty old CSMs and company 1SG giving us the stink eye as we bellow out the soldiers creed or NCO creed at boards and trying not to look like a complete dumbass. 

  
The biggest problem often stems from how to translate our military experience into language that is simple to digest for non-military persons in the corporate world to understand and envision how that helps the company their hiring for.  

  
I know some people in our forces are not technically savvy... Honestly some of us are completely illiterate... so I'm trying to help. 



What to do:  Write the experience you're trying to highlight on your resume in simple English 

>In Afghanistan I was apart of at team that obtained biometrics data on the terrorists we captured during patrols. Doing this I would collect DNA samples as well as finger prints and take a scan of their eyes. This led to the identification and capture of high value targets while we released lower value to our afghan partners for processing. 

  
Using a tool like chatGPT or your favorite A.I. (I don't recommend deepseek). Attach this prompt to the end of what you wrote to be bullet pointed on your resume.

>I need a concise, ATS-friendly resume bullet point that translates my military experience for civilian hiring managers

  
Doing so transforms the word salad I wrote above of my experience into this: 

>Conducted biometric data collection in field operations, capturing DNA samples, fingerprints, and iris scans to identify and track high-value targets. Assisted in intelligence efforts by enrolling individuals into a biometric database, supporting data-driven decision-making for security operations. Collaborated with local partners to process and assess individuals, ensuring efficient threat assessment and risk management.

  
Now for the record that blurb is to long for a resume bullet point.  I made it that way to show the prompt in action.  It transformed the nonsense I said into a sample with things like action verbs and other good stuff. 

  
There are other things you can do to ensure success converting the application/resume review step into interviews but this post is long enough and I've already spent to much time not working and doing this instead.

I live on my own, so I meal prep, but not many meals that serve as breakfast or lunch freeze and thaw well. Even since I'm making burritos, life has gotten easier. No longer needing to spend much time to create a healthy breakfast at 14:00, just throwing one in the microwave and toast it in a pan. Along with a cup of filter coffee, I also have a protein shake with it (I love the banana flavor, sometimes I add cacao and it tastes like those flavored straws you drink milk through). At moments I feel creative and energetic, I make these in bulk. I fill them with rice that is slightly undercooked so it doesn't get soggy, along with a mixture of canned beans, fresh bell peppers, yellow onion, spicy spices and a tiny bit of tomato sauce for consistency and flavor. I also like to mix in cr√®me fraiche and the cheese (old cheese dissolves well), to save time and messiness filling the burrito. It also more equally flavors the burrito. Sometimes, I will add fresh spinach to the sauce. I do believe this is making it nog only look healthier, but it also makes me feel better than without it.

Of course the burrito could be stuffed with anything else, like salmon, lentils, curry, eggs and bacon, and I have so much I have left to explore. The burrito really is the perfect food for me because:
It's portable
You can make it healthy
You can vary with the ingredients
It stays warm for some time
It freezes and thaws well
It's easy to prepare in bulk
It doesn't (have to) make a mess when you eat it
There is minimal cleanup
The burrito wrap itself doesn't get soggy
I strongly dislike affordable supermarket breads, and even the sourdough bread is very limiting in terms of what healthy (affordable) things you put on it. It can also not be prepared in advance and it's expensive.",7,1738333892.0,CasualConversation,5,1.0,False

1ieg1k5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1ieg1k5/physical_symptoms/,Physical symptoms,"
My husband walks up to me this morning, sipping coffee on the couch, to tell me that he *heard* me grinding my teeth last night. He was almost sheepish in suggesting I should wear my mouthguard again. I don‚Äôt want to wear my mouthguard again, he knows this. I recently told my therapist I was avoiding it because I didn‚Äôt want to regress ‚Äì I hate how physical and visceral my trauma is. That it literally sweats out of my pores and lives in between my joints, like spinal fluid.

There have been so many physical reactions, outside of the basic (terrifying) nightmares and flashbacks. I still remember the way the stylist giggled when she cut my hair, three months after I‚Äôd escaped them for good. Half of my hair had blown out in a ring around my head, baby hairs exploding outwards in the hot air; it had grown in twice as thick.

Six months after that, I was sweating so heavily in my sleep, that I slept with towels and a spare shirt or two. This happened every night for at least a month, maybe several. Reddit told me that it wasn‚Äôt my CPTSD, but it coincided with a three-week period that evened out over the next twelve months. I bled for so long, I considered the hospital; I started a tracking app instead and found my cycle slowly bouncing down to a consistent four weeks. My period came early again only recently ‚Äì I had been ambushed by aunts. I rarely sweat through a shirt at night now.

I‚Äôd always had stomach aches; as far back as grade four I would leave school early to hang with the babysitter. These were particularly sharp during anxious mornings after I escaped. A little over one year and many, many countries away from my abusers, I started throwing up. I found myself somewhere safe, somewhere that finally felt like home, and I threw up all day long. I thought I had contracted a mysterious stomach flu or food poisoning, but when I got sick again a few weeks later (and my husband who I did everything with was fine), we realized it must be trauma related. This happened six more times that I can think of. Once, when I landed back in the city of my abusers, again, when I reintegrated with my teenage memories. Another night, I dislocated a rib puking after a particularly intense therapy session. I don‚Äôt remember what we talked about.

Almost two years after I had cut out my abusers, I went in for a routine eye check and found that my lifelong prescription (of 20 years) had dropped in half. I am blown away each time my body does something without me. Does the body keep score? Probably. But it also heals, the body wants to be healthy.

If I get triggered ‚Äì abused, reminded, whatever ‚Äì my hands still shake and my legs tremble in a way that makes it hard to stand. I had a small attack the other day and let myself be non-functional and stream all day afterwards. This turns off my brain‚Ä¶ but apparently not my teeth. I had to experiment to make the grinding noise my husband heard; I discovered that I am hooking and pulling my jaw back and down, ripping my teeth against each other. It‚Äôs almost violent. Louder than my nightmares, apparently.

We boiled the mouthguard, refit it, and set it by the nightstand. I poured another coffee, packed my special CBD-blend bowl, and sat down to write it out. One traumatized fucking day after the other. ",1,1738333850.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

""What the--"" I exclaimed, bumping my knee up the table as I watched the TV turn on

""A disturbing pattern has emerged in recent weeks, leaving law enforcement baffled and the community on edge.  Multiple homicides have occurred, all involving victims fitting a strikingly similar profile: 45-year-old men with brown hair.  While authorities are hesitant to officially label this a serial killing spree, the uncanny similarities between the cases are raising serious concerns.""

I raised my eyebrow at that. Last week, Mom talked about my father for the first time. He left when she was pregnant with me. She described him clearly: about 45 years old, with brown hair, hazel eyes, and a crooked smile. The description felt strangely familiar, but also very different. It was the first time that I had heard about him in my life. Shocking isn't it?

""Weird"" I muttered as I turned to look at Bingo. He meowed and went back to licking his butt in the corner of the living room. 

The door opened, and I smiled as I saw my mom, hanging her coat and putting down her briefcase. Her head hung down low as she walked towards me.

""Charlotte, listen to me."" She muttered as her worried eyes looked at me, and both her hands were placed on my shoulders. ""Lock your doors at night, and always, always take your medicine. From now on, I'm homeschooling you.""

""Yes, Mom,"" I nodded and put my hands up in defense ""Have you heard of the killings?'

""I'm going to bed, Charlotte; I'm tired; let me rest. And you should too."" She declared, and then she was off to her room next to the basement.

That's how it always was; I'd ask questions, and she'd avoid them. I was sick of it. I wanted to break her stupid rules for once.

I went over to my room and pretended to close my door loudly so my mom would hear. I sat on my bed, waited a few minutes, and went over to the door and opened it.

My unease deepened.  Driven by a growing dread, I discovered a hidden compartment in the hallway, revealing a complex code.  It wasn't easy to find; it took a few minutes of searching. The code unlocked the basement door, its heavy wood groaning open.

I hesitated at the top of the creaking stairs, the musty smell of damp earth and something else filling my nose. Slowly, but surely, I made my way downstairs and made sure to find a light source. Then, I saw a desk.

The basement contained a well-organized collection of horror. Files were filled with medical reports, police sketches, and news articles. Each document described a gruesome crime scene, with the recent victims matching my mother's description of my father. Others went back fifteen years and matched the time we arrived in Havenwood.

Holy crap.

Then I thought, maybe, just maybe, my mom was the killer? Stupid, I know. But ever since she told me about Dad last week, my suspicions were raised. And then it dawned on me. The fact that there were almost no killings in our town until we moved in, the recent killings of 45-year-old men. 

I had to get out of here

Panic seized me. I stumbled out of the basement, grabbed my phone, and fumbled for the keys to our car. I dialed 911, my voice trembling. ""This is Charlotte Smith, I think my mother is a serial killer. There's evidence in our basement‚Ä¶""

The dispatcher spoke calmly and professionally, but I couldn‚Äôt concentrate. I hung up, feeling dizzy and my heart racing. I needed to get away.

As I drove past unsuspecting cars, my headache got worse. The time on the dashboard glowed ominously: 7:15 PM. A wave of nausea washed over me.. My whole body trembled and my head twitched. As time passed by, voices suddenly spoke in my ear.

Kill. Kill. Kill dad.

As I drove for what felt like an eternity, I suddenly heard police sirens behind me. What the hell??

My heart raced in my chest, pounding like a drum against the noise of the engine. The red and blue lights flashed in the rearview mirror, creating a chaotic scene and blurring the shapes of the grass speeding past.

The police car swerved sharply in front of me, its tires screaming in protest, forcing my car to a halt. The sudden stop sent my head snapping forward, the seatbelt digging into my chest. My body trembled, my muscles seizing, my mind consumed by an urge.

My vision was starting to fade

""Charlotte Smith, you are arrested for serial murder and possession of weapons. We have evidence placing you at the scene and linking you to the crime. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you. Do you understand your rights?""

They pulled me from the car, and the handcuffs felt cold against my wrists. The detective's voice droned on, reading my rights in a way that made no sense. My mother arrived with a look of deep sadness and understanding. She tried to talk and explain, but her words got lost as darkness overwhelmed me. 

The last thing I saw before the darkness claimed me completely was my mother's face, contorted in a silent scream of horror and recognition. Then, the darkness. And then‚Ä¶ something else. A cold, sharp awareness, utterly alien, yet undeniably...mine.",1,1738333645.0,ScaryStory,0,1.0,False

How should I do it with her?,"So for personal reasons I wont mention where it is, but im grateful that my crush likes me back. The signs are obvious, the problem now is she is giving me signs of frustration of ""how come ur not asking me out"" which happened last week when i was talking to her. Obviously I dont put all my eggs in one basket and flirt and pursue her like shes the only girl in the world, but i still want to see how our relationship would work out if we did eventually date, because i love her that much.

They said ""cuffing season"" starts from October until end of March. She gets flirted on, hit on daily, and other guys who she hasn't event met often come out/pop out of nowhere to ask her out, and she rejects 100% of them. Its funny to watch their attempts, but anyways lets get back on topic here. But lately since she is very hot, and the timing right now of cuffing season, competition between me and other guys wont ever end until she finally gets a boyfriend, since she IS THAT ATTRACTIVE. I would say she is a 9 out of 10.   
  
Having 1-on-1 time with her is impossible, unless you literally stalk her, or ask her if u can talk to her, which could backfire since I'm just as busy as her. But I give it 1-2 weeks where we are both tired of the friend zone within each other and I want to ask her out, but if the 2 usual guys that talk to her daily (both ugly btw, they just keep pursuing to see if they can get lucky) then theres other guys that simp to have her time, making it hard for me to even build a friendship with her.

long story short, the best times for me to talk to her OR ask her out is on the second floor where she makes coffee for herself, or warms up her lunch. The other option which I dont like, but I might have to pursue is in the cafeteria. Her heartbeat literally flutters near the refrigerators where we store out lunches, and she acknowledged my presence and moves slower when im around her there. I dont care anymore if she rejects me, since I have coped with rejection before. I just wanna ask her out on February because I honestly think we can have something going if she says yes.",1,1738333601.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1iefy1t,https://github.com/tanq16/expenseowl,Release of ExpenseOwl - Extremely Simple Expense Tracking,"[ExpenseOwl](https://github.com/tanq16/expenseowl) is a simple expense tracker with a monthly pie chart of categorized spending.

I initially made it for personal use but some folks showed interest in another thread (thanks to them for 2 feature requests). So I wanted to share here.

It's very minimal as I never used most features in other incredible apps like Actual and Firefly. The idea is simple - add expense (just category and amount, even name is optional), see a monthly pie chart, and that's it! No budgeting, no accounts, no tags.

Short ""about"" section:
- Everything lives in a single JSON file
- Custom categories (just set EXPENSE_CATEGORIES=""Rent,Food,Coffee,Fun"" etc)
- Mobile-friendly UI with dark/light themes
- Available as a multi-arch Docker image
- Works as a PWA for easy phone access
- 2 views: pie chart view and table view

Tip: You can click a category in the pie chart legend to exclude it (nice for seeing spendin without rent/fixed category).

If you like keeping things simple, you might dig it too! Thanks for hearing out, have a great weekend!",1,1738333570.0,selfhosted,0,0.67,False

1iefvvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diverticulitis/comments/1iefvvo/one_week_post_surgery_update/,One week post surgery update,"48F. I am on day 8 post surgery to remove 26‚Äù of my colon (entire sigmoid and well as 14‚Äù of bonus redundant colon, I‚Äôve always been an overachiever lol) and for fun my appendix was also removed. 

The good news, no bag, and surgery was able to remain robotic assist. The bad? My surgeon was correct, my colon (and appendix) was adhered in its entirety to the sidewall of my abdomen. I guess that‚Äôs bad? I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs complicated my recovery at all. 

Now let‚Äôs talk complications‚Ä¶ we all know there are risks‚Ä¶ and I checked the box for every single possible complication that would just make it suck a tad bit more, but not make it the worst experience of my life lol

Hypotension‚Ä¶ extended my hospital stay three days longer than it would have. Day of surgery my blood pressure tanked to 60/40 and stayed ‚Äúsoft‚Äù for 3 days. This just kept me confined to my room and my walks short and sweet. Only being allowed to walk to the bathroom and back to my bed. Even with not being able to walk as much as recommended the ‚Äúgas‚Äù pain still only lasted two days. Every other follow up you‚Äôve read has been accurate‚Ä¶ THAT is the worst part. 

Hematoma, because why not? The entirety of my lower abdomen pooled with blood day 2, accompanied by a low grade fever. Considered a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù complication. This just requires constant monitoring of pain, color and fever; as well as around the clock ice packs. Honestly the anxiety and fear is the worst part. I have been instructed to take the pain meds 24 hours a day, but I barely took them prior to being instructed to do so. Now, please keep in mind that I‚Äôve always had an absolutely wicked pain tolerance. So my experience probably won‚Äôt match most in the same situation. 

I am staying with family, not because I need help, but because I need a babysitter to make sure that I don‚Äôt do too much. A fact they all find hilarious. 

I‚Äôve had zero issues with bowel movements or gas, everything as far as that goes have been picture perfect. That‚Äôs with colace twice a day as a preventative due to the hematoma. 

I‚Äôve been drinking coffee, free to eat an unrestricted diet, only told to try not to go wild with high fiber foods. This hasn‚Äôt been an issue because I really don‚Äôt have any kind of appetite. I‚Äôve been supplementing with protein drinks to help feed my body. 

I have a total of 6 incisions. 5 for the robot and one larger (4‚Äù) for removal of the colon. Laying down is still a no. I sleep on a chaise, and have managed to train my brain to keep moving my legs to (hopefully) prevent any blood clots. So far so good. 

I don‚Äôt know what else to include. I found these posts so comforting leading up to my surgery. Yes, even the ones that had the worst case scenarios because that helped me feel prepared for my own procedure. I felt empowered to face whatever came my way, and I am fortunate enough that my ‚Äúcomplications‚Äù weren‚Äôt even that complicating. I still have to remind myself that it‚Äôs still only been a week, and there‚Äôs still a ways to go. 

Rest assured, my post op pain still pales in comparison to the majority of the complicated infections that I‚Äôve had the last few years leading up to my surgery. For that I am so grateful. ",4,1738333391.0,Diverticulitis,4,1.0,False

Im overwhelmed by the things I have to consider and the overall price in the end is much higher than anticipated/written out right.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Im located in middle Europe. I found out down the road, that I will probably need COC certificate. According to two manufacturers, this means they need to use some German company's parts (AL-KO) and this of course brings additional cost.

Models Im looking at:

End price including the product, AL-KO parts, COC certificate, shipping (DDP with tax) = around 15k EUR.

First of all, maybe someone can weight in about 1) the price, how do they feel about it. I didnt try to negotiate a better price as of now, as I dont want to make decisions before im absolutely sure, and I dont think its nice to negotiate until you are ready to buy.

2) Im interested if anyone bought from any of these two companies, and how satisfied you were. Maybe also describe your experience with other vehicle imports to EU, and how strict/regulated and which hidden costs you incured upon getting it.

3) If anyone knows of any subreddit or community, that does trailer renovations, please tell me about them. Te only thing I found was r/foodtrucks, but I dont want a truck but rather a trailer.

4) The sellers provided different options for shipping. One was FOB, and then we were also talking about other costs (insurance etc.) to come to the DDP+tax cost. Is the insurance I get from this good, how likely is it that i will get screwed, either by the product not arriving or the product being downright a scam (shit quality or something like that). Since I doubt sending the trailer back to the manufacturer will be financially feasible, I want to account for this risk as well.

So I made a couple of posts earlier this week in some other threads talking about my experience with a pretty uncommon sleep aid, and it kind of blew up. (You can find these posts on my profile) A ton of people chimed in with their own experiences, and a lot of people had no idea this even existed. Some were skeptical, some had wild success stories, and a few straight-up called me crazy lol. So I wanted to bring this discussion over here to get your thoughts.

I‚Äôve dealt with insomnia on and off for most of my life. This started as a young child and has persisted into my mid twenties. Just like many of you I have tried everything - melatonin, magnesium, sleep hygiene, teas, meditation, talk therapy, excercise, etc, etc. And TBH many of these things have helped in their own ways and are still a regular part of my regiment. But nothing has ever truly helped me scratch that itch. There is an occasional night where I will sleep for 7 or 9 hours but this is very rare. I am usually averaging around 4-6 and I don't think I have one of those genetic predispositions to only need this amount of sleep. I feel okay at 6 hours, like dog crap at 4, and stellar at 7 or 8. 

  
Then about a month or so ago I came across an ad that sparked my interest. I went to these dudes website where the owner was talking about a mushroom that he used to get off of benzos. Apparently there is a whole new market emerging around this mushroom - Amanita Muscaria. They market it as a ""different kind of microdose"" that is suppose to be really good for sleep and anxiety. I thought it was too good to be true but they had a sale going and it honestly wasnt that expensive for some gummies and raw caps.

Long story short I have been taking this on and off for a few weeks now and I think it is changing my life. ¬†I started taking this mushroom at small doses in the afternoon. Like really small doses. 1 or 2 gummies. TBH I thought I got scammed because I didnt feel relaxed or much at all. Maybe my expectations were too high. But that same night when i was going to sleep I noticed I was very sleepy and happy. It was easy to fall asleep and I slept for almost 9 hours. Felt amazing when I woke up. Had super vivid dreams and could just tell I was getting deep, restorative sleep.

So I started experimenting. I've taken up to 6 of the gummies before in one afternoon. In this experience I actually felt pretty wobbly. Hard to describe. Just super jolly and almost slow motion. I've also taken up to 3 grams of the caps before in one sitting and that was some of the best sleep of my life. I slept for 10 hours straight and was dreaming about this fire and drum circle.

I also started taking small amounts of the raw mushroom throughout my day. It has been probably one of if not the best nootropic I have ever found. I work from home as a freelancer for various businesses and my job requires me to sit at a computer for several hours each day. I really enjoy noopept, and or a small amount of cacao and coffee with L-Theanine. Any nootropic I have taken it feels like I have taken them in the hopes that they would help me fall into the flow state better. And some do an okay job at this. But Amanita here recently is really helping me fall into these flow states throughout my day.

I recently took a week off and noticed for the first few nights afterwards that I was still sleeping really good. But for the past couple nights I'm averaging around 6 or 7 hours. Might hop back on the Amanita here soon. TBH I dont think I experience any backlash or withdrawal effects once I quit cold turkey. I was taking it almost everyday for about 2 weeks. Not saying that people cant - I honestly dont know. Their website seems to claim that it is pretty rare to develop addiction to it and if one does its typically because they are taking really high doses for a long period of time. Once again I dont know how true all of this is for everyone but it lines up with my own personal experience so far.

There's a lot of weird misinformation out there about this mushroom and the more i learn about it and the more I take it myself the more I feel like something has been hidden from us. Not encouraging anyone to be reckless or anything like that. Please always do your research but I did my research before interacting with this little red topped mushroom and I'm super happy I've found it.

So I come now to this forum to hopefully spark another lively debate. Has anyone here tried this mushroom for sleep? What has your experience been like? There is a ton of people in the other threads telling me to watch out, it's neurotoxic, etc, etc. Yet..... there is this whole weird community of people who swear by it, it seems like human beings have been taking it in general for thousands of years now, and my own personal experiences make me feel as if there is more to this mushroom than most people understand. It has super interest pharmacological mechanisms at play. I'm not trying to mislead anyone within this forum to thinking this thing is some magic bullet for everyones sleep issues because I am almost certain it is not. The sleep thing seems to be a very complex and unique journey for everyone. But I've been through the ringer as a human being just trying to get some damn sleep and here as of recently I'm getting the best sleep of my life with it. 

If you've made it this far - thanks for listening <3
