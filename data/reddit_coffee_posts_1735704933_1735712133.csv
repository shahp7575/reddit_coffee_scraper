1hqx3ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hqx3ah/im_getting_fired_lol/,I’m getting fired lol,"( this is my second time typing this cause I deleted the first one on accident 🥲)

So anyways tonight is New Year’s Eve right and I was scheduled to work 5-11pm but like a couple hours into my shift my lead says I can go home so I’m like whatttt they don’t usually let the closers go home. I was really ecstatic to get out of there so I didn’t really ask a lot of questions. And since new years in Cali is amazing I want to leave so fast

I immediately text my friends if they were still down to go out ( I had to cancel since I worked) so I rush to go pick her up and we go out. I start feeling kinda tired so I want to go get a coffee from work so I pull in and the dude taking my order sees me and immediately looks pissed. I’m confused and he says that I wasn’t supposed to go home and he said that some people are mad at me and that apparently I said yes when the lead asks if in off soon( this might have happened as I have horrible hearing and we play music inside) and I’m lowkey getting kinda scared cause I like this job so he finishes taking my order and I go to the window (heart racing cause I overthink everything) a

The dude at the window has not heard any of this lol so that makes me feel better and I tell him that the dude taking my order says that I wasn’t supposed to leave and I asked if they needed any help cause I could go in and help if they really needed it. He’s so confused at this point and I decided to just leave.

I definitely should have questioned more when they said I could leave early but at this point it is what it is. I’m just waiting for that text from my managers saying if we can have a chat.

Also typing this im coming to the conclusion that maybe he was just playing with me, but it makes sense because why would they ever let a closer off early. ",1,1735711845.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1hqwz24,https://www.reddit.com/r/helpme/comments/1hqwz24/why_did_the_barista_memorize_my_number/,Why did the barista memorize my number?,"I recently moved back to my home town and a woman I went to high school with works at a coffee stand in said town. This coffee stand, as with most, have done away with stamp cards and just takes your phone number so their system can track how many drinks you've bought. Now under that pretense I could understand her memorizing it, but here's the kicker, its not like I stop there daily, let alone the fact that I only see her there maybe once or twice a month, not to mention, she had it memorized after just a couple stops. Along with that there's another coffee stand I stop at more frequently (just less out of the way and I get a different type of drink there) with a friend I had from high school who I see 3-4 four times a week and she hasn't memorized my number. Just to point out, I was friends with the woman I see more frequently and never even came close to running in the same crowd as the woman I see way less frequently. I've been back in town for roughly sevenish months now and never thought anything of it till my mom and I stopped there and she just put my number in without asking for it and my mom found that semi suspicious, which has led me here. You see I'm rather introverted and don't like cornering people at work, so I've debated whether or not I should ask her why she has my number memorized. That internal debate led me to the conclusion of just messaging her on Facebook. I messaged her once and she didn't open it for a couple weeks, so I unsent the message and was going to convince myself to just stop in and ask her. It's been a couple months now and I honestly forgot about the whole thing, that was until I stopped back in this last week and she was working, so I retyped out a message and sent it to her, I believe my message was respectful and reasonable, although maybe just a little forward (I'll put the message below). She's read it and hasn't responded. Am I reading the situation wrong? Was messaging the wrong way to go or should I of just asked her while she was working? Or does she just have a freakishly good memory?

The message I sent her:  
""Idk if you can see the message or just the unsent notification and I know I should say this in person (why I unsent it in the first place), but you see I'm quite introverted and am never in the right headspace to be that outgoing when I see you're working, not to mention I hate making people feel cornered at work. That said, I'll just be blunt, I'm extremely thrown off by the fact you seemingly memorized my number, not in a bad way, just that I wouldn't of ever guessed i was ever on your radar, we always ran with dramatically different crowds. With that said, I almost believe you just have a phenomenal memory, yet if that isn't the case and you'd want to talk, I thrive on conversation (something i may be lacking as of late), but if it is the former, feel free to ignore me""",1,1735711341.0,helpme,0,1.0,False
1hqwz0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1hqwz0k/i_think_im_done_finally/,I think I’m done… finally ,"My husband (49) and I (45) have been married for almost 8 years now. 3 months into our marriage I was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and told I had only 18 months to live. I have fought hard and traveled all over the US taking part in brain cancer trials. I have come close to death several times but always bounce back. On September 26, 2023 I discovered that the man I married and praised, put high up on a pedestal because he appeared to be the most loving and supportive human being alive. He could have ran for the hills when I was diagnosed so early on in our marriage but he didn’t. He stayed but I what I discovered on that day, completely flipped my world upside down. Destroying everything I believed in. Shattering me and our marriage. He had been having an affair. I should have been the one running for the hills but I wanted my marriage. I couldn’t picture my future without him in it. I loved him deeply and I tried to tell myself he only stepped out to escape the stress of our reality of me being sick. I tried to tell myself that he truly loved me and I could forgive him as long as he did the work and showed remorse and it never happens again. For the next 8 months, I was ripped apart by not knowing what was real in our marriage and what was fake. I asked him many times for a full disclosure and he kept trickle truthing me. I would only get the truth out of him if and only if I have undeniable evidence and he would still try to wiggle out of it. Until I told him I was done. That’s when he came forward and disclosed that he had been cheating on me since before our marriage and with a total of 9 women. I was devastated once more. Feeling stuck because I had no where to go but also because I loved him. I stayed and kept trying to heal our marriage. He changed his phone number, gave me all passwords to social media and bank accounts. I have full access to his phone and electronics. He installed Life360 and even changed jobs to work from home. None of it seemed to help me with the pain. A few months ago I asked him for a timeline of his infidelities and he promised he would. But then didn’t. I waited awhile and asked him again. I let him know how important it was to me because as of that point I had no timeline to go off of and believed everything in our marriage was fake. He still refused. For the last year and more I have watched nearly every self help video, every healing from betrayal video, countless outs of reading how to heal, joined groups, did EMS online therapy, you name it and I have done it. He did some of it with me but never came to me to discuss what he’s doing on his own. So to me it looked as though he was doing nothing. I have been dealing with triggers, mind movies, nightmares all the things of PTSD trauma . I am extremely triggered by names. Yet I stayed and continued fighting for our marriage. The things he said to these women is unbelievable. I reached out to all of them and actually had coffee with one. I truly feel sorry for them. He lied and manipulated them just as much as he did me. They all had the exact same story. He told them that we were in an open marriage due to my health. He went as far as making an open marriage agreement and signed my name to prove it to them. He told them all that I am top priority and that he would never leave me. And he slept with each one only
Once or twice. Most of these relationships lasted a year to 3 years and one of the women thought he actually loved her and moved from her home state of Michigan to Colorado to be with him and then moved from Colorado to Florida when we moved. Why? Because he told her he loved her. He told most of them he never loved me and that he loved them. He also told them that he had to stay married to me legally or he wouldn’t get any of the malpractice suit when I die. ( that has been fixed legally, he gets absolutely NOTHING now) but it gets worse! He told them “I wish she would hurry up and die so we can be together “ I am disgusted and mentally damaged from that. But yet I stayed. In my mind, grasping on to any and everything possible to give me hope that he actually does love me and didn’t marry me for money and truly doesn’t want me dead, I convinced myself that it was limerence and he only said and done those things out of the stress and great sadness of watching his wife slowly dying. He needed to escape his reality. He was hurting too and didn’t mean those words. He couldn’t process what was happening. After all, he’s still with me. He’s still here even though he knows he gets no money after I’m gone. Why would he stay with me after all of this and our marriage being horrible and my anger and temper and cutting him down so bad that mud has a better value to me than he does now. Why? Unless he really does love me. Right? I asked him again for a timeline and still got nothing. I explained it to him again and told him I didn’t understand why he can’t give me a timeline if he loves me and wants us to heal. No answer. Today I told him that it feels like the only reason he wouldn’t do it is because he’s still hiding something. He’s still lying and when he just looked at me and walked away… everything I ever felt for him walked away right behind him. I have cried so much that I have no more tears. I am exhausted from battling cancer and trying to fix a marriage that I had no choice in. Living a life be dumped on me. And getting bare minimum from him. I have no place to go. I will lose my insurance in the divorce. I probably just signed my own death certificate but even death seems much easier and better than living with the pain he has caused me and chooses to continue causing. I have never met such a selfish person. I am done! 

I just needed to vent. I have no one to talk to and didn’t want to put this on Facebook. Thanks for reading. ",2,1735711336.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

I don’t know why I’m posting this. I guess I just need to get it out. For the past two weeks, I haven’t been able to sleep without hearing footsteps behind me, without jumping at every car that pulls up next to me. There’s a part of me that wants to forget it, but the other part knows I can’t. Maybe writing this down will help me process it.

Two weeks ago, I was living my usual routine. I work from home, so my days blur together. That Friday evening, I had spent hours staring at a screen, replying to emails, and typing up reports. It wasn’t until around 8:30 PM that I realized I was out of coffee. I wasn’t planning on leaving the apartment, but there was nothing else to do, and I really needed coffee if I was going to survive the weekend.

I grabbed my keys, threw on my jacket, and headed out the door. It was the same five-minute walk I took every time I needed something from the corner shop. Nothing special. Just a normal evening, no different than any other.

The streets weren’t particularly busy, but they weren’t deserted either. A few cars were parked along the curb, and I passed a couple of people walking in the opposite direction. The air was crisp, and I could see my breath as I exhaled. I remember thinking how peaceful the evening felt—like one of those quiet moments before something happens that makes you realize you should have been paying more attention.

I didn’t even give the van a second thought when I saw it parked outside the store. It was white, unmarked, with the engine off. There was no one around it. Just an empty van. It wasn’t the first time I’d seen something like that. People park there all the time. I’m sure I wasn’t the only one who thought it was out of place, but I didn’t think much of it.

Inside the store, everything was normal. The aisles were dimly lit, the shelves stocked with the usual items. The cashier barely looked at me when I grabbed my coffee and paid. There were no other customers, and it was oddly quiet. The flickering overhead light gave the place a strange atmosphere, but nothing about it screamed danger. I grabbed my change, said a quick “thanks,” and turned to leave.

When I stepped outside, I saw the van again. The same one. But this time, there was a man standing by it, talking on a cell phone. I remember noticing how he looked like he didn’t fit in with the quiet street—like he was out of place. But again, I didn’t think much of it. People talk on their phones all the time.

I started walking back toward my apartment, my mind on the coffee I was about to make.

And then I heard footsteps.

It was subtle at first, just a soft echo of footsteps behind me. I told myself it was nothing—just someone walking at the same pace. But then it happened again. The footsteps matched mine. Whoever it was was keeping pace with me, walking just a little too close.

I glanced behind me, but didn’t see anyone. I kept walking, trying to push the unease aside. But then the footsteps grew louder. Someone was definitely behind me now. I could hear them clearly, just a step or two behind.

My heart started to race, but I told myself it was nothing. Maybe they were just walking in the same direction, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.

I picked up my pace. The footsteps behind me quickened.

I turned the corner onto my street, walking faster now, almost breaking into a jog. The footsteps matched my every move. My breathing became shallow, and panic set in. I glanced over my shoulder again.

And there he was. The man from the van. He was standing just a few feet behind me now, staring straight ahead. I couldn’t make out his face in the dim streetlight, but something in his posture made my blood run cold. He wasn’t running after me, but he wasn’t walking casually either. He was just… there.

Before I could even process what was happening, he grabbed my arm, pulling me back toward the van. I didn’t scream. I couldn’t. I was frozen, like my body was too terrified to react. His grip tightened around my wrist, and I was dragged across the street, back to that damn van.

I tried to pull away, but I was too weak. He shoved me inside, into the dark, cramped backseat of the van.

I didn’t even have time to think. The man slammed the door shut, and I felt a sharp prick in my neck. My head spun. I didn’t lose consciousness completely, but everything started to blur. My thoughts felt foggy, like I wasn’t sure if what was happening was real or just some kind of nightmare.

The van drove for what felt like an eternity. The road was bumpy, and I could feel every turn. But I couldn’t focus on anything. I couldn’t process what was happening. I was too scared to even scream.

When the van finally stopped, I didn’t know where we were. The men didn’t say anything. They just pulled me out of the van and led me into a small, windowless room. My head was spinning, and I could barely stay upright. I was shoved into a chair, my arms restrained by zip ties. The room was bare—just concrete walls, a single light hanging from the ceiling, and a door that looked too solid to break through.

And then… silence.

It felt like I was in there for hours. No sounds. No voices. No movement. The only thing I could hear was my own heartbeat, thumping loudly in my ears. I kept expecting them to say something, to explain what was happening, but nothing.

No one came in. No one spoke to me. Not even a single question.

I kept thinking, “This can’t be real. They’ll let me go. This is just some mistake.” But the longer I sat there, the more I realized how wrong I was. I wasn’t going anywhere.

Hours passed. I don’t know how long, but it felt like days. I started to lose track of time, and I could feel myself slipping. My hands were numb from the restraints, my mind drifting in and out of clarity.

Finally, someone came into the room. A man in a suit. He didn’t say anything. He just looked at me for a moment, checked something off on a clipboard, and nodded. I wasn’t sure what was going on, but I had the overwhelming sense that I was being watched.

They cut the zip ties. Without a word, they forced me into the van again. I didn’t protest. I didn’t even try to ask questions. I just… followed. I was too exhausted.

The ride back felt shorter. This time, they didn’t stop anywhere. The van drove through quiet streets, and when it finally stopped, they shoved me out of the door and onto the sidewalk.

Just like that.

The door slammed shut behind me, and the van sped off into the night. I was left standing there, not knowing what had just happened, not knowing why.

I stood there for what felt like forever, too afraid to move.

I don’t know how I made it back to my apartment. I don’t remember walking there. My body moved on autopilot. When I got inside, I locked the door and just sat in the dark. I was too terrified to even turn on the lights.

I called the police, but when I told them what happened, they didn’t believe me. They took my statement, but they couldn’t find any evidence. No cameras. No witnesses. Nothing.

I haven’t felt safe since. Every time I leave my apartment, I feel like someone is watching me. Every time I hear a van in the distance, my heart races. I don’t know who those men were or why they took me. But the silence… that silence is the part that haunts me the most.

What were they waiting for? Why didn’t they say a word?

The silence felt deliberate. Like they were testing me. Watching me. Waiting for something.

I still don’t know if they’ll come back. I don’t know if I’m safe. And that uncertainty is the worst part.",1,1735711245.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1hqwsvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1hqwsvp/aimless_very_long_im_sorry/,"Aimless (Very Long, I’m Sorry)","Hello all, this is my first real Reddit post ever, so please be gentle if possible.

Ever since 2022 I’ve been having a rough time. I was married in 2019 to my ex-wife (we are both afab, but I am now nonbinary; I don’t know how she currently identifies, but she was a cis woman when we were together) until we separated in May 2022, a few weeks before my 30th birthday. She wouldn’t say why we were separating, and I asked multiple times for closure. It never came. Fast forward to April 2023 I am living with my parents and (states away) and we officially divorce. Ever since then, now that she no longer needs to communicate with me, she cut me off entirely. This is okay, I understand the desire, even if it crushed me quite a bit — we dated and lived together since 2013 when I was 21 and she was 20. I left my home and family to be with her all those years… only for this to happen. Truthfully, it felt very abrupt. I know a lot of you will say this is the reason (but I think that’s due to a general negative view of this lifestyle) but ever since late November 2021 when I asked if we could maybe open the relationship/be poly (I specifically asked if I could look for a third so we could form a throuple)… she stopped spending as much time with me. She started hanging out with her friends more (which at first I encouraged because I was happy seeing her so happy to socialize — she’s very introverted and thinks poorly of herself sometimes), but it got to the point where I was home alone most nights and she was opting to hang with them, even if we had plans prior. She would say she forgot about the plans and beg to go anyway, and usually I just let her because if she stayed she just poured the whole time and didn’t interact with me at all. I remember the first big fight we had was she was invited to a New Year’s Eve sleepover with ‘the lads’ as she called them. I was like yeah I guess we could go to that, seems weird it’s a sleepover, though. For her to go oh no, it’s just me and the lads — girlfriends and wives aren’t invited. So I looked at her and went so you want me to be alone on New Year’s Eve? What about a midnight kiss for luck (something we always did)? And she whined and complained, saying New Year’s Eve isn’t inherently romantic. So, I let her go. I am physically disabled, so getting around is difficult and nobody was free to come over to spend it with me because most people were invited to parties or with family… so I was all alone for the first time since 2013. Anyways, throughout 2022 she just kept hanging out with this group of friends more and more and she would say you can come, you’re always welcome! But when I expressed interest it was always a ‘lads only’ event or too short notice for me to attend. Sometimes a couple of them would come over. One of them I knew from work and considered him a decent friend… but he began to act weirdly. He would designate chores to me (reminder I’m physically disabled, it’s hard for me to walk and even stand in place) like washing dishes and folding laundry. I could fold the laundry, sure, but it felt so weird he was ordering me around in my own house… he always framed it like I should be helping out around the house more, that I’m putting too much on my ex-wife. So later I would ask her like hey, do you feel like you do too much? Should we maybe budget for perhaps a maid/cleaning service? I try to help out by cooking and cleaning as much as I can, but I’m disabled. I can’t do what an able-bodied person can do. She would always go no!! We don’t need a maid/cleaning service — everything’s fine!! Just keep doing what you can. So I did. Continuing through the year, she would go to impromptu breakfast/brunch with this friend and sometimes the lads on a regular basis. I was never invited. I found this odd, but didn’t want to invade her ‘me time’ as she called it. I will admit I may have commented that I felt lonely/left out a few times, but she never seemed to mind? Usually she would, I’m assuming this is the proper use of the word, love bomb me when I started to question our relationship — “are we doing okay?” “should we go to couple’s therapy?” “do you still love me?” I’d say stuff like that and she’d always assuage my fears. I never dated anyone else in the entirety of the rest of our marriage, the most I did was talk to someone overseas I had a crush on and get rejected despite him also having feelings for me (he said he wasn’t worthy of my love essentially — it’s a very dramatic scenario). He was the reason I initially asked to open up the relationship/try for a throuple. I wasn’t interested in trying with anyone else… Moving on, April 2022 rolls around and one of her friends (who was not poly at the time and had/has a fiancé) basically confessed to her. She was surprised by this, but ultimately accepted. He didn’t tell his fiancé right away, which immediately bothered me — he was worried she’d react poorly and do something drastic. So he like… eased her into it 1.5 weeks later? She still didn’t take it well if I’m remembering correctly. Had a lot of problems with ‘jealously’ which seemed bad to me. It felt like he forced her into a poly relationship she didn’t want to be in. I am also not taking it well, having basically ended things (other than platonic chatting and writing — we were post by post roleplay friends) with overseas guy. I told my ex-wife I was uncomfortable with how the guy that confessed to her was handling the situation with his fiancé (hiding it from her) and that I didn’t consent to this type of relationship — that I had wanted to be in a throuple. She said she didn’t recall being told that, that we had agreed on simply opening our relationship/becoming poly. I was gutted… I eventually let her pursue him after being talked down, but was obviously very upset, much like his fiancé. The guy involved kept setting up what I would call ‘playdates’ between my ex-wife and his fiancé, for them to spend more time together and bond, I guess. They were already friends before, so I found it extremely odd. One night I’m actually invited over to dinner, but it’s on a day my ex-wife had said was our date day and sort of forced me to go to dinner over there despite me just wanting to spend it with her. At one point the guy cornered me at the table and kept asking me what my problem was — why was I so upset? I was still sad about being rejected a few months back by overseas guy, so I briefly mentioned that and he clung to it. He essentially called me a hypocrite for my behavior and that I was being too clingy and jealous with my ex-wife. He kept interrogating me until I was in tears at the table. I had an internal mental breakdown in the car on the way home and essentially lost it when my ex-wife asked if I was ok the moment we got home. I told her I felt like she didn’t love me anymore, that all she cared about was this new guy and the lads and appeasing his fiancé so she wasn’t jealous or whatever. I said I feel like you’re going to leave me and I’ll be all alone. I got so upset I gave myself a stress-induced nosebleed and migraine. She was so shocked by my outburst she didn’t know what to say, I guess. I don’t remember her trying to comfort me that night… I just remember going to sleep in our bed together, trying not to bother her with my crying. The next few days happened so fast. It was already May 2022 by this point, and I still wasn’t feeling well. Confession guy and my ex-wife go on their first date and I self harm without thinking about it (I scratched my wrists until they bled, I was not intending to cause myself to bleed). This freaked me the fuck out, so I texted my wife essentially ‘hey, not doing so well mentally, I hurt myself a little — but it’s just a scratch — I’m going to have some bandages and stuff delivered.’ I didn’t mean to ruin their date, it genuinely didn’t occur to me; I thought she would want to know I wasn’t well. Then I read my texts after patching myself up that she felt like she had to leave the date early because of me and her guy was upset at me. I felt bad, so I texted guy trying to explain the situation and apologize, he never responded if I recall. She came home and checked my wounds and was generally apathetic. We didn’t talk much for the rest of the day. One night I ask again, hey can we go back to being monogamous? I am not handling being poly well. She snapped at me, saying she was finally happy and now I wanted to take that away from her. I remember staring at her and declaring we should go to couples therapy. She hesitantly agreed and I texted our therapist (yes we both saw the same therapist at the time, I’m now told that’s a faux pas) for an appointment. It was scheduled for Monday of the following week. We would not last to get to that appointment. The next few days she was very affectionate (which I thought was strange, but I didn’t want to look a gift horse in the mouth) and we went on lots of little adventures (local coffee shops, bookstores, etc). I finally felt like maybe things were going back to normal. We were winding down after one fun day and I asked if she wanted to do a question game like old times. Basically I would look up something like ‘50 questions to ask your significant other to get to know them better’ and we would take turns answering. Things started off light, but eventually we got to a question which I don’t remember the exact wording per say, but my answer was ‘I think you suffer less in life because you’re conventionally attractive, that it’s helped you get further in your personal life and career’ I thought it was quite mild, that I could have been harsher, but it’s how I felt. Her face crumpled and she started crying and I was immediately like oh god, I’m really sorry, please forgive me; is there anything I can do to make you feel better after hurting your feelings? She just cried… the game ended and we eventually went to bed. A few days later we have some other argument about being poly and I try to end it like hey, it’s late — we’re both upset and tired. Why don’t we come back to this with a clear head in the morning? She agreed and we went to bed. I wake up at 2:00 am to a nightmare the following morning; I turn to her for comfort and she’s gone. I call out, no answer. I get out of the bed and look around the house, afraid maybe she fell down the stairs or something. She is not home. I check my phone (we tracked each other for safety) and she is shown to be at the guy’s house. I deflate. I call her and it goes to voicemail. I text her, no response. I call her again and she answers. She sounds apathetic and dead inside. She asks me to leave her alone, that she’s tired and will talk to me tomorrow when she’s ready. I have a bad feeling, so I ask her, hey could we talk now? This is really upsetting and you just left without telling me in the middle of the night after a fight. I’m worried about you and us. She disconnected the call after that and I crumbled into tears. I attempted to get up and walk to the bathroom, but ended up tripping and hitting my head against the television console. I pass out. I wake up approximately four hours later to our tiny dog jumping on me and then licking my face. My head aches, I’m dizzy as well as nauseous. Fearing for my safety, I text her again telling her I had just come to after what I guessed was fainting due to head trauma. No response, but I’m desperate and scared, so I text the guy, asking him to wake up/tell my ex-wife what’s going on because I might need medical attention. He says if it’s so bad I should call an ambulance and that I shouldn’t expect her to pay for any of my medical bills anymore… he’s extremely hostile. I say I can’t afford an ambulance or medical assistance on my own. He says something like well you better find out fast then. I’m not stupid, by his reaction I pretty much know my ex-wife is done. I, in desperation and very, very upset, send her a barrage of messages like hey we love each other right — we’re going to couple’s therapy on Monday (it was Friday morning at this time), that we can make it work if we try. She ignores my texts. Guy tells me to stop texting. I stop and go back to the bed and cry. Eventually I call a suicide hotline because I see the writing on the wall and I don’t see how I can live without my ex-wife. She was my world. The worker was ultimately very unhelpful, bless her; she kept saying our relationship could still work out. That my ex-wife was just reacting emotionally and would see logic soon. Well, she didn’t. Or maybe she did? Depends on who you ask, I guess. Anyway, she doesn’t come home until around 3 pm or so that day. She waltzes in, overly peppy and sits me down. I had wrote her a letter on my phone for her to read basically laying down my feelings for her and why we should continue to fight for our relationship and marriage. She didn’t want to read it, but I insisted. She reluctantly read it and said it was sweet, but didn’t change how she felt. She tip-toed around what she wanted to say for the next few minutes, saying this wasn’t because she was ableist or with a new partner. That the guy had nothing to do with it. I eventually, very defeated, asked her if she wanted a divorce because she wasn’t fucking saying it — just everything but it. She said yes… and I asked if we could still be friends, for the pets’ sake at least, if not the fact we had been in a nearly decade-long relationship. She said maybe. She told me she wanted me out of the house in approximately a month or so. I agreed and made arrangements with my parents to come get me and my belongings. The following couple of weeks I was nothing but civil and kind to her. I bought her dinner multiple times with my credit card because she was stressed and tired from work. We even watched a movie together and laughed/hung out like old times. I was thinking it would be an amicable divorce, that everything would be ok. That we would still be friends because our bond was so strong. I was very wrong. She still went to hang out with the guy, who now officially hated my guts, and the lads. Every time she came home from hanging out with them, despite any good times we had prior to her leaving, she would come home looking at me with disdain. It got to the point she was gone until the wee hours of the morning and our tiny dog (he was attached to the hip to her) would yowl and whimper because he missed her since she’s been gone so much. I would text her something along the lines of I can’t sleep because dog woke me up/keeps crying. He misses you. She would largely ignore these texts. Sometimes she would apologize with a simple sorry. I spend the next couple of weeks loving on our animals because I don’t want to separate any of them and have them be lonely/miss their siblings. I cuddled them, gave them extra treats, and told them how much I love them and would miss them. I took more pictures of them during that time. This annoyed my ex-wife, stating she had previously promised to send weekly/monthly pet texts with pictures and videos. Moving on, I pack up and leave, loading my stuff in the back of my dad’s pickup truck. I, physically disabled, overexert myself helping and she never once offers to help. In fact she hides in the bedroom the entire time my parents are in the house. When I’m finally done loading up the truck… I go to say goodbye to her. She seems dead inside. I say goodbye and had her a handwritten letter. She says she probably won’t read it, but I say it was more for me than her. We hug, she pats my back and I give the pets some last kisses and pets. I tearfully look back at my old little family: her and the pets. Then I walk out of the house for the last time in my life. It was our first place after living in her parent’s basement. I found the listing on craigslist. We were so excited at the price point and location. I loved that house. The ride home to my home state and hometown was rough. I cried through most of it. My birthday was a couple of days later. My family celebrates it at a little restaurant, but mentally I am not there. My ex-wife texts me happy birthday with a few pictures of the pets and I’m extremely grateful to see them. I thank her and go about my day. By leaving the place I lived throughout my entire 20s, I also left my local friend groups, my social circle. I didn’t mention my friends very much in the retelling so far because I honestly hadn’t interacted with them that much that year. I was going through so much shit with my ex-wife that it didn’t occur to me to reach out because I didn’t want to ‘shit talk’ my ex-wife. Lots of people reach out to me when I leave my quirky little city. There’s a brief outpouring of love and empathy for my situation, possibly even pity, too. I was grateful for any time I wasn’t alone with my thoughts… but eventually the messages trickled to a drop then it ultimately ended. I was alone again, in my hometown with my parents I left roughly a decade ago because I fell for a girl in another state. At first I’m okay for the most part. My ex-wife texts me back when she feels up to it if I have questions/want to see the pets. I message a few of my friends back ‘home’ or what was home for 8ish years. I connect with a few of them on a near-daily basis, I’m invited to a friend group chat. I’m doing ok, I guess. I start to do things for me: work on my writing, re-dye my hair a fun color, practice makeup, spend time with my hobbies, etc. Everything feels fine… until it isn’t? The reality of my situation hits about a month and a half into living with my parents and I have a severe depression spiral. My parents aren’t equipped to handle me like this/I wasn’t usually this upset in public in the past… so they really aren’t much help. They honest to god try, but they aren’t medical professionals. My friends eventually pull me out of the spiral by spending time with me and letting me vent. Months go by, my ex-wife is dragging her feet on the divorce process. She gets offended when I ask about it, citing she has a full time job and a new relationship, that she doesn’t have time to do it then. I largely let it go and try to get all my medical issues checked out while I’m still on her insurance — she had good insurance. The only thing I don’t commit to is finding a therapist/psychiatrist because I didn’t want to get acquainted with someone and they suddenly didn’t take my new insurance… so I wait, eventually I found a job that I enjoyed, only for them to fire me because I was sick too often three months later. This devastated me, but I was able to find another job shortly after that — it was more physically draining and I barely was able to do it, which my managers quickly caught wind of. That job lasted approximately six months. I then got a job as a secretary — the workers said I was good at making appointments for them, but the managers said my sales were lacking. I desperately tried to sell the memberships associated with the business, but ultimately, two months in, my manager calls me on my day off and fires me. I haven’t worked since and my disability has just gotten worse. I rarely leave the house now, except for the brief periods of time I would feel the need to go on dating apps, connect with people, then ultimately be ghosted after one or three dates. I met a few new friends through old work acquaintances and the dating apps, but ultimately it was a waste of time. I feel like all I do is moan and complain and people avoid me, so I’ve largely just stuck to being funny and masking. People like when you’re funny; they want to be around you. They do not like when you’re raw and upset. Understandable. My ex-wife blocked me on all social media and phone about half a year or earlier now. Unprompted, didn’t say anything — I just went to ask for pet pictures one day and noticed the messages weren’t sending. At first I thought it was a glitch, some kind of error… but, no. She’s blocked me. In fact, since April 2023 she had been slowly weaning off interacting with me in any way. Weekly pet photos turned to monthly, which turned into nothing unless I asked for it specifically. Sorry for all this jibber-jabber, I basically give all this context to say that ever since my separation and ultimately my divorce, my life has been… aimless? I don’t have a family to work for or provide for in any way. My parents don’t like when I cook… so I can’t provide for them in that way, which is how I mainly provided for my ex-wife. The only real time I’m happy is when I take my yearly trip back to my old city and spend copious amount of time with friends in a real life setting. Not just online. I originally had a goal of moving back there, to be around friends again… but I don’t think I’ll ever get there. I had started to apply for disability because my illness had gotten worse (physical and mental). I’ve spoken to two attorneys so far and they both declined representing me, saying my paperwork/medical records are lacking. I’m so tired of everything. All my parents and I do is have brief moments of peace between bickering. I’ll say something I find completely neutral and not negative in any way and one of them or both of them will take offense. I’ve started taking weekly compounded semaglutide (think Ozempic) because of my weight/PCOS/insulin resistance and they complain about the cost of the medicine, despite the fact I’m on the cheapest plan available. My dad even joked the medicine was my Christmas. I’m very grateful for the medicine, but it makes me egregiously ill when it’s time to up my dosage every 2ish weeks. It’ll be extremely nauseous, dizzy and tired for at least two days, basically condemning me to be bed bound. My parents think I’m overreacting and want me to lose weight faster. They think if I lose weight I’ll be healthier and happier. I wasn’t always overweight, in fact, I was in shape and slim until my illness struck in my mid-twenties. My back got worse and I lost the ability to swim/walk regularly for exercise. Without that daily exercise, I largely became sedentary and overweight over time. I just… don’t see much of a point of living anymore. I’m too broken for normal jobs, burnt out of creative work most of the time, and not disabled enough for disability. I feel like I’m doomed by the narrative, to be frank. I’ll go through phases where I’m ok, not thinking about my ex-wife… only for something I see to catch on my memory of her in my mind, or someone to mention her in passing. Then either I’m a little sad or I spiral. I haven’t been able to determine what triggers a spiral as opposed to feeling just generally sad/nostalgic. But it gets to the point where I just… can’t stand myself or living. I don’t think I’m ready to seriously date again, and honestly I’m not sure if I’ll ever be able to again. I gave my ex-wife quite literally the entirety of my twenties… I don’t know if I can trust anyone like that again. I’m tired, I’m worn out, I’m fried, I’m all those things and more. Sometimes I wish I could fall asleep and just stay in a pleasant dream where I’m loved by someone and I love them back; like just sitting on a couch while my loved one knits or crochets or something while I write or draw. Just serene parallel time with someone I love. That’s gone now. I’m all alone now. There’s only darkness as my companion in the night. I turn to the other side of my bed in the morning and it’s empty. What’s even the point? Before the open relationship/poly debacle we were planning on having kids. We were choosing between IVF and adoption, leaning towards adoption. I’m so glad we didn’t have/adopt a kid. This situation is quite literally the worst thing I’ve ever experienced in my life. I don’t know if I’ll recover, and I’m trying to, by god I’m trying so fucking hard. But it’s not enough. It’s never enough. Now it’s New Year’s Eve and almost a new year, 2025. A whole year of being unemployed, sick and depressed. I have creative projects I’m working on, but like… what’s even the point anymore? I know if I died I would hurt others by my actions; that my funeral would be expensive and put a burden on my family and friends. But I’m so tired, my friends. I’m… so sad… and lonely. I want out of this deep, dark hole and I can barely see the light at the top. I’ll dig my fingers into the soil of the hole and attempt to crawl out, only to fall down on my back again in the mud.

Hello everybody, 
I am 32yo, male, not smoking, 85kg for 185cm, no preexisting conditions. Around seven years ago, I ordered pure caffein online (I was drinking a lot of energy drinks and wanted the caffein without all the sugar). My consumption was around 300mg to 400mg of caffein a day. I quickly realized that, around 15 min after caffein intake, I could smell a strange odor. I first thought it came from my own body, or maybe my flat or something... but no matter what I did, systematicaly, after high dose of caffein, I could smell that strange odor. It is kind of a burnt/leathery smell, and it ""tickle"" the nose a bit, like breathing in a dusty room. I stopped taking that caffein powder and went back to normal coffee. That smell came back anyway, it's consistently the same smell, and it slowly fades away in a few hours. 7 years later, it is still the same if i take enough caffein. I tried to do some reading and saw that caffein can increase the sense of smell but here, it is more like and olfactive ""hallucination"". Am i the only one ? Best",1,1735710463.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

The only other barefoot sandals I have tried on were Xeroes, and I think Xeroes are narrower. Xeroes are also much more expensive.

Between my multiple trips and countless posts on this thread, I cant seem to find a neighborhood that checks most of my boxes. Any help is appreciated :)

Looking for a 1-2 br, ideally with parking (open to any recs here), in a super walkable neighborhood. Hoping to stay under $3K/mo. but flexible for the right spot. Some things I'm looking for:

* Charm > new builds
* Relatively flat, highly walkable
* Variety of bars & restaurants
* Gyms / fitness classes
* Not consistently swarmed by tourism / quiet throughout the day (WFH 80%)
* Easy access to highways to get to the beach, hikes, etc.
* Strong community / easy ability to meet people and make friends

I'm 29M, single, and will be moving there solo. I dont know many people so I'd love to find a neighborhood with a strong community, and easy ways to meet people.

To be super thorough, what I love about Brooklyn is my ability to walk less than a block to find a coffee shop, bar, and restaurant and the charm of the old buildings / lack of high rises. I've stayed in the inner and outer sunset, and the mission. I loved how open outer sunset was but it lacked things to do. Inner sunset seemed great, but relatively quiet and family oriented. The mission checks probably most of the boxes, but I found the walkability limited to a few blocks (too many hills) and it didn't scream safety to me after 11pm (correct me if im wrong please!).

Four warheads, appropriately placed, ready to destroy months of work. I call it the Choltitz Protocol, after the German general who was supposed to destroy  Paris before the Allies got there (plot twist, he refused the order).

So I'm mucking around with the timers this morning, trying to set up for a 60 second countdown (if anyone knows a mod or script to put this on an LCD screen, I'd appreciate it). For testing, I was using lights; green for 30 seconds remaining, orange for 20, red for 10, purple for Boom.

Kiddo, who a browse through my previous posts has also helped me design my base's bedroom (as well as office and defence grid), had woken up and come it. So for 10 minutes, we sat and talked through what I was building, adjusting the timers, and quietly cheering when we got the sequence right. Then it was downstairs for breakfast.

It's fun building ships and all on SE, that's for sure. But one of the things I really enjoy is thy when I wrap us a session because Kiddo has woken up from a nap or sleep, we can spend a few minutes looking at what we've built and planning next steps.",1,1735710199.0,spaceengineers,0,0.67,False

1hqwlb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hqwlb9/espresso_guidance/,Espresso Guidance ,"I got the Breville Barista Touch Impress. 

My issue is I have never drunk espresso shots prior to having this machine but love lattes so I don't know what to compare it to. Every time I try a sip of the plain espresso it's awful. It's either sour or bitter and I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like this because it's a straight shot but from what I am reading elsewhere it's not supposed to taste like this. I'm going to go to Starbucks and try a doppio to compare. 

Other issues:

The machine isn't correctly dispespensing 18g of coffee and 36 grams of espresso for a double shot. It has the sensor where it says a bit more or trim but then I weigh the portafilter and it's like 16g. 

No matter what setting I have the grinder (the grinder is from the machine) it has been hard to get the 25-30 second brew. It's always either 23 seconds or 31+. 

Every time seems to be different for the settings on this so yesterday I have started weighing out 18g coffee put it in the grinder and manual brew for 27 seconds but then realized it should be a 1:2 ratio with it yielding the 36g. 

Aside from the other issues, the lattes I've been making have been tasting ok but not exactly how I like it which is why I suspect something must be very wrong because from everything I'm seeing the fresh coffee should be better not worse. 

Overall, I want to learn more about making the right shots for lattes and I like the touch impress because it's compact, all in one, and pretty easy to use but I also don't mind measuring stuff out and dialing in on the shot to make it right. 

I think one of my biggest issues aside from actually brewing is not have ever trying a straight double shot of espresso so I don't have anything to compare it to besides my own brews. ",1,1735709759.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Medjo detailed pero magulo sorry:(

~~Flight TPE - MNL via pal.~~

~~Early Morning Arrival
Leave big Luggage sa condo/get quick sleep rest. Slept whole day talaga. Nag pa grab lang ng brunch. Medjo pagod pa sa long flight.~~

MNL - CGK via Ceb Pacific.  
Stayed for 1 night in Jakarta. 

Was supposed to take the risk of getting the flight to Ambon @ 1AM , but decided to cancel since different terminal(?)and only 2 hours for layover.

Met with some old collegues that are based in jakarta for lunch/coffee. Dito ko narin na semi complete yung itinerary details ko.  With their help , opinion and recomendation. Pina joiners ako ng kasama ko sa kapatid nya na indonesia naka based sa Raja Ampat, kaya naka cheap ako sa gastos dun. 

CGK - AMBON 1AM flight. Via batik air(?) more than 3hour flight.

Early morning arrival in Ambon then wait for next flight.

Short layover - then 9am flight to langur

Ambonn- Langur  - around 1 hour flight. via Lion Air din ata.

lungur/Kai Island/Ngurbloat beach. Stayed for  5 days. Wished I spent more time. Pero cguro tamang tama lang. chill lang ako dito. Walang masyadong ginawa. May island hopping o beach chill. Rest lang kumbaga majority ng time. Nag diving din ako. Wala akong specific itinerary talaga. 

9/10. Comparable to islands in the Philippines with tropical beaches. Parang larger(?) version ng boracay during the 90s(?) 
Beach is ++. 

Langur - Ambon 1 hr flight Via Lion Air(RT tickets)

Stayed in ambon for 1 and half day. Since I want to explore din dub and mas cheaper ang next next day flight. Almost x2.5 ang price. Could use that money for Acc and tour sa Ambon island. Which I did , worth it naman. Could have stayed another day to explore more. I was tempted to take indirect route yung Ambon - Makasar - Sorong na mas cheaper kaso sayang ng oras. Pero baka mapagastos pa. Worth naman yung short stay ko sa ambon. Medjo bitin pa nga.


Ambon - Sorong. Flight

Rajah Ampat Islands.

Spent  4 days sa Rajah Ampat area. Island hopping , dive , swim and trying different island accomodations. I was here before kaya medjo na identify ko na yung magandang puntahan. Kaya shorter period lang ako dito.  And test narin yung prices if mas mura ang medjo like for like activities like in Palawan/coron/elnido. The short answer is parehas lang. parehas lang. depende talaga, yung tours and dives parang di mag kakalayo ng rate sa pinas. Pati equipment rental. 
Moneywise/gastos wise I can say its not cheaper than in palawan/elnido/coron.
Mahal pa nga mga homestays nila dun. 


My initial plan was getting a RT from MNL-CGK-MNL.

Kaso medjo mahal ang CGK-MNL. Mas cheaper yung Bali/Denpasar - MNL.

Sorong - denpasar bali via plane din.

Stayed for 3 days in bali supposedly. Kaso nakita ko cheap yung RT tickets Bali - Jogja. Dahil may game yung football ng philippines.

Flight from Denpasar to Jogja, then  Jogja to Surakarta via KAI.

And I watched that historic win vs Indonesia, while in an Indonesian crowd. Wearing my red indonesian football jersey hahaha. Buti di ako nakuyog/ jk. O na Identify as filipino. Hahha...

Sa surakarta narin ako natulog. Dito cheapest accodomation sa pang 4 star service na sa PH. parang provincial kumbaga.  Dito mo talaga masasabi na mas cheaper ang accomodation vs PH.

Balik ng jogja to Bali.

Actually I was trying to find flights from Jogja to Singapore/HK then Iloilo. Yung Jogja SG,HK okay naman ang price. Kaso ang mahal na/wala ng tickets from SG/HK to Iloilo.
Kasi If may cheaper yung SG/HK - Iloilo 
Would stay sa jogja for another day nalang. Pero wala too expensive. 

Balik sa original ticket.

Bali - MNL nalang. 

Overall medjo rough estimate lang.

Pati timings and flight/travel time.

Flights tickets/transport - spent around 67K+?
Medjo mast minute kasi yung iba. Pero yung pinaka last minute na Bali - Jogja - Bali around 6K lang.
Yung medjo mahal is yung papunta sa kei islands.  Mixed use eto , ceb pac , lion air , batik. Could have get a much cheaper tickets pero yung timings/time yung hinabol ko dito.

Accomodation 40K pero around 30k lang yan dapat kaso I tried yung sa Rajah ampat last day yung semi luxury na around 10k+ per night na accomodation. Average ko 2k per night twin  room pero solo lang ako ;)  also kaya to maging 15-20K if dun ka more budget friendly na accomodation. Lets say palawan/coron/el nido din ang rates nila dun.

misc / tour / food na extra / scooter rental / dive / equipment/ rental - 30K 
yung sa tours ata yung mahal meron 5K per head na tour , pero worth it naman.  Equipment rental same same din sa pinas. Dun ka sa medjo mahal and legit syempre haha.

10K others . mga tips and other expense like souvenirs(?) parang wala naman ako binili., ticket ata ng Football game major chunk neto.
Like minor expense nga parking fee. Parang petty cash. 

Most hotel my free breakfast/brunch. Kaya most of the time dinner lang gastos ko for food. Pero mag snack din it between.

Siguro around 150K+ for 15-16 days.

limited lang ginawa ko na tourist activities. Slow travel lang.

Could have spent less pero last minute booking and mabilisan lang ang hotel choices
Hindi to splurge out trip kumbaga. Like 2 lang yung mahal ang accomdation which is 1 in Rajah ampat. Pinakacheap is yung surukarta na prang last minutel deals, sa parang 4 star hotel.

This trip is one for the books kumabaga. Eventhough its my 2nd time Rajah ampat area.

Also na dedelay din mga flights niIa, almost missed 1 flight kahit na malaki ang gap hours yung layover. Na delay ng 4 hours haha. Buti nalang still  naka abot din. 

Sorry medjo magulo pag kaka sulat ko. Ang hirap mag edit pala ng long post sa reddit app. Daming wrong words. Medjo lost track din ng times and days dun. Hahah.",1,1735709709.0,phtravel,1,1.0,False
1hqwkjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeavenlyDelusion/comments/1hqwkjo/my_understanding_of_the_show/,My understanding of the show.,"Please feel free to drop hints i might have missed. My head is all mixed up but i have a few things to point out to myself so i thought i should share it with you. This isn’t going to be in order.


1-Robin did rape haruki but in a scene it depicts that he was originally in a sexual relationship with his sister before he transferred into her body. As he was telling her in a flashback “… while Haruki is asleep” while looking down on him sleeping(his sister’s memory). Plus he brought her coffee which is apparently a gourmet in this world, which means he was happy and wants to celebrate this occasion with (her) as he obviously won’t bring coffee to that room to drink it all by himself.That doesn’t debate that he is a rapist and fucked up in his mind that he slept with a young boy in his sister’s body.



2- Maru is one of the twins that Tokia had.
Apparently one of them had special powers or special blood or smth special for them wanting to differentiate between them and giving one back to Tokio and the other ( the special one) to keep for them for some reason. 



3- man-eaters: they are the reincarnation of the children in this special facility for when they die of illness they turn into monsters. The children were created by (Mina) artificial intelligence. Which brings me to the other mindblowing point since the fall of the earth as they know it happened just 15 years before the story’s time, and the children who turned into monsters are apparently the cause as they won’t die by bullets or weapons so there is no stopping them except with maru, so woman who was with doctor Usami must be one of those children whom he fell in love and lived with. There is something that is bugging me though, the kid that died in the facility at the beginning with the disease didn’t turn into a man-eater but he had what appears to be the beginning of the transformation left behind when he was cremated. This could be explained that they don’t turn to man-eaters the moment they die like zombies, but they take a while, like a month or so.


4- all the children were made with the purpose to be very healthy and immune to all diseases so that the wealthy ( as the americans who came by in one episode) could transplant their brains in their healthy young bodies as they turned 15 and live a longer life. A step to immortality. Asure was one of the first prototypes of the children, that’s why they described her death as their mistake as they thought she was imperfect and killed herself because she had thoughts in her head that her body couldn’t handle.


5- as for Juishi and his kid. One of the following has to be true since the kid had man-eaters powers. Either juishi was one of those children who escaped or the woman he impregnated was. Which is the most probable since a man eater appeared at the same place a month after she was killed and hanged at that place. Enough time for the monster to form inside.


I am still missing a few information.
Why did the robot (Mina) break out the children? Did it want to help or did it want to destroy humanity and found this a plausible way?
How can the children dream of the future or predict it?How come some of them have super human powers? Kano??? Everytime he drew a picture it came true- the baby- the fish monster- what is Asura’s goal?

im a plus size guy who got little to no experiences on sexual activities. di naman ako panget hahaha i can confidently say naman na i got looks, its just that i dont know how to sell my self hahahah and siguro due to ppl’s preferences (and thats very okay).

anw, i just had this wildest and riskiest experience (atleast for me) last month lang hahahah 

so on alter twt, i dont post a lot there pero meron naman akong nakakausap, and this one guy dmed me on a random saturday morning hahah

taga rizal siya and ako naman near the area. he asked if we could meet sa mall just to chitchat lang daw. ako naman, i have nothing to do that day so pumayag naman ako. 

atp, i wasnt even expecting anything na may mangyari hahah kasi it was just an invite to meet and he’s running an errand din that day and we had very limited time.

so ayun, he can only wait up until 2pm and nakaalis na ako sa bahay around past 1 pm na hahaha tho malapit lang naman ako, na traffic parin. was able to have him wait naman so that was a relief on my end hahaha

so weve met. naglakad lakad muna kami around the mall while talking tas inaya ko mag coffee hahah kaso twas a mess. sobrang low signal ako so i couldnt buy him a coffee (nag offer pa ako hahaha). edi syempre i was apologetic. kaya ayon, we ended up talking nalang ulit then walk around the mall.

so after a while, he suddenly asked me, “san tayo?” hahaha nagulat pa ako at walang ibang maisip na lugar. he asked me pa if we can do it sa parking (may dala akong transpo pero di tsikot hahah) 

then he asked me to follow him. edi ako naman sumunod hahaha alam na this lol

dinala niya ko sa cr ng cinema. male cr sana kami kaso it was closed. so dun naman sana sa all gender cr kaso sarado din hahaha so akala ko lilipat kami but this guy hopped in sa male cr without hesitation hahahha

ive got no choice but to follow and boom, we did it inside the cubicle hahaha twas just a bj tho

it was a fun and risky exp ive ever had so far. hahaha na enjoy ko rin naman.

And i hate it because i never know why it comes back, it just always comes back and it’s a punch in the face every single time because i will be going on 2-3 weeks of feeling decent and then all of a sudden i have a shitty day and i can’t even think beyond the feeling of nausea which comes with the legitimate and intense fear of throwing up (ever since i had food poisoning i fear throwing up ridiculously) and it sends me down this anxiety spiral which as you know just makes everything worse and i don’t know how to get out

I’m on lexapro , doesn’t help 
I’ve taken Pepcid , didn’t help

Yet the nausea comes back, and it seems like my body is just toying with me 

On top of that doctors don’t know shit , they just prescribe whatever pill they can and send you on your way, I’m so tired of them telling me it could be stress cause motherfucker I’m only stressed cause this shit started happening not the other way around.

Anyway, I just finished watching it and after a quick search I've yet to come across the only ""explanation"" for the movie that comes to my head... Abortion. Well, gender reversed abortion, that is. There's, at least I believe, a key comment when they're bickering about buying the coffee table by Jesus; ""I wasn't ready to have a baby."" He states that it was her idea. So it would then make sense that the proceeding beheading is akin to the medical procedure of abortion, and of course the symbolic ""blood on his hands"" as he's hand is also injured in the process. Going in mostly blind to the film, I was surprised about how sudden his decision to slam the baby on the table (off screen) happened since he was practically ""baby talking"" him (is that the correct term?). I suppose that could also be a commentary on how some women are so quick to decide on undergoing that  procedure even at late term?

Some have complained about how my debrid cache comparisons have relied on Torrentio's flawed reporting of Real-Debrid's cache. The thinking is that Real-Debrid has much more cache than the RD+ links that currently appear in Torrentio suggest, and that it has not, in fact, been overtaken by Premiumize or others.

It was finally time to put this to the test.

I tested over 500 links across 12 pieces of media (a mix of movies, series, and anime from 2014 and 2024) to see if they are REALLY cached or not by Real-Debrid. The automated tests involved using Real-Debrid's API to attempt to add the links to Real-Debrid and seeing if they then required Real-Debrid to download them (in which case the download was cancelled and they were identified as uncached) or if they were available instantly (in which case they were identified as cached).

Here is the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NO3UF0qEX3nANRZ8n2PZzKES3LtApBYsb1FTcwFscfQ/edit?usp=sharing) with the numbers of cached vs uncached according to Torrentio vs (the more reliable) Real-Debrid API.

**Key Findings**

* Real-Debrid's API showed 348 cached links vs Torrentio's 274
* 27% higher cache availability than Torrentio suggests
* 102 links (20% of sample) were cached but unreported by Torrentio
* 28 cases of false positives (primarily complex multi-file torrents)

This was actually less of a gap than I'd expected. The crowdsourcing-based approach to identifying cached links hasn't been too bad.  Nevertheless, If we apply a 27% correction factor to the most recent numbers I reported for Real-Debrid, this would, in fact, put it at #1 for cache ahead of Premiumize.

And these would still be under-estimates of Real-Debrid's cache as this did not include data from other addons like MediaFusion. Also, the (28) cases where Torrentio reported a link as cached and the Real-Debrid API determined the link as uncached were mostly cases of torrents with many files and so it was harder to decipher and make a definitive conclusion.

Real-Debrid may still be the cache king. However, given that it's based in France and is thus more vulnerable to having its services shut down, I can't recommend signing up for Real-Debrid for more than 1 month at a time.

I did a bunch of research here and this is what I ended up with. Tried not to spend too much but end up with something decent. It took a good evening to learn how to use it, mainly getting the grind right, but it tastes better than most shops now!

Breville Bambino $300 : Pro may be worth it to you if it’s on sale, I don’t see it being worth $200 extra however. I’m happy with the normal version.

Turin SD40S Single Dose Grinder $180 : Build quality feels great, no plastic. I wanted the DF54 but it was sold out, so I saved some money and don’t feel like I’m missing out too much. 

So $480 all in, cheaper if you can catch the Bambino on sale, I couldn’t. I already had the kitchen scale, no timer so I just use my phones. the cups are Mora Ceramics 8oz from Amazon, my preferred size for a double shot to milk ratio. also a WDT tool for like 6 bucks, don’t think it was necessary honestly, I can’t taste a difference.

1hqvvap,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1hqvvap/hes_everything_i_wanted_but_in_this_ldr_i_dont/,"He’s everything I wanted, but in this LDR, I don’t feel wanted. ","

I’ve been seeing this guy for a while now (5yrs). He’s everything you could ask for great values, ambitious, caring, and hardworking. A complete green flag. He’s always looked out for me emotionally and even financially when I needed help. He’s been a great son, brother, and partner. I know I 'should' be happy, but I’m not.  

Since we’ve been in a long distance relationship, something’s shifted. He feels so distant not flirty, not needy, just far away. When we were staying together, he couldn't even sleep if I didn't hold him, he used to wakeup in the middle of the nights, when I would be studying and come lift me up and take me to bed, basically he wanted me. 

Now, He’s there when I call him if I’m struggling, but he never calls me for anything. Once, I decided not to call him for 19 days, just to see if he’d notice. On the 20th day, I caved and called him myself. He thought I was just “busy.”  

I’ve told him how I feel, and he says, “You know I can’t be without you.” But his actions feel different. He’s never really celebrated my birthday or our anniversary. I’ve always made those special for him, even hosting events. I know it's because of financial constraints, and I understand that. But last year, he even forgot our anniversary.  

At the same time, he’s been generous in other ways. When I needed a study table and chair, and a friend refused to return the money I lent them, he instantly ordered it for me on his credit card, saying he’d manage until I got my money back. Also when I used to complain how I'm sexually frustrated, he didn't hesitate for a second and ordered multiple sex toys, he's never been insecure about himself and I love that about him. Also, in every aspect of my life, he’s never hesitated to help me when it truly mattered.  

But last night, on New Year’s, I waited for him to call. I didn’t want to be the one to call first again. But at 2 a.m., I gave in and called him myself. He was busy, as usual.  

When we weren’t in LDR, things were different. He needed me. He cried in my arms, shared his worries, and let me in. Now, unless I specifically ask, he doesn’t share anything. I know he’s busy, but this emotional distance is breaking my heart.  

Am I overthinking? Should I just let it be until the LDR is over and see how things are when we’re together again? I want to start this year fresh, without constantly worrying if my partner actually needs me.  

If you’ve been in a similar situation, how did you handle it?

1hqvsht,https://www.reddit.com/r/tollywood/comments/1hqvsht/my_2024_tfi_best_movie_list/,My 2024 TFI best movie list,"Below are my personal rankings. I realize I might have missed to watch a few other good movies like the recent Zebra, let me know if there are any other lesser-known good movies.

# Very Good:

* **Aarambham** 
   * This movie deserves more recognition! A very inventive sci-fi movie with an engaging screenplay and rooted in telugu nativity. Many times better than KA to be honest.
* **Kalki 2898-AD** 
   * Had my issues with the characterization of Prabhas and the emotional connect, but overall, a stellar attempt to mix mythology and sci-fi and one of the best TFI movies in the past decade. Nagi's vision takes the cake.
* **Saripodhaa Sanivaaram**
   * *Oka manchi coffee lanti mass movie*. Perfection in story and screenplay, Vivek Athreya nails it!
* **Lucky Baskhar**
   * Very clever writing, at the same time making the audience root for the main character so much. I don't remember the last time the audience cheered so loudly because the hero gets a... job promotion? 
* **Pekamedalu**
   * Our own ""Great Indian Kitchen"" but this was so much more uncomfortable to watch. Highly recommended and it might just give you a new perspective. 

# Good:

* **Gaami**
   * Neat plot with actual world-class visuals. Hope we get to see more big-scale movies from the director. 
* **35 - Chinna Katha Kaadu**
   * It was just a little too cinematic for my taste but loved it overall. And Nivetha gives the best female performance of the year. 
* **Swag**
   * I only wish they didn't mess up the screenplay so much with so many elements and subplots some of which don't land. But a great effort and the flashback portions are really good. 
* **Tillu Square**
   * Nothing much to complain. A novel comedy franchise.

#  Above Average:

* **Committee Kurrollu** (I think this movie only works best if you can relate to the location or the characters which it didn't for me)
* **Ambajipeta Marriage Band** (good attempt that gets saved only due to Saranya Pradeep's character. Suhas needs to find some variation in his roles.) 
* **Mechanic Rocky** (a very interesting second half)
* **KA** (I know majority opinion is very favorable but it felt like a very B-grade movie overall and only works because of the twist)
* **Mathu Vadalara 2** (mess of a screenplay that only works because of Satya's role, it's not sustainable and they need better plots to continue this franchise)
* **Hanuman** (needed better writing and villain character, looks like they focused more on the religious aspect)
* **Pushpa 2 - The Rule** (overall I found it entertaining, though they dragged it too much in the climax. And Fahad was wasted)

I watched most of these movies in theater, and this is my humble request to all TFI fans, if you want the industry to survive long term and if you want good movies to come out please go watch all kinds of movies in theaters. Not just the big mass commercial movies. A Pushpa or Baahubali will only come once every 3-4 years and that is not sufficient to sustain the entire industry. We need consistent good BO results for even the small and medium scale movies. 

I don't really think ticket price is really a big issue as people make it seem because the same people are spending a lot to watch their star movies multiple times. Maybe I'm talking from privilege but that's my opinion. 

  
P.S If you are Jr NTR fan wondering why Devara is missing, sorry I think that movie is only made to cater to fans. It has absolutely nothing for normal audience to enjoy. They messed up the story and narration so badly that I'm not even interested for Part 2. Will watch Chuttamalle video song on repeat as that's the only good thing to come out of it.

You also need a smoosher from etsy, it was $23 plus shipping, so about $30.  

So all in, im at $60 for 500 cups, so $40 less for the first 500 and then $70 less there after.

1hqvph3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpooktacularTales/comments/1hqvph3/tim_woke_up/,Tim Woke Up.,"Like always, it was a process.  There was no singular moment Tim could point to as being fully asleep, with the next fully awake.  He blinked in and out of consciousness, fighting to stay in the dreamworld, and ignore his responsibilities a little longer.  What ultimately did him in was a mix of Larissa loudly blasting the TV in the living room of their two-bedroom apartment, and his own bodily needs.  He wanted to be upset, but what could one accomplish from lying in bed all day?  Now, if she turned down the TV once he came out of his room, he’d know she loved him.  As he stumbled across his room, he noticed that his favorite shirt was laying across his barely used desk chair.  It was a nice, breezy, long-sleeved white shirt, perfect for striking a business casual look.  While it may, under some circumstances, end up on top of a chair instead of in a laundry hamper, on an ironing board, or nicely hung in his closet, he should have remembered carelessly tossing it there like some sort of lazy college student.  And… was that a stain!?  Some sort of goopy mud had been dripped across the front of it.  How could that have happened?  Let alone in the middle of the night while he was sleeping?  His mind raced while he went to the bathroom.  A welcome distraction from the base needs of the human body.

Could he have sleepwalked?  Gotten dressed, gone outside, rolled around or something, headed back inside, took off his shirt, showered to hide the evidence, and then gotten back in bed?  Nonsense.  Could Larissa have decided to sneak into his room, put on his favorite shirt, then eaten ice-cream or something while wearing it, and then just tossed it back in his room instead of trying to clean it?  Maybe.  But doubtful.  It was bizarre.  Then he noticed his toothpaste.  Cinnamon flavored?  He never got cinnamon flavored.  It was mint through and through.  Cinnamon toothpaste always felt like he was brushing his teeth with cookies.  Could he have bought it at the store without noticing?  And then proceed to brush his teeth with it for weeks without noticing?  Was he still dreaming?  Tim pinched himself.  He wasn’t convinced.  He had felt pain in dreams before.  Although it was more muted than that.  He’d have to confront Larissa.  He hoped it was just her, he didn’t even want to think about the alternative.  Some lunatic breaking into their apartment and messing things up, or worse hiding out in the closet or under the bed all day and only coming out at night when they were asleep.  He shivered involuntarily.  

He walked out in the living room and his attention was immediately captured by Larissa.  She was beautiful in way he couldn’t quite express with words.  It wasn’t just her confidence or grace, when she bothered to use it.  Or just the way she spoke with a measured eloquence that impressed him without making him feel uncouth.  It was the time they had spent together, their inside jokes that always got a chuckle out of him, and how she could almost guess what he was thinking.  It was probably one of the reasons they had always gotten along so well.  When they’d first met, they would talk for hours, sometimes long into the night.  Tim could look into those bright eyes and feel safe.  Willing to open himself up.  It just made sense to start living together after college.  It was hard *not* to imagine being together.  And now they were… Tim’s left hand clenched, it felt different…

When Larissa noticed Tim enter the room, she turned down the TV.  Tim immediately spoke, preempting any “good morning” niceties, “Have you seen my shirt?”

Larissa stared at him; the silence stretched.  “The one you’re wearing?”  She asked.

“No, my favorite shirt,” Tim gestured behind him.  Towards the chair, and the stained catastrophe draped across it. “When I woke up this morning, I noticed it was on my chair and had a weird stain on it.”

“You have a favorite shirt?” she said with a sarcastic lilt.  

“Well, I mean, who doesn’t?”  this had not gone as he expected, “I-I think I prob-, may-uh, hasn’t this come up before?”  Didn’t everyone have a favorite shirt or three?

“No.”  She said confusedly. 

“Well, I suppose it’s a shirt that I, uh, think looks good on me?”  Tim awkwardly asked with a complete lack of confidence.

“So, is it that blue paisley one?”  she began flipping through channels.

“No, the white one, you know it’s long sleeved, has nice buttons…” Maybe it would’ve been better if he had just brought the shirt with him.

“Ahh… the white one…”.  Larissa seemed to only be half-paying attention.

“What?”  

“White’s… not really your color.”  Tim had never felt more offended.  His entire sense of fashion had just been upended.  

“But I-i think it looks good on me…” Tim trailed off awkwardly and Larissa shrugged, “Anyways it’s my favorite shirt.”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

“Gahhh,” Tim threw his hands up with exasperation, and stalked back into the bedroom.  He snatched up the shirt, causing the desk chair to spin around and crash into the desk.  He felt immediate regret and winced at the sound.  Regardless, he was on a mission.  So, he stood tall and marched back into the room.   “This shirt.”  He said purposefully.

“That’s your favorite shirt?”  Tim had finally gotten her attention.  

“Yes.”  

“It has a big stain on it.”  Larissa deadpanned.  

“Yes, exactly, that wasn’t there last night!”  Tim shouted exasperatedly.

“And, you think it looks good on you?”  Tim couldn’t believe she needed to rub that in. 

“I just want to know how the stain got there.”  Tim sighed, hands dropping to his side.

“I don’t know.”  Tim supposed he shouldn’t have been surprised at this point.

Nevertheless, against his better judgment, Tim was compelled to ask, “Well, who else is there?”  

“Really?”  Tim withered under her glare, “You’re accusing me of sneaking around and staining your clothes?”  Larissa was clearly annoyed that their first conversation this morning consisted of pointed questioning.

“Well, no.  Of course not…” She turned the TV back up, the sound covering for Tim’s awkward pauses. “But then how did it get stained?”  Tim shifted awkwardly, having lost his purpose for the morning.  

He could practically hear her rolling her eyes, “I don’t know, you spilled something on yourself probably.”

“It’s just weird…” he threw the shirt back into his room, “and then there’s the toothpaste.”  He spewed out as an afterthought.  

“Toothpaste?”  Larissa asked, eyes glued back to the TV.

“It’s cinnamon flavored.”  He sighed.  The drive to obtain justice for his shirt had completely left Tim.

“Yes.  That’s existed for quite a while.”

“No.”  Tim walked over and sat down in the living room’s guest chair, “It was in the bathroom.  How did it get there?  Neither of us use it.”

“You bought it buy accident?”  Tim hung his head in his hands.  He still had no idea what was going on, but at least they thought alike.  

“But it was used!  I’d remember using it.”  Tim wished she could feel as confused about this as him.  

“I don’t know.  I used it.  Or whatever.  Who knows?”  Tim could tell she didn’t really care.  Instead, her attention was squarely on the TV.

“Do you remember using it?”  Tim tried to eke a small nick in the wall of her disinterest. 

Tim was rewarded with a noncommittal grunt.  He gave up.  Why should he be worried anyways?  It wasn’t healthy.  The idea of someone sneaking into his apartment to leave or use cinnamon toothpaste was ridiculous.  Thinking about cinnamon reminded him of David from work.  He’d always made a big deal about hating mint whenever they were planning office parties.  He swore by cinnamon toothpaste.  Tim thought David was an odd guy.  Some people find oddness endearing.  

Tim glanced over at the TV.  For some reason Larissa had insisted that the guest chair face away from the TV.  His jaw dropped.  “What are you watching!?”

“Loony Toons,” she said shrugging towards the TV.

It was Tim’s turn to have his attention glued to the TV, “What n-no…” Larissa looked off to Tim, “it’s n-not supposed to be spelled like that!?”  Tim didn’t shout this much usually, but there had been too many deviations this morning.  Besides it was hard to hear anything over the drone emanating from the box.

“Oh, did they need your approval,” Larissa’s eyes rolled, “to name it?”

“No, it’s… just that I remember it.” The bright screen consumed his vision, “I remember it being spelled differently.”  

“Oh boy.  I’m not sure I’m ready for your early onset dementia.”  Larissa laughed from somewhere outside Tim’s view.

“No, this is serious.”  Tim *knew* it wasn’t spelled that way.  Just like he had *known* his shirt hadn’t been dirty the night before, or that his toothpaste wasn’t cinnamon flavored.  Why was this happening?

“It’s serious that you don’t remember the name of a fifty-year-old cartoon?”  Larissa offered yet another rational explanation.  There was nothing for Tim to worry about.

Tim was no longer worried.  “It’s just a lot of weird things.”  He turned from the TV and got up, “Weird things all happening at the same time…  I’m going to go get some coffee.”  That was the next logical step in the day.  

Tim walked into the kitchen.  Thankfully Larissa had already made coffee, and there was some sitting in the pot.  But he could have sworn that the coffee maker was usually next to the fridge, instead of next to the kitchen entryway.  That made it easier to add creamer.  Did she move it?  He opened the fridge and his chest tightened.  He could feel the weight of panic pulling down on him.  Inside the fridge was another mystery.  Another misplaced, misremembered object.  Prince’s Peanut Butter.  What brand even was that?  He’d never heard of it, let alone bought it.  Worse, it was flavored: honey pistachio.  What sort of deviant would buy pistachio flavored peanut butter?  He snatched it out of the fridge, and hurried back to Larissa.  The unattended fridge door banged into the kitchen wall, breaking the silence.  “Did you see this?”

“Peanut butter?!”  Larissa said with mocked shock.  Tim could picture her sarcastic expression, eyes wide with hands on either side of her face.

“It’s honey pistachio flavored.”  Tim almost felt dumb saying it out loud.

“Weird,” Larissa was still lackadaisical, but slightly more engaged than before, “why would anyone make that, and why did you buy it?”  Tim was happy to have her support again. 

“I didn’t.”  Tim said with a confidence he lacked, “I mean I don’t remember buying it, but there it is in the fridge.  And this is something I would remember buying.”

“I gotta agree that’s memorable.”  Tim could almost hear her smile.

“So?”  Tim begged the question.

“So?”  

“How did it get there?”  Tim realized he was still staring at the peculiar, green, peanut butter. 

“I don’t know, the previous tenants?”  And, she was disinterested again.  Still Larissa had given Tim another perfectly rational explanation.  

“But, we’ve been here for…” he looked at Larissa.  Through her.  Trying to remember her.  Their time together.  Their years together.

She stared at him silently.  Completely still.  A moment captured in time.  Tim glanced at the dates on the jar.  “It looks like it was bought recently anyways,” he mumbled.  

But how long had he been here?  He went to the mantel.  As useless as a fireplace was where they lived, a mantel was still *the* place to display their fondest memories and pictures.  This time his heart didn’t even drop.  Tim was expecting it.  A photo he didn’t remember.  He softly mumbled something that Larissa wouldn’t have been able to hear.  It was a picture of Tim at a winery.  If it was on the mantel, Larissa must be in the picture somewhere as well, but he couldn’t tell.  His eyes just glazed across it; unable to focus.  He turned back to couch.  “I don’t remember this.”  He knew that they went on a trip for an anniversary.  It must have been the anniversary of them…  They had talked about going on a wine tour of Napa Valley, or glamping in Oregon. They ended up in Oregon.  While on the trip one of his favorite pictures of them together had been taken.  He didn’t see it anywhere, but he could just barely remember that moment.  It was the only time he asked a stranger to take a picture, forcing him to stand there smiling with Larissa while silently praying his camera wasn’t stolen.  Why wasn’t it there?  What was hap-

“You know its Tax Day tomorrow, right?  Larissa’s voice cut through his confusion.  His concerns fell away, replaced by another, stronger fear.  After a moment’s thought, relief washed over him.

“It’s fine, I did the taxes early this year remember?  There right here on my computer,” he went back into his room and on his desk was a computer he didn’t recognize.  Frantic searching revealed that Tim had not done his taxes.  He let out a heavy sigh.  His entire day was ruined now, but he was filled with a new purpose.  

Tim went back out into the living room to ask if they should be filing jointly.  The couch was empty.  Why had he come out here?  Just to procrastinate from the awfulness that was preparing his taxes.  Tim felt something on his cheeks; wet, salty tracks.  Why?  On the edges of Tim’s recollection was the fond memory of a dream.  But it was just a silly dream; Tim couldn’t know why it’d make him cry.  He’d have to tell David all about it.  Who else did he have to talk to?  However, first came his taxes.  Tim began his work in an empty, one-bedroom apartment.  

A part of Tim still felt like it was safely bundled-up in that dream.  Rejecting the present world.  But Tim has no say in the matter.  He had to wake up.",1,1735706139.0,SpooktacularTales,0,1.0,False

The lot at the Five Dollar store across from Oldhand used to be free and was one of the more convenient places to park downtown.

I parked there to take my mom out for coffee a couple weeks ago and my dumb ass didn’t see the signs that have recently gone up stating that you can’t park there for more than 45 minutes. We came back after 55 minutes and found a ticket for a $98 fine. At Christmas. Ow.

(Please don’t tell me not to pay it… I know it’s a private company but unfortunately I have to use Impark lots every day at my work, so they’d probably fuck me up pretty fast if I refused to pay.)",2,1735705228.0,abbotsford,2,0.63,False

So I just got into the espresso world and bought the Delonghi ECP 3420 espresso machine and a Fellow Opus grinder. I use fresh coffee beans and bottomless portafilter to go with it. I tried many shots to find the best grinding setting which can give me a good shot with perfect crema in around 20-27 seconds for 15 grams of bean and 30 grams of water. But still the taste is bitter and the buck is soaking wet after I remove the portafilter. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong here so can you guys tell me how to extract a sweet shot?

I have a family history of high blood pressure, and it did not miss me. I've had high blood pressure even going back to when I was in high school, with a very healthy diet and in very good shape (exercising daily for school sports).

With my father's recent stroke, I've decided to try and get my blood pressure under control sooner rather than later. I've been without a PCP for years, and have just recently made an appointment for a physical, but it's months out.

In the meantime, I've been trying things on my own. Lowering my sodium intake, being active more often (Something I struggled with due to having an office job), eliminating energy drinks and soda from my diet. I've lost about 25lbs in 3 months, but haven't noticed a real measured reduction in my blood pressure. I went to the walk-in clinic today because of an asthma flare up, and my blood pressure there read 165/139, 96bpm heart rate. (They measured it three times and ended up in the same ball park). This is without any coffee.

Obviously there's a ways to go, and blood pressure medication is in my future, but is there any singular thing I could be doing better right now to lower my blood pressure? Google has so far just given me general guidelines that I feel like I'm already doing.",3,1735704992.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False
