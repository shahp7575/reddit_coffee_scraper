I‚Äôm on day 5 of no caffeine. I previously used to drink four shots of espresso at 5:00 am, two shots at 8:30 am and then an afternoon pick me up at 1:00 pm. 
Stopping caffeine seemed to allow both the Cymbalta and the Wellbutrin to work effectively and successfully on my anxiety and depression. 

Every day I‚Äôve abstained from coffee I feel like I have a safety net beneath me, caused by the Wellbutrin. It has allowed me to be more affectionate, patient and kind. 

I‚Äôm wondering if this is simply a placebo or have others experienced this as well: great results now that coffee is out of the daily equation.

When I get it checked without fasting necessarily it comes back in a normal range. For example, I had something small for breakfast like an egg and black coffee and then went to the doctor maybe an hour or two later.

Great seeing this place has been useful for so many of you since I started it. 

Along these lines, after seeing countless posts (here and many other threads!) I decided I'd trial something. 

The idea is basically, we match you with a small group of people (max 6) in your area for a coffee -- but the matching is based on your indicated personality type, conversation style and preferences. The idea being this will help ensure you get to meet a mix of people and there's likely to be natural chemistry (i.e. no awkward silences üòÖ)

A friend has helped me to soft launch it already, and we've already got 5 pilot events set up for Christchurch alone üò≤ these are free while we test and learn, get feedback, etc. 

Well be refining the process and experience based on feedback from these pilot events, before going wider.

But in the meantime, we thought we'd put it out there - if you'd like to try something like this in your region, we'd like to know. 

We're gathering expressions of Interest across NZ, to see how much demand is actually out there. If there's enough interest in your region, we will launch there too ‚ú®Ô∏è

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **""Falcons vs. Cowboys: A Preseason Snore-Fest Where Even the Birds Are Asking, 'Why Are We Here?'""**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‚Äòround for the most thrilling event in sports: the Atlanta Falcons vs. Dallas Cowboys preseason finale! If ‚Äúthrilling‚Äù is code for ‚Äúa nap with ambient crowd noise,‚Äù then consider this your official invitation to witness NFL players who‚Äôd rather be anywhere else‚Äîprobably a hammock, or a coffee shop, or a time machine that skips directly to the regular season.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Statistical Masterpiece (or a Spreadsheet Error?)

Let‚Äôs start with the numbers, because even in preseason, the bookmakers are here to remind us that *someone* is profiting from this chaos. The Cowboys are listed as 2.5-point favorites, with decimal odds hovering around 1.65-1.68. Using our trusty formula for decimal odds (`1 / decimal_odds * 100%`), this implies Dallas has a \~58-60% implied chance to win. Meanwhile, the Falcons hover around 2.2-2.3 odds, translating to \~43-45%‚Äînot great, but not exactly a math whiz‚Äôs worst nightmare.

The total points line? A paltry **35.5**, down from 36.5, as if the universe is subtly mocking fans who still think preseason games are about football. For context, the Falcons have averaged 15 points per preseason game, and the Cowboys a slightly less anemic 17. Add ‚Äôem up, and you get‚Ä¶ 32. Exactly the kind of score that makes the ‚ÄúUnder‚Äù bet look like a genius decision.

### Digesting the News: Where Are My Stars?!

Both teams have treated this game like a casting call for *The Backup QB Chronicles*. Atlanta‚Äôs Michael Penix Jr. and Kirk Cousins? Sitting this one out, presumably sipping kombucha and judging their teammates‚Äô footcare. Instead, we get Easton Stick, who‚Äôs thrown two touchdowns all season‚Äî*if* you count ‚Äútd‚Äù as ‚Äúturning down a promotion to starter.‚Äù

Dallas? They‚Äôre giving Joe Milton, a QB whose career highlights include ‚Äúnot Dak Prescott,‚Äù a shot to ‚Äúfind out more about \[him\],‚Äù per coach Brian Schottenhe

You will rarely see a woman with someone who earns less than her, but gay men happily marry/ be in relationships without thinking about these things.

Gay men would also be very dependable and you can count on them on doing some actual work. It feels rather upsetting you can't have that in a straight marriage.

Acc to straight marriage bs traditions, you as a man are the provider. You must earn money till you die, must care for offspring, must take all the risks. Your worth is determined by how much money you are bringing for having the privilege of staying with that woman. Quite unsettling.

Need advice and don‚Äôt know where to turn. Here is the story with all truth and facts. Bought new lg range and had delivered December 2024. When we bought this we saw general lg reviews talking about front knobs turning on by leaning on them etc. we never in a million years thought this would be an issue with current products they were selling.

Move forward to August 2025. I go about my normal morning routine. I do not use the range in the morning. Make my coffee, pack lunch and off to work 8am. Husband calls at 9am to say our furbo went off and he hears smoke alarm. He doesn‚Äôt see anything. I rush home (5minutes away). Get home and smell/see smoke when I walk in. Look to hate and right hand front burner is on full heat, with smouldering item on stove top. I turn off burner of course, and extinguish fire. The only possible conclusion is that I brushed against the knob when pouring my coffee. Unfortunately item was on our stove top, there is damage to microwave and our cabinets, and strong smoke smell in all of cabinets and upper part of house. Of course the most distressing part is that I had my dog and cat home and I cannot even fathom what would have happened to them if not for the furbo. Without it, I do believe something truly horrific could have occurred.
I called Lg and they are sending someone out. Husband looks up on google to see recall from 2025 for this exact same reason. We did not know. I asked lg how were we to know and she didn‚Äôt answer me. Showed me about the control lock feature on front of range. Yes I saw that button but thought it was for oven cleaning or if there were toddlers around maybe? We are grown adults with grown kids. 
I am sick to my stomach over this incident and fear it will happen to someone else with much more severe consequences, looks like already 38 fires from this‚Ä¶ we are 39. Also there is a class action because they continued to sell ranges with known issue. I am so upset about this!

Hello Reddit! It‚Äôs been a while! And I have a lot to update you on regarding this story. First of all, I will be revealing real names now (but only first names) because everyone needs to be warned about the girl you all know as ‚ÄúPurple‚Äù. A few months into the school year, Maya, aka ‚ÄúOuchie‚Äù, and I stopped being friends. Mayo (which is his real nickname) and I are also no longer friends. After the Violet, aka ‚ÄúPurple‚Äù, incident, I realized it‚Äôs better to cut off people who treat you like shit rather than keep them in your life until they ruin you, so I cut them both off. I got a boyfriend, who is now my fianc√©, and we live together about an hour away from all Violet drama, but I still get updates and you all need some too. 

At the beginning of the school year, I was really worried about going back to school with Violet. As you all have read, she did not quit her antics, even majority of the way through the school year. My friend, she one she tried to push down the stairs, is named Jay. Jay and I began working together and Violet would casually show up, parking her car across from or next to Jay‚Äôs and even staring at them while smoking weed (as a 17-18 year old) in the parking lot. Her stalking never let up. 

Eventually, my then-boyfriend-now-fianc√© and I met, and because he lived an hour away, I could talk about him, and I would. I‚Äôd be talking about him with one of my friends in the bathroom, which Violet, of course, was in. Talking about the morning and goodnight paragraphs, him buying presents for my family and buying me flowers and treats every time he came to visit, etc. 

Violet had a boyfriend for a while, but, when I found mine, hers had just broken up with her because she was ‚Äúexactly like everyone said‚Äù. So, of course, me having such an amazing person in my life pissed her off all over again. Her antics got worse, but I was learning to deal with them. That is, until, she saw Jay and I at our local Walmart and followed me to my house (10 minutes out of the way to her house) and tried to ram us off the road during a massive blizzard. 

Of course, we reported this to our SRO but, of course, he did nothing. 

It got worse and worse but I was able to manage it. However, just at the start of Christmas break, I decided to stay with my mother after she told me some concerning things about my father and I believed her. I continued to live with her until April, just after my 18th birthday, when the shit had truly hit the fan. My mother had always been abusive, even getting arrested twice for domestic abuse against my father, but it was mostly in the safety of our own home when no one was over. Now, we had 2-5 extra people living with us (depending on what day it was) and no matter what I did to help her, she still was the same she had always been, only now it was in front of people. 

I went to stay with my boyfriend one weekend and told him what was going on and that I didn‚Äôt want to go home. He generously offered me a place to live, with him. I went back to her house once to get my stuff and she pinned me down and yanked my phone out of my hands while I was actively on the phone with a 911 operator, worried about my safety. An officer, who had already been waiting outside for my call, came in, I got my stuff, and I left crying harder than I had ever cried in my life knowing I couldn‚Äôt live with little siblings or see my dogs grave ever again. I thought the Violet drama was over. 
Keyword ‚Äúthought‚Äù. 


I lived with my boyfriend, I did all my schooling online. It was hard and there were A LOT of complications but I even graduated from the same school. I saw Violet there but I didn‚Äôt contact her and I think I only looked at her once. Finally, this period of my life was over. That was, until today. 

After months of silence on the Violet front, I got a text from a friend, Grey, who had worked with her at a nursing home in my hometown. I know, the irony of her stalking and threatening me and then working at a nursing home where her whole job is to take care of people is not lost on me. 

Anyways, today I got a text that has so much tea, I could start my own tea shop, if not for the fact that I‚Äôm about to spill it all. 

Grey and I were casually catching up when he mentioned that Violet was fired. I asked what had happened and all the overthinking and dreaming in the world couldn‚Äôt have prepared me for this. 

Background (cause I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve said it before): Violet is adopted. Her adoptive family is incredible and has truly had a hand in raising me. They are incredibly loving and supportive people and the ultimate picture perfect family for adoption. The family any foster kid would want. Her mom is a paramedic who bakes for events in her spare time. They live in a huge house and have a beautiful family with 2 dogs, 2 cats, and 7 kids. Violet once called me telling me they were abusing her and when I asked what happened, she said they had yelled at her because her room was a disaster. That‚Äôs the worst it ever was in her household. It was actually really upsetting to hear someone use the word ‚Äúabuse‚Äù in a situation like that when I had grown up in a house where I was thrown into walls, pinned down or against various items, made to sleep naked on the kitchen floor and outside as a pre-teen, and even told to kill myself by my own mother, and that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg on my side. 

Anyways, Grey revealed to me today that Violet was fired for 2 reasons. The first being lying about her homelife. Apparently, Violet had said that she was homeless and her mom was ‚Äúa crackwhore‚Äù. This, in and of itself, is already upsetting given how much I still love that family despite all Violets done to my friends and I. However, the most upsetting news of all, Violet apparently had an issue with a 90 year old resident at the nursing home and decided to deliberately pour scorching hot coffee on her, causing 3rd degree burns. The woman died less than a week later. The worst part? They can‚Äôt charge Violet with anything, at least pertaining to murder. While the cameras caught the coffee incident, they have no proof that Violet had anything to do with the woman‚Äôs death. No one knows if the family knows about what Violets done but all of us know that that family will never find closure. 

I found this all out today, just mere hours ago. I truly don‚Äôt know what to do. Her mom is on vacation in London, and while I have her contact information, this is a lot to dump on someone while they‚Äôre on vacation. Then there‚Äôs the question of whether or not she‚Äôll even believe me. The police can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt do anything and the family may not even know that their loved one was a victim of such malicious behavior. 

So, people of Reddit, for a third time, what do I do? ",1,1755833545.0,u_Puzzleheaded-Owl4550,0,1.0,False

Fear that she‚Äôll return and try to finish what she started. Or maybe‚Äîwho knows‚ÄîI‚Äôm just schizophrenic, and all of this is nothing more than one long, bad hallucination.

Nonetheless, I‚Äôm here to vent to you all. I need you right now, especially since I feel her creeping closer with each waking day. She lingers in the shadows, waiting for me to make the wrong move. She waits in blissful silence, knowing that somehow, someday, I‚Äôll be back for more. I can‚Äôt let that happen. Guide me. Be here for me.

It all started back in May. I‚Äôm an out-of-state college student in my sophomore year, and as you can imagine, I‚Äôm already under a lot of stress. To blow off steam, I always went to a nature trail near my university. I‚Äôd spend hours roaming through the woods, wanting to feel like nothing‚Äîyou heard that right, nothing. I wanted to feel like a void, exempt from the pressures and stresses of life.

During those times, I would occasionally call out to the universe for clarity. I felt like my life wasn‚Äôt my own, that my existence was just a preprogrammed path of emptiness with no true fulfillment. Maybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm 22, but I‚Äôm sure many of you reading this can relate one way or another.

Two months ago, on an afternoon beneath a lavender sky, I was hiking through the woods with my dog Milo, an all-black German shepherd. He kept me company through the long strides in the woods. He also acted as an alarm system for potential threats, that‚Äôs when I noticed Milo detecting something. I followed him as he veered off the trail and soon came across a trail of fresh red blood smeared across the leaves and branches.

I thought to myself, Who would just randomly go off trail like this? My first assumption was that a predator had been carrying its prey‚Äôs carcass through the woods. But then I saw it,a blood-drenched footprint in front of me, nestled between two large rocks. I crept forward slowly, ready for whatever predator I was about to encounter, although the predator must have left its prey as I saw  a freshly killed white-tailed deer carcass.

The strangest part about this was that the deer was almost fully intact. There were no signs of a struggle, no gashes. I assumed at first that maybe it had died of natural causes. But upon closer inspection, I noticed two small tooth marks near its neck. A snake? What snake would cause so much bloodshed around the area? The blood spread across the leaves and branches all around but yet no gashes?

I was perplexed. Something felt off. Maybe it really was a snake bite‚Äîperhaps the deer vomited while dying from the venom, and maybe someone else had stumbled upon the scene before me, leaving that footprint in the blood. Whatever the reason, I decided to move on. I returned to the trail and started heading back toward the car lot.

That‚Äôs when the thirst set in. The summer sun had drained me, and I realized I hadn‚Äôt stayed hydrated. I spent the remainder of the hike trying to forget about that weird situation.

When I finally stopped by a water fountain, the cold water after hours of hiking and ignoring my dehydration felt like pure rejuvenation.

As I lingered there, taking my time, I noticed a pale-skinned girl with light, curly brown hair standing behind me, patiently waiting her turn. Immediately, I apologized for holding her up.

‚ÄúOh‚ÄîI‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt see you there behind me!‚Äù I said, stepping aside and gesturing for her to go ahead.

‚ÄúOh no, no, you‚Äôre okay!‚Äù she replied sweetly. I waited behind her, planning to take another drink once she was finished.

When she turned back toward me, her pale skin seemed to glow beneath the lavender sky, and her light curls framed her face as she gave me a long, genuine smile‚Äîa smile that could awaken even the most dormant, tired soul. I instinctively smiled back, as best I could, and then she went on her way.

I‚Äôm not the type to dwell on moments like this. Some of my college friends are girl-crazy‚Äîheck, what 22-year-old college student isn‚Äôt? But this was different. This was genuine. Time seemed to pause, and for once, I felt alive. Corny to many of you all but it was true, let a man live.

As I drove back to my apartment that day, I was perplexed and confused. Why? Why did this hit me like a freight train? I tried to convince myself that I didn‚Äôt feel anything, that I‚Äôd be okay the next day.

As you‚Äôve probably already guessed, the next day came and my curiosity only grew. Who was this mysterious woman? For an entire month, I kept going back to that trail, hoping to see her again. Every day I returned, hoping that another glance would stop my thoughts from spinning out of control. I just wanted to feel focused again, like I controlled the wheel in life.

But each day, she wasn‚Äôt there I just grew more hopeless, more crazy. Was that single encounter really enough to set me off like this? It didn‚Äôt make sense. I must have been obsessed. I kept telling myself people have reasons for falling in love, but mine didn‚Äôt feel valid enough. Not for someone I‚Äôd barely met.

And then, there was the strangest part of it all.I started dreaming about her. I almost never dream, or at least I rarely remember them. But after that night, the memory of our meeting kept replaying while I slept. I‚Äôd wake up feeling drained, hopeless, like I was slipping through the safety net we call ""ego"". The stress must‚Äôve been affecting me physically too as I started to get a rash on my back and neck. I assumed I was scratching at it in my sleep. All of these events transpired during that month when I kept going back to the trail, trying to find her, the mysterious woman as I'd like to call her.

After feeling like I was drowning inside of my own head I decided to mentally ground myself, I sat down at my kitchen table and stared at Milo my sweet boy, the companion who did not care about anything else other than pleasing me. That‚Äôs when I made a decision. I was going to go back to the trail one last time. Not to find her, but to let go. I needed to move forward and focus on school and my mental health.

As I packed up my truck for a 12-mile hike, Milo suddenly took off, barking and chasing a passing car. He‚Äôd never done that before. Maybe there was a dog in the car window or something‚Äîbut still, it wasn‚Äôt like him. I shouted and chased after him until he finally came back and jumped into the bed of the truck.

We drove off toward the trail. This time, I was mentally prepared. I told myself this would be the last time, my chance to break free of whatever strange grip this woman had on me. As we drove through the Colorado highways, I rolled down the windows and let the breeze wash over me. There was a calmness in that moment, like temporary freedom.

When the trail-head came into view, I slowed my breathing and tried to center myself. I got out, strapped on my hiking backpack, leashed Milo, and we began our walk into the woods. We played fetch along the way, Milo‚Äôs trained to be off-leash (I know some of you reading are already upset and commenting on how I should keep him on a leash), but we had a great time. Honestly, when I say we don‚Äôt deserve dogs, I mean it. Milo has always been there for me, he was an instrumental factor in keeping me mentally stable through those times, oh my sweet Milo, you'll be missed. 

Nonetheless I felt like myself again for a moment.I started to believe I could move forward and let this whole silly and embarrassing obsession go. Before my thoughts could linger I noticed something on Milo's neck that I also had on my own. He had a rash‚Äîon his upper back and neck, just like mine. Instantly, the hairs on my arms stood up. A cold wave rushed through my body, despite the hot August air. Could there be fleas? Mites? Something in the apartment?

I pulled out my phone and made a note to schedule a doctor‚Äôs appointment,for both of us.

We kept walking. Maybe a little too long. Fatigue started to set in, so we found a spot by the river and rested as the sun began to dip below the horizon. I had almost completely forgotten about her. I even laughed a little to myself, thinking how ridiculous it was to have been so caught up over a stranger.

But just as that peaceful feeling began to settle in, Milo started to growl a deep, low, disturbed growl. 

I turned around quickly, my heart immediately racing. And there she was.

The woman.

She stood there, bathed in the last golden light of the day. She smiled, then waved for me to come over.

I walked over and smiled nervously.
‚ÄúMy name is June. It‚Äôs kinda crazy how we ran into each other again.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know... I saw you sitting there and thought I‚Äôd say hello. It gets lonely out here sometimes. I‚Äôm Angeline,‚Äù she said with a soft laugh.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been coming to this trail for a while. Haven‚Äôt seen you much, except for the last time by the water fountain. Are you from around here?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, no. I live nearly two hours away. I work at my family‚Äôs flower shop. I just come out here now and then to breathe.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not in college?‚Äù  I asked as she seemed to be in the same age group as myself.

‚ÄúRight, I‚Äôm not. Luckily, our family business is doing really well. And... studying? Reading? Presenting in front of twenty-plus people?‚Äù She chuckled and squinted with a smile. ‚ÄúI count all my lucky stars that my parents let me work with them.‚Äù Then she reached for her phone in her back pocket.

""lucky...staying up till three in the morning has been one of the best experiences I've had as a twenty two year old"" I said sarcastically, now reaching for my phone as-well.

‚ÄúOh I bet, let me guess the Ramen noodles are fantastic too?"" she smiled slowly, and genuinely. ""Why don‚Äôt you take my number down? There‚Äôs a festival coming into town soon. I thought maybe we could go together, you caught my eye the very first time I saw you and I regretted not talking to you then, luckily we crossed paths again?‚Äù she said shyly.

""I think we both didn't seize the moment but it's okay, we have this moment now and I would love to go to that festival with you, Angeline.""

I eagerly pulled out my phone and saved her number.

She gave a warm smile and turned to leave, waving gently. As I walked back to my car, I felt lighter. The anxiety, the confusion‚Äîit all lifted. I wasn‚Äôt crazy. She remembered me. The feelings had to be mutual.

Then, just as I started to head back to the trail-head, I heard someone yelling for help.

I ran toward the voice and found an old man, trembling beside something that stopped me cold in my tracks. A dozen deer carcasses lay scattered around him‚Äîeach with two identical bite marks on their necks. Just like the one I had seen a month ago.

I knelt beside him, trying to keep calm.

‚ÄúThis must‚Äôve been some kind of freak accident,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the man gasped. ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt an accident. It did this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I asked, my voice rising with fear.

His eyes were wide with dread. Slowly, he reached toward my neck, his eyes rising with shock and dread, right where my rash was.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already sipping away at your body. Run, son. Go far from this town. It has chosen you,‚Äù he whispered.

I froze. A chill crept over my entire body.

‚ÄúOld man, stay with me. Don‚Äôt talk like that. This has to be some kind of accident!‚Äù I shouted, trying to shake the fear away.

But his breathing slowed. He started to fade. Just then, paramedics and county police arrived, rushing into the clearing. I stayed as long as I could, giving them my statement, explaining what I‚Äôd seen.

But none of it made sense.

Twelve deer.
Same bite marks.
Same location.
Same eerie pattern.

I thought about texting Angeline‚Äîto tell her what happened‚Äîbut stopped myself. It would make me sound insane.

What haunted me the most wasn‚Äôt just the deer or the bizarre coincidence.

It was the old man‚Äôs final words.

‚ÄúIt has chosen you.‚Äù

The next morning, I checked the news for any unusual reports from the trailhead, but to no avail. Nothing had been reported. I know some of what I‚Äôve shared with you all so far might sound like strange coincidences‚Äîbut how does something like that not make headlines? Twelve deer carcasses, each with two small puncture marks on their necks. No mutilation. No struggle. It was as if the blood had been drained clean from their bodies.

That‚Äôs when my inner conscience started to turn on itself. Was I losing my mind? Was my ability to process information objectively starting to fail? I grabbed a notebook and wrote down two objectives:

See a doctor and veterinarian for mine and Milo‚Äôs rash.

See a psychiatrist.

Later that day, I went to both. The doctor couldn‚Äôt diagnose anything on the spot. Same with the vet. They both took samples to be tested and told me they‚Äôd call in a few days. At least I got something out of the psychiatrist visit.

‚ÄúJune, I understand that everything you‚Äôve told me may seem crazy, but it can all be explained,‚Äù she said calmly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not speaking in any unusual fashion. All signs point to a normal, functioning, healthy brain. I think the lack of sleep and the pressure from your classes are causing you to mentally crash and become paranoid. Consider taking a break from school if you need to. Your mental health comes first.‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, with all due respect, after everything I‚Äôve told you, you still think I‚Äôm processing the world normally? That I‚Äôm not losing my mind?‚Äù I could feel the frustration and desperation rising in me. I didn‚Äôt want to be brushed off‚ÄîI needed answers. But as if she had read my thoughts, she continued.

‚ÄúJune, I know you want answers to the chaos in your life right now, but I‚Äôm the professional here. And I‚Äôm telling you, with years of experience, that what you need is rest. Time away from school. Time to breathe. You‚Äôre pushing yourself too hard, and there‚Äôs no balance. I tell my son the same thing as well since he‚Äôs your age. You kids sometimes push yourselves too hard. If things don‚Äôt improve, come back and we‚Äôll take the next steps. But for now, take a break.‚Äù

I left the appointment feeling more defeated than ever. There were only two possibilities: either everything I‚Äôd seen and experienced was real‚Ä¶ or I was genuinely going crazy, and they just missed the diagnosis. When I got home, all I wanted to do was crawl into bed. But something was off the second I stepped through the door.

Milo didn‚Äôt come to greet me.

He always greeted me.

I walked slowly through the apartment, flipping on lights as I walked through. I called his name. Nothing. As I got to the living room, a sinking feeling hit my stomach. The back door was open‚Äîjust slightly. And from beyond it, I could hear faint whimpering.

I stepped outside and froze. There, just outside the door, was Milo. He was lying still, breathing shallowly, his body pale and cold. The rash on his neck had grown worse‚Äîand there they were. The same two puncture marks, just like the deer had on its neck. My knees gave out as I dropped beside him, sobbing and screaming uncontrollably. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I couldn‚Äôt think. My best friend‚Äîmy companion‚Äîwas gone.

What had he tried to stop from coming into the house?

I buried him that night in the small patch of earth behind the building. I could hardly see through my tears. Anger and confusion warred inside me. Again and again, I asked myself: what did Milo try to protect me from?

I stayed up for hours researching. I looked into every animal I could think of that attacked the necks of its prey. The closest I found were large predatory snakes‚Äîbut nothing matched what I was seeing. Could this be a new disease? A virus? Something spreading through the area? Was I next?

All I knew was that once I got out of class the next morning, I was heading straight to the county hospital to report everything.

Researching the possible cause of this nightmare distracted me from my grief, at least temporarily. But the moment I stopped, the pain came flooding back. My body shook with tears, and I screamed into the silence of the apartment. I couldn‚Äôt imagine a future without Milo. He had loved me unconditionally‚Äîand I had loved him the same. I cried myself to sleep, praying that when I woke up, this would all have been a nightmare. That he would be there in the morning, wagging his tail, ready to greet me.

But I didn‚Äôt even make it to morning.

I woke up in the middle of the night, my rash burning worse than ever. I stumbled toward the bathroom, scratching at my neck. But something caught my eye. A figure, standing at the far end of the hallway. I don‚Äôt wear my contacts to bed, so I assumed my eyes were just playing tricks on me.

Then came the footsteps.

Heavy, fast, pounding against the tile floor.

The figure bolted‚Äîstraight for the back door‚Äîand slammed it shut with a deafening bang.

I darted into the bathroom and locked the door, heart racing. I grabbed my phone with shaking hands and called 911. My eyes scanned the drawers, searching for anything I could use as a weapon.

Something had been in my house.

And I was beginning to believe Milo had died trying to protect me from it.

After the police arrived, they spent at least an hour searching for evidence that someone had been in my apartment‚Äîbut found nothing. Not a single footprint. Not a scratch on the wall. Nothing.

‚ÄúSon, don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôve been dabbling in that acid and mushrooms crap?‚Äù one of the officers asked, giving me a disappointed look.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already had to call four ambulances this week to deal with kids tripping out,‚Äù his partner added with a chuckle. ‚ÄúMarijuana‚Äôs never enough for your generation, huh?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt even bother to argue. I just thanked them for their time and let them go. I knew they thought I was wasting it‚Äîand maybe I was. But deep down, I also knew I wasn‚Äôt crazy. I knew what I saw. I knew what I felt. The fear for my life was real. Something was out there. And it was coming for me.

The next day, I somehow powered through school with only a few hours of sleep and a heart full of grief. That afternoon, I received a call from the lab regarding my rash.

‚ÄúMr. June, we‚Äôve got your results. The rash on your upper back and neck appears to be infected with some kind of venom. Honestly, we‚Äôve never seen anything like it before. Have you been out in nature recently? We‚Äôd like you to come in for a more detailed follow-up test.‚Äù

That call solidified everything. Something was after me. I couldn‚Äôt explain what or why, but the venom confirmed it‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt imagining this. I was in danger.

I rushed back to my apartment and packed enough essentials to stay in a hotel for a few days. I needed time to breathe, time to think without watching my back every second. At the hotel, I tried to piece everything together. I wanted to call Angeline‚Äîto tell her everything, to have someone believe me‚Äîbut I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it. What if she thought I was insane?

I couldn‚Äôt risk that.

All I could do now was try to clear this mess up before our date next week at the festival. I had to be ready. I had to be alive. So I came up with a plan:

1. Tape or drill down all windows in my apartment.
2. Secure every door with heavy furniture and rig alarm bells to them.
3. Get a weapon.

For the next couple of days, everything felt normal. I felt safe. I went back to my apartment and settled in again. At this point, Angeline and I were scheduled to go on our date the next day, so that evening, I took a stroll to unwind from the chaos of the past few days. As I walked past a coffee shop, a woman stopped me abruptly.

""How long?"" she asked, her expression deeply disturbed.

‚ÄúExcuse me, ma‚Äôam‚Äîhow long of what?‚Äù I asked, confused and thrown off by her sudden question.

She leaned closer, pointing toward my neck. ‚ÄúHow long has that creature been sipping away at your soul? I can see it written all over you. It‚Äôs been eating at you slowly,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling as though even saying the words caused her pain.

I hesitated, then spoke, barely believing I was admitting it out loud. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been very confused for a while now, ma‚Äôam. I don‚Äôt know who you are, and I don‚Äôt even care if you think I‚Äôm crazy‚Ä¶ but something has been after me. I just don‚Äôt know exactly what it is yet.‚Äù

Her eyes widened. ‚ÄúI hate seeing young men like you go so soon.‚Äù She lowered her head, shaking it in disappointment.

‚ÄúWait‚Äîhold on! You have to help me figure this out. What do I do?‚Äù I begged, stepping toward her.

She looked up sharply. ‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt know yet? You haven‚Äôt been informed?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll I know is that everything started the day I found a deer carcass in the woods... one that had only two puncture marks on its neck.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow, son, after that occurrence‚Äîwhat else happened?‚Äù She squinted, eyes narrowing as if trying to see through me.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I ran into this girl‚Äî‚Äù I began.

She cut me off immediately. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard enough. I‚Äôm sorry, but I have nothing more for you. Whatever lies ahead is something you‚Äôll have to face on your own. I just can‚Äôt believe you haven‚Äôt been informed yet.‚Äù Without another word, she turned and walked away.

‚ÄúNo! Don‚Äôt just leave like that‚Äîyou were the one who started talking to me!‚Äù I called out, chasing after her. But within seconds, I lost her in the crowd.

What haven‚Äôt I been informed about? I asked myself over and over. The only thing I could take away from that conversation was that Angeline had something to do with all of this.

That night, I went to bed determined. I was going to tell her everything I had experienced‚Äîevery terrifying detail. At this point, I didn‚Äôt care if I sounded insane. I just wanted the truth more than anything.

That night, I had a dream. Milo was there, waiting for me in a green, lush forest. The sunlight pierced through the trees as he leapt into my arms, licking me uncontrollably. It felt so real, so full of peace. But then, Milo started guiding me down a trail into the woods. The deeper we walked, the darker it became. Grim shadows overtook the sunlight, and from within the trees, I heard the screams of men and women.

‚ÄúTurn back,‚Äù they cried.
‚ÄúKill yourself before you become one of them,‚Äù another voice pleaded.

Suddenly, an altar appeared ahead. Angeline stood at the center, wearing a tattered white wedding dress. Her smile was lifeless, empty‚Äîbut somehow, I wanted her more than ever. I craved her dark embrace. I ran toward her.

Just before I could reach her, I woke up.

It was morning. I staggered to the bathroom to brush my teeth, still trying to process the dream. But when I looked in the mirror, my stomach dropped. The rash on my neck had spread‚Äîand I looked visibly paler.

Worst of all, I saw them.

The two small bite marks.

The same ones I saw on that deer carcass two months ago.

They were faint but clearly visible. They were emerging.

I got my clothes on and walked out the door. I walked into the street and began asking everyone passing by if they could notice how pale I looked. They all said I looked normal‚Äîexcept for the rash, which, they said, could use some aloe vera. I asked if they could see the bite marks on my neck, and every one of them said no. The only visible, concrete evidence others could see was the rash.

After confirming that I might‚Äôve been hallucinating my physical state, I opened my phone and searched Google for any flower shop within a two-hour radius of my town‚Äîsince Angeline had claimed she lived that far out, though she never provided specifics. After digging through a few sites, I found something that froze my blood. There had been a flower shop about an hour and forty-five minutes away‚Ä¶ but it had been abandoned for the past twenty years.

Here‚Äôs the best summary I can give you of the article I read online:

‚ÄúThe Yeager family‚Äôs flower shop has been permanently closed due to a tragic family incident involving the death of Angeline Yeager, daughter of Julius and Martha Yeager, former owners of the local business. According to insider sources, Angeline died at age 19 in a head-on collision while out drinking with friends. It is unclear whether she was under the influence while operating the vehicle. Following the incident, the Yeager family shut down their business indefinitely.‚Äù

Below the article was a photograph‚ÄîAngeline. Picture perfect. The same face. The exact same face I‚Äôd been talking to. Who the fuck was I talking to if the real Angeline had been dead for two decades?

I even asked a few friends to confirm if the website and article were real‚Äîthey were. She hadn‚Äôt aged a day. Not a wrinkle. And come on, if she had died in a car accident, I‚Äôm sure some kind of trauma would‚Äôve been visible. What was I touching? Who‚Ä¶ or what took her place in death? And what the hell had they buried in that car?

I didn‚Äôt have time to wait for answers. I got in my car and headed straight for the festival where we‚Äôd planned our date. As I arrived, I felt a heavy, hollow fear rumble in my stomach‚Äîlike I‚Äôd lost touch with all five senses. And there she was, standing in front of my car with that same enthusiastic smile. A smile wrapped in lies... and sin.

I was ready to confront her. I had to.

‚ÄúHey Angeline,‚Äù I said nervously, trying to contain my fear, ‚ÄúIs there anything in particular you want to check out here? You‚Äôre more of a local than I am since I'm from Texas.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! Let‚Äôs go check out the rigged fair games,‚Äù she said, laughing aloud.

We walked deeper into the festival, hand in hand. As crazy as this sounds‚ÄîI still enjoyed being near her. As scared as I was, a part of me wanted to savor every second. But she could tell something was off.

‚ÄúJune,‚Äù she asked, frowning, ‚ÄúAre you okay? You look like you haven‚Äôt slept in days. Don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôve been up partying with your college friends.‚Äù

Her voice was soft but growing with disappointment.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that at all. Things have just been... weird. The past couple of months‚ÄîI‚Äôve been seeing some strange things. I feel like I might need medical help.‚Äù Regret and embarrassment flooded my conscience.

‚ÄúYou seem pretty normal to me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre crazy. So why don‚Äôt you tell me exactly what you‚Äôve seen?‚Äù Her tone shifted‚Äîcalm and sweet, but somehow... demanding.

I stepped back slightly. ‚ÄúAngeline, why don‚Äôt you tell me what‚Äôs going on? I think you know all too well. Let‚Äôs stop playing games and be open about the bullshit that‚Äôs been going on.‚Äù

The last strand of my humanity spoke with confidence and determination.

She leaned in closer, her eyes shimmering with something inhuman. ‚ÄúYou sleep so soundly, June. So beautifully. Your breath... it‚Äôs so warm. And the look in your eyes when you know something is wrong‚Äîit never gets old. I love seeing people like you staring into thin air, trying to make sense of the chaos.‚Äù

My voice cracked as I asked, ‚ÄúWas that you in my house? That night‚Ä¶ did you kill Milo?‚Äù

She smirked. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs ask a better question: how much longer do you think you can survive this warm little life of yours? How long can you play this game with me, little June?‚Äù

She pulled me in close and whispered into my ear, voice cold and electric with malice:

‚ÄúTonight, June dies. Tonight, June enters a new age of existence‚Äîone stripped of humanity. A new consciousness. A new will... for the one we serve.‚Äù

I tore away from her and ran to my car. As I threw the door shut and started the engine, I saw something that made my hands shake on the wheel. The car she had arrived in‚Äîit was the same car Milo had chased down the street weeks ago.
I was prey. I had been marked by whatever had possessed that body.

Driving home, I called my siblings and loved ones. I told them everything. Every terrifying detail from the last couple of months. When I got home, I locked every possible entrance to my apartment and grabbed the only weapon I owned‚Äîa small crossbow.

I sat there, in silence, waiting for her to return.

Not even an hour passed before I heard footsteps on the roof‚Äîheavy, deliberate. It was like she was probing every edge of the building, like a hungry serpent trying to find a crack in the nest of a defenseless, flightless bird.

Then silence.

But before relief could set in, I heard it‚Äîa thunderous crash, like a large object had been hurled straight through a glass window. I ran through the apartment with my crossbow raised, ready to strike at whatever hell had broken in.

And then I froze.

Milo‚Äôs corpse had been dug up and thrown‚Äîthrown‚Äîinto my apartment.

At that moment, I lost every last piece of my morality.

I picked up the crossbow. I aimed it at my own chest.

And I pulled the trigger. 

After that, I lost consciousness and woke up in a hospital, a cold, pale hand caressing my head. I turned to my side‚Äîand it was Angeline. I tried to get up and run, but I couldn‚Äôt. The pain in my chest was too immense. Moments later, my mother and father rushed into the room after hearing I had woken up. They came to hug me and told me that I had been diagnosed with severe schizophrenia the day I visited the psychiatrist. Apparently, I had refused to take the medication prescribed to me, which had led to the episode I‚Äôd experienced.

I asked my mother how she knew all of this. She pulled out her phone and showed me the call records from that day. I genuinely didn‚Äôt recall any of it‚Ä¶ but the evidence was right there, staring back at me. I reached for my own phone and quickly searched the web for the article I remembered‚Äîthe one about the supposed death of a woman from Yeager‚Äôs Flower Shop. But when I looked it up, all that came up was a normal company website with photos of Angeline smiling alongside her parents.

Relief started to flood through me. Maybe I really was sick. Maybe I still had a girlfriend. Maybe there was no sinister entity chasing me after all. I turned to hug my mother and Angeline, thanking them both for sticking by me through my mental health episode. They both smiled and cheered me on. My mother left the room to give Angeline and me some space.

‚ÄúAngeline, thank you for everything. I mean it... no one should have to go through what you‚Äôve been through these past couple of months,‚Äù I said, turning to her with a deep, grateful smile.

She looked back at me, expression unreadable. ‚ÄúNew June, you‚Äôve been quite the project. Luckily, we don‚Äôt die so easily from point-blank arrow shots like that,‚Äù she said, her voice cold. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find out what you are soon.‚Äù She grinned then, a demonic look flickering behind her eyes, and walked out of the room without another word.

I turned my face into the pillow, trying to convince myself I was just slipping again‚Äîthat the medication still needed time to work, that this was all in my head. I write to you all here and now: am I losing my mind, or am I being hunted by something veiled in darkness?

Please... be here for me.

The more I live on, the more I want her. A dark paradise lies in her eyes, and I can feel my soul being sipped away. The more I want her, the closer I get to losing everything.

I've been really into beer steaming hot dogs (finishing with high heat in butter) lately. I wanted to make a breakfast dog and thought it would be a cool opportunity to steam in something more breakfast adjacent.

My buddy used to work at a steakhouse where they incorporated coffee into their steak rub so I thought I'd apply that to the world of wieners.

TL, DR: I steamed the hot dog in cold brew coffee.

The Build:
Sabrett Hot Dog, coffee steamed
An Over Easy Egg w/ seasoned salt and pepper (which I promptly broke en route to the hot dog)
Melted sharp cheddar on a bun toasted in the air fryer
Four Pepper Medium Salsa

Okay, I know the execution and presentation isn't spectacular but GOOD GOD was this a good hot dog. Coffee steaming is a hack and a half that I definitely recommend trying for yourself.

If you're looking for a great breakfast, take this bad boy for a spin.

""Why 'Silksong,' Team Cherry's Sequel to 'Hollow Knight,' Took So Long‚Ä¶""

Hi everyone, and welcome to a special edition of Game On about a very special game that we‚Äôll be playing quite soon.

The wait is over

It‚Äôs surreal to write, but it‚Äôs true: Silksong will be out on Sept. 4.

After six years of near-total silence from the developers and enough feverish anticipation to make it the most wish-listed game on Steam, the sequel to the indie hit Hollow Knight is releasing in two weeks. Team Cherry, the small team behind both games, announced the news Thursday in a trailer.
Why did it take so long?

Often, such protracted development cycles are caused by mismanagement and result in painful burnout among the staff. But speaking to me last week on a video call from their office in Adelaide, Australia, Team Cherry Co-Founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen said that making Silksong has been nothing but a joyful process.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been having fun,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúThis whole thing is just a vehicle for our creativity anyway. It‚Äôs nice to make fun things.‚Äù

The lengthy production wasn‚Äôt the result of development challenges or obstacles, they said. They just needed all these years to ensure that Silksong was exactly the game they wanted to make.

‚ÄúIt was never stuck or anything,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúIt was always progressing. It‚Äôs just the case that we‚Äôre a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn‚Äôt any big controversial moment behind it.‚Äù

The Silksong saga started in 2017 when Team Cherry released Hollow Knight, an action-platformer set in a vast world full of cartoon bugs. A Switch version, released the following year, added to the momentum. By the end of 2018, millions of fans were raving about its polished gameplay, distinct style and impeccable vibes. As of today, the game has sold 15 million copies, Team Cherry told me, making it one of the most successful independent video games ever.
Initially, Gibson and Pellen had planned to release an expansion pack revolving around Hornet, one of its key characters. But in February 2019, they announced that the expansion had grown too big and would instead become a full-fledged sequel, titled Silksong.
Hollow Knight had been massive, and their plan at the outset was to build a smaller world for Silksong. To ensure that the game felt just as deep, they‚Äôd implement an elaborate quest system that would offer the player reasons to backtrack and revisit old locations. In contrast to Hollow Knight, which had a single town full of shops and characters to meet, there would also be multiple towns, each serving as a hub for quests.

‚ÄúEven at that point we were recognizing that it was going to become another giant thing to rival the scale of Hollow Knight or probably exceed it,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúAnd then because of how we work, obviously the world ended up being just as big or bigger. And the quest system existed. And the multiple towns existed. Suddenly you end up six, seven years later.‚Äù

It all came down to their development style, which may have been too much fun. Gibson and Pellen ‚Äî who were joined by programmer Jack Vine, composer Chris Larkin and a few contractors who helped with programming and testing ‚Äî started off by designing the core gameplay for Hornet, the game‚Äôs slick protagonist. From there, it was easy to implement and test out new ideas, even as the game grew bigger.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very fortunate that we have a development method that is so enjoyable,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúNot exactly sure how we stumbled into that. Everything comes together quickly. You can see results fast. Ideas turn into something that exist in the game almost immediately before your eyes, and that‚Äôs very satisfying. And that allows you to go off on those tangents and meet weird characters because someone‚Äôs off-handedly mentioned a weird character as an idea and the other person‚Äôs laughed, and that‚Äôs enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always working on a new idea, new item, new area, new boss,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúThat stuff‚Äôs so nice. It‚Äôs for the sake of just completing the game that we‚Äôre stopping. We could have kept going.‚Äù

The downside of this methodology was that it could have lasted forever.

‚ÄúI remember at some point I just had to stop sketching,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúBecause I went, ‚ÄòEverything I‚Äôm drawing here has to end up in the game. That‚Äôs a cool idea, that‚Äôs in. That‚Äôs a cool idea, that‚Äôs in.‚Äô You realize, ‚ÄòIf I don‚Äôt stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.‚Äô‚Äù

During the development of Hollow Knight, Gibson and Pellen frequently posted game updates and talked to players. At the end of 2019, Team Cherry posted one more update about Silksong, then went silent ‚Äî much to fans‚Äô dismay.
‚ÄúWe felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúBecause all we could really say is, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre still working on it.‚Äô‚Äù

They wanted to be particularly cautious about avoiding spoilers. Much of the thrill of Hollow Knight came from accidentally stumbling upon secret passageways or breaking down walls to find hidden bugs. Silksong has plenty of its own secrets that they didn‚Äôt want to detail before the release.

Plus, they thought Silksong would be out much sooner.

‚ÄúInstead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúProbably at the time we thought we‚Äôd go quiet for a year or two, then the game would come out.‚Äù

In 2020, as Covid disrupted most video-game productions around the world, Adelaide was able to stave off the worst of the pandemic, going months without new cases, which allowed Gibson and Pellen to continue plugging along on Silksong. ‚ÄúSeems a little odd knowing that the rest of the world has such a dramatic and isolating period,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúHere we were, going to caf√©s and having brunch.‚Äù

Silksong briefly resurfaced in 2022 during an Xbox event, which promised that all of the games shown would be out within a year. Xbox doubled down on Twitter, saying the Hollow Knight sequel would be out before June 2023.
At the time, they all thought it was true. ‚ÄúWe did genuinely believe that was the case,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúThere was a period of two to three years when I thought it was going to come out within a year.‚Äù

But the game kept growing. Silksong has more elaborate bosses than Hollow Knight, more gameplay systems and more interactivity. Gibson and Pellen wanted objects in the world to react to Hornet‚Äôs various tools, which required a ton of drawing and animation work.

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre always underestimating the amount of time and effort it‚Äôll take us to achieve things,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also that problem where, because we‚Äôre having fun doing it, it‚Äôs not like, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.‚Äô It‚Äôs, ‚ÄòThis is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let‚Äôs perpetuate this with some new ideas.‚Äô‚Äù

The longer development lasted, the more pressure Gibson and Pellen felt to ensure that everything was as fine-tuned as possible. They‚Äôd already spent four years on it ‚Äî why would they rush now? The more time they spent polishing some parts, the more time they needed to apply it consistently across the rest.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a level of finish that has to be met throughout the entire game,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúAll the way the systems interact, all the hidden work that pops up later on. It‚Äôs multiplicative. As you add stuff, the process of tying it all back together just increases.‚Äù

Throughout development, Team Cherry remained tiny, which may have extended the production time but also saved them from the slog of having to manage and delegate. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to mess with the formula and then find out it‚Äôs not fun,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúI used to manage teams in past lives. I don‚Äôt really want to do that ever again.‚Äù

Staying small also meant eschewing the production practices commonplace at many game-development studios.

‚ÄúWhat is Jira?‚Äù Gibson said when I asked if they used the task-management application.

‚ÄúIs it a software?‚Äù Pellen said, adding that they‚Äôd briefly used Trello before their account was deactivated because they didn‚Äôt use it enough.

As development dragged on, the hype for Silksong grew more feverish.
Perhaps the biggest reason Silksong took so long was that Team Cherry never had to worry about the one thing that keeps other independent developers awake at night: money.

During the production of Hollow Knight, they‚Äôd stayed lean, sometimes living off leftover triangle sandwiches that their office neighbor would bring them after meetings. ‚ÄúMy dad would sometimes pop up and give me $20,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄòOh, I‚Äôm having coffee today!‚Äô‚Äù

Thanks to their first game‚Äôs massive financial success, Gibson and Pellen no longer have to scrounge leftovers. For Pellen, who has two kids and a third on the way, that‚Äôs provided an inestimable peace of mind. For Gibson, who said he spends most of his time at the office, it hasn‚Äôt changed much. ‚ÄúI live in a very basic two-bedroom apartment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSometimes I think, ‚ÄòYou know what would be better, is a one-bedroom apartment.‚Äô Because then there‚Äôs even less to maintain.‚Äù

The game has continued to generate revenue by reaching new players, perhaps in large part due to the Silksong buzz. When the studio announced Silksong in February 2019, Hollow Knight had sold 2.8 million copies. The game has sold another 12 million copies since then, allowing Team Cherry to keep working on the sequel indefinitely without having to worry about running out of funds.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very lucky in that regard,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ever really think about it that much. Maybe that‚Äôs the privilege of it.‚Äù

As the years went on, the hype kept building. A Reddit forum dedicated to the game filled up with nonsensical blabber and made-up tweets, which users called ‚Äúsilkposts,‚Äù a variation on the expletive. Meanwhile, chat sections for video-game livestreams and Nintendo Direct events were plagued with the same feral messages repeated over and over: ‚ÄúSilksong when?‚Äù
Gibson and Pellen tuned it all out, rarely going online. They say they never read comments on YouTube or Reddit, although occasionally friends or family would send them some of the funniest ones.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice that people are passionate about the game, and that they‚Äôve obviously formed their own strange or very exciting communities around it,‚Äù Gibson said.

‚ÄúFeels like we‚Äôre going to ruin their fun by releasing the game,‚Äù Pellen said.

Once in a while, people would show up at the Team Cherry office, sometimes with their children, perhaps hoping for a Willy Wonka type experience. Inevitably, they were disappointed by what they found instead. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a grubby room with cardboard boxes,‚Äù Gibson said.

Their walls remain the same dull avocado color that they were when Team Cherry moved in more than a decade ago. They never even put up art. They‚Äôve been too busy making the game.

In early 2025, Gibson and Pellen began to see the finish line and started making plans to release the game in the fall. Players desperate for information devoured every scrap of news ‚Äî like the announcement that it would be playable at a museum in September ‚Äî hoping this might finally be the year.
Both Nintendo Co. and Microsoft Corp.‚Äôs Xbox said during live events this year that Silksong was planned for 2025, but fans were cautious. They‚Äôd been down this road before.

Meanwhile, Team Cherry kept working. The shape of the game has been finalized for a while, Pellen said. The last year or two has been all about the details ‚Äî adding small encounters, polishing everything and tying it all together.

And they‚Äôre still working to finalize things until the last possible minute. As we spoke, with Silksong a little more than three weeks out, I spotted programmer Jack Vine in the background, tweaking code for one of the game‚Äôs console ports.

Gibson and Pellen say they‚Äôre happy that the game is finally coming out ‚Äî and even happier that they will get to keep working on it, which they still find enjoyable even after seven years. They haven‚Äôt burned out or shown any desire to take a break. Instead, they‚Äôre already making big plans to add extra content to Silksong in the months and years to come.

‚ÄúLaunching it is obviously quite exciting,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúWhat comes after for us is equally as exciting.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúWe got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it.‚Äù

Stay tuned for 2032 to see how that turns out.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day ü§≠. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath ü§ó.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. 

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play video games. I'm obsessed with Satisfactory at the moment.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 6 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.

In a stunning display of diplomatic finesse and unwavering commitment to peace, Russian President Vladimir Putin has once again demonstrated his deep desire to end the war in Ukraine‚Äîby launching one of the largest aerial assaults in weeks. The attack, which included 574 drones and 40 missiles, was thoughtfully aimed at a U.S.-owned electronics factory in western Ukraine, because nothing says ""I‚Äôm ready to negotiate"" like bombing coffee machine manufacturers.

The Peace offensive Highlights:

¬∑ üéØ Precision Targeting: Russian forces expertly struck a Flex factory near the Hungarian border, ensuring that American investments in Ukraine feel the warmth of Putin‚Äôs embrace. Six workers were injured, because peace-building requires sacrifices.
¬∑ üíå Message of Goodwill: The attack, which killed at least one person and injured dozens, was accompanied by Russian officials explaining that the factory was actually a ""military-industrial complex"" in disguise. Those coffee machines? Obviously drone components.
¬∑ ü§ù Diplomatic Subtlety: Putin‚Äôs foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, clarified that security guarantees for Ukraine are pointless without Russia‚Äôs involvement. Because who knows Ukraine‚Äôs security needs better than the country invading it?.

Trump‚Äôs Reaction:
President Donald Trump, who recently rolled out the red carpet for Putin in Alaska, expressed his frustration in a characteristically measured social media post. He noted that it‚Äôs ""very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader‚Äôs country"". This insightful sports analogy‚Äîcomparing war to a football game‚Äîwas clearly intended to encourage Kyiv to play more offense, even as Putin‚Äôs defense scores own goals against civilian infrastructure.

Zelensky‚Äôs Gratitude:
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was reportedly overcome with emotion at Putin‚Äôs generosity. ""Russia is not looking for peace,"" he remarked, adding that the attack on the U.S. factory was a ""telling"" indicator of Moscow‚Äôs sincerity. He also politely declined Putin‚Äôs offer to hold peace talks in Budapest, noting that Hungary‚Äôs Viktor Orban might be too busy cozying up to the Kremlin to be a fair mediator.

The Bigger Picture:
Putin‚Äôs peace offensive comes just days after Trump hosted Zelensky and European leaders in Washington to discuss‚Äîwait for it‚Äîending the war. Russian officials, ever the helpful participants, have since demanded control of Ukraine‚Äôs Donbas region and dismissed Western security proposals as ""adventurism"". Because what‚Äôs a peace process without maximalist demands and bombs falling in the background?

As the world awaits the next round of peace talks‚Äîpossibly in Switzerland, Austria, or Turkey‚ÄîPutin‚Äôs actions speak louder than words.

1mwva6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mwva6l/is_this_enough_to_stop_a_potential_relationship/,Is this enough to stop a potential relationship,"Hello everyone! 

For some backstory, I (F24) have been talking to/dating this guy (M24) for about 4 1/2 months now. We are not dating as in being in a relationship, but we have been on countless dates and he recently lived with me short term before he moved out of our state. He is very sweet to me and I have no doubt his positive feelings towards me are genuine, despite his potential pre mature ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù. 
He told me he loved me around 2 months ago. He has wanted to be in an exclusive relationship for awhile now, but I have some hesitations.

I often end up being the emotional support for the people I love and he is no exception. I consistently go out of my way to be there for him in whichever ways I can, beyond just emotionally. He is successful for our age and does have a good head on his shoulders. He treats me well and does go out of the way on occasion to go above the norm for certain things. 

To get to the main issue- we are at a point where I am unsure if it is best to begin a full on relationship. I do not receive the same emotional support I provide for him and I have kindly expressed that over the course of our situation. And we would now be long distance. I know no one can make the decision for me, but I am more so curious about this specific situation that has now come up. 

He was in a toxic relationship that began 2 years ago and ended a little over a year ago. He isn‚Äôt the type to shit talk an ex for no reason, but I know that she was the main point of toxicity. We have mutual friends who experienced it first hand and wanted him out of the relationship. May not mean much but she is also 7 years older than us but owned a bar on his college campus. 

He is back in his college town for a work event, and he told me that she texted him asking to meet up to apologize. I am not one to be controlling and I always lead with understanding. But he verbatim said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not like I want an apology, I just want us to be cool if I see her‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be scared if I run into her at cvs‚Äù. I completely understand wanting no bad blood, but he is unlikely to return to this city again  after this event. To me, it would make more sense if he actually wanted an apology or closure but he wants to ‚Äúbe cool‚Äù. We are close enough that he would be able to express if he needed those things. He let me know he has a plan about meeting at a coffee shop, instead of just having her run by the venue during sound check. 

The reason I feel uneasy is because we are going on a trip immediately after he leaves that city, for the purpose of me figuring out where we stand. In a way it seems like he wants to see her just to see her. Which I understand and don‚Äôt fault him for. But I take relationships incredibly seriously and would be lying if I said I wouldn‚Äôt want to be with someone who wasn‚Äôt interested in opening up the past without a clear reason. He knows I won‚Äôt be upset, but he knows I‚Äôm uneasy and has gone ahead with planning it. 

I am just genuinely curious to hear your thoughts and opinions on the situation. I know we‚Äôre young and the ex thing is not a huge deal. Trust me I get that. But beginning a relationship is a big deal to me, for both of our sakes. I know this was unnecessarily long I just wanted to give details. Hoping I don‚Äôt come off crazy I‚Äôm just a little lost overall and this doesn‚Äôt help, feeling like my intuition is telling at me a bit, but I want it to work. 

TRDL; issues have arisen before even dating but willing to work though. Right before our trip to figure out if I want to begin a relationship, he wants to see his ex with lack of reason (when there could be a solid reason to do so).

Felt like a throbbing rock in my side only if compressed - I. E. Sitting or bending over for long periods. Standing up or laying down annd stretching always helped. Never really seemed related to fat/food. In Jan I got endoscopy, ultrasound and HIDA scan (using Ensure milkshake to trigger  gallbladder contraction) - my EF was 11% and imaging / blood work were all fine. 

Fast forward to May, pain still uncomfortable / concerning. Redo imaging, all good. See GI specialist #2 and redo HIDA - EF is 2.5-%. This time they gave me CCK hormone and it produced intense contractions. After getting this, it felt like my gallbladder completely gave up. I‚Äôd be bloated as a Macy‚Äôs Thanksgiving Day ballon after eating anything - fat or not. My PCP referred me to a surgeon and gave me anti-spasmodic, quick stomach emptying meds, GasX and Famatodine to manage symptoms until my surgery happened today. 

Had surgery today. Cleaned my self with their special soap, dressed in gown, they put in IV and gave me anti-nausea meds (I was VERY stressed and anxious), hydrated me and gave me something that made me feel really drunk (sedative). Rolled me back, saw the OR lights and room, gave me anesthesia and I knocked out. Woke up back in prep room, very loopy. They showed me my gallbladder (can‚Äôt remember). Said it was all fine, no stones identified. Will go to pathology. 

I‚Äôm 10 hours post-op now and feel fine other than sore abdomen - can‚Äôt do pushups/getting in and out of bed is annoying. Slightly sore throat. Very sleepy. Pressure. I haven‚Äôt had to take any pain meds at all, so pain is very manageable. I just feel loopy when I try to walk. I‚Äôll update again in a few days in case things change. But overall waiting to see when I can eat normal again‚Ä¶ normal for me is not bad at all. 


Had couple bites of subway, realized shouldn‚Äôt eat that. Had applesauce, bone broth and toast with jelly. Some coffee. 

Hope this might help someone feel less anxious. Good luck to everyone!

Ask us anything.,"Restore the kind of curiosity humans were born with ‚Äî the urge to stop, look, and wonder. We believe seeing should be the start of a journey, not the end of a scroll. Chance AI exists to turn sight into insight and everyday moments into lasting stories. Hi everyone ‚Äî we‚Äôre the **Chance AI** team. Quick intro + why we‚Äôre here.

‚Ä¢ **Why this matters:** mainstream visual search often returns shopping links or vague guesses. We‚Äôre focused on cultural and design stories ‚Äî the kind of context that turns a glance into curiosity.

‚Ä¢ **What we build:** Chance AI is a Curiosity Lens that doesn‚Äôt just label pixels ‚Äî it decodes context, history, and design meaning from anything you snap. We want people to *see to search*, not type to find.

‚Ä¢ **How we design experiences:** one click ‚Äî point, snap, learn. We intentionally removed the prompt box because users shouldn‚Äôt need to learn ‚Äúprompt grammar‚Äù to explore. The result: faster, more intuitive discovery.

‚Ä¢ **Who we are:** a small team of product, visual-algorithm, and design veterans (former OnePlus, OPPO, ByteDance, Royal College of Art collaborators) building this from New York to the world. We combine product-scale experience with art & design sensibility.

‚Ä¢ **Want to try & help shape it?** we‚Äôre running a closed beta and inviting curious travelers, designers, museum-goers, and everyday explorers. Beta perks include free premium, early access to features, and direct support from our team. Say ‚Äúbeta‚Äù below and we‚Äôll DM details / sign-up.

**How you can help right now:**

1. Post one photo (street art, a shop sign, a coffee label, a souvenir) and tell us: *what you expected vs what you hoped to learn*. We‚Äôll reply with what Chance AI surfaces and explain how we got that result.
2. Tell us bluntly: what frustrates you about visual search today? (No filter ‚Äî we want real feedback.)
3. If you want a beta invite, comment ‚Äúbeta‚Äù and we‚Äôll DM next steps.

We‚Äôll post weekly ‚ÄúSnap & Share‚Äù highlights, share product updates, and run AMAs with the team. Excited to meet curious minds here.

Living with an elderly mother, no she's not demented or suffering with a mental disorder because of it. Just making that clear. She just needs someone for the physical things she cannot do any longer.

I haven't had a proper vacation or time off in nearly ten years. No family members want to lend a hand. They never cared enough. It's depressing knowing that I am the only one who cared enough to stay and help my mom when my dad left her for another woman in 2003. 

I have anger management issues, dealing with that on the side. Mom doesn't make it easy.

All I want is a week or two of peace, no more dealing with her. She drives me batty. 

The house is always a mess. Has been since I was a kid and nothing has changed. I have made great attempts to clean out clutterd areas. Spent days on end cleaning the kitchen. All she had to do was maintain, did she? No.

I hate the clutter with a passion but feel hopeless because it always goes back to square one. Just once I would love to see something I cleaned up remain that way without me having to do 100% of the effort.

I have tried approaching her kindly, offering to clean it myself if she would just maintain it. But no.

I've given up. I feel used and hopeless. I am tired of this situation and I honestly want out. I can't afford to live solo and neither can she. So I am trapped. 

All I dream about is being lost and never finding home. 

I don't want to blow up on her but the frustration hit a high note when my cat had puked on my bed and I had no clean sheets because when she does laundry, apparently sheets don't count. Yes I usually wash them myself.

I tripped over a pile of junk and that was it. I started piling all the junk into a space and told her she either finds a proper place for it or it goes out. If at the end of this month it remains I will have a crew come clean it up. 

Atop it all, as I went through grabbing all the stuff off the coffee table, the hearing aids I bought her were just out in the open for the cats or dog to get at. Now they're not the professional 4k version, but the best I could find. 

Zero care. A little a day and the problem goes away. Hording is the obvious answer to why.

I am crying out of frustration right now and trying to stay away from her so I don't yell any more. I have no out. ",4,1755831214.0,rant,4,1.0,False

Then she told be to fold boxes, so i did, then i got yelled at for.. not doing other things?
 Then yelled at for not folding boxes again.

Then i‚Äôm yelled at for pacing.

I moved back a few years ago with a partner but we broke up a bit ago and I kind of stuck to myself for a bit. But now I'm trying to get out there!

I'm queer and wanting to find other queer people to become friends with! I also have DID, this is something I want to be upfront about as if we want to get to know each other that's something you'll learn about me fairly quickly. I am totally cool with answering questions about the disorder and people being curious so don't worry about any of that. I am very open about this in my personal life so it's something that is going to be obvious.

About me: I am hugely into outdoorsy stuff, I love going on walks and just like being outside. I used to like going out to lakes or hiking but I don't quite want to do that on my own so I haven't done it much. I like board and video games though because of work I haven't done too too much of either of those lately. I am big into World of Warcraft because I've played since Vanilla but I'm not hardcore into it or anything.

I love going places, like just walking around downtown or going out to get coffee somewhere and just chatting. I love talking about anything and everything, it's probably want I like to do the most in general. If you want to talk about it, chances are so do I. I like being there to be a listening ear or just a supportive friend, I believe in community and doing what I can for others in general.

This Can‚Äôt Be Real‚Ä¶ But It 100% Was!,"Has anyone ever just stumbled into something SO bizarrely easy that you almost feel like you‚Äôre in a fever-dream?

Because‚Ä¶what actually just happened to me?

Like, I made **$100 in ONE week** using nothing but my phone, and my main requirement was tapping through some random apps on my couch while watching The Office reruns.

I was fully prepared for one of those sketchy surveys that pay you seven cents for every six days of effort.

But (plot twist!) this was actually legit.

Here‚Äôs literally what went down, because I‚Äôm still TECHNICALLY confused and also wildly hyped:

---

### ü§ë Step 1: My Hyper-Skeptical Scroll

- Saw a thread about getting paid to ""test new apps.""
- Eye-rolled SO HARD, but the curiosity (and let‚Äôs be honest, desperation for coffee money) won.
- Clicked on **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**, expecting a scam alert to go off.

---

### ü§î Step 2: Spoiler‚ÄîNo Scams Yet?

- Page looked‚Ä¶okay? (No angry pop-ups, no ‚ÄúGive us your SSN‚Äù crap. BIG RELIEF.)
- Registered using just my email. (No weird info demanded.)
- Got a list of apps to download and specific actions to take on each.

---

### üò≥ Step 3: Wait, That Was It?!

- Downloaded some new games, one finance tracker (ignored the budgeting advice, sorry!).
- Did a few daily tasks like logging in, completing simple tutorials, or using them for 2-3 minutes.
- Each app had crystal clear instructions, like ""Open the app & play level 2, then screenshot the result.‚Äù

Kept checking my progress on **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** to make sure things were tracking. It updated almost immediately after task completion.

---

### üí∏ Step 4: Real, Spendable Money (NOT Monopoly Bucks?!)

- Earnings summary actually went up fast. Downloading the highest paying apps? BOOM, $5 here, $8 there.
- After five days, I had $73 just from staring at my phone while waiting for my pasta to boil. üòµ
- End of the week? A grand total of $100, plus a few cents and a pile of digital confetti in my head.

Requested payout on **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**‚Ä¶and yes, got paid. Into my PayPal, no extra hoops.

---

### üëâ **Would I recommend it?**

Let me be blunt: I‚Äôve tried a lot of ‚Äúside hustle‚Äù stuff before and usually ended up with fifty cents and a headache.
But this was fast, almost brainless, and honestly harder to believe than my car‚Äôs extended warranty calls.

If you‚Äôre bored, have a phone, and want to test if your disbelief is stronger than your bank balance, try **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**.

Smart, cutie , very friendly and just someone na you feel comfortable to be with. 

Lord , ganahan kay ko magtan aw niya, she cute and the way she talks ba like nindot tutukan iya mata. I know she is in a relationship , but I am the type of person na if I like you ganahan ko makahibaw ka. If I like you not in a romantic way , like makadirect ra jud ko ug ingon sa imo. But if I like you , na in a way na i think of you na pwede uyabon , mashy ko to tell you but I'll give hints. I joke and tease ginagmay and all, i do eye contact and magtutuk ko nimu na ganahan ko makabaw ka na nagtan-aw ko nimu and I want to see how you react. 

So yeah , during the training class set up via Zoom. Mag joke around , if maabot namu duha ang sungog like mo baws sad jud ko ginagmay giving her hints , na I like her jud. Usahay , I tease her around na mag coffee me sometimes, or like e add sa second account dili lang sa main. Pina joke , but I really want to see how she reacts ing-ana na joke if ganahan ba siya mo padayon ko ing-ana na approach. Mo tan-do2 ra sad siya, and then say ""sige sige"" but I never did really. Adto ra to taman. 

Duting training if naa chance na moduol siya sa akoa station, and guide me sa akong call. I'll make sure na mo tan-aw jud ko niya eye to eye ! Hahahha para shell feel na i like her gyud, looking at her reactions ,smile raman siya , delulu lang gyud siguro ko and I feel like this is how she is with everyone pud or me lng . Im confuse man kay I  dont want to feed my delulu thoughts and if everytime magtudlo siya nako, she'll lean closer to me duol sa akong nawng and I'll at her. ,straight to eyes and pretend to listen I really just want to see her reaction at that moment .Girl, she smilling , delulu ko or not and then she touched my cheeks usahay if mag-explain na siya ana na time and confuse2 akong face kuno and then tells me ""cute gyud oi"" hahahahahah and then one time she compliments me I have pretty eyes daw during this ing-ani na time. This scene happend mga butang natog more than 3 times. 5 or less ana . Wala nay labot ng magtambay siya duol sa akong station during call training floorwalk , thats just me being delulu basin ganahan ra jud siya didto na side kay talkative akong tapad. Idk. Do i try not to think about mga little things ana. Hahah 


So positive man akong mga little hints. Try droppinh DMs sa workteams. Asking her if ""asa na siya ? Why wala pa siya nabalik sa Zoom meeting namu!"" Like mga ing-ana na question na letting her know na nangita ko niya. Of like if mag off siya cam sa Zoom. I'll tell her , ""Pag On camera Miss , di ko kita nimu"" mga ing-ana ra jud .

She loves reading book, I have a lot of books. I used to read a lot , so one time I told her. I'll give you one puhon. And then I did.  So didto na book. Naa sentence didto na 'You should write your goal in a piece of paper , para everyday nimu makit-an' para naa kay clear sight sa imong goal, and that one way to manifest it. What I did ? Gibutang nako iya name sa paper . Gi insert nako didto na page and highlighted using a highlighter that phrase . To give hint that ""she is my goal"" and I like her. 
> wala pa ko ask if kita ba siya ato na note or kahibaw ba siya ako buot pasabot ? 3 days ago paman gud to nako gihatag hahahahah. Well be asking her again siguro after 1 month , if nabasa na ba niya to or not. Haha 


So , after that , delulu lang siguro everytime mo agi ko dapit sa iyang station wala manay paki sa mangagi but everytime mo agi nako run, mo lingi jud siya. Or maybe delulu lang jud ko. Hahahahaha anyways ,

Sa work Teams , thru DMs , so she was telling me she brought a book with her , pahulam daw unta niya nako pero na findout niya during our conversation ani na time dili mi same ug genre na ginabasa. So ana siya dili na lang , kay dili ra ko ma interesado. Dont get us wrong , conversation na moment is civil lang .. so yah ana ayaw dili na lang. So I told, ay sige lang ari na lang ""para naa koy rason e message ka"" hahahahahhahahahah but she replied ba. ""It will not interest you lagi."" So ako ,na broken heart ko dayon , that moment , so mo insist jud siya na dili na lang , and says it will not interest me bisan kabaw na siya na ganahan ra ko manghuwam para naa koy rason. So basin dili sad siguro siya interesado nako , in a way na i like her. Murag that was the sign I was looking for to stop na phising attention sa iya and like giving her hints. But at the end of the shift , gitawag jud ko niya and told me "" Nara oh , baga ra ba ni, humana nig basa 1 week ha ?"" So am like ü´£ nag butterflies in my stomach na sad imong auntie like , dont feed my delulu mind sad bi hahahahahha . 

Mao pa na siya . Need advise! Idk , should I stop giving her hints ? Please make her stop!! Dapat fucos lang gyud siya sa iyang uyab. Ganahan ra ko makahibaw siya na ganahan ko niya , dapat e reject niya akong subtle ways and feelings para madivert akong attention sa lain hahahaha . ",1,1755830519.0,cebuBPORelationship,0,1.0,False

To start, I'm 32yo and started drinking around 13yo. I decided to quit on July 15 2025, so it hasn't been too long but honestly i feel great already. I apologize in advance for the long post. 

I started dating my now wife in 2013. We were both a little more than a year out of high school and at that point I was partying every weekend as an excuse to drink along with adding a little ""extra"" to my coffee every morning all while only being 19. After a few months of dating I realized that she was who I needed in my life and I needed to do everything I could to make sure that she stayed, and she made it pretty clear that the drinking was a problem. We both have alcoholism in our family, but back then I still wasn't even worried about it. Right around my 21st birthday I decided that I would stop liquor and try to only drink craft beer. It was my way of ""stopping"" while still enjoying the social aspect of it and maintaining the ability to drink. That worked for me for a long time. Once we got married and went on our honeymoon I decided to try a mixed drink, and from there I started drinking more of them which ultimately led me back to straight whiskey. I still never ""lost control"" but the drinking was back. I was honestly very proud that I felt able to manage it. 

Flash forward to July this year. Still doing ok ""managing"". We just had our second child and so I was home for a while from work. One day driving home from dropping our oldest at daycare a song came on that changed my life forever. Right then and there in the truck I decided that I was done for good. I want to be able to tell my kids that I beat it completely and I don't just ""manage it"". I want to be the best role model I can. 

For anyone wondering, the song was ""My Cross"" by Jelly Roll. The main part of the song is ""my cross to carry, won't be yours to pick up"" and I want to live that to the fullest. I urge everyone who might need help to go listen to it. But most of all, don't be afraid to reach out. If your struggling, talk to someone, read someone's story or just find inspiration somewhere. Everyone has or needs their own reason to quit. This was mine and hopefully it will help at least one other person.",8,1755830469.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False

Had an MRI done when it first started and all was normal. I‚Äôve seen a vestibular physio regularly throughout this time. Usually every few weeks but increasing when I‚Äôm not well. 

I started feeling off and waking up with some spinning at the beginning of July. I‚Äôve kind of learned to live with these symptoms so thought nothing of it and just scheduled another appointment with my physio.

I normally don‚Äôt drink coffee but on one peculiar day in late July I had a small amount at work. Within an hour I felt like my whole vestibular system was on fire. Not necessarily spinning but like I was falling and off balance. Like my body couldn‚Äôt process movement properly. These symptoms stayed like that for 5 days. Even went to the ER bc I thought it was dying. They did blood work, chest x ray etc. but nothing came up. My family doctor who I‚Äôve seen since then thinks there may have been something slopped into the coffee at work.

I‚Äôve since seen my physio for treatment who has done the epeley manoeuvre and checked my eyes for nystagmus with the goggles. I always tend to have some small amount of nystagmus but at my first treatment I definitely had more. He seems to think my central nervous system is affected as well most likely bc of whatever was in the coffee or if I had some sort of super caffeine reaction. Second treatment we did liberation to try to unstick the crystals and it seemed to trigger it again and I‚Äôve felt dizzy / off balance, brain fog for the last couple weeks. This has been going on for 4 weeks now.  I‚Äôm slowly feeling better but very slowly. Still having dizzy spells. 

I also will add I have cervogenic or whatever neck vertigo as well which also seems to be acting up. 

I have a referral out to an ENT who will hopefully do another MRI to be safe.

In the modern era, and ESPECIALLY on apps/online, coffee dates should be the standard.

Coffee dates are a low pressure, inexpensive way to meet in a public place and determine if you‚Äôre even compatible.

Some reality checks:
- I don‚Äôt actually know you.
- We have to establish compatibility
- It‚Äôs low pressure for both parties
- you can go on a second date with more expectations.
- the cost of the date does not correlate with the quality of the relationship 

Maybe I‚Äôm a cold hearted bitch. I‚Äôm not rolling out the red carpet for someone I don‚Äôt know, and If someone spent bands on me I‚Äôd think they were trying to pull one on me. So‚Ä¶coffee is low pressure filtration process.


Edit: I did say online - I did not say in person. Why I said online is because you don‚Äôt have in person interactions yet and that can change the dynamic/interest, hence why a low pressure situation should be normalized.

I understand these machines are similar or the same as the La Pavoni Europiccola. It seems slightly odd to me that a 20yo machine would be still almost half the price as a new one (retail $AUD1000-1200 here) but that retail is for the Europiccola not Gaggia and I understand that maybe they don't make these Gaggia machines any more.

1mwuh7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1mwuh7b/need_a_bit_of_help_getting_started/,Need a bit of help getting started,"Hey everyone.  I want to start IF, and was wondering if there was a free app that people liked so I could use it as a guide. I am a teacher and a toddler mom whose body has aggressivley entered perimenopause this past year. I tend to be isolated a lot of the time due to my schedule/responsibilities/boyfriend's schedule. He's not home a lot, so I need a little more motivation than just my own brain if that makes sense. I only want to lose about 10-15 lbs, but also want to sleep better, eat better, feel better, be stronger for my little girl. I want her to be proud of me and I want to feel good about myself. It's not terrible, but it could be better. School is starting back up and I wake up at 5, leave by 6, get to work (hopefully by 8 lol), return anytime between 4-5:30 depending on traffic. I love black coffee but can't have any after noon because I have anxiety and it disrupts my sleep. I love tea, and have a good idea of simple things I can eat every day and some better choices I can make for when I decided to get food on the block. My daughter and I are also moving back in with my parents for a little while, and my boyfriend is moving back with his mom so we can save up some money and find a less expensive place in this atrocious rent situation and give her a better life and not have to say no all the time. I figured it would be a great time to start since living in someone else's house can make meal prepping difficult. I just need some help getting started. If anyone has any app/website/social recs I would greatly appreciate it.  üôè ",1,1755829362.0,intermittentfasting,1,1.0,False

1mwufa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/casualconlang/comments/1mwufa7/collaborative_project_indoshemic_a_universal/,Collaborative Project: Indoshemic - A Universal Auxlang Based on Actual Language Contact,"I'm starting a collaborative project for a universal auxiliary language with a twist. Instead of Esperanto's European bias, **Indoshemic** [in.do.Àà Ée.mik] is based on the four language families that gave us our most universal loanwords: algebra, chocolate, coffee, and tea/chai.

**The Name:**
*Indoshemic* blends *Indo-* (Indo-European) + *Shem-* (Semitic, from Hebrew ◊©◊ù ""name/renown"") + *-ic* suffix. It represents the historical bridge between these major language families in global vocabulary transmission.

**The Concept:**
These words exist in nearly every language because they followed major historical trade and cultural exchange routes. By using the source families (Semitic, Sino-Tibetan, Indo-European, Uto-Aztecan), we get a more genuinely representative auxlang.

**Current grammar mix:**
- **Semitic**: 3-consonant roots (k-t-b = ""write""), dual number
- **Sino-Tibetan**: 3-tone system, classifiers, SOV word order  
- **Indo-European**: 5-case system, familiar verbal morphology
- **Uto-Aztecan**: Person prefixes/suffixes, ejective consonants

**Base-8 Counting System:**
Uses 8 digits: *sifr* (0), *mel* (1), *wej* (2), * Éam* (3), * îon* (4), * Éelu* (5), *xes* (6), *sab* (7)
- *mel-sifr* = 10‚Çà = 8‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ (""one-zero"")
- *mel-sifr-sifr* = 100‚Çà = 64‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ (their ""hundred"")

**Sample sentences:**

*Katab-wan-es  îalgabra  Ée-mel nd√¢r-ma-te.*
[ka.Ààtab.wan.es  îal.Ààga.bra  Ée.mel ÀàndaÀêr.ma.te]
katab-wan-es  îalgabra  Ée-mel nd√¢r-ma-te
write-AGENT-PL algebra CL.FLAT-one see-PERF-3PL
""The writers studied one (book of) algebra.""

*Ni  Éaj kafƒì-el ti-sl√¢m-kwe.*
[ni  Éaj ka.ÀàfeÀê.el ti.ÀàslaÀêm.k ∑e]
ni  Éaj kafƒì-el ti-sl√¢m-kwe
1SG tea coffee-DAT 2SG-peace-FUT
""I (choose) tea; you will be at peace with coffee.""

**Why this approach works better:**
- Based on *actual* historical language contact, not European colonialism
- Incorporates features familiar to speakers of major world languages
- Reflects real patterns of how humans have shared concepts globally
- Name itself honors the biblical and geographic origins of linguistic diversity

**What I need help with:**
- Expanding triconsonantal root vocabulary
- Developing classifiers for different cultural contexts
- Creating writing system reflecting the mixed heritage
- Working out how this would actually function as an auxlang

My and my girlfriend (42 & 35) are foodies and love traveling for pastries and fine dining. We are coming for Copenhagen for food and coffee and it would be nice to have someone that can have a fun conversation. I don't know if this is a table or shared space, when I booked I'm pretty sure I selected table but I don't see anything on the reservation.

DM me with who are you.

I'm selling the reservation the extra seat at cost, DKK 4400 +DDK110 (whatever fee is that they charged).

We don't drink, so we won't be doing pairing.
