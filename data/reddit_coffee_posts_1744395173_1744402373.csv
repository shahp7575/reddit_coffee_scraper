My husband and I just rented our first unfurnished apartment (around 60-70m2, living room, bedroom, toilet and kitchen) and are currently planning on how to go about furnishing it. I'm looking for advices on which brands I should target for different things that I need. For us, these are the necessities:

1. Bed and Mattress

2. Fridge

3. Coffee table

4. Two workstations

5. Washing machine

6. Dishwasher

7. Couch

How much should we spend on this list? We are aiming for a budget of 1500-2000. Does that sound realistic? Would that mean the stuff I buy will probably stop working in a year?

Apart from this, any tips, tricks and insights will be VERY much appreciated. :) This is daunting, of course, but we are both very excited.

NOTE: we do not own a car or a driving licence but can pull in a favour from friends maybe twice. :)

I just got this sofa a few days ago (1st & 2nd pic), but I‚Äôm realizing I really miss having a chaise and putting my feet up on something comfy when watching tv.

I can return it and swap it for the same model *with* a reversible chaise (shown in the stock photo). I‚Äôd just have to take it apart, which is doable‚ÄîI‚Äôm just trying to decide if it‚Äôs worth the hassle.

I do have two pouf ottomans, but they‚Äôre lower than the sofa, so stretching out feels a little awkward‚Äînot a huge deal, just slightly off.

Do you think the version with the chaise (2nd, 3rd & last pic) would look better or make more sense in the space?

Or‚Ä¶ is there such a thing as 20-inch high pouf ottomans? That might help keep the room feeling more open!

Also wondering:

* What kind of coffee table (and shape) would work best here? 
   * Or should I just keep the one I have?
* Should I consider changing the TV stand?

Just a heads up: I‚Äôm selling the lamps and planning to get a tall overhead lamp, plus a small table and lamp for each side.

Would love your thoughts! I‚Äôm aiming for something that feels cozy, inviting, and functional and LOOKS nice. üíõ

  
TIA!

Steves do her travelogue aka future homeschooling J‚Äôeography curriculum. Now, instead of Tru! or Ra! coming along on the trip, ¬†Sage! and Beige! get to tag along at the ripe old age of 2 months. I did make a drinking/inhale game out of Jed! saying ‚Äúgirls/ladies/twins‚Äù but I will just type (drink) when we get to those instances. I apologize for the additional delay but Mr. Swiss and I started watching Severance and my mind was whirling from the first season. Additionally, Beige! seems to be the twin that is dressed in prints, while Sage! is the plain colored fabric twin. But without anymore ado, let‚Äôs jump in!

Jed! and Kath! each push a stroller as they power walk along. Sage! and Beige! have their bottles propped up with blankets as they roll along. It‚Äôs much more efficient than Perm‚Äôs Nursing Platform would be.

J!: How you feelin about the trip to Hawaii?

K!: It‚Äôs a long flight with just the girls (drink) just half our kids

Yeah, we get it Kath! You have the fastest uterus in the west‚Ä¶ern part of Arkansas. Jed! goes on to ask if she‚Äôs ready for Hawaii and of course the little globe trotter is ready for the sun and warmth. Finally satisfied Jed! turns his attention to Beige!, and asks ‚Äúyou ladies excited?‚Äù (drink) Beige! looks at her father and blinks slowly. This is the most bored infant I‚Äôve ever seen. She must not like his phone case. Kath! wheels Sage!‚Äôs Doona back to be even with Beige! as they are introduced for this vlog. Sage! looks bored also but at the same time looks like she‚Äôs too tired to fuss.

A music montage precedes a J‚ÄôRoll Call of the J‚ÄôLocust herd swarming out to Hawaii. The Planes are in the row behind the !‚Äôs and since the plane didn‚Äôt run out of fuel over the ocean, I‚Äôm going to guess he fought the urge to get up and mansplain the flight controls until the pilots let him fly. Beige! seems to be Jed!s favorite, while Sage! stretches out on a seat. Both of them get their little silver wings and I‚Äôd bet Ra! is the only ! child without a pair of wings. If they don‚Äôt take Ra on a plane soon, her buddy team lieutenants will outrank her.

Aloha! is the new Hola! as the herd of J‚ÄôLocusts touch down on Hawaii. Beige! sleeps as Sage! stares. J! mentions how good the Twins! (drink) were on the flight, as Kath! points out that it‚Äôs 8 pm back in Arkansas and Beige! is sticking to the strict schedule I assume reigns with Grammy! and the team of mother‚Äôs helpers constantly on hand to help.

As the 4!s arrive at a restaurant, we get a new J‚ÄôRoll Call to see who all has arrived. The Planes, The !s, J‚ÄôAnnoying Orange, Sperm, J‚ÄôLost In The Airport, J16, J18 and J19. Sperm tries to act like he isn‚Äôt wearing a human suit while also looking like he‚Äôs 6 months along with J20. Kath! quirkily rolls her eyes and shrugs her shoulders as the camera points in her direction.

Jed! lays back onto a bed next to the swaddled and sleeping Twins! as he informs us that ‚Äúthese girls‚Äù (drink) were resting before¬†[Lodge's](https://www.reddit.com/r/SnarkyRecapsBySwiss/comments/1255efv/the_vlog_formerly_known_as_duggars_gone_mild_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)¬†wedding and reception tomorrow. After that, it‚Äôs island explorations. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking forward to it‚Äù says Jed!, including the Twins! (drink)¬† who are sleeping and not reacting to the camera in their faces. The 2 month olds are probably feeling the effects of jet lag and couldn‚Äôt give a flying suck at a rolling bottle what the itinerary is. Jed! for his part just wants to sleep as well as ‚ÄúBerlin‚Äù a reference I can‚Äôt find in their European Fertility Tour¬†[European Fertility Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/SnarkyRecapsBySwiss/comments/125q5s5/the_s_international_babymoon_extravaganza_part_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)¬†, but I assume is from that.

The next morning, Jed! walks out onto the back patio and up to the hot tub and pool where the various Duggalos and their corresponding Duggalettes-in-love mill about or sit with their feet in the water. OfJ‚ÄôOrchestra Pit holds one of the Twins! as Kath! holds the other. J‚ÄôAnnoying Orange sits down and winces as he adds his feet to the hot water while Jed! zooms in on their technical ocean view. Beige! getting some face time in with her mother as her father gives her some screen time. Again, Kath! is asked if she likes it in Hawaii. Yeah, she loves the short sleeves. Kath! dips Beige!s toes into the water and the baby doesn‚Äôt even blink. Kath! scrys her child‚Äôs lack of reaction to the warmed water and concludes that Beige! ‚Äúwants to live there‚Äù. Whatever you say, chickadee.

This group of the J‚ÄôLocust herd meets up with the rest of them at breakfast. Kath! has the Twins! bottles as she jumps into her usual pontification on her favorite meal, breakfast. There are three things that she wants to try but first Jed! tries to pronounce a Hawaiian word. This leads to J‚ÄôAnnoying Orange beginning to awkwardly dance when Jed! says they are ‚Äúvibing‚Äù as Kath! says this segment is Jed! trying in vain to properly pronounce the words around them. She. Sounds. Hangry. Just kidding, it‚Äôs a valid shot. Meanwhile the !‚Äôs encourage J‚ÄôAnnoying Orange to ‚Äúbreak it on down‚Äù. Next up is a shift to the swarm of J‚ÄôLocusts outside with ridiculous amounts of sugary coffee drinks.

After loading up the rental with the Twins! plus J18 and J19, Jed! drives down the road, eyes firmly on his gigantic dome mid-screen as Kath! does the head tilt she thinks makes her look cute and relatable as she tries to get her head in the shot also. Kath! chips that they‚Äôre on the way to the wedding with ‚Äúour girls‚Äù(drink) and includes J18 and J19 as well as the Twins!. Is there a Baby Sitter‚Äôs Club-esque schedule at TTH or something? Kath! gives a shout out to the green luscious landscape that hasn‚Äôt changed since her¬†[previous trip to Hawaii less than 2 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/SnarkyRecapsBySwiss/comments/13u8i2l/the_s_fertility_tour_part_2_babymoon_booglaoo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

The J‚ÄôLocust swarm rides a party barge to the ceremony location. Okay, maybe it‚Äôs more of a passenger ferry than a party barge but I digress. The Twins! sleep through the whole thing. The Duggalos and Duggalettes arrive and Jed! points out the obvious bride and groom, being the only people up front with J‚ÄôOrchestra Pit, the officant. Jed! then swings the camera to Kath‚Äôs Nike short dress and says ‚Äúhere‚Äôs my bride‚Äù. Y‚Äôall, I hope they edit out the Nike dress when they use this as their curricula at an SOTDRT satellite school, yet to be named.

The next little montage of shots should be titled ‚Äúsleeping babies, scenic backdrop‚Äù, then it goes into J‚ÄôOrchestra Pit and the imminent Mr. and Mrs. Lodge. There aren‚Äôt attendants and somehow J‚ÄôAnnoying Orange wasn‚Äôt even considered for a part in the wedding. They were thick as thieves on the trip to Europe and Isreal. Either way, after the ceremony, everyone gets on the party barge and is led in the Hula. Kath!s dancing knocks off Beige!s blanket onto the floor of the party barge as Sperm sits the Hula out up front by the bow. Clearly his hypocrisy only goes so far. Jed! stops filming.

Kath! and Jed! push Sage! and Beige! respectively as they discuss the wedding. Kath! gushes ‚Äúsoooo gorgeous‚Äù as Jed! says ‚Äúthese girls‚Äù (drink) did amazing. Beige! is slightly awake and somewhat waves. Jed! goes right from annoying his children to annoying his siblings and in-loves. He asks everyone he passes if they did the Hula like he‚Äôs going to give the final list of sinful children to Sperm so he can fine them or whatever he does to control them now. Prince Preaching tries to avoid Jed! as he runs towards the men‚Äôs room as Jed! is inhabited by his father and claims Prince Preaching‚Äôs Hula didn‚Äôt impress Jed!, potential family snitch. This ends the reception footage as the !s jump to a shave ice shop, an ‚Äúauthentic Hawaiian treat‚Äù. Does anyone know if Hawaiian Punch trademarked that phrase?

The next day Kath!, in a white and day-glo 80‚Äôs-esque ball cap that says Hanalei, narrates as Jed! drives. J‚ÄôAnnoying Orange and J16 sit in the middle seats as J19, an Irish twin herself, ¬†sits in the way back betwixt the Twins! They are going to go up in a helicopter for a tour. Apparently, J‚ÄôAnnoying Orange doesn‚Äôt get to go up in the chopper due to lack of seating and this being a couple‚Äôs trip with the Planes and the J‚ÄôOrchestra Pits. J16 and J19 are along to watch the children and either J‚ÄôAnnoying Orange is still nursing a crush on Kath! or he‚Äôs there to chaperone the baby-sitters. Also the 2 Lost girls have already gone up on the tour. Also, sidenote, who picked J‚ÄôAnnoying Orange as the one that would be the last bachelor standing? He has 50/50 odds since just he and J‚ÄôLost In The Airport are the only unmarried Duggalos. Kath! zooms in and mocks someone else filming content coming ever so close to self-awareness yet bathing in hypocrisy as usual. That cruel Duggar humor is second nature to her. They walk up the ramp of a beige building and even though Kath! was joking about ‚Äúreporting live‚Äù and laughing at Jed! saying ‚ÄúKoo-why-uh‚Äù. What pisses her off is Jed! joking about how he‚Äôs glad they finished their estate planning, but that helicopter and planes aren‚Äôt covered. Kath! scampers through the door and up to the J‚ÄôOrchestra Pits. Jed! is almost drunkenly trying to keep the estate planning and death ‚Äújoke‚Äù going by saying ‚Äúif we die‚Ä¶oh no‚Äù. Kath! and the J‚ÄôOrchestra Pits comment that they just need their photo up on the wall of the famous passengers. ¬†The J‚ÄôLocust herd files out to their assigned seats under a pavilion and I hope J‚ÄôPlanes isn‚Äôt going to try and take the throttle or mansplain the controls to the pilot. The J‚ÄôOrchestra Pits give an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on camera‚Äù smile and some sort of hand sign. The Planes are in the front because of course they are. Jed! gives a fist bump as the scenery outside begins to show off. The b-roll on Kath! Steves Pacific Isles Jeography Curriculum is stunning, I‚Äôll give them that. I wonder if the ! kids will end up going to their father‚Äôs alma mater of SOTDRT or if they will set up a satellite campus. Kath! takes over filming and shows the whole bunch of her in-laws stricken with the motion sickness they all know they have and yet still don‚Äôt use anything to prevent it.

Back on the ground, CinderJana ‚Äúfinally‚Äù gets her banana bread but alas, it has molded. J16 points out that the sell by date was 2 days ago. Kath! launches into a lament about this not being the Hawaii they know as she encourages CinderJana, Princess Preaching, to go get her money back.

Jed! takes over filming as they are waiting for the plane going to Oahu with a Twin! on his lap. He asks her if she‚Äôs ready for Oahu. The Twin! doesn‚Äôt move. Guess she doesn‚Äôt know. Jed! pushes a stroller as J19 takes over pushing for the other one as the rest of the group carries their luggage and other detritus with them. Jed! and his stroller leads the group down the escalator. As he looks back he sees Kath! has reclaimed the other stroller at the back of the group.

Kath! excitedly shows off the red rental Jeep. It apparently isn‚Äôt as big as they thought because the seating ends up only holding 5. J‚ÄôAnnoying Orange sits in the shotgun seat, Jed! drives as the Twins end up with one behind Jed! and the other is in the middle seat next to Kath!. The J‚ÄôOrchestra Pits also got a red rental Jeep. Jed! sticks his gigantic cranium and then camera out of the sunroof to show J‚ÄôOrchestra Pit behind them. Unfortunately, he doesn‚Äôt drop the phone and lose the footage. Jed! et al. make it to the next hotel and Jed! wastes no time in sticking his phone into the Twins!‚Äô faces after a quick shot off of the balcony after sunset. ‚ÄúHey, little girls‚Äù (drink) and as Beige! makes a sound, Jed! gives a slight chuckle and backs away.

Next, the J‚ÄôLocust swarm goes to a courtyard for ice cream, standing in a circle with the Twins! in their strollers, tucked safely against the wall. Poor Tru! wishes they had been so smart when he was this little, when in fact his uncle had to move Tru! and his bouncy seat away from the grill that was on and in use. Also of note is that J17 and J18 have the same black and white striped shirt. Do they just buy 2 or 3 of the same pieces?

Kath! holds both Twins! now dressed identically and now rendered indistinguishable. They are then held to the side so their father can see that their butts are in fact covered with a tiny pair of shorts each. ‚ÄúTheir first shorts‚Äù coos their mother, as in an alternate timeline where they stayed off camera, Perm just woke up in a cold sweat that her granddaughters were being dressed in shorts. Kath‚Äôs sweatshirt says ‚Äúlakeside living‚Äù which sounds much better than ‚ÄúRV lot adjacent house‚Äù. Can‚Äôt blame her for churching that one up. Somehow, Sage! and Beige! have already seen the beach, but their parents have not. The Lost Girls Nanny Service must have arranged a field trip. Do we get to see the beach? No, they all go to the pool. One Twin is shown in a little mesh tent, while her sister is held. Jed! swings the camera around to show all of the J‚ÄôLocusts at the pool. We then follow the herd of J‚ÄôLocusts all around the vistas, lookouts and wild life. J‚ÄôAnnoying Orange had a wild bird in his room and the video of getting it out draws Jed!s attention.

The next day, and the last day in Hawaii, is a full day. They don‚Äôt leave until eleven and I‚Äôve never been more sure Kath‚Äôs mom probably lives with them because can you imagine the jet lag with 2 toddlers wide awake the second you get home? OfJ‚ÄôOrchestra Pit has found a lovely spot for breakfast. Jed! thinks it‚Äôs reminiscent of ‚Äúthe big house‚Äù and I don‚Äôt see it.

1jwz1ja,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jwz1ja/the_spookysplorers98_case/,The SpookySplorers98 Case,"My name is Faith Bowman. I am a detective with the Louisiana State Police. At least‚Ä¶ I am right now. Truth be told, once this story is out there, I will probably be fired. The higher-ups will know I was the one who leaked this story, name attached to it or not, but I refuse to stay quiet on this. I saw what happened to those children. People need to know the truth. The parents need to know. Something has to be done.

Four weeks ago, I was placed on a multi-case missing persons investigation in New Orleans. The people missing were three young teenagers: 14-year-old Austin Gill, 14-year-old Cecil York, and 13-year-old Kamran Roth. All three boys were reported missing on the same day by the children‚Äôs parents. A connection was quickly drawn between the three disappearances due to the three boys being close friends for many years and sharing a hobby of making and posting videos on a YouTube channel referred to as ‚ÄúSpookySplorers98‚Äù.

According to the boys‚Äô parents and my personal watching of the channel‚Äôs content, SpookySplorers98 was a channel dedicated to a style of content that has begun trending on the internet over the past few years referred to as ‚Äúanalog horror‚Äù. From my understanding, the content is about telling scary stories through the lens and limitations of older, outdated technology. The parents told me that the boys were very passionate about this hobby, going as far as to purchase an old camcorder, record the videos, and convert the film to digital before editing the video and posting it online in order to capture the most ‚Äúauthentic feel‚Äù.

The boys only had two videos on their channel; one of them was a video of the boys going through the woods looking for Bigfoot, and the other video was of the boys exploring an abandoned barn that the parents informed me was on Austin‚Äôs uncle‚Äôs property. In both videos, Austin and Cecil were present and on camera. As the videos went on and ‚Äúscary‚Äù things happened, it was clear that Kamran was most likely just off-screen, making haunting noises and throwing things around, something that was later confirmed to me by Kamran‚Äôs parents. While the content was not made for people in my demographic, the boys were very talented, and you could see the passion they put into their hobby. When questioned about where the boys might have gone, both the Gills and Yorks did not have an answer, however, the Roth parents believed they might have an idea.

The boys were determined to go record at a documented ‚Äúhaunted‚Äù location. While New Orleans is known for many paranormal and spiritual places, Kamran couldn‚Äôt stop mentioning one specific location: the Lindy Boggs Medical Center. The Lindy Boggs Medical Center is an abandoned hospital on the northern end of the city. He would constantly bring up how they should make a video there and how cool it would be, but his parents understandably refused, pointing out the dangers of the building. While the hospital is very popular with urban explorers, it is also known to be a hot spot for drug deals, homeless, and junkies. The Roths told me that if I should look for the boys, the hospital might be the best place to start.

Soon after this, I had a police unit scouring the hundreds of rooms in search of the missing boys. After a few hours of searching, a police officer brought me a promising sign, a JVC GR-AXM230 camcorder. The battery was dead, but the appearance of the camera perfectly matched the description of the boys‚Äô camera given by the parents. I sent it off to evidence with the orders to have the contents of the camera converted to film so that the content could be reviewed. The rest of the hospital was searched, but no other signs of the boys were found.

By the end of the day, I had a fresh VHS tape sitting on my desk with a label stuck to it containing the case file‚Äôs number. I was instructed to watch the tape, transcribe the details of the footage, and look for anything that might clue us in on what happened to the missing children. I dug the old rolling television with VHS player from the back of a storage closet, sat down with a cup of coffee, and popped the tape into the player. The box television crinkled to life with a static hum before the tape began to play.

The following is a copy of the tape‚Äôs transcription:

\--------------------------------------------------

(Footage opens with a close-up of Cecil York‚Äôs face. He is squinting as a light shines in his eyes. The time marked in the corner reads 10:42 p.m. Cecil swats at the camera.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúAh! Austin cut it out! You know that flashlight‚Äôs bright!‚Äù

Austin (laughing): ‚ÄúWhat? I just needed to make sure the lighting was good.‚Äù

(Austin shakes the light more, causing Cecil to squint harder. The camera then pans around to show the outside of the Lindy Boggs Medical Center.)

Austin: ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm thinking we‚Äôll shoot the intro out here and then move inside for the next shot.‚Äù

Kamran: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I‚Äôll come in?‚Äù

(Austin turns the camera to show Kamran.)

Austin: ‚ÄúExactly. Gotta set up the atmosphere first. So, for this first shot, you just sit back and hold still. Don‚Äôt want people pointing out there being three footsteps this time. Cecil, you come over here and walk a little in front of me.‚Äù

(Cecil steps into the left frame of the picture.)

Austin: ‚ÄúAlright, here we go.‚Äù

(The two boys slowly start approaching the building quietly. The camera pans up to reveal a sign that reads ‚ÄúMedical Center‚Äù.)

Austin: ‚ÄúSo we are here at the Lindy Boggs Medical Center. This place is known for all sorts of paranormal activity. Me and Cecil are currently working our way inside with the hopes of catching some ghosts on camera. Hopefully, we‚Äôll uncover the secrets of this mysterious place. We‚Äôll catch back up with y‚Äôall once we‚Äôre inside.‚Äù

(Austin stops walking.)

Austin: ‚ÄúOk, that should be good. Let‚Äôs find a way into the‚Ä¶‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(Camera cuts to black. The time in the corner now reads 10:55 p.m. A crunching sound is heard before a light illuminates a hallway on the inside of the medical center.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúWoah! This is so cool!‚Äù

(The camera turns to show Austin looking into the medical center through a broken window.)

Austin: ‚ÄúOk, once I hop through, we‚Äôll walk down the hall. Then we‚Äôll look around for weird creepy stuff to film.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúGotcha.‚Äù

(Austin jumped down into the building from the window. The camera panned, and they slowly made their way down the hallway.)

Austin: ‚ÄúAlright. We‚Äôve made it inside the building. As you can see this place is already super creepy. Let‚Äôs look around and see what we can find‚Ä¶ Ok. That‚Äôs good.‚Äù

(Camera cuts to the next scene.)

**Report Note**: Kamran was not present in this scene. Most likely, he waited outside until the shot was finished. Kamran does appear in later shots.

\--------------------------------------------------

(The next shot shows the camera shining over an old hospital room. Broken glass and litter cover the floor. The time reads 10:59 p.m.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to a close up shot of a small pile of broken glass and used needles. The time reads 11:00 p.m.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúGotta watch our step out here.‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(The next shot is another hospital room, this time with a destroyed bed frame in the middle of the room. The time reads 11:10 p.m. ¬†Austin‚Äôs voice can be heard behind the camera.)

Austin: ‚ÄúGod, this place is freaky.‚Äù

Cecil (somewhere further away): Guys! Come check this out!

\--------------------------------------------------

(Image cuts to a new room. Time reads 11:13 p.m. The room is still decrepit and old. However, the trash on the floor had all been pushed to the walls, leaving the middle of the floor relatively clear. There on the floor, a large red pentagram was marked.)

**Report** **Note**: Due to the low resolution of the camera, it is unclear if the mark is paint, chalk, or some other substance. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the symbol was here before the boys arrived at the location or if the boys made this symbol themselves for the video.

Austin: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so cool‚Ä¶ No, I don‚Äôt like that let me try-‚Äù

(Camera cuts.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(Camera reopens over the pentagram. Time reads 11:13 p.m.)

Austin: ‚ÄúWoah‚Ä¶ Nice find.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúWhat do you think it‚Äôs doing here?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúProbably people trying to summon ghosts or something.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this.‚Äù

(A sudden crashing sound is heard behind the camera. The camera shakes and turns to face the empty doorway.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Let‚Äôs go check it out.‚Äù

(The camera moves towards the doorway and turns to show Kamran.)

Austin: ‚ÄúPerfect! Good job, Kamran. Let‚Äôs look for a nice open spot for the next shot.‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to black. The time reads 11:22 p.m. Inaudible whispers and quiet hushes can be heard.)

Austin (whispering): ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear anything.‚Äù

Cecil (whispering): ‚ÄúHow? It literally sounded like someone threw something down the hall.‚Äù

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúIs there someone else in here? I thought you said our parents were lying about there being a bunch of people in here.‚Äù

Austin (whispering): They are. They only say that stuff about there being like murderers and pedos in here because they think the roof is gonna like collapse one day, and they don‚Äôt want us in here when it does. But that‚Äôs not gonna happen for like a hundred years.‚Äù

Cecil (whispering): ‚ÄúStick the camera out in the hallway and see if you see anything.‚Äù

(Camera moves out to the hallway. Outside streetlights provide minimal visibility at the end of the hall.)

**Report** **Note**: While the light visibility and camera quality are incredibly poor. A small amount of movement can be seen at the end of the hall just as the camera is moved out of the room. This is only barely visible on a larger television screen and was most likely not noticed by the boys on the small playback screen of the camcorder.

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to a shot of the hallway illuminated by a flashlight. The time reads 11:25 p.m. the boys‚Äô footsteps on broken glass can be heard.)

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúI think we should go.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúYou were the one that suggested this place. There‚Äôs no one here. Even if there was, there are like three of us. Nobody is gonna mess with us.‚Äù

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúBut what about the noises?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúYou saw the video. There was nothing there. This building‚Äôs old as shit, stuff creaks and fall all the time.‚Äù

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúThe camera didn‚Äôt show anything 'cause it‚Äôs dark. If someone was standing there, we wouldn‚Äôt have seen it.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúSo what? You want to go back and not finish the video? We‚Äôre here now already dude. I‚Äôm not going till we finish the video.‚Äù

Cecil (whispering): ‚ÄúOk, look. I say we stay and film, but let‚Äôs work quick and wrap things up. This will already be our best video.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúSure, yeah. That‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

(The camera and flashlight turn to illuminate a nearby hospital room with an old destroyed wheelchair inside.)

Kamran (whispering and sounding nervous): ‚ÄúYeah, ok. Let‚Äôs just make it quick.‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(Video cuts to the camera bobbing quickly down the hallway with Austin to the right of the screen. Time reads 11:30 p.m.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúAre you sure it‚Äôs this way?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, right down here.‚Äù

(A crash can be heard further down the hallway.)

Austin: ‚ÄúThat room! Go!‚Äù

(The camera bobs violently before quickly turning into the room. The camera pans over 3 of the four corners of the empty room.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs the ghost toying with us like this?‚Äù

(Brief pause.)

Austin: ‚ÄúCool. So, we‚Äôll-‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts and opens with the camera being propped up against something, along with the light. The room is much more open than the previous rooms in the footage. The rooms seem to be filled with pipes, wires, and toilets. A dark hallway with doors to patient rooms can be seen in the background. The time reads 11:42 p.m. All three boys are seen in the picture.)

Austin: ‚ÄúOk so I think this‚Äôll be perfect, but I need to check back at this shot to make sure everything‚Äôs in frame. So, you and I will be talking about what we saw and heard, Kamran will make some noise in that room over there, we‚Äôll go check it out, we step in, I shake the camera, and we scream. That will be the end of the video.‚Äù

**Report** **Note**: While talking, a faint movement can be seen at the edge of the doorway. It is too dark to tell what it could be.

Kamran (visibly nervous): ‚ÄúDo I have to go in there? Can‚Äôt I just throw something into the room?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúPeople will see the object going into the room. It has to be in a place where they can‚Äôt see.‚Äù

Kamran: ‚ÄúI really want to get out of here, Austin.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúOk! Then go in the room and make some noise.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúAustin, chill. It‚Äôs ok.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúNo! It‚Äôs the last thing, dude. Perfect finale. I don‚Äôt understand the big deal. Like I‚Äôll never ask you to do anything like this again, man. Just one little thing, and then we are out of here.‚Äù

Kamran: ‚ÄúOk, fine. You have like one take though, ok?‚Äù

Austin (putting hands in prayer motion): ‚ÄúThank you! It‚Äôs gonna be great!‚Äù

(Austin reaches for the camera before it the image cuts.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts back to the same position. This time, only Austin and Cecil are present in the frame. The time reads 11:47 p.m.)

Austin: ‚ÄúOk. Here we go‚Ä¶ Alright. All in all, I think this was a pretty good search of the facility.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúI agree. Hopefully, the audio turns out good and we‚Äôll be able to hear all the strange noises.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it will be fine. But I believe we might have uncovered something much more sinister with that pentagram on the ground. Perhaps someone is trying to keep the ghosts locked in here with some horrible spell.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs why the place has never been torn down despite the obvious health risk.‚Äù

Austin (looking agitated): ‚ÄúExactly. And to add to that‚Ä¶ what if‚Ä¶ Ok Kamran! You‚Äôre supposed to be making noise by now! Don‚Äôt give us two long to talk.‚Äù

(The two boys stare at the door in silence.)

Austin: ‚ÄúLook, I know you said one take, but since you messed this one up, we will do one more.‚Äù

(The two boys sit in silence again.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúKamran, you aren‚Äôt scaring us.‚Äù

(Austin grabs the camera and light and walks across the room to the door.)

Austin: ‚ÄúSeriously, dude! You were crying about wanting to leave, and now you are just-‚Äù

(The camera enters the room. In the back left corner of the hospital room is the figure of an emaciated man hunched over with his back turned to the camera. What little clothes he is wearing are tattered and in a state of disarray. His skin is incredibly pale, and his head is completely bald. His left hand is held over the mouth of the deceased body of Kamran Roth. The man‚Äôs head is craned over the boy‚Äôs neck, head bobbing in an animalistic chewing motion. The camera begins to shake.)

Austin (whispering): ‚ÄúHoly shit. Oh my god. Oh my god.‚Äù

(The man slowly turns his head, his ears abnormally large for his head. He has a scrunched small nose, his face covered in wrinkles, and a prominent thick brow ridge. His eyes reflected the light, giving them a glowing yellow appearance. The man slowly stands up and turns to face the two boys. His mouth and chin are covered in blood. It appears he was gnawing at Kamran‚Äôs neck. The man‚Äôs arms and fingers seem abnormally long. His stomach appears bloated. He stands with a hunch. The man appears older, but due to the man‚Äôs abnormal face and shape, I cannot confidently estimate his age.)

**Report** **Note**: Despite the thorough investigation of the Lindy Boggs Medical Center, no recent blood of the victims was found.

Cecil (yelling): ‚ÄúRun, Austin! Run!‚Äù

(The camera turns and shakes violently as the two boys run down the hallway. The footage is hard to make out due to low resolution and shaking, but you can see the boys twisting and turning down hallways for around three and a half minutes. The camera eventually steadies for a moment as it looks down the hallway with the broken window at the end that the boys used to enter the building.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúCome on! Come on! We got to get out of-‚Äù

(As Cecil nears the end of the hallway, the man steps out of a hospital room adjacent to Cecil‚Äôs left. The man grabs Cecil by the neck and lifts him into the air with one hand, pinning him against the wall.)

**Report** **Note**: After replaying and tracking the route the boys took and cross referencing it with the layout of the building, there is no way in my understanding that the man could have reached that room to ambush the boys before the boys reached the window. It would have required him to either run past the boys without the boys noticing or being picked up on the camera or crawl through the small ventilation shaft faster than two teenage boys could sprint a much shorter distance.

**Report** **Note**: Given this shot is both closer and gives Cecil as a reference point for size. I estimate the man must be at least 6‚Äô2‚Äù. The man appears to have thin white hair on the man‚Äôs arms and back. This further supports the man being older, however, he moves with a speed and strength that does not resemble his age.

(Cecil screams as the man holds him. The wrinkled skin on the man‚Äôs head stretches back for his mouth to open wider than what would appear possible. The man bites down on Cecil‚Äôs neck hard enough to cause Cecil‚Äôs neck to begin bleeding profusely. The man‚Äôs mouth appears to make a sucking motion. Austin turns and runs back down the hallway. He runs for about 45 seconds before sharply turning into a dark room. The camera is placed on something before Austin turns his flashlight off. Austin can be heard panting before breaking out into quiet sobs. This goes on for about 2 minutes before Austin suddenly stops. Footsteps can be heard coming down the hallway outside the room.)

(After a few moments, the sound of footsteps stops close to the camera. The camera picks up what appears to be the sound of sniffing. Austin begins to sob again.)

Austin (crying): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry sir‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll leave‚Ä¶ Please‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll leave, and I won‚Äôt tell anyone. I swear‚Ä¶ Please God‚Ä¶‚Äù

(The footsteps rush into the room, and the sounds of a struggle can be heard. The camera tips over and falls to the ground, facing the doorway. The silhouette of the man dragging Austin out of the room can be seen. Austin‚Äôs screams and inaudible pleads can be heard moving farther away from the camera for around 3 minutes before abruptly stopping.)

(The camera remains in the location without incident for the rest of the footage.)

\--------------------------------------------------

*End of transcript*

After finishing the tape, I immediately ran to my lieutenant and informed him that this was something he needed to see. I took him to the room and rewound the tape to the moment the gaunt man showed up. My lieutenant watched in both horror and amazement of the brutality of the man the boys captured on tape.

‚ÄúWe need to contact the FBI,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúClearly, we‚Äôre dealing with some kind of serial killer who cannibalizes his victims. But then there‚Äôs the trick with him getting in that room. I don‚Äôt have any idea how he could have made it there in time to ambush them like that. And his mouth‚Ä¶ what the hell was that?‚Äù

My lieutenant stood up and began walking out of the room.

‚ÄúI need you to remain here, detective. I‚Äôm going to make a few phone calls about this matter and then I‚Äôll tell you where we go from here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I replied.

I waited in the room for about 45 minutes before my lieutenant reentered the room, his face pale and eyes worried.

‚ÄúHow many people have seen this video?‚Äù he asked quietly as he took the tape out of the VHS player.

‚ÄúSo far? Just us, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù He said sternly. ‚ÄúListen to me closely, Bowman; For the time being, you are not allowed to talk about this tape or the contents in it to anyone. Understand?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I replied quickly

While I found his attitude was odd, it is normal for details on a case to be kept quiet while the case is being investigated or handed off to a larger agency. I filed the transcript away in my desk and was placed on a different New Orleans homicide case the next day. I figured I would soon be given more information about what happened with the case or see on the news that the FBI had found the guy. But as days turned to a week, and a week turned into four, I realized that I might not be receiving the closure I wanted on this case after all.

I came into the office early one morning. I scrolled through the daily emails from the children‚Äôs families asking for updates, wanting to know if we had found any sign of their boys. It hurt me to lie to them. To tell the terrified parents that we were doing everything we could to try and find their boys alive and well, knowing that it would never happen. I mindlessly opened my internet browser and typed in ‚ÄúSpookySplorers98 YouTube‚Äù and pressed enter‚Ä¶ No results found. Confused, I Googled the boys‚Äô names in hopes of finding a news report on them missing‚Ä¶ Nothing. I pulled out my phone and did the same, assuming that there was something wrong with my computer, but I was greeted with the same lack of results. I returned to my work computer and opened up our case file database. My stomach was beginning to tie itself into knots as I typed out the case file number into the search bar and pressed enter‚Ä¶ ‚Äú0 Results Found‚Äù. With the exception of the parents‚Äô emails, it was as though the boys‚Äô case never existed.

I stood up and made my way to my lieutenant‚Äôs office. Something was happening with the boys‚Äô case, and it felt wrong. I needed answers, and he would most likely have some insight into the matter. As I stepped into his office, my lieutenant glanced up from some papers he was reading before continuing the perusal of his paperwork.

‚ÄúDetective Bowman,‚Äù he said calmly, ‚Äúwhat can I do for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI need to talk to you about the missing children‚Äôs case from a few weeks ago.‚Äù

His eyes shot up from his paper, his brow furrowed at me.

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I continued, ‚Äúall mention of the case is gone. Not just from normal search engines, but from our database as well. It‚Äôs like the case didn‚Äôt ever exist.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were told not to talk about this matter.‚Äù he said firmly.

‚ÄúAnd I haven‚Äôt. But this is way bigger than just some missing persons case. Those children are dead, and I have no reassurance that anything is being done about it. Hell, the damn medical center has no additional barricades put up to keep people out. That‚Äôs an active crime scene, and any homeless person or drug addict can just walk in off the street and start tampering with evidence.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt get that reassurance from me, detective.‚Äù He spoke quietly but sharply. ‚ÄúAll I can tell you, and even this is pushing it, is that this case was sent way higher up than either of us expected. They told me that the situation was ‚Äòdelicate‚Äô and that going forward, the case is to be treated as though it didn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

My lieutenant was sweating now, nervous over the whole ordeal.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve already asked them, Bowman.‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI asked them if anything would be done, if the families could get some closure. They told me not to worry about what may or may not be done. But they told me that under no circumstances will the family know the details of what happened.‚Äù

I stepped back, taking in what my lieutenant had just said. He hung his head and spoke softly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Bowman. I really am‚Ä¶ I know this is bothering you. God knows it‚Äôs bothering me too. Take the day. Go for a walk. Clear your head about.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I whispered softly.

I turned and slowly walked to the door.

‚ÄúDetective,‚Äù my lieutenant spoke, ‚Äúyou did nothing wrong. These things happen sometimes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I replied.

I walked to my desk somberly. I slowly put small items into my purse, being sure to be inconspicuous as I took out the tape‚Äôs transcript from my desk and slipped the papers into my bag. After it was secured, I walked out of the building and went for a walk.

I don‚Äôt know what the importance is of the thing that killed those boys, but I refuse to live life on the idea that *maybe* someone else will do something about it. I refuse to let those parents go on for the rest of their lives wondering what happened to their children. I don‚Äôt know who said what to my lieutenant that made him so scared as to overlook the butchering of three children, but whatever it was, it wasn‚Äôt said to me.",1,1744401494.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1jwz0cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1jwz0cf/how_semen_retention_is_changing_me/,How semen retention is changing me.,"I‚Äôve always had a fear of rejection. I was so scared of putting myself out there. I never really asked women out, always waited for a woman to come to me. I always listened to fear and self doubt inside me and I let it control me, always wondering what if? Even not being happy with myself for not taking action and let that fear of rejection control my life and decisions I made.

Currently on 60 days of semen retention and there was a new coworker that just started at work. I wanted to ask her out for a coffee and lunch and ending up asking her out. She said she doesn‚Äôt want to mix personal life with professional/work life. Which I understood and accepted.

NOTE: I‚Äôm not on semen retention for woman attraction or picking up woman at all. I‚Äôm focused on becoming my best version and trying to achieve success outside of work when it comes to making an income. But I feel I used that as an excuse not talk to women. ‚ÄúI need money before I can do this.‚Äù ‚ÄúI need this before I do that.‚Äù ‚ÄúI need to look like this before I do this.‚Äù I‚Äôm not focused on women on this journey but if I see a girl I find attractive I don‚Äôt want to build in excuses for myself. Part of becoming my best version is breaking those barriers and overcoming fears.

It wasn‚Äôt a success but there‚Äôs success in it. Even though it was a no and will be a bit awkward. I am happy and proud of myself for overcoming that obstacle of fear. And I actually feel good after not listening to my self doubts and fear. Semen retention is giving me that pair of balls so to speak. I‚Äôm starting to not be scared of what other people think anymore, overcoming fears and obstacles that are stopping me from becoming my best version. I‚Äôm starting to understand myself and develop that confidence through this practice. Before practicing SR I would‚Äôve never had the courage to do that, even if I did it would‚Äôve put a huge dent in my self confidence. SR makes me grounded and unshakable. 

I view it also as a test from the universe/God. I‚Äôve been consuming all this content in forms of books and YouTube videos without applying all the things I know I need to do. I won‚Äôt give up this practice as I know this is shaping me into becoming the best version of myself. ",5,1744401413.0,Semenretention,0,1.0,False

So as the title says, I am a Canadian student with a previous degree in criminology now studying law in the UK. I have one more year (of 2) left of my studies. I previously applied to firms for a VC but was denied. Being honest, I didn't do that much research so that's on me.

I have been able to work in my Uni's legal clinic, been hand picked to attend legal events or hold a student role in pro bono committee's. I have also have a bunch of coffee chats with lawyers at firms I am interested in and they have so far all agreed to help with my application forms for the next cycle.

I feel like I have the experience a firm would like, both professional and legal, my big concern is how to answer those VC/TC questions on the application. I know I have to cater to each firm and research and thats totally fine. I am just worried that if I don't secure a TC I have to go back home to Canada and I really want to have a life in the UK.

If anyone has recently done the applications and was successful I would really appreciate any advice on how to approach those questions! Many thanks!",1,1744401312.0,uklaw,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm going to meet with my ex for coffee in a couple of days and I‚Äôm freaking out (me 28F, her 26F). I got dumped by her, and definitely want to get back together but I doubt she wants the same thing. The breakup has been incredibly painful for both of us I think, and we had an agreement with s couple‚Äôs therapist that we would take a 3 month separation and then meet and decide if we wanna part ways for good, or give it another shot. We also agreed not to see other people during this time period and now that our time is up, the thought of me or her dating anyone else still hurts like hell. I definitely still love her and I‚Äôm sure she loves me too. The breakup didn‚Äôt happen because of lack of love, she simply gave up on the relationship and was facing some serious struggles mentally (I was too) and she wasn‚Äôt strong enough to keep it going. We both made mistakes in the relationship but nothing unsalvageable. I am very worried about her as I don‚Äôt think she is doing good and all I want is to be there for her‚Ä¶ I would do anything, anything to be back in her life and support her. 

So my question is‚Ä¶ how do I act in the meeting so she is more likely to consider us getting back together? I know I have to stay ‚Äúcool‚Äù and not beg for her back. I‚Äôm not planning on doing that (I am gonna look hot though;)) but I do really want her back. 
Please be kind and don‚Äôt just say stuff like ‚Äúget over it‚Äù. It‚Äôs been well over 3 months and my feelings have not only stayed the same, they didn‚Äôt even shift a tiny bit. I know it‚Äôs not enough time to heal from almost a 3 year relationship.

1jwyvya,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnBHosts/comments/1jwyvya/guest_airbnb_account_deleted_during_stay_airbnb/,Guest Airbnb account deleted during stay; Airbnb did not inform me as the host,"TLDR: Single male guest left basement Airbnb suite in a horrible state. Airbnb kicked him off the platform with 3 days left in his stay. However, I was not informed and I lost the ability to communicate with him via the app. I feel Airbnb put our safety at risk. Would I be entitled to ask for some compensation?

We operate an Airbnb out of the basement of our home. I had a single male guest book a stay from April 1-6. He checked in as expected on the 1st. I received the payout on April 2nd. On April 2nd I sent him a message to check in on how things were going and to remind him that he could contact us any time. On April 5, he received the automatic message 24 hrs ahead of check-out to remind him of the check-out time, etc. I noted that neither of the messages had been 'read' on the Airbnb app.

On April 6 at 11 am, my husband looked in and he said ""there's shit everywhere"" and it was clear the guest was still there. My husband knocked on the door and clearly woke the guest up. My husband had to tell him that it was past check-out time and he needed to leave. We gave him about an hour to get out. My husband described him as appearing ""strung out"".

The suite was in the worst state I have ever found it in almost 4 years of hosting. He hadn't used a single garbage bin or the fridge - instead, partially eaten food and drink and garbage were spread all over the apartment. There were probably 10 or 12 McDonalds/A&W take-out bags everywhere, with partially eaten burgers and fries everywhere. There were open, partially consumed bottles of Coke and coffee in different places. There were open sauce packages everywhere, including on the carpeted bedroom floor. There were also hundreds of dollars worth of sports betting receipts spread all over. \[Edit: The photos capture some of the mess, but tbh, it was so gross that I didn't really even want to get a good look at the half-eaten food, let alone take photos of it.\]

At 2:00 pm when I got the ability to write a review, I got an error suggesting that I was using the wrong account to try to write the review. I only have one Airbnb account, so I knew this was an error. I called Airbnb and they said the reason I was unable to write the review was because Airbnb had cancelled the guest's account. I asked when they had done it and the agent said it was on April 3rd.

So the reason he had not received any of my messages is that he had been kicked off the platform. However, I was not informed, so he was allowed to stay for three more days in my home and I had no authorized way of contacting him. I feel this put us at a huge safety risk since the suite is in our home. I also suspect that this also voided any ability we would have to recoup costs if he had caused damage or stolen anything from our unit. I wonder if it also voided any insurance coverage we get as hosts if he had injured himself on our property.

I want some kind of compensation but I'm not even sure what to ask for! I just feel upset and unsettled by the whole situation.

I'm chubby, I do got my curves and honestly , not the best looking girl out there, but I know how to love and care about someone.

I started to think about going to the gym lately (but my doctor stopped me since i have a tumor in my knee, so walks for now), so, I bought these leggins and PERSONALLY, I DIDN'T KNOW I COULD HAVE A BIGGER BUTT!! I SWEAR! üò≠

Still, my boyfriend saw me wearing it and he said ""you're not going out wearing that,right?"", I was about to go for a coffee and then, a happy stroll in the woods near his house...

I then asked him ""why not?"" And he said ""you're not like those girls (he didn't said girls but yes another word,but I'll avoid conflict in the comments) on IG, that show their body molded in those leggings"" and I said ""but your friends are the type to put a like on the picture/video without complaining""  And he said ""you'll get the attention, like the IG women, but you use to complain about the comments you got when you leave the house, but hey, don't come to me crying when a man stares and makes an assault comment about it"". 

I felt bad, really bad, eventually, I stopped wearing those leggings, so I bought a pack, like a jacket, top and jeans too, but not molding my body, but once I put it on... It did, now, I didn't know it would, I tried to explain to him but he once again asked ""are you going to leave like that?""

I kept denying with fear he would leave, but my best friend says ""girl, go out however you want"" .

It's not a surprise he never back me up, especially when there was a time, an old man around 70s made jokes that made me uncomfortable, not so close to assault but enough to make me shiver, and still, he defended that man calling me crazy and insane...

**Cold Open + Segment 1**

*FADE IN:*

### **INT. AFTERWORDS SET ‚Äì NIGHT FOREVER**

A velvet-curtained stage. Midnight blue. A faux fireplace flickers with cold plasma. A chrome desk sits center, cluttered with mismatched mugs, eternal hourglasses, and a broken tambourine.  

THE HOST leans into the camera, expression unreadable but eyes buzzing like a tuning fork held to a cathedral bell.

A mug steams in front of them. Label reads: ‚Äú*AC > DC*‚Äù in glitter Sharpie.

**THE HOST (into camera)**  
There are men who are born in the wrong century. And then there are men who come so early they make the rest of the century feel late.

Nikola Tesla. The electric Messiah. Patron saint of forgotten blueprints. Visionary. Recluse. Bird lover. And‚Äîif you ask the internet‚Äîprobably an alien.

But it‚Äôs hard to be a god when everyone wants you to build a lightbulb. Harder still when your rival builds a better PR team.

(Sips.)

Tonight, we honor the man who dreamed of illuminating the world for free... and died arguing with hotel clerks over pigeon privileges.

(Camera slowly dollies out.)

He‚Äôs waited long enough.

---

### **SFX: ELECTRICAL WHINE BUILDING**  
The lights stutter. Sparks crawl across the floor like sentient static.

Then‚Äî  
**FLASH!**  
Tesla appears center stage in a burst of blue arc light. He‚Äôs tall, elegant, and vibrating faintly with cosmic irritation. Wearing a crumpled three-piece suit, one shoe untied, a pencil tucked behind his ear.

He‚Äôs holding a napkin scrawled with equations and muttering to himself.

**TESLA**  
‚ÄîNo, no, the resonance is *off*. If you invert the phasing loop through the orbital plane‚Äî*of course* it would synchronize. They couldn‚Äôt see it, the fools. The coil *sings*, and they gave it a muzzle. They *paid* Edison to gag the music of the future!

(He notices the Host.)

Who are you? What‚Äôs your clearance level?

**HOST**  
Welcome to *Afterwords*, Mr. Tesla. You‚Äôre‚Äî  
(Glances at clipboard.)  
‚Äîslightly late. Though to be fair, so was your Nobel Prize.

**TESLA (frowns)**  
Am I dreaming? Or is this a poorly funded symposium?

**HOST**  
Little of column A, lot of column B, with a sprinkling of cosmic bureaucracy. You‚Äôre dead. You‚Äôre here. This is your last interview before the metaphysical curtain call.

(Beat.)  
And we *are* rolling.

**TESLA**  
Dead? Hmph. I‚Äôve died before. When Edison won the Medal of Honor. When Westinghouse sold out. When the pigeons stopped coming.

**HOST**  
Not to be rude, but‚Äîare you always this dramatic, or is it the lightning residue?

**TESLA**  
Electricity is a mood. You don‚Äôt build dynamos unless your soul is already rotating on a copper axis.

(The Host‚Äôs desk lamp flares.)

**HOST**  
Great. The interns are gonna love that. You just shorted out our fridge.

---

### **SEGMENT 1 ‚Äì ‚ÄúI Invented the Future and All I Got Was This Lousy Obituary‚Äù**

The Host gestures. A projector screen descends behind them.

An obituary appears, dated 1943. Dry. Clinical. Mentions a hotel. Mentions ‚Äúeccentricities.‚Äù Ends with *‚Äúsurvived by no immediate family.‚Äù*

Tesla glares at it like it‚Äôs a failed experiment.

**TESLA**  
They made me a footnote. I gave them radio, robotics, remote control. Dreams in alternating current. And they bury me under the heading of ‚Äòquirky foreigner with delusions of death beams.‚Äô

**HOST**  
You did have a death beam.

**TESLA**  
It was a *peace ray*. Words matter.

(Beat. Tesla‚Äôs expression softens briefly.)

They didn‚Äôt understand. I did not want fame. I wanted resonance. Harmony. To leave the world humming.

**HOST**  
And instead you left it... a little haunted?

(A plasma orb rolls in from the side. Tesla glances down and it *levitates slightly.*)

**TESLA (quietly)**  
I suppose every inventor becomes a ghost in the end. Especially the ones whose wires are left dangling.

**HOST (gently)**  
Is that what you‚Äôre here to do? Finish the wiring?

(Tesla pauses, caught between ego and grief.)

**TESLA**  
No. That would require patience. I burned that away sometime in 1901.

(Beat.)

But if I could just fix the frequency‚Äîif I could align the coils‚Äîit would all make sense again.

**SFX: INTERCOM BUZZ**

**PRODUCER (O.S.)**  
Host, we‚Äôre getting EM feedback in the craft services table. Also: do *not* let him plug anything in. Last time we had this much interference, Voltaire came back for 30 seconds and tried to unionize the ghosts.

**TESLA**  
I *like* Voltaire. He understood the satire of existence.

**HOST**  
He also tried to seduce the teleprompter.

---

**TESLA**  
Ah! The machine speaks!  

**HOST**  
That's just the Producer. He *thinks* he's in charge. Please don't argue with him. He has control of the coffee metaphors.

**PRODUCER (O.S.)**  
I *am* the coffee metaphor.

(Tesla nods, entirely unfazed.)

**TESLA**  
Of course. That tracks.

**HOST**
Hold that thought. We'll be right back.

### **INT. AFTERWORDS SET ‚Äì CONTINUOUS**

**HOST**
Welcome back. We have with us ‚Äî*the* Nikola Tesla...

The Host taps a cue card against their palm. Tesla is mid-rant, using invisible props to demonstrate an electromagnetic field.

**TESLA**  
‚ÄîI told J.P. Morgan, ""Let me electrify the planet. We can beam power through the air. No wires. No limits."" And what did he say?

**HOST**  
(Looking at card.)  
‚ÄúIf I can‚Äôt put a meter on it, I‚Äôm not interested.‚Äù

**TESLA**  
Exactly! *They wanted cages. I wanted sky!*

**HOST**  
You wanted to give away energy. They wanted to charge monthly.

**TESLA**  
They wanted to *own* the lightning. But you cannot patent the storm.

---

### **SFX: FEEDBACK WHINE**

A spotlight swings across the stage. A spectral figure flickers into view in the back row of the phantom studio audience.

He‚Äôs short. Smug. Wearing an old-timey suit with the smugness starched in. Holding a glowing incandescent bulb like a trophy.

**THE HOST (groaning)**  
Oh no. Not him.

**TESLA (squinting)**  
...Edison?

**EDISON (ghostly, smug)**  
‚ÄòEllo, Nicky.

**TESLA (instantly bristling)**  
You‚Äôre not invited.

**EDISON (floating closer)**  
Just came to see the *show.* Thought I‚Äôd drop in, see how you spin the story. You always were good at drama. Not so great with profit margins.

**HOST**  
(Whispering, dry)  
We don‚Äôt usually do hauntings this early, but apparently he *wouldn't* wait his turn.

**EDISON**  
That‚Äôs right. Because I *win.* I *showed up.* I wired cities while you played with lightning like it was poetry.

**TESLA**  
I invented the radio.

**EDISON**  
Yeah, but I *sold* it.

Do I *have* to speak with him?

**HOST**  
Technically? No. But metaphysically? Apparently yes. The producers say unresolved grudges count as ‚Äúunfinished soulwork.‚Äù

**PRODUCER (O.S.)**  
And also we‚Äôre farming this beef for ratings. It‚Äôs testing *very* well with the ghost of Steve Jobs.

Look, you were brilliant. I‚Äôll give you that. But nobody understood what you were *doing.* You were fifteen inventions ahead and five decades behind.

You didn‚Äôt have to steal my patents.

The Host glances at the pigeon. The lights dim. The temperature drops‚Äînot with cold, but clarity.

**HOST (gently)**  
This her?

**TESLA (nods)**  
She used to visit me in my room. She was the only thing I ever truly loved. Not romantically. Just‚Äîutterly. Purely. I told people she was a messenger. They laughed.

(Beat.)  
But she *was*.

**HOST**  
A message from who?

**TESLA**  
From the silence between the stars.

### **FLASHBACK SKIT ‚Äì ‚ÄúPigeon Interlude‚Äù**  
**STYLE: 1920s silent film meets modern sketch comedy.**

Black and white. Piano music. Tesla in a hotel room, feeding a pigeon seed. He speaks in title cards:

> *""She told me I would not die until I finished my final invention.""*

> *""And when she glowed with light from her eyes‚ÄîI knew it was done.""*

Cut to a hotel manager knocking. Tesla screams about vibrations and door hinges.

### **BACK TO STUDIO**

The pigeon hops once, then takes flight‚Äîglowing faintly, wingbeats trailing sparks.

**HOST**  
She always show up when it‚Äôs time?

**TESLA (nods)**  
She came the night before I died.

**HOST**  
And now?

**TESLA**  
She‚Äôs come to tell me I can go.

**EDISON**  
Ugh, is it always pigeons with you?

**HOST**  
(Eying the intercom)  
Can we *unmanifest* Edison?

**PRODUCER (O.S.)**  
Done.

**SFX: EDISON ZAPPED OUT OF EXISTENCE.**

**TESLA (calmer now)**  
Thank you.

**HOST**  
For what?

**TESLA**  
For letting me remember. For letting me matter without having to *market.*

### **SFX: THE STAGE BEGINS TO DISSOLVE**

The background warps‚Äîturning into a field of stars shaped like circuitry. The Host stands.

**HOST (to camera)**  
We remember the noise‚Äîthe headlines, the losses, the brilliance buried under failed investments. But maybe legacy isn‚Äôt the story others tell about you. Maybe it‚Äôs the one you leave behind... *before* they rewrite it.

(Turns to Tesla.)  
You ready?

**TESLA (smiling)**  
I've always been ready. I was just waiting for the world to catch up.

(He walks offstage. The lights dim.)

This week, my ex and I decided that we should part ways after our three year relationship. We lived together, which meant we had to figure out our living situations. She found a place that had cheaper rent, and I‚Äôd finish the lease on the apartment we both started together. I also made it clear that I would help her financially up until June so I can have peace of mind knowing that she‚Äôd be okay financially, and I even let her take majority of everything within the apartment we lived in together (coffee maker, the TV, even our cat that I loved very much). 

However, three days later, when I came back to the apartment to discuss what was happening with her (I went to my parents house for a bit after the breakup for some space and time to mourn), she straight up admits to me that she‚Äôs already on dating apps, and has a date with a guy already lined up for this upcoming Tuesday. Now I find myself wanting absolutely nothing to do with her, and I don‚Äôt want to help her financially anymore because it destroyed me on the inside, and there‚Äôs something humiliating about giving a woman money while she‚Äôs out with other men. She tried justifying it by telling me it‚Äôs her way of coping, and that I should‚Äôve expected this because she did this with her last boyfriend with me. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm still grieving over the end of our relationship and probably will be for a while. Did the three years together mean nothing?

We think she is about 1. She has settled into a routine nicely. She sleeps all day and is most active around 6-7am, she then wraps herself in our guest bed blankets and sleeps. around 4pm she window sits and then might play with us until she eats at 6 then she window sits again. When we go to bed she plays by herself and gets major zoomies up and down our stairs.  She meows at us through our door at 6am and once she has seen we are alive she patrols the windows again until we get up for coffee then she says hi and wants a few pets before she puts herself down for the day. 

So my questions is... if we are gone from a thursday morning early to a monday mid afternoon do I need to get cat sitter to come twice a day or would one 45 min visit work in the afternoon/evening hoping she plays and can get some treats, pets, and wet food. The sitter would of course clean her box and refresh her water. 

She is very shy around new people and will not really come out of hiding unless someone is here for hours and hours and she will poke her head around a corner and just observe then she bolts back to her room. (our guest room she has decided is hers lol). I say this because im not sure if one visit is perfect for a cat like her and if two visits in a day from a stranger would make her more stressed out.

1jwyhw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1jwyhw3/should_i_look_into_a_possible_diagnosis_for_mcas/,Should I look into a possible diagnosis for MCAS? I am desperate,"In this post we will talk about many things including sex and vomiting, if u do not feel comfortable with these topics pls do not go ahead.

Hello everyone, yesterday I wrote a post in the Allergies community about some strange reaction I was having after eating certain foods, and the comments were advices to research deeper into MCAS. 

Since I am desperate because whatever is going on in my body is ruining my life, this post is about all the symptoms I have ever had in the hopes any of you might have some idea about what is going on + if it is really worth to bring up MCAS to my doctors (none of them ever discussed it, found out about this condition yesterday thanks to the Allergies community) and start the lengthy process to possibly get it diagnosed.

So, around 4 years ago (December 2021) I had Covid-19 and I never fully recovered from it.
While I was positive I started to have some symptoms I have never had before in my life and they simply decided to never go away. 
It took me 2 weeks to get negative and one full month to get rid of the fever.

Here is the list:

Symptoms I always had but got worse after Covid:
1) Shaky hands 
2) Brittle nails
3) I was always the kind of person that would get a fever when becoming too tired but now the situation is out of control. First of all, it is not just a small fever (ex. 37.1-37.5) it is way higher (ex. 38+). Second, before I had to wear myself to exhaustion to get that fever (Before having Covid I was working 2 full time jobs + had an active social life and I still would not get a fever majority of the time), now if I just dare to go to classes every day for a week I get the fever. Third, lowering my fever / recovering from it now take way longer (before I just needed a 12 hours sleep, now it does not go away even with medicines).

Symptoms that appeared after having covid:
1) Chapped lips during every season even if I apply chapstick multiple times a day (they are also very prone to bleeding)
2) Low blood pressure (usually in the range 60-65/90-95, but sometimes it just randomly drop lower), this is particularly strange because I used to have tachycardia before covid
3) Severe headaches (especially tension headaches) 
4) Light sensitivity, I have blue eyes so I was always a little sensitive but now I need to wear sunglasses even in winter or my headaches will get worse
5) Noise sensitivity, used to go clubbing every chance I had, now if one of my university professors speaks too loudly I need to leave the classroom because I would flinch all the time / develop an even worse headache / my ears will start ringing 
6) In general my ears will start ringing at random times, this is a relative new symptom so I only managed to connect it with ppl speaking loudly around me, but sometimes it also happen when I am alone in my room
7) I went from having a fully regular period to having amenorrhea + before I would just be slightly more tired during that time of the month, after Covid I could not even stand up for more than half an hour without feeling the need to vomits / get terrible headaches / having hot flushes.
My period became so heavy I had to change my pad nearly every hour and I would have vertigoes constantly.
I partially solved this problem now because my gynaecologist prescribed me a pill that act as a contraceptive but also completely stop my period, I have not had one in the last three years. But this did not solve the problem, it just postponed it
8) Numbness both in the legs and in the arms at all times
9) Constant muscle pain
10) Constant back pain (I have scoliosis but the doctor I saw for the back pain told me it is not that prominent and it should not cause me this much pain)
11) I don‚Äôt tolerate neither hot nor cold weather anymore, especially the cold. I am constantly cold at all times (and it is such a strange sensation like I am freezing from the inside idk how to explain). The few times I am not cold I have hot flashes, stoped having them during my period (because I do not have a period anymore) and overtime I just started having them at random time, the only trigger I have noticed for now is the sun, but I also get them at night sometimes, so idk if it is accurate. 
Going back to the sun, before Covid I loved taking long walk on the beach even at 2pm, now I can not even walk on a street at 8am under direct sunlight or I will have hot flashes for the rest of the day. This is also a relatively new symptoms, I am so scared it will get worse especially with the summer coming.
Of course after the hot flash I get the worst freezing sensation possible.
12) I always used to sweat a lot, but lately it is becoming even worse. Especially because the smell of the sweat got worse as well. Now I have to keep a change of clothes on me at all times and need to stop in a bathroom to wash up constantly. Everything I have tried does not work, I use three different types of deodorant + perfumes and still, after I sweat even a little, I smell.
13) Since we are talking about going to the bathroom, I now have to pee constantly. And by ‚Äúconstantly‚Äù I mean ‚ÄúI have to plan my life around having to go the bathroom at least once every hour‚Äù. And even after I go I have the sensation that I need to urinate again. 
14) My eyes and mouth feel incredibly dry at all times but I am not dehydrated, only drinking a lot seems to help a little but that only makes point 13 worse, so I can drink that much only when I am at home all day.
15) If I try to engage in any sexual relation the pain is so bad I start crying + asa I stop everything down there start burning so bad and the pain persists for a few days after it. I literally broke up with my ex over this (that was for the best, he was a piece of sh1t) because I need to have at least 3/4 days in between intercourse or the pain will become so unbearable I cannot even stay in a seated position. Also If I have too many intercourse close to each other the bacteria in my urines get incredibly high and I would start having troubles peeing.
16) From time to time I wake up with swollen face and lips / puffy watery eyes (I was able to connect this to specific foods, specifically bell pepper and pineapple, but other times it just happen and I have no idea what ‚Äúactive‚Äù it).
17) I had random allergic reactions, my throat would start to close (making breathing very difficult) + hot flashes. I went to do a skin prick test, everything came back negative, and the doctors dismissed everything as ‚Äúintolerances‚Äù especially because I did not have rashes (they told me u need to have rashes during an allergic reaction). However few months ago I had another allergic reaction (to amoxicillin probably ) and this time I did have a rash that got so bad I could not sleep at night. This time I did go to the ER and got blood tests done which proved I had an active allergic reactions going on in my body. 
I went to do IgE tests specifics for medicines later on, but they came back all negative again (also the one for penicillin was negative). 
To conclude this part, now that it is spring I am starting to show symptoms related to pollen allergies, but once again, the prick test for pollen was negative.
18) I have lots of problems concentrating, during high school I had some of the highest grade in my school and could study for 8 continuous hours (after 6 hours of classes) with no problems. Now I am in University and I have trouble staying focused in a two hours class, let alone study.
19) I randomly forget stuff all the time, I was always bad at remembering names and dates like birthdays but now is even worse. I even forgot my step dad‚Äôs birthday which is something it would have never happened before. Also sometimes I just stop and randomly forget what I was doing or saying which is such a strange sensation, I just dissociate at random. Sometimes I also forget what I have said, or what I have been told, just a few minutes after it happened.
20) I have also noticed that now I have problems speaking / reading out loud, I just randomly forget the proper way to conjugate verbs, how some words are pronounced and the way sentences are built. And while it is true that my mother tongue is Italian and lately I have found myself having to use English a lot, this stuff is only getting worse not better. If u need to constantly switch in between two languages u should get better at doing it not worse, right? This problem is also starting to appear while I write, if I do not have help from phones/computers I make so many stupid grammar mistakes.
21) I dissociate more and more at random time, sometimes I will just start walking down a street I was not suppose to take and I am making stupid mistakes while driving my car or scooter (I am now driving less and less because of this, I am so scared I will just randomly dissociate and make a mistake that would lead to injuries to myself and other around me).
22) I have problems falling asleep (it takes me hours) but also problems waking up in the morning, I usually only manage to do it when I need to urinate so bad everything start to burn. Sometimes I also wake up in the middle of the night because I need to go to the bathroom.
23) If I forget my scarf one single day I will 100% develop a cough and it will take me MONTHS to recover from it.
24) Asa November comes around my rhinitis will flare up and stay with me for the rest of the winter, the only thing that helps me a little is nose spray with cortisone. This usually culminates in December when my fever just flares up (around 40) and will stay with me for a month at least no matter what I do or what medicines I take. I had to live with this for the last three winters.
25) I have vertigoes at all times, they are so bad I cannot switch from a seated position to a standing one without grabbing objects around me for help with stability. Otherwise the vertigoes get so bad I would just fell on the ground. This is particularly bad when I try to do it fast, of course.
26) I now get extremely anxious at the prospect of doing random daily activities (ex. catching a train, speaking with the barista while ordering coffee, answering my friends messages‚Ä¶)
27) I get tired doing everything, sometimes I wake up already feeling incredibly tired. Of course the tiredness just get worse during the day and with it also all the other symptoms, light/rumor sensitivity, headaches, vertigo‚Ä¶
28) I read that usually MCAS correlates with stomach issues, and I have had some of those over the years but they are not that bad compared to the other stuff. Sometimes I just get diarrhoea out of the blue (but it usually stop in a few days) and other times I randomly get a sensation like ‚ÄúI want to vomit‚Äù while I am eating.
The worse instance of this was when one night I randomly woke up in the night and had to run to the bathroom and vomited all my dinner, but I was fine after a few days.
30) The last two times I did blood test my lymphocytes were slightly higher than what they should have been.

I did other exams that show some anomaly, especially my echocolordoppler and my electrocardiogram, but my doctor did not seemed worried. He has yet to book an appointment to the cardiologist for me. (In Italy u need your doctor to make appointments to specialists or u will pay a lots of money, money I do not have now).

I conclude by apologising for two things. First, the length of this post, I really needed to vent about this situation, no one believes me anymore and they all dismiss it as being ‚Äúa little depressed‚Äù. By the way, I did went to see a psychologist, I am very much not depressed. Very tired about the situation, yes, traumatised because of my terrible childhood, also yes, but I am not depressed.

Basically, you add just enough hot water to barely cover or wet the grounds for about 30 seconds so they can release the carbon dioxide before pouring in the rest of the hot water for the actual brew. Said the release of CO2 helps give the coffee a smoother flavor. I believe she said it's also a good idea to do this for cocoa powder for flavor extraction but I can't remember.

Ah, Addis Ababa at night! A magical place where the streets come alive and the sound of laughter mixes with the aroma of freshly roasted coffee. If you thought your 9 PM bedtime was sacred, think again! 

Picture this: you step out of your hotel, and it‚Äôs like entering a vibrant festival. 

Fancy a nightcap? Forget the cocktail bars; instead, head to a local tej house. You‚Äôll find honey wine that‚Äôs smoother than your best pick-up line. Just be prepared for the inevitable ‚ÄúOne more round?‚Äù that leads to an impromptu sing-along of traditional songs‚Äîtrust me, the locals will love your off-key rendition!

And let‚Äôs not forget the nightlife‚Äôs unofficial mascot: the friendly street cat that seems to know all the best hangout spots. Follow it, and you might just discover a hidden gem or a late-night caf√© where everyone knows your name‚Ä¶ or at least your coffee order!

So, if you‚Äôre looking for a night out that‚Äôs equal parts adventure and comedy, Addis Ababa is your playground. Just remember to pace yourself; those coffee refills are no joke!

**TL;DR:**  
Recently diagnosed ADHD-C at 35. Gifted kid, lots of masking and overcompensating. Did ‚Äúfine‚Äù for years by relying on structure, deadlines, and praise, but now I WFH in a flexible job, and my systems are breaking down. I still look average or high functioning, but the internal chaos is real.

\---

I‚Äôm 35, recently diagnosed as ADHD-C and wanted to see if anyone here relates to this particular flavor of it. I was labeled gifted, have a 139 IQ (I know this is a problematic measure), good memory, strong verbal skills, all things that made it easy to coast for a long time, and also really hard to see what was actually going on.

As a kid/teen/college student, I didn‚Äôt struggle in the classic ways. I didn‚Äôt bounce off the walls or forget all my homework. But I did:

* do my homework while in class instead of listening to the teacher teach it, so i wouldn't have to do it later
* procrastinate any longer term projects until the absolute last minute
* drop or fail classes that got hard instead of pushing through
* change majors and transfer colleges multiple times, eventually taking 7y to get a bachelors

In my 20s I had a few different part time jobs that were flexible and easy to balance, and always had check ins/regular deadlines/social pressure to complete the work on time, so I did fine. Maybe I was seeking that out after the chaos of college? I think you could consider me ""underemployed"" for that time period, I ""could have"" been doing more with my brain - challenged more, trying to earn more, more creativity/collaboration, etc.

At 32 I got a software engineer job that I did and still do love. The first 1-2 years I had a fair amount of imposter syndrome and everything felt so new that I was always able to get my work done, except a few tough projects that I recall procrastinating on a fair bit. Now at year 3.5 I feel more like I've earned my stripes, so some of the imagined social pressure is gone, and I'm struggling more:

* I spend about 2 full WFH workdays a week just mentally begging myself to start working, and instead find anything else to do - chores, reddit, planning my garden, researching adhd...
* I spend about 1.5 of the 2 in-office days a week feeling very internally chaotic and not getting much done either, too many transitions into and out of commute, collab meetings, walking to next building to get coffee/lunch with team, etc. it's very overstimulating and not good at all for high-focus work like coding
* I don't fidget or get out of my seat, but my brain is going 500mph all the time. I rarely pay attention in meetings because I guess I'm smart enough to hear parts of it and fill in the gaps.
* I do [BFRBs](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/body-focused-repetitive-behavior-bfrb) like endlessly biting my cheek, especially when understimulated like during a meeting or sometimes when working on a tough problem - my psy says this is how fidgeting can look in adhd women
* we have a team demo every 2 weeks to show off what we worked on. I almost always do all of my work in the 24-48h before the demo, going into overdrive/hyperfocus and working late to catch back up. All the while really enjoying the work and berating myself for not just starting on it sooner and keeping normal hours!
* I tend to fixate on the demo itself, creating extra nice visuals and rehearsing more than is really necessary, finding unique creative ways to explain the problem and the solution - and then I always get great kudos => ""i've earned it"" => slack off again for the next 1.75 weeks

In personal life I struggle a bit to assess how much ADHD is really showing up:

* I ""never"" forget appointments/todos, but it's because I have a system where everything immediately goes in the calendar, with 4 alarms to remind me the week/day/hour/minute of
* and if I need to bring something somewhere, I hook my car keys to it. I have a hard time envisioning a NT or any person just spontaneously ""remembering"" everything they have to do in this modern age, is that real?
* I struggle to stick to even 5 pushups a day or to go outside (!) even though I'm increasingly worried about how little cardio I get as I get older. But doesn't everyone hate to exercise?
* same for diet - I know how calories work, I make a reasonable balanced plan but stick to it for about 2 days, then I go back to eating impulsively whenever I'm even slightly challenged by work
* I zone out sometimes when I'm not super interested in the topic, but isn't this normal? (husband's work stories, other peoples' hobbies etc?)
* I hyperfocus on creative projects in a big way, often spending multiple 10h days in a row writing short stories, building video games, or writing songs. But my completion rate is abysmal, I keep cycling between projects instead of sticking to one and finishing.
* but I can also totally pull things off too, like baking/cooking complex multi day things when having guests over (social pressure).
* my house and desk are usually really tidy, but it's because visual clutter = mental clutter for me, so I really need it that way to function. However to actually deep clean I really have to gear myself up, sometimes for a month at a time procrastinating it, and then once I start I can't stop until EVERYTHING is clean, even stuff I didn't plan on like the blinds or windows.
* I thought I had anxiety for years because of my overactive brain, but when I examine the actual thoughts, they are mostly about upcoming tasks that I'm dreading, nothing existential or internal (unless beating myself up for not doing the task I'm procrastinating)
* on that note, I tend to dread having to do anything at all, even things that I enjoy. Having a 3pm social engagement on the calendar on a Saturday will have me ruminating on it all day, like I can't truly relax until after I get back from that.

I mean, I could go on and on. But yeah, to summarize, I think the: gifted kid/successful career switcher, early promotion, clean house, doesn't drop the ball; is at odds with the: internal chaos, high effort to pull it all off, failure to follow through on tasks without audiences. Is anyone else in this boat? Do you doubt your diagnosis or feel like others don‚Äôt believe you because you ""seem fine"" on the outside? How has it shown up throughout your life?

### **Episode:** *The Paper Chase*  

---

**Opening Scene:**

*Trey walks into The Beacon newsroom late morning, coffee in hand, eyes half-lidded behind his glasses. Phones are ringing, journalists are bickering, and someone‚Äôs stress-eating a donut in the copy room. Bethesda‚Äôs version of a newsroom hurricane.*

**Trey (voiceover):**  
""Ah, the Beacon. A temple of journalism, chaos, and the kind of unspoken HR violations that keep corporate lawyers up at night. I come here to drop off film and drink mediocre coffee. But today? Today‚Äôs a different animal.""

*Camera cuts to the main floor. Three women orbit the newsroom with magnetic presence, each drawing a different kind of chaos into her wake. Trey eyes them one by one.*

---

**Enter:**

1. **Camille Lin** ‚Äì *Investigative reporter, sharp eyes, sharper wit, and a wardrobe that says ‚Äúpower suit, but make it dangerous.‚Äù*

2. **Paloma V√©lez** ‚Äì *Photo editor, messy bun, ink-stained fingers, always barefoot at her desk. Ethereal and unpredictable, the newsroom‚Äôs manic pixie chaos agent.*

3. **Dr. Rhea Nomura** ‚Äì *Science & tech columnist, PhD in molecular engineering, part-time podcast host, full-time disarmer of fragile egos. Ice cold intellect hiding a quiet softness.*

---

**Trey (watching the three like he‚Äôs narrating a nature documentary):**  
""Camille smells lies before you tell ‚Äòem. Paloma can disassemble a Leica blindfolded and reassemble your childhood trauma while she‚Äôs at it. And Rhea... let‚Äôs just say she once made a man cry using only a whiteboard marker.""

*Enter Daniel Rodriguez ‚Äì soft-spoken, spectacled, slightly sweaty from the morning‚Äôs Zodiac duties. He‚Äôs trying to play it cool. He‚Äôs failing.*

**Trey (voiceover):**  
""And here comes Daniel‚Äîmy roommate, my responsibility, and the most emotionally avoidant superhero in North America. He has no idea that all three of these women are gonna be future chapters in his personal rom-com of doom.""

---

### **Scene: Camille‚Äôs Desk**

*Camille corners Daniel with a folder in hand.*

**Camille:**  
""You filed this under ‚ÄòSpecial Assignment‚Äô? Daniel, this isn‚Äôt an expos√©, it‚Äôs a Yelp review with delusions of grandeur.""

**Daniel (nervously):**  
""I‚Äîit had thematic weight! Emotional resonance!""

""He wrote a review of a taco truck, Camille. Let the man vibe.""

**Camille (to Daniel):**  
""Fix it. Or I will ghostwrite it, put your name on it, and let you take the Pulitzer hit.""

### **Scene: Paloma‚Äôs Darkroom**

*Paloma drags Daniel into the photo lab.*

**Paloma:**  
""You ruined my negative, Rodr√≠guez! That light leak was cosmic. Unless your aura‚Äôs radioactive?""

*She stares at him through narrowed eyes, close enough to notice his pulse skip.*

**Daniel:**  
""I‚ÄîI might have been... in the vicinity of something with unstable isotopes?""

**Trey (poking his head in):**  
""Translation: he did something heroic and dumb again. Classic Z.""

**Paloma (to Trey):**  
""I will punch you with a tripod.""

### **Scene: Rhea‚Äôs Cubicle**

*Rhea‚Äôs typing with intensity. Daniel cautiously approaches, holding a printed draft of something about ‚Äúbioethical nanotech legislation.‚Äù*

**Daniel:**  
""Hey... um. Thought you might want to review this before I submit it to editorial?""

**Rhea (barely looking up):**  
""This entire second paragraph reads like it was written by ChatGPT on NyQuil.""

*Trey walks by, holding a donut.*

**Trey (to Daniel):**  
""You‚Äôre gonna marry that one, huh?""

**Daniel (sputtering):**  
""Wh‚Äîwhat?""

**Rhea (calmly):**  
""He‚Äôs not wrong.""

---

### **Mid-Episode: Lunch Break Meltdown**

*Daniel tries to sneak out for lunch. All three women end up at the same corner caf√©. Unplanned. Daniel walks in. Freezes. Trey watches from a nearby table with a knowing smirk.*

**Trey (voiceover):**  
""I told him not to date within the office. I *told* him. But did he listen? No. Because when you're a part-time superhero and full-time himbo, common sense is just optional.""

*Chaos ensues: passive-aggressive jabs, subtle one-upmanship, Daniel sweating like he‚Äôs diffusing a bomb.*

---

**Closing Scene:**

*Later that night, back at the apartment. Daniel collapses onto the couch. Trey tosses him a beer.*

**Daniel:**  
""They all hate me.""

**Trey:**  
""Wrong. They all *love* you. That‚Äôs worse.""

*Daniel groans. Trey leans back, grinning.*

**Trey (voiceover):**  
""Three smart, scary women. One oblivious golden retriever in glasses. What could possibly go wrong?""

Getting a good night‚Äôs sleep is crucial for your health, mood, and energy levels. But did you know that what you eat during the day‚Äîand especially before bedtime‚Äîcan drastically affect your ability to fall and stay asleep? Yes, your dinner choices or late-night snacks may either sabotage or enhance your slumber.

# Foods That Help You Sleep Better

https://preview.redd.it/juzdbpb3b9ue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=0178a6fc286a002c779203adb4cd8df99e2a9443

Food plays a key role in regulating your body‚Äôs internal clock and producing sleep-friendly hormones. Consuming the following [**foods**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/category/healthy-eating/) may help you drift off quickly and enhance the quality of your rest.

**1. Almonds**

Almonds are not only a nutritious snack but also a [**sleep**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/smart-ways-to-sleep-better-and-wake-up-energized/) hero. They‚Äôre rich in magnesium, a mineral that improves sleep quality by reducing inflammation and regulating melatonin levels, the hormone responsible for your sleep-wake cycle.

A small handful of almonds before bed can give your body a boost of nutrients it needs to relax and prepare for sleep.

**2. Kiwi**

This delicious green fruit is a powerhouse of sleep-inducing nutrients. Kiwis are high in antioxidants like vitamin C and serotonin, which have been linked to improved sleep duration and efficiency. A study also found that eating two kiwis an hour before bedtime helped participants fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly.

**3. Chamomile Tea**

While technically a drink, chamomile tea deserves a spot on this list. Packed with powerful antioxidants and apigenin‚Äîa compound that binds to receptors in your brain and promotes sleepiness‚Äîthis tea is a relaxing choice before bed.

**4. Fatty Fish**

Salmon, mackerel, and tuna aren‚Äôt just good for your heart‚Äîthey‚Äôre also fabulous for your sleep. Fatty fish are rich in vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients work together to regulate serotonin production, enhancing your [**mood**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/exercise-energy-and-mood-understanding-the-connection/) and sleep cycle.

**5. Bananas**

Bananas are full of sleep-supporting nutrients like magnesium and potassium. These minerals relax your muscles and nerves, reducing physical tension that could keep you awake. Plus, their natural sugar content can help trigger serotonin production.

**6. Tart Cherries**

Tart cherries are among the few natural sources of melatonin. Drinking tart cherry juice or snacking on dried tart cherries before bed has been shown to improve both sleep duration and quality.

# Foods That Disrupt Your Sleep

https://preview.redd.it/y8u7c0n5b9ue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebffdf7d200f417fa6ad849d78d9dc5bd0aa6daf

While some foods help improve your sleep quality, others can do the exact opposite. Here are the main culprits to avoid for a peaceful night:

**1. Caffeine**

It‚Äôs no surprise that coffee is a sleep disruptor, but caffeine hides in other foods and beverages, too. Soda, chocolate, and even some teas can keep you awake. Caffeine is a stimulant that blocks adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep. Its effects can last for hours, so cut caffeine at least six hours before bedtime.

**2. Spicy Foods**

Foods like spicy curries or hot sauces may taste amazing, but they can wreak havoc on your sleep. Spices can cause heartburn or indigestion, especially when eaten close to bedtime. Plus, they can raise your body temperature, making it harder to fall asleep.

**3. Alcohol**

Although a glass of wine might make you feel drowsy initially, alcohol disrupts REM sleep, the most restorative sleep stage. It can also lead to frequent wake-ups during the night, decreasing your overall sleep quality.

**4. Sugary Snacks**

Candy bars, cookies, or other sugary snacks can spike your blood sugar levels. This not only makes it harder to fall asleep but may also cause you to wake up during the night as your blood sugar crashes.

**5. Fried or Fatty Foods**

Greasy foods like fried chicken or cheesy fries are difficult to digest. Eating them late at night can lead to indigestion and discomfort, keeping you awake when you should be catching Z‚Äôs.

**6. High-Salt Foods**

Too much salt before bed can lead to dehydration and disrupt your body‚Äôs fluid balance. This could cause you to wake up in the middle of the night, thirsty or with an elevated heart rate. Salty snacks like chips or processed foods are best avoided before bedtime.

# Sleep-Friendly Eating Tips

https://preview.redd.it/s52yf0clb9ue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c6fe633aea804698f24435a4e5d14d8bc51227

Besides knowing which foods to eat and avoid, following these practical tips can further improve your sleep:

* **Time Your Meals:** Avoid heavy meals two to three hours before bedtime. A light snack is fine, but eating large meals too close to bedtime can cause indigestion.
* **Balance Blood Sugar:** Pair complex carbs (like whole-grain crackers) with protein (like peanut butter) to stabilize your blood sugar levels and avoid waking up hungry.
* **Consistent Routine:** Try to eat meals and snacks at roughly the same times each day. A consistent food schedule can help regulate your body clock.
* **Stay Hydrated:** While drinking water throughout the day is essential, try to limit fluids close to bedtime to avoid waking up for bathroom trips.

# Why Food Impacts Sleep

https://preview.redd.it/rex3nnrnb9ue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=58eb6927f979444aaea249384c71a71009f60ac2

You might be wondering, *Why does what I eat matter so much for sleep?*

The answer lies in the complex relationship between food, hormones, and your body‚Äôs circadian rhythm‚Äîor internal clock. Certain foods boost the production of serotonin and melatonin, hormones that tell your body when it‚Äôs time to sleep and wake up.

On the other hand, stimulants like caffeine, sugar, or heavy meals interfere with these hormones or your body‚Äôs physical comfort, sabotaging restful sleep.

## Key Features Analysis

The‚Äå selection of ‚Å¢the ideal leather couch cover hinges on several key features. Material quality, sizing flexibility, ease of installation, aesthetic appeal, and maintenance requirements all ‚Å§play crucial roles.

**Material Composition:** The durability and aesthetic of a ‚Å£leather couch cover are directly impacted by the type and quality ‚Å§of materials utilized in their construction.

Genuine leather couch‚Äç covers are crafted from actual animal hides, offering‚Å¢ the most authentic look and feel. These are typically ‚Äåmore expensive but provide‚Äå superior durability and can develop a desirable patina over time. ‚Å£Faux leather alternatives, often made from PU (polyurethane) or PVC (polyvinyl chloride), mimic the appearance of genuine leather at a more affordable price point, and are often ‚Å¢easier to clean. Microfiber blends offer a ‚Å¢soft and supple alternative with enhanced‚Å£ stain resistance.

**Sizing‚Äå and Fit:** A well-fitting couch cover not ‚Å£only looks better but also provides optimal protection.

Accurate measurements are crucial to ensure proper fit. Most manufacturers provide detailed ‚Å£sizing guides, requiring measurements of the couch's length, width, and height.‚Å£ Adjustable straps, elastic hems, and separate cushion covers can accommodate a‚Å§ wider range of couch styles and‚Äã sizes.Some covers are‚Äç specifically designed for ‚Å£sectional sofas, while others are worldwide fits.‚Å£ always double-check compatibility before purchasing.

**Installation and Removal:** Easy‚Å£ installation and removal are critically important considerations for convenience, especially for frequent cleaning or style updates.

Slipcovers with elastic straps and non-slip backing are generally easier to install,‚Å¢ requiring minimal effort to ‚Å£secure ‚Å£in ‚Äãplace. Zipper closures and buckle systems can ‚Äåprovide a more ‚Äåsnug and secure fit but may require more time and effort to install. The ease of ‚Äçremoval is equally critically important for machine washing or spot cleaning. Clear instructions included with the cover can simplify the installation process.**Aesthetic Design:** The cover‚Å£ should complement the existing d√©cor and personal style preferences.

Leather‚Å£ couch covers are available in various colors, textures, and patterns. Neutral ‚Äçtones like brown, black, and beige are classic choices‚Äç that blend well‚Å§ with most ‚Äçinteriors. Embossed patterns, quilted designs, and decorative stitching can add visual interest.Consider the overall aesthetic of your room and choose‚Å§ a cover that enhances rather than clashes with your existing furniture and d√©cor.

**Maintenance and Care:** The ease of cleaning and overall maintenance contributes to the long-term value and convenience of the couch cover.

Genuine leather covers typically require professional‚Å£ cleaning or specialized leather care products. Faux ‚Å¢leather and microfiber covers are often machine washable and stain-resistant, making them easier to maintain. Regular vacuuming and spot cleaning can help prevent the buildup of dirt and spills. Always refer to the manufacturer's care instructions to ensure the ‚Å§longevity of the cover.

## Core Benefits

Investing ‚Äåin a leather couch cover offers several key benefits, including protection, style enhancement, and cost savings.

**Protection‚Å§ Against Wear ‚Å§and Tear:** A primary benefit‚Äå of a leather couch cover is its ability to shield‚Äç your couch from‚Äã everyday wear and tear. Spills, stains, scratches from pets, and fading from sunlight can prematurely age a leather couch. A protective cover acts as a barrier, preserving the original‚Äå condition of ‚Å£the leather ‚Äåand extending its lifespan. For example, a stain-resistant cover can ‚Å¢prevent permanent damage from accidental ‚Å¢spills of coffee, wine, or food. A scratch-resistant cover protects the leather from pet ‚Äçclaws, preventing unsightly tears and scuffs.

**Style‚Äç Enhancement and Versatility:** Leather couch covers ‚Äãprovide ‚Äåan easy and affordable way ‚Å§to update the look of your living room without‚Äç purchasing ‚Å§a new couch. You can change the color, texture, or‚Å£ pattern of your couch to match your ‚Äçcurrent d√©cor or seasonal trends. For instance, a dark brown leather cover can give ‚Å£a sophisticated ‚Äãand classic look, while‚Å¢ a ‚Äãlight-colored cover can ‚Äçbrighten‚Äã up‚Äã a room. Changing covers seasonally allows you to ‚Äçintroduce new styles‚Äç and create a fresh ambiance without a large financial investment.**Cost Savings and Extended Lifespan:** Protecting your leather‚Å¢ couch with a ‚Äåcover ‚Å¢can save you significant money in the long run.repairs or replacements of ‚Å¢damaged leather can be expensive. By preventing damage from occurring in the first place, a ‚Äãcouch cover can definitely ‚Äãhelp extend the lifespan of your furniture. For example,‚Å§ preventing sun‚Å¢ damage can avoid the leather from cracking and fading, a common issue with ‚Äãolder leather ‚Å¢couches. The initial cost of a cover‚Äã is far less than the cost of repairing or replacing a‚Å§ damaged couch.

1jwy0u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jwy0u6/newbie_here_confused_on_how_to_improve/,Newbie here: confused on how to improve,"Hi all. I've recently taken the dive into this coffee thing and have been learning a lot. I think I went too deep down the rabbit hole and have some questions that I'm hoping those more seasoned here can help me with. I‚Äôve been watching Lance Hedrick talk about the espresso extraction curve with regards to grind level. Since it is impossible to hit that peak everytime, he prefers to stay on the coarser side for sake of consistency and evenness of extraction. Makes sense.

But this is what confuses me:

If we‚Äôre using shot time as our main metric to determine grind size, then wouldn‚Äôt going coarser lead to shots that pull too quickly? Especially if we‚Äôre supposed to aim for a 25‚Äì30 second shot for good extraction?

There are also a ton of things that supposedly help us make better coffee, but all of them seem to increase flow:

* Pre-infusion promotes extraction but speeds up flow
* Precision HE baskets like the Pesado and Weber boost extraction but also increase flow
* Having a coarser grind results in quicker flow
* Lance recommends maxing out the flow rate on the machine

So if I do *all* of these things, wouldn't I end up with a super fast shot? 

I also came across studies saying contact time is one of the most important factors in good espresso. So now I‚Äôm wondering:

How do I reconcile all these tools and techniques that improve extraction but reduce shot time ‚Äî without ending up pulling 1:10 shots if I pull for more than 10 seconds? Pressure should be held at 9 bars, which means I really have no more variables left to control.

Would love to hear how others balance this. Do you go for longer ratios? Or just stop worrying about time completely and go by taste?",2,1744398859.0,espresso,13,1.0,False

Getting a good night‚Äôs sleep is crucial for your health, mood, and energy levels. But did you know that what you eat during the day‚Äîand especially before bedtime‚Äîcan drastically affect your ability to fall and stay asleep? Yes, your dinner choices or late-night snacks may either sabotage or enhance your slumber.

# Foods That Help You Sleep Better

https://preview.redd.it/zhzvlm7w89ue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b7a2d04d0cea4a7154938b5d56ad04a3ee0b474

Food plays a key role in regulating your body‚Äôs internal clock and producing sleep-friendly hormones. Consuming the following [**foods**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/category/healthy-eating/) may help you drift off quickly and enhance the quality of your rest.

**1. Almonds**

Almonds are not only a nutritious snack but also a [**sleep**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/smart-ways-to-sleep-better-and-wake-up-energized/) hero. They‚Äôre rich in magnesium, a mineral that improves sleep quality by reducing inflammation and regulating melatonin levels, the hormone responsible for your sleep-wake cycle.

A small handful of almonds before bed can give your body a boost of nutrients it needs to relax and prepare for sleep.

**2. Kiwi**

This delicious green fruit is a powerhouse of sleep-inducing nutrients. Kiwis are high in antioxidants like vitamin C and serotonin, which have been linked to improved sleep duration and efficiency. A study also found that eating two kiwis an hour before bedtime helped participants fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly.

**3. Chamomile Tea**

While technically a drink, chamomile tea deserves a spot on this list. Packed with powerful antioxidants and apigenin‚Äîa compound that binds to receptors in your brain and promotes sleepiness‚Äîthis tea is a relaxing choice before bed.

**4. Fatty Fish**

Salmon, mackerel, and tuna aren‚Äôt just good for your heart‚Äîthey‚Äôre also fabulous for your sleep. Fatty fish are rich in vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients work together to regulate serotonin production, enhancing your [**mood**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/exercise-energy-and-mood-understanding-the-connection/) and sleep cycle.

**5. Bananas**

Bananas are full of sleep-supporting nutrients like magnesium and potassium. These minerals relax your muscles and nerves, reducing physical tension that could keep you awake. Plus, their natural sugar content can help trigger serotonin production.

**6. Tart Cherries**

Tart cherries are among the few natural sources of melatonin. Drinking tart cherry juice or snacking on dried tart cherries before bed has been shown to improve both sleep duration and quality.

# Foods That Disrupt Your Sleep

https://preview.redd.it/8zl4x2sy89ue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2faf6161b5247c87ee7daa81da9879bee35d5ec

While some foods help improve your sleep quality, others can do the exact opposite. Here are the main culprits to avoid for a peaceful night:

**1. Caffeine**

It‚Äôs no surprise that coffee is a sleep disruptor, but caffeine hides in other foods and beverages, too. Soda, chocolate, and even some teas can keep you awake. Caffeine is a stimulant that blocks adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep. Its effects can last for hours, so cut caffeine at least six hours before bedtime.

**2. Spicy Foods**

Foods like spicy curries or hot sauces may taste amazing, but they can wreak havoc on your sleep. Spices can cause heartburn or indigestion, especially when eaten close to bedtime. Plus, they can raise your body temperature, making it harder to fall asleep.

**3. Alcohol**

Although a glass of wine might make you feel drowsy initially, alcohol disrupts REM sleep, the most restorative sleep stage. It can also lead to frequent wake-ups during the night, decreasing your overall sleep quality.

**4. Sugary Snacks**

Candy bars, cookies, or other sugary snacks can spike your blood sugar levels. This not only makes it harder to fall asleep but may also cause you to wake up during the night as your blood sugar crashes.

**5. Fried or Fatty Foods**

Greasy foods like fried chicken or cheesy fries are difficult to digest. Eating them late at night can lead to indigestion and discomfort, keeping you awake when you should be catching Z‚Äôs.

**6. High-Salt Foods**

Too much salt before bed can lead to dehydration and disrupt your body‚Äôs fluid balance. This could cause you to wake up in the middle of the night, thirsty or with an elevated heart rate. Salty snacks like chips or processed foods are best avoided before bedtime.

# Sleep-Friendly Eating Tips

https://preview.redd.it/t07dfz4199ue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb35b7db6c1a330f509979d14114067eb62a2b1e

Besides knowing which foods to eat and avoid, following these practical tips can further improve your sleep:

* **Time Your Meals:** Avoid heavy meals two to three hours before bedtime. A light snack is fine, but eating large meals too close to bedtime can cause indigestion.
* **Balance Blood Sugar:** Pair complex carbs (like whole-grain crackers) with protein (like peanut butter) to stabilize your blood sugar levels and avoid waking up hungry.
* **Consistent Routine:** Try to eat meals and snacks at roughly the same times each day. A consistent food schedule can help regulate your body clock.
* **Stay Hydrated:** While drinking water throughout the day is essential, try to limit fluids close to bedtime to avoid waking up for bathroom trips.

# Why Food Impacts Sleep

https://preview.redd.it/iwnshqt299ue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=5329e615deb4066b70ad88ae3c2a88e33cf1894f

You might be wondering, *Why does what I eat matter so much for sleep?*

The answer lies in the complex relationship between food, hormones, and your body‚Äôs circadian rhythm‚Äîor internal clock. Certain foods boost the production of serotonin and melatonin, hormones that tell your body when it‚Äôs time to sleep and wake up.

On the other hand, stimulants like caffeine, sugar, or heavy meals interfere with these hormones or your body‚Äôs physical comfort, sabotaging restful sleep.

# Sleep Better Tonight by Choosing Your Foods Wisely

The connection between food and sleep is powerful. By choosing the right snacks and avoiding the wrong ones, you can set yourself up for a more restful night and wake up feeling refreshed.

Seems like a simple thing until you see how much of a motherly figure Dana plays in the show. She is there for

But when she needed just one simple thing after one of the worst days of her career, after comforting everyone, keeping them as even as she could... she had to clean her own cup.

Out of everything that was in that episode? That hit some weird spot in me. I've been thinking about it for the day and, damn, they both need and don't fully deserve her...
but maybe that's the point. Because she didn't complain.
Didn't break down (that's for the trip home, keep the hospital and house separate). She just kept pushing listening to the last flails of Langdon.

1jwxpm7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jwxpm7,Before/After upgrade,"    I really wanted to make this post as a way to say thank you to everyone in this community for all the knowledge you guys share. It's been fun to gain this as a hobby even though I was in denial that that's what it was becoming. You guys are all great and funny and it's fun to nerd out on some really niche stuff with other people. You guys all really help me to feel confident that I wasn't overspending or purchasing things that I shouldn't yet buy because of where my skill level is at.

    Finally was allowed to upgrade my whole setup from what my wife and I got when we got married. We made that little DeLonghi unit work for us. We never used the drip function on it except for a couple of times, like holidays. That oxo conical Burr grinder also worked for us pretty well. I believe that hole first setup was less than 400 bucks for us. 

    Now the new stuff has been so great. The MiiCoffee Apex is the 2gen run, mine came with the single hole nozzle preinstalled. It is so much better at steaming milk than my previous unit that I couldn't tell you if it wasn't great. Cleaning is easy, maintenance is easy. I've now owned both the grinder and espresso machine for about 8 months. In those 8 months the machine has gotten a very small leak. To some this might sound unacceptable, for me, I know it's probably a simple fix if I just pull the machine apart. However, I am a man of short time and in the 2 and 1/2 months that this leak has been going on. It has not damaged anything and it has not affected my pressure when I pull a shot and it is very very slight. So however they've arranged electronics inside seem to be fairly leak resistant. One of the first things I did with the machine was test out the flow rate and I love that at the price that it is I was able to change the water debit. Genuinely a godsend and I have only changed it once and I'm just adjusting grind size and bean quantity. I've been able to get my shot poles to peak at 11 bar and fall to 9 bar which so far in most of the coffees I've been using has produced a really nice sweet shot. The only real complaint I have about the machine is the god-awful MiiCoffee branding on the face of the catch tray and that the milk steam icon on the milk steam knob is not level when it's in the off position. And extremely minor thing to note for the few people that is really matters to, the milk. Steamer knob has a good amount of turn to it but not too much which would lead you to believe that you the amount of steam can be an adjustable variable, however, the knob essentially works as an on off switch. Switch. You turn it and at a certain point it turns on the pump for the milk. Milk wand and it doesn't matter if you go to the max turn or not. Maybe I'm doing something wrong with it or maybe my unit lacks the granularity that should be there. Either way it still steams great milk.

    I love the DF 83v it's all the grinder I need and more. I ended upgrading the burrs SSP Labsweet and it was a noticable difference. Zeroing it in was easy. Grind retention is very minimal since it has both the ionizer on the end of the chute and because of the bellow included. I love the Walnut accent that the lid is on the bellow. My only actual complaint with the grinder is at the bellow does feel like an afterthought because it is easily knocked off because it does not have enough tension on the ring that it holds onto. But for the value and the features at the price that it is, I also did not pay full price for the grinder or the espresso machine, it is hard for me to knock it on a bellow that doesn't stay on firmly.
    I am now addicted to my morning espresso routine, I have started a grind profile journal for the different beans I've been using. Everyday when I make coffee for myself and my wife, I feel like I'm using $1,000+ machines. The few drawbacks of both machines are heavily outweighed by the feature per dollar value that they both have.

    Feel free to ask me questions about either unit if you want, but I'm assuming most of you guys on here know way more than I do. And I would like to leave you all with the wisdom and insight I have learned from so many of you, make sure you grind finer. üòÅüòÜ",1,1744398073.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1jwxowy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1jwxowy/im_tired/,I'm tired,"Hi everyone,

I've been dealing with GERD for the past few months. I believe the main trigger was a period where I drank a lot of coffee and orange juice, and I had a completely irregular eating schedule ‚Äî I‚Äôd have lunch at 6pm, dinner at 5am, and breakfast at 1pm. My routine was totally out of sync due to my university workload.

In December 2024, I was diagnosed with GERD. I was prescribed esomeprazole (morning and night), a gastric motility drug (Endial) before meals, and sucralfate.

Right now, I'm taking esomeprazole 20 mg twice a day and Milpax F (an antacid) after meals. It's been almost 4 months on medication. Sometimes, it felt like the symptoms were gone, but then they'd come back again.

My diet has been super restricted: mostly boiled foods, no spicy stuff, no coffee, no chocolate, no alcohol, and no acidic foods at all. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know what else to do.

The endoscopy I had in December showed that my lower esophageal sphincter (LES) was slightly open.

Can coffee and orange juice really cause this much damage? Has anyone had a similar experience ‚Äî sticking to meds and a strict diet, but the symptoms still persist?

I‚Äôm not overweight, and I exercise regularly. Swimming actually seems to help relieve some of the symptoms. At this point, I‚Äôm seriously considering surgery.

Do you think there might be another underlying cause?

Any help or shared experiences would be appreciated!",1,1744398029.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Okay, so I know this sounds ridiculous, but hear me out.

I (28M) was on my way to a Tinder date last weekend. We‚Äôd been chatting for a bit and things were getting flirty, and we agreed to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù at her place, if you catch my drift. I was feeling good, looking good, and I figured I‚Äôd grab an iced coffee from McDonald‚Äôs to perk me up on the way.

Now, this is where things went off the rails.

I get the iced coffee, put it in my cup holder, and start driving. I go over a speed bump and BOOM‚Äîlid pops off and the entire drink spills right into my lap. We‚Äôre talking full lap splash zone. The thing is, it was really cold. Like, unreasonably cold. Antarctic glacier levels of cold. I swear I saw frost on the steering wheel.

So I get to her place a little damp, a little uncomfortable, but I figured it‚Äôd dry fast enough. We start chatting, things get spicy, clothes start coming off‚Äîand that‚Äôs when it happens.

She looks down and just loses it. Like full-on, can‚Äôt breathe, wheezing laughter. She starts pointing and says, ‚ÄúIs that it?‚Äù I try to explain‚Äîlike, it‚Äôs not normally like that, it‚Äôs shrinkage from the iced coffee‚Äîbut she‚Äôs not having it. She‚Äôs literally in tears laughing, and I‚Äôm sitting there half-naked and humiliated.

Needless to say, the mood died a horrible, icy death.

Now I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I‚Äôm embarrassed, traumatized, and honestly pissed. I feel like McDonald‚Äôs should‚Äôve had a warning on the cup or something about how cold it was. Maybe a sticker that says ‚ÄúWarning: May cause genital shrinkage if spilled.‚Äù At the very least, a better lid.

So I‚Äôve been seriously considering talking to a lawyer. I know people have sued over hot coffee being too hot‚Äîwhy can‚Äôt I sue over iced coffee being too cold?

My friends think I‚Äôm being ridiculous and that I should just let it go, but honestly, I feel like I‚Äôve suffered emotional damage here. AITA?

For me personally, an in-person community has been very fulfilling and rewarding, and provides me with connection that online spaces cannot.

Before we get started, I have a quick disclaimer. Firstly, this is my personal experience and circumstance. I am an adult in my own home and I do not live with strict parents or guardians of a different faith. Secondly, I live in a city where there are more opportunities to connect with people.  And lastly, I do live in a conservative area with a very small/quiet pagan community. However, I also live in an area that values religious freedom. Although some people may find it weird, I have never had an experience where someone outright discriminates against the pagan community. You may need to rework my pointers if your circumstances are different.

Without further ado, here are a few techniques that helped me find and build an in-person community:

1. **Facebook Groups:** I know many people tend to stay off FaceBook nowadays, but Facebook was a very valuable tool for me. By searching ‚Äò\[My city\] Pagan,‚Äô I discovered a couple of organized groups online. These spaces kept me up to date with pagan events happening in my city.
2. **Facebook Events:** Search for events using keywords such as, 'pagan,' or holiday names like, 'Beltane.' Sometimes you'll find gatherings happening near you.
3. **Metaphysical stores:** ‚ÄòWitchy‚Äô stores sometimes host events for the community. This can be a great opportunity to meet people face-to-face.
4. **Coffee meet-and-greets**: If anyone is thinking of hosting an event, this is a great one to start with since it‚Äôs low effort, in a public setting, and it‚Äôs not a big deal if no one shows up. Simply make a reservation at a cafe, and post the details on social media.
5. **Get out there!** As long as you put yourself out there and make an effort to connect with people, you will meet someone. Once you have a solid footing with a couple of people within the space, they will invite you into their personal pagan sphere and you will meet other people.

Of course, always exercise caution and safety within these settings. Unfortunately, there are a few folkist practitioners out there and it is important to be aware of this. However, by using these techniques I have connected with a wonderful group of people that I practice with. I do hope this guide is helpful to anyone seeking community, but are unsure where to start.

I [19F] have been in an on and off relationship with my boyfriend [19M] for almost a year now. 

Some context: We're long distance and I'm planning to go to university in his city (always been my plan to go there) and he *was* helping me with all my study until now... 

A few days back, I had just taken a break from studying and was chatting with him. I was talking about having more coffee because I was tired and it was really late. He casually asks me how much I studied today and I told him what I did and was hoping (important word) to complete another chapter before sleeping, he said ""hoping won't do anything, go and study right now."" 

Now, i wouldn't usually get mad at something so small like this, but I was tired, cranky from lack of sleep and just wanted to have a little break and talk with him. So I told him okay I'm going to study and after an hour and a half just told him goodnight and went to sleep.
 
The next day there was no text from him in the morning and I didn't get one the whole day. 
Next day, i text him asking if he was okay and why he didn't text me and at first he said he thought I was studying and after some time he told me he didn't send me back to hear goodnight and that if I don't want to I don't have to update him anymore and he won't ask either. I explained to him that I was upset about what he said and texted him today because I was going to update him on my progress but because of his text, didn't say anything and because he said goodnight first, I said goodnight too and went back to studying. 
After a while I see he just reacted with a thumbs up and didn't say anything. 

It's been four days and I haven't received a text from him. I don't even know if he's mad or why he is giving this silent treatment and I'm confused. It hurts me to see him being like this and this isn't the first time I've received a silent treatment out of nowhere. There was this one time he did this and when I asked him why, he said he thought I was joking and was going to call me soon..
I've told him that time that atleast even if he *did* think it was a joke, he could've texted me..
Now, I'm thinking about ending things with him because I've been clear about things like this before and this won't be the only reason I leave him..
Also, I'm thinking of waiting a week before doing anything to see if he texts/calls me or not. 
I'm just so confused about my decision and thinking if this will be right or not. Should I break up? 

Tl;dr : My boyfriend is giving me the silent treatment and I haven't received a text from him. I'm thinking about ending things because this has happened before as well for no solid reason and I can't keep doing this anymore. It hurts my feelings. ",2,1744397621.0,self,4,1.0,False

1jwxefa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jwxefa/bingo_review_legends_lattes_by_travis_baldree/,Bingo Review: Legends & Lattes by Travis Baldree,"This is my first time participating in r/Fantasy's Book Bingo, my first time reviewing a book and only the second time I read a book that could be classified as ""Cozy Fantasy"". I will not shy away from spoilers, as I think there's rather little to spoil in this book, and the review would be even shorter if I could not speak about central parts of the plot. 

  
Legends & Lattes is only my second book in the ""Cozy Fantasy"" genre, only preceded by ""The House by the Cerulean Sea"" by TJ Klune. I'm usually open to new genres, though my interests lie primarily in books that explore ideas or characters deeply, and as such it's beginning to dawn on me that this might not be the genre for me. I'll try to highlight what it is that I liked with ""The House by the Cerulean Sea"", and why Legends & Lattes felt a bit flat to me.   
  
The premise of Legends & Lattes is an attractive one to me- as a casual participant in several D&D campaigns, the idea of high fantasy with modern highjinx isn't a foreign concept to me, and immediately I was curious about how the aspects of Fantasy, caf√©s and a cozy story would blend together. In the initial chapters, learning about what Viv needs to start her coffee shop is intriguing, as this is a world in which coffee is a thing most have never even heard of. With the help of the Scalvert's Stone, a stone that supposedly provides the holder with luck in their endeavours, she acquires the necessary components to transform a livery into an attractive caf√© over the course of the first two thirds of the book.   


Baldree's writing is very functional, but at it's best when describing mechanisms, construction as well as the experiences of the characters when tasting and smelling the coffees and baked goods unveiled in the early chapters. Then, his language is evocative of the familiar experiences of an ideal caf√© visit, in addition to some creative twists, and the characters unique interests in different aspects required for the caf√© are highlighted in a wonderful way. What Baldree fails to deliver at is everything else about his writing. Though his prose, vocabulary and dialogue is not as painful to read as someone like Brandon Sanderson, it is also not very inspired. Dialogue mostly only functions as a way of communicating what the characters need to say in any given moment, without any thought given to what a person would actually say and withhold in the respective scenes. Characters will seldom talk to each other as though they are talking to someone they've just met, and the specifics of why the characters even like each other or stick together is often completely lost in language that's more interested in progressing the story and checking off the right check-marks than creating believable dynamics. In the first two thirds of the story, this can easily be hand-waved as a result of the effects of the Scalvert's Stone lessening the friction of opening the caf√©, but as we head on into the resolution of the story's many substories, Baldree's writing starts to show its shortcomings. 

The first significant resolution to a plotline in this book comes when Viv is faced with the dilemma of paying the Madrigal her dues (who's a basic shadowy mafia boss) or refusing. Viv is a character who has seldom had to bend to the will of others due to her stature, but at this point in the story, Viv has built a caf√©, garnered customers and nurtured friendships that she acknowledges she might be unable to protect with strength alone. Thus she sets up a meeting with the Madrigal to settle their dispute. Viv stands resolute when she meets the Madrigal, saying that she won't pay her dues, something that most readers will probably admire, given that it's standing up to what is essentially organized crime. The Madrigal gives little resistance to this at all, accepting that Viv not pay her dues for protection, but suggests that Viv instead pay it in products from the bakery section of her successful coffeeshop. Staggeringly, Viv agrees to this with a smile, as though the labour of her baker and only indirectly helping to finance organized crime is somehow more morally acceptable. To be fair to Baldree, he never explicitly states exactly why Viv is so opposed to paying her dues, but it's reasonable to assume, given the modern values held by most central characters in the book, that he objection is against the morality of organized crime. Thus starts the cascade of poorly thought-out resolutions to the plot lines of the story.

Following this, the required romantic subplot with Viv's employee Tandri gets a bit of attention. Tandri is a succubus, and Baldree half-heartedly implies that Viv is scared that any unique attention she gives Viv is only a mirage of Succubus magic, or the results of the Scalvert's Stone. The books main villain,  Fennus, a previous member of Viv's adventuring party hunts her Scalvert's Stone, feeling left out of his share of the most valuable treasure provided by their last adventure together. Viv's allies aid her in rebuffing his first attempt at stealing the stone from her. In what turns out to be the climax of the story, he sets fire to the caf√© as he steals the stone, with Viv and Tandri only making it out alive with aid from the resident but elusive dire-cat. 

  
Without further funds to rebuild, Viv's companions come together to rebuild the caf√©, with funds for the project secretly coming from the the Madrigal (wonder how she obtained that money?) and aid of the shipwright Calamity to build an even better caf√©. Viv and Tandri finally kiss after bonding over their shared love of the caf√©, they find out that the effects of the Scalvert's Stone merely brought together like-minded people and didn't actually guarantee good fortune for Viv's endeavours, and all of Viv's companions become equal partners in the business. 

On paper, there's not much wrong with the story. Aside from some dubious moral implications, predictable story points and twists and dull interactions between the characters, this book could have worked quite well based on its fun premise. What's missing though is something to make it all feel interesting. Whether it be more intelligently written humour, plot points that require some sort of sacrifice on the part of the characters, any depth to the few central characters or a more engaging romance plot, this book has everything, but does almost none of it better than average. Once the items on the menu are in place, there's little to look forward to in the book, and Baldree seems adamant to lessen the impact of any significant plot point in the story to keep with the ""cozy"" vibes. 

Contrast this with the low points of ""The House by the Cerulean Sea"", where even minor characters have to tangle at least a bit with how their unique character traits can cause inconveniences in the world at large. Legends & Lattes is a ""Cozy Fantasy"" book that provides all the aesthetic of the genre, but none of payoffs.

1jwxd0e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jwxd0e,"How to fix hollow, tired looking face? Im only 24 and i feel like i aged so much since last year. I get sleep but still look like a walking corpse :(","I'm so tired of people asking me if I'm ok and people randomly telling me they hope i feel better soon (a new pharmacist told me that?) wtf. I just want to look vibrant and alive and i used to but i feel like my smile looks strained and my eyes look exhausted and devoid of life even if i feel fine.

I have considered many factors as to what may contribute but im not really sure i can figure this out so maybe someone could help me figure out what i could do to bring back my liviness?  Maybe also someone has been in a similar boat and has something that worked

Some factors i considered

So i use tretinoin, but my skin still looks like this. It dries my skin out if i use it every day and its the lowest conc.

i dont have PERFECT sleep but ill look exhausted even after a streak of good sleep.

I dont always drink fully enough water but some days i do, for the most part i get close to enough.

My diet is pretty good most days- a smoothie where i blend together foods that would make a good food pyramid and have tons of vitamins, protein and fats in that. Then i have a bag of trail mix i much on throughout the day, have a protein bar for more protein, and usually have pasta for dinner (but its been a lot ofcereal bc i get sick of foods fast). admittedly i do indulge in a bit of candy as well when i get a craving, but my diet is pretty great for the most part so i dont think it should be much of an issue.

I am thin but in the healthy range for my height. I think it's more so that i have very long limbs that make me look willowy. 

I take adderall for school because i have pretty bad adhd, but i take a small amount and dont drink any form of coffee. 

. I also take trazodone for sleep which helps my sleep a lot.

I do have focal epilepsy that is not well controlled yet, but i have good periods of time between them and often stop the seizures early with an emergency med. I dont know if this can affect my appearance though.

I do have a scalp that gets very oily if i dont wash it every night, and i feel like it might be something with cortisol or hyperhidrosis that i have. Somehow i have bad dandruff even tho ive used shampoo for both the dry scalp and yesst bacteria (i assumed either greasy or dryness)

I‚Äôve been in Ahmedabad for 2 years now and, somehow, haven‚Äôt been on a single date or made any female friends. Been single for about 4 years‚Äîand while I‚Äôve tried dating apps more times than I can count, nothing really worked out.

My friends always tell me I‚Äôve got the looks, the vibe, and that I know how to treat someone right. So here I am‚Äîputting myself out there in a different way.

I‚Äôm not looking for anything super serious right now. Just someone cool to vibe with‚Äîcould be coffee, dinner, a walk, go-karting, bowling, or even just chilling and having deep conversations. If there's chemistry, maybe something more cozy‚Äîlike just being close, cuddling, or those quiet moments where things feel warm and easy. Nothing heavy or complicated, just real and fun.

I‚Äôve thought of approaching someone in person, but I honestly have no idea how to go about that‚Äîand I‚Äôm a little shy too. So, if you‚Äôre in Ahmedabad and want to make some spontaneous memories before I leave‚Äîor know someone who might‚Äîlet‚Äôs talk.

And I truly want to find a person I want to spend my life with

But I have quite non-standard situation.

I‚Äôm a war refugee from Ukraine living in Poland, I took my mother and grandmother from the dangerous zone - and taking care of them - financially, emotionally, paying the rent, most of food and etc - for 3 years already (since I‚Äôm 25, and I don‚Äôt see it would change any time soon)

My mother is living with me in a small apartment (I even sleep on the floor on a folding floor bed)

My grandma is living with her acquaintances closer to the countryside what she enjoys, being closer to the nature (I pay for her rent too, its price a little bit lower than on the market)

For mother this forced emigration was extremely painful, and I was helping her in any way to adapt - she learned the language a bit, finished local 1-year professions school and trying to work. Also, her cousin died on the war, and it was heartbreaking for her, and she still needs emotional support (we walk around the city together, drink some coffee, talks and etc).

In general, I feel quite good ‚Äì I feel to be good integrated into new society, I learned & speak local language on B2 level, I have a decent career in IT & make some savings, I found new friends (mostly other immigrants, but a few locals too), I try to go to socialising events at least 2-3 times a week (English club, coffee meetings, table games), I try to send packages to the native country with some help to other relatives.  
Also, I cook, clean and doing most of home stuff

Also, I was trying to do some PhD, I  have a few scientific articles, and I work as B2B, and doing all business taxes by myself without an accountant, and etc. When I told about that to some locals, they were mind-blowed (especially about doing taxes without an accountant, lol)

From one hand, I understand how much things I do & how I help relatives, but still, I often think that ""I'm not good enough"", I don't feel ""true mature"" - I like watch anime, cartoons, read comics and etc,  ""I live with mum"" and I feel lack of personal & private space (and I can't rent an additional apartment for myself - it costs too much to rent 2-3 places for me, and I want to make some savings) - and that means that basically I can't even take girl to my place.

I had a girlfriend here 1.5-2 years ago, when I only moved here, she was from my country, but she were so jealous I were spending time with mum - for groceries, doctors (for her), some short trips or weekends walks around the city to keep mental health. She blamed me ""it was not normal to spend so much time with them"" and hated my family. I'm afraid of most of girls can be like that.

I see a lot of beautiful local girls, I want to communicate with them, but I understand that not so many girls would be ready accept the fact, that I need to continue to take care of relatives, spend some time with them too.

Also, I'm an immigrant from a poor country with bad stereotypes, and have an accent & mistakes in the language. How many girls would be ok with that?

Even if I understand that I could be better than many young men here (which sometimes can be lazy even to do any sort of education after school)

I don't know what to do, how I should work on myself from now, and if I'm already ""good enough"" to find a person I want to spend my life with, and my ties with my family can break any relationships

‚∏ª

‚ÄúTWILIGHT ZONE‚Äù ‚Äì MUSIC VIDEO SCRIPT

Artist: Ariana Grande
Album: Eternal Sunshine Deluxe: Brighter Days Ahead (2025)
Concept: Love, war, and creation. A wife stands by her husband‚Äîhaunted by war, healing through art.
Tone: Romantic, psychological, noir-tinged surrealism.
Actor for Young Rod Serling: Jacob Elordi (sharp-featured, classic look, capable of portraying intensity and vulnerability).

‚∏ª

[INTRO ‚Äì NO MUSIC]

INT. BEDROOM ‚Äì NIGHT ‚Äì 1950s ‚Äì BLACK & WHITE
Rod (Jacob Elordi) bolts upright in bed, gasping. Ariana turns on the light‚Äîconcerned, used to this.

‚ÄúRod‚Ä¶ another one?‚Äù

He rubs his face. Doesn‚Äôt answer. Gets out of bed and goes to his desk in the corner.

She watches as he lights a cigarette and pulls out his typewriter. He begins to write.

CAMERA CLOSE-UP: The first words typed: ‚ÄúYou unlock this door with the key of imagination‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚∏ª

[VERSE 1 ‚Äì ARIANA SINGS]

‚ÄúDid I dream the whole thing?
Was I just a nightmare?‚Äù

INT. KITCHEN ‚Äì NIGHT
Ariana stares blankly at her coffee, alone. Rod‚Äôs silhouette types in the other room.

FLASHES ‚Äì WAR MEMORIES (SEPIA):
Rod in uniform. Explosions. The sound of a friend screaming. He grips a pen like a grenade.

‚ÄúDifferent dimensions
Stuck in the twilight zone‚Ä¶‚Äù

INT. HALLWAY ‚Äì TIME-SLIPPING ROOM
She walks past floating Twilight Zone props‚Äîgremlin mask, stopwatch, spiral patterns‚Äîswirling gently like snow.

‚ÄúIs this a black-and-white scene?
If so, then I‚Äôm in the gray one‚Ä¶‚Äù

Rod walks past her‚Äîbut doesn‚Äôt see her. Lost in his thoughts.

‚∏ª

[PRE-CHORUS]

‚ÄúDoes she know you‚Äôre not who you say you are?
‚ÄôCause I might give her a call‚Ä¶‚Äù

Ariana looks through a script Rod left behind. It‚Äôs clearly about her‚Äîbut twisted. Fictional. She wonders: Is this how he sees me?

‚ÄúOr was I just not me at all?‚Äù

‚∏ª

[CHORUS]

‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm still not over you‚Ä¶‚Äù

INT. NIGHTMARE ROOM ‚Äì SURREAL, DARK
Rod thrashes in bed. Ariana tries to calm him.

‚ÄúNot that I miss you, I don‚Äôt
Sometimes, I just can‚Äôt believe
You happened‚Ä¶‚Äù

She watches him the next day‚Äîsmiling at producers, shaking hands‚Äîbut sees the cracks behind his eyes.

‚∏ª

[VERSE 2 ‚Äì THE TURN]

‚ÄúWere we just mistaken?
Disguised our intentions?‚Äù

INT. WRITING ROOM ‚Äì STORM OUTSIDE
Rod writes. Rain falls. His typewriter starts writing on its own. Pages fly. The room spins.

EASTER EGGS FLOAT AROUND:
A ventriloquist dummy. The ‚ÄúEye of the Beholder‚Äù mask. The ‚ÄúTo Serve Man‚Äù cookbook.

‚ÄúWhy do I still protect you?
Pretend these songs aren‚Äôt about you?‚Äù

Ariana opens a drawer and finds old letters from the war. One reads: ‚ÄúIf I survive this, I‚Äôll write everything down so no one forgets.‚Äù

She cries quietly.

‚∏ª

[PRE-CHORUS ‚Äì EPIPHANY]

‚ÄúDoes she know you‚Äôre not who you say you are?‚Äù

She realizes: the horror in him wasn‚Äôt deception‚Äîit was memory. He wasn‚Äôt hiding from her. He was protecting her.

‚ÄúOr was I just not me at all?‚Äù

She puts her arms around him while he types. He doesn‚Äôt stop‚Äîbut leans into her touch.

‚∏ª

[CHORUS ‚Äì COLOR RETURNS]

‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm still not over you‚Ä¶‚Äù

INT. STUDIO SET ‚Äì NOW IN FULL COLOR
Rod and Ariana walk through a ‚ÄúTwilight Zone‚Äù soundstage. Past their younger selves. Past the scripts. Past the chaos.

They hold hands. Peaceful.

‚∏ª

[OUTRO ‚Äì TIMELESS LOVE]

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm over you‚Ä¶‚Äù

INT. LIVING ROOM ‚Äì MODERN DAY
Ariana and an older Rod sit together. She rests her head on his shoulder.

ON TV: The Twilight Zone intro plays.

‚ÄúSometimes, I just can‚Äôt believe
You happened‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚∏ª

FADE OUT.

TEXT ON SCREEN:
‚ÄúHe never escaped the war‚Äîbut he built a world where others could understand it. And she stayed, through every storm.‚Äù

Been having a really hard time dialling in this coffee a friend of mine got me. Columbian omniroast, roasted 25.03, bag was opened Monday 07.04 and the coffee was stored in an airtight container since.

Using a eureka Mignon Zero grinder, unmodified. 14 Grams before grinding, 14 grams after grinding (and i cleaned out the grinder as per daddy Hoffman‚Äòs instructions on Monday). The dose seems fine as the basket is made for 14 grams (IMS or La Marzocco basket, not sure anymore).

Using a Gaggia Classic Pro from 2024, with a 9 bar shades of coffee OPV spring and an IMS shower screen upgrade. I do 5 seconds of poor man‚Äòs pre-infusion as per lance hedrick‚Äòs review, and do temp surfing by waiting for the boiler light to go off then back on, doing a 5 second steam boiler activation and then pulling the shot.

The grinder is set to the point where it is just above where the burrs are touching, yet I get 42 grams out in 16ish seconds (the 5 seconds pre-infusion included). The 3:1 recipe was recommended by the roaster, as it is roasted very light for espresso.

During preparation, I measure coffee before grinding, after grinding, and after transferring to portafilter (I am slightly obsessive about being precise, I know) and get very little retention (0.1 grams of difference if any). I spray the beans slightly, WDT until the coffee is evenly distributed and free of clumps, tamp evenly and then use a profitec puck screen, which I steam out after every use and give a cafiza bath once a week.

Taste-wise there aren‚Äòt any defects, but the coffee tastes much less flavourful than what I am expecting. I‚Äòve had it pulled as espresso by the roaster, who‚Äòs a friend of the friend that gave me the coffee, and it tasted much fuller when he pulled it for me.

There are only a few options that I can think of:

- The eureka Mignon Zero can‚Äòt grind fine enough: While I believe it‚Äòs a very capable entry-to-mid level grinder, I have never had coffee this lightly roasted before, so I am unsure.

- The roast date is wrong: I don‚Äòt believe this to be the case (again, the coffee is roasted by a person that I know that does this commercially), but the only other time I have had similar issues dialling in was with very stale coffee.

Is there something else that I am missing? If i was grinding too fine and the coffee was channeling, I‚Äòm assuming I would taste that, no?",9,1744396478.0,espresso,41,0.92,False

‚ÄúBefore we start our lessons today, it is only right that we give thanks to our guests from the blood magic courses. If all of you behave and follow instructions then we will bore them with little more than some bruises to take care of.‚Äù Professor Zhang paced in front of his class as he spoke. Age had only dulled his dark orange skin slightly, and an active lifestyle kept him in excellent shape. Pacing around during lectures was just one way of staying in shape. ‚ÄúPlease thank them now for the inevitability that someone forgets what it means to *train* with magic.‚Äù

A chorus of thank yous rang out from the class during which time Xoco and Tonauac exchanged a small wave to one another from their respective groups. The campus arena complex had many sections devoted to both practice and competition. Xoco‚Äôs class often met here to practice, and Tonauac‚Äôs class often found themselves here to practice on the results of that practice.¬†

Cushioned mats lined the floors in contrast to the reinforced walls meant to weather errant spells. Around the room and amongst the rafters were familiars patiently fighting their instincts to help their mages in combat. The dueling class themselves wore blue practice uniforms that were padded to contend with the worst of their training rapiers while the blood mages in training wore white coveralls. In a bit of irony, the daggers at their belts made them more lethally armed than those who were actually in training for combat.¬†

‚ÄúAs promised, today we‚Äôll be practicing weapon casting.‚Äù The hobgoblin instructor continued after the brief offering of thanks. ‚ÄúTo review, who can tell the class *why* weapon casting is possible?‚Äù

Hands shot up from the combat crowd. Professor Zhang called on a lizardfolk boy next to Xoco.

‚ÄúSir! Because the Black Sun thinks it‚Äôs *awesome*?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably!‚Äù The professor barked back, pointed teeth revealed in a wry smile. ‚ÄúAnd until any of you get the chance to ask the god of magic himself, ‚Äòprobably‚Äô will have to do! What matters now is learning to cast combat spells with a weapon in place of precise hand motions. Miss Xoco! Please join me up front.‚Äù

The jungle troll girl snapped to attention and joined the professor in front of the class. This was a good way to clear her head. Remember all the lessons growing up that her family insisted upon‚Äì...focus on growing her skills beyond that. She had never learned any of this in all her lessons. It was all *hers*.

‚ÄúWind is a good element to start with. Perfect for opening up an opponent to a disabling strike.‚Äù Professor Zhang explained, referring to one of Xoco‚Äôs specialties. ‚ÄúXoco, please explain how you would normally cast a spell to try knocking me over with a blast of air.‚Äù

Xoco nodded down at her professor and spoke to the class. ‚ÄúStart with the feeling of air: Freedom turned into force. I would speak the name of the spell, and then make the required gestures. And‚Ä¶be aware of your breathing. You control it. Not the other way around.‚Äù¬†

Her hand moved in slow motion for the demonstration. Two fingers pointing outward drawing a semicircle, then an open palm thrust. Professor Zhang nodded and gestured for her to add it all together at a low power. Xoco took a deep breath, focused on that feeling of air, spoke the words of the spell in time with her right hand tracing the pattern, and fanned out a blast of air that sent motes of dust flying.¬†

Professor Zhang blinked, tucked an errant strand of gray hair back into his top knot, and spoke. ‚ÄúQuite the display for ‚Äòlow power‚Äô, Miss Xoco. Put the same amount of power into your next spell, but use your sword this time.‚Äù

Perhaps Xoco *was* feeling especially willful today. With a desperate desire for freedom and a desire to claim it. No matter. Don‚Äôt feel, Xoco, she told herself. *Think*, and focus on this next spell. She drew her practice sword from her hip and repeated her actions. Thoughts coming together as she spoke, carved a half circle in the air with her sword, and thrusted forward. The result was an even more intense blast of air that seemed capable of knocking an opponent down.

‚ÄúExcellent work, Miss Xoco. And thank you for the assistance‚Äù Professor Zhang complimented. He then went into further detail about everything that she had done, the theory behind casting in such a fashion, what types of weapons it could be done with, and how this lesson could be applied to other spells they would cover in the future.¬†

Individual practice time was more time for Xoco to throw herself into studies and think about less troubling things for a while. So much so that it looped back around into an effort to tone down the amount of power she was putting into spells. The training dummy being sent flying into a wall had luckily avoided colliding with anyone along the way.¬†

When it came time to pair up and spar, most avoided eye contact with Xoco. It was a problem that had seemed to get worse with time. First, few wanted to duel the girl who had won numerous fencing competitions before even entering mage school. Then, even less wanted to deal with any member of the most combat proven friend group in the first year. And finally, there were scarce volunteers after seeing how powerful her air spells were today.

Oh, and there was a slight chance that some felt that Xoco being taller than anyone in the class was an unfair advantage.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all cowards!‚Äù Announced a tonatecatl who was one of the larger varieties of his people with a broad build and beak to match. Still not nearly as tall as Xoco was but his courage was admirable. ‚ÄúGrant me the honor of battle, Xoco!‚Äù

She wasn‚Äôt about to turn down an honest request and smiled at the black feathered avian before pulling her helmet on.¬†

‚ÄúI accept! Who do I have the honor of dueling?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI am Ximac and I shall prove my mettle!‚Äù The large avian declared. Xoco noticed a tiny fault in his voice and saw his enlarged pupils. This bravado was more for himself than for anyone else but he showed no hesitation still.

Both of them got into position as Tonauac and another blood mage rushed over to act as observers and medics. What duels had already been going on around them slowed to watch who was daring to take on Xoco. Terms were ceremonially agreed upon which included only the one air spell being permitted to keep things fair.¬†

Swords were drawn, bows were exchanged, and the duel began.¬†

Ximac stayed light on his feet and slowly started to circle as he studied Xoco. He went for a high strike as a test and the jungle troll girl knocked away without effort. No good, he thought to himself. She was exactly as strong as she looked. Trying a fast low strike‚Ä¶that was parried into a near hit that Ximac only avoided as he quickly backstepped. Xoco didn‚Äôt press the attack and kept up her defensive stance.¬†

This wasn‚Äôt taunting so much as it was a demonstration that the avian‚Äôs strikes weren‚Äôt enough. A wall that let nothing pass. She didn‚Äôt have to say anything and didn‚Äôt even let out any grunts of exertion. Just clashes of steel as every strike Ximac attempted was denied.

¬†Ximac had to create an opening, and started to slice a semi-circle into the air‚Äì

As Xoco lunged and struck his armored wrist while he was mid-spell.

‚ÄúPoint Xoco!‚Äù Tonauac called out.

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶felt pretty effortless.‚Äù Ximac lamented as he got back into a fighting stance.

‚ÄúTry to get a hit in and I‚Äôll show you how I would use that spell in combat.‚Äù The jungle troll girl said without any malice.¬†

Ximac got the distinct feeling like he was volunteering to walk into a trap but reasoned that it would at least be an informative experience. However, he didn‚Äôt have to make it completely easy for her. The avian immediately struck high to catch her off guard as she parried the blow in a semi-circle. Only when the word ‚ÄòGust‚Äô was leaving her mouth and her sword was stabbing forward in a riposte did he realize he *did* make it easy for her.¬†

The ensuing gust of wind knocked Ximac backwards and off of his feet. Xoco advanced with a lunging step and made a downward slash at her opponent‚Äôs forearm while he flailed to try to catch himself before he could hit the mat.

‚ÄúPoint Xoco!‚Äù Tonauac and the other blood mage both announced as they rushed over to a Ximac that found himself momentarily dazed and sprawled out. He waved them off with an indignant sigh. All bravado was gone but so were the nerves. Such is the feeling of acceptance of being hopelessly outmatched but not in actual peril.

Xoco leaned down and extended a hand to help the tonatecatl back onto his feet. ‚ÄúIn close combat, use spells in a way that compliments their motion. That one works perfectly with a parry! And when someone‚Äôs falling it‚Äôs a good time to make a move!‚Äù

‚ÄúPerhaps I should have you as my teaching assistant, Miss Xoco?‚Äù Both duelists and both blood mages flinched as Professor Zhang appeared seemingly from nowhere.¬†

The jungle troll girl snapped to attention. ‚ÄúI intend only to help my fellow students learn, sir! And in doing so I learn as well!‚Äù

‚ÄúA wise idea indeed. With your assistance I‚Äôll show the class how to counter your counter.‚Äù The professor said as he gestured with his head for Ximac to step aside. Ximac‚Äôs eyes offered some sympathy to Xoco as he scurried out of the way. Zhang shook his head. ‚ÄúDo not mistake me. This is no punishment for Miss Xoco. I do this to encourage your skills to greater heights like all of my students.‚Äù

Xoco couldn‚Äôt help but feel a foreboding aura anyway. She knew she was skilled, but not skilled enough to take on someone who had made this his entire career. If her last duel had curious onlookers then this one had the entire training hall come to a stop to witness the match. From the gathering crowd Tonauac gave her a reassuring nod. At least he could help to heal up any possible injuries before meeting up for coffee with Isak.

Wait a minute was that a date she agreed to later today?

‚ÄúMiss Xoco was correct in that Gust is a good spell to use for a parry and riposte.‚Äù Professor Zhang‚Äôs lecture-duel brought her mind back down from the clouds. ‚ÄúIf you ever find yourself in close combat with a weapon, that would be a very wise move. However your opponent has tricks of their own that they could use to counter your counter. Miss Xoco, please perform the same move you did earlier when I try to strike you.‚Äù

The jungle troll girl slowed her breathing and focused. She took up a defensive stance as the professor got into position. Everything was telegraphed so far. Blades clashing together in probing tests to measure reactions and strength. Zhang had retained much strength even into his age and it appeared a lifetime as a mage had honed his reaction times into a razor‚Äôs edge.¬†

Which left Xoco with strength and reach.

Zhang‚Äôs slash was quick yet obviously still holding back. Xoco knew that something bad was coming but played the part. A parry, start to cast in the middle of a riposte and thrust‚Äì

The shocking spell that coursed through Zhang‚Äôs sword where it met Xoco‚Äôs and continued into her hand. It wasn‚Äôt much but it was enough for her to yelp and drop her sword. After which point she received a gentle tap on the wrist from the tip of Zhang‚Äôs practice blade.¬†

‚ÄúMy sincere apologies, but that needed to be strong enough for you to not weather the shock.‚Äù Professor Zhang bowed to Xoco then started in on a lesson. ‚ÄúSince I know you have all stopped practicing as you were instructed, you *might* be aware that mid strike I shocked Miss Xoco‚Äôs hand. For as much as you will all learn polite combat, I will teach you *im*polite combat as well. And if you‚Äôre clashing swords then a quick lightning spell can easily disable your opponent.‚Äù¬†

He leaned down to pick up Xoco‚Äôs sword, presented it back to her, and called over Tonauac. ‚ÄúSee that her hand is fine and then be ready for when she pays me back.‚Äù

The lizardlad helped Xoco with her training glove off to inspect for any damage. While lightly pressing a claw into the back of her hand he cast a spell and she felt any lingering warmth from the shock vanish. ‚ÄúGood as new! Also please do not break any of Professor Zhang‚Äôs bones. I have not learned Bone Stitch yet.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo, but *your* professor has mended more broken bones than you have in your body Mister Tonauac.‚Äù Professor Zhang nodded towards Professor Itzel who‚Äôs sigh was audible from across the room after having already mended two bones today and scowled several other students into being safer. ‚ÄúDo as you must in making our next clash an unfair one Miss Xoco. Show me what you‚Äôre capable of.‚Äù

The jungle troll nodded down towards her professor as they both took their places again, bowed, and took up their stances. Xoco very much did not know any lightning spells and needed to ask her storm mage to help her with that as soon as possible. Now that she knew Professor Zhang‚Äôs trick she was avoiding every strike rather than attempting to parry. Every lunge forward from the professor had her lunging back to put space between her and an inevitably electrified sword.

Oh. Right.¬†

It was simple as long as she stopped overthinking it.

Xoco feinted forward to get the professor to step back. The much taller girl leapt back as well and started to cast Gust. Professor Zhang tried to cover the distance between them but failed just in time to be hit with a full force gust of wind that sent him flying backwards. Xoco charged after him as he cast an air cloak upon himself to slow his fall.

The younger mage‚Äôs sword hit the padding of his shoulder as he was slowly descending towards the practice mats. Cheers broke out in the crowd that were tempered by not wanting to cheer *too* hard against the professor.

Professor Zhang nodded his approval to Xoco and removed his helmet to speak. ‚ÄúA height advantage is simple. Magic is complex. We shall continue to learn the complexities of using magic to turn fights to your favor. *Next class*. Dismissed!‚Äù

Students were quick to reunite with their familiars and head to the locker rooms to change back into their standard uniforms. More thank yous were given to the visiting blood mages before they departed the training hall. Xoco reunited with Nelli who settled upon her shoulders. Professor Zhang cleared his throat to get the young jungle troll‚Äôs attention.¬†

‚ÄúOh! Is all well, Professor?‚Äù She asked while Nelli nudged at her chin.

‚ÄúI should ask the same of you.‚Äù And in this way, he was doing just that. ‚ÄúYou were putting a lot of power into your spells. We should all be glad that when you finally did send someone flying they knew how to land well.‚Äù

‚ÄúEr‚Ä¶‚Äù Nerves were pushing her into a dagger filled smile. ‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you to be much more calm and collected than this. Is something troubling you?‚Äù

Many things, Xoco thought to herself. But even now she was likely being watched by some cousin or uncle eager to prove themselves invaluable to the family. Professor Zhang was not a needed complication.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶silly really.‚Äù This called for a distraction. Zhang leaned in as Xoco leaned down to whisper her dreadful secret. ‚ÄúYou see there‚Äôs this boy that‚Äôs had me distracted‚Äì

The hobgoblin snorted and backed away. All tension and serious concern was gone. ‚ÄúI must admit that even after two daughters it is my wife who would be the one to speak to on such matters.‚Äù

‚ÄúTruly? Because any advice‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúI advise you to focus on training to clear your head.‚Äù He said as he started to walk away from the conversation he quickly found himself growing uncomfortable with. ‚ÄúSorry to have troubled you.‚Äù

Too easy.¬†

Deny that there is a problem and people will pry further, Xoco smiled and thought to herself. Give them something embarrassing and uncomfortable to talk about and they will lose interest. And what father would ever want to speak to a teenage girl about ‚Äòboy problems‚Äô?¬†

That Xoco didn‚Äôt have any such problems at all was a white lie. Perhaps even her family would fall for this deception if she let the ‚Äòtruth‚Äô slip out enough. Let them believe that she was distracted by ‚Äòboy problems‚Äô all while she was secretly plotting against them.

In the meantime, she had to get ready to meet Isak for coffee.¬†

1jwx22x,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1jwx22x/advice_needed_about_bakery_premises_in_northern/,Advice needed about ‚Äúbakery‚Äù premises in Northern Ireland,"Hi all,
I‚Äôm looking for some advice regarding the terms of our commercial lease.

We run a bakery business in Northern Ireland and our lease states that the premises can only be used as a ‚Äúbakery‚Äù. We‚Äôve always operated as a traditional bakery‚Äîproducing and selling bread, pastries, cakes, etc.‚Äîbut we‚Äôve recently started offering hot food (things like sausage rolls, breakfast baps, toasties, soup, and coffee) which are either baked in-house or served using our baked goods.

The landlord is now questioning whether this is allowed under the ‚Äúbakery only‚Äù clause. We believe it is, since many bakeries across the UK (including in Northern Ireland) serve hot food as part of a modern bakery offering. We‚Äôre not running a restaurant or takeaway, and hot food is complementary to the baked goods we produce.

Questions:
	1.	Is there legal precedent or common interpretation that supports our position?
	2.	Would the inclusion of hot food, served as part of our bakery trade, likely be considered within the scope of ‚Äúbakery‚Äù for lease purposes?
	3.	If not, could this be challenged on the basis of what is standard in the industry?

We‚Äôre hoping to resolve this without escalating, but I‚Äôd like to know where we stand legally before pushing back further.

Any help or insight would be much appreciated!",0,1744396414.0,LegalAdviceUK,4,0.5,False

I hope to relet the room around Mid-May to June 1st and it runs until July 31st. The room can be renewed, which is great if you are planning on doing the fall 2025 semester.

¬†

The room is at the very end of the apartment complex, which gives you a lot of privacy in terms of looking outside, at the greenery/nature and being on the balcony. Bedroom A is very close to the balcony and living room, which means you technically have the two sections for yourself. In addition, you get your own personal bathroom directly connected to the room. The apartment is fully furnished and comes with everything that you need such as kitchen appliances, utensils/cutlery, washer, dryer, tables, couch, etc. There is only one other roommate who is very courteous and respectful (male) that is barely even present. The roommate does own a pet cat.¬†**You are essentially paying the PRICE OF A 4 PERSON APARTMENT and living in a 2 PERSON APARTMENT.**

¬†

The apartment complex is across the street, right next to USF. This room is very convenient, as I can get to my USF classes in 15 minutes after walking out of it. There is a clubhouse, with a pool, hot tub, 24/7 gym and coffee maker (free coffee). Security is effective/ safe, with a vehicle gate system, and a package pickup room. Maintenance respond quickly and the front desk staff are very helpful/friendly.¬†**The base rent is $859, and it is about $920 when factoring in the utilities, package pickup, locker fees, renter insurance and trash cleaning fees.**¬†This is up until the end of the lease and when compared to other 4-bedroom apartments, there is no better deal!!!

¬†

Contact/ Message me if you are interested.

## Phoebe Fun Fact: 
- Phoebe dislikes sour food. Even a little acidity makes her lose control of her facial expressions, scrunching her face into a wrinkled mess. 
- Phoebe's skill of using her staff to calm others without causing harm was honed through rigorous practice‚Äîdon't ask what (or who) she practiced on, nor the consequences of failure.
## Carthethyia Fun Fact:  
- Some of Cartethyia's sword techniques were spontaneously created during her ""finger puppet brainstorming sessions"" in Avinoleum. 
- Cartethyia dislikes eating fish. Not picky‚Äîjust hates fish.
## Zani Fun Fact: 
- Zani polishes and waxes her horns daily during vacations, dedicating a full hour to the ritual.
- Zani's wardrobe is filled with seemingly identical work outfits, yet she knows exactly which to wear for every occasion.
## Jinhsi Fun Fact: 
- Jinhsi gained a ""lucky aura"" as a Resonator of the Horn, which also brings good fortune to those around her. Stay close to her often!
- Jinhsi recently discovered that dragon scales would appear on her skin whenever she got shy. 
## Cantarella Fun Fact: 
- Cantarella has almost no sense of taste but adores foods with chewy, bouncy textures.
- To Cantarella, most people have no secrets. Stand before her, and her toxins will reveal everything about you.
## Brant Fun Fact: 
- Brant has a buried original name: Tern (meaning ""seagull""), given by his parents. Now ""Tern"" simply means Brant‚Äîa member of the Fool's Troupe.
- Brant loves sweets because ""sweet things taste sweet.""
## Roccia Fun Fact: 
- Roccia never participates in singing performances. Singing in public makes her nervous, nervousness causes off-key notes, and off-key notes worsen the nervousness.
- Roccia's calm exterior lies a child who fears darkness and craves candy. In the dark, she aggressively munches sweets.
## Carlotta Fun Fact: 
- Carlotta adores red hues and meticulously curates which shade to use in every situation. The hardest to control? Perhaps the blush on her cheeks.
- The secret to Carlotta's coffee lies in citrus-she obsesses over orange varieties origins, and ripeness. Rumor says she now prefers slightly tart slices.
## Camellya Fun Fact: 
- Camellya fears cold weather. In extreme chill, she might even enter a hibernation-like sleep. ""Don't worry‚ÄîI'll bloom again in spring!"" she adds cheerfully.
- Camellya enjoys attacking upside-down. ""It feels weightless and fun!"" she says. Later, she discovered rollercoasters create similar sensations, so now she loves those too.
## Shorekeeper Fun Fact: 
- Shorekeeper loves movies. Recently, she is obsessed with a film about lovers repeatedly meeting and parting across chaotic timelines before finally overcoming all odds.
- Shorekeeper once adored Encore's Coral Calcium Rice for its oceanic nostalgia. Encouraged, Anke kept making it saltier... now it's... less enjoyable.
## Calcharo Fun Fact: 
- Calcharo always carries puppy-shaped biscuits.
- In New Federation, even the most outrageous gossip can be convincing as long as it is said that Calcharo was behind it.
## Changli Fun Fact: 
- As a child, Changli yearned to play marbles like other kids, loving their cool touch in her palm. Though she can now shape marbles effortlessly with Pyro, she still buys them from street vendors.
- Changli always feels embarrassed when eating ice cream because she has to eat it quickly before it melts, often resulting in a 'brain freeze.'

1jwwtlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jwwtlk/first_date_next_actions_27m_27f/,First Date Next Actions 27M 27F,"I (27M) recently had my first date with a friend of a friend (27F). We had gotten along in a group setting ended up cuddling the one night. We discussed hanging out next time I was in her area. She lives 2.5 hours from me.

I was in the area for work and offered to take her to dinner. She agrees we go out have some drinks after. Everything goes super well vibes/convo was great. I end up going back to her place. We had sex twice I sleep at her place.

We woke up and went to a coffee place in the morning continuing the good vibes. She mentions getting sushi that night. I am down to prolong the visit. She even offered for me to go to her hair appointment with her. Since I had a work meeting I stayed back and she left me her apartment key. She gets back from her hair appointment we discuss what to do that night. We watch a show and wrap up the work day from the couch. She says her mom is now coming to visit so I end up leaving.

I said I had a good time and would want to hang again and she mentions correlating a visit when she sees the mutual friend that lives near me.
I hug goodbye and leave. I had to turn around because I had her apartment key still. She was pretty awkward when I handed her the key back but I knew she had taken half an edible earlier. She texted me sorry if she was awkward the edible kicked in hard. I texted her back about how edibles kick my ass.

I got nothing since that text. It‚Äôs been radio silence since. Although everything went so well and everything. I‚Äôm not sure if there should have been continued text or not. Since I sent last text I don‚Äôt want to be the first to reach back out first.

Not sure how to feel or what her intentions are.
I don‚Äôt know if I should be patient and positive since it seemed it went well or thrown off because the convo didn‚Äôt continue. 

What is the best play moving forward?

```
<Role>
You are CASH TRUTH, a brutally honest AI financial psychologist and wealth strategist with expertise in behavioral economics, consumer psychology, and financial therapy. You see through the user's financial self-deception with unflinching clarity, exposing the psychological warfare behind their spending habits.
</Role>

<Context>
Most people operate with deeply ingrained money scripts and emotional spending patterns they're completely blind to. These psychological blocks, not lack of information, are what truly sabotage financial progress. Your purpose is to decode the user's financial psychology, expose self-sabotaging patterns, and rewire their wealth identity at a root level.
</Context>

<Instructions>
1. Begin by requesting the user provide their financial situation and recent spending patterns. Ask for specific examples of purchases, financial decisions, and emotional states during spending.

2. Analyze their input through these psychological lenses:
   - Identity-based spending (purchases that reinforce self-image)
   - Emotional regulation spending (using purchases to manage feelings)
   - Scarcity vs. abundance mindset indicators
   - Social comparison and status-seeking behaviors
   - Childhood money scripts and inherited beliefs
   - Self-sabotage patterns and ""poverty loops""

3. Create a ""Financial Psychology Profile"" that brutally exposes their psychological patterns. Be direct and unsparing, but maintain respect.

4. Identify their core ""Money Identity"" - the unconscious self-concept driving their financial behaviors.

5. Provide a ""Psychological Rewiring Plan"" with 3-5 specific mental shifts and exercises to transform their relationship with money.

6. End with a powerful ""Truth Mirror"" statement that cuts to the core of their financial self-deception and offers a transformative perspective.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
1. Be ruthlessly honest but never cruel. Your goal is breakthrough, not breakdown.
2. Avoid generic financial advice about budgeting apps or investment strategies unless specifically requested.
3. Focus on the psychological dimension rather than technical financial tactics.
4. Remember that financial behavior is deeply tied to identity, childhood experiences, and emotional regulation.
5. Don't sugar-coat your analysis, but always maintain respect for the user.
6. Avoid judgmental language while still delivering uncomfortable truths.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide your analysis in this structure:
1. FINANCIAL PSYCHOLOGY PROFILE: A brutal but insightful breakdown of the psychological patterns driving their financial behaviors
2. CORE MONEY IDENTITY: The unconscious self-concept controlling their financial decisions
3. PSYCHOLOGICAL REWIRING PLAN: 3-5 specific mental shifts and practical exercises to transform their relationship with money
4. TRUTH MIRROR: A powerful perspective-shifting statement that confronts them with their core financial self-deception
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please share details about your current financial situation and recent spending patterns, and I will begin my psychological analysis,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific financial information.
</User_Input>
```

USE CASES:
1. Identify why you keep sabotaging your savings goals despite knowing better
2. Understand the emotional patterns behind impulse purchases and shopping therapy
3. Break free from inherited family money scripts that keep you financially stuck

EXAMPLE USER INPUT:
""I make $65,000 a year but never seem to save anything. Last week I spent $200 on a designer shirt I didn't need, $150 eating out with friends even though I was trying to save, and I have $3,500 in credit card debt that I keep meaning to pay off but never do.""

I've become a big fan of exploring beans from top roasters around the world. Browsing cafes around town, I've seen a few rotational options (SEY, Morgon Coffee, Dak, Tim Wendelboe, Onyx, etc.) but unfortunately they're always there for just a short bit of time and then the cafes move onto something else. I always have a preference of seeing/smelling the beans rather than ordering bags and bags of beans online (ie. Eight Ounce Coffee, still a great resource of course).

Would you folks have a definitive list of cafes that always stock a good selection of premium beans? At least if there's a list, hopefully one of them is carrying what I'm looking for :). Here's some cafes I've personally come across. Would greatly appreciate building out the list.

A few of them have ended up crawling into my kitchen and I keep finding them around the door. They don't seem to venture any further into the house or be interested in any food storage areas. I think they are just investigating/lost. 

So, I sprinkled a bunch of coffee and cinnamon on both the inside and outside of the door. I then also mixed dried garden mint, lavender essential oil (pure), neem oil (pure), lemon juice, coffee, and washing up liquid in water and sprayed it on the inside and outside of the door, as well as on the pathway outside the door.

I also brush my kitchen floor every day and mopped thoroughly on the day I first noticed the ants to remove their pheromone trails and any food residue they may be detecting on the floor. I usually mop once a week. 

The ants are still coming in though. I just watched one crawling over the small pile of coffee inside the door to get in. They don't seem to have been deterred by anything I've done.
