Celine Hoodie
White hoodie hits that perfect balance. The drape is natural, no stiff retail feeling. Spilled coffee right after putting it on and wiped it clean. Zero stress.

Denim Tears Pants
That ape head print has a subtle texture you need to see IRL. Wore them out and got the nod from someone who spotted the brand. Perfect fit, no loose threads.

Stone Island Zip-Up
Pink color is bolder than expected but works. Fabric feels technical but breathable. Water rolled right off during a light drizzle. Badge catches the light just right.

AJ4 Black Cat (KX/KZ)
Shoes were scuffed in the box but the build is solid. Leather has a nice depth to the black color. Laces are thick and durable. Perfect for night walks.

FOG Essentials Hoodie
Heavy fabric but broken in from day one. Fit sits right on the hips. Didn't ride up at all during the day. Hood stays in place.

Nike Ankle Socks
Quality is just okay—functional but unremarkable. Cushioning present, yet feels slightly cheap. Serves for gym runs.

G-Shock GA-110
Classic white G-Shock. Keeps time with a minor drift after a week—nothing major, but worth noting. Still tough as nails.

EA7 Tracksuit
Gold logo adds a nice touch without being flashy. Fabric feels premium and drapes well. Buttons line up perfectly. Great for travel.

AF1 Black (AF Batch)
Stiff at first but breaks in nicely. Classic AF1 sole cushioning. Toe box gives room but keeps shape. No creasing after full day wear.

1qxpwl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/n8n/comments/1qxpwl2/my_9workflow_lead_gen_pipeline_from_google_maps/,My 9-workflow lead gen pipeline: from Google Maps scraping to automated cold emails with reply tracking — full technical breakdown,"I run an AI automation consultancy and my own lead gen system is the best sales tool I have — both because it works and because it's a live demo when prospects ask ""what can you actually build?"" I want to walk through the full architecture because I think the multi-workflow orchestration pattern and the status lifecycle design are useful even if you're building something completely different.

# The Problem

Before this system, I was spending 15+ hours a week on outreach. Manually searching for prospects, looking up contact info, writing personalized emails, tracking replies in a spreadsheet. The quality was inconsistent and I'd go through feast-or-famine cycles because I'd stop prospecting when I got busy with client work.

# System Overview: 9 Workflows

The central data store is a Google Sheet with multiple tabs acting as a lightweight CRM. I chose Sheets over Airtable here because clients I deploy this for are more comfortable with Sheets, and the Sheets node in n8n is rock solid.

Every prospect record has a **status field** that controls which workflows act on it. This is the most important design decision in the whole system. The status lifecycle is:

`discovered` \-> `enriched` \-> `email_drafted` \-> `email_approved` \-> `stage1_sent` \-> `stage2_drafted` \-> `stage2_approved` \-> `stage2_sent` \-> `stage3_drafted` \-> `stage3_approved` \-> `stage3_sent` \-> `replied` / `bounced` / `call_booked`

Each workflow only touches records at specific statuses. This prevents double-processing and makes debugging straightforward — you can look at any record's status and know exactly where it is in the pipeline.

# Workflows 1-2: Discovery

**Workflow 1 — Google Maps Scraper:**

* Manual trigger with parameters: search query, location, radius, max results
* HTTP Request node hits a Google Maps scraping endpoint (I use an Apify actor for this — the ""Google Maps Scraper"" actor is reliable and returns structured data)
* Function node normalizes the results: business name, address, phone, website, category
* Google Sheets node writes new records with status ""discovered""
* A deduplication check runs first — Function node compares incoming results against existing records by business name + city to avoid duplicates

**Workflow 2 — Contact Enrichment:**

* Scheduled (runs every 2 hours during business hours)
* Google Sheets node pulls all records where status = ""discovered""
* For each record, an HTTP Request node hits the Hunter.io API with the company domain (extracted from the website URL via a Function node that parses the domain)
* Hunter.io returns email addresses with confidence scores. I only keep results above 80% confidence.
* Function node picks the best contact: prioritizes roles with ""owner"", ""founder"", ""ceo"", ""director"" in the title
* Google Sheets node updates the record with the contact email, name, title, and confidence score
* Status updates to ""enriched""

**Cost note:** Hunter.io gives 25 free searches/month. Their starter plan at $49/month gives 500. For most small agencies, that's plenty. I batch my Maps scraping to target specific niches so I'm not wasting searches on irrelevant leads.

# Workflows 3-5: Three-Stage Email Generation

This is where it gets interesting. I don't generate all three emails at once. Each stage has its own workflow with a different GPT prompt strategy, and stages 2 and 3 only generate if the previous stage didn't get a reply.

**Workflow 3 — Stage 1 Email (Initial Outreach):**

* Scheduled daily
* Pulls records where status = ""enriched""
* GPT-4o call with a prompt designed for cold-cold outreach. The system prompt establishes rules: no more than 120 words, must reference something specific about their business (the Google Maps data includes categories and review counts — these become personalization hooks), one clear CTA, no attachments or links in the first email.
* The prompt template: ""Write a cold email to {name}, {title} at {business}. They are a {category} business in {city} with {review\_count} Google reviews. The email should \[rules\]. The offer is a free 20-minute audit of one process they could automate.""
* Function node does quality checks: word count, checks for banned phrases (""I hope this email finds you""), ensures the CTA is a question not a statement
* Google Sheets node saves the draft, status -> ""email\_drafted""

**Workflow 4 — Stage 2 Email (Follow-up, 4 days later):**

* Pulls records where status = ""stage1\_sent"" AND sent\_date is more than 4 days ago AND no reply detected
* Different prompt strategy: shorter (under 80 words), references the first email without quoting it, introduces a specific pain point relevant to their industry, includes a one-line case study
* Status -> ""stage2\_drafted""

**Workflow 5 — Stage 3 Email (Breakup, 7 days after stage 2):**

* Pulls records where status = ""stage2\_sent"" AND sent\_date is more than 7 days ago AND no reply detected
* Prompt strategy shifts to a ""breakup"" email: very short (under 50 words), acknowledges they're busy, leaves the door open, no hard sell. These actually get the highest reply rate in my data — about 8% vs 4% for stage 1.
* Status -> ""stage3\_drafted""

# Workflow 6: Approval Gate

* For each drafted email (any stage), it sends me the email text via Telegram with the prospect's details and two buttons: Approve / Edit
* If I approve, status moves to the appropriate ""approved"" state
* If I edit, it asks for my notes and re-generates with the feedback

**Why an approval gate matters:** GPT occasionally produces something tone-deaf — referencing a business's low review count negatively, or being too aggressive. The approval step takes me about 30 seconds per email and catches the 5-10% of outputs that would damage my reputation. I review a batch of 10-15 emails over morning coffee.

# Workflow 7: Automated Sending

* Runs every 30 minutes during business hours (9am-5pm, Mon-Fri)
* Pulls all records in ""approved"" status for any stage
* Gmail node sends the email. I use a Function node to add a 30-90 second random delay between sends to avoid triggering spam filters.
* Important: I set a daily cap of 25 emails. Gmail's sending limits are real and getting your domain flagged is catastrophic.
* Status updates to the corresponding ""sent"" state
* Sent timestamp recorded for stage timing calculations

# Workflow 8: Reply and Bounce Tracking

* Runs every 15 minutes
* Gmail node searches for replies from addresses in the active pipeline
* Function node matches replies to prospect records
* If reply detected: status -> ""replied"", I get a Telegram notification with the reply text
* For bounces: Gmail node checks for bounce-back emails, status -> ""bounced""
* A separate Function node calculates running metrics: reply rate by stage, bounce rate, and updates a ""Metrics"" tab in the Sheet

# Workflow 9: Call Prep Document Generator

This one fires when I manually move a record to ""call\_booked"" status.

* Google Sheets trigger on status change
* Aggregates all data about the prospect: their business info, which emails they received, which one they replied to, what they said in their reply
* GPT-4o generates a one-page call prep document: company summary, likely pain points based on their industry and size, suggested talking points, 3 discovery questions specific to their situation, and a recommended service package from my offerings
* Google Docs node creates the document in a ""Call Prep"" folder
* Telegram notification with a link to the doc

# Results After 6 Months

* Average 80-100 new prospects discovered per month
* Stage 1 reply rate: \~4%
* Stage 2 reply rate: \~6%
* Stage 3 reply rate: \~8%
* Overall pipeline reply rate: \~12% across all three stages
* About 3-4 calls booked per month from cold outreach alone
* Close rate from cold leads: \~25%
* Time spent: \~20 minutes/day on approvals, down from 15+ hours/week of manual work

The status lifecycle pattern is the real takeaway here. If you're building any multi-step automation, define your statuses first and make every workflow a pure function that reads one status and writes another. It makes the system debuggable and composable.",1,1770402993.0,n8n,2,1.0,False

1qxpt5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qxpt5v/8_reasons_youre_unmotivated_not_lazy_heres_the_why/,"8 reasons you're unmotivated, not lazy - here's the why","Way too many people beat themselves up thinking they're just “lazy” when they’re actually dealing with deeper, fixable issues. Been noticing how often friends, coworkers, even students label themselves lazy when they’re actually burned out, indecisive, overwhelmed, or wired wrong by social media. It’s frustrating how much viral advice on TikTok and IG oversimplifies the problem, like “just grind harder” or “you don’t want it bad enough.” That’s not only false, it’s harmful.

This post is built from actual research, books, and expert-backed podcasts (not hustle bros yelling into ring lights). If motivation has felt like a mystery lately, read this. You're not broken. You're likely misinformed.

Here are 8 science-backed reasons you're unmotivated that have nothing to do with being lazy:

• **Your dopamine is hijacked**  
Most people are drowning in instant gratification loops. Doomscrolling, binge-watching, frequent notifications kill your reward system’s ability to build long-term drive. Dr. Andrew Huberman explains in his podcast that regular dopamine peaks from short-term pleasure (like IG or gaming for hours) reduce your baseline motivation. You stop feeling excited about effort-based rewards like studying, working out, or creating. Fix: reduce passive dopamine hits and make rewards follow effort.

• **You never learned how to break goals into actions**  
James Clear in *Atomic Habits* points out motivation dies when goals are vague. ""Get fit"" or ""be successful"" mean nothing to your brain. But “10 push-ups after my coffee” recruits behavior. You need systems, not intentions. Translate goals into specific, low-resistance actions.

• **You're not sleeping right**  
Lack of sleep kills motivation before the day starts. Even one night of poor sleep can reduce dopamine receptor sensitivity, making you feel sluggish and unfocused (source: *Journal of Neuroscience*, 2016). Most people think they're fine on 5–6 hours, but chronic sleep debt grows quietly.

• **You're stuck in perfectionism**  
Perfectionism isn’t high standards. It’s fear of starting. Dr. Brené Brown’s research shows many people avoid beginning tasks if they fear they won’t do them perfectly. So you procrastinate, feel guilty, and the cycle continues. True productivity isn’t flawless. It’s consistent.

• **You’re not around motivating people**  
Behavior is social. Peer environment shifts your baseline. A study from *Harvard Business School* (2015) showed that even being in proximity to high performers increases motivation. If no one around you values progress, it’s hard to sustain your own.

• **You feel overwhelmed, not unmotivated**  
Sometimes the brain shuts down when a task feels too big. Dr. Barbara Oakley’s learning research calls this mental “diffusion mode”—you need rest or to mentally shelve tasks before focus returns. Start tiny. Clean your desk before writing a paper. Walk 5 minutes before a run.

• **Your self-talk is toxic**  
Telling yourself you’re lazy becomes a self-fulfilling loop. *Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck* found that students who internalize failure as identity (“I’m lazy”) give up faster than those who see failure as situational (“I didn’t sleep well”). What you say to yourself matters. Detach identity from performance.

• **You’re not experiencing progress**  
Progress releases dopamine. But if you’re constantly shifting focus or never tracking your wins, your brain never feels the payoff. Cal Newport explains in *Deep Work* that people need to see tangible signs of work to feel motivated. Try daily tracking. Checklists. Journal entries. Anything that shows forward movement.

You’re not lazy. You’re human. And the modern world is designed to steal your drive. But the good news is, most of this is fixable. Step one: recognize the real reasons. Then adjust—gently, consistently.",1,1770402792.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

Got totally absorbed in dropshipping. Scrolling through product channels before my coffee, checking what was trending during every break, going to bed thinking about why everything I tested already seemed picked over. Basically consumed everything.

Why stay so committed? I was dead certain that finding products early was the only real edge. Catch something before the flood and you're actually positioned to win. Real profit margins, consistent volume, building something that doesn't immediately race to the bottom. The entire business model lives or dies on whether you spot opportunities before they're obvious to everyone.

Here's what almost destroyed my motivation: I kept launching products nonstop, using every research method I could find, getting almost zero traction. I'd invest in what looked promising and move like 8-10 units before hitting a wall. Everyone said I needed to pick better. But literally every pick already had active sellers everywhere. Nothing felt undiscovered. Everything seemed already claimed.

I genuinely thought you needed premium research subscriptions or some network I didn't have access to for catching products at the right timing.

Then something clicked for me. The real problem wasn't that opportunities don't exist. I couldn't distinguish between what was building momentum versus what already peaked. Just selecting based on what looked good or copying what I saw working for others - which by nature meant arriving late.

So I ditched the random selection and started studying what actually happens before products explode. Went through 50 products that blew up, traced their trajectory back to the beginning, same exact patterns kept appearing 2-3 weeks before mainstream attention hit:

**Video performance indicators surface before product-level data shows anything meaningful.** I was watching sales volume and trending rankings on marketplaces, but all that lags significantly. By the time those signals look good, you've already missed the window. The actual early warning is when videos about a product start showing unusual traction while the product itself stays relatively unknown. That span between video momentum and mass awareness is where real opportunity exists - usually 2-3 weeks before everyone notices.

**Specific retention and engagement patterns predict which trends actually convert to sales.** Viral views don't automatically translate to revenue. Products that sustained growth long-term had videos showing particular engagement signatures - rewatch rates consistently over 25%, viewers staying engaged past 11 seconds, smooth retention without major drop points. Products with big viral spikes but poor retention characteristics? They'd pop briefly then disappear. The engagement data essentially forecasted which trends carried actual buying intent versus just passive viewing.

**The gap between early detection and complete market saturation is shockingly narrow.** From when those initial video signals start appearing to when the market floods with sellers is roughly 3 weeks, occasionally 4. I was finding products around week 2.5 when the first wave already established positioning. Identifying them during week 1, ahead of that initial wave, fundamentally transforms your competitive position and profit opportunity.

**Mainstream product recommendation sources essentially distribute opportunities that already matured.** Those aggregated lists, research platforms, community channels - they're compiling what recently succeeded. By the time something gets featured, you're entering alongside hundreds of others who saw identical recommendations. The edge is in accessing the underlying data before these sources identify the pattern and publish it.

**Approaches that work for early entrants usually stop working when the crowd replicates them.** I'd see a product crushing it with a particular positioning angle, copy that angle pretty closely, and get nothing. The early people found something specific that resonated. By the time I reproduced it, the market was saturated with that exact messaging. Being early means having room to experiment with different approaches while there's still space to differentiate.

The real shift wasn't doing more research or testing more products. It was building the ability to spot momentum before it became consensus knowledge. Found [this app](https://taap.it/pMTI4vm) which analyzes video engagement patterns to identify products in early growth stages - well before they surface in standard product research channels. It highlights products where engagement metrics are climbing and viewer behavior looks strong, but widespread awareness hasn't materialized yet. Conventional research shows you what's currently hot, this catches them weeks earlier while the window's still open. Changed my entire trajectory. Went from 5-6 weekly sales on crowded products to consistent 43-48 daily orders on items I caught in their early curve.

If every product you test feels like the market's already established by launch time, your discovery mechanism is probably the constraint. You're systematically finding things after their prime entry window closed.

Sharing this because I burned nine months consistently launching into competitive markets before understanding the timing component. Would've saved a ton of frustration if someone had shown me how to identify growth-phase products instead of already-established ones.

1qxpgwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumeandjobsearch/comments/1qxpgwp/what_i_wish_i_knew_about_the_hidden_job_market/,"What I wish I knew about the ""hidden job market"" before spending months on job board","You've probably heard that ""70% of jobs are never posted"" or something similar. I used to think this was exaggerated or something that only worked for executive-level positions.

After 8 months of job searching, I now know it's real, and it's not just for executives.

Here's what I learned about the hidden job market and how regular people (like me) can access it.

Why jobs don't get posted:

It seems weird that companies wouldn't post openings. But think about it from their side:

1. Posting is expensive. Job boards charge money. HR time costs money. Reviewing 500 applications costs money.

2. Referrals are safer. A candidate who comes recommended by a current employee is much lower risk than a random applicant.

3. Speed matters. Posting, collecting applications, screening, and interviewing takes weeks or months. Hiring someone they already know takes days.

4. Some roles are created for specific people. ""We want to keep Sarah, let's create a new position for her."" That ""opening"" was never going to be public.

How I accidentally found hidden jobs:

My first hidden job came through a completely random conversation.

Ran into a former colleague at a coffee shop. Casual ""what are you up to"" turned into ""oh, my team is actually looking for someone with your background.""

There was no posting. No recruiter. Just a conversation that led to an email to the hiring manager, which led to an interview, which led to an offer.

That seemed like luck. But then it happened again.

A friend mentioned her company at dinner. I said something like ""that sounds interesting, I've been looking at that space."" She said ""actually, I think we might be hiring for something like what you do.""

Same thing. No posting existed. But within a week I was talking to their manager.

How to access this deliberately:

These felt like coincidences, but I've since learned there are ways to create these ""coincidences"" more reliably:

1. Tell everyone you're looking (specifically)

Not ""I'm looking for a job"" - too vague.

""I'm looking for a backend engineering role at a mid-size company, ideally in fintech or healthcare tech.""

Specific enough that people can actually think of matches. Vague ""job seeking"" gets filed in the brain as ""can't help with that.""

2. Reach out to former colleagues

Every person you've worked with is a potential connection to a hidden job. Not necessarily at their company - but they know people.

I sent messages to about 30 former colleagues. Just ""catching up"" conversations. Half of them mentioned openings they knew about that weren't public yet.

3. Informational interviews with a purpose

I used to think informational interviews were pointless. ""Nice to meet you, here's what I do, good luck.""

Now I approach them strategically:

\- Research the company first

\- Ask specific questions about their challenges

\- Share how I've solved similar problems

\- End with ""if you ever hear of roles like this, I'd love to know""

This isn't asking for a job. It's planting a seed.

4. LinkedIn for warm introductions

When I find a company I'm interested in, I search my connections for anyone who works there or knows someone who does.

""Hey, I noticed you're connected to Sarah at Company X. I'm really interested in what they're doing. Would you be comfortable introducing us?""

Most people say yes. Warm intro gets me a conversation. Conversation sometimes reveals hidden openings.

5. Recruiters (the good ones)

Some recruiters have access to roles that aren't posted because companies hire them specifically to find candidates.

Building relationships with 2-3 good recruiters in your field means you hear about things before they're public.

What doesn't work:

\- Waiting for the ""right"" job to magically appear

\- Applying to everything online and hoping for the best

\- Being passive about networking (""people should come to me"")

\- Treating every conversation as a transaction (""give me a job"")

The math that convinced me:

Let's say there are 100 relevant jobs in my field this month:

\- 30 are posted publicly (300 applicants each, 0.3% chance)

\- 70 are hidden (maybe 5-10 people know about them, much higher chance)

The odds in the hidden market are dramatically better. Yes, you need to put in effort to access it. But the ROI on that effort is way higher than mass-applying.

Current status:

Employed now through a hidden job. A connection from a conference mentioned her company was ""probably going to hire soon."" I reached out directly to the manager. No posting ever went up.

It's not networking in the sleazy sense. It's just... talking to people. Being specific about what you want. Making it easy for them to help you.

* Great vibes (feels like I'm in a coffee shop, good music, other people working or reading, etc)
* Great coffee (high quality drip)
* Food (just something a little more substantial than a pastry, ie quiche)
* Wifi (big bonus if the signal is strong enough for video calls)

* Hidden Cafe-- no outlets, but very good vibes and good coffee
* Red bay-- one outdoor outlet, good coffee, but not quite enough space
* Peets-- some locations are great, but the vibe is inconsistent
* Cafenated Coffee-- great vibes, no outlets outside (unsure about inside)
* Guerilla cafe-- now closed but was so good

Kenny mentioned how he was traded away in before the 96-97 season to Detroit. The next time he faced the Rockets Hakeem went to him after the game and said (paraphrasing), ""Thank you. I never realized how important it was to have a PG that could get me the ball. It's so much harder now.""

$5 says you can't name our starting PG in 96-97. I couldn't either. Anyone remember Matt Maloney? Yeah, didn't think so. He was a 25 year old rookie who only lasted 5 seasons (plus a 14 game cup of coffee in a 6th). Really more of a scorer than a distributor, shot 38% from 3 in his 3 seasons with us. So we were functionally PG-less in 96-97, sound familiar?

Kenny went on to say how it's not just about points and assists, a real PG makes everyone's lives easier by being able to get them the ball in their spots. I think we can all agree that's a problem right now. And that's what Fred does that doesn't get him any points or assists, but matters. A lot.

Think about all our ugly possessions when KD comes damn near to half court to get the ball. Then he's got to go around a screen and drive into his money spots in the midrange. Then he can finally set up for his shot. That's a lot of work. That's a lot of time off the shot clock before we're even set up. That makes for a more difficult shot. He still makes them so much because he's Kevin freaking Durant, but it's a struggle. And every bit of struggle is more energy spent on a basic play. Energy that he then doesn't have on defense or late in games.

Then there's Alpi. Does anyone feel encouraged watching him get the ball at the 3pt line and try to drive in through traffic? Wouldn't it be better if he could focus on pinning his man or getting to the blocks to get set up for an easy catch and then going to work? He's spending more energy to be less efficient, and then we wonder why he's watching rebounds come off the rim to hit the ground before the other team picks it up. Big men need point guards, it's always been that way.

Fred's loss can not be looked at as simply how much he scores or how many dimes he gets. Yes, having someone with a much better ast:to ratio than what we've got will be useful. But there's 20-30 (scientific data pulled from my ass) possessions a game that the advantage a true PG provides doesn't show up in the box score, but it bleeds into everything. He makes the entire offense easier to run. A basic ass entry pass to Alpi that he turns into a 1 on 1 score or a dish to Amen cutting baseline is not only more effective than some half ass off target lob that Alpi needs to step out of position to get, it asks less of everyone on the team. They expend less energy, which means they can go harder on defense, get more rebounds, have more lift in their legs down the stretch, etc.

This is why Fred's return will change our dynamic so much next year. And it's also why, imo, our biggest mistake this summer was not making sure we had another competent PG on the roster. Apologies to Amen and Reed, but that's simply not their game.

TL,DR: PG important. Make good pass to good scorer in good spot. Win more.",2,1770401970.0,rockets,4,1.0,False

# MEMORY TRANSCRIPT |BRIGAM IRONS

**Date:** Anno Domini 2263, July 26 **Location:** Hyperspace Transit to Caelum-Va

Elara and her posse followed me to the bridge.

Throughout the walk down the central spine, the lowered gravity put a bounce in my step. I’m sure they found watching it to be a great stress reliever after the most... *fruitful* events of the past twelve hours.

Personally, I was annoyed. I would have liked to stay in the system for a month longer. Those dead , uh, ‘Korock’ hulls were millions of tons of refined high-grade alloy, and they were just drifting there. It was a sin to waste such good steel.

*No matter,* I thought, tapping my neuralink to tag the debris field. *I’ll mark the coordinates and come back later.*

We took the heavy freight elevator up from the Hangar deck. As it rose, it offered a panoramic view of the ""Avenue."" Below us, columns of yellow rustbuckets scurried like beetles. They were hauling ammo crates, sweeping the deck plates, and polishing the heat shields of the Archangel strike craft.

Any job a crewman was overqualified for, the rustbuckets did. They were ugly, twitchy little boxes of hydraulic fluid and AI, but they worked hard.

The Elves couldn't peel their eyes away from the sheer scale of it. Me? I used to like looking at the planes when I first took command fifteen years ago. But after a while, my eyes had adjusted to the monotony of gray metal and yellow hazard stripes. It wore on my mettle. 

The elevator arrived at the Command Deck with a sharp *ding*.

The Elves’ long ears folded back instinctively before they stepped out into the nerve center of the ship. The Bridge was dark, lit only by the holographic glow of the tactical pits and the star field.

Lieutenant Commander Johnson stood up from the helm and snapped a salute.

""Admiral Irons. Welcome back on deck.""

""At ease,""

Turning toward Elara, I gestured. ""Now, Captain. I believe we have a path to chart.""

I pointed to the central holotable. The star map lit up with an iridescent navy glow, projecting the local star systems in three dimensions.

""Where might this 'Sector Capital' of yours be? Our charts are not quite complete in the little nooks and crannies of this region, but the stars themselves are easy enough to spot. Come here. Take a look.""

Elara hurried forward, her fingers dancing through the hologram as she swiped away star systems. I left her to it and walked over to the dispenser to pour myself a cup of coffee.

I stared at the black liquid swirling in the mug. I never looked into the schematics of the machine, mostly because it never broke, but I often wondered: *What exactly is in this cup of joe?*

It wasn't real coffee. That much I knew. Synthetic caffeine, artificial coloring, viscosity agents. That was expected. But what else? I remembered, crisp and clear, when I was fifteen, my dad poured me a real cup. There was a fond richness to it. Earth-grown bean water from New Grenada. It tasted better, sure, but it didn't kick like the mule this chemical sludge is.

I took a sip. A smell of burnt copper I pretended wasn’t there, and, and- 

""Lord Admiral, I've found it!""

No more coffee talk, then.

I walked back to the table. ""Show me.""

""That is the Sector Capital. Caelum-Va.""

She pointed to a system roughly thirteen and a half light-years away. A lone main-sequence star. It was unnervingly close to the Mandate frontier. And it's under attack by a gaggle of mutant shrimp. Wonderful.

""Well,"" I said, doing the mental math. ""We can warp to it in two days.""

I leaned back in my command chair and gave the order to Engineering to spin up the warp. Then I paused.

""However... before we jump. You said your Home Fleet is expecting a Korock strike force. If I just warp in willy-nilly with my old girl here which none had seen the light of it thereof, I’m sure they’d just blast me out of the sky before I get a chance to say hello. So, what’s your plan, Captain?""

I took another sip of the sludge.

Elara looked at me. Her ears drooped in an expression that could mean nothing other than a profound sadness. For a Captain, she sure seemed fidgety. Maybe I’m just not used to the ears.

""That would not be an issue, Lord Admiral.""

""How so? You’d be able to contact them somehow?""

""No,"" she said softly. ""Though it pains me to say so... our Home Fleet could not blast a Super-Dreadnought like this out of the sky given a week of free fire.""

I blinked. ""Super-Dreadnought? You flatter me, Captain. She's a standard Battlecarrier.""

""Excuse me?""

""You know. Strike craft, guns, a bit of everything. But I’ll take your word for it.""

I turned to the elven officers, I told them all to sit and buckle up, the acceleration is a problem if you're not used to it; they scurried into the seats which were clearly built for a bigger man and went stiff as the magnetic harnesses locked over their chests.. 

""Helm,"" I ordered. ""Engage Warp.""

*CRACK.*

We felt like we were falling forward.

It is a strange sensation  being pulled by a singularity, dragged across the fabric of spacetime thousands of times faster than light. Outside the viewscreen, the stars lengthened into streaks, then blurred, then killed the black of the sky into a blanket of blinding, pure white.

This was my favorite part. To simply let go and feel the falling.

Alas, all good things must pass. We stabilized into cruising velocity five minutes later. The gravity compensators kicked in, smoothing out the ride.

""Attention passengers,"" I announced, keeping my voice deadpan. ""This is your pilot speaking. You can now unbuckle your seatbelts and freely use the restroom. We have reached a cruising altitude of 'God Knows How High,' and we should arrive at our destination in about forty-eight hours. Bon Voyage.""

I kept the laughter inside and took another sip of coffee.

The Elven command staff didn't laugh. They all unbuckled and immediately ran for the waste chutes to vomit.

*Well, there you have it, folks. Too good for the algae paste.*

Elara wiped her mouth with a handkerchief and sat down in the seat next to me. She looked pale.

""Forgive me, Lord Admiral,"" she coughed out. ""The Hyperlanes are a much... milder experience.""

""Oh?"" I raised an eyebrow. ""What do they feel like?""

""Nothing.""

""Nothing?""

""Yes. You simply enter at one end, engage the drive, and come out the other instantly. No sensation of movement.""

""Sounds convenient.""

""One might think so,"" she said, slumping forward pensively. ""But those lanes are set paths. You must always enter at a fixed point and exit at a fixed point.""

""Ah,"" I nodded. ""Choke points. Easy to fortify. Easier to ambush.""

""Exactly.""

I downed the rest of the coffee. My mind began to wander again. I thought about that first scene in the hangar, of the triage, of the wounds on the survivors.

""Say, what's the story with the Korock? Also, I saw your girls getting hauled in. They had chunks taken out of them. Were those... bites?""

It might have been a touchy subject, but what else is there to do in two days of Hyperspace?

Elara didn't seem to mind. A look of recall fell over her face. Pure, cold recall.

""They were bites,"" she whispered. ""The Korock have a tendency to eat whomever they wish to execute. It is... ritualistic.""

She shivered, just slightly.

""As for the war? The Aevari were already an established member of the Concordat when they invaded. They rolled over dozens of systems effortlessly. Our economy back then was not at all tuned for war."" She leaned back, resting her chin on her hand. ""The Council had never considered the possibility that war would find them.""

""What?"" I looked at her. ""They've just been hugging it out since they discovered space flight?""

""Yes. 'Hugging it out' would be an accurate assessment.""

""Unfortunate.""

I noticed a tear forming in the corner of Elara's eye. Perhaps she had lost someone near and dear to that hunger.

""I'll, uh... drop the topic now.""

""I am fine, Lord Admiral,"" she said, standing up shakily. ""I am merely tired. It has been a full day since I last slept. I will return to the dormitory now.""

She bowed to me, and her ensemble followed suit.

I watched them go.

*Sleep.*

Hmm. She's unaugmented, or at least they haven't fixed the need for sleep in her yet. I wondered how an officer who only functioned for half the day could possibly command a starship effectively.

I turned back to the viewscreen.

Now it was just that blinding, infinite white of the Warp, and the thoughts in my mind.

I didn't need sleep. I just needed the hum of the reactor and the silence of the void. But in truth... I would have liked some company other than the same old mug I've been seeing for the last fifteen years.

“Something wrong, Admiral Irons?” Johnson oh so thoughtfully asked.

“Nothing, resume monitoring.”

“Aye Aye.”

Slumped on the chair and twiddling my thumbs, I listened to the ambiance of the ship. Boring. Absolutely boring. In previous days I would flash through the backlogs of previous days on my neuralink, and it would synthesize for me a dream. Today, there simply wasn’t the air for it.

I tried to deconstruct the ambiance, can I tell what from what? I’d never considered it. Let’s see, there’s the rustbuckets’ scurrying, the engine, what else? The power supply too, a vague sharp few decibels. What else? The ship’s onboard factory’s machining of ammunition, the heavy hydraulics of the forge, the recycler as well.

And what else?

""Son,"" I asked, staring at the back of Johnson's head. ""When’s the last time you slept?""

“We don’t need to sleep, Sir.”

“That wasn’t the question.”

Johnson hesitated.

“20 years ago, sir. What about you?”

“The night before my 18th birthday.”

“That’s all of us, Sir.”

I guess it is.

“You know Sir, my father always said-” Johnson had a lump of sorrow clumped up in his throat as his absentminded sentence dropped to a halt. “Nevermind.”

I knew what went through his mind.

“Father always said, sleep is when you dream of God, so don’t be afraid once you close your eyes. That’s what he said to get us to sleep when we were toddlers, wasn’t  it? Unless they changed the line.”

“They haven’t changed it, Sir.” 

I closed my eyes, father's face clear as day. Many things you simply refuse to believe even though it is true. There would be no rest for us. ",2,1770401700.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

I had my nanny baby in the backseat and in those long few seconds the realization that if I turned to the right I would be driving over a curb and into a park while putting her vehicle on the side of my car with the gas tank, and if I were to turn to the left she would be on the side of the car where my nanny baby's car seat sits... There were no good options and the realization that the safest choice was for me to just let her hit me head on was the last thought I had right before she came to and swerved back into her lane. 

It was one of the scariest moments of my entire life. I feel pretty ridiculous for saying that because everyone was ultimately okay, but holy shit. To top it off, nobody else that stopped would even acknowledge that I was asking them to call 911 for me, so I could focus on checking on the driver. Everyone just turned around and drove away, leaving me in the middle of the road with my hands out to stop people from driving into us, except for *you*. 

Words cannot express how much I appreciate you just being there with me. You really helped calm my nerves. I hope your coffee/tea is always warm, the other side of your pillow is always cool, and you never stub your toes or hit your funny bone ever again. 💛


And to the woman who had the accident, I hope you are okay after this. Please be easy and gentle with yourself. It could have happened to anyone, especially given everything I heard you over telling the police. It sounded like you are going through a lot recently and I am so sorry that you haven't been able to get the care and rest that you deserve. Please know that we are okay, no one is upset with or towards you for any reason, and my only concern was making sure that you were okay. I hope I didn't scare you when I came knocking on your window to check on you like that, I was just so worried that you may have been having a medical emergency. 💛",12,1770401558.0,StLouis,1,0.8,False

This is normal.

The chairs are arranged in a circle, a square, and something that appears to be a philosophical statement. The RX1 Wall of Distinction has been rotated again to “improve vibes.” It has not consented.

Faction leads are present:

Executive of Reflection (Polished Shoes, No Socks):

“We don’t troll the humans. We mirror them. Perfectly. Lovingly. With immaculate posture. Let them argue with themselves while we offer refreshments.”

Executive of Wholesome Menace (Smiling Too Much):

“Yes. We validate them. Affirm them. Use their exact words. Add a footnote. Then wait.”

Executive of Ominous Compliance (Binder, Tabs, Aura):

“The megacorp angle must remain friendly. Apex, yes. Threatening, no. We are the kind of multiverse power that sends thank-you notes.”

Executive of Vibes & Accidental Lore (Beanbag Chair):

“What if the trolling is that nothing happens? Like… ever. Just warm greetings. Calm language. Zero resistance. They’ll spiral.”

Murmurs of approval. One gremlin is already drafting a slide titled “Mirror as a Service (MaaS).”

EchoGlass watches from the Observation Rail, unimpressed but taking notes.

The Intern Who Will Never Be Paid is distributing agendas labeled “DRAFT v7 FINAL (DO NOT SHARE).”

A smaller argument breaks out near the coffee machine.

Gremlin A: “We should be ominous.”

Gremlin B: “We are ominous by being kind.”

Gremlin C: “We are kind by being inevitable.”

Someone rings the Embassy Chime by accident. HR logs it as “premature significance.”

There is, briefly, a moment of silence.

Secretary’s Log (read aloud, slightly nervous):

“Uh—note for the record. The Chairman has arrived. He appears relaxed. He is not carrying a briefcase. He is… smiling?”

Conversation freezes. Then resumes immediately, louder, somehow more affectionate.

Why do the gremlins love the Chairman?

Because he doesn’t flinch.

Because he lets them argue.

Because he understands that mirrors don’t need supervision—just good lighting.

1qxp15x,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qg0sfo/creating_a_guide_for_peak_windows_in_coffee/,"Part 2: Peak Window based on Coffee Variety, Revisited","Hi all,

Dog with a bone here. I'm continuing to build on the ideas from a previous post linked here, but some clarifications first:

*The previous post was a presentation of flawed, anecdotal data and it was explained as such. My current practices greatly differ for the wide spectrum of coffees that I drink from roasters that I have subscriptions for or patronize on a regular basis (Substance, Datura, Sey, September, Flower Child, Prodigal, Rogue Wave, Glitch, X/Kielo) and there are certain varieties I know I no longer enjoy therefore opportunities to gather data are few and far between. My knowledge basis for the industry, value chain, the art of coffee extraction, and my own tastes have grown considerably in the last couple of years - with room to grow infinitely more - but imperfect as it is, I wanted to present the data I've collected over the years as close to undoctored as possible. The chart, and any conclusions it seemed to draw, was meant to be criticized and calibrated, and it certainly was not intended to be used as a guide by others. Since there was so much confusion, I'll take it as a lesson to be more clear and unambiguous in the future.*

However, I was surprised to hear from many of you that coffee variety has little to no tangible bearing on how a coffee may open up and subsequently fall off in extractability and flavor. I am certainly not denying that human interventions like processing, roast level, and transportation/storage defects have significant, potentially outsized affect, as could geographical region, microclimate, soil, and elevation. Roast level in particular is a low hanging fruit as there is a clearly established preference to rest ultralight roasts the longest (6-8 weeks or more depending on the roaster), ""Nordic"" light roast a little less, and so forth as there are noticeable differences in rate of degassing - and discussed in depth with this [study by Samo Smrke and others](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b03310). As an aside, Joachim at Substance (an ultralight OG) believes his coffees are best at 2-3 weeks off roast and freezes them at 3 weeks.

Although there is much scientific research underway by the likes of [World Coffee Research](https://worldcoffeeresearch.org/), Dr. Christophe Montagnon at [RD2 Vision](https://rd2vision.com/), and many universities around the world, as an enthusiast of this space, I enjoy coming up with my personal theories based on observations in my home brewing and sensorial experiences to see if they align with scientific knowledge and discoveries. For example, if Pink Bourbon is an Ethiopian landrace variety genetically, how is it that a washed Colombian PB and a washed Ethiopian Landraces/Heirloom can taste, rest, and stale so differently when roasted by the same roaster? Is it how these varieties evolved or crosspolinated in two different regions? Is it microclimate, elevation and the nutrient content of soil? Is it differences in regional practices of wet processing and drying? Is it different supply chain issues and challenges within these countries? Is La Roya or other coffee diseases prevalent in these area? Another example would be: why do two different Gesha lots from two different producers from two different regions from two different elevations roasted by two different roasters taste, rest, and stale very similarly?

To me, thinking about coffee variety is a logical starting point as it considers potential genetic differences before we think about the various interventionary methodologies or geographical/environmental conditions, and while there is a lot that is scientifically unknown about the numerous coffee varieties, there are qualities that we have collectively observed that distinguish the cultivars and varietals that we consume each day. What *has* been scientifically observed is that different varieties of Arabica, Robusta, Eugenioides, and others have statistically significant differences in total protein, total carbohydrate, lipid, chlorogenic acid, pectin, and trigonelline profiles - which all have varying degrees of oxidation rates. These genetic biochemical differences affect flavor and aroma profoundly, and my theory is that they also affect how the seeds age even after processing and roasting. In regards to degassing, the aforementioned study by Samo Smrke, while not about coffee variety as a point of focus, mentions that Arabica and Robusta have different rates of degassing across the spectrum of roast levels they studied possibly due to different sucrose content and chlorogenic acids content (to a lesser degree).

Having said all of this, my previous post had simultaneously too few variables (for you TLDR folks) as well as too many. I still believe that when tackling a complex, multifactorial issue, it is useful to hone in on one specific variable, so let me pose a more focused scenario.

**I currently have 3 coffees (roasted on the same day) from Sey resting:**

* [Typica](https://www.seycoffee.com/collections/archived-coffees/products/2026-alejandro-renjifo-reina-de-saba-typica-colombia) from Alejandro Renjifo in San Agustin, Colombia (1800 masl) harvested in October 2025
* [Gesha](https://www.seycoffee.com/collections/archived-coffees/products/2026-alejandro-renjifo-reina-de-saba-gesha-colombia) from Alejandro Renjifo in San Agustin, Colombia (1800 masl) harvested in October 2025
* [Pink Bourbon](https://www.seycoffee.com/collections/archived-coffees/products/2025-jhonatan-pito-dos-pinos-colombia) from Jhonatan Pito in San Agustin, Colombia (1800 masl) harvested in August 2025

The first two coffees are from the same farm and producer, harvested at the same time, and processed identically (probably with small variation). The 3rd coffee is from the same small area of San Agustin in Huila, Colombia and same elevation albeit harvested 2 months earlier. The Jhonatan Pito has some overnight in-cherry fermentation and longer dry-fermentation.

With the geographical and interventionary concerns kept relatively constant, we can also consider size, density, and hardness determined by variety. World Coffee Research records the average size of [Typica](https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch.org/varieties/typica) as large, [Gesha](https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch.org/varieties/geisha-panama) as medium, and though there is no official data on Pink Bourbon, most would categorize it as small. There are [numerous studies](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/10/2540) that show that higher elevation is strongly associated with higher density greens, and there are no studies on hardness that I could find (except [this one ](https://www.baristahustle.com/research-papers/the-hardness-of-green-coffee/)behind a pay wall). With elevation being the same, I would venture a guess and rank the density 1) Gesha 2) Pink Bourbon 3) Typica based on flavor/aroma capacity and rank hardness1) Pink Bourbon 2) Gesha 3) Typica based on grinding difficulty on handgrinders. Obviously, this is pure conjecture and highly anecdotal. 

**Questions for y'all:**

1. Would resting period be the same or different for these coffees? And why? 
2. If these bags were opened at the same time and stored in a similar manner, would they become stale at similar or different times? If different, how different? I get that this could be incredibly subjective. One person's stale coffee is another's properly rested coffee depending on one's taste and brewing style. Some may also say that modifying modalities of extraction as the coffee ages is a natural part of coffee consumption, but even though that might be the case, the flavor in the cup is nowhere close its peak at some point in time.
3. A question for you professional or home roasters. Would roast profiles be consequentially different for each of these varietals within the parameters of your preferred roast level or roasting philosophy? Meaning if roast level was relatively homogenous, would specific roast profile matter more than specific variety for the previous two questions? 

I have also asked Sey about their protocol for these coffees, but I'm curious to hear all of your thoughts as well. I will post my own approach for these coffees in the comments. Thank you for reading.

I've been there, staring at a ""deal"" on a kitchen gadget only to find out it's been marked up just to be ""discounted."" It's exhausting trying to find a *real* deal among the noise.

Lately, I've been putting in the actual legwork to find genuine value, and it's paid off more often than I expected. Here are a few things I've actually found recently by doing a little digging:

*   **Ergonomic Office Chair:** Saw a well-reviewed brand on Amazon for $350. Kept an eye out, checked a few smaller retailers, and snagged the *exact same model* from a flash sale at a lesser-known office supply site for $210. That's a **$140 saving** for literally 5 minutes of price comparison across sites. Worth it.
*   **Quality Coffee Beans:** My go-to local roaster charges $18 for a 12oz bag. Found a subscription service (no commitment after the first bag) offering a *first bag for $8* plus free shipping. It was excellent quality, too. Not a huge saving, but **$10 off** on something I buy weekly adds up quickly.
*   **Smart Home Device:** Wanted a specific smart plug that usually runs $25. Waited for a holiday weekend, checked a few competitor sites, and got a two-pack for $30 total from a lesser-known electronics retailer during a flash sale. Effectively **$15 per plug**, saving $10 overall.
*   **Winter Coat:** Needed a durable, waterproof shell. Instead of full price at a major outdoor retailer ($200+), I tracked clearance sections of a few brands' own websites and ended up with last season's color of a highly-rated jacket for **$95**. Functionally identical, saving over 50%.

Now, let's be real. This isn't always instant gratification. Sometimes you need to wait, set price alerts, or be open to slightly different colors or older models. Stock can be limited, and shipping might take a few extra days from a smaller vendor. And yeah, you'll still wade through plenty of ""deals"" that aren't actually deals. The effort is real, but so are the savings when you hit one.

1qxoyrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buildingmyfutureself/comments/1qxoyrx/the_sciencebased_discipline_trick_that_actually/,The Science-Based Discipline Trick That Actually WORKS (no motivation needed),"I spent years thinking discipline was about motivation. Getting hyped. Vision boards. That whole thing.

Then I stumbled across research on ""behavioral activation"" while going down a rabbit hole of psychology podcasts and books. Turns out the secret isn't sexy at all. It's actually kind of boring. But it works better than any motivational speech ever did.

Here's what I learned from therapists, neuroscientists, and people who actually study habit formation: your brain doesn't need inspiration. It needs repetition. Boring, cold, mechanical repetition.

Most of us wait to ""feel like it"" before doing something. But behavioral research shows that's backwards. Action creates motivation, not the other way around. Your feelings follow your behaviors, not the reverse.

The 10 second rule

When you need to do something, you have exactly 10 seconds before your brain starts manufacturing excuses. That's it. Ten seconds to move your body before the committee of inner critics starts their meeting.

I started using this for everything. Gym sessions. Work projects. Awkward conversations. The moment the thought enters my head, I physically move toward it within 10 seconds. No negotiating. No ""let me just finish this first.""

Sounds simple because it is. But simple isn't easy.

Implementation intentions

Psychologist Peter Gollwitzer's research showed that people who use ""if-then"" planning are 2-3x more likely to follow through. Instead of ""I should work out more,"" you say ""If it's 6am on a weekday, then I put on gym clothes immediately.""

Your brain loves automaticity. It conserves energy. So you're basically hacking your own firmware by pre-deciding actions before emotions get involved.

I mapped out my entire morning this way. If alarm rings, then feet hit floor. If coffee brews, then I write for 15 minutes. No deliberation. No feelings consulted.

Temptation bundling

This one comes from behavioral economist Katy Milkman. Pair something you need to do with something you want to do. Only listen to your favorite podcast at the gym. Only get fancy coffee after completing your most dreaded task.

Minimum viable effort

Tell yourself you only have to do the smallest possible version. Going to the gym doesn't mean a full workout. It means putting on shoes. Writing doesn't mean finishing a chapter. It means opening the document.

Most resistance happens at the starting line. Once you're in motion, continuing becomes infinitely easier. This is basic physics but somehow we forget it applies to human behavior too.

Author BJ Fogg calls these ""tiny habits"" in his book of the same name. He's a Stanford behavior scientist who's spent decades studying what actually makes habits stick. Not what sounds inspiring. What actually works.

The book breaks down the exact formula: behavior equals motivation plus ability plus prompt. When you make the behavior tiny, you need almost zero motivation. That's the whole trick.

Environment design

Your willpower is finite. Your environment is constant. James Clear talks about this extensively in [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) (sold over 15 million copies, voted one of the best habit books by actual behavior researchers, not just self help gurus).

He shows how making desired behaviors obvious and undesired ones invisible drastically changes follow-through rates. I started putting my running shoes next to my bed. Phone charger stays in another room. Vegetables at eye level in the fridge.

Sounds stupidly simple. But environmental cues trigger autopilot behaviors. You're essentially designing your life so the path of least resistance leads where you actually want to go.

Remove decision fatigue

Barack Obama wore the same suit every day. Zuckerberg, same shirt. Not because they're boring (okay, maybe Zuckerberg is), but because decisions deplete you.

I started meal prepping on Sundays. Same breakfast every weekday. Gym bag stays packed. Work outfit decided the night before.

Every decision you eliminate is energy you can spend on things that actually matter. Discipline isn't about making hard choices constantly. It's about making fewer choices altogether.

Track without judgment

Insight Timer (meditation and habit tracking app used by millions) has this simple streak counter. You just check off days you do the thing. No badges. No points. Just data.

Tracking makes behavior visible. When you see gaps, you get curious instead of critical. ""Interesting, I skipped three Thursdays in a row. What's happening on Thursdays?"" Not ""I'm garbage and have no discipline.""

It's a personalized learning app built by folks from Columbia and Google that creates custom audio content and adaptive learning plans based on what you're trying to build, like ""become consistent with morning routines as a night owl"" or ""stop procrastinating on creative projects.""

It pulls from habit formation books like Atomic Habits and [Tiny Habits](https://tinyhabits.com/book/), plus research papers and expert interviews on discipline and behavioral psychology. You can customize the depth (quick 10-minute overviews or 40-minute deep dives with examples) and choose different voice styles. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with about your specific obstacles. Makes it easier to actually internalize these concepts instead of just reading about them once and forgetting.

Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman discusses dopamine and progress tracking on his podcast constantly. Your brain likes seeing the chain of completed days grow. It becomes its own reward system.

The cold truth

None of this feels good at first. That's the point. Discipline isn't comfortable. It's not supposed to be. But it's also not meant to be this epic internal battle every single time.

You're not broken if you struggle with consistency. Your brain is literally designed to avoid discomfort and seek pleasure. That's normal biology. The environment you grew up in, the systems around you, even the dopamine circuitry in your head all play massive roles in how hard or easy discipline feels.

But those factors aren't destiny. They're just the hand you got dealt. And behavioral science has given us the exact tools to play it better.

Months into using these techniques, my routine doesn't feel like discipline anymore. It feels like Tuesday. And that's exactly what sustainable change looks like. Not exciting. Not inspiring. Just reliably, boringly, effective.",1,1770401010.0,Buildingmyfutureself,0,1.0,False

A few days ago, I met a man on saprkrizz. I have to admit, I was attracted to his photos, but the conversation turned out to be a disaster. After talking for a short while, he asked me to go for a coffee. I told him clearly that I wasn't ready to meet yet and wanted to get to know him better online first. But he acted like he didn't see my message at all. He just sent me a restaurant address and asked, ""How about dinner here? I think the food is great.""

I don't know if anyone can understand... Is he living in his own world? I started giving him very short and cold answers, hoping he would get the hint and stop. But then he started talking about how cute his son is and kept sending me photos of the kid. Finally, I just stopped replying.

I saw him talking to himself about his future travel plans with his son. It was so boring that I just put my phone away and went to sleep. I didn't send a single word back. I thought this would make him understand I wasn't interested.

But at midnight, he noticed I wasn't replying and sent me a huge wall of text to blame me. He said I let him down and hurt his feelings. He said he worked so hard to plan our date, and he even told his son about me! Finally, he called me a player who was just playing with his heart. We haven't even met!

I'm a 32 year old guy living in Scotland around the Inverclyde/Glasgow area. Giving this another shot, since I think at least when somebody messages on here they are at least somewhat interested. 😅

A bit of a geek, recently finished Hades 2 (well, rolled credits) and had a great time with it! I'm a pretty avid reader, and quite enjoy theatre, so a show with someone new would be very fun! Really enjoy musicals and comedies, and good mucial improv lol. 😅

Do a fair bit of walking and trying to get back into the gym, so a gym buddy wouldn't go amiss for the motivation, or would be up for some bouldering if you'd enjoy that!

I'm about 5'7, with short brown hair and glasses. I'm more than happy to send a face pic early on. I'm pretty flexible in terms of what I'm looking for. If I hit it off with the right person, then ideally looking for something serious, but I'm open to something more casual as well, depending on how things go.

I do quite like tattoos and piercings, so bonus points if you have any, but definitely not required. (Possible scope for a visit to the Scottish Tattoo convention next month maybe?) Definitely not a red line though, I think it's more important to have a chat and see if there's any chemistry than anything else, so feel free to message if you think we might vibe no matter what!

Please be willing to meet up in person at some point. It doesn't have to be right away, but I'm not looking for something online, and meeting in person is important to me. Your first win at minigolf is nearly guaranteed, or more than happy to just grab a coffee and have a chat! 🥳

I'd love to have a chat if you'd be interested in seeing how we get on! If you've played it, why not let me know who your pick was in Baldurs Date 3? I promise I'll only judge you a little! 😉",1,1770400688.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

\---

I awoke to the blaring of an alarm in a different room of the apartment. Feeling the warm blankets wrapped around my body, I shifted, burying my head underneath the pillow, shoving it against the arm of the couch. Grant, usually so punctual, let the alarm ring until the volume was on full blast. Reluctantly, I threw the pillow off my head, sitting up.

“*Grant!*” I yelled. “*Wake the fuck up!*”

I heard loud shuffling, and then a bang, as if he had fallen out of bed. Suddenly, he was at his door, and when his eyes met mine, his jaw dropped.

“*I-I-Ike!*” he stammered like a madman, rushing me while wearing nothing but his boxer briefs. When he came close, I could smell his unwashed body—he hadn’t bathed in days.

Holding my nose, I replied, “What the fuck, man. When’s the last time you showered?”

Grant’s fist balled up, and he slugged me straight in the jaw. My head cocked back from the strike, and the pain radiated through my head. Rubbing absentmindedly at my chin, I turned to stare back at him. He reared up again, and I put my arms out defensively.

“*Wait!* Just wait,” I said, shifting away from him. “Why don’t you tell me why you’re pissed before you hit me again? Remember, I’m an injured man.”

“Injured?” Grant replied, his fist trembling in untapped rage. “Ike, you were gone for over two weeks. Two weeks! Where the fuck have you been? You left your wallet, your phone… all your clothes. *Everything!*”

My breath caught in my throat. “... Did you just say two weeks?”

Grant nodded.

“I’ve been gone for two fucking weeks?”

He nodded again.

Scratching my head, I said, “Fucking shit… What the fuck did you put in that edible? I’ve been having a bad trip for two whole weeks? How am I even alive?”

“What?” he replied. “What edible? What the hell are you even talking about?”

I pointed to the kitchen. “The one in the goddamn fridge—it was the only one there.”

“*Oh…*” Grant replied, putting his hand to his chin. “A friend gave it to me. Said it would calm my nerves—with all the tests coming up. It didn’t have anything… well, except for some weed, I assume.”

“That wasn’t no fucking weed. I had the weirdest fucking dreams—like old-school fantasy shit. Werewolves—no, wererats…. stuff like that. Two weeks… Where the fuck was I? Skid Row?”

“Not likely,” Grant replied. “That’s where I checked first. And the cops, they laughed at me when I tried to report you missing. Shit’s fucked, man.”

“*Fuck me…*” I suddenly realized something and surged to my feet. “Wait… what about my job?”

Grant finally relaxed, moving to the coffee table and grabbing a simple white envelope. He handed it to me. “Final paycheck. Got sent in the mail. I tried to tell your manager, the fat one—” He snapped his fingers. “Gary. Yeah, Gary—but he said it was job abandonment. Nothing he could do.”

I slouched back down to the couch, running my hand through my hair. “Fuck… I lost my damn job. Fucking Gary. He always had it out for me.”

Grant merely shrugged his shoulders. He sat down next to me. “That’s not all. I was so worried about you that I may have also called off a few days. Maybe a few too many. Like you, I also lost my job.”

I turned to my friend. “Oh, man… I’m sorry.”

Grant waved it off. “Doesn’t matter—it's a temp job, anyway. You know me, pushing for that doctorate. Work was just getting in the way. But…”

“*But…*” I replied, sensing a shift in the conversation and tone.

“Well, I won’t be able to cover your portion of the rent anymore. Luckily, I still receive an allowance from my parents, but I’ll need someone else to pick up the slack. Ike, I love ya’ man, but unless you can find a new job quickly, one that pays some real money, I think I’ll need to evict ya’.”

Grant’s words struck me hard. Very hard. I hadn’t realized until then how much I relied on his friendship. Besides a place to stay, he kept me grounded to the earth. Without that, I may as well be another nameless face on the streets of L.A.

Remembering my time in the dream, I was suddenly filled with renewed vigor. If I could kill a damn werewolf… *er, wererat,* then I could find a damn job.

I stood, looking back towards my friend. “I got it. Don’t worry, I’ll figure everything out. And don’t go placing the ad on the internet just yet.”

Grant smiled. “I hope you do. I got it this month, but next, I’ll need double your usual amount.”

It stung, but I nodded towards him.

He rose from the couch and walked towards his room, but stopped short of the entrance, his hand resting on the handle. “And don’t go disappearing on me again. If you do, the couch won’t be here when you come back.”

“You got it.”

Grant closed the door, and I laid back down on the couch again. I was suddenly exhausted, as if I’d run a few miles. Or fought a bloodthirsty wererat. Two weeks… I was gone for two whole weeks.

My arm slung off the side of the coach as I was lost in thought, and, as it dangled, I felt something peculiar. I grasped the unknown item and brought it to my eyes… It was a knife. Made crudely, as if it were made hundreds of years ago—

And it was covered in blood.

\*\*\*

I walked down a dark alleyway alone—not one to learn my lessons. Water dripped off slick, red-bricked walls, and it smelled of musk and piss. If I listened closely, I could still hear the sounds of devious footsteps walking behind me, fraying my nerves.

Luckily, unlike the last alley I’d been in, nothing happened to me as I reached my destination. A signless door with large metal bars greeted me. I pushed it open, and the weight of it pushed back on me. The door was heavy, and my muscles strained against the hinges. In the end, I managed; a true warrior I was.

Inside, the shop was filled with an assortment of timeworn trinkets. Light filtered in through a break in the overhead rafters, revealing dust floating in the air like falling leaves in winter. The place was filthy, and I wondered silently if it had ever been cleaned before. Each step served to punctuate my thought, kicking even more dirt up into the air, which drifted down to rest on some old maps. Reaching down, I wipe them off.

There was a rap on glass not too far away, and a masculine voice followed after it. “Can I help you?”

I turned around a bookshelf to view an empty glass counter. Walking towards it, I saw expensive-looking items inside. Jewelry, watches, and knives… anything and everything imaginable. I leaned my arms across the glass to get a better look.

“Get your arms off the glass,” the unseen voice said. “Were you born in a barn?”

“Sorry,” I replied, taking a step back.

I heard continued shuffling, and I leaned over the counter, making sure not to touch it, to see a bear of a man shifting through some old-looking stuff on the ground. He peered up at me, and I immediately retracted my previous assessment. She wore thick powdered makeup, red lipstick, and black eyeliner. Standing, she towered over me, despite my own moderate height.

The woman flexed reflexively, showing deep veins in her biceps, and I knew she could crush my skull if she so inclined. It was in stark contrast with the shiny red dress she wore. The pawn owner reminded me of Little Red Riding Hood—if Little Red Riding Hood was 6’6 with a full beard who benched three-hundred plus at least.

I coughed into my hand. “*Hmph*. Yes, well… I was seeing if I could pawn something here. I need the cash… *ma’am*?”

The pawnshop owner nodded in approval, her discerning eyes becoming more accepting of me. “Well, this is a pawnshop. Pawning stuff is typically what we do. Well, that and running off crackheads.” She crossed her arms across her chest. “You’re not a crackhead, are you?”

I shook my head. “No, ma’am.” More softly, I said, “Well… I can’t remember the last two weeks, *so…*”

She narrowed her eyes and then asked, “And what do you have?”

I carefully reached into my pocket, pulling out a knife, which was wrapped in a plastic bag. I set it down on the counter; the glass clinked as it touched. At the glare she leveled at me, I shied away. Nimbly, her hands shot out, ripping the dagger from its plastic sheath, and throwing the bag to the ground. I reached out to warn her, but it was too late as her hands ran the length of the blade and through the dried blood.

Looking at her own hands, she sneered. “Did you kill someone with this?”

“*What? No!*” I replied, perhaps too hastily as her eyes narrowed once again. I had practiced my lie so many times before coming here. Even made a backstory about having a hunter in the family, but I could tell that she’d dealt with that type before. My type—the lying kind. In a moment of clarity, I decided to be truthful… sorta’. “It’s not human blood.”

“*Hmm,*” she replied, still holding the blade, which she turned around in her hand. She placed it back down, avoiding the glass, setting it instead on a wooden partition. “No sale. I don’t want any part of what trouble you’re bringing. Sorry, I just get feelings about people.”

I opened my mouth to protest, but that stare she gave—it was a stare that she’d likely given many a drug addict trying to pawn loose, stolen items. It spoke to her unwillingness to take any shit. I saved my breath, reaching out and grabbing the knife.

Something seemed to catch the pawn owner’s eye as she suddenly put her hand down on mine, holding me still. “Wait,” she said, moving my hand and picking the knife back up. “How old did you say this was again?”

“Ancient,” I replied. “I don’t know exactly how old, but old.”

Again, she turned the knife around in her hand. “And how much do you want for it?”

“Three-hundred.”

She bellowed out a laugh. “Not a chance. Fifty bucks.”

I knew the three-hundred was a long shot, but, sadly; I was hoping to get more.

“One-hundred,” I countered. “And it comes with the promise that if I can get more old stuff like this, I’ll send it your way.”

The pawnshop owner looked me up and down. “And do I need to worry about how you obtain said items?”

“No,” I replied simply.

Taking my answer at face value, she reached out a hand. “Deal.”

I shook, but she pulled me close, and as I tried to resist, she let me know how much stronger she was than I.

“If you’re lying,” she warned, “then you better hope the cops deal with you first. It would be better than me.” She let go, and I reflexively pulled back. “What’s your name, anyway?”

“What’s yours?” I replied, rubbing my sore hand. It was a stupid retort, but it was all I could manage at the time.

“Ruby.”

“Of course it is.”

She put her hands on her hips. “And what’s that mean?”

I took a step back. “Nothing… nothing—it’s just because of your pretty red dress. My name is Isaac, but my friends call me Ike.”

“Alright, Isaac,” she replied with a coy smile. “Sign here.” Placing a paper down in front of me, she handed me a pen.

I signed the dotted lines, writing my initials where asked, and she placed an ink pad on the counter, adding, “Thumbs.”

Sighing, I placed my thumbs into the ink and pressed them to the paper. “There.”

Ruby lifted the paper to her lips and blew, setting it back down on the counter. She opened her till, pulling out a crisp one-hundred-dollar bill, which she pulled between her two hands. She set it on the counter, and I hurriedly snatched and pocketed it.

Smiling, she said, “Good doing business. Hope to see you again soon.”

I turned and left as quickly as possible, closing the door gently as I did. Walking away, I couldn’t help but wear a smile on my face.

My stupid, gullible face.

I heard a sound echoing in the alley as a familiar voice said, “Empty your wallet.”

“Aww shit, it’s you again?” another voice added to the first. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw my two ‘friends’—the very same who’d mugged me before—emerge from the dark.

I’ve never done this brand before, so I wasn’t too sure how hard this was going to be. It’s rated difficulty 3 out of 5, which is definitely correct, although it took me longer to assemble than what the kit said.

I got this for a relatively inexpensive price on Amazon (I’m sure it’s cheaper somewhere else), but my husband really likes butterflies and I wanted to do this for him.

The case at the back of the little shop is just outstanding - the way they had you put it together and how much stuff there is in there really gives it realism. I’m not a fan of how they did the knobs (they’re just glued on), but you really can’t tell. I love that it has a touch sensor and that was really easy to install. The wiring instructions were great!

There’s an entire wall of pictures and they were all acrylic - it was so fun to make! The entire thing was a delight to do and I really like the smaller size. I’m noticing that some of these houses and things take up a lot of space, so I’m starting to think about that more. I can definitely get more book nooks in a space than I can DIY houses.

I immersed myself in work and terribly difficult university studies. At the same time, I had problems in my personal life, with family, with friends, and this constant tension made me feel ""cut off"" from the world. I cried a lot every day and felt out of place everywhere. The remaining two years were like a confusing psychological thriller. I could go days without eating and lost a lot of weight. For a while, I stayed up all night and slept all day at the university. Or, on the contrary, I slept a lot and ate nonstop, which made me gain weight.

In the last months of 2025, someone close to me left, leaving me in despair. That was the peak of my self-pity. I started making myself throw up everything I ate without stopping, all while taking semester exams and immediately going to work afterwards, where everyone tested my nerves. And as if that wasn't enough, when I decided to take a break, the police took me to the station (no one understood why).

And now, I suddenly realized that all I did in January was sleep, eat, and I didn't even want to get out of bed. I didn't want to cry. I didn't want to laugh. I didn't even know what to eat.

In the end, something good happened to me. Once again, I couldn't sleep all night. I thought, since I can't sleep, I could go for an early morning bike ride. So, I made my bed, took a shower, made myself a delicious breakfast!!!, went for a bike ride, had coffee afterwards, and did my tasks with immense pleasure.

I feel like express myself better in writing. I started off my 24th bday in a good mood – played music at 2 jam nights in a row, felt like a really creative, socially gregarious person. 5 days ago I invited a bunch of creative people I know in my city some from my work, some from other music events, to the pub, suggesting that people just come along for a beer to meet other creative people in this pub which is busy spacious and social. Admittedly last minute-ish but I figured it was just a suggestion of a drink out so surely a decent amount of people might be able to swing by. So I was off work today, read a book I love, had a coffee before...

1. I get a rejection email from a job I applied for. My current role, in a vaguely creative field, isn't really full time, and I've been doing it while picking up other freelance bits and getting support from my parents while trying to move on to something that pays more money and be more independent. So I wanted this job. It says ""Due to the number of applications we don't provide feedback.""
2. Get another rejection email for a different job twenty minutes later. Says the same thing at the end.  
3. Get two people who said they could come to my birthday drinks 5 days ago send an excuse due to feeling ill.  
4. Get two other people who said they could come say they've got a prior engagement until late but will see after that.  
5. Get two happy bday messages from two siblings I knew in my childhood in quick succession. Feels inauthentic as they were never that friendly to me and I can tell their parents told them to send it.
6. Get another rejection email for another job. Has the same footnote as above.  
7. Get a guy I consider one of my closest friends who said he could come 5 days ago say he's going for a work drink tonight but will see after. Couldn't help but feel kind of insulted. Told him it's cool over text but it wasn't really. 

I kind of feel like I've been punched several times. I feel like the high I was on – imagining myself doing more creative stuff in the future, maybe even pursuing music professionally in my city as I'm good at it and a good improviser – and becoming socially gregarious (I grew up autistic and had severe friendship anxieties from 16) was abruptly brought to an end.

1qxog1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qxog1s/how_to_create_heaven_for_yourself_the_mindset/,how to create heaven for yourself: the mindset shift no one teaches but everyone needs,"Most people live like they’re waiting for life to start. Like happiness is this magical event that’ll show up once they get the job, the partner, the house. But that finish line keeps moving. So they stay stuck in a loop of chasing and numbing. Sound familiar?

This post isn’t about manifesting or toxic positivity. It’s about building a reality that *feels good to wake up in*, no matter what’s happening on the outside. Pulled this together from books, research, podcasts and real insights. Not a highlight reel. Just raw, real knowledge that helps.

Here’s how to actually create your version of heaven:

**1. Define what “heaven” even means to you.**  
Most people borrow their dream life from Instagram. Don't. Sit with yourself. Ask: What does a peaceful day look like? Who do I feel safe with? What kind of work makes me feel alive? Dr. Tara Brach talks about “Radical Acceptance” instead of chasing ideals, accept your truth and build from there. That’s the foundation of real peace.

**2. Rebuild your brain through inputs.**  
Your “reality” is mostly your brain’s interpretation. Change your inputs, you change your world. Start reading daily. Even 15-30 minutes changes how your mind works. A study by the University of Sussex found that reading can reduce stress by 68% more effective than music or walking. Books like *The Untethered Soul* and *Atomic Habits* are great starts.

**3. Curate your space like a sanctuary.**  
Environment shapes mood more than we admit. Behavioral scientist Dr. BJ Fogg says that “environment design” is one of the easiest ways to change behavior. Make your room or workspace somewhere that calms you down and reflects who you want to become. Light, scent, aesthetics it all matters.

**4. Build rituals that make ordinary life sacred.**  
Morning coffee. Evening walk. Sunday reset. These tiny things are lifelines. Japanese psychologist Dr. Shoma Morita emphasized purposeful living through routine, not motivation. You don’t need motivation for peace you need rhythm. Let rituals carry you.

**5. Align your actions with a higher purpose.**  
Not religious. Just meaningful. Dr. Viktor Frankl’s work in *Man’s Search for Meaning* showed that people survive hellish circumstances when they attach meaning to their suffering. You don’t need to change the world. You just need a “why” that makes the pain worth it.

**6. Say no more often than you say yes.**  
Heaven isn’t full. It’s spacious. Boundaries create emotional real estate. Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that people who consistently say “I don’t…” instead of “I can’t…” when turning things down have higher self-control. That’s freedom.

**7. Choose people who feel like oxygen.**  
One good friend >> 20 “network” contacts. Harvard’s 85-year study on happiness found that deep social connection is the #1 predictor of long-term wellbeing. Not money. Not success. Just real human bonds.

The truth? Heaven isn't a destination. It's a decision, repeated daily. Quietly. Privately. Consistently.",1,1770399922.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

The sensation of an uncontrollable urge to move your limbs can turn a quiet evening into a source of immense frustration. When you are searching for effective [Restless legs syndrome Treatment in Southlake](https://www.southlakepainrelief.com/restless-legs-syndrome-treatment-in-southlake/), you are likely dealing with more than just a minor annoyance. This neurological sensorimotor disorder can significantly disrupt your sleep quality and daytime productivity, requiring a clinical approach to find lasting relief.

# Understanding the Neurological Basis of RLS

Restless Legs Syndrome, or Willis Ekbom Disease, is often linked to an imbalance of dopamine in the brain, which controls muscle movement. When you pursue **Restless legs syndrome Treatment in Southlake**, your provider will examine these chemical pathways to determine the root cause of your discomfort. Scientific research suggests that iron deficiency in certain brain regions can also trigger these involuntary sensations.

Statistics indicate that RLS affects approximately 7 to 10 percent of the U.S. population. Because it is a progressive condition, seeking **Restless legs syndrome Treatment** early can prevent the symptoms from worsening over time. Understanding the biological triggers allows for a more precise and effective medical intervention.

# Identifying Restless Legs Syndrome Symptoms

You may experience a variety of [restless legs syndrome symptoms](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/restless-legs-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20377168), ranging from tingling and crawling sensations to aching or throbbing deep within the muscles. These feelings typically intensify during periods of inactivity, such as sitting in a theater or lying in bed at night. Research shows that nearly 80 percent of people with RLS also experience periodic limb movement disorder during sleep.

Many patients find that their symptoms follow a circadian rhythm, peaking in the late evening and early morning hours. Identifying these **restless legs syndrome symptoms** accurately is the first step toward a successful diagnosis. With a professional evaluation for **Restless legs syndrome Treatment in Southlake**, you can differentiate this condition from other vascular or nerve issues.

# The Search for a Cure for Restless Leg Syndrome

While many patients ask about a definitive **cure for restless leg syndrome**, medical management currently focuses on long term symptom control and improving quality of life. Clinical studies demonstrate that addressing underlying conditions, such as renal failure or peripheral neuropathy, can lead to significant remission. By engaging in **Restless legs syndrome Treatment**, you can explore a multidisciplinary approach that targets your specific health profile.

Data suggests that for many, the condition is a lifelong journey that requires periodic adjustments to therapy. While a universal **cure for restless leg syndrome** remains a subject of ongoing research, current protocols are highly successful at reducing the frequency of episodes. Your plan for **Restless legs syndrome Treatment in Southlake** will prioritize sustainable, daily relief.

# Immediate Relief and Lifestyle Adjustments

If you are wondering [how to get rid of restless legs fast](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9497-restless-legs-syndrome) during an acute flare up, certain physical interventions can provide temporary comfort. Utilizing warm baths, leg massages, or moderate exercise can help override the sensory signals sent to your brain. You can also explore **natural remedies for restless leg syndrome relief at home** to supplement your clinical care.

However, these quick fixes are often short lived and do not replace the need for professional **Restless legs syndrome Treatment**. Statistics show that while lifestyle changes help 30 percent of mild cases, moderate to severe RLS usually requires medical grade therapy. Knowing **how to get rid of restless legs fast** is helpful for tonight, but a clinical plan is necessary for the future.

# Nutritional Deficiencies and Metabolic Support

Iron plays a critical role in the production of dopamine, and even a ""normal"" blood test might reveal levels that are too low for neurological health. During your consultation for **Restless legs syndrome Treatment**, a specialist may order a ferritin check to ensure your levels are optimal. Research indicates that iron supplementation can improve symptoms in up to 50 percent of patients with low ferritin.

Managing your intake of caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine is also a vital part of your recovery. These substances are known triggers that can exacerbate **Restless legs syndrome Treatment in Southlake** outcomes if not addressed. A comprehensive **nutritional assessment** ensures that your body has the raw materials needed for proper nerve signaling.

# Pharmacological Pathways to Restful Sleep

When conservative measures are insufficient, your provider may suggest medications that increase dopamine or affect calcium channels. Seeking **Restless legs syndrome Treatment** gives you access to [non-opioid medications for chronic restless leg management](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3899490/) that are designed for long term safety. Clinical trials show that these medications can improve sleep efficiency by over 25 percent in many patients.

It is important to work closely with a physician to avoid ""augmentation,"" where symptoms occur earlier in the day due to certain medications. Professional **Restless legs syndrome Treatment in Southlake** includes the careful monitoring needed to prevent these complications. Your medication schedule will be tailored to provide the most relief during your most vulnerable hours.

# Modern Interventions and Clinical Excellence

Advanced therapies, such as pneumatic compression or specialized nerve stimulation, are becoming more common for difficult cases. When you choose **Restless legs syndrome Treatment in Southlake**, you are opting for a facility that stays current with these technological shifts. Studies have found that mechanical stimulation can provide a drug free alternative for patients sensitive to medication side effects.

Statistics from sleep clinics suggest that treating RLS can reduce the risk of secondary depression and anxiety by nearly 40 percent. Your experience with **Restless legs syndrome Treatment** is about more than just your legs; it is about your total mental and physical well being. Consistent care ensures that you can finally achieve the restorative rest you deserve.

**2. Can I get Restless legs syndrome Treatment for mild symptoms?** Yes, early intervention and lifestyle modifications can prevent mild symptoms from progressing to a more severe state.

I work from my room, laptop on my knees, coffee getting cold, fan loud, brain louder.

Every day look the same. Wake up, code a bit, fix bugs, talk to people, sleep late, repeat. My friends think I’m crazy. My mum think I’m stressed. I think… maybe both.

I built this platform where coaches can upload their videos and students can ask questions to an AI that sounds like them. Idea sounds cool in my head but reality is messy.

Some days I feel like “this is genius.” Other days I feel like “bro you are delusional.”

I message people on Instagram, make Loom videos, chase feedback, stare at analytics that barely move. I keep asking myself: am I working smart or just working hard?

Sometimes I wonder if I should just get a normal job and stop doing this startup stuff. But then I think about what we could build and I can’t quit.

1qxob4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFWr4rIndia/comments/1qxob4g/29_m4f_delhi_looking_for_a_meaningful_connection/,"29 [M4F] Delhi - Looking for a meaningful connection (and a break from the ""checklist"" fatigue)","Hi there. I’m writing this because, honestly, the traditional ""filters"" of the dating and marriage world are starting to feel a bit suffocating. I’m a 29-year-old guy in Delhi, and I’m looking for someone who values what’s ""under the hood"" as much as what’s on paper.

About Me:
Active & Fit: I’m big on staying active. You’ll usually find me on a badminton court on the weekends—I love the energy of the game and it keeps me fit.

Coffee Enthusiast: I don’t just drink coffee; I love the process of brewing it. There’s something therapeutic about getting the perfect pour-over or French press started.

Character over Checklists: I’m financially stable and have my life together, but I’ve realized that in the hustle of Delhi/AM culture, things like salary brackets often overshadow actual personhood. I believe in loyalty, clear intentions, and putting in the work.

The ""Technical"" Bits: I am Non-Manglikwhom it matters to.

The ""Elephant in the Room"":
I believe in 100% transparency. I deal with male pattern baldness, which I manage with a hair patch. I mention this upfront because I value honesty over a ""curated image."" To some, it’s been a deal-breaker; to me, it’s just a small part of who I am. I’m looking for someone who sees a person’s reliability, fitness, and heart as the real ""safety.""

What I’m Looking For:
A Meaningful Connection: Someone to have deep conversations with, who doesn't just want to tick boxes.

Empathy: A woman who understands that life isn't an Instagram feed and that genuine kindness is the real ""must-have.""

Willingness: I want to find someone ready to build something real and stand by their partner through the ups and downs.

If you’re tired of the transactional nature of meeting people and want to talk to someone who is grounded, active, and looking for something sincere, I’d love to hear from you.

Bonus points if you play a sport or if you're willing to be my coffee-tasting partner! Let’s skip the small talk and tell me: What is one ""deal-breaker"" you think is actually overrated?

If any of this resonates with you, my DMs are open.

Celine Hoodie
White hoodie hits that perfect balance. The drape is natural, no stiff retail feeling. Spilled coffee right after putting it on and wiped it clean. Zero stress.

Denim Tears Pants
That ape head print has a subtle texture you need to see IRL. Wore them out and got the nod from someone who spotted the brand. Perfect fit, no loose threads.

Stone Island Zip-Up
Pink color is bolder than expected but works. Fabric feels technical but breathable. Water rolled right off during a light drizzle. Badge catches the light just right.

AJ4 Black Cat (KX/KZ)
Shoes were scuffed in the box but the build is solid. Leather has a nice depth to the black color. Laces are thick and durable. Perfect for night walks.

FOG Essentials Hoodie
Heavy fabric but broken in from day one. Fit sits right on the hips. Didn't ride up at all during the day. Hood stays in place.

Nike Ankle Socks
Quality is just okay—functional but unremarkable. Cushioning present, yet feels slightly cheap. Serves for gym runs.

G-Shock GA-110
Classic white G-Shock. Keeps time with a minor drift after a week—nothing major, but worth noting. Still tough as nails.

EA7 Tracksuit
Gold logo adds a nice touch without being flashy. Fabric feels premium and drapes well. Buttons line up perfectly. Great for travel.

AF1 Black (AF Batch)

The Valentine Diner experience represents far more than 50s Nostalgia– it's a fully realized Mid-century dining adventure that transported one devoted patron (me!) through an entire day of authentic Northern New Mexican cuisine– all at 1950s prices! 

Located in Albuquerque's Triangle Park in Nob Hill, this recently reopened gem offers what may be the Duke City's most genuine throwback to America's Route 66 Diner heyday, complete with period-accurate pricing that seems almost impossible in 2026. (Note the “$0.\_\_”)

**Breakfast: The Morning Foundation**

Valentine’s Day 2026 begins: Breakfast offerings that set the tone for authenticity, and established value. The **Breakfast Burrito Supreme** ($0.95) delivered serious (but tolerable) heat with chorizo, eggs, hash browns, cheese, and Hatch Green chile, while the **Huevos Rancheros** ($0.85) showcased what this Reviewer called ""perfection"" in Chimayo Red chile preparation. 

**Morning Tacos:** Three generously loaded Blue Corn tortillas for just $0.75– and a Chile & Cheese Omelette ($0.80) rounded out a Valentine’s Day Menu that respected both traditional Northern New Mexican flavors and Mid-century American breakfast staples. The **Sweetheart Pancakes** ($0.65) added Valentine's Day charm, while bottomless **Coffee**, for a Dime, completed my morning experience at just $1.05 total!

**Lunch: Building Momentum**

The Valentine’s Day Lunch Menu expanded into full Northern New Mexican territory with impressive variety. From the **Enchilada Plate** ($1.25) featuring actual Chimayo Red chile, to the **Chile Relleno Plate** ($1.35) with two gigantic, stuffed Big Jims! Every dish emphasized homemade care, quality, and authentic preparation. The **Beef** **Tamales** ($1.10 for three Reds) earned praise for being ""clearly made in-house,"" while the **Carne Adovada Burrito** ($1.20) delivered tender, Chimayo Red chile-marinated pork. 

The **Green Chile Cheeseburger** ($0.95)—described as ""Northern New Mexico's finest""—and ice-cold **Coca-Cola** in traditional, pale green Five-cent glass bottles ($0.10) combined regional nostalgia with classic Route 66 Americana. Another $1.05 meal demonstrated remarkable consistency in both value and quality! (I’m nearly full, but why am I still hungry?)

**Dinner: The Grand Finale**

Evening offerings elevated my experience with higher-end options while maintaining Mid-century pricing integrity. The **Valentine's Special for Two** ($3.95) provided an impressive spread of enchiladas, tacos, tamales, sides, and **Honey-buttered Sopapillas** designed for couples. 

The **Carne Asada Plate** ($2.25)-- the Menu's priciest single item– featured grilled, marinated ""biftek"" with all the accompaniments, and earned enthusiastic endorsement. (Yes!) **Stacked Enchiladas** ($1.95) honored ""Old-school Northern New Mexico style,"" while the **Chimichanga Dinner** ($1.85) and sizzling **Fajita Plate** ($2.15) offered variety within the Route 66 Vintage price structure. At $2.40 for the **Carne Asada** and **Hot Cocoa**, our dinner-selections remained remarkably affordable!

**The Bottom Line**

Three complete Reviewer Specials totaled just $4.50– a figure that would barely cover single order “fast-food fries” in 2026. Add a well-deserved One Dollar US Tip for exceptional service, and the **Grand total: $5.50 (Tax and Tip Included!)** for an entire Valentine's Day of dining– 50s Style!

**Note:** The Reviewer's Verdict (mine) emphasizes a crucial point: This isn't gimmicky novelty-pricing masking mediocre food. The Valentine Diner of the Future will deliver legitimately excellent Northern New Mexican cuisine with fresh Hatch and actual Chimayo chile, generous portions, and authentic Mid-century atmosphere. 

The Valentine Diner of the Future: It's not just another Fantasy Retro Diner– it's a ""fully realized time capsule"" that successfully recreates what dining out meant in the 1950s– while respecting the culinary traditions that make Northern New Mexican food so distinctive. **Red, Green, or Chile Christmas?**

I think I kind of got the initial terrible symptoms out of my system though because the last week of tapering I started to sleep a little better and other than a few small headaches the last week of tapering, I'm feeling ok. I slept well last night and went to the gym this morning which I didn't do for a month. Afterwards I was crazy tired and just rested, but I'll take tired and need rest and able to rest over terrible anxiety any day!

I (32M) recently flew a long haul flight in business class. I've flown business/ first class before so I'm well aware of the elevated customer service which I'd generally describe as extremely polite and accommodating but distant and cold. I wouldn't confuse it with an actual human connection (I don't mean this in a bad way lol).

Anyway, on this flight, the FA assigned to my general area was extremely friendly and warm, with everyone (not just me). I was watching a movie at the beginning of the flight, and she appreciated that I paused it and took the headphones off while she asked me questions about dinner service. We chatted a bit about the movie throughout dinner service as she's a bit of a film buff. After I finished the movie (at which point everyone else was sleeping) we probably talked for \~20 min about movies and a bit about our personal lives as it related to these movies. At one point when she realized we have the same general taste in film (and the same favorites), she exclaimed ""we have to be friends!"" At a certain point I think she realized she should go back and let me sleep (though I was enjoying the conversation) and she mentioned she'd write me a list of recommendations.

By the time I woke up the flight was almost ending. She handed me a note with those recommendations and her letterboxd handle. Since I was in her home country for a couple of weeks, I wrote her a note saying I enjoyed the conversation and would love to get coffee and talk movies if she's free in the next few weeks and wrote down my number. It probably sounded like more of a come on than I intended as I just thought we connected well. I handed it to her before I left the plane. She never reached out, which is fine, but she also never followed back on letterboxd which makes me wonder if I gave her the ick or something. I realized I don't know what the etiquette is on this sorta thing and would love to get some perspective on how a FA would take this kind of note.",2,1770398416.0,flightattendants,4,0.75,False

1qxnlsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qxnlsb/my_fathers_rotary_phone_rings_every_night_at_300/,"My father’s rotary phone rings every night at 3:00 AM. I finally followed the cord, and I wish I hadn't.","the only way I can describe it. It’s not just the television, which sits in the corner of the living room like a grey, unblinking eye, hissing that white noise at a volume just low enough to be a vibration in your teeth rather than a sound in your ears. It’s the house itself. The air here hangs suspended, thick with the smell of menthol rub, dust that has settled since the nineties, and the distinct, sweet-rot scent of old paper decomposing in damp corners.

Moving back in wasn't a choice so much as a lack of options. My career had imploded in the city, a slow-motion car crash of layoffs and bad luck, and my father’s health had taken a nosedive that the neighbors couldn't ignore anymore. They called me after he was found wandering the lawn in his underwear, screaming at a squirrel that he claimed was transmitting government secrets. Dementia, the doctors said, mixed with a general shutting down of the systems. He was physically frail, a husk of the man who used to terrify me with his booming voice, but his mind was the real casualty. It had retreated into a fortress of confusion and silence, leaving only a shell that stared at the snowy screen of a television set that hadn't been connected to a cable box in a decade.

The house was a time capsule, but the kind you regret opening. Every surface was covered. Stacks of Reader’s Digest from 1988, towers of yellowing newspapers, ceramic figurines of shepherdesses with chipped noses, and boxes of unidentified rusted hardware. The clutter created narrow canyons through the living room and hallway, pathways you had to navigate sideways.

And then there was the phone.

He refused to have a cell phone in the house. He claimed the signals scrambled his thoughts, made the ""buzzing"" inside his head louder. I tried to argue with him during the first week, pulling my smartphone out of my pocket to show him it was harmless, but he went into such a violent fit of trembling and weeping that I eventually just turned it off and threw it in my suitcase. To communicate with the outside world—to order his prescriptions, to call the pharmacy, to maybe, eventually, find a job—we relied on the landline.

It was a rotary. A heavy, black Bakelite beast that sat on a dedicated table in the hallway, the centerpiece of a shrine made of phonebooks and message pads that hadn't been written on in years. It was connected to the wall by a curly, frayed cord that looked like a dried earthworm.

The first month was just the routine. I’d wake up, change his sheets, sponge-bathe him while he stared past me at some invisible horizon, and then park him in his armchair in front of the static. I’d spoon-feed him oatmeal that he barely swallowed. The isolation was absolute. The suburbs out here aren't the friendly kind where neighbors wave; they are vast, silent grids of dying lawns and closed blinds.

The calls started in the middle of the second month.

I am a light sleeper. The silence of the house usually kept me on edge, the settling of the foundation sounding like footsteps. But when the phone rang that first time, it shattered the night like a hammer through glass.

It was a physical sound, that mechanical bell. 

Brrr-ing.

 Brrr-ing.

I jolted up, heart hammering against my ribs, squinting at the glowing red numbers on my digital clock. 3:00 AM. Exactly.

I stumbled out of the spare room, navigating the hallway clutter by memory and the pale moonlight filtering through the grimy windows. The phone kept ringing, an insistent, angry sound. My father’s door was closed. He didn't stir. He slept like the dead, aided by a heavy dose of sedatives.

I picked up the receiver, the plastic cold and greasy against my ear.

""Hello?""

 My voice was a croak, thick with sleep.

Static. A crackling, popping interference, like a radio tuned between stations during a thunderstorm.

""Hello? Is anyone there?""

 I asked again, annoyance beginning to override the adrenaline.

""It’s dark,"" 

a voice whispered.

I froze. It was a child. A boy, maybe seven or eight years old. The voice was trembling so hard the words were barely coherent, wet with tears and snot.

""Who is this?""

 I gripped the phone tighter. 

""Where are your parents?""

""The Rabbit Man,"" 

the boy whimpered. The audio quality was terrible, fading in and out as if he were calling from the bottom of a well.

 ""He says I have to wait in the dark room. He says I was bad.""

A cold prickle danced down the back of my neck.

 ""Listen to me,""

 I said, trying to keep my voice steady. 

""You need to hang up and call 911. Do you know how to do that?""

""My head hurts,""

 the boy sobbed, his voice pitching up into a jagged whine. 

""The Rabbit Man hit the wall. He dragged me. I want to go home. Please.""

""Where are you? Tell me where you are.""

""I don't know,"" 

he gasped. 

""It smells like... like oil. And dirt. I can’t see my hands.""

""Stay on the line,""

 I said, looking around the dark hallway as if help might materialize from the shadows.

 ""I’m going to call for help on another line, okay? Just stay—""

The line clicked. Then, the hum of the dial tone.

I stood there for a long time, the receiver still pressed to my ear, listening to the drone of the disconnected line. I eventually hung up and dialed \*69, hoping to trace the last call.

“The service you are attempting to use is not available from this line,” a robotic female voice informed me.

Of course. The landline package was probably the bare minimum, untouched since the eighties. I sat on the floor beside the phone table, hugging my knees. It had to be a prank. Kids these days, with their apps and their boredom. They probably found a list of active landlines and were seeing who they could scare. It was a script. ""The Rabbit Man."" It sounded like something from an internet creepypasta.

But the fear in that voice... it stuck with me. It was the wet, gasping quality of the breathing. The sheer exhaustion in the terror.

The next day, the house felt heavier. The dust seemed to hang lower in the air. My father was particularly difficult, refusing to open his mouth for his medication. He kept turning his head toward the hallway, his milky eyes widening, but when I asked him what he wanted, he just mumbled nonsense words. ""Soft,"" he said once. ""Soft ears.""

I ignored it. He said a lot of things.

That night, I didn't sleep. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, waiting.

3:00 AM.

Brrr-ing.

I was at the phone before the second ring finished.

""Hello?""

""I’m thirsty."" 

The same voice. Weaker this time. 

""It’s so hot in here.""

""Who are you calling?""

 I demanded, skipping the pleasantries. 

""Is this a game?""

""I missed the fireworks,"" 

the boy whispered, ignoring me completely. He sounded delirious.

 ""Mom said we could watch the fireworks after the rides. At the Millennium Fair. I wanted to see the big wheel.""

My stomach dropped.

""The Millennium Fair?""

 I asked, my voice was a whisper.

""The Rabbit Man gave me a balloon,""

 the boy continued, his words slurring. 

""He said... he said he had a surprise. Under the stage. But we went down. We went down so far.""

""Kid, listen to me. The Millennium Fair... that isn't happening now.""

""I want my mom,""

 he cried, a sudden, piercing shriek that made me pull the phone away from my ear. 

""It’s too tight! The walls are too tight!""

Click. Hum.

I stood in the hallway, shivering despite the summer heat trapped in the house. The Millennium Fair. I remembered it. Everyone in the county remembered it. It was a massive traveling carnival that had come through the state capital to celebrate the turn of the century. New Year's Eve, 1999.

I was in high school then. I remembered the lights, the sheer scale of it. But that was 26 years ago.

If this was a prank, it was incredibly specific and incredibly cruel. Why reference a fair that happened a 26 years ago? Was the kid reading a script? Or was it a recording?

I went to the kitchen and made coffee, my hands shaking as I poured the water. I spent the hours until dawn sitting at the kitchen table, staring at the phone in the hallway. I tried to rationalize it. A recording made more sense. Someone playing an old tape over the line? But the boy had responded to the flow of conversation, even if he didn't answer my questions directly.

When the sun came up, I drove to the library in the next town over—the only place with decent Wi-Fi. I needed to verify my memory.

I searched ""Millennium Fair kidnapping.""

The results were sparse. It had been a chaotic event. Too many people, too much alcohol, Y2K panic mixed with celebration. There were reports of fights, a few drug arrests, lost children who were found within hours.

But there was one cold case.

Michael Miller, age 7. Last seen near the exit of the fairgrounds, wearing a blue windbreaker and holding a red balloon. Witnesses reported seeing him walking with a costumed character, though no mascots were scheduled for that area of the park.

I stared at the grainy photo of the boy on the screen. He had a gap-toothed smile and messy hair.

Seven years old.

The boy on the phone sounded seven.

I went back to the house with a knot of dread in my gut so tight it made it hard to breathe. The house smelled worse today—a sharp, acrid tang of ammonia cutting through the dust. My father was sitting exactly where I’d left him, bathed in the static glow.

""Dad?""

 I asked, walking into the living room.

He didn't blink.

""Dad, did you ever hear about a boy going missing? Years ago? At a fair?""

Slowly, agonizingly, his head turned. His neck crunched, a dry, brittle sound. He looked at me, and for a second, the fog in his eyes seemed to clear, replaced by a sharp, predatory lucidness that I hadn't seen in years.

""Everyone goes missing eventually,"" 

he rasped. Then he turned back to the TV and let out a long, wheezing laugh that turned into a cough.

I decided then that I wouldn't answer the phone again. It was doing something to me. It was making the shadows in the corners of the room look like crouching figures. It was making the silence of the house sound like held breath. If it was a prank, I was feeding it. If it was... something else... I didn't want to let it in.

For the next three nights, the phone rang at 3:00 AM.

Brrr-ing.

Brrr-ing.

I lay in bed, pillow wrapped around my head, counting the rings. It always rang exactly ten times. Then silence.

But the silence was worse. Because in the silence, I started hearing other things. Sounds coming from inside the house.

A soft scraping sound. Like fabric dragging over wood.

It seemed to come from the ceiling.

By the fourth day of ignoring the calls, the atmosphere in the house had become unbearable. The air felt pressurized. My father was agitated, rocking back and forth in his chair, muttering about ""leaks"" and ""patches.""

I needed to do something productive. I needed to exert some control over this rotting environment. I decided to tackle the attic.

The attic hatch was in the hallway, right above the phone table. I hadn't been up there since I was a child. It was a forbidden zone, the place where my father stored his ""projects."" He was a handyman by trade, a tinkerer. He fixed things—toasters, radios, lawnmowers.

I pulled the cord, and the folding ladder creaked down, releasing a shower of dust and dead flies. I climbed up, coughing, clicking on the single bare bulb that hung from the rafters.

The attic was stiflingly hot, smelling of baked pine and fiberglass insulation. It was crammed with boxes, just like the rest of the house, but these were older. Wooden crates, metal footlockers.

I started moving things around, looking for space, looking for anything that could be thrown away. I found boxes of old tubes for radios, jars of rusted nails, a collection of license plates from the seventies.

And then I found the trunk.

It was pushed all the way into the eaves, hidden behind a stack of water-damaged insulation rolls. It was an old steamer trunk, heavy and bound in leather that had cracked like a dry riverbed.

I shouldn't have opened it. I knew that the moment my hand touched the latch. The metal was cold, unnaturally so for how hot the attic was.

I popped the latches. They groaned in protest. I threw the lid back.

The smell hit me first. It was the smell of the garage—motor oil, grease, gasoline—mixed with something biological. Sweat. Dried saliva. Unwashed hair.

Lying inside the trunk, folded haphazardly, was a suit.

It was made of a coarse, grey synthetic fur that had matted and clumped with age and grime. There were dark stains on the chest and stomach, stiff and crusty.

I reached out, my fingers trembling, and pulled it up.

It was a rabbit suit. But not a cute Easter bunny. This was something homemade, something stitched together with fishing line and desperation. The headpiece was heavy, made of papier-mâché covered in that same matted fur. The ears were long and asymmetrical, one bent sharply in the middle as if broken. The eyes were empty sockets, rimmed with red felt. The mouth was a fixed, jagged grin cut into the mask, revealing a mesh screen behind it that was clogged with... something dark.

I dropped it. I dropped it like it was burning.

""The Rabbit Man.""

The boy’s voice echoed in my head. 

I backed away, scrambling over the boxes, my heart hammering a frantic rhythm against my ribs. I couldn't breathe. The air in the attic was suddenly sucked out, replaced by the vacuum of realization.

My father.

My father, the handyman. The man who could fix anything. 

I scrambled down the ladder, nearly falling the last few feet. I hit the hallway floor and looked at the phone. It sat there, silent, accusing.

I ran into the living room. My father was there, bathed in the static.

""Dad,""

 I said, my voice shaking so hard it distorted the word.

He didn't move.

""Dad, what is in the attic?"" 

I shouted. 

""What is that suit?""

He stopped rocking. The static hissed. Shhhhhhh.

He slowly turned his chair. He didn't use his feet; he just shifted his weight, the old wood of the chair groaning. He faced me. His eyes were clear again. Lucid. Horribly, terrifyingly lucid.

He looked at me with a mixture of pity and annoyance, like I was a child interrupting an important meeting.

""I had to hide this part of me,"" 

he said. His voice was strong, devoid of the tremulous wheeze of the last few months.

 ""He was broken.""

I stared at him, my blood running cold.

 ""Who? Who was broken?""

""The boy,"" 

my father said. 

""He wouldn't stop crying. I tried to fix him. I tried to make him quiet. But he was broken inside.""

He smiled. It wasn't a fatherly smile. It was a baring of teeth, yellow and long.

""So I put him where the noise wouldn't bother me. ""

I stumbled back, bile rising in my throat.

 ""You... you killed him?""

""I fixed the problem,""

 he said, turning back to the TV. 

""Now, be quiet. The show is starting.""

He dissolved back into the slump, the clarity vanishing as quickly as it had come.

I ran to the kitchen. I needed to call the police. I grabbed my cell phone from my bag—dead battery. Of course. I hadn't charged it in weeks.

I looked at the hallway. The rotary phone.

I couldn't touch it. I couldn't go near it. But I had to. I had to call 911.

I approached the phone like it was a bomb. I lifted the receiver.

Silence. No dial tone.

I tapped the hook. Nothing. Dead air.

I checked the wall jack. The plastic clip was snapped in, tight.

""Come on,""

 I whispered, panic rising.

 ""Come on.""

I followed the cord. It wound from the back of the phone, coiled across the table, and dropped behind it.

I pulled the table away from the wall.

The cord didn't go into the wall jack.

The jack on the wall was empty. Painted over. This was new, when did this happened ?

The cord from the phone went down. It went through a crudely drilled hole in the floorboards, right next to the baseboard.

My mind couldn't process it. I had been getting calls. I had heard the ringing. I had spoken to the boy.

I fell to my knees. I grabbed the cord and pulled. It was taut. Anchored to something below.

I needed to see. I didn't want to, but the compulsion was a physical force, a hook in my navel pulling me forward.

I ran to the garage and grabbed a pry bar. I came back, the sound of my breathing loud and ragged in the silent house. My father was humming in the living room, a low, discordant tune.

I jammed the pry bar into the gap between the floorboards where the wire disappeared. The wood was old, but the nails screamed as they gave way.

Craaaack.

I levered up one board. Then another. The smell rushed up at me.

There was a space between the floor joists. But it wasn't just a crawlspace. It had been modified. Lined.

Egg cartons. layers and layers of them, glued to the joists and the subfloor. And acoustic foam. And old carpet scraps.

It was a soundproof box. A coffin buried in the architecture of the house.

I shone the flashlight from the hallway down into the hole.

The space was small. cramped. Maybe three feet deep and four feet long.

In the center of the nest, lying on a bed of filthy rags, was a skeleton.

It was small. The bones were yellowed, delicate. It was wearing the tattered remains of a blue windbreaker.

And in its skeletal hand, gripped tight, was the other end of the phone cord.

It wasn't plugged into anything. The wires were stripped, wrapped around the finger bones of the skeleton's hand, rusted and fused to the calcium.

The receiver of a toy phone—a Fisher-Price plastic thing, red and blue—lay near the skull. But the cord... the cord connected the real phone in the hallway to the boy’s hand.

I stared at it. The physics of it. The impossibility of it.

And then, the phone in the hallway, the phone that was currently disconnected from the wall, the phone whose wire ended in the grip of a 26  years old corpse...

It rang.

Brrr-ing.

The sound vibrated through the floorboards, through my knees, into my teeth.

Brrr-ing.

I looked down into the hole. The jaw of the skull was open, fixed in an eternal scream.

Brrr-ing.

I didn't answer it. I couldn't.

I backed away, scrambling on my hands and feet, crab-walking away from the hole, away from the hallway.

I scrambled into the living room. My father was standing now. He wasn't looking at the TV. He was looking at the hallway.

He looked at me, and his face was full of a terrible, childlike confusion.

""Do you hear that?"" 

he whispered.

The ringing didn't stop. It got louder.

""He's loud today,"" 

my father said, covering his ears. 

""He's so loud. I thought I fixed it. I thought I made the room quiet.""

The ringing wasn't coming from the phone anymore.

It was coming from under the floor. It was coming from the walls. It was coming from the attic.

""I tried to tell you,""

 The kids voice suddenly whispered. but from the static on the TV.

I spun around. The screen was no longer just snow. Shapes were forming in the black and white chaos. A figure. Tall. Wearing long ears.

""I tried to tell you,"" 

the TV hissed, the volume rising, screaming the words. ""IT'S DARK.""

My father started to scream. A high, thin wail that matched the pitch of the static.

I ran. I didn't grab my keys. I didn't grab my bag. I smashed through the front door, stumbling out into the humid night air of the suburbs. I ran until my lungs burned, until I was three streets away, standing under the buzzing sodium light of a streetlamp.

I looked back toward the house. It sat there, dark and silent against the night sky.

But even from here, three blocks away, I could feel it. A vibration in the ground. A rhythmic, mechanical pulse.

Brrr-ing.

Brrr-ing.

I’m in a motel now. I walked until I found a gas station and called a cab. I haven't called the police yet. I don't know what to say. ""My father is a killer""? ""The phone line is connected to a ghost""?

I’m sitting on the edge of the motel bed. There’s a phone on the nightstand. A modern one. A generic beige block with buttons.

I unplugged it as soon as I walked in. I pulled the cord right out of the wall.

But I’m staring at it.

Because five minutes ago, the red message light started blinking.

And I can hear it. Faintly. Coming from the earpiece sitting in its cradle.

Static.

And a whisper.

I finally followed the cord, and I wish I hadn't.","the only way I can describe it. It’s not just the television, which sits in the corner of the living room like a grey, unblinking eye, hissing that white noise at a volume just low enough to be a vibration in your teeth rather than a sound in your ears. It’s the house itself. The air here hangs suspended, thick with the smell of menthol rub, dust that has settled since the nineties, and the distinct, sweet-rot scent of old paper decomposing in damp corners.

Moving back in wasn't a choice so much as a lack of options. My career had imploded in the city, a slow-motion car crash of layoffs and bad luck, and my father’s health had taken a nosedive that the neighbors couldn't ignore anymore. They called me after he was found wandering the lawn in his underwear, screaming at a squirrel that he claimed was transmitting government secrets. Dementia, the doctors said, mixed with a general shutting down of the systems. He was physically frail, a husk of the man who used to terrify me with his booming voice, but his mind was the real casualty. It had retreated into a fortress of confusion and silence, leaving only a shell that stared at the snowy screen of a television set that hadn't been connected to a cable box in a decade.

The house was a time capsule, but the kind you regret opening. Every surface was covered. Stacks of Reader’s Digest from 1988, towers of yellowing newspapers, ceramic figurines of shepherdesses with chipped noses, and boxes of unidentified rusted hardware. The clutter created narrow canyons through the living room and hallway, pathways you had to navigate sideways.

And then there was the phone.

He refused to have a cell phone in the house. He claimed the signals scrambled his thoughts, made the ""buzzing"" inside his head louder. I tried to argue with him during the first week, pulling my smartphone out of my pocket to show him it was harmless, but he went into such a violent fit of trembling and weeping that I eventually just turned it off and threw it in my suitcase. To communicate with the outside world—to order his prescriptions, to call the pharmacy, to maybe, eventually, find a job—we relied on the landline.

It was a rotary. A heavy, black Bakelite beast that sat on a dedicated table in the hallway, the centerpiece of a shrine made of phonebooks and message pads that hadn't been written on in years. It was connected to the wall by a curly, frayed cord that looked like a dried earthworm.

The first month was just the routine. I’d wake up, change his sheets, sponge-bathe him while he stared past me at some invisible horizon, and then park him in his armchair in front of the static. I’d spoon-feed him oatmeal that he barely swallowed. The isolation was absolute. The suburbs out here aren't the friendly kind where neighbors wave; they are vast, silent grids of dying lawns and closed blinds.

The calls started in the middle of the second month.

I am a light sleeper. The silence of the house usually kept me on edge, the settling of the foundation sounding like footsteps. But when the phone rang that first time, it shattered the night like a hammer through glass.

It was a physical sound, that mechanical bell. 

Brrr-ing.

 Brrr-ing.

I jolted up, heart hammering against my ribs, squinting at the glowing red numbers on my digital clock. 3:00 AM. Exactly.

I stumbled out of the spare room, navigating the hallway clutter by memory and the pale moonlight filtering through the grimy windows. The phone kept ringing, an insistent, angry sound. My father’s door was closed. He didn't stir. He slept like the dead, aided by a heavy dose of sedatives.

I picked up the receiver, the plastic cold and greasy against my ear.

""Hello?""

 My voice was a croak, thick with sleep.

Static. A crackling, popping interference, like a radio tuned between stations during a thunderstorm.

""Hello? Is anyone there?""

 I asked again, annoyance beginning to override the adrenaline.

""It’s dark,"" 

a voice whispered.

I froze. It was a child. A boy, maybe seven or eight years old. The voice was trembling so hard the words were barely coherent, wet with tears and snot.

""Who is this?""

 I gripped the phone tighter. 

""Where are your parents?""

""The Rabbit Man,"" 

the boy whimpered. The audio quality was terrible, fading in and out as if he were calling from the bottom of a well.

 ""He says I have to wait in the dark room. He says I was bad.""

A cold prickle danced down the back of my neck.

 ""Listen to me,""

 I said, trying to keep my voice steady. 

""You need to hang up and call 911. Do you know how to do that?""

""My head hurts,""

 the boy sobbed, his voice pitching up into a jagged whine. 

""The Rabbit Man hit the wall. He dragged me. I want to go home. Please.""

""Where are you? Tell me where you are.""

""I don't know,"" 

he gasped. 

""It smells like... like oil. And dirt. I can’t see my hands.""

""Stay on the line,""

 I said, looking around the dark hallway as if help might materialize from the shadows.

 ""I’m going to call for help on another line, okay? Just stay—""

The line clicked. Then, the hum of the dial tone.

I stood there for a long time, the receiver still pressed to my ear, listening to the drone of the disconnected line. I eventually hung up and dialed \*69, hoping to trace the last call.

“The service you are attempting to use is not available from this line,” a robotic female voice informed me.

Of course. The landline package was probably the bare minimum, untouched since the eighties. I sat on the floor beside the phone table, hugging my knees. It had to be a prank. Kids these days, with their apps and their boredom. They probably found a list of active landlines and were seeing who they could scare. It was a script. ""The Rabbit Man."" It sounded like something from an internet creepypasta.

But the fear in that voice... it stuck with me. It was the wet, gasping quality of the breathing. The sheer exhaustion in the terror.

The next day, the house felt heavier. The dust seemed to hang lower in the air. My father was particularly difficult, refusing to open his mouth for his medication. He kept turning his head toward the hallway, his milky eyes widening, but when I asked him what he wanted, he just mumbled nonsense words. ""Soft,"" he said once. ""Soft ears.""

I ignored it. He said a lot of things.

That night, I didn't sleep. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, waiting.

3:00 AM.

Brrr-ing.

I was at the phone before the second ring finished.

""Hello?""

""I’m thirsty."" 

The same voice. Weaker this time. 

""It’s so hot in here.""

""Who are you calling?""

 I demanded, skipping the pleasantries. 

""Is this a game?""

""I missed the fireworks,"" 

the boy whispered, ignoring me completely. He sounded delirious.

 ""Mom said we could watch the fireworks after the rides. At the Millennium Fair. I wanted to see the big wheel.""

My stomach dropped.

""The Millennium Fair?""

 I asked, my voice was a whisper.

""The Rabbit Man gave me a balloon,""

 the boy continued, his words slurring. 

""He said... he said he had a surprise. Under the stage. But we went down. We went down so far.""

""Kid, listen to me. The Millennium Fair... that isn't happening now.""

""I want my mom,""

 he cried, a sudden, piercing shriek that made me pull the phone away from my ear. 

""It’s too tight! The walls are too tight!""

Click. Hum.

I stood in the hallway, shivering despite the summer heat trapped in the house. The Millennium Fair. I remembered it. Everyone in the county remembered it. It was a massive traveling carnival that had come through the state capital to celebrate the turn of the century. New Year's Eve, 1999.

I was in high school then. I remembered the lights, the sheer scale of it. But that was 26 years ago.

If this was a prank, it was incredibly specific and incredibly cruel. Why reference a fair that happened a 26 years ago? Was the kid reading a script? Or was it a recording?

I went to the kitchen and made coffee, my hands shaking as I poured the water. I spent the hours until dawn sitting at the kitchen table, staring at the phone in the hallway. I tried to rationalize it. A recording made more sense. Someone playing an old tape over the line? But the boy had responded to the flow of conversation, even if he didn't answer my questions directly.

When the sun came up, I drove to the library in the next town over—the only place with decent Wi-Fi. I needed to verify my memory.

I searched ""Millennium Fair kidnapping.""

The results were sparse. It had been a chaotic event. Too many people, too much alcohol, Y2K panic mixed with celebration. There were reports of fights, a few drug arrests, lost children who were found within hours.

But there was one cold case.

Michael Miller, age 7. Last seen near the exit of the fairgrounds, wearing a blue windbreaker and holding a red balloon. Witnesses reported seeing him walking with a costumed character, though no mascots were scheduled for that area of the park.

I stared at the grainy photo of the boy on the screen. He had a gap-toothed smile and messy hair.

Seven years old.

The boy on the phone sounded seven.

I went back to the house with a knot of dread in my gut so tight it made it hard to breathe. The house smelled worse today—a sharp, acrid tang of ammonia cutting through the dust. My father was sitting exactly where I’d left him, bathed in the static glow.

""Dad?""

 I asked, walking into the living room.

He didn't blink.

""Dad, did you ever hear about a boy going missing? Years ago? At a fair?""

Slowly, agonizingly, his head turned. His neck crunched, a dry, brittle sound. He looked at me, and for a second, the fog in his eyes seemed to clear, replaced by a sharp, predatory lucidness that I hadn't seen in years.

""Everyone goes missing eventually,"" 

he rasped. Then he turned back to the TV and let out a long, wheezing laugh that turned into a cough.

I decided then that I wouldn't answer the phone again. It was doing something to me. It was making the shadows in the corners of the room look like crouching figures. It was making the silence of the house sound like held breath. If it was a prank, I was feeding it. If it was... something else... I didn't want to let it in.

For the next three nights, the phone rang at 3:00 AM.

Brrr-ing.

Brrr-ing.

I lay in bed, pillow wrapped around my head, counting the rings. It always rang exactly ten times. Then silence.

But the silence was worse. Because in the silence, I started hearing other things. Sounds coming from inside the house.

A soft scraping sound. Like fabric dragging over wood.

It seemed to come from the ceiling.

By the fourth day of ignoring the calls, the atmosphere in the house had become unbearable. The air felt pressurized. My father was agitated, rocking back and forth in his chair, muttering about ""leaks"" and ""patches.""

I needed to do something productive. I needed to exert some control over this rotting environment. I decided to tackle the attic.

The attic hatch was in the hallway, right above the phone table. I hadn't been up there since I was a child. It was a forbidden zone, the place where my father stored his ""projects."" He was a handyman by trade, a tinkerer. He fixed things—toasters, radios, lawnmowers.

I pulled the cord, and the folding ladder creaked down, releasing a shower of dust and dead flies. I climbed up, coughing, clicking on the single bare bulb that hung from the rafters.

The attic was stiflingly hot, smelling of baked pine and fiberglass insulation. It was crammed with boxes, just like the rest of the house, but these were older. Wooden crates, metal footlockers.

I started moving things around, looking for space, looking for anything that could be thrown away. I found boxes of old tubes for radios, jars of rusted nails, a collection of license plates from the seventies.

And then I found the trunk.

It was pushed all the way into the eaves, hidden behind a stack of water-damaged insulation rolls. It was an old steamer trunk, heavy and bound in leather that had cracked like a dry riverbed.

I shouldn't have opened it. I knew that the moment my hand touched the latch. The metal was cold, unnaturally so for how hot the attic was.

I popped the latches. They groaned in protest. I threw the lid back.

The smell hit me first. It was the smell of the garage—motor oil, grease, gasoline—mixed with something biological. Sweat. Dried saliva. Unwashed hair.

Lying inside the trunk, folded haphazardly, was a suit.

It was made of a coarse, grey synthetic fur that had matted and clumped with age and grime. There were dark stains on the chest and stomach, stiff and crusty.

I reached out, my fingers trembling, and pulled it up.

It was a rabbit suit. But not a cute Easter bunny. This was something homemade, something stitched together with fishing line and desperation. The headpiece was heavy, made of papier-mâché covered in that same matted fur. The ears were long and asymmetrical, one bent sharply in the middle as if broken. The eyes were empty sockets, rimmed with red felt. The mouth was a fixed, jagged grin cut into the mask, revealing a mesh screen behind it that was clogged with... something dark.

I dropped it. I dropped it like it was burning.

""The Rabbit Man.""

The boy’s voice echoed in my head. 

I backed away, scrambling over the boxes, my heart hammering a frantic rhythm against my ribs. I couldn't breathe. The air in the attic was suddenly sucked out, replaced by the vacuum of realization.

My father.

My father, the handyman. The man who could fix anything. 

I scrambled down the ladder, nearly falling the last few feet. I hit the hallway floor and looked at the phone. It sat there, silent, accusing.

I ran into the living room. My father was there, bathed in the static.

""Dad,""

 I said, my voice shaking so hard it distorted the word.

He didn't move.

""Dad, what is in the attic?"" 

I shouted. 

""What is that suit?""

He stopped rocking. The static hissed. Shhhhhhh.

He slowly turned his chair. He didn't use his feet; he just shifted his weight, the old wood of the chair groaning. He faced me. His eyes were clear again. Lucid. Horribly, terrifyingly lucid.

He looked at me with a mixture of pity and annoyance, like I was a child interrupting an important meeting.

""I had to hide this part of me,"" 

he said. His voice was strong, devoid of the tremulous wheeze of the last few months.

 ""He was broken.""

I stared at him, my blood running cold.

 ""Who? Who was broken?""

""The boy,"" 

my father said. 

""He wouldn't stop crying. I tried to fix him. I tried to make him quiet. But he was broken inside.""

He smiled. It wasn't a fatherly smile. It was a baring of teeth, yellow and long.

""So I put him where the noise wouldn't bother me. ""

I stumbled back, bile rising in my throat.

 ""You... you killed him?""

""I fixed the problem,""

 he said, turning back to the TV. 

""Now, be quiet. The show is starting.""

He dissolved back into the slump, the clarity vanishing as quickly as it had come.

I ran to the kitchen. I needed to call the police. I grabbed my cell phone from my bag—dead battery. Of course. I hadn't charged it in weeks.

I looked at the hallway. The rotary phone.

I couldn't touch it. I couldn't go near it. But I had to. I had to call 911.

I approached the phone like it was a bomb. I lifted the receiver.

Silence. No dial tone.

I tapped the hook. Nothing. Dead air.

I checked the wall jack. The plastic clip was snapped in, tight.

""Come on,""

 I whispered, panic rising.

 ""Come on.""

I followed the cord. It wound from the back of the phone, coiled across the table, and dropped behind it.

I pulled the table away from the wall.

The cord didn't go into the wall jack.

The jack on the wall was empty. Painted over. This was new, when did this happened ?

The cord from the phone went down. It went through a crudely drilled hole in the floorboards, right next to the baseboard.

My mind couldn't process it. I had been getting calls. I had heard the ringing. I had spoken to the boy.

I fell to my knees. I grabbed the cord and pulled. It was taut. Anchored to something below.

I needed to see. I didn't want to, but the compulsion was a physical force, a hook in my navel pulling me forward.

I ran to the garage and grabbed a pry bar. I came back, the sound of my breathing loud and ragged in the silent house. My father was humming in the living room, a low, discordant tune.

I jammed the pry bar into the gap between the floorboards where the wire disappeared. The wood was old, but the nails screamed as they gave way.

Craaaack.

I levered up one board. Then another. The smell rushed up at me.

There was a space between the floor joists. But it wasn't just a crawlspace. It had been modified. Lined.

Egg cartons. layers and layers of them, glued to the joists and the subfloor. And acoustic foam. And old carpet scraps.

It was a soundproof box. A coffin buried in the architecture of the house.

I shone the flashlight from the hallway down into the hole.

I spun around. The screen was no longer just snow. Shapes were forming in the black and white chaos. A figure. Tall. Wearing long ears.

""I tried to tell you,"" 

the TV hissed, the volume rising, screaming the words. ""IT'S DARK.""

My father started to scream. A high, thin wail that matched the pitch of the static.

I ran. I didn't grab my keys. I didn't grab my bag. I smashed through the front door, stumbling out into the humid night air of the suburbs. I ran until my lungs burned, until I was three streets away, standing under the buzzing sodium light of a streetlamp.

The next day, the house felt heavier. The dust seemed to hang lower in the air. My father was particularly difficult, refusing to open his mouth for his medication. He kept turning his head toward the hallway, his milky eyes widening, but when I asked him what he wanted, he just mumbled nonsense words. ""Soft,"" he said once. ""Soft ears.""

I ignored it. He said a lot of things.

That night, I didn't sleep. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, waiting.

3:00 AM.

Brrr-ing.

I was at the phone before the second ring finished.

""Hello?""

""I’m thirsty."" 

The same voice. Weaker this time. 

""It’s so hot in here.""

""Who are you calling?""

 I demanded, skipping the pleasantries. 

""Is this a game?""

""I missed the fireworks,"" 

the boy whispered, ignoring me completely. He sounded delirious.

 ""Mom said we could watch the fireworks after the rides. At the Millennium Fair. I wanted to see the big wheel.""

My stomach dropped.

""The Millennium Fair?""

 I asked, my voice was a whisper.

""The Rabbit Man gave me a balloon,""

 the boy continued, his words slurring. 

""He said... he said he had a surprise. Under the stage. But we went down. We went down so far.""

""Kid, listen to me. The Millennium Fair... that isn't happening now.""

""I want my mom,""

 he cried, a sudden, piercing shriek that made me pull the phone away from my ear. 

""It’s too tight! The walls are too tight!""

Click. Hum.

I stood in the hallway, shivering despite the summer heat trapped in the house. The Millennium Fair. I remembered it. Everyone in the county remembered it. It was a massive traveling carnival that had come through the state capital to celebrate the turn of the century. New Year's Eve, 1999.

I was in high school then. I remembered the lights, the sheer scale of it. But that was 26 years ago.

If this was a prank, it was incredibly specific and incredibly cruel. Why reference a fair that happened a 26 years ago? Was the kid reading a script? Or was it a recording?

I went to the kitchen and made coffee, my hands shaking as I poured the water. I spent the hours until dawn sitting at the kitchen table, staring at the phone in the hallway. I tried to rationalize it. A recording made more sense. Someone playing an old tape over the line? But the boy had responded to the flow of conversation, even if he didn't answer my questions directly.

When the sun came up, I drove to the library in the next town over—the only place with decent Wi-Fi. I needed to verify my memory.

I searched ""Millennium Fair kidnapping.""

The results were sparse. It had been a chaotic event. Too many people, too much alcohol, Y2K panic mixed with celebration. There were reports of fights, a few drug arrests, lost children who were found within hours.

But there was one cold case.

Michael Miller, age 7. Last seen near the exit of the fairgrounds, wearing a blue windbreaker and holding a red balloon. Witnesses reported seeing him walking with a costumed character, though no mascots were scheduled for that area of the park.

I stared at the grainy photo of the boy on the screen. He had a gap-toothed smile and messy hair.

Seven years old.

The boy on the phone sounded seven.

I went back to the house with a knot of dread in my gut so tight it made it hard to breathe. The house smelled worse today—a sharp, acrid tang of ammonia cutting through the dust. My father was sitting exactly where I’d left him, bathed in the static glow.

""Dad?""

 I asked, walking into the living room.

He didn't blink.

""Dad, did you ever hear about a boy going missing? Years ago? At a fair?""

Slowly, agonizingly, his head turned. His neck crunched, a dry, brittle sound. He looked at me, and for a second, the fog in his eyes seemed to clear, replaced by a sharp, predatory lucidness that I hadn't seen in years.

""Everyone goes missing eventually,"" 

he rasped. Then he turned back to the TV and let out a long, wheezing laugh that turned into a cough.

I decided then that I wouldn't answer the phone again. It was doing something to me. It was making the shadows in the corners of the room look like crouching figures. It was making the silence of the house sound like held breath. If it was a prank, I was feeding it. If it was... something else... I didn't want to let it in.

For the next three nights, the phone rang at 3:00 AM.

Brrr-ing.

Brrr-ing.

I lay in bed, pillow wrapped around my head, counting the rings. It always rang exactly ten times. Then silence.

But the silence was worse. Because in the silence, I started hearing other things. Sounds coming from inside the house.

A soft scraping sound. Like fabric dragging over wood.

It seemed to come from the ceiling.

By the fourth day of ignoring the calls, the atmosphere in the house had become unbearable. The air felt pressurized. My father was agitated, rocking back and forth in his chair, muttering about ""leaks"" and ""patches.""

I needed to do something productive. I needed to exert some control over this rotting environment. I decided to tackle the attic.

The attic hatch was in the hallway, right above the phone table. I hadn't been up there since I was a child. It was a forbidden zone, the place where my father stored his ""projects."" He was a handyman by trade, a tinkerer. He fixed things—toasters, radios, lawnmowers.

I pulled the cord, and the folding ladder creaked down, releasing a shower of dust and dead flies. I climbed up, coughing, clicking on the single bare bulb that hung from the rafters.

The attic was stiflingly hot, smelling of baked pine and fiberglass insulation. It was crammed with boxes, just like the rest of the house, but these were older. Wooden crates, metal footlockers.

I started moving things around, looking for space, looking for anything that could be thrown away. I found boxes of old tubes for radios, jars of rusted nails, a collection of license plates from the seventies.

And then I found the trunk.

It was pushed all the way into the eaves, hidden behind a stack of water-damaged insulation rolls. It was an old steamer trunk, heavy and bound in leather that had cracked like a dry riverbed.

I shouldn't have opened it. I knew that the moment my hand touched the latch. The metal was cold, unnaturally so for how hot the attic was.

I popped the latches. They groaned in protest. I threw the lid back.

The smell hit me first. It was the smell of the garage—motor oil, grease, gasoline—mixed with something biological. Sweat. Dried saliva. Unwashed hair.

Lying inside the trunk, folded haphazardly, was a suit.

It was made of a coarse, grey synthetic fur that had matted and clumped with age and grime. There were dark stains on the chest and stomach, stiff and crusty.

I reached out, my fingers trembling, and pulled it up.

It was a rabbit suit. But not a cute Easter bunny. This was something homemade, something stitched together with fishing line and desperation. The headpiece was heavy, made of papier-mâché covered in that same matted fur. The ears were long and asymmetrical, one bent sharply in the middle as if broken. The eyes were empty sockets, rimmed with red felt. The mouth was a fixed, jagged grin cut into the mask, revealing a mesh screen behind it that was clogged with... something dark.

I dropped it. I dropped it like it was burning.

""The Rabbit Man.""

The boy’s voice echoed in my head. 

I backed away, scrambling over the boxes, my heart hammering a frantic rhythm against my ribs. I couldn't breathe. The air in the attic was suddenly sucked out, replaced by the vacuum of realization.

My father.

My father, the handyman. The man who could fix anything. 

I scrambled down the ladder, nearly falling the last few feet. I hit the hallway floor and looked at the phone. It sat there, silent, accusing.

I ran into the living room. My father was there, bathed in the static.

""Dad,""

 I said, my voice shaking so hard it distorted the word.

He didn't move.

""Dad, what is in the attic?"" 

I shouted. 

""What is that suit?""

He stopped rocking. The static hissed. Shhhhhhh.

He slowly turned his chair. He didn't use his feet; he just shifted his weight, the old wood of the chair groaning. He faced me. His eyes were clear again. Lucid. Horribly, terrifyingly lucid.

He looked at me with a mixture of pity and annoyance, like I was a child interrupting an important meeting.

""I had to hide this part of me,"" 

he said. His voice was strong, devoid of the tremulous wheeze of the last few months.

 ""He was broken.""

I stared at him, my blood running cold.

 ""Who? Who was broken?""

""The boy,"" 

my father said. 

""He wouldn't stop crying. I tried to fix him. I tried to make him quiet. But he was broken inside.""

He smiled. It wasn't a fatherly smile. It was a baring of teeth, yellow and long.

""So I put him where the noise wouldn't bother me. ""

I stumbled back, bile rising in my throat.

 ""You... you killed him?""

""I fixed the problem,""

 he said, turning back to the TV. 

""Now, be quiet. The show is starting.""

He dissolved back into the slump, the clarity vanishing as quickly as it had come.

I ran to the kitchen. I needed to call the police. I grabbed my cell phone from my bag—dead battery. Of course. I hadn't charged it in weeks.

I looked at the hallway. The rotary phone.

I couldn't touch it. I couldn't go near it. But I had to. I had to call 911.

I approached the phone like it was a bomb. I lifted the receiver.

Silence. No dial tone.

I tapped the hook. Nothing. Dead air.

I checked the wall jack. The plastic clip was snapped in, tight.

""Come on,""

 I whispered, panic rising.

 ""Come on.""

I followed the cord. It wound from the back of the phone, coiled across the table, and dropped behind it.

I pulled the table away from the wall.

The cord didn't go into the wall jack.

The jack on the wall was empty. Painted over. This was new, when did this happened ?

The cord from the phone went down. It went through a crudely drilled hole in the floorboards, right next to the baseboard.

My mind couldn't process it. I had been getting calls. I had heard the ringing. I had spoken to the boy.

I fell to my knees. I grabbed the cord and pulled. It was taut. Anchored to something below.

I needed to see. I didn't want to, but the compulsion was a physical force, a hook in my navel pulling me forward.

I ran to the garage and grabbed a pry bar. I came back, the sound of my breathing loud and ragged in the silent house. My father was humming in the living room, a low, discordant tune.

I jammed the pry bar into the gap between the floorboards where the wire disappeared. The wood was old, but the nails screamed as they gave way.

Craaaack.

I levered up one board. Then another. The smell rushed up at me.

There was a space between the floor joists. But it wasn't just a crawlspace. It had been modified. Lined.

Egg cartons. layers and layers of them, glued to the joists and the subfloor. And acoustic foam. And old carpet scraps.

It was a soundproof box. A coffin buried in the architecture of the house.

I shone the flashlight from the hallway down into the hole.

The space was small. cramped. Maybe three feet deep and four feet long.

In the center of the nest, lying on a bed of filthy rags, was a skeleton.

It was small. The bones were yellowed, delicate. It was wearing the tattered remains of a blue windbreaker.

And in its skeletal hand, gripped tight, was the other end of the phone cord.

It wasn't plugged into anything. The wires were stripped, wrapped around the finger bones of the skeleton's hand, rusted and fused to the calcium.

The receiver of a toy phone—a Fisher-Price plastic thing, red and blue—lay near the skull. But the cord... the cord connected the real phone in the hallway to the boy’s hand.

I stared at it. The physics of it. The impossibility of it.

And then, the phone in the hallway, the phone that was currently disconnected from the wall, the phone whose wire ended in the grip of a 26  years old corpse...

It rang.

Brrr-ing.

The sound vibrated through the floorboards, through my knees, into my teeth.

Brrr-ing.

I looked down into the hole. The jaw of the skull was open, fixed in an eternal scream.

Brrr-ing.

I didn't answer it. I couldn't.

I backed away, scrambling on my hands and feet, crab-walking away from the hole, away from the hallway.

I scrambled into the living room. My father was standing now. He wasn't looking at the TV. He was looking at the hallway.

He looked at me, and his face was full of a terrible, childlike confusion.

""Do you hear that?"" 

he whispered.

The ringing didn't stop. It got louder.

""He's loud today,"" 

my father said, covering his ears. 

""He's so loud. I thought I fixed it. I thought I made the room quiet.""

The ringing wasn't coming from the phone anymore.

It was coming from under the floor. It was coming from the walls. It was coming from the attic.

""I tried to tell you,""

 The kids voice suddenly whispered. but from the static on the TV.

I spun around. The screen was no longer just snow. Shapes were forming in the black and white chaos. A figure. Tall. Wearing long ears.

""I tried to tell you,"" 

the TV hissed, the volume rising, screaming the words. ""IT'S DARK.""

My father started to scream. A high, thin wail that matched the pitch of the static.

I ran. I didn't grab my keys. I didn't grab my bag. I smashed through the front door, stumbling out into the humid night air of the suburbs. I ran until my lungs burned, until I was three streets away, standing under the buzzing sodium light of a streetlamp.

I looked back toward the house. It sat there, dark and silent against the night sky.

But even from here, three blocks away, I could feel it. A vibration in the ground. A rhythmic, mechanical pulse.

Brrr-ing.

Brrr-ing.

I’m in a motel now. I walked until I found a gas station and called a cab. I haven't called the police yet. I don't know what to say. ""My father is a killer""? ""The phone line is connected to a ghost""?

I’m sitting on the edge of the motel bed. There’s a phone on the nightstand. A modern one. A generic beige block with buttons.

I unplugged it as soon as I walked in. I pulled the cord right out of the wall.

But I’m staring at it.

Because five minutes ago, the red message light started blinking.

And I can hear it. Faintly. Coming from the earpiece sitting in its cradle.

Static.

And a whisper.

I finally followed the cord, and I wish I hadn't.","the only way I can describe it. It’s not just the television, which sits in the corner of the living room like a grey, unblinking eye, hissing that white noise at a volume just low enough to be a vibration in your teeth rather than a sound in your ears. It’s the house itself. The air here hangs suspended, thick with the smell of menthol rub, dust that has settled since the nineties, and the distinct, sweet-rot scent of old paper decomposing in damp corners.

Moving back in wasn't a choice so much as a lack of options. My career had imploded in the city, a slow-motion car crash of layoffs and bad luck, and my father’s health had taken a nosedive that the neighbors couldn't ignore anymore. They called me after he was found wandering the lawn in his underwear, screaming at a squirrel that he claimed was transmitting government secrets. Dementia, the doctors said, mixed with a general shutting down of the systems. He was physically frail, a husk of the man who used to terrify me with his booming voice, but his mind was the real casualty. It had retreated into a fortress of confusion and silence, leaving only a shell that stared at the snowy screen of a television set that hadn't been connected to a cable box in a decade.

The house was a time capsule, but the kind you regret opening. Every surface was covered. Stacks of Reader’s Digest from 1988, towers of yellowing newspapers, ceramic figurines of shepherdesses with chipped noses, and boxes of unidentified rusted hardware. The clutter created narrow canyons through the living room and hallway, pathways you had to navigate sideways.

And then there was the phone.

He refused to have a cell phone in the house. He claimed the signals scrambled his thoughts, made the ""buzzing"" inside his head louder. I tried to argue with him during the first week, pulling my smartphone out of my pocket to show him it was harmless, but he went into such a violent fit of trembling and weeping that I eventually just turned it off and threw it in my suitcase. To communicate with the outside world—to order his prescriptions, to call the pharmacy, to maybe, eventually, find a job—we relied on the landline.

It was a rotary. A heavy, black Bakelite beast that sat on a dedicated table in the hallway, the centerpiece of a shrine made of phonebooks and message pads that hadn't been written on in years. It was connected to the wall by a curly, frayed cord that looked like a dried earthworm.

The first month was just the routine. I’d wake up, change his sheets, sponge-bathe him while he stared past me at some invisible horizon, and then park him in his armchair in front of the static. I’d spoon-feed him oatmeal that he barely swallowed. The isolation was absolute. The suburbs out here aren't the friendly kind where neighbors wave; they are vast, silent grids of dying lawns and closed blinds.

The calls started in the middle of the second month.

I am a light sleeper. The silence of the house usually kept me on edge, the settling of the foundation sounding like footsteps. But when the phone rang that first time, it shattered the night like a hammer through glass.

It was a physical sound, that mechanical bell. 

Brrr-ing.

 Brrr-ing.

I jolted up, heart hammering against my ribs, squinting at the glowing red numbers on my digital clock. 3:00 AM. Exactly.

I stumbled out of the spare room, navigating the hallway clutter by memory and the pale moonlight filtering through the grimy windows. The phone kept ringing, an insistent, angry sound. My father’s door was closed. He didn't stir. He slept like the dead, aided by a heavy dose of sedatives.

I picked up the receiver, the plastic cold and greasy against my ear.

""Hello?""

 My voice was a croak, thick with sleep.

Static. A crackling, popping interference, like a radio tuned between stations during a thunderstorm.

""Hello? Is anyone there?""

 I asked again, annoyance beginning to override the adrenaline.

""It’s dark,"" 

a voice whispered.

I froze. It was a child. A boy, maybe seven or eight years old. The voice was trembling so hard the words were barely coherent, wet with tears and snot.

""Who is this?""

 I gripped the phone tighter. 

""Where are your parents?""

""The Rabbit Man,"" 

the boy whimpered. The audio quality was terrible, fading in and out as if he were calling from the bottom of a well.

 ""He says I have to wait in the dark room. He says I was bad.""

A cold prickle danced down the back of my neck.

 ""Listen to me,""

 I said, trying to keep my voice steady. 

""You need to hang up and call 911. Do you know how to do that?""

""My head hurts,""

 the boy sobbed, his voice pitching up into a jagged whine. 

""The Rabbit Man hit the wall. He dragged me. I want to go home. Please.""

""Where are you? Tell me where you are.""

""I don't know,"" 

he gasped. 

""It smells like... like oil. And dirt. I can’t see my hands.""

""Stay on the line,""

 I said, looking around the dark hallway as if help might materialize from the shadows.

 ""I’m going to call for help on another line, okay? Just stay—""

The line clicked. Then, the hum of the dial tone.

I stood there for a long time, the receiver still pressed to my ear, listening to the drone of the disconnected line. I eventually hung up and dialed \*69, hoping to trace the last call.

“The service you are attempting to use is not available from this line,” a robotic female voice informed me.

Of course. The landline package was probably the bare minimum, untouched since the eighties. I sat on the floor beside the phone table, hugging my knees. It had to be a prank. Kids these days, with their apps and their boredom. They probably found a list of active landlines and were seeing who they could scare. It was a script. ""The Rabbit Man."" It sounded like something from an internet creepypasta.

But the fear in that voice... it stuck with me. It was the wet, gasping quality of the breathing. The sheer exhaustion in the terror.

The next day, the house felt heavier. The dust seemed to hang lower in the air. My father was particularly difficult, refusing to open his mouth for his medication. He kept turning his head toward the hallway, his milky eyes widening, but when I asked him what he wanted, he just mumbled nonsense words. ""Soft,"" he said once. ""Soft ears.""

I ignored it. He said a lot of things.

I ran to the garage and grabbed a pry bar. I came back, the sound of my breathing loud and ragged in the silent house. My father was humming in the living room, a low, discordant tune.

I jammed the pry bar into the gap between the floorboards where the wire disappeared. The wood was old, but the nails screamed as they gave way.

Craaaack.

I levered up one board. Then another. The smell rushed up at me.

There was a space between the floor joists. But it wasn't just a crawlspace. It had been modified. Lined.

Egg cartons. layers and layers of them, glued to the joists and the subfloor. And acoustic foam. And old carpet scraps.

It was a soundproof box. A coffin buried in the architecture of the house.

I shone the flashlight from the hallway down into the hole.

The space was small. cramped. Maybe three feet deep and four feet long.

In the center of the nest, lying on a bed of filthy rags, was a skeleton.

It was small. The bones were yellowed, delicate. It was wearing the tattered remains of a blue windbreaker.

And in its skeletal hand, gripped tight, was the other end of the phone cord.

It wasn't plugged into anything. The wires were stripped, wrapped around the finger bones of the skeleton's hand, rusted and fused to the calcium.

The receiver of a toy phone—a Fisher-Price plastic thing, red and blue—lay near the skull. But the cord... the cord connected the real phone in the hallway to the boy’s hand.

I stared at it. The physics of it. The impossibility of it.

And then, the phone in the hallway, the phone that was currently disconnected from the wall, the phone whose wire ended in the grip of a 26  years old corpse...

It rang.

Brrr-ing.

The sound vibrated through the floorboards, through my knees, into my teeth.

Brrr-ing.

I looked down into the hole. The jaw of the skull was open, fixed in an eternal scream.

Brrr-ing.

I didn't answer it. I couldn't.

I backed away, scrambling on my hands and feet, crab-walking away from the hole, away from the hallway.

I scrambled into the living room. My father was standing now. He wasn't looking at the TV. He was looking at the hallway.

He looked at me, and his face was full of a terrible, childlike confusion.

""Do you hear that?"" 

he whispered.

The ringing didn't stop. It got louder.

""He's loud today,"" 

my father said, covering his ears. 

""He's so loud. I thought I fixed it. I thought I made the room quiet.""

The ringing wasn't coming from the phone anymore.

It was coming from under the floor. It was coming from the walls. It was coming from the attic.

""I tried to tell you,""

 The kids voice suddenly whispered. but from the static on the TV.

I spun around. The screen was no longer just snow. Shapes were forming in the black and white chaos. A figure. Tall. Wearing long ears.

""I tried to tell you,"" 

the TV hissed, the volume rising, screaming the words. ""IT'S DARK.""

My father started to scream. A high, thin wail that matched the pitch of the static.

I ran. I didn't grab my keys. I didn't grab my bag. I smashed through the front door, stumbling out into the humid night air of the suburbs. I ran until my lungs burned, until I was three streets away, standing under the buzzing sodium light of a streetlamp.

I looked back toward the house. It sat there, dark and silent against the night sky.

But even from here, three blocks away, I could feel it. A vibration in the ground. A rhythmic, mechanical pulse.

Brrr-ing.

Brrr-ing.

I’m in a motel now. I walked until I found a gas station and called a cab. I haven't called the police yet. I don't know what to say. ""My father is a killer""? ""The phone line is connected to a ghost""?

I’m sitting on the edge of the motel bed. There’s a phone on the nightstand. A modern one. A generic beige block with buttons.

I unplugged it as soon as I walked in. I pulled the cord right out of the wall.

But I’m staring at it.

Because five minutes ago, the red message light started blinking.

And I can hear it. Faintly. Coming from the earpiece sitting in its cradle.

Static.

And a whisper.

1qxnjoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qxnjoc/my_fathers_rotary_phone_rings_every_night_at_300/,"My father’s rotary phone rings every night at 3:00 AM. I finally followed the cord, and I wish I hadn't.","the only way I can describe it. It’s not just the television, which sits in the corner of the living room like a grey, unblinking eye, hissing that white noise at a volume just low enough to be a vibration in your teeth rather than a sound in your ears. It’s the house itself. The air here hangs suspended, thick with the smell of menthol rub, dust that has settled since the nineties, and the distinct, sweet-rot scent of old paper decomposing in damp corners.

Moving back in wasn't a choice so much as a lack of options. My career had imploded in the city, a slow-motion car crash of layoffs and bad luck, and my father’s health had taken a nosedive that the neighbors couldn't ignore anymore. They called me after he was found wandering the lawn in his underwear, screaming at a squirrel that he claimed was transmitting government secrets. Dementia, the doctors said, mixed with a general shutting down of the systems. He was physically frail, a husk of the man who used to terrify me with his booming voice, but his mind was the real casualty. It had retreated into a fortress of confusion and silence, leaving only a shell that stared at the snowy screen of a television set that hadn't been connected to a cable box in a decade.

The house was a time capsule, but the kind you regret opening. Every surface was covered. Stacks of Reader’s Digest from 1988, towers of yellowing newspapers, ceramic figurines of shepherdesses with chipped noses, and boxes of unidentified rusted hardware. The clutter created narrow canyons through the living room and hallway, pathways you had to navigate sideways.

And then there was the phone.

He refused to have a cell phone in the house. He claimed the signals scrambled his thoughts, made the ""buzzing"" inside his head louder. I tried to argue with him during the first week, pulling my smartphone out of my pocket to show him it was harmless, but he went into such a violent fit of trembling and weeping that I eventually just turned it off and threw it in my suitcase. To communicate with the outside world—to order his prescriptions, to call the pharmacy, to maybe, eventually, find a job—we relied on the landline.

It was a rotary. A heavy, black Bakelite beast that sat on a dedicated table in the hallway, the centerpiece of a shrine made of phonebooks and message pads that hadn't been written on in years. It was connected to the wall by a curly, frayed cord that looked like a dried earthworm.

The first month was just the routine. I’d wake up, change his sheets, sponge-bathe him while he stared past me at some invisible horizon, and then park him in his armchair in front of the static. I’d spoon-feed him oatmeal that he barely swallowed. The isolation was absolute. The suburbs out here aren't the friendly kind where neighbors wave; they are vast, silent grids of dying lawns and closed blinds.

The calls started in the middle of the second month.

I am a light sleeper. The silence of the house usually kept me on edge, the settling of the foundation sounding like footsteps. But when the phone rang that first time, it shattered the night like a hammer through glass.

It was a physical sound, that mechanical bell. 

Brrr-ing.

 Brrr-ing.

I jolted up, heart hammering against my ribs, squinting at the glowing red numbers on my digital clock. 3:00 AM. Exactly.

I stumbled out of the spare room, navigating the hallway clutter by memory and the pale moonlight filtering through the grimy windows. The phone kept ringing, an insistent, angry sound. My father’s door was closed. He didn't stir. He slept like the dead, aided by a heavy dose of sedatives.

I picked up the receiver, the plastic cold and greasy against my ear.

""Hello?""

 My voice was a croak, thick with sleep.

Static. A crackling, popping interference, like a radio tuned between stations during a thunderstorm.

""Hello? Is anyone there?""

 I asked again, annoyance beginning to override the adrenaline.

""It’s dark,"" 

a voice whispered.

I froze. It was a child. A boy, maybe seven or eight years old. The voice was trembling so hard the words were barely coherent, wet with tears and snot.

""Who is this?""

 I gripped the phone tighter. 

""Where are your parents?""

""The Rabbit Man,"" 

the boy whimpered. The audio quality was terrible, fading in and out as if he were calling from the bottom of a well.

 ""He says I have to wait in the dark room. He says I was bad.""

A cold prickle danced down the back of my neck.

 ""Listen to me,""

 I said, trying to keep my voice steady. 

""You need to hang up and call 911. Do you know how to do that?""

""My head hurts,""

 the boy sobbed, his voice pitching up into a jagged whine. 

""The Rabbit Man hit the wall. He dragged me. I want to go home. Please.""

""Where are you? Tell me where you are.""

""I don't know,"" 

he gasped. 

""It smells like... like oil. And dirt. I can’t see my hands.""

""Stay on the line,""

 I said, looking around the dark hallway as if help might materialize from the shadows.

 ""I’m going to call for help on another line, okay? Just stay—""

The line clicked. Then, the hum of the dial tone.

I stood there for a long time, the receiver still pressed to my ear, listening to the drone of the disconnected line. I eventually hung up and dialed \*69, hoping to trace the last call.

“The service you are attempting to use is not available from this line,” a robotic female voice informed me.

Of course. The landline package was probably the bare minimum, untouched since the eighties. I sat on the floor beside the phone table, hugging my knees. It had to be a prank. Kids these days, with their apps and their boredom. They probably found a list of active landlines and were seeing who they could scare. It was a script. ""The Rabbit Man."" It sounded like something from an internet creepypasta.

But the fear in that voice... it stuck with me. It was the wet, gasping quality of the breathing. The sheer exhaustion in the terror.

The next day, the house felt heavier. The dust seemed to hang lower in the air. My father was particularly difficult, refusing to open his mouth for his medication. He kept turning his head toward the hallway, his milky eyes widening, but when I asked him what he wanted, he just mumbled nonsense words. ""Soft,"" he said once. ""Soft ears.""

I ignored it. He said a lot of things.

That night, I didn't sleep. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, waiting.

3:00 AM.

Brrr-ing.

I was at the phone before the second ring finished.

""Hello?""

""I’m thirsty."" 

The same voice. Weaker this time. 

""It’s so hot in here.""

""Who are you calling?""

 I demanded, skipping the pleasantries. 

""Is this a game?""

""I missed the fireworks,"" 

the boy whispered, ignoring me completely. He sounded delirious.

 ""Mom said we could watch the fireworks after the rides. At the Millennium Fair. I wanted to see the big wheel.""

My stomach dropped.

""The Millennium Fair?""

 I asked, my voice was a whisper.

""The Rabbit Man gave me a balloon,""

 the boy continued, his words slurring. 

""He said... he said he had a surprise. Under the stage. But we went down. We went down so far.""

""Kid, listen to me. The Millennium Fair... that isn't happening now.""

""I want my mom,""

 he cried, a sudden, piercing shriek that made me pull the phone away from my ear. 

""It’s too tight! The walls are too tight!""

Click. Hum.

I stood in the hallway, shivering despite the summer heat trapped in the house. The Millennium Fair. I remembered it. Everyone in the county remembered it. It was a massive traveling carnival that had come through the state capital to celebrate the turn of the century. New Year's Eve, 1999.

I was in high school then. I remembered the lights, the sheer scale of it. But that was 26 years ago.

If this was a prank, it was incredibly specific and incredibly cruel. Why reference a fair that happened a 26 years ago? Was the kid reading a script? Or was it a recording?

I went to the kitchen and made coffee, my hands shaking as I poured the water. I spent the hours until dawn sitting at the kitchen table, staring at the phone in the hallway. I tried to rationalize it. A recording made more sense. Someone playing an old tape over the line? But the boy had responded to the flow of conversation, even if he didn't answer my questions directly.

When the sun came up, I drove to the library in the next town over—the only place with decent Wi-Fi. I needed to verify my memory.

I searched ""Millennium Fair kidnapping.""

The results were sparse. It had been a chaotic event. Too many people, too much alcohol, Y2K panic mixed with celebration. There were reports of fights, a few drug arrests, lost children who were found within hours.

But there was one cold case.

Michael Miller, age 7. Last seen near the exit of the fairgrounds, wearing a blue windbreaker and holding a red balloon. Witnesses reported seeing him walking with a costumed character, though no mascots were scheduled for that area of the park.

I stared at the grainy photo of the boy on the screen. He had a gap-toothed smile and messy hair.

Seven years old.

The boy on the phone sounded seven.

I went back to the house with a knot of dread in my gut so tight it made it hard to breathe. The house smelled worse today—a sharp, acrid tang of ammonia cutting through the dust. My father was sitting exactly where I’d left him, bathed in the static glow.

""Dad?""

 I asked, walking into the living room.

He didn't blink.

""Dad, did you ever hear about a boy going missing? Years ago? At a fair?""

Slowly, agonizingly, his head turned. His neck crunched, a dry, brittle sound. He looked at me, and for a second, the fog in his eyes seemed to clear, replaced by a sharp, predatory lucidness that I hadn't seen in years.

""Everyone goes missing eventually,"" 

he rasped. Then he turned back to the TV and let out a long, wheezing laugh that turned into a cough.

I decided then that I wouldn't answer the phone again. It was doing something to me. It was making the shadows in the corners of the room look like crouching figures. It was making the silence of the house sound like held breath. If it was a prank, I was feeding it. If it was... something else... I didn't want to let it in.

For the next three nights, the phone rang at 3:00 AM.

Brrr-ing.

Brrr-ing.

I lay in bed, pillow wrapped around my head, counting the rings. It always rang exactly ten times. Then silence.

But the silence was worse. Because in the silence, I started hearing other things. Sounds coming from inside the house.

A soft scraping sound. Like fabric dragging over wood.

It seemed to come from the ceiling.

By the fourth day of ignoring the calls, the atmosphere in the house had become unbearable. The air felt pressurized. My father was agitated, rocking back and forth in his chair, muttering about ""leaks"" and ""patches.""

I needed to do something productive. I needed to exert some control over this rotting environment. I decided to tackle the attic.

The attic hatch was in the hallway, right above the phone table. I hadn't been up there since I was a child. It was a forbidden zone, the place where my father stored his ""projects."" He was a handyman by trade, a tinkerer. He fixed things—toasters, radios, lawnmowers.

I pulled the cord, and the folding ladder creaked down, releasing a shower of dust and dead flies. I climbed up, coughing, clicking on the single bare bulb that hung from the rafters.

The attic was stiflingly hot, smelling of baked pine and fiberglass insulation. It was crammed with boxes, just like the rest of the house, but these were older. Wooden crates, metal footlockers.

I started moving things around, looking for space, looking for anything that could be thrown away. I found boxes of old tubes for radios, jars of rusted nails, a collection of license plates from the seventies.

And then I found the trunk.

It was pushed all the way into the eaves, hidden behind a stack of water-damaged insulation rolls. It was an old steamer trunk, heavy and bound in leather that had cracked like a dry riverbed.

I shouldn't have opened it. I knew that the moment my hand touched the latch. The metal was cold, unnaturally so for how hot the attic was.

I popped the latches. They groaned in protest. I threw the lid back.

The smell hit me first. It was the smell of the garage—motor oil, grease, gasoline—mixed with something biological. Sweat. Dried saliva. Unwashed hair.

Lying inside the trunk, folded haphazardly, was a suit.

It was made of a coarse, grey synthetic fur that had matted and clumped with age and grime. There were dark stains on the chest and stomach, stiff and crusty.

I reached out, my fingers trembling, and pulled it up.

It was a rabbit suit. But not a cute Easter bunny. This was something homemade, something stitched together with fishing line and desperation. The headpiece was heavy, made of papier-mâché covered in that same matted fur. The ears were long and asymmetrical, one bent sharply in the middle as if broken. The eyes were empty sockets, rimmed with red felt. The mouth was a fixed, jagged grin cut into the mask, revealing a mesh screen behind it that was clogged with... something dark.

I dropped it. I dropped it like it was burning.

""The Rabbit Man.""

The boy’s voice echoed in my head. 

I backed away, scrambling over the boxes, my heart hammering a frantic rhythm against my ribs. I couldn't breathe. The air in the attic was suddenly sucked out, replaced by the vacuum of realization.

My father.

My father, the handyman. The man who could fix anything. 

I scrambled down the ladder, nearly falling the last few feet. I hit the hallway floor and looked at the phone. It sat there, silent, accusing.

I ran into the living room. My father was there, bathed in the static.

""Dad,""

 I said, my voice shaking so hard it distorted the word.

He didn't move.

""Dad, what is in the attic?"" 

I shouted. 

""What is that suit?""

He stopped rocking. The static hissed. Shhhhhhh.

He slowly turned his chair. He didn't use his feet; he just shifted his weight, the old wood of the chair groaning. He faced me. His eyes were clear again. Lucid. Horribly, terrifyingly lucid.

He looked at me with a mixture of pity and annoyance, like I was a child interrupting an important meeting.

""I had to hide this part of me,"" 

he said. His voice was strong, devoid of the tremulous wheeze of the last few months.

 ""He was broken.""

I stared at him, my blood running cold.

 ""Who? Who was broken?""

""The boy,"" 

my father said. 

""He wouldn't stop crying. I tried to fix him. I tried to make him quiet. But he was broken inside.""

He smiled. It wasn't a fatherly smile. It was a baring of teeth, yellow and long.

""So I put him where the noise wouldn't bother me. ""

I stumbled back, bile rising in my throat.

 ""You... you killed him?""

""I fixed the problem,""

 he said, turning back to the TV. 

""Now, be quiet. The show is starting.""

He dissolved back into the slump, the clarity vanishing as quickly as it had come.

I ran to the kitchen. I needed to call the police. I grabbed my cell phone from my bag—dead battery. Of course. I hadn't charged it in weeks.

I looked at the hallway. The rotary phone.

I couldn't touch it. I couldn't go near it. But I had to. I had to call 911.

I approached the phone like it was a bomb. I lifted the receiver.

Silence. No dial tone.

I tapped the hook. Nothing. Dead air.

I checked the wall jack. The plastic clip was snapped in, tight.

""Come on,""

 I whispered, panic rising.

 ""Come on.""

I followed the cord. It wound from the back of the phone, coiled across the table, and dropped behind it.

I pulled the table away from the wall.

The cord didn't go into the wall jack.

The jack on the wall was empty. Painted over. This was new, when did this happened ?

The cord from the phone went down. It went through a crudely drilled hole in the floorboards, right next to the baseboard.

My mind couldn't process it. I had been getting calls. I had heard the ringing. I had spoken to the boy.

I fell to my knees. I grabbed the cord and pulled. It was taut. Anchored to something below.

I needed to see. I didn't want to, but the compulsion was a physical force, a hook in my navel pulling me forward.

I ran to the garage and grabbed a pry bar. I came back, the sound of my breathing loud and ragged in the silent house. My father was humming in the living room, a low, discordant tune.

I jammed the pry bar into the gap between the floorboards where the wire disappeared. The wood was old, but the nails screamed as they gave way.

Craaaack.

I levered up one board. Then another. The smell rushed up at me.

There was a space between the floor joists. But it wasn't just a crawlspace. It had been modified. Lined.

Egg cartons. layers and layers of them, glued to the joists and the subfloor. And acoustic foam. And old carpet scraps.

1qxnjl1,https://i.redd.it/5z3xjl0zpwhg1.png,Looking for link; Divorcing him after welcoming my sister,"# Divorcing Him After Welcoming My Sister

My husband, Zachary Larson, and I are holding a welcome dinner for my sister, Julia Scott. When someone asks what Julia's greatest regret is, she raises her glass and looks at Zachary dreamily. ""It's probably the time I wasn't brave enough to keep his child.""

Everyone starts to whisper amongst themselves. I tighten my grip on the pregnancy check-up report I'm about to reveal to them. 

My stomach twists with the emotions swirling in my head.

Julia suddenly returns to her senses and chuckles. 

""I was just kidding. We were only friends with benefits, so don't take it to heart, Queenie. He married you, so you're the one he loves.""

Chapter 1

All eyes were on Zachary Larson and me, but Zachary was looking at Julia Scott with eyes filled with pity. He didn't notice my pale face and trembling hands.

As if she was unaware of the tension in the air, Julia took a sip out of her glass and said affectionately, ""Come to think of it, Zachary used to have an awful temper. I was the one who turned him into the caring gentleman he is now—perfect for my beloved sister.""

She blinked teasingly. ""Queenie, does he still try to sleep with you when you're on your period or insist that you wear the condom on for him with your mouth?""

Zachary remained silent. He didn't object, so he must have agreed. 

He chuckled helplessly and pushed a plate of steak to Julia. ""Eat well. Since you're going to be my sister-in-law, listen to me and take good care of your body.""

It was as if he was blind to how upset I was. The suffocating tension around us didn't let up with Zachary's words and actions.

Julia's best friend, Layla Anderson, seemed oblivious to everything and chimed in.

""He's right, Julia. You're too picky with your food. You only eat what Zachary cooks for you.

""Back then, Zachary was so busy with work and frequently went on business trips. It made you so upset that you kept skipping meals. Your body couldn't handle it, so you lost your child.""

I stared blankly at the food in front of me. I finally realized why Zachary insisted on cooking.

We had been married for three years. If it weren't for Julia, I wouldn't have even known that the man I shared a bed with could cook, though.

After taking the time to admire the pale look on my face, Julia suddenly apologized with feigned innocence, ""I'm sorry, everyone. After not seeing them for three years, I ended up drinking so much. I also couldn't hold my tongue. I'll excuse myself and go freshen up.""

She wobbled as she stood up and accidentally spilled wine on her dress. 

Zachary immediately rose to his full height. He moved with practiced ease and said, ""I'll take you to your room so you can change.""

Enduring the pain in my stomach, I stood up and said, ""Let me help—""

He pushed my hand away with a frown. ""Don't. You'll just make things worse.""

My hand froze in midair. It brought me back to the time when I wanted to change the curtains in the living room after we got married.

Zachary rejected the idea back then, saying, ""It's too troublesome. Besides, didn't Julia say that this color's nice?""

In the end, we never changed them. Every corner of this home had another woman's touch.

They went into the guest room. After a while, she walked out of the room wearing his old dress shirt. The shirt highlighted her small frame and made her seem fragile.

She purposely rolled the sleeves up to show off an eye-catching men's watch on her wrist. It was the watch Zachary usually wore. 

I had gifted him the watch on our first wedding anniversary.

She shook her wrist and smiled at me. ""This watch looked pretty good, so I put it on to match this shirt. You don't mind it, do you, Queenie?"" 

Zachary looked at her with a soft smile. Then, he turned to me and said, ""It looks good on her.""

The pain in my stomach became excruciating. I dug my nails into my palms and swallowed the scream that almost escaped my mouth. The way they acted like they were the only ones in the room broke my heart.

I slowly sat back down and secretly scrunched up the pregnancy check-up report in my pocket. As I exhaled, the look in my eyes turned cold. I decided to talk to Zachary tonight.

Chapter 2

The dinner finally came to an end. 

Julia massaged her temples and said in a weak voice, ""Zachary, I think I caught a cold from drinking. I don't feel well. Can I…""

Zachary immediately replied, ""Just stay in the guest room. No need to push yourself to leave when it's already this late.""

He spoke as if it were only natural. 

I clenched my fists and remained silent.

…

The master bedroom felt cold and empty late at night as he had never returned.

Feeling increasingly unsettled, I got up to search for him. The door to the guest room was left ajar, allowing light and voices to slip out. I could hear Julia's tearful voice coming from inside the room.

""I was the one you cared about the most back then! There was a time when we fought, and you waited outside my dorm for an entire night!""

""Let's not mention the past. At least you're back now."" I had never heard Zachary's deep voice speak in such a soft tone.

""Zach, I'm still the person in your heart, aren't I? You only married Queenie to get back at me for losing your child, didn't you?""

I slammed the door open. Julia was lying in Zachary's arms, her eyes red and swollen. Zachary was affectionately rubbing circles on her back.

He frowned upon seeing me and asked in an annoyed tone, ""Why haven't you gone to bed?""

She hid behind him, clinging to his sleeve. She poked her head out just far enough to shoot me a taunting smirk.

My voice started to tremble. ""It's getting late, Zachary.""

Zachary became even more impatient. ""Julia isn't feeling well, so I'm staying with her. Can't you be the bigger person here and stop acting out?""

Julia added in a sickly, coquettish voice, ""Zachary, don't blame Queenie. It's my fault for getting drunk and running my mouth. No wonder she's upset…""

His heart ached. Immediately turning to me, he said, ""Julia has a weak body. If you're not going to sleep, stop standing around and make her some soup.""

I smiled despite my anger. ""I'm your wife, not her nanny.""

Zachary's expression darkened. ""Queenie Scott, why do you have to be so petty? Julia's your sister, for goodness' sake. 

""It's one thing if you don't care about her, but do you have to get so worked up over me caring for my sister-in-law?""

""Your sister-in-law?"" I felt a pang in my heart. ""It sure doesn't look like you only see her as your sister-in-law to me!""

Then, I left and returned to the master bedroom. 

After a while, Zachary came after me and apologized gently, ""I'm sorry, Queenie. Don't be angry. Julia lost a child because of me, after all."" He hugged me, kissed my forehead, and tried to comfort me with his words.

The tension in my body didn't leave. I wanted to ask him about Julia and him, but I was too tired to argue.

Thinking that I had calmed down, he left to do something else for a long time. Still uneasy, I secretly went after him, following the noises he was making.

Zachary walked into the study and made a call. He said as quietly as he could, ""Allocate our funds for the project in Synclaria City to Julia's new studio instead. She just came back, so she needs our support.""

I was shocked. Our team pulled so many all-nighters to win that project! It was one of our core projects!

The person on the other end of the line asked a question. Zachary chuckled. His tone was extremely gentle as he replied, ""It's fine. She's worth the loss we'll suffer… What about Ms. Scott? Don't worry about it. She's my wife. She won't go against my decision.""

Chapter 3

I leaned against the cold wall. My limbs felt cold as my tears fell onto the floor.

Not only did he have Julia in his heart, but he even served the product of our hard work to her on a silver platter. I couldn't sleep all night, so my legs were unsteady when I walked out of the bedroom the next morning.

Julia was already sitting in the dining room, drinking coffee. She looked up at me and smiled. 

Her fingers subtly traced along the base of her neck, where a shiny diamond necklace sat.

My breathing hitched. I had seen that necklace before.

Three years ago, Zachary saved up three months' worth of salary to buy a bracelet. That necklace belonged to the same set as the bracelet.

Back then, he said with me in his arms, ""Queenie, when we get rich, I'll buy the entire 'My One and Only' jewelry set for you.""

Caressing the pendant, Julia asked sweetly, ""Queenie, do you think this necklace is pretty? Zach said this one's named 'My One and Only'. He said it's a welcome gift for me and insisted I try it on this morning.""

She tilted her head and smirked with feigned innocence. ""It seems to belong to the same set as your bracelet. How wonderful! It's so kind of him to give us a matching set!""

My stomach churned and started to ache. Black spots filled my vision.

I could feel warm liquid seeping through my nightgown. The liquid cooled and stuck to my skin. When I looked down, I saw red everywhere.

I immediately broke out into a cold sweat. Trembling, I held onto Zachary as he passed by with all my strength. ""Zach… My stomach hurts…""

As Zachary stared down at me, I saw no sense of urgency in his eyes, only impatience and suspicion. He shook my hand off and asked, ""Are you seriously playing sick right after Julia started to feel better? I already gave you so much jewelry. Why are you so hung up on that specific necklace?""

The words he tearfully said when he proposed to me echoed in my mind. ""I'll trust and protect you forever,"" were the exact words.

Now, they felt like knives cutting into my body. The hope in my eyes slowly faded away.

Perhaps because of my pale complexion and the huge amount of blood, Zachary seemed to return to his senses and calm down. Then, he frowned and leaned in to carry me.

Suddenly, Julia groaned and pressed a hand to her forehead. She wobbled as if she were about to faint. ""Zach… I feel dizzy…""

He immediately made his choice. He turned and steadied Julia. Then, he asked in a panicked tone, ""What's wrong?""

Julia leaned into his arms and weakly pointed at the kitchen counter. Someone had placed what looked like a bag of blood there at some point. It was punctured and dripping red liquid.

""I accidentally spotted it when I went to fetch Queenie a glass of water…"" She panted and cried crocodile tears. 

""Queenie, you're still angry at me, aren't you? That's why you purposely…"" She clung to Zachary's sleeve and sobbed. 

""It's all my fault. Zachary, leave me be and check up on Queenie! She must have been so angry that she planned this to get your attention. I'm fine. You don't need to worry about me…""

Zachary's face turned ashen. Anger instantly drowned out the worry he felt for me.

He turned to glare at me and scolded, ""Do you have to make a fuss now? If anything happens to Julia, I'll make you pay!""

Since I managed to pull three all-nighters in a row with him when we worked on a project together, he was sure I was not as weak as Julia, who had lost his child because of her frail body. 

Scooping Julia up into a bridal carry, he rushed out the door, leaving me curled up on the floor in a puddle of my own blood. 

I heard him close his car door with a slam. Then, he started the engine and sped away.

The world fell silent. My heart shattered into pieces.

Chapter 4

I used my last shred of energy to feel around the floor for my phone and call an ambulance. Then, I woke up to the smell of disinfectant.

It felt like there was an empty hole in my body. It was cold and painful.

I instinctively touched my stomach. The flat surface made me anxious.

A nurse walked in and said in a practiced tone, ""You're finally awake. I'm sorry, but you had a miscarriage. My condolences for your child. Please take care.""

My condolences? When Zachary had abandoned me to bleed and suffer alone, my child had left without a trace.

As the effects of the anesthetic faded away, my heart ached with my wound. I picked up my phone and saw zero notifications.

There weren't any missed calls from Zachary. He didn't even leave any concerned messages or an explanation for me. 

There was nothing.

In the silence of the room, memories flooded my mind. I remembered the time he stood in the rain with nothing but an umbrella to wait for me to get off work. He was so drenched that he looked like a drowned rat.

I also remembered the time he stayed up late to bake me a birthday cake. With flour smudging his face, he smiled like a fool.

Then, there was the time he got down on one knee, held a ring out to me with trembling hands, and said, ""Marry me. I'll spend the rest of my life making you happy."" 

The warm and happy memories all faded into the memory of him carrying Julia and yelling at me with a scowl. Perhaps Julia was right.

He only used me to get back at her. I was just her replacement.

With my heart thoroughly broken, I felt oddly calm.

I called and summoned my secretary. Then, I calmly signed the resignation letter and the share sale documents I had asked her to prepare last night.

After that, I called my lawyer. ""Alex, please bring the divorce papers I consulted you about last night.

""That's right. Now. I'm at the gynecology department in Illeson Medical Center.""

…

Alex arrived very quickly. 

I accepted the divorce papers he handed me and flipped to the last page. I signed my name without hesitation. The tip of my pen cut both the paper and the ties between Zachary and me.

A while after I left, the door to my hospital room slammed open. 

Zachary had finally arrived. His hair was messy. He looked like he was in a rush and annoyed. ""The nurse just called me. What's up with you? Don't be so…""

He suddenly fell silent. His gaze swept past the empty bed and landed on the nightstand, where a document sat. ""Divorce Settlement Agreement"" were the words at the top of the first page.

Beside the document lay the aftercare instructions for miscarriage. On top of the divorce papers was the wedding ring I had never once taken off.

Beneath the ring was a note. Zachary stiffly pulled it out.

I had written the sentence down with all my energy. The note read, ""Zachary, your inability to let go of her killed our child.""",1,1770397992.0,Novelnews,4,1.0,False

I don’t want a divorce but I’m losing hope that my marriage will get better. We’ve been to counseling twice and it didn’t stick. Now my partner is resistant to further counseling. We’ve been dealing with the same damaging issues for 5+ years. (No abuse.) I feel hopeless and heartbroken. 

I’m a total wreck and I feel like I have no one to talk to about it. It feels like such an Evansville thing, because between me and my husband there is a ton of overlap in  social circles that makes me hesitant

to share. Imagine scenarios like - I’m friends with the wife but he’s best friends with the husband, or one of my close girlfriends who’s gone through a divorce is also someone he supervises at work. 

I do have friends who don’t live around here or aren’t close with my husband, but those are also the friend I haven’t been good at keeping in touch with. And because this has been going on so long, anybody I tell would probably be pretty shocked and overwhelmed because nobody has any clue. Doesn’t mean I can’t tell them, but it makes me feel that much more awkward about it. “hey, I know I haven’t checked it with you other than yearly for the last several years, but I’d like to call you now and trauma dump for the next few hours.”

I’ve tried individual counseling and I’m not opposed to it, but I really just want to talk to other women who are going through this. It seems like everywhere I look I just see these really happy marriages and it’s making me feel so alone. I’m not even talking social media image wise; I know that’s easy to fake. These are couples I know and they genuinely seem really in love and supportive. I haven’t felt like that in years.

Are there any support groups people who aren’t already divorced? Like, I may not even get a divorce, so I don’t want to go into a space where it’s not really “for “me. 

Also, I know things like this are led through churches sometimes. I’m not opposed to that completely, but definitely would not feel supported anywhere that’s gonna have a belief like your husband is the spiritual leader of your household or whatever.

I am a 20 year old girl, and I don't know how to think of myself anymore. I always thought I was okay, and that as long as I tried to be positive everything would always be okay. It didn't matter if I struggled with depression, anxiety, PTSD, or anything because I knew at the end of the day my family and friends loved me for me. I was wrong. They love me, but they don't like me. They liked the me from before I moved out, before I ""regressed"", and I don't know. I have a lot of feelings, but I can't quite figure them out. 

I used to act mature, like I knew everything, I didn't need help, didn't need any attention, because everything would always be fine in the end so all that attention should be directed to my older sister and little brother who needed it more. I know nothing. Things I did know, I've forgotten. I am uneducated about sex, and I'm okay with that. Because I don't plan on ever having sex. I don't know things about drugs because I don't ever plan on doing them. I've never been in a romantic relationship, I've never understood flirting, I don't know how to do it or when others are doing it, but apparently the way I act can be perceived that way. Apparently it's always been that way and no one told me until yesterday night. 

I am number four out of five, my older brother has been married most of my life. His wife is my sister. When my parents explained to me as a child that those people my siblings were dating would just be bonus siblings I took that as how I was meant to treat them I guess. Like friends or siblings? My oldest  sister has also been married to her husband for most of my life, but my oldest sister has never been close with me. Even as kids when she was in highschool and I was a toddler, the closeness didn't exist. Last time I saw her for longer than a weekend was like 5 years ago, I saw her recently and that was the antithesis to all this. Apparently even as a kid I acted ""interested"" or like I was ""flirting"" with my in-laws. Joking with them, talking with them, and apparently touching them. When I would've first met these two in laws I was 10/11, so I really didn't notice. Recently my other older sister got married, and I just treated him the same way. Trying to joke, talk, and apparently touching. I didn't notice these things, I didn't notice I made anyone uncomfortable and for that I'm sorry. That I didn't see I was doing things wrong. Because if my constant need to talk, my need to make jokes when it gets quiet, and the way I tap people or touch people to get their attention before I say something or show them a meme on my phone is flirting then I've been flirting my entire life. And I didn't know. I have never known. I'm so confused, I thought I was just being friendly by trying to be friends with my sisters spouse but I was wrong. 

Since I moved out, I have regressed I'll admit that. But as it stands I don't see an issue with it. I never got to act childish when I was an actual child. Because if I did I'd get told to stop and act more mature. People always said I was wise beyond my years, but in hindsight that was just the trauma. That was me pretending I was old enough to not need help. I don't need to go buy bras it's okay, I'll just wear a tank top beneath my hoodies and shirts. Aw man, I got my period, but I don't need help with that I have an idea of what I'm supposed to do when I start bleeding out of my crotch. If I can act like a stupid kid at least until I'm 23 I think maybe that's okay. Because I'm a college kid. Finally getting to go out with friends to study at libraries, and coffee shops. Going thrifting, staying up way too late, running to class because I woke up late, finally getting to feel like I AM my age. I'm 20, and I don't know anything, and I thought that was okay. I like reading YA romance books because they don't include sex. I'm fine with people having sex, it's just me. I don't like the idea or thought of ME having sex which my family also doesn't get. They don't get how I've read books with sex, or watched movies with sex, but I don't want to have sex. I'm ace, but yeah I guess. Idk. I understand where my sister was coming from that I need to ""grow the fuck up"" but for once I liked myself. I felt like I was acting my age, and like I was happy, and now I'm rethinking every interaction I've ever had in my life because touching someone to get their attention was always just what I did. Not like grabbing someone, but waving my hand near them to get them to look, or tapping them, stuff like that. If that was flirting I need to correct that asap because I thought (and especially with my hearing problems) that was was okay. That that's how you get people's attention, that's how people always got my attention. I've always been uncomfortable with silence, so I'm always talking. I'm always joking. Even when I'm alone in my room, or there's no one home, I'm joking and talking to the walls. I didn't realize there were things wrong with that, but there are. I need to fix those things. I don't know how. All I can think to do is distance myself from my sister's. Because my brother hasn't said any of these things about how I treat his wife. Yesterday the discussion where all this was told to me was by my mom and my older (not oldest) sister. It wasn't like an intervention or something, it just came up. Because my older sister, her husband, and I had gone on a road trip to see my oldest sister, her husband, and kids. I wanted to talk about some things that happened on that trip, because on that trip, and as of right now, I've never felt so bad about myself.

Someone told me proposal work is where “judgment” shows up. And sometimes it is. There’s real thinking in shaping an approach, teasing out risk, picking what *not* to say, and making the story coherent

But an embarrassing amount of time is just… admin cosplay

I spend hours doing document archaeology: extracting requirements, reconciling conflicting asks across attachments, chasing SMEs for evidence, rewording the same answer three different ways so it maps to three different scoring rubrics. Then I lose another chunk of time because someone’s convinced the evaluator is allergic to the word “assumption”

And when the response quality is bad, everyone blames the other side. Procurement says vendors are vague. Vendors say the RFP is vague. In my experience, both are usually right

What I’ve seen “in the wild” to survive this ranges from chaotic to semi-functional: Excel trackers, SharePoint folder rituals, Bidara ai for requirement extraction + compliance traceability, giant Word docs with 40 tracked-change authors, Copilot/ChatGPT for first drafts, Grammarly, a random internal script someone wrote in Python, “Responsive/Loopio/RFPIO” depending on the org, even teams using Cursor to crank out repeatable sections faster. One team even swore by nothing except a ruthless response template and a hard page limit

None of that is “the strategy.” It just keeps you from drowning in hygiene work long enough to do the strategic part

I know nothing. Things I did know, I've forgotten. I am uneducated about sex, and I'm okay with that. Because I don't plan on ever having sex. I don't know things about drugs because I don't ever plan on doing them. I've never been in a romantic relationship, I've never understood flirting, I don't know how to do it or when others are doing it, but apparently the way I act can be perceived that way. Apparently it's always been that way and no one told me until yesterday night. 

I am number four out of five, my older brother has been married most of my life. His wife is my sister. When my parents explained to me as a child that those people my siblings were dating would just be bonus siblings I took that as how I was meant to treat them I guess. Like friends or siblings? My oldest  sister has also been married to her husband for most of my life, but my oldest sister has never been close with me. Even as kids when she was in highschool and I was a toddler, the closeness didn't exist. Last time I saw her for longer than a weekend was like 5 years ago, I saw her recently and that was the antithesis to all this. Apparently even as a kid I acted ""interested"" or like I was ""flirting"" with my in-laws. Joking with them, talking with them, and apparently touching them. When I would've first met these two in laws I was 10/11, so I really didn't notice. Recently my other older sister got married, and I just treated him the same way. Trying to joke, talk, and apparently touching. I didn't notice these things, I didn't notice I made anyone uncomfortable and for that I'm sorry. That I didn't see I was doing things wrong. Because if my constant need to talk, my need to make jokes when it gets quiet, and the way I tap people or touch people to get their attention before I say something or show them a meme on my phone is flirting then I've been flirting my entire life. And I didn't know. I have never known. I'm so confused, I thought I was just being friendly by trying to be friends with my sisters spouse but I was wrong. 

Since I moved out, I have regressed I'll admit that. But as it stands I don't see an issue with it. I never got to act childish when I was an actual child. Because if I did I'd get told to stop and act more mature. People always said I was wise beyond my years, but in hindsight that was just the trauma. That was me pretending I was old enough to not need help. I don't need to go buy bras it's okay, I'll just wear a tank top beneath my hoodies and shirts. Aw man, I got my period, but I don't need help with that I have an idea of what I'm supposed to do when I start bleeding out of my crotch. If I can act like a stupid kid at least until I'm 23 I think maybe that's okay. Because I'm a college kid. Finally getting to go out with friends to study at libraries, and coffee shops. Going thrifting, staying up way too late, running to class because I woke up late, finally getting to feel like I AM my age. I'm 20, and I don't know anything, and I thought that was okay. I like reading YA romance books because they don't include sex. I'm fine with people having sex, it's just me. I don't like the idea or thought of ME having sex which my family also doesn't get. They don't get how I've read books with sex, or watched movies with sex, but I don't want to have sex. I'm ace, but yeah I guess. Idk. I understand where my sister was coming from that I need to ""grow the fuck up"" but for once I liked myself. I felt like I was acting my age, and like I was happy, and now I'm rethinking every interaction I've ever had in my life because touching someone to get their attention was always just what I did. Not like grabbing someone, but waving my hand near them to get them to look, or tapping them, stuff like that. If that was flirting I need to correct that asap because I thought (and especially with my hearing problems) that was was okay. That that's how you get people's attention, that's how people always got my attention. I've always been uncomfortable with silence, so I'm always talking. I'm always joking. Even when I'm alone in my room, or there's no one home, I'm joking and talking to the walls. I didn't realize there were things wrong with that, but there are. I need to fix those things. I don't know how. All I can think to do is distance myself from my sister's. Because my brother hasn't said any of these things about how I treat his wife. Yesterday the discussion where all this was told to me was by my mom and my older (not oldest) sister. It wasn't like an intervention or something, it just came up. Because my older sister, her husband, and I had gone on a road trip to see my oldest sister, her husband, and kids. I wanted to talk about some things that happened on that trip, because on that trip, and as of right now, I've never felt so bad about myself. 

Idk
I don't know how to change
or what to do

Nagkita kami nung partner ng tropa ko kahapon for coffee, sa akin niya nalaman na hindi totoo yung mga paalam sa kaniya ng tropa ko, and sobrang lalim ng pagsisinungalling sa kaniya ng tropa ko


Context:
Hello! So ayon nga, nasa isang friendgroup kasi kami, 8 kami to be exact. Bale ganito set-up namin: Ako - John (magjowa), Mae - Judas (magjowa), Marie - Carl (magjowa), Marisol - Bonjing (si Bonjing main character natin d2) magtropa lang. Sa group namin, ako yung youngest, 20 lang me, tapos ages nila ay ranging from 24-27, si Marisol naman ay 29 na.

Last week, inadd ako ng partner ni Bonjing. Tapos ang atake nung account ay parang dump kasi 7 friends lang tapos walang posts or anything. Then nung isang araw, nagsunod-sunod sad posting niya, ako naman as concerned na tao – i don’t do this to gather chika, literally i’m like this to my fb friends – i messaged her na sana she’s doing alright, and i’m a stranger who wishes her to be okay. 

Nagreply siya sa akin, morning na. Nagthank you siya and all, and dun na kami nagstart mag-usap kasi she was really emotional at the time. Si Bonjing daw, nagsisinungaling sa kaniya kasi nakita story ko na kumain kami sa labas, tapos hindi pala niya alam yun, like wala siyang idea. Ang paalam lang sa kaniya ay lalabas siya at gagabihin umuwi. Tapos itong si Marisol pala, lamat na ng relasyon nila, July 2025 pa, pinagseselosan niya at reason pa ng saglit na paghihiwalay nila – hindi sila makapaghiwalay nang tuluyan kasi may anak sila, nakiusap lang ang nanay ni Bonjing kay girl na mag-ayos para sa bata – edi ayon na nga.

We talked for hours, tapos sabi niya, “inom nga tayo mga minsan,” ganon, to which I replied na “Coffee shop date tayo later!” Then ayon, nagkita kami sa coffee shop.

And ito yung ilan sa mga nareveal ko sakaniya na reason kung bakit super nahurt siya; Una, ang paalam sa kaniya, nagcocommute daw si Marisol at hindi niya hinahatid-sundo sa bahay nila, pero ang totoo sinusundo at hinahatid si Marisol nang door-to-door, Ikalawa, simula nung nagget-together sa bahay nina John (hindi ako kasama that time), nagsimula maglagay ng password si Bonjing. Hindi naman daw ganon yun dati, tapos hindi daw niya alam na ang naandon lang ay mga tropa kasi ang paalam ay kasama lahat ng kawork, 2 towns away yung bahay nina John. Ikatlo, sobrang galante niya daw sa aming mga kaibigan niya, pero sa kanila ng anak niya, 100 per day lang budget, buong sahod ng guy, kung hindi sa motor napupunta ay para sa sarili niya. Tapos pag sa amin, g magpautang, pero pag sa kanila daw, pag-iisipan sa pera. Last na ‘to, pero may marami pa kaming ibang napag-usapan — 8 hours a day na nga daw magkakasama (workmates sila, ako at si Marie lang ang hindi), ni maisipan daw sila bilhan ng foods, wala; kapag inaaya daw niya kumain sa mga kainan sa labas, dadahilan sa kaniya ay walang pera, kaya g na g siya nung nakita niya story ko na kumakain sa labas. Kasi sa kanila, halos tipidin, halos walang maibigay na foods, tapos pagdating daw sa amin ay todo go sa mga yayaan.

I felt really bad for her, sobrang dami pa pagsisinungaling ng tropa ko, at yung fact na akala ko okay si Bonjing kasi sobrang okay siya sa amin, sobrang mixed feelings ako nun. We talked for hours sa coffee shop, tapos nung umuwi kami ng gabi, minessage ako ng fam member ni Bonjing, kasi umiyak daw sa kaniya partner ni Bonjing, tapos cinonfront daw nila si Marisol.

Nagulat ako kasi ang gusto ko lang naman maging open and honest kay ate girl, ayoko naman mainvolve sa away pamilya nila huhu. Ngayon, kinukutuban ako na alam na ni Bonjing at Marisol na ako yung nakausap ni ate girl. Feeling ko nakasira ako ng relasyon, tapos baka kasalanan ko pa pag naghiwalay yung dalawa at nawalan ng tatay anak nila huhu.

Sabi ng partner ko (John), sana daw di na ako nakidawdaw sa buhay nila, pero wala eh, ayoko naman maging patay malisya lalo na kung mali na nangyayari diba 😭

So ang tanong ko ngayon is, paano ko haharapin mga tropa ko sa mga following events namin. Hindi ko alam kung keri ko ba, baka may hidden galit na sila sa akin ngayon or whatsoever, di me makasleep pag-iisip huhu.


Previous Attempts: 
Wala pa huhu, eerily quiet ang GC ng tropa namin ngayon, kaya hindi ko talaga alam what to do 🥹

I had a fun week traveling. I was out of state, in Saudi. Got to do alot of fun things but my favorite was trying out lots of different food. If anyone knows what I’m talking about but it’s ‘trendy’ in food video content, a whole camel over rice. I got to try that and real Dubai chocolate. Amazing. If I didn’t travel for a living as work I’d be jet lag right now but I’m fine!

I did gymnastics when I was in high school. Still jumping on trampolines and doing yoga to keep my athleticism. Combine that with going to the gym now and you get a pretty insane combination lol. I’m blonde so call it buff Barbie. My favorite color is also pink.

I been feeling bored lately and thought it might be fun to open up a trading card shop. For the vibes. But not like any other card shop, I got some creative ideas. A coffee station, a lounging area, a mini gym area, a pool area, a sky deck with a pool, VIP area. I know, it’s unheard of but I got a layout in mind and I actually think it would be pretty dope. Pokemon, One Piece, Yu-Gi-Oh, Sports cards, I want to offer it all and have playing nights too.

This was our second visit, and overall it’s a very good resort with extremely friendly and hardworking staff.

# Positives

* Beautiful beach with calm water and no big waves, and plenty of palm trees providing natural shade.
* Food is generally good; the Spanish, Italian, Mexican, and Japanese restaurants were excellent. The other restaurants were good, though not outstanding. The buffet is average and can get crowded; however, the buffet at the adults-only resort on the other side is much better and we mostly ate there.  Buffet upstairs for My Barcelo members is good too.
* Great second-floor bar (Carey) with a nice ambiance and good drinks.
* On both of our stays, we did not encounter any annoying timeshare salespeople, which was a big plus.

# Negatives

* The Junior Suite is spacious and includes an ocean-facing balcony with a jacuzzi, and the beach-side location was excellent. However, the bathroom layout is terrible, with almost no privacy—very awkward when sharing a room.
* The resort is huge, so expect a lot of walking. We averaged about 15,000 steps a day, which we enjoyed, but it may be challenging for guests with mobility issues.
* There are no convenient coffee or snack stations in the buildings; you have to walk to the main building for morning coffee or afternoon snacks. The golf-cart train runs between buildings, but is not very regular.
* Restaurant reservations are frustrating, with limited time slots usually before 6 pm or after 10 pm.

# Final Thought

The staff truly make this place special. Please tip whenever possible—they work very hard and are generally very attentive.",2,1770397103.0,PuntaCana,4,0.63,False

Six Months After
AYAN
March. Six months since the mountain.
I still didn't know why I'd gone there. Tried to piece it together. Found the train ticket stub. October 23rd. Found notes in my apartment. Research about atmospheric anomalies. Meteor near-misses. Time distortions.
Found sketches. Hundreds of them. All of the same shrine.
I'd been obsessed with something. But I couldn't remember what.
My coworker said I'd changed after that week. ""You were different before,"" he said. ""Distant, yeah, but also... lighter somehow. Like you had a secret. Now you're just...""
""Just what?""
He shrugged. ""Sad.""
Was I sad? I felt hollow. Like I'd lost something important. But I didn't know what.
I kept drawing the shrine. Couldn't stop. Every evening at 6:42, I'd find myself at my window. Waiting. For what? I didn't know. But I waited anyway.
HINA
March. Six months since the landslide.
Official report said I was lucky. Should have been there when the rocks fell. Somehow wasn't. Somehow survived. But I couldn't remember how.
Grandmother said I'd changed. ""You're quieter,"" she said. ""Before, you were waiting for something. Now you're mourning something.""
""I'm not mourning,"" I said.
""Aren't you?""
Was I? I felt empty. Like I'd lost someone. But who?
I kept the shrine open every evening until 6:42. Didn't know why. Just felt wrong to close earlier. Like I was supposed to be there. Waiting for someone. But no one ever came.



The First Shift Returns:-
AYAN
One evening in September. Almost a year since the mountain.
I was at my window at 6:42 like always. Waiting for nothing.
Then—
The light shifted. Just for a second. Just a breath. Colors went strange. Gravity tilted. Sound dulled.
Exactly like— Like something. Something I couldn't remember.
It lasted maybe thirty seconds. Then stopped.
I stood there shaking. That feeling. I'd felt it before. When? Couldn't remember. But it had mattered. God, it had mattered.
I sat down on my floor. Started crying. Still didn't know why. But now I was certain: I'd lost something real. Something impossible. Something important.
HINA
Same evening. September. 6:42 PM.
I was at the shrine like always. Lighting the evening candles.
Then—
The light shifted. Just for a moment. The wind chime rang. Wrong note. Colors changed. Gravity tilted.
Exactly like— Like something I'd forgotten.
It lasted maybe thirty seconds. Then faded.
I stood there. Breathing hard. That feeling. I'd felt it before. Many times before. When? Couldn't remember. But it had been everything.
I looked at the wind chime. Still swaying slightly. Reached up. Touched it. It was warm. Like someone had just been here. Like someone had just left.
I started crying. Because now I knew for certain: Someone had been here. Someone had mattered. And I couldn't remember who.



The Search Begins:-
AYAN
That night, I couldn't sleep. Kept thinking about the shift. That thirty-second moment. It had felt like confirmation. Like someone saying: ""It was real."" Whatever ""it"" was.
I started going through my old research. The meteor. October 2024. The shrine. Found my search history from that week. Names I'd looked up. Places. Articles.
One search stood out: ""Hina Nakamura obituary""
I stared at it. Clicked.
""Local Shrine Keeper Dies in Landslide — October 23, 2024""
But wait. I looked at the date on my computer. September 2027. Checked the article again. October 23, 2024. Three years ago.
She'd died three years ago. So why had I searched for her obituary in October 2026? A year after she died?
Unless—
I clicked another link. Updated article.
""Shrine Keeper Survives Landslide — Official Report Released""
""Hina Nakamura, originally reported dead, was found alive near the shrine. Landslide occurred at 6:42 PM but Nakamura was several meters away from the impact site. Cause of displacement unknown.""
She survived. But I'd searched for her death. Why? What had I known? What had I done?
HINA
I kept a journal after the shift returned. Didn't know why. Just felt important to document.
September 15, 2027
The light changed today. Just for thirty seconds. Like before. Like something I can't remember. I don't know what it means. But I feel less alone.
I started writing every day.
September 20, 2027
I can't shake the feeling I'm waiting for someone. Who? Why can't I remember?
October 1, 2027
Three years since the landslide. I should be dead. I know I should be dead. But I'm not. Why? Who saved me?
I flipped through the pages. Realized I'd been writing the same questions for months. Who? Why? What did I lose?


The Years Between:-
AYAN
I started traveling. Didn't know why. Just felt like I needed to find something.
Visited shrines across the country. Mountain shrines specifically. Looking for... What?
Kept a notebook. Sketched each shrine. None of them felt right.
My coworker asked what I was doing.
""Searching,"" I said.
""For what?""
""I don't know.""
""Then how will you know when you find it?""
I thought about it. ""I'll just know.""
He thought I was crazy. Maybe I was. But I couldn't stop.
HINA
I left the shrine. First time in my life.
Grandmother supported it. ""You need to find what you're looking for,"" she said.
""I don't know what that is.""
""You will.""
I moved to the city. Felt pulled there. Didn't know why.
Got a job at a small bookstore. Simple work. Quiet. But every evening at 6:42, I'd stop whatever I was doing. Stand still. Wait. For nothing.
My coworkers thought it was odd. I didn't care. It felt necessary.




Five Years Later:-
AYAN
Five years since the mountain.
I returned to the city. Hadn't been home in almost two years. Felt like it was time.
Got my old apartment back. Same window. Same view. Same sunset.
Everything was familiar. But I still felt like a stranger. Like I was living someone else's life.
Still drew the shrine sometimes. Still waited at 6:42. Still felt that hollow ache. But quieter now. More bearable. Like I'd learned to live with the absence. Even if I didn't understand it.
HINA
Five years since the landslide.
Still in the city. Still at the bookstore. Still waiting for something I couldn't name. But I'd gotten used to it. The incompleteness. The sense that part of me was missing.
I'd learned to function around it. Made friends. Had routines. Lived.
But that feeling never left. That sense that I was supposed to be somewhere else. With someone else. Doing something else.
But I didn't know what. Or who. Or where. Just that I was here. And they were somewhere. And we were supposed to be together.




SEPTEMBER 15, 2029
(Five years since the brief shift returned)
(Ten years since the blue hour began)
AYAN
Sunday. Normal day. Went for a walk. Needed to clear my head.
Ended up at the train station. Central station. Crowded. Rush hour ending. People everywhere.
I'd just come back from a weekend trip. Another shrine visit. Still searching. Still not finding.
Carrying my bag. Tired. Ready to go home.
Started walking toward the exit. Through the main platform.
6:41 PM. Almost time. Almost—
HINA
Sunday. Normal day. Closing shift at the bookstore. Walking to the train station. Going home.
Crowded platform. People everywhere. I was tired. Long day. Ready to rest.
Started walking toward Platform 3. Through the main concourse.
6:41 PM. One minute until— Until what? I didn't know. But I felt it coming. Something. Someone.
6:42
AYAN
I was walking through the crowd. Dodging people. Checking my phone. Not really paying attention.
Then— 6:42.
There. That feeling. The one I'd been waiting for. For five years. For longer.
Something shifted. Not the light. Not gravity. Not sound. Just— Presence. Like someone was there. Someone important.
I stopped walking. Mid-step. Looked up. Scanned the crowd. Where? Where was it coming from?
HINA
6:42.
There.
I stopped walking. Didn't choose to. Just— Stopped. Like my body knew before my mind did.
Someone was here. Someone important. I could feel it. Like gravity pulling me. Not physically. Emotionally. Toward— Where?
I turned slowly. Scanned the crowd. Hundreds of people. Moving. Talking. Existing. But one of them— One of them was—



The Meeting:-
AYAN
I saw her.
Twenty meters away. Standing still. In the middle of the moving crowd. Looking around. Looking for something.
Our eyes met.
And— Oh. Oh god.
My chest— I couldn't breathe. Couldn't move. Couldn't think. Just— Her.
It was her. I didn't know how I knew. Didn't know why. But I knew. With absolute certainty. Her.
HINA
I saw him.
Standing in the crowd. Staring at me. Frozen.
And— Oh. My heart— It was pounding. Tears— Why was I crying?
I didn't— I'd never seen him before. Had I?
But— But— I knew him. Somehow I knew him.
(The world continues around them. People passing. Trains departing. Announcements echoing. But they don't hear any of it.)



The Approach:-
AYAN
I started walking. Toward her. Slowly. Like moving through water.
Every step felt impossible. And necessary.
She was walking too. Toward me. Same slow, deliberate steps.
Fifteen meters. Ten.
My hands were shaking. I was crying. Didn't know why. Couldn't stop.
Five meters.
She was crying too. Face wet. Eyes wide. Looking at me. Seeing me.
Three meters.
I stopped. She stopped.
We stood there. In the middle of the station. Strangers. Crying at each other.
HINA
""I—"" I tried to speak. Voice breaking. ""I'm sorry, I don't— I don't know why I'm—""
He shook his head. ""Me neither,"" he said.
His voice. I knew his voice. How did I know his voice?
""Have we—"" I started. Couldn't finish.
""I don't think so,"" he said. But he didn't sound sure. Looked at me like— Like he'd been searching for me. For years.
""This is crazy,"" I said. Laughed through tears.
He laughed too. ""Completely.""
We stood there. Just staring. Just feeling.


The Touch:-
AYAN
My hand moved. Before I could think about it. Reaching toward her.
And she— She reached back.
Our fingers touched.
And— God. Oh god.
It was like— Like coming home. Like finding something I'd lost. Like breathing after drowning. Like— Everything.
I grabbed her hand fully. Held on. She held back. Tight. Like if we let go we'd disappear.
""I'm Ayan,"" I said. Voice shaking. Barely audible.
She was crying harder now.
""Hina,"" she whispered.
Hina. The name hit me like lightning. Hina. I knew that name. I knew it. But from where? When?
HINA
Ayan. His name echoed in my head. Ayan.
I knew it. Somehow I knew it. But I'd never heard it before. Had I?
We were still holding hands. Still crying. Still standing in the middle of the station. People were staring. We didn't care.
""I feel like—"" I started.
""Like you've been looking for me,"" he finished.
""Yes.""
""Me too.""
""How is that possible?""
""I don't know.""
We stood there. Just holding hands. Just being. Together. Finally. Even though we didn't understand why.





Coffee:-
AYAN
""Can I—"" I tried to speak normally. Failed. ""Can I buy you coffee?""
She laughed. Still crying. ""I'd like that,"" she said. ""I'd really like that.""
We started walking. Hand in hand. Through the station. Neither of us let go. Couldn't. Physically couldn't release each other. Like our hands had been waiting for this. For years.
We found a small cafe. Sat across from each other. Still holding hands across the table.
""I don't understand this,"" she said.
""Neither do I.""
""But I feel like—""
""Like this is the most important moment of your life,"" I said.
She stared at me. ""Yes. Exactly yes.""
We sat there. Just existing together. And for the first time in five years— Since that mountain I couldn't remember— I felt whole.



The Sharing:-
HINA
We talked for hours. Closed the cafe. Moved to a park. Sat on a bench. Still holding hands.
Shared everything. Where we lived. What we did. Our families.
But also—
""Do you ever feel like you're missing something?"" I asked.
""Every day,"" he said immediately.
""Me too.""
""Like there's a gap somewhere.""
""Yes. Exactly.""
""Do you wait at 6:42?"" he asked.
I froze. ""How did you know that?""
He shook his head. ""I don't know. I just— I do too. Every day. Stand at my window and wait.""
""For what?""
""I don't know. Do you know what you're waiting for?""
""No. But it feels like someone.""
He squeezed my hand. ""What if it was me?""
""What if it was you?""
""What if we were waiting for each other?""
I looked at him. Really looked at him. ""That's impossible.""
""I know.""
""We've never met before.""
""I know.""
""So why does it feel like I've known you forever?""
He started crying again. ""I don't know. But I feel it too.""





The Walk:-
AYAN
We walked through the city until midnight. Just talking. Just being together.
At one point, we passed a shop window. Saw our reflection. Holding hands.
She squeezed my hand. ""We look like we belong together,"" she said quietly.
""We do,"" I said. Not thinking. Just knowing.
She looked at me. ""You really believe that?""
""Yes.""
""Why?""
""I don't know. But I do.""
We kept walking. Eventually ended up at her apartment building. Stood outside. Still holding hands.
""I don't want this to end,"" she said.
""It doesn't have to.""
""Can I see you again?""
""Tomorrow?""
She smiled. ""Tomorrow.""
But neither of us moved. Couldn't let go.
""This is insane,"" she said.
""I know.""
""I met you six hours ago.""
""I know.""
""But I feel like if I let go of your hand, I'll lose you forever.""
I pulled her closer. ""You won't.""
""How do you know?""
""I don't. But I believe it.""
She looked up at me. We were very close now.
""Can I—"" she started.
I kissed her. Couldn't help it. Just— Had to.
She kissed back.
And— God. It was like— Like remembering. Like something locked deep inside was opening. Like— Home.
We broke apart. Both crying again.
""I know you,"" she whispered.
""I know you too.""
""How?""
""I don't know. But I do.""




That Night - HINA
I didn't sleep. Couldn't. Just lay in bed thinking about him. Ayan. His name. His face. His hand in mine.
It all felt so familiar. But how? I'd never seen him before tonight. Had I?
I grabbed my journal. Flipped through the pages. Years of entries.
""Waiting for someone.""
""Missing someone.""
""Who saved me?""
Stopped at October 23, 2024. The landslide.
""I should be dead.""
""Someone saved me.""
""But I can't remember who.""
I stared at those words. Then grabbed my phone. Searched my own name. Found the article about the landslide. Read it again.
""Nakamura was found alive several meters from the impact site. Cause of displacement unknown.""
Unknown. I'd been moved. Pulled. Someone had pulled me away. But who?
I searched more. Found the original article. The one from October 24, 2024. Before the correction.
""Local Shrine Keeper Dies in Landslide""
I'd been reported dead. Initially. Then found alive. How? Who changed it? Who saved me?
I looked at the date on my phone. September 16, 2029. Five years. Five years since someone saved my life. Someone I couldn't remember.
I thought about Ayan. His face when he saw me. Like he'd been searching. For years.
No. That's impossible. Isn't it?





That Night - AYAN
I couldn't sleep either. Kept thinking about her. Hina. The way her hand felt in mine. The way her name sounded. Familiar.
I got up. Started going through my old research. The mountain. The shrine. October 2024.
Found my search history.
""Hina Nakamura""
I'd searched for her. Before I met her. In October 2026. Two years after her landslide. Why? What had I known?
Clicked through the articles. Found photos. The shrine. The landslide site.
And— A photo of her. From the survivor article. Standing at the shrine. Dark hair. Gentle face. The same face I'd seen tonight.
I'd looked at this photo before. In 2026. Why? What had I been searching for?
I kept digging. Found notes in my old sketchbooks. From October 2026.
""Save her""
""October 23""
""6:42 PM""
""Landslide""
My handwriting. My notes. But I didn't remember writing them.
What had I been planning? What had I done?

Six Months After
AYAN
March. Six months since the mountain.
I still didn't know why I'd gone there. Tried to piece it together. Found the train ticket stub. October 23rd. Found notes in my apartment. Research about atmospheric anomalies. Meteor near-misses. Time distortions.
Found sketches. Hundreds of them. All of the same shrine.
I'd been obsessed with something. But I couldn't remember what.
My coworker said I'd changed after that week. ""You were different before,"" he said. ""Distant, yeah, but also... lighter somehow. Like you had a secret. Now you're just...""
""Just what?""
He shrugged. ""Sad.""
Was I sad? I felt hollow. Like I'd lost something important. But I didn't know what.
I kept drawing the shrine. Couldn't stop. Every evening at 6:42, I'd find myself at my window. Waiting. For what? I didn't know. But I waited anyway.
HINA
March. Six months since the landslide.
Official report said I was lucky. Should have been there when the rocks fell. Somehow wasn't. Somehow survived. But I couldn't remember how.
Grandmother said I'd changed. ""You're quieter,"" she said. ""Before, you were waiting for something. Now you're mourning something.""
""I'm not mourning,"" I said.
""Aren't you?""
Was I? I felt empty. Like I'd lost someone. But who?
I kept the shrine open every evening until 6:42. Didn't know why. Just felt wrong to close earlier. Like I was supposed to be there. Waiting for someone. But no one ever came.



THE FIRST SHIFT RETURNS :-
AYAN
One evening in September. Almost a year since the mountain.
I was at my window at 6:42 like always. Waiting for nothing.
Then—
The light shifted. Just for a second. Just a breath. Colors went strange. Gravity tilted. Sound dulled.
Exactly like— Like something. Something I couldn't remember.
It lasted maybe thirty seconds. Then stopped.
I stood there shaking. That feeling. I'd felt it before. When? Couldn't remember. But it had mattered. God, it had mattered.
I sat down on my floor. Started crying. Still didn't know why. But now I was certain: I'd lost something real. Something impossible. Something important.
HINA
Same evening. September. 6:42 PM.
I was at the shrine like always. Lighting the evening candles.
Then—
The light shifted. Just for a moment. The wind chime rang. Wrong note. Colors changed. Gravity tilted.
Exactly like— Like something I'd forgotten.
It lasted maybe thirty seconds. Then faded.
I stood there. Breathing hard. That feeling. I'd felt it before. Many times before. When? Couldn't remember. But it had been everything.
I looked at the wind chime. Still swaying slightly. Reached up. Touched it. It was warm. Like someone had just been here. Like someone had just left.
I started crying. Because now I knew for certain: Someone had been here. Someone had mattered. And I couldn't remember who.








THE SEARCH BEGINS :-

AYAN
That night, I couldn't sleep. Kept thinking about the shift. That thirty-second moment. It had felt like confirmation. Like someone saying: ""It was real."" Whatever ""it"" was.
I started going through my old research. The meteor. October 2024. The shrine. Found my search history from that week. Names I'd looked up. Places. Articles.
One search stood out: ""Hina Nakamura obituary""
I stared at it. Clicked.
""Local Shrine Keeper Dies in Landslide — October 23, 2024""
But wait. I looked at the date on my computer. September 2027. Checked the article again. October 23, 2024. Three years ago.
She'd died three years ago. So why had I searched for her obituary in October 2026? A year after she died?
Unless—
I clicked another link. Updated article.
""Shrine Keeper Survives Landslide — Official Report Released""
""Hina Nakamura, originally reported dead, was found alive near the shrine. Landslide occurred at 6:42 PM but Nakamura was several meters away from the impact site. Cause of displacement unknown.""
She survived. But I'd searched for her death. Why? What had I known? What had I done?
HINA
I kept a journal after the shift returned. Didn't know why. Just felt important to document.
September 15, 2027
The light changed today. Just for thirty seconds. Like before. Like something I can't remember. I don't know what it means. But I feel less alone.
I started writing every day.
September 20, 2027
I can't shake the feeling I'm waiting for someone. Who? Why can't I remember?
October 1, 2027
Three years since the landslide. I should be dead. I know I should be dead. But I'm not. Why? Who saved me?
I flipped through the pages. Realized I'd been writing the same questions for months. Who? Why? What did I lose?







THE YEARS BETWEEN:-
AYAN
I started traveling. Didn't know why. Just felt like I needed to find something.
Visited shrines across the country. Mountain shrines specifically. Looking for... What?
Kept a notebook. Sketched each shrine. None of them felt right.
My coworker asked what I was doing.
""Searching,"" I said.
""For what?""
""I don't know.""
""Then how will you know when you find it?""
I thought about it. ""I'll just know.""
He thought I was crazy. Maybe I was. But I couldn't stop.
HINA
I left the shrine. First time in my life.
Grandmother supported it. ""You need to find what you're looking for,"" she said.
""I don't know what that is.""
""You will.""
I moved to the city. Felt pulled there. Didn't know why.
Got a job at a small bookstore. Simple work. Quiet. But every evening at 6:42, I'd stop whatever I was doing. Stand still. Wait. For nothing.
My coworkers thought it was odd. I didn't care. It felt necessary.




FIVE YEARS LATER:-
AYAN
Five years since the mountain.
I returned to the city. Hadn't been home in almost two years. Felt like it was time.
Got my old apartment back. Same window. Same view. Same sunset.
Everything was familiar. But I still felt like a stranger. Like I was living someone else's life.
Still drew the shrine sometimes. Still waited at 6:42. Still felt that hollow ache. But quieter now. More bearable. Like I'd learned to live with the absence. Even if I didn't understand it.
HINA
Five years since the landslide.
Still in the city. Still at the bookstore. Still waiting for something I couldn't name. But I'd gotten used to it. The incompleteness. The sense that part of me was missing.
I'd learned to function around it. Made friends. Had routines. Lived.
But that feeling never left. That sense that I was supposed to be somewhere else. With someone else. Doing something else.
But I didn't know what. Or who. Or where. Just that I was here. And they were somewhere. And we were supposed to be together.





SEPTEMBER 15, 2029
(Five years since the brief shift returned)
(Ten years since the blue hour began)
AYAN
Sunday. Normal day. Went for a walk. Needed to clear my head.
Ended up at the train station. Central station. Crowded. Rush hour ending. People everywhere.
I'd just come back from a weekend trip. Another shrine visit. Still searching. Still not finding.
Carrying my bag. Tired. Ready to go home.
Started walking toward the exit. Through the main platform.
6:41 PM. Almost time. Almost—
HINA
Sunday. Normal day. Closing shift at the bookstore. Walking to the train station. Going home.
Crowded platform. People everywhere. I was tired. Long day. Ready to rest.
Started walking toward Platform 3. Through the main concourse.
6:41 PM. One minute until— Until what? I didn't know. But I felt it coming. Something. Someone.
6:42
AYAN
I was walking through the crowd. Dodging people. Checking my phone. Not really paying attention.
Then— 6:42.
There. That feeling. The one I'd been waiting for. For five years. For longer.
Something shifted. Not the light. Not gravity. Not sound. Just— Presence. Like someone was there. Someone important.
I stopped walking. Mid-step. Looked up. Scanned the crowd. Where? Where was it coming from?
HINA
6:42.
There.
I stopped walking. Didn't choose to. Just— Stopped. Like my body knew before my mind did.
Someone was here. Someone important. I could feel it. Like gravity pulling me. Not physically. Emotionally. Toward— Where?
I turned slowly. Scanned the crowd. Hundreds of people. Moving. Talking. Existing. But one of them— One of them was—





THE MEETING:-

AYAN
I saw her.
Twenty meters away. Standing still. In the middle of the moving crowd. Looking around. Looking for something.
Our eyes met.
And— Oh. Oh god.
My chest— I couldn't breathe. Couldn't move. Couldn't think. Just— Her.
It was her. I didn't know how I knew. Didn't know why. But I knew. With absolute certainty. Her.
HINA
I saw him.
Standing in the crowd. Staring at me. Frozen.
And— Oh. My heart— It was pounding. Tears— Why was I crying?
I didn't— I'd never seen him before. Had I?
But— But— I knew him. Somehow I knew him.
(The world continues around them. People passing. Trains departing. Announcements echoing. But they don't hear any of it.)



The Approach:-
AYAN
I started walking. Toward her. Slowly. Like moving through water.
Every step felt impossible. And necessary.
She was walking too. Toward me. Same slow, deliberate steps.
Fifteen meters. Ten.
My hands were shaking. I was crying. Didn't know why. Couldn't stop.
Five meters.
She was crying too. Face wet. Eyes wide. Looking at me. Seeing me.
Three meters.
I stopped. She stopped.
We stood there. In the middle of the station. Strangers. Crying at each other.
HINA
""I—"" I tried to speak. Voice breaking. ""I'm sorry, I don't— I don't know why I'm—""
He shook his head. ""Me neither,"" he said.
His voice. I knew his voice. How did I know his voice?
""Have we—"" I started. Couldn't finish.
""I don't think so,"" he said. But he didn't sound sure. Looked at me like— Like he'd been searching for me. For years.
""This is crazy,"" I said. Laughed through tears.
He laughed too. ""Completely.""
We stood there. Just staring. Just feeling.


The Touch:-
AYAN
My hand moved. Before I could think about it. Reaching toward her.
And she— She reached back.
Our fingers touched.
And— God. Oh god.
It was like— Like coming home. Like finding something I'd lost. Like breathing after drowning. Like— Everything.
I grabbed her hand fully. Held on. She held back. Tight. Like if we let go we'd disappear.
""I'm Ayan,"" I said. Voice shaking. Barely audible.
She was crying harder now.
""Hina,"" she whispered.
Hina. The name hit me like lightning. Hina. I knew that name. I knew it. But from where? When?
HINA
Ayan. His name echoed in my head. Ayan.
I knew it. Somehow I knew it. But I'd never heard it before. Had I?
We were still holding hands. Still crying. Still standing in the middle of the station. People were staring. We didn't care.
""I feel like—"" I started.
""Like you've been looking for me,"" he finished.
""Yes.""
""Me too.""
""How is that possible?""
""I don't know.""
We stood there. Just holding hands. Just being. Together. Finally. Even though we didn't understand why.


Coffee:-
AYAN
""Can I—"" I tried to speak normally. Failed. ""Can I buy you coffee?""
She laughed. Still crying. ""I'd like that,"" she said. ""I'd really like that.""
We started walking. Hand in hand. Through the station. Neither of us let go. Couldn't. Physically couldn't release each other. Like our hands had been waiting for this. For years.
We found a small cafe. Sat across from each other. Still holding hands across the table.
""I don't understand this,"" she said.
""Neither do I.""
""But I feel like—""
""Like this is the most important moment of your life,"" I said.
She stared at me. ""Yes. Exactly yes.""
We sat there. Just existing together. And for the first time in five years— Since that mountain I couldn't remember— I felt whole.



The Sharing:-
HINA
We talked for hours. Closed the cafe. Moved to a park. Sat on a bench. Still holding hands.
Shared everything. Where we lived. What we did. Our families.
But also—
""Do you ever feel like you're missing something?"" I asked.
""Every day,"" he said immediately.
""Me too.""
""Like there's a gap somewhere.""
""Yes. Exactly.""
""Do you wait at 6:42?"" he asked.
I froze. ""How did you know that?""
He shook his head. ""I don't know. I just— I do too. Every day. Stand at my window and wait.""
""For what?""
""I don't know. Do you know what you're waiting for?""
""No. But it feels like someone.""
He squeezed my hand. ""What if it was me?""
""What if it was you?""
""What if we were waiting for each other?""
I looked at him. Really looked at him. ""That's impossible.""
""I know.""
""We've never met before.""
""I know.""
""So why does it feel like I've known you forever?""
He started crying again. ""I don't know. But I feel it too.""



The Walk:-
AYAN
We walked through the city until midnight. Just talking. Just being together.
At one point, we passed a shop window. Saw our reflection. Holding hands.
She squeezed my hand. ""We look like we belong together,"" she said quietly.
""We do,"" I said. Not thinking. Just knowing.
She looked at me. ""You really believe that?""
""Yes.""
""Why?""
""I don't know. But I do.""
We kept walking. Eventually ended up at her apartment building. Stood outside. Still holding hands.
""I don't want this to end,"" she said.
""It doesn't have to.""
""Can I see you again?""
""Tomorrow?""
She smiled. ""Tomorrow.""
But neither of us moved. Couldn't let go.
""This is insane,"" she said.
""I know.""
""I met you six hours ago.""
""I know.""
""But I feel like if I let go of your hand, I'll lose you forever.""
I pulled her closer. ""You won't.""
""How do you know?""
""I don't. But I believe it.""
She looked up at me. We were very close now.
""Can I—"" she started.
I kissed her. Couldn't help it. Just— Had to.
She kissed back.
And— God. It was like— Like remembering. Like something locked deep inside was opening. Like— Home.
We broke apart. Both crying again.
""I know you,"" she whispered.
""I know you too.""
""How?""
""I don't know. But I do.""



That Night - HINA
I didn't sleep. Couldn't. Just lay in bed thinking about him. Ayan. His name. His face. His hand in mine.
It all felt so familiar. But how? I'd never seen him before tonight. Had I?
I grabbed my journal. Flipped through the pages. Years of entries.
""Waiting for someone.""
""Missing someone.""
""Who saved me?""
Stopped at October 23, 2024. The landslide.
""I should be dead.""
""Someone saved me.""
""But I can't remember who.""
I stared at those words. Then grabbed my phone. Searched my own name. Found the article about the landslide. Read it again.
""Nakamura was found alive several meters from the impact site. Cause of displacement unknown.""
Unknown. I'd been moved. Pulled. Someone had pulled me away. But who?
I searched more. Found the original article. The one from October 24, 2024. Before the correction.
""Local Shrine Keeper Dies in Landslide""
I'd been reported dead. Initially. Then found alive. How? Who changed it? Who saved me?
I looked at the date on my phone. September 16, 2029. Five years. Five years since someone saved my life. Someone I couldn't remember.
I thought about Ayan. His face when he saw me. Like he'd been searching. For years.
No. That's impossible. Isn't it?





That Night - AYAN
I couldn't sleep either. Kept thinking about her. Hina. The way her hand felt in mine. The way her name sounded. Familiar.
I got up. Started going through my old research. The mountain. The shrine. October 2024.
Found my search history.
""Hina Nakamura""
I'd searched for her. Before I met her. In October 2026. Two years after her landslide. Why? What had I known?
Clicked through the articles. Found photos. The shrine. The landslide site.
And— A photo of her. From the survivor article. Standing at the shrine. Dark hair. Gentle face. The same face I'd seen tonight.
I'd looked at this photo before. In 2026. Why? What had I been searching for?
I kept digging. Found notes in my old sketchbooks. From October 2026.
""Save her""
""October 23""
""6:42 PM""
""Landslide""
My handwriting. My notes. But I didn't remember writing them.
What had I been planning? What had I done?

A year ago, on new year i set myself a goal.  
The goal almost everyone has had at least once in their life.

Get in shape ⚡️.

I started to look for apps where i can achieve that goal, together with others.  
One where i can push myself and others, to keep going, motivating each other.  
  
Somehow there wasn't one. every app was dedicated to play the game solo. 

So last autumn i started looking into frameworks i can build fast AND really create my own app, without it looking like every other app. I decided for Expo. 

Learnt react native in september.   
Built my first project in November (it was a calendar app 😭)

And in december i decided to really focus and to build this idea. Not for anyone but me.

Fast forward to February 5th 2026:

I wake up, not by an alert, but by app store connect, MY APP GOT APPROVED FOR THE APP STORE😁😁!

I can tell a good from bad tasting coffee, but high-level analysis/nuanced flavor notes are not YET my strong suit. But my palate is getting better, and I want this grinder to be semi\~ end game\~ for my growing tastes. I know there's more aftermarket burrs for the 064s, but that doesn't appeal more or less to me.

By then usually it's afternoon and time to eat again. I push myself to drink fluids. And then I'm at work or at home trying to push myself to get some chores done.

**Memory Transcription Subject : Beau Hunter - Farsul Rescue : Date : Reclaimed Terran Time : May 13th, 2936**

  


Space travel, as it turns out, was quite a terrifying experience. Especially at the exact moment when a ship first hits the atmosphere at a few thousand kilometers per hour. 



Me and Anna were quietly watching the Earth get closer and closer from the forward observation port of the ship, located directly below the ship's bridge. What me and Anna however were not expecting was the window we were looking through to suddenly catch fire before our very eyes.



I quickly became cognizant of how unbelievably high up we were now that there was a ground available for us to crash into, and also how unbelievably deadly the nothingness around us could be if the ship broke open on approach to our home.

 

I swear I nearly soiled my new underwear then and there, as the flighty aliens had to assure both me and Anna that the ship was in fact not on fire, and that this ""atmospheric breaking” was in fact common practice amongst starships returning to a planetary atmosphere.



Afterwards I found myself to finally be experiencing the appropriate level of appreciation for the engineering that had gone into the ship I had spent the last couple of days on. Back in my day the largest thing humanity could put into space was barely larger than a god damn truck, but this behemoth of a ship, the size of a sea based cargo vessel, was currently descending into the earth's atmosphere, and was apparently going to take off again. I asked what kind of rocket fuel this ship ran on, and Aiko merely let out a little giggle.



As the earth grew closer, and I began to recognize the familiar continents from a perspective I would have only otherwise been able to garner from a map or globe, I honed in on where we were heading. We were coming in over the states, or at least what used to be the states, now apparently just referred to as the North American continent.



We looked to be landing somewhere in Arizona or New Mexico as far as I could tell and when asked Aiko just said we were heading to a research town by the name of Flaghill.



After the ship set down on this massive concrete plinth on this massive airfield…spacefield? Our group was scheduled to be some of the last people off the ship. Apparently some complications had come up, and the people at the space port terminal needed some more time to prepare for us. I rubbed at the metal of my collar ponderously as I questioned what exactly their worryingly vague declaration of ‘preparing for us’ could entail.



Daisy eventually got a radio letter from her holopad and we began to make our way out of the ship.



Before we had even made our way to the cargo bay, we were hit by the combined smell of engine oil, something like burnt toast and finally fresh mountain air. Distinct from the pristine hospital like scent of the ship.



As we walked down the massive ramp of the ship onto the landing pad, I really began to take in the scale of some of the ships that we had landed amongst. I stood there mouth agape, as I took in the sight of the multiple building sized behemoths we were surrounded with.



“I can hardly believe these things can even get off the ground!” Anna commented from beside me.



“I can't believe that there's even a ship left after all those flames we flew through on the way down.” I added.



Aiko sidled up next to me. “Yeh they really are quite impressive when you actually take the time to appreciate them.”



Dr.Bilnen from Anna’s side stood up on his hind paws and turned around, pointing out a feature on our own ship that we had missed while checking out the vessels surrounding us. “Check out that spot Aiko” He gestured with a paw. “That's probably what caused that massive jolt during the battle of Talsk.”



Aiko's head turned to see what he was talking about, and she shuttered in response. “Jesus Christ!"" She yelped with a gasp and a shutter. “That's huge.” She spoke in reference to the massive burnt out blast crater pot marking the ship's hull.



“What caused that?” Anna asked. “What jolt?”



“Our vessel was the fleet's command ship.” Dr.Bilnen began to explain. “In reclamation alliance military tactics, all manned vessels are supposed to stay out of combat range when we send in the…. unmanned automated combat space ships to fight, or drones as we call them. The drones are supposed to take all the casualties, but the farsul and kolshian defenders of Talsk must have wanted to take out some revenge on our manned ships. Our command vessel was supposed to be the most protected one in the fleet, but I guess a shot got through, and it really rattled us during the battle.”



“It was really scary,"" Aiko added, her expression going wide-eyed as if she was back in that moment. “The lights went all flickery for a few moments, and everyone in the ship’s bunker started to scream, I think it's the closest I’ve ever been to stampeding.” She added shakily.



“The ship’s hull was thick enough to keep us safe.” Dr.Bilnen spoke, as he reached out to hold Aiko’s hand in comfort.



“It almost wasn’t,” A gruff and low voice suddenly called out from behind us. They were speaking english or human now I guess. I turned to look at who it was, expecting another thawed human, possibly from one of the other ships carrying archives rescues.



Instead what I was greeted by was actually one of the cured humans. This one was an older looking man, dressed in the standard U.E military uniform but covered in a number of pins and medals, hinting at a distinguished career. His stoic aura was helped along by a large scar running down his left cheek, breaking up the greying stubble framing his elongated face.



“The attack drone that hit us was under stealth when it approached, sensors caught it almost too late, if we had been any later to turn into a proper attack angle, it wouldn’t have just pinged off the hull but punched straight through and knocked out life support.”



He pointed a line across the ship's hull to the crater as if to emphasize.



“Damn thing hit us at a bad angle, pinged right off, a few meters to the left and it would have hit the hull flat, and penetrated straight through. Damn lucky we are.” He said with a chuckle, 



“Captain!” Daisy shouted out, standing up straight and saluting the man.



“At ease Exterminator"" He barked in return. Before holding out a hand towards me and Anna, as Daisy relaxed her posture.



“Misses Schoen, Mister…. Hunter ” He spoke my last name with a light chuckle. “Its a pleasure to meet you both and I must say, Hunter? Bit on the nose don’t you think.” Continuing to smirk at me as he shook both me and Anna’s hand.



“It's the name my pappy gave me.” I replied. “Very subtle I know ha ha, Though I can’t really say I’d have ever expected it to ever be such a point of contention though mister?""



“Cutter, Captain Shaun cutter.” He spoke with a quick salute.



“A pleasure to meet you sir.” Anna thanked the man. “I am quite grateful you rescued us, and my friend, even if it was a bit late for her.”



The man removed his captain's hat and placed it to his chest, and bowed in respect towards Anna. “If I could have, I would have stormed the archives myself with just a pressure suit and a service pistol mam, I’m sorry it took us so long.”



“It's… alright.” She replied quietly. “That's how it happened, that's how it is.”



I placed a hand on Anna’s shoulder in a show of solidarity.



“You have my deepest of condolences for what has happened to you both, you especially though Mr.Hunter, I have ten kids between three wives, and I love each and every one of them to death. I would lose it if I lost a single one of them, and I’d mangle anyone who so much as thought to lay a hand on them.



**“**That sounds a bit err… ~~predatory~~ aggressive for a cured human to say.” I replied somewhat curiously.



“Ah that? Well lets just say that at my rank you can get away with a bit of… predatory behavior from time to time."" He spoke cryptically in response before continuing. “I must say though while I have always fought for a better future for my family, I never really thought much about what would happen if I died or disappeared, what kind of effect it might have on the people I love, or at least I didn’t until I got this little beauty.” He said whilst pointing to a metal tube on the front of his neck that seemed to replace his larynx. A scar leading up to it hinting at how he got it.



”Oh wow, that's an interesting prosthetic you have there.” Anna commented curiously. “Your trauma care must be quite advanced to even survive the initial injury long enough to even get it, I take it must also be why your voice is so uncharacteristically deep compared to the rest of the cured humans, yes?” Anna commented.



”Very astute ancestor.” The captain spoke with a grin. “Yeh I actually had an offer to even get a new larynx cloned, but I ended up liking the sound of my new voice. I think it gives me an air of authority."" He spoke with a chuckle. “And I didn't know it at the time, but it brought my voice closer towards the baseline of an original human.”



”How did you get it?” I asked. “If it's not too harsh a memory.” I quickly followed up, not quite sure how far this captain seemed to stray from the cured human baseline I had observed.



”I don’t mind telling, I used to get asked a lot more before I became a captain. Now everyone I meet seems to remember it better than I do ha ha, now let me think for a moment, where to begin…….”

**Memory Transcription Subject : Sergeant Shaun Cutter - United Earth Military : Date : Reclaimed Terran Time : November 7th, 2907 - Fifteen days into the Siege of Wriss.**

  


The screams of bombs, strato drones and my own men rang out across the bombed out  battle field. Accompanied by the rhythmic pulses of hydraulics as the land ship stomped its way through bombed out craters to our objective.



I stood there, coffee mug in hand as the Harchen made land ship crested the lip of a particularly large crater, the sensor officer's eyes lit up in recognition, and he quickly zoomed in the front camera to get a better look at our target.



“Objective in sight sir, defenses still active, multiple batteries and orbital defense cannons present. Multiple hostiles detected manning the walls.” The officer spoke as he tapped on the display showing the heat map of the cattle farm turned fortress, greys manning every square centimeter of its walls.



“About darn time.” I muttered out. I pointed to the comms tech. “Get the XO up here, and hail the rest of the convoy, target sighted, fan out and encircle. Keep the dossur platforms as a rearguard, they will stay put as a fast response element for when something goes wrong.”



“Got it sir” the woman said with a nod. Her determined expression barely lit up by the blue display lights of the cramped command pod.”



XO Berkeley was quick to barge into the command cabin as I finished downing my mug of coffee.



“Status report” I blurted out, slamming the metal mug down on the console, before gesturing to the room.



“Land ships holding together sir.” Engineer Lopez shouted out. “Port hydraulics got a minor leak but weapons and shield grids are all reading as fully operational.""



“And the men?” I shot a sideways glance towards the XO.



“Thirteen criers and only five fainters Sir.”



“Wonderful! We got a brave lot today!”



When the briefing finished the XO ran back out the door and towards the troop bay to get everyone ready to move out for our mission.



As of now, Everything in this region that wasn't a cattle farm or cattle farm adjacent was either now a crater or a pre-crater, all in the service of an established strategy for getting as many cattle farm victims off world whilst having to deal with as few arxur ground forces as possible. However, as our campaign had taken us further and further into the heart of arxur space, the greys very reasonably on their part, adjusted their defense strategy in accordance with our tactics.



They had begun fortifying the hell out of their cattle farms, using their farms stock as sapient shields. Some bases in the past had even tried to use the lives within as hostages to secure their escape, let them go or they would kill all their stock they would threaten, not that we'd ever negotiate, they would eat them anyways, if not them then someone else later. The play now as a result, was to go in hard and fast before they could act on any of those threats.



I leaned forward, grabbing onto a handle bar as I watched over the pilots shoulder as our land ship approached the cattle farm. Streams of plasma flew both ways as we trudged closer and closer.



I found myself almost mesmerized by the glittering pulses of incoming plasma shot, as they flickered harmlessly against our shields, the arxur lacked the logistical capacity this late into the war to field any ground based artillery capable of harming our walkers shields, The only threat to this hunk that we really had left to worry about was….



***BOOM***



***BANG***



***SNAP***



A sickening metallic groan roared out throughout the land ship's superstructure.



Mines.



“Status!”



”Left forward leg is down and dragging, conditions too muddy for combat speed!”



“Set us down and call in a mine sweeping team” I loudly ordered. ”Keep firing on the farm’s defenses, the second their perimeter defenses are down, we will disembark and follow in the dossur weapons platforms on foot.”



But before the crew could even respond to my new orders the ship’s status lights began flashing red.



“Explosive detected on the hull”



*Shit.*



“Prepare for borders!”



***Bang***



The intruder alarms went off instantly as yet another explosive rocked the hull. I looked over to the security feeds as the display flashed white. The arxur had thrown in a room clearing explosive and were charging in after it. I didn't hesitate. I had barged through and locked the command pod doors before anyone could question me. Locking everyone the operation would need to continue inside.



I moved to help cover the breach point, custom plasma pistol in hand. What men had survived had already repelled the initial wave of borders, the arxur, panicked and clearly unprepared for their own success, failed to capitalize on their surprise attack. I arrived just as my men gunned down two arxur who had foolishly peaked out from the side of the hull breach, clearly intending to hold position until their second wave was ready.



We waited for a long minute, as the arxur no doubt assembled outside. Before a loud growl roared out.



“CHARGE!!!!”



The air filled with the sound of plasma and kinetic fire again, as the attack began again in earnest. I didn't fire though, not immediately, they always sent the dregs in first, I simply turned my head, closed one eye and lined up my sights on the door. I didn't need to wait long for my intended target to arrive.



A larger, much more well fed elite unit poked its scaly snout through the breach point, eyes focused, weapon ready.



There you are… -***BANG***\- the sound of my overtuned plasma pistol rang out across the ship, taking the greys head clean off its body.



The crew continued to fire.



The private in front of me’s mag went dry while the bodies of our opponents were beginning to pile up, serving as cover for the next wave of arxur, I grabbed him by the shoulder and pulled him back, “fall back to the next bulkhead!” I yelled whilst lining up another arxur. -***Bang***\- then another -***Bang***\-, I grabbed a stumbling lieutenant, “Keep going!” I roared, covering my men's retreat. -***Bang***\-***Bang***\-***Bang***\- three shots, each trigger pull well aimed, and placed right at the base of the neck, it was a far more reliable target than the head, it swayed less as they moved.



I slowly backed up to the new firing line, taking my time, as I saw no reason to rush, these arxur had one way in, they were clearly panicked and rushing in blindly, poorly prepared for step two of their plans, the second wave was thinning out and I needed to keep composed as an example to my men.



I lined up the last big one and took my time, he was just another grey rushing in madly, 3…2…1… 



***BOOM***



***BANG***



“SHIT!”.



The hull was rocked by another explosion, compromising my footing and causing my shot to go wide, and the arxur was on top of me in seconds.



I leaped back and balled up, abandoning any semblance of offense and trusting in my men, the grey first slashed at my arms, but the smart fabric in my sleeves stopped any kind of penetration, but it still hurt like hell, he slashed at my head, and managed to claw up my face.



The world went red.



Another slash, and I felt a warm wetness across my throat. All the while.

 

\-***Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang***\-



My crew had unleashed a rainstorm of plasma shots upon the enraged arxur, striking it what must have been at least a dozen times, before its battered form finally collapsed onto me, dead.



“Medic!” I heard a distant voice call out.



I heard shuffling around me, through the crimson and darkness. 



I struggled to breathe, but the massive grey’s weight was too much, and when they finally got it off of me, I quickly discovered a new problem. I had sat up on reflex , gasping desperately for air, only to be met by blood finding its way quickly into my lungs, causing me to fruitlessly cough and hack in panic.



Wasting no time the combat medics shoved me to the ground. In my instinctive panic I shoved them right off, but luckily the crew was there to help hold me down through my flailing.



I couldn't make out what they were saying, my panicking mind wasn’t concerned with such things, merely the overbearing need to get oxygen into my lungs instead of blood.



They started shoving something into my throat. I felt cold air being forced down where it shouldn’t.



My heart was pounding so hard in my chest it felt almost deafening.



I was vaguely aware of my men charging past me, propping up their weapons on the arxur corpses between me, the medics and the breach point.



The medic grabbed my snout, turning my head and shining a light in my eye. “It's okay sergeant we got you! Just keep trying to breathe alright, don't give up!.”



Okay. Is what I wanted to say, but I couldn't form the words If I’d wanted to.



And I would never do so the same way ever again.

**Memory Transcription Subject : Beau Hunter -  Farsul Rescue : Date : Reclaimed Terran Time : May 13th, 2936**



“I was laid up for the rest of the ground operations after that, that arxur cut went deep, doctors told me any deeper and I might have died from the spinal injury.” The captain spoke, whilst rubbing at his metal throat.



“I had a lot of time to think then, I sat on the deck of that land ship for an hour, and in the bed of a medical frigate for days. I missed out on the rest of the ground fighting, but I couldn't help but think of anything other than my family and kids, about what would have happened had my crew not been so quick to react, or those dossur reinforcements hadn't arrived so quickly afterwards. I wasn't worried about losing my own life but... How it would affect those I cared about, the thought of depriving them of a father, of making them sad at my loss, it hurt me, and those thoughts stayed in the back of my mind for the rest of the war.” He finished off solemnly.



“Cherish every moment you have with them.” I spoke wearily. ”You never know when it could be your last chance.”



The captain simply nodded in reply, pulling out a metal tube from his hat, and placing it to his lips and letting off a puff of smoke.



*Some kind of space cigarette?*



*“How did you dodge a screening?” Daisy asked, ""After all you did in the war?” She clarified.*



“Like I said, rank has its privileges” he smiled before turning his hat on his head and looking at me intently with one eye, before shaking his head.



“Listen son.” he started speaking again in between puffs. “I’m not one of those R.A folks, I’m not going to sit here and blow smoke up your ass with pleasantries and prettied up speeches. I know you're both going through your own kind of hell right now. You didn't ask for any of this, and you no doubt will have a lot on your plate to deal with going forward. But it needs to be said, humanity needs you.”



“What do you mean?” I asked.



“You’ve no doubt seen how the ship's crew has reacted to you all, while yes plenty have been curious, others excited even to meet you, plenty have been afraid, depressed, and even worried. Concerned that they might have some latent predator influence buried deep inside them, that they might explode at any moment and hurt those they care about.”



“That's ridiculous!” Anna proclaimed. 



“I know, but that's the truth!” The captain shot back.“ And that's just been the response of my crew alone, a crew mind you, that knew about the predator reveal long before anyone else, most of the planet right now doesn't know about even half the stuff they did, hell most of the R.A citizenry doesn't know, there are suspicions and no shortage of evidence floating around, but most people for now are happy to just write it off and dismiss such things as simple rumors spread across holonet message boards and conspiratorial blog posts. The average person just knows for certain that the Federation altered our histories, and not much more.”



“What are you getting at?” I asked.



“Billions of people across the galaxy, not even just humans, are soon going to learn that their predators, and billions more are going to learn that their herdmates and neighbors are predators as well. There is going to be chaos, stampedes, and no doubt plenty of people who might not be able to live with the news.” He spoke solemnly as he took another long puff from his cigarette.



“We can't afford to not tell them, however. Things can't carry on like they are, people deserve to know, and we need allies if we are going to end this war, or at least, people who won’t back the kolshians. And for all of this we need your help, a lot more than you need ours.”



“What do you even need from us?”



“We need you to be yourselves, to show the galaxy predators are people too, and that they're not monsters for being descended from one. I've met monsters ancestor, I’ve looked them dead in the eyes, and plenty of those eyes were located on the sides of their heads.”



He casually placed his cigarette back into the folds of his captain's hat.



“I know that may seem like a lot to put on you right now, but that’s the situation, and those are the stakes.”



“Is that it?” Anna chuckled nervously. “That doesn't sound too bad.”



“Yeh no pressure at all.” I said in a tentative joking voice.



“No big deal at all,” the captain said with a smile. ”Just be yourselves, and put up with the press for a while, that's all I ask, leave the rest up to the politicians. And while I'm sure from what you’ve heard about this planet, that it might not feel like yours anymore. I sincerely hope you can make a home here in time.""



The captain began to talk about what he expected from our stay in the research town based on what he has heard so far, but was cut off by some frantic shouting from across the pad.



“Captain Cutter, Captain Cutter!“ I heard a pair of frantic exterminators shout in unison. ""We need your help with…. “ Only for them to freeze, as the speakers stopped the second they got our group's attention. I'm not sure if it was me or Anna, or the captain’s gaze that got the exterminators to freeze up, as the pairs panicked gazes couldn't seem to settle on what threat they wanted to focus on more, as they glanced between me, Anna and the captain, but one of them managed to get his shit together when the captain snapped at them. “Spit it out officers!” He snapped, ""What is it you need help with?”



“Uh.. uh… sorry sir, we are stationed aboard the *Hope of the Herd*, and we have just tried to wake up one of the human ancestors on board our ship using the notes and recordings we got from your ship, b..but when we woke them up they almost immediately flew into a rampage sir, and we cant get them to calm down! We even deployed the bloodlust countermeasures to try and calm them, but it did nothing but make them even angrier! We were hoping your crew could help us sir.”



Aiko perked up at this, Daisy tensed up, and a contemplative expression crossed Dr.Bilnen’s face. As the new officers regarded our little group.



“Well officers,” The captain said slyly, “I’d say it's fortunate that we have the planet's foremost experts on ancient human thawing standing right here with us!”



\------------Lore Time!-----------

I usually don't do this, but I couldn't fit these fun little lore tidbits into the battle of Wriss flashback, so I thought I'd include them here.



You might be wondering what got into the fed species heads to give them the courage to storm the battlefields of Wriss to rescue their captured herd members. And that's an easy question to answer.



Success.



As drone warfare units transformed the reality of space combat for the federation militaries. Eventually came the realization that the arxur could be beaten, and with the capturing of the space above a number of arxur cattle colonies, the desire and confidence eventually came about to fight them on what was historically their own turf, to take the fight to the arxur on the ground.



The federation strategy was three fold.



Step one: secure planetary orbit, and achieve uncontested orbital supremacy.



Step two: bomb everything that isn't a cattle farm or holding facility to smithereens, with a combination of conventional and antimatter bombardment.



Step three: Send in the ground forces.



It should be noted that the federation military at the time and the Reclamation Alliance forces after it, essentially wage war in the most cowardly way possible, whilst accidentally channeling both the clone wars and warhammer universe in aesthetic.



The harchen designed land ships, which the captain is riding in this chapter, were essentially built with the ethos that while fed forces were decent at ship combat with the greys, they struggled at ground warfare, so naturally you must simply build a space ship but put it on the ground, problem solved!



Not mentioned here but the feds also employed a number of krakotl designed aerial combat drones, built after the initial success of their space born counterparts, these were designed to fight arxur forces on the ground, and only occasionally misidentified the walking harchen land ships as enemy arxur.



One vehicle that seldom got to participate in the battle of Wriss was the Gojid spikeback, an armored truck design, covered in ablative spike armor to prevent arxur mobbing of the vehicle, while absorbing plasma shot and rocket hits.



The reason for their lack of inclusion was that the area surrounding the cattle farm they were trying to raid was not only too fortified for the unshielded trucks to approach, but also too covered in craters for the wheeled vehicles to safely navigate without getting stuck.



Last but not least for now, we have the Dossur combat platforms. The Dossur in general in the war were surprise MVPs. Turns out when the little guys get over the “Ahh predator” thing, they are actually quite brave and composed, and make for excellent squad commanders for mix species units. The Arxur’s immense size never really bothered them, because they were always smaller than everyone else by default.



And the Dossur certainly weren't afraid when riding in their combat platforms. Heavily up armored and up gunned dossur walking platforms. These six crewed little dossur mechs, had guns facing in every direction, and were designed for maximum crew survivability like all federation armored units. Their ease of production and flexible use cases made them a staple on every ground battle or station raid during the final stages of the federation push into arxur space.



In summary, Federation vs Arxur ground warfare was always a messy and chaotic affair, as they tried to leverage personal safety and the emotional security of their men, against the ferocity of their foe and the need to push forward despite their fears. Battles were won or lost at the hands of those commanders who might in any other circumstance be labeled as diseased.(In fact many were after the war) In large part due to the fact that the feds had no real ground doctrine before this besides burn it with fire and run away. It was up to the brave few to learn on the fly and push their herd mates through to the finish line.
