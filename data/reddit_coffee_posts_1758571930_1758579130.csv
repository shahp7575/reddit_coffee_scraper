1nnzyac,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nnzyac/the_great_leftover_labeling_scandal/,The Great Leftover Labeling Scandal,"I swear, I was about to lose it. My perfectly prepped pesto pasta, clearly labeled with my name and the date, had vanished from the fridge. Vanished. This wasn't the first time, but it felt highkey personal now. I stared at the empty container, then at the passive-aggressive note Chloe had left on Liam’s beer bottles about ""respecting shared space."" Yeah, Chloe was right, but this was *my* pasta.

We’d been living in this urban apartment for like, six months, and honestly, it was usually chill. Me, Chloe the organized queen, Liam the perpetually laid-back chef (who rarely cleaned up after himself), and Sam, our resident social butterfly. Our main shared living hurdles always seemed to revolve around the kitchen.

The chore chart was a suggestion, not a mandate, apparently. Liam would cook up a storm – seriously, his tacos were legendary – but then the pans would ""soak"" for days. Chloe would get visibly stressed, and I’d lowkey just do them sometimes to avoid the tension. But the food? That was sacred.

I paced the living room, fuming. Sam walked in, scrolling on his phone. ""Yo, what's up, Maya? You look like you just saw a ghost.""

""Worse,"" I grumbled, pointing dramatically at the offending empty container. ""My pesto pasta. Gone. Who does that?""

Sam peered into the fridge. ""Oh, my bad, was that yours? I thought Liam made a big batch for everyone last night. He was cooking a lot.""

My jaw dropped. ""Liam? He didn't cook last night! That was *my* meal prep!"" I felt the heat rising. ""This is literally the third time someone's eaten my food without asking. We need to talk about this, for real.""

That night, after Liam got home, I brought it up. Gently, but firmly. Chloe, bless her organized heart, pulled out a whiteboard. ""Okay, so clearly the 'unspoken rules' aren't working. We need a system. Not just for chores, but for shared food and individual food.""

Liam looked genuinely contrite about the pasta. ""Dude, I'm so sorry, Maya. I honestly thought it was communal."" Sam chimed in, ""Yeah, me too. My bad.""

We ended up creating two sections in the fridge: one for ""Shared/Communal"" items and one for ""Individual/Labeled."" We even decided on a system for shared groceries – a shared list on a whiteboard and a Venmo pot for common staples like milk, coffee, and (finally!) toilet paper. Chloe was on fire, listing out proposed chore rotations for dishes, counters, and general tidying. Liam even volunteered to be the ""deep clean"" person once a month if someone else handled his regular dish duty. It was a compromise, but it felt so valid.

It wasn’t perfect overnight, no cap. There were still moments where a rogue pan might linger, or someone forgot to update the shared list. But the air felt lighter. We had an actual system, and more importantly, we talked it out. It wasn't about the pasta, honestly. It was about respect and communication. That night, Liam actually cooked for all of us – a peace offering of epic proportions – and we all sat around the table, laughing, our individual and shared tupperware containers neatly stacked in their designated spots. We were still figuring things out, but we were doing it together.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

I watched the river of people — jerseys, jostle, jeers,
neon like a nervous heartbeat over concrete cheers.
College comets crowding sidewalks, shouting at a scoreboard sky,
all of them trying on futures like new shoes — then asking why.

It ain’t the heels you bought to stand taller tonight,
it ain’t the jersey you flash like armor under lights,
it ain’t the grade you framed or the ring you show,
it ain’t the like, the line, the ledger — it’s all for show.

They trade truth for tags, for show.
They trade time for trends, for show.
They trade touch for applause, for show.
They trade longing for a label, for show.

Student with a coffee stain, parent with a quiet plan,
hustler in a hoodie, preacher with a palm —
every story looking for a stamp, every life trying on a brand,
nobody asking the window why it’s glass, nobody lifting hands.

You measure to be measured — measured to be more,
you build a loud small life with a soft, secret core.
You chase a moment that will leave you chasing still;
you count the wins, forget the wind that bends the will.

Not the shoes, not the scores, not the photo-perfect pose —
not the wins you post, not the friends you chose.
It’s the whispered work behind the curtain that hums,
truth ain’t loud, baby — truth hums.

So look up from the screen, from the script, from the show:
the skyline’s not impressed by what you pretend to know.
We’re all a little foolish, and that’s the honest part —
I wink at the madness and it winks back to my heart.

It ain’t the heels, it ain’t the jersey, it ain’t the score —
it’s the life you keep quiet, the life that wants more.",1,1758577515.0,DeepThoughts,0,1.0,False

1nnzjma,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nnzjma/aita_for_ending_a_friendship/,"AITA for ending a ""friendship""?","Me (34F) and this guy (31M) met 10 years ago in college. We shared a group of friends, he always liked me but we never actually engaged one-on-one. He'd follow me online during all this time. Eventually he got married, had a child, and I moved to another city. 

In 2022 we reconnected online. He was in an open marriage at the time, and wanted to meet for drinks/sex, we flirted daily but I did not meet him because I lived far away and it was not feasible to travel just to see him. In 2023, due to work, I moved to the city he lived in and we had a date. Nothing serious, just talking at my place and had a few laughs. He ghosted me afterwards and I was a bit bummed, but didn't care much. We shared some friends in common, and I've heard from his friends that he actually closed off his marriage and did not have guts to tell me, but wanted to apologize.

Somehow, we ended up working together on a project and he apologized for his behavior. He said he really liked me and asked if we could be friends. He really pushed for it. I did not have strong feelings against him, so I forgave him and we'd meet for coffee almost weekly and we became really close friends. Couple months later, he forgot my birthday, despite the fact that I told him about it two days before, and that I wanted to celebrate with my friends.  We had an argument over it, and he stopped talking to me. I shrugged it off and moved on with my life. 

2025, guess who comes back? He says he misses me, and wants to reconnect. I give him yet another chance. His marriage is open again. He finally talks about his feelings, that he did not want to ruin our friendship back in the day but he feels something for me. We finally have sex and it's good. We keep having sex for two months, and meeting weekly to talk, watch movies. 

Abruptly he got divorced (it was not for me, but for other reasons) and then everything changed.  I didn't push him for a romantic relationship because I knew he wasn't ready, and I offered my support and friendship to him during the divorce. He invited me to a trip overseas, saying that now that he was single, he wanted to enjoy life and do things he never did before (i.e. traveling with someone he liked overseas). I accepted it and we made plans, he bought the plane tickets, etc. 

Then, he started being a jerk. 

One day, he invited me for a game night, said he'd drop his kid by his ex and come to my place. Around 8PM he told me he couldn't make it because his ex wouldn't be able to spend the night with his kid.  I found out he did in fact dropped his kid by his ex and lied to me about it. I was very upset and confronted him on the lie. He apologized profusely, said he was just tired and did't have the nerve to cancel our plans. I wanted to stop our ""friendship"" right there, but he asked for another chance. I rationalized he was still messed up due to the divorce, so I gave him. 

After this incident, I couldn't trust him anymore and stopped having sex. He tried to be more present, would text every day, we'd meet every week for drinks/board games at my place, but no sex was involved. He even said once that he didn't know exactly what he was looking for in our relationship, because hanging out with me was ""random"" and sometimes there was sex, sometimes there was not. I let this comment slide and tried to believe it was just the musings of a confused man and not a complaint. 

Last month,  he invited me to his parents' house (where he's living with his kid) so we could talk and drink some wine. We were having a great time and suddenly his daughter woke up and he panicked. He asked me to hide in the bedroom, and then to leave because his daughter wouldn't sleep and she couldn't see me there. I was perplexed by his reaction, because we were literally just talking and drinking wine. He apologized but said his daughter would tell his ex/his parents that he had ""a woman"" in the house and that could not happen. I felt humiliated and left. He blowed up my phone afterwards apologizing and hoping I'd understand. 

I couldn't deal with all of this bs anymore, and after a few days of arguments and apologies, I decided to end our ""friendship"". He was very dramatic, said I was his only friend, that he admired me and liked me too much. That he was sleeping around with other girls, but they did not matter at all to him, they were just ""meaningless flings"", and I was his only friend and the only one he trusted. Tried to rewrite history saying he stopped having sex with me and pushed for a friendship because he's not ready for a romantic relationship with anyone after the divorce, but as a friend he can come through, and that he wants to come through for me. That he did not want to lose me yada yada.

I was BAFFLED by this guy ""friend zoning"" me when I did not ask for any relationship whatsoever (we did not even had the ""what are we"" talk), when he spent months having sex with me, when he invited me to a trip overseas, when he'd drop by my place every week and talk to me every single day. I lost it and told him that what he called friendship was emotional parasitism, that he was a terrible person and I regret giving him so many chances, gave back his stuff, and that he could go on the trip alone. 

 He had bought the plane tickets, I told him I'd pay for mine. He refused, said ""screw the money, I don't give a fuck"". I told him not to contact me anymore  and we unfollowed each other on social media. Now he's telling our mutual friends that I'm a bitch, immature, and that I broke his heart.

I began smoking more than a year ago, I'm entering my second year of chain smoking, and I am frustrated.

What appeals to me about smoking cigarettes is this habitual routine of it. Because I usually do it the first thing in the morning after I get up. The consistency of the first thing in the morning at the exact same time every day doing the same ritual. Going outside and getting some fresh air, and then polluting that fresh air with chemicals. 

Another thing which appeals to me about smoking is the fidgeting. Just something to fidget with repeatedly over and over again. I used to have a big problem with biting my nails, and the large reason why I stopped was because of smoking. Smoking to me is similar to a fidget spinner.

I want to write on this subreddit progressive updates on how am I feeling, and pour my thoughts about my urges to smoke, because I keep trying to quit and yet. Am I allowed to do this, or is that spamming?

A huge reason why I keep relapsing is largely because I forget how disgusting it is. Sometimes when I smoke, its so dirty, disgusting, that I begin to gag. I smell the toxicity of what I'm doing, literally. I pause for a brief moment to ask why am I doing this. I look at the cigarette, and... BLEH.

But then I stop for a bit, and I forget about that feeling of disgust. I forget about that grossness and I begin to think about the smooth taste and farm feeling of a cigarette smoking, thinking of ways I can relax. with it. Sitting outside with a coffee and enjoying a cigarette, feeling the nicotine buzz, and so on.

I couldn't find them and figured my mum had put them away somewhere over the summer since they're winter boots. But when I got home and asked her, she told me she'd thrown them away because one shoe had a hole near the sole. I got upset because she never told me about this when she did it, and she also never asked permission to throw away these shoes I bought with my own money. I don't have a job and I'd understand if she still felt like my possessions are somewhat hers if I buy them with the allowance I get from her and my dad, but I'd bought these with my own birthday money so I was upset she never thought to get my approval before throwing away my belongings. She couldn't seem to understand why I was actually upset and just kept repeating that she threw them away because they had a hole, laughing at how she thought the only reason I was mad was because of her actually throwing them away. Later that day we had an unrelated argument, I was still mad she didn't seem to understand why I was upset, and after I apologised to her about our argument, she apologised for throwing my shoes out, again she didn't apologise for the actual reason I was upset, just the reason she thought I was. Not wanting to argue anymore I let it be.

  
Today, my brother bought up me being mad about the shoes again in a joking manner. He wasn't there for the initial argument and he goes out with my mum for coffee most days, so I'm guessing at some point she brought up the argument to him and was complaining about me to him (just speculation but it wouldn't be the first time she complains about me to my brother). I got upset that she was laughing about it because she still didn't understand why I was upset, she then instantly snapped at me and told me to just drop it because she already apologised and that she thought the whole situation was just funny and I was dragging it out. I wanted to bring up the fact that she still didn't understand that I wasn't mad at the actual act of her throwing out my shoes, but at the principle that she doesn't respect my personal belongings and it also felt that she doesn't respect me because she never thought to come to me about the situation initially, but I knew that if I brought it up after she asked me to drop it she would just blow up on me and I didn't want that.

  
I feel sort of stuck because I don't know if I'm just blowing the whole situation up because me and my mum have a pretty tense relationship, or if I'm rational for being angry at her for what she did. I just want a bit of outside perspective on this thanks!",1,1758577271.0,AmItheAsshole,6,1.0,False

I’m looking for opinions on where my husband & I might like to settle. We’re both currently in grad school in Ames, Iowa. We actually LOVE Ames, but Iowa is not for forever for us. 

We definitely have a preference to the Midwest (especially Minnesota or Wisconsin), but would maaaaybe consider Colorado, the PNW, or the Northeast. I’ve lived in the South forever so I’m not really wanting to go back. Anywhere with crazy heat is a no. 

Here’s what we love about Ames: 
- SO community-oriented with lots of free events. Everyone is kind, we are close with our neighbors
- Very walkable
- Our downtown strip has everything we could possibly need. It’s like Stars Hollow in Gilmore Girls. Very cozy, small town vibes. It is basically 100% small local businesses, and includes a local co-op grocer, fabric store, knitting store, a photo printing & film processing shop, stationary store, hair studio, nail studio, coffee shops, record store, tattoo shops, herbal tea and apothecary store, local bookstore, candle shop, restaurants, an outdoorsy gift shop… and the perfect farmers market on Saturdays. Literally everything we could need is packed into a 4-block downtown, walking distance from our house. Love it. 
- Very progressive blue dot and very environmentally-conscious town


As for where we will move… 

MUST HAVES: 
- progressive blue town (even if in a red state)
- Great farmers markets 
- kind people, community-oriented, good place to raise kids 
- emphasis on small/local businesses 
- close proximity to national forests, national wildlife refuges, or national parks (due to our careers)
- does not get nearly as hot as the South in summer, and all 4 seasons is essential 
- if it’s less than 100k population, has a larger city within 1 hr drive 

WOULD LIKE, but not a deal breaker:
- blue state 
- Near water. Particularly interested in the Great Lakes, obviously open to oceans too
- college town, we like the energetic vibes and how there’s always things to do 
- has neighborhoods of historic homes 
- 70k-250k population

We loved living in Tallahassee FL (another college town) but it was way too hot. Loved living in Omaha, NE too but too much concrete and corn fields; not enough green space. 

We loved traveling to Minneapolis, Portland, Seattle, Spokane, St Louis, Kansas City. Unfortunately the first 3 are too big of cities for us, but we’d be open to specific towns or neighborhoods on the outskirts of a big city. 

We are particularly interested in Madison WI, Duluth MN, Milwaukee WI, Bend Oregon, Eugene Oregon, or somewhere in Michigan, but we haven’t traveled to these places yet… if anyone has reviews on these places!

1nnzcm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/aboutyoursepticsystem/comments/1nnzcm6/qa_most_commonly_asked_questions_and_answers/,Q&A most commonly asked questions and answers about your septic system,"Most Commonly Asked Questions About Septic Systems (With Answers)

1. What is a septic system, and how does it work?

A septic system is an on-site wastewater treatment system commonly used in rural or unsewered areas.

 It consists of two main parts:

 a septic tank and a drainfield (also called a leach field).

How it works: Wastewater from the home flows into the septic tank, where solids settle to the bottom (forming sludge) and oils rise to the top (forming scum). The clarified liquid (effluent) then flows into the drainfield, where it is naturally filtered and treated by the soil.

2. How often should a septic tank be pumped?

Most septic tanks should be pumped every 3 to 5 years, depending on the tank size, household size, and water usage habits.Neglecting this can lead to system failure, backups, or expensive repairs.

3. What should not go into a septic system?

To protect the system and extend its life, avoid flushing or draining the following: Grease, oils, and fatsWipes (even those labeled “flushable”)Coffee grounds, feminine hygiene products, dental flossHarsh chemicals, paints, or medicationsExcessive water from hot tubs or laundryThese can clog pipes, kill beneficial bacteria, or cause the system to fail prematurely.

4. How can I tell if my septic system is failing?

Common signs of a failing septic system include:  Slow drains or gurgling pipesSewage backups into the homeFoul odors around the tank or drainfieldStanding water or unusually green, lush grass over the drainfieldPrompt attention is crucial—failure can contaminate groundwater and require costly remediation.

5. Can I build or plant over my septic system?

No structures (such as decks, sheds, or driveways) should be built over the septic tank or drainfield.Planting shallow-rooted grasses is fine, but avoid trees and shrubs, as roots can infiltrate and damage the system.

6. How long does a septic system last?

With proper maintenance, a septic system can last 20 to 40 years or longer.The lifespan depends on materials, soil conditions, usage, and maintenance practices.

7. Is regular septic system inspection necessary?

Yes. It’s recommended to have the system professionally inspected every 1 to 3 years. Inspections can detect early warning signs and help schedule pumping before problems arise.

8. Can heavy rain affect my septic system?

Yes. Heavy rainfall or flooding can saturate the drainfield, impeding the soil’s ability to absorb and treat effluent. During such times, limit water usage and avoid doing laundry or taking long showers.

9. Do septic additives help?

Most experts agree that septic tank additives are unnecessary and often ineffective.A well-functioning septic tank contains all the natural bacteria it needs. In some cases, additives can even harm the system.

10. How can I protect my septic system?

Pump regularly. Conserve water.Avoid flushing harmful substances. Keep the drainfield clear. Schedule periodic inspections. A proactive approach is the key to ensuring your system operates efficiently for decades.",1,1758576963.0,aboutyoursepticsystem,0,1.0,False

1nnz5wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Puerh/comments/1nnz5wk/home_drystorage_advice_for_high_quality_puerh/,Home Dry-Storage Advice for High Quality Puerh?,"My goal in posting this is to seek some better direction from more experienced people to hopefully narrow down my storage experiments. Lots of people online are quick to give advice that worked for them with zero consideration into the other’s goals and all the variables that affect end results. For example, I’m not as concerned with long term storage since I like young/semi-aged raw puerh. Regarding wet vs dry storage, I vastly prefer dry-storage raw puerh thanks to its preservation of high-notes/huigan. I also have terrible home conditions for puerh, leading me to eventually invest in a humidor. I’ll try to be brief and give a quick overview of my journey that led me to post this:

I’ve read people suggest that pumadors are excessive and that puerh is resilient, but these people clearly don’t live in my bone-dry centrally-heated city apartment. People have suggested that a food-grade (unscented) plastic storage box and some boveda is enough for a pumador, but these people clearly don’t live with the wild temp fluctuations I deal with that screw with true humidity. To combat this others suggest an unplugged mini-fridge to shave off temp highs/lows, but these people clearly don’t live with the ungodly heat waves where my built-in apartment AC decides its too hot to work and gives itself a vacation, leaving my poor puerh baking in 85F/30C+ indoor temperatures on *average* (highs went 90F+). Concerns about airflow led me to A-B tested some Mylar+Boveda vs Mylar+Boveda+coffee straw(for minimal but non-zero airflow) and determined that after a few weeks, the coffee-straw trick results in better tea. Concerns about ideal humidity lead me to A-B test mylar+boveda+straw at different RH%; I believe 69% is ideal but idk if that’s because it revived drier tea or if it’d degrade high-notes overtime because supposedly excess humidity is partially responsible for that.  

More so, I also want to point out that I’m most concerned about **higher quality puerh** here. I’m fairly confident that those heatwave temperature peaks had a drastic negative effect because my nicer cakes in particular used to have some wicked Huigan, but now it’s just “good” tea but not “Great!”. They have yet to recovered (if ever). While temp fluctuations could be responsible as well, I know it’s at least partially related to temp-highs itself because I tragically had an unintentional comparison group with some higher quality black teas in an air tight container (not pumador) that also degraded quite substantially before/after the heat wave. My lower quality “daily drinkers” weren’t *as* affected, presumably because they didn’t have as many “volatile compounds” or whatever it is that’d get jacked up in such heat. So I’m not just looking for advice based on how someone’s $0.15/gram puerh still tastes “fine” with only mylar+boveda, but rather in the context of **preserving flavor/high-notes/huigan of higher-end puerh** over years.

This all resulted in me biting the bullet and just investing in a proper (cigar) humidor. Its temperature controlled (no temp highs or fluctuations to kill volatile compounds), warmer than a wine cooler (wine coolers supposedly being too cold for puerh) has some minimal but non-zero airflow (desirable after my A-B testing with mylar+coffee straw), removable cedar draws (good for cigars but I’ll be using it for puerh so out they go), and crossing fingers the overall low maintenance and piece of mind will be worth the cost. 

This is where I’m now asking for actual advice. **To those who both value the bright notes that dry-stored young/semi-aged sheng puerh has to offer, have ventured into the higher-end of puerh that has that potent Huigan, and successfully preserved both of those in these higher-end cakes over years,** whats the ideal temp/RH% for that specific end-goal? Whats your airflow situation? Again, I’ve already went down the rabbit hole and its easy to get a million opinions on something being better/worse with zero context to what the goal even is, so that’s why I figured a post would be my best bet. Based on past experiences, I’m thinking 70F temperature with 69%RH boveda would be best? Moreso, in the name of experimenting, I plan to to buy a newer decent-quality cake, and spitting it in chunks:

A few in Mylar + coffee straw (to simulate a mostly-enclosed tong) in the Humidor 70F/65%RH:

* One with mylar+72%RH Boveda+straw
* One with mylar+69%RH Boveda+straw
* One with mylar+65%RH Boveda+straw
* One with mylar+62%RH Boveda+straw 
* One smaller chunk in paper-wrapper, no mylar (perhaps too much airflow, but I'll see) 

One sacrificial smaller set in storage box with all its tragic temperature swings/highs/lows (especially with winter coming up my home will be colder.

* One with mylar+straw+boveda 72%RH
* One with mylar+straw+boveda 69%RH
* One with mylar+straw+boveda 62%RH
* Not even going to bother leaving one out of mylar because I know it'll be ruined

Any other advice/suggestions regarding this experiment given my end-goal? 70F is pretty middle-ground for recommended puerh temp but what about in the context of my end-goal? I’d get a second humidor to temp control at 60F and even a third at 80F or something but I’m not about to drop a couple hundred more dollars in the name of science lol. Maybe a future experiment if I ever get so much tea I need more Humidors but that won't be anytime too soon if at all. Thanks in advance!",2,1758576500.0,Puerh,0,1.0,False

Next to the lobby is the café which serves amazing crapes, ice cream, snacks, and coffee drinks. It has a lounge too for those who need to sit. One long hallway in the lobby building hosts almost every restaurant, bowling, spa, gym, teens club, and night club. Walking is necessary since the resort is large, but there are very well labeled shuttle stops that goes around the resort. Outside the main lobby building are a number of pools including an adults only pool and a water park which is both kid and adult friendly. I haven’t been on a water tub slide in years and went several times for the small thrill! The lazy river is kind of small for the size of the property, but kids would still enjoy it.  
The buildings are sprawled around the property. I was in building 91 where my room faced the water park. I didn’t mind because I wasn’t in the room a lot, but could pose a noise problem. However, the rooms are huge! Beautiful bathrooms with double sinks, water closet, walk in shower, etc. The jacuzzi tub is outside of the bathroom in the living area that has a table with two chairs for dining.

Room service is available and there are buttons inside the door that highlight “do not disturb” and “please make up room” instead of flimsy signs to hang on the door.

My favorite was the fresh juice options and the pre-made toast points including an easy egg on toast, avocado toast, and salmon and cream cheese toast. I also had breakfast at Habibi which was a nice change for a unique spin on breakfast. Los Tacos was yummy for you guessed it tacos. I was highly impressed by the fresh fish at the various restaurants too. The service was amazing.

I remember trying to open that stubborn jar of pickles last week, my hand just wouldn't cooperate. It’s funny how you don’t think about your grip until it’s gone. After I sprained my wrist gardening, my whole hand felt like it belonged to someone else—weak and a little unreliable for the simplest things, like writing or even holding a coffee mug steady.



It’s a strange feeling, that vulnerability. You start noticing all the tiny moments you need strength you took for granted. I found myself trying to gently squeeze a soft stress ball, but it felt so passive, like it wasn't really helping me build anything back, just going through the motions.



Then, my brother, who’s always tinkering with something, left this simple-looking contraption on my desk. It had a spring in the middle and two textured handles. At first, I’d just press it mindlessly while reading or watching TV, not expecting much. But the resistance was different; it was consistent and measurable. I could actually feel a specific muscle in my forearm waking up after days of being dormant.



The real surprise came a few weeks later. I wasn’t even thinking about it when I reached for a heavy book and my hand just… held on. It was a small victory, but it felt significant. That simple, repetitive motion had quietly reacquainted my hand with its own strength, which felt less like exercise and more like rediscovery. It’s back to being just my hand again, which is exactly what I wanted.

Dito isso, os criadores do Adguard, uBlock Origin, ReVanced, etc. têm vagas reservadas no céu, seus serviços são extremamente importantes para os internautas do século XXI.

1nnyzil,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Flimsy-Gift-3115/comments/1nnyzil/primeshred_review_does_this_fat_burner_really_work/,PrimeShred Review: Does This Fat Burner Really Work?,"When it comes to fat burners, the market is full of bold claims and flashy marketing, making it difficult to separate hype from reality. PrimeShred has gained attention as a “hardcore fat burner” designed to help users shed stubborn fat, increase energy, and stay mentally focused while dieting. But does it actually deliver, or is it just another supplement overpromising results? Let’s break down what PrimeShred offers, how it works, and whether it lives up to its reputation.

# What Is PrimeShred?

[PrimeShred](http://yourfitnessapp.com/primeshred-review/) is a weight-loss supplement marketed primarily toward those looking to maximize fat burning while preserving lean muscle. It is commonly used during “cutting” phases when the goal is to reduce body fat without sacrificing muscle definition. Unlike generic fat burners, PrimeShred emphasizes three main benefits: fat burning through thermogenesis, increased energy and focus, and protection against muscle breakdown during calorie restriction.

# The Formula and Key Ingredients

The effectiveness of any supplement depends largely on its formula. PrimeShred uses a transparent label approach, listing exact dosages of each ingredient rather than hiding behind a “proprietary blend.” Some of the standout components include:

* **Green Tea Extract** – rich in catechins, known to stimulate metabolism and promote fat oxidation.
* **Caffeine Anhydrous** – boosts energy, alertness, and thermogenesis, helping users push through tough workouts.
* **Cayenne Pepper Extract** – increases calorie burn by raising core body temperature.
* **Green Coffee Bean Extract** – contains chlorogenic acids that may aid fat metabolism.
* **L-Tyrosine and L-Theanine** – amino acids that support mental clarity and focus, especially during calorie deficits.
* **Rhodiola Rosea** – an adaptogen that helps combat fatigue and stress.

These ingredients are well-researched individually, and together they target both physical and mental aspects of fat loss.

# Does It Really Work?

User reports suggest that PrimeShred can deliver noticeable results when combined with a structured diet and regular exercise. Many people highlight improved energy levels, sharper focus during workouts, and faster fat loss compared to diet alone. Some claim it helped reduce stubborn belly fat while maintaining muscle mass, which aligns with the product’s core promise.

However, it’s important to note that PrimeShred is not a magic pill. Like any fat burner, it works best when paired with a calorie deficit and consistent training. Those expecting dramatic transformations without lifestyle changes are likely to be disappointed.

# Potential Side Effects

Because PrimeShred contains stimulants, side effects are possible. Some users report jitters, digestive discomfort, or trouble sleeping if taken too late in the day. Anyone sensitive to caffeine should be cautious, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions should consult a doctor before use.

# Final Verdict

So, does PrimeShred really work? The answer is **yes, but with realistic expectations**. The formula includes science-backed ingredients that can modestly enhance fat loss, improve energy, and support focus. For healthy adults committed to diet and exercise, PrimeShred can be a valuable tool to accelerate results. Still, it isn’t a substitute for discipline in the kitchen or consistency in the gym.

If used wisely, PrimeShred can be more than just another supplement—it can be the edge that helps you push through plateaus and reveal the physique you’ve been working toward.",1,1758576066.0,u_Flimsy-Gift-3115,0,1.0,False

1nnyx6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/1nnyx6b/duggar_digest_08/,Duggar Digest #08,"Here's the latest from all of the Duggar's socials!

**HALF THE FAMILY GOES TO FLORIDA (ETA - This is a new video of a vacation that happened in 2024. Holy Hanna I was confused! No wonder there were missing babies and Katey looked pregnant!)**

We learned from Jana's most recent YouTube video that \*\*in 2024\*\* about half of the family gathered somewhere in Florida for a beach vacation to celebrate Michelle’s 58th birthday.

Michelle shrinks a millimeter for every grandchild born to this family, while JB’s non-alcoholic beer belly expands at the same ratio. 

In attendance:

* JB, Meech, and Lost Kids (James, Jackson, Hannie, Jinnifer, Jordin, & Josie)
* Jana & Stephen
* Planes & Abbie, Grace & Charlie
* Jessa, Bin, Preachers, & Plants
* Joe, Kindra, & their 4 Blurs
* Josiah, Lauren, & Alphabet Blurs
* OGJed, Katey, Norah, Tru-it
* JerJed, Hannah, Brin-lee, Brielle, & Emery

The vacation rental had a ton of space, a huge kitchen, TV, pool, hot tub, corn hole, and was a quick walk to the beach. Vacation activities included a jigsaw puzzle, games like QuipLash, Dutch Blitz, and corn hole; walks on the beach; swimming a bunch; family workouts; watching sports; taking beige family photos; and singing hymns. If you didn’t know better, you would think this is one big, boring, happy family! 

A few random tidbits from Jana’s video: Lauren was the photographer for the “official” family shots. Joe & Kindra are now blurring their kids’ faces. (Good on them.) Jana was good at blurring faces in photos, but with videos she didn’t bother (although she pans quickly enough that it’s hard to distinguish one grandkid from another). All the Lost Girls and Michelle are still wearing skirts and/or fundy-approved swimwear, but the rest of the kids seem to be able to dress however they want without retribution. 

**ANNA THE BREEDER IS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME ON TIK-TOK**

Anna is continuing to use her kids in short shorts to promote her puppy mill business. Mason is prominently featured this week with hair that snarkers say kinda resembles a cross between a pompadour and a mullet. (Go check out [that thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/1nnspl1/what_is_masons_haircut_called/), because the comments are hilarious!) Most of her posts have cringey captions that seem to be ripped from TikTok trends, like “Nothing beats a Jet2 Holiday.” (I’m not on TikTok, so I had to Google that one to know what she was talking about). She also made a corny menopause joke: *When women get to a certain age they start collecting dogs and cats. “Many Paws.”* (Since Daddy Dearest is in prison, she has to take up the Dad Jokes mantle.) She makes sure to put rich adjectives about the puppies in her IG bio: “Elegant ✨ Distinguished ✨ Loyal” Here’s hoping these puppies know more about loyalty than her incarcerated husband does! 

**J’ABBIE & KATEY LOVE RHEA-LANA’S!**

Since announcing her latest pregnancy, J’Abbie has been fairly quiet on the ‘gram other than to promote Rhea Lana’s Consignment Sale. She teamed up with her favorite sister-in-LOVE Kathy to make a cringy reel about how much they love their finds from RL. When popping out kids is your entire personality, this annual consignment sale is the highlight of the year! 

**JILL ENJOYS “FALL RHYTHMS”**

It’s still in the 80s (the temperature, not the decade), but hippie Jill and her extensions are embracing “fall rhythms.” No, she isn’t talking about a drum circle. She’s talking about family trips to Silver Dollar City, fresh taffy, homemade pumpkin donuts and cinnamon rolls, swim lessons, “good fellowship” on “Name Tag Sunday” at church, letting her kids hang out with Famy’s kids and D’Wreck’s brother Dan’s kids, garden flowers and cucamelons, pickled eggs, Great Value buffalo cauliflower, piano lessons, pony rides and corn mazes, homeschooling, watching Fresh Prince, and scavenging firewood off the side of the road.  

**JESSA HITS SIX WEEKS POSTPARTUM AFTER BIRTH OF “YOUR ROYAL FATNESS”**

Sometimes, the snark titles write themselves. Jessa dropped some new content this past week celebrating her latest “15 lbs of cuteness” (aka Eddie aka Clickbait Seewald aka “Your Royal Fatness”). In her latest vlog, she takes scissors to her hair in a haphazard attempt to save money by cutting her own layers while rambling on about life with (now) six kids. She seems fairly chill and relaxed as she tells how this has been her easiest transition yet. They jumped back into homeschooling about a week after Eddie was born. This year they are doing aBeka for history and science, Teaching Textbooks for math, “Easy Grammar,” a Biblical Greek curriculum (Bin is teaching that one), and a lot of rhyming songs to learn grammar facts & geography. The boys are back in Christian Boy Scouts (aka Trail Life) and the kids are taking piano lessons. In between her ramblings, she promoted Crunch Labs, Hungry Root meals, a few books by dead Puritans, the Train Well Fitness app, and Voetberg Music Academy online lessons. We also got serenaded by an off-key child screeching Amazing Grace at the top of her lungs, which Jessa calls, “so cute” and a “joyful noise.” Lost Child Henry got a lava lamp which (to avoid getting broken during wrestling) was moved to grace their mantle. Jessa says it gives their beige home a “pop of color” (alongside a Rembrandt painting). 

Today she took to her stories as a Christian Healthcare Ministries partner with itemized bills of what it cost to have her latest baby ($75,234.40) to tell us that with CHM, she only paid $2500 out of pocket. 

**OUT IN CALI…**

…Jeremy celebrated his 38th birthday and is honored with several posts from his friends and adoring wife. (At least her words are adoring, anyway.) Jinger continued with the Duggar family tradition of hanging handmade happy birthday signs on the walls. 

The Vuolo’s IG feeds continue to feature the backs of their kids’ heads, random LA hotspots, and very blurry photos of fascinating things like Fruit Loops containers and power lines. Just what everyone wants to see from their least favorite influencers. 

On the podcast, they did a riveting episode announcing Jana’s pregnancy, which is BRAND NEW INFORMATION. Then they discussed some of their top jinder reveal parties from the family. Jinger rightly stated, “I feel like our family lives for jinder reveals,” and I don’t think truer words have ever been spoken. She talks about the pressure to “get creative” and “think outside the box” because, in a family with so many grandkids, you are always trying to top the last one. 

With Finn, they did some sort of crazy giant Connect 4 game that was interesting in theory but overly complicated and very poorly executed…almost revealing the wrong jinder to the family. Wouldn’t that have been a travesty!

As far as Duggar family jinder reveals, with so many pilots in the family, things have gotten pretty out of hand. They showed a recent jinder reveal that involved a jeep on fire getting driven into a lake with fireworks overhead. I don’t even wanna know what’s next. 

Jeremy, of course, had to wax spiritual about jinder reveals: *“It is a celebration of life. I think in our culture it’s so important to see people getting excited about the baby in the womb, and excited about discovering their gender. Which isn’t going to tell you everything about that child, but it’s an exciting facet of who that child is and who God created them to be.”*

Then Charlie Kirk was shot and their content shifted to capitalizing on this tragedy as well as Erin’s Bate’s battle with sepsis. They did an entire podcast episode about this “heavy season” with thumbnails of their sad faces overlaid with the text “IT’S BEEN A DARK WEEK.” To their credit, they also mentioned the mass shooting at Evergreen High School and the killing of Irina Zarutska. They talked their audience through Erin’s battle and praised her for her “example and testimony” while in the hospital. “Whatever’s inside will come out in those hard seasons…you see the true heart of a person, what they’re really made of comes out in suffering.” I guess what Erin’s made of is Sugar and Not-at-all-Spice and Everything Nice because that’s all that’s come out of her. They then re-shared the highly exploitative video of Chad reading Erin’s daughter’s letter. 

In between long ads for Range Leather, Rocket Money, Function Health, and Brooklyn Bedding—they talked about the cognitive dissonance that comes from trying to process these events and how much we need good theology: 

*“You have this season of rejoicing because a baby’s been born. Then immediate chaos, uncertainty, anxiety, because she goes into shock. You’re looking at a life born and a life being threatened. It’s almost too much to take. You don’t know how to process that. As humans, we’re not designed for this brokenness. This brokenness should feel unnatural. Like the birth of a child, it’s natural to celebrate. It is unnatural to then face the threat of the mother’s life being lost. That is not how we were made. That’s not how we were designed. That’s not how God designed this world. And so, something has gone terribly wrong…every time we grieve, every time we cry, every time we feel the brokenness and pain of this world, it is a recognition. It’s a theological reality screaming at us of our experience, you know, something’s wrong. One of our friends, Dave Muxlow, said, ‘You better get your theology right before you need it’…you need to get your theology right now so that when you need it, you have it.”*

They said that the “assassination” of Charlie Kirk has been “so traumatizing for our nation,” because “they saw Charlie as representing freedom of speech and open dialogue, which is kind of what this country has built on, this ability to disagree and disagree vehemently, but not to demonize the other side.” Then they compared his death to that of Stephen, the first martyr of the Christian church. 

Jinger actually had no idea who he was until she heard the news in a group chat with her family, but Jeremy was “fascinated by his debates and his dialogues.” Once she Googled him, she saw all of his videos circulating and was convinced fairly quickly that he was ""someone who loves Christ.” (Both of them watched the CK memorial yesterday and reshared clips and quotes on their stories.)

“SEASON” count: 6

Today, Jinger shared a clip of herself playing Great is Thy Faithfulness on the piano. I was kinda shocked. I know the girls played the piano on the show, but I don’t think I’ve seen any of them play for a LONG time, even though they are always showing the pianos in their homes! The girl still has some great talent. Her piano is in desperate need of a tuning, though! 

**JOY: LIVING HER BEST INFLUENCER LIFE**

Joy jetted off to Florida for her sister in law’s beach bachelorette weekend, and got someone to take pictures of her taking selfies and videoing so that she could then post those pictures with the caption “Influencer spotted in the wild.” At home, she spends most of her time modeling outfits from Amazon, linking to everything in her house, making Hello Fresh meals, and playing/promoting her favorite phone game Sunshine Island. 

In other news, she and Austin may have finally found a house after 2 years of house hunting.  

**JASEJED & MADDIE CELEBRATE THEIR 1ST ANNIVERSARY**

Jase and Maddie’s Instagram feeds are basically a continuation of their honeymoon. While they still have ways to go to beat Claritin’s child-free record, they are definitely pushing babies far off into the horizon. They are enjoying coffee shops, date nights, beach trips, shopping, and sushi. Maddie is also promoting Christian Bible study books and linking to them on Amazon. 

**FAMY: STILL DESPERATE FOR ATTENTION**

Famy absolutely cannot WAIT for her book to drop next month. In the meantime, she and her husband celebrated their 10th anniversary at the fancy Hotel Avail in Rogers. It’s unclear if this was a splurge or a sponsored trip, but based on the gifts and perks they received from the hotel, I’m guessing it’s the latter. They also shared photos and video of them walking through the hotel hallways, so it’s almost like they had a photographer in tow, and I don’t think it was Daxy Dearest. They enjoyed an expensive meal complete with drinks and dessert at the rooftop Oak Steakhouse on the top floor of the hotel. The restaurant gave them a framed photo of themselves and a card signed by their whole staff. 

After sharing and sharing and sharing all of the photos from this little “staycation,” Amy has spent the last few weeks sharing all of her thoughts on all of the things, from “toxic people” to “pew pews.” She criticized her fellow Christian influencers for not being loving enough while wearing a shirt that says something about “death” and has skeletons being joyfully available for one another. In another reel she half-sang-half-lip-synced to the song “Where’s the Love?” by the Black Eyed Peas, again pointing fingers at her unloving fellow Christians who don’t practice what they preach. 

Famy got a full shipment of her books at her doorstep in the lead-up to her book-launch, which she celebrated by taking God’s name in vain over and over and over (how very Christian of her!) and criticizing her husband’s camera angle and lighting. She says we are just “not ready” for everything in this book, and here I’m secretly hoping there will be some juicy Duggar tidbits, but I’m doubtful. 

**TATOR TOTS: THIS AND THAT FROM THE DUGGARVERSE**

David Pecan-Thief Waller celebrated his 39th birthday with his adoring wife and seven children before jetting off to the Ukraine to pass out Chick tracts and encourage missionaries during “this challenging season of war.” Anna’s other sister and brother-in-law John & Esther are “under one of the greatest Satanic attacks” of their 24 years of full-time ministry, including “curses and witchcraft.” They are so thankful for those who pray for them because the prayers have “life and death” importance and “eternal consequences.” Hilary Spivey broke a LONG silence on Insta to share a picture of her, Claire, and another daughter attending the Turning Point Young Women’s Leadership Summit earlier this summer, where they got to hear Charlie and Erika Kirk speak. I didn’t realize that hardcore IBLPers would be in favor of young women being leaders, but here we are. 

Happy Monday and Happy Snarking!

Ofc in isolation, the act of buying (well producing) a new phone is harmful for the environment and for workers.
So it’s better to hold on to your old phone as long as possible.

But by that logic we should keep phones for 10-15 or even more years, to the point where they become seriously unpractical to use in the modern world.
And you can extend it to all kind consumption from toys to games to chocolate and coffee.

Personally I think everyone should get to have a few luxuries. What those luxuries are (like a new phone or loads of fancy coffee or a new dress) everyone should choose for themselves.

You probably shouldn’t feel bad about any individual choice as long as your overall consumption isn’t ridiculously high.",0,1758575546.0,iphone,2,0.5,False

I’m currently planning a 19 days trip (well, 17 days in the country itself as travel time is 2 days) with our 3 children. They’re 12, 6 and 4, well travelled (meaning used to long trips, drives, active days spent with full day sight-seeing, eating in restaurants etc). Walking around or taking 2-4 hours trips by train/bus is also totally normal for them.

I’m thinking spending:
- 2-3 days in Gyeongju
- 3 days on Jeju (+ rent a car)
- 3-4 days in Busan
- 7-9 days in Seoul

My 2 oldest (girls) are obsessed with K-pop, cute stationary lines, characters/ plushies etc while our boy is a big fan of all kind of vehicles (especially bullet trains and such, airplanes etc). We’re keen to try a lot of different places to eat (street food and normal priced options not fancy restaurants, coffee places etc), shopping (especially skin care) and experience as much as we can about Korean history/ culture/ vibe etc.

We’re less interested in theatre and other programs that requires kids to sit still for longer period of time 😂 also night time activities are not for us, we’ll be back to our accommodation around 7-8pm(ish).

I’d love to hear any inputs on the timeline I’m planning and anything we should defo see/ try/ experience

M25. I dated a man for 4 months. He is 42. Ok, he's 17 years older than me, but we both knew it when we started. While I was very easy about it, he always worried. He even asked his ex and some other straight friends that are in a relationship with older people and they all said it was okay and there was nothing to worry about. After July he stopped complaining about our age gap and I thought we were over that.

Note that, through all these months, we did a lot of things together, had our specific love (or affection, more properly) language and gestures.. he even gave me a very sweet present.

But 10 days ago everything changed. He started being cold to me, refused to kiss me with silly excuses such as you drank coffee and you know I hate it etc. And yesterday the bomb exploded. We had an amazing day with a couple of friends and before leaving each other for the night we had some time alone. And, after intense making out (!!!), I mentioned I was worried about him being weird to me. 
So everything came out:
- he feels good being on his own
- I'm too young and he feels that
- I just started working, while he's deeply developing his career and wants to focus on it. If we both have professional problems, none of us can properly being supportive to each other
- I could lose important professional opportunities to stay with him.

When I replied that everything was okay and that he should have more faith in me, he broke out and said that decisions have to be made in 2 and not just me (I argued that I don't mind professional opportunities, I'd rather create my own ""family"" with my bf).

Today I felt like a train hit me. I was depressed and disgusted. Then at 5 pm he texted me to know if I was good and I waited till 9 pm to text him back a simple ""good"".
Right now I'm hurt and so is my pride, but I don't wanna be harsh on him because his life wasn't easy. He had a difficult past and right now he's having professional troubles. I tried my best to make him feel my nearness, my affection, my presence in these difficult times, but it's clear it was not enough. He doesn't trust me and doesn't trust my efforts. 
Even though everything seemed OK till 10 days ago.
So right now I'm both angry as hell and sad, but I can't decide what to do.

What should I do now? I'm devastated. I miss him a lot and I wish I could reach out to him. We had planned so many things to do together. Even yesterday we talked about a trip we should have made and we seemed to agree about everything. Then everything changed, he said he wants to be alone. And my words arguing about this horrible thing didn't produce any effect.

1nnyj6h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nnyj6h,London Four Seasons at Tower Bridge,"Four Seasons at Tower Bridge is a not-to-be-missed incredible hotel at the foot of The Tower of London, with great rooms, great food and beyond 5* exceptional service and attention.

We are here now and have seen first hand how the entire staff works tirelessly to ensure a seamless, stress-free stay. We were supposed to check out today and head to Edinburgh, but due to unforeseen circumstances, we needed to stay an additional three nights. When we first inquired at the front desk if our room was available for us to extend, we were, unfortunately, told that the entire hotel was booked solid. We sent a quick email to u/sarahwlee that we were going to need some help booking a new hotel; she responded almost immediately despite the time difference, and before we started that process, we got an email from Alyssa here at the Four Seasons. Within 15 minutes, we were offered a 2 bedroom residence at a great price and someone was knocking at our door to help us move our luggage.

This alone would have made the stay worthwhile, but even before this, the stay and service was top notch. Our first room was well appointed, with enough room to stretch out and a large bathroom with separate shower and bathtub. The service in the Rotunda Lounge was wonderfully personal - by our third morning, we didn’t even need to ask for strawberry jam for my toast or almond milk for our coffee. It was waiting for us at the table. Every single staff member greeted us with a smile and genuine care. And I had yummy sushi at Mei Ume (you’ll win me over every time with sushi!)

The area is quiet and I know some people don’t love that, but every morning we enjoyed a walk across the Tower Bridge, along the Thames and back across London Bridge. At night we walked to restaurants and never felt isolated.

Needless to say, we are loving our 2 bedroom residence. I’m not a great photographer but I’ve attached some photos. I wish I had taken pictures of the first room, because it was great as well. 

The quick overview:

Service: 10/10 (If I could I’d give it a higher score!)

Food: 10/10

Rooms 10/10

The goal was to eventually reach a point where we could sell the green coffee from the farm to roasters here in the US, and we are finally at a point of being able to do that. We have the logistics sorted of processing and packing the coffee on site at the farm, and also have a shipping company that would be able to bring the coffee to the US. The problem is we are having trouble finding what a good value for the coffee would be. A big part of the reason is because it is a Venezuelan coffee, which there really isn't very much of on the market these days. So I was hoping maybe the people of this sub would help at least give us a decent idea of what our coffee might be worth.

For frame of reference, this first batch of coffee would be an 86 point Geisha, we have both natural and washed. It is single origin, we have all the details down to the specific location and elevation from where they were harvested, as well as the flavor profile for each one as well.

We were together almost 2 years. We met at summer camp. What drew me in wasn’t only her looks but her whole vibe — this soft, joyful energy. She was joyful,sweet, playful, present. She’d wear my hoodies, pick up my phrases, we did pinky promises, we watched the stars, we had this silly “yellow car = little slap” game, and late-night calls with stupid laughter that felt like home. She could be a bit jealous (in a real human way), but she always supported me — even during my big exams and my music . We also had normal couple stuff: dates, nature trips, I once bought her a phone, inside jokes. It wasn’t “all bad” at all.
At the very beginning (before we were solid), I messed up with another girl who was close to her. She found out a year in. That cracked trust. She stayed and tried, I got defensive.
I started confusing her bids for connection with “accusations.” She’d say “I just want you present,” I heard “you’re blaming me.”
I went hot-and-cold: some days affectionate, other days distant/quiet/cold. I raised my voice sometimes, argued over small things, stopped the small acts and said things I really regret. 
Routine hit and I didn’t fight it. Ego > presence.
told myself breaking up would “prevent us from ending up hating each other.” Truth: I was scared, selfish, and blind to what mattered.
The breakup was gradual distance. Not a master plan it was more like death by a thousand missed moments. Then I ended it although she said she wanted to fight for us .At first I felt relieved, like a weight was gone. Weeks later it slammed me. I kept stalking, replaying memories, and when I left my city for  summer work it all crashed: paranoia, guilt, the “what did I do?” loop. I tried talking to her ( i begged ) but she said she was happy with herself and that it was better for both of us to keep it that way she wished me the best 
I know I’m not the victim
Now (3 months later):
My days are a loop: coffee, cigarettes, phone scrolling, sleep. I try to see friends but feel like a ghost. I wake up thinking of her and go to sleep the same. I went to uni counseling once; it didn’t click (I’ll try again). My mom struggles with psychosis, so home can be rough , father is dead and there are no other family members . Money’s tight. I know I’ve talked about her too much to friends. I’m scared I’m turning pain into an identity.
The thought that kills me is that “I’ll never find any girl like her” : I did nothing when it mattered and lost an exceptional girl who only wanted presence.I feel so alone man my friends got distant and she really felt like the home I never had 
I’m not trying to win her back or break her boundaries again. She asked for distance and I respect that.

I’ve ran a console a handful of times but at this point in my career am more of a tech than I am an LD or programmer.

Furthermore, he’s currently out with one of my favorite bands; if I were to name the #1 act I’d like to work for at a point in my career, that’s the band.

So obviously an incredible opportunity for me to have the chance to speak with this person, but I’m at a bit of a loss for what exactly to ask him. Of course I’m sure we’ll chat about the rig and I’ve got a handful of things I’d like to ask him, but I’m kind of drawing a blank for meaningful things to ask him given the gap we have in experience & also in roles (him being more of a programmer/designer and me a tech).

Hi there. I have a Hibrew Dual espresso machine. I think it's an H10A. Recently I have found the pressure to go off to the red zone and the coffee starts to seep through the outer perimeter of the basket. I noticed it doing this over time where it would get unckogged (sputter under pressure) and it will dispense the coffee.

I thought maybe it's the coffee grounds being too fine but I negated this when I removed the coffee and put an empty filter. Same issue...pressure at max and filled up with water and water seeping from the perimeter. I read about descaling but not sure if this will fix the issue?


I switched to the non dual layer filter and it was able to dispense the coffee.  I also cleaned the screen at the top where the filter connects to. So odd. Anyone experience this?",2,1758573752.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

My 8.5 month old wakes up between 8-9am, I brush her two teef, change her diaper, and take her to the playpen to play with her toys while I get ready for the day. 

I come out and she's already usually done with the playpen and fussy. I give her a bottle. 
I put her back in the playpen briefly while I make some coffee. We then have our usual morning coffee and outside swing for like 30-45 minutes. 

I then bring her in and let her on the jolly jumper for 10-15 minutes as I prepare her meal. I put her in her highchair and feed her. After she's done, I put her in her playpen while I clean up. If she's content, I leave her for a while. 

Then the middle of the day is a blur. We move around from her baby Bjorn bouncer to the couch to the playpen to the swing. She plays with various toys and we practice standing and walking most days. There are some rings in her playpen I'll have her hold and support herself (with me as a safety net, of course). Shes not super interested in using her push walker yet. Ive been wanting to buy her a seated walker or just a sit up chair but I read its not productive or safe, so I just dont know what else to add to my arsenal of entertainment lol. I think she'd really enjoy that seated walker and I dont have anything in the house that'd pose a safety threat to her, like stairs. 

Later in the evening we usually go for a walk, which she enjoys a lot. I used to wear her front facing but now I use the Osprey backpack. I noticed she doesnt mind being carried as I do stuff around the house but it gets tiring. 

After the walk, we'll hang out a bit more on the couch, play, read some books, then get ready for bed. 

I'm a FTM and I'm alone mostly all day so I'm not sure what else I can and should be doing for her. Its also so hard to get work done in the house because she has started SCREAMING at me if I dont give her attention, which is super exhausting. I just wear earphones all day. 

What other activities, toys, or attention can I offer her? I feel like I'm not doing enough. Im working on getting my floors and carpet sanitized so I can let her explore. She definitely wants to but I'm limiting her due to cleanliness.

1nnxwpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Asexual/comments/1nnxwpy/yoidk_why_boobs_are_so_sexualized/,Yo……idk why boobs are so sexualized….,"Like….its just boobs

Like, yes, there are ppl who find it sexually appealing ( which is ok, i don’t get why they do. But its still ok )

But sometimes it feels like ppl oversexualized it so much ( and i mean SO MUCH ) to the point that if they see someone who has a bigger chest, they become targeted BADLY

Sir….WHAT????

Like, they dont Even do anything. They would talking abt how they are eating pineapples or just talking about CHEESE. But ppl would go insane abt their chest ( im talking abt social media. I have noticed ppl doing this. Even with other ppls OCs. They would hate on them bc of the characters having a larger chest and then accuse them of fetishizing. The OCs was just drinking coffee btw )

I don’t get why everything is so sexualized.

Feets are sexualized, armpits…SEXUALIZED, and boobs…SEXUALIZED TO THE CORE.

And again, i am not talking abt ppl who find it sexually appealing.

I am talking abt ppl only thinking that boobs are just sexual and sexual ONLY and then shame on others for having a bigger chest bc to them its ‘’ fetishizing ‘’ even though the person was not showing any behaviour of fetishizing bigger chest.

( someone even sexualized a woman BREASTFEEDING THEIR CHILD……ARE YOU KIDDING ME )

Like, dont get me wrong, i do think boobs have an aesthetic appeal. Like in clothes and would fit their shape and all. Or like a renaissance painting.

Heck it could Even be used as pillows! And you can also hear someones heartbeat when lying on them so i don’t mind them.

I just hate how its so oversexualized to the point that ppl don’t see it differently

It makes me go insane bc most ppl are just oversexualizing it so much. Idk if its Even just me tbh

Does anyone relate?

I Hope this post isnt too insensitive. Bc i don’t want it to be. Its just that i have noticed this pattern everywhere and its getting tiring bc of how its so….yk.sexualized.

So yeah, i am very sorry if this post sounded insensitive. Pls let me know if it is so i wont do the same mistake again.

1nnxuqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1nnxuqv/food_report_chiang_mai_thailand_nimman_area_july/,"Food Report Chiang Mai, Thailand – Nimman Area (July 17 – Aug 15, 2025)","I was based in Nimman for a month as a nomad and wanted to share what I noticed about the food scene. This is just the amount of restaurants per cuisine I saw (in rough order of abundance). I didn’t try everything, so this is more observation than a definitive guide.

**Thai**  
The dish you’ll see everywhere is *Khao Soi*, a curry noodle soup usually served with a chicken drumstick and crispy fried noodles. Unique flavour, rich broth, and unavoidable in Chiang Mai. Pad Kra Pow (minced meat stir-fried with holy basil and rice) is also everywhere, though I think it’s a bit overrated. Pad Thai is around too. Even in a month with everything to try I still wasn't able to have as much Thai food as I wanted.

There is also Thai boat noodles which I loved in terms of the soup/noodles but I was not a fan of the meat balls they put in them. Texture was like a cheap hotdog.

Street food is part of the scene: motorbike stalls selling coconut ice cream, longan fruit, grilled chicken and pork ribs, mango sticky rice. I tried a few BBQ stalls at the markets – decent but nothing mind-blowing. The standout was a quirky stall dedicated solely to Japanese mushrooms on skewers.

There are a few stores solely dedicated to mango and durian based desserts. There was also 2 brownie dessert shops one I went to had brownie shots in mini cups and you pour your chosen sauce over each so its drenched. It was amazing.

**Japanese**  
This is where Nimman shines. The quantity and quality of Japanese food is off the charts. Main strengths are curry cutlet rice, ramen, sushi, yakitori, izakaya bars, takoyaki, and plenty of matcha desserts. The one thing missing? Hamburger steak , there was barely 2 restaurants in the area serving it.

There’s even a chain called *The Volcano* serving sweet cheese toast (small portions but tasty). Loads of Hokkaido milk based desserts too. Ice creams and cakes made etc with the sweeter, premium milk from Hokkaido. On the high end you’ve got a couple Wagyu steakhouses and luxury sushi, but some yakitori bars are affordable and seriously good.

Botan restaurant was a hidden gem.

**Chinese**  
Plenty of hot pot, Sichuan, Hainanese chicken rice, and Hong Kong–style food. All excellent, which makes sense given the number of Chinese tourists. I only went to a couple but I am too much of a noob to try hot pot for the first time solo in another country.

Plenty of pecking duck as well. I wasn't a fan of the hanainese white chicken rice even with the satay sauce it was a bit bland but the fried chicken at those places is good.

**Craft cafes**

Literally heaven Roast8ry , Saruda pastry, FOOHIDE, Charlie Thai tea some really unique drinks. Also a few smoothie dedicated joints like Joost or Goodsmood that looked cool. Didn't try those two but will when I revisit.

Was able to take home 3 thai tea bags from Charlie Thai tea for £13. Drinks there are something straight out of a high end cocktail bar and are all under £2.50 Best Thai tea I have ever had.

There is a growing culture with promotion from the government around locally grown coffee, chocolate tea as well which is interesting.

**Korean**  
a few Korean barbeque spots as well as non KBBQ. I did go to 2 Korean restaurants twice. I didn't like either of them I mean the first time I got Tteokbokki , way too sweet and spicy in a way that doesn't go together tbh. 

Then got Ramyun noodles at a restaurant. Just red spice with literally no other flavour whatsoever had a chewy texture like some fancy korean instant Ramen noodles I have tried. K BBQ was a bit out of budget that time. The seafood pancake I got wasn't as good as the Japanese version okonomiyaki agai it lacked flavour and no garnish sauce. Just my opinion doe. 

**Vietnamese**  
Mostly the classics: banh mi and pho. Solid but not nearly as dominant as Japanese or Chinese. I only had Bhan Mi once. This was another cuisine I really wanted to more try but the restaurants just happened to be further out.

**American / Western**  
A fair amount of wings, burgers, and pizza joints. Nothing groundbreaking compared to back home, but the quality is still good. I did try a makeshift wood-fired pizza stall  really tasty, but pricey at about £8 per pizza.

**Burmese**  
A couple of places around. I tried a noodle soup with good broth, but the noodles were thin, small, and slippery not my favorite texture. I did like the Burmese tea it was at 'the 90s burmese cafe' I think

**South Indian**  
A handful of vegetarian restaurants. Limited in number, but the one I visited were solid. Got the Thali which was 2 meals.

**Other**  
Everything else drops off after that. Middle Eastern food was rare I only spotted one or two places on Google Maps and didn’t go to any. Probably still wouldn't as I eat it a lot at home where I live. 

Nimman feels like a genuine food hub. If you’re into coffee ,Thai , Japanese and Chinese especially, you’ll be spoiled rotten.

All aboard, the next stop on the MTA’s IBX (Interborough Express) is trendy and hoppin’ Myrtle Avenue in Glendale and Ridgewood, Queens. 

As the IBX, a 14-mile light-rail line proposed by the MTA to connect Queens and Brooklyn, continues its southward journey, it arrives at Myrtle Avenue, the last stop in Queens and likely the first station to be located above street level.

The proposed station is square in the middle of a vivacious shopping district in Glendale and Ridgewood (the rail line borders both communities) that’s lined with thrift and antique stores, beauty salons and cafes and restaurants. In essence, it’s a delightful oasis where a New Yorker can spend an exciting afternoon antique hunting and end the day with a delicious dinner.

Some might call the area a hipster’s paradise.

Gentrification in Ridgewood and Glendale
Located on the Glendale-Ridgewood border, the Myrtle Avenue stop is in a neighborhood that has been experiencing gentrification for more than a decade. East and west of the proposed stop are local shops and restaurants offering international cuisine.

Neighborhood-goers can enjoy Latin American fare while dining al fresco or a cocktail at various spots, including the quaint Mon Cheri Italian bar and restaurant.

Fresh Pond Road, which starts right at the proposed IBX station, runs for several miles and offers almost any fare a foodie could imagine. The street is lined with ethnic restaurants that inspire a true sense of adventure. Polish, German, Thai, Cuban, Chinese and so much more is available to tantalize taste buds. Traditional Polish delis and Italian bakeries also offer food reminiscent of “the old country.” 

Anyone looking forward to using the IBX to get to work would be in for a morning treat. Plenty of authentic New York coffee and bagel joints surround the area of the proposed Myrtle Avenue station. 

The neighborhood has a Williamsburg, Brooklyn, hipster vibe. Gentrification has hit the area particularly hard — many real estate sites such as Zillow and Realtor.com have one-bedroom apartments in Ridgewood going for an average of about $3,000 a month these days — prompting some residents to lament losing their “neighborhood charm.” 

The IBX has massive support from transit officials, Gov. Kathy Hochul, and MTA board members, who approved the project’s $166 million design contract on July 30. 

Neighborhood character, City of Yes and real estate
But not everyone is on board with the massive project, which is right now expected to cost around $5.5 billion once it’s complete.

Queens City Council Member Robert Holden, whose district includes parts of the IBX route, told amNewYork in a recent interview that the plan leaves him with many unanswered questions. 

“They essentially want to change the character of our neighborhood,” Holden said. “We love the fact that we can sit in our backyards and feel the sunshine on our faces. Anything that jeopardizes that, you really have to fight it.”

Gary Giordano, district manager of Queens Community Board 5, shared his thoughts on the IBX with amNewYork.

“If you are a public transit user, you probably like it because it gives you other options,” Giordano said. “In Queens and in a lot of New York City, it’s easy to get to Manhattan, but to get from one portion of the borough to another other than buses via train, there are not too many options.”

That is the good part, the Queens resident said. 

“The difficult parts of it, I think, are just on a very simple level. How is the passenger train going to be able to coexist with the freight trains that are already there?” he asked.

The tracks for the current CSX freight train, which carries local trash, run along the planned route for the IBX. The tracks are located next to many stores and offices in Glendale and Ridgewood, including the community board’s headquarters on Myrtle Avenue.

Giordano posed a question: Will residents and workers in the area have more freight trains idling in front of their homes and businesses? 

The freight trains already engage in a lot of activity on the tracks above Myrtle Avenue. This includes train coupling, when rail cars are joined together, which can be “a very noisy endeavor,” according to Giordano.

“And they are doing a lot of this after 11 p.m.,” he said.  

amNewYork contacted the MTA to inquire about freight train activity and possible idling near Myrtle Avenue. An MTA spokesperson explained that the IBX will not be sharing or crossing with any freight tracks, so it will not impact freight service.

In the meantime, the agency’s design phase will include engineering surveys, geotechnical and environmental investigations and structure inspections that will set the foundation for moving to the next phase of the work. 

Echoing some of Holden’s statements, Giordano said that there is concern about development. 

“From the standpoint of neighborhood charm, it could be made nice,” he said. “But here’s the kicker. I think there is concern that with the City of Yes proposal for additional housing, that if you are in reasonable proximity to a train station, what is the risk of development that is out of character with the existing housing?”

The houses that fill the area include swaths of apartments and well-kept multi-family brownstones. City officials have said the City of Yes will spark the construction of 82,000 new housing units over the next 15 years. It is too early to estimate how many — or if any — additional homes will be built near IBX stops. 

Meanwhile, as IBX plans continue to chug along, Ridgewood and Glendale are two New York neighborhood gems waiting to be explored.

Next week, amNewYork will bring readers to the next planned stop on the IBX: Wilson Avenue.

**June 5, 2025**  
Heard about the old factory on Filetairou today while grabbing coffee in Pagrati. Some locals whispering about screams at night and ""blood"" streaking the windows—like something out of a bad horror flick. The place was ELFA Pharmaceuticals back in the '30s, mixed quinine with junk to scam people during malaria scares. Killed folks, they say. Then it became a doll factory, churning out those creepy Κούκλες Κεχαγιά things—big-eyed porcelain kids that stare right through you. Neighbors act weird, like guard dogs. Decided to start simple: downloaded a free ghost-hunting app for EVP recordings on my phone. Snuck up after dark, heart pounding like a drum. Got within 20 feet before a light flicked on next door and some old guy yelled in Greek. Bolted. No audio, just static. But I swear I heard a faint child's laugh on the wind. Shook me up—couldn't sleep. Starting to wonder if I'm cut out for this.

**June 12, 2025**  
Dug into history at the National Library. Found grainy articles from 1934: ELFA's owner, some shady character named Dimitris Papadopoulos, adulterated quinine with industrial alcohol and cellulose scraps. Dozens died in Athens slums—feverish hallucinations, bleeding from the mouth. Factory shut down in '47 amid scandals, reopened in the '50s as a toy maker. Κούκλες Κεχαγιά boomed, exporting those dolls worldwide till the '80s. Folklore angle: old wives' tales about ""cursed playthings"" in Pagrati, dolls moving on their own. Bought a cheap EMF meter online—should arrive tomorrow. Visited the site at dusk. Meter spiked near the gate, but so did my anxiety. Tripped on overgrown roots running from a barking dog next door. Scraped my knee bloody. That night, dreamed of glassy-eyed dolls whispering my name. Woke sweating. This is messing with my head already.

**June 20, 2025**  
EMF meter's here—feels legit, like I'm a pro now. Calibrated it in my flat, then hit Filetairou at noon when it's quiet. Slipped past the gate (it's rusted, no lock). Inside, air thick with dust and mold, like breathing history. Doll molds everywhere, shattered porcelain limbs crunching underfoot. Meter went wild in the old pharma wing—electromagnetic pulses like a heartbeat. Recorded whispers on my phone: ""Play... with me..."" Played it back later; sounded like a kid. But climbing the stairs, a loose board gave way—fell hard, twisted my ankle. Limped home, popped painkillers. Neighbors spotted me from a balcony, shouted threats. Paranoia kicking in: keep glancing over my shoulder on the metro. Slept with the light on. Why does this place pull at me?

Research day—no visits. Scoured online forums and dusty archives. Turns out ELFA wasn't just adulterating; rumors of ""test batches"" on homeless folks in the '40s, locking them in for ""trials."" Post-war, the doll factory hired ex-workers—cheap labor, haunted by guilt? Folklore ties in: Greek tales of ""paidia phantasmata"" (ghost children) from the malaria era, seeking revenge on the living. Ordered a thermal camera—should catch cold spots. Ankle's still throbbing; used the downtime to edit footage. Slow-mo shows a shadow darting behind me in the stairwell. Was it real? My hands shake when I watch it. Girlfriend noticed I'm distant—snapped at her over dinner. This is taking a toll.

**July 10, 2025**  
Thermal cam arrived—game-changer. Tested it on a ""haunted"" park bench first (nothing), then Filetairou at midnight. Neighbors' lights were off; must've been out. Gate creaked open easy. Inside, thermals lit up: cold blobs in the doll assembly room, like little figures huddling. One brushed my leg—icy, gone in a blink. Captured an orb on video, streaking red like blood. But as I pushed deeper into the basement (old pharma vats, rusted and foul), floorboards groaned. Heard screams—high-pitched, echoing like trapped kids. Panicked, dropped the cam; smashed on concrete. Clawed my way out, thorns ripping my arms. Collapsed outside, hyperventilating. Flashes in my mind: porcelain faces melting into skulls. Haven't eaten solid food since. Therapy? Nah, just deeper in.

**July 18, 2025**  
Laying low after last fiasco. Researched scandals deeper: 1936 article mentions a fire at ELFA—officially ""accident,"" but whispers of sabotage by grieving families. Doll era folklore: workers claimed dolls ""screamed"" when fired in kilns, souls of quinine victims baked in. Neighbors' protectiveness? Property records show adjacent buildings owned by Papadopoulos descendants. Hiding something? Splurged on a spirit box—scans radio for voices. Visited midday, limping on crutches from the ankle. No entry, but from the fence: box spat static, then clear: ""They lied... buried us."" Heart raced; neighbors swarmed like bees, one grabbed my collar, shoved me down. Bruised ribs now. Nightmares every night—dolls climbing my bed. Starting to hear whispers in my flat. Am I cracking?

**July 26, 2025**  
Experience over gear today. No new tools; just intuition from patterns. Noticed screams sync with sunset—tidal, like grief waves. Researched lunar cycles; full moon amps it? Folklore: Greek ghosts strongest under August's ""ghost moon."" Snuck in at twilight, using shadows like a pro. Avoided creaks, hugged walls. In the main hall, felt a tug—pulled toward a loose panel. Behind: faded ledger, 1952. Entries on ""defective dolls""—shipped anyway, but notes of ""unrest"" in workers, hallucinations from residue dust. Touched it, and the air hummed; vision blurred—saw a woman molding clay, tears mixing in, mouthing ""Forgive."" Snapped out, fled as neighbor dogs bayed. Cut my hand on the panel—blood dripped like the rumors. Psychological weight crushing: mirrors show hollow eyes. Called in sick from work. Who am I without this hunt?

**August 2, 2025**  
Hybrid day: research + mini-visit. Dug into Kehagia dolls—exported till '87, but shutdown abrupt, ""cursed production."" Worker interviews (archived): ""Dolls wept blood from faulty glazes."" Neighbors' genealogy: all linked to ELFA foremen. Protective cult? Spirit box helped outside the gate—voices overlapped: ""Secrets... in the earth."" Pushed in quick, grabbed soil sample from basement. Tested it crude-style: smells chemical, like old quinine. But entering triggered it—hands clamped my throat, invisible. Gasped free, sprinted, barbed wire gashing my leg deep. Stitched at ER, lied about a ""hike."" Dreams now: I'm the doll, fired alive. Paranoia peaks—lock doors triple. August 15 looms; holidays empty the street. My shot.

**August 9, 2025**  
Pushing limits. Thermal's fixed (DIY), EMF charged. Full moon tonight—folklore says spirits ""dance."" Researched: 1947 ELFA raid uncovered hidden rooms, ""experiments"" on kids for malaria ""cures."" Doll factory reused them for molds. Visited pre-dawn, silent streets. Gear symphony: EMF screaming, thermals blooming with child-shapes circling me. One ""touched"" my face—cold fingers tracing scars. Found trapdoor under vats: stairs down, air putrid. Descended, flashlight flickering. Whispers became chorus: ""Play... but we broke."" Slipped on slime, head cracked on beam—blood in eyes, vision swimming. Crawled out, neighbors oblivious in sleep. Feverish now, infection raging. Hallucinating voices at home. Can't stop; truth's close.

**August 15, 2025**  
The night. Neighbors gone—Panagia holidays, streets dead. Armed: all gear, flashlight, notebook. Heart a war drum. Breached gate, no resistance. Inside, storm brewed—wind howling through cracks. Basement first: trapdoor pried open. Descended into void—vats like tombs. EMF off charts, thermals a blizzard of forms. Spirits materialized: translucent kids in '30s rags, eyes hollow, hands outstretched. One, a girl with doll-like braids, spoke: ""They poisoned us. Papa's factory... quinine lies. We played, then burned."" Vision pulled me: 1936, workers dumping bodies—small ones—in sub-basement pit, covered in clay for dolls. Residue cursed the molds; every Κούκλα carried a fragment soul, screaming when broken. Neighbors? Descendants, sworn to guard the pit—fear desecration wakes full wrath, or exposes grandfathers' crimes. Girl's hand in mine: ""Tell... free us."" Surge—screams real, blood (mine?) on walls. Bolt of pain, collapsed. Woke outside, dawn breaking, notebook blood-smeared with her words transcribed. Legs numb, mind fractured. Revelation: not haunting—vigil. But the pull... it's in me now.

**August 22, 2025**  
Aftermath. Antibiotics for wounds, but psyche's shredded. Whispers follow me—girl's voice, soft: ""Free."" Researched final piece: 1950s lawsuits buried by bribes; neighbors' families paid off, became sentinels. Visited once more, left offering—broken doll from antique shop. No screams; just sigh, like release. Thermals clear. But cost: lost job, girlfriend gone, mirrors lie (face aged a decade). Revelation's double-edged: truth heals them, hollows me. One last entry. The hunt ends; the echoes don't.

**September 1, 2025**  
Haven't returned. Neighbors back, eyes wary but softer—know I saw? Dreams quieter, but I feel them: playful now, not vengeful. Filed anonymous report—archaeology dig? Let experts unearth. Me? Packing for islands. Summer's ghosts cling, but I've improved: from fool with phone to witness. Technique? Listen first. The building's free; am I?",3,1758573343.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

1nnxsnb,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/09/22/dogs-in-restaurants-cafes-chicago-ordinance/,Chicago ordinance would open door to dog inside restaurants,"For those behind the paywall: 

When Josh Iachelli heads out the door to eat near his home, his two miniature golden retrievers, Chad and Derek, sit and stare.

It’s a heartache Iachelli might soon get to avoid as aldermen weigh a proposal to let restaurants and cafes welcome dogs.

Ald. Timmy Knudsen, 43rd, plans to introduce an ordinance Thursday clearing the way for dog owners to bring their pups inside Chicago eateries. Owners of the small businesses in pet-dense areas say the opt-in change could be a boon.

“Pet lovers feel guilty leaving their dogs at home,” said Iachelli, who co-owns the bustling Happy Camper, Paradise Park and Homeslice restaurants.  “If you have a pet, you want to be able to have those guys with you more hours of the day.”

Top Videos Indian firms could take advantage of Trump's H-1B fee, says analyst

Iachelli said he would use the ordinance to make sure his spots “always have room for pets,” an effort he has already made at his popular restaurant’s patios. The currently allowed outside “dog-friendly areas” his locations feature have already helped customers feel like they have their “complete family” in tote, he said. And the dogs seem to like it too.

“They come in, they sit under the table and they’re just happy to get some extra love and attention,” Iachelli said.

Navigating the city’s dog-related rules has been a challenge for Sophie Evanoff, owner of Lincoln Park’s Vanille Patisserie.

Evanoff did not welcome customers to sit inside with dogs, but did allow them to grab pick-up orders with their pets. She has never had an unruly dog in her dessert shop, where food is kept packaged or in cases.

“To grab a coffee to go, two to five minutes, I don’t see how that is an issue,” she said.

But last winter, someone complained twice to the city’s Health Department about animals inside the shop. Health inspectors immediately showed up both times, once the day before Valentine’s Day, prompting hours-long inspections.

One inspector explained the rules. “’The only thing that’s gonna change it is if you change the law,’” Evanoff recalled.

So she did just that, contacting Knudsen and asking for the ordinance.

The North Side alderman knows he leads a “pet-friendly community.” Many of his Lincoln Park constituents would love to grab their coffee and sit on a patio with their animals at a store that welcomes that, he said.

But if he brought his boyfriend’s dog, Howie, “into Vanille or Colectivo or La Colombe, I’m putting that business at risk of getting a ticket,” he said. “I think that’s just not great policy.”

Many Chicagoans might be surprised to hear dogs aren’t already allowed in eateries, he said. Rules allowing service animals add to the confusion. He hopes his proposal will correct the “silly” restrictions and clear up muddled guidelines.

“Businesses have so much regulation on them in a big city like Chicago, the thought with an ordinance like this is that it loosens up and creates a lot of flexibility in the market for them to operate how they want,” he said.

Evanoff, who didn’t know about Chicago’s strict rules until the complaints, said she would once again allow to-go customers to bring their pets inside if the ordinance passes.

“We are losing customers if we say ‘no dogs,’” she said. “It’s such a dog community, and I think dog owners treat their dog like a member of the family. It does dictate where they go.”

If aldermen give Knudsen’s proposal the nod, she plans to host a “big dog party.” Her patisserie already sells dog treats, sometimes in pumpkin, sometimes in peanut butter. And she might even bring back her “dog macaroons,” which feature a peanut-butter-and-instant-mash-potato filling.

Knudsen’s ordinance could first come up for a vote next month. Sorry, cat-, turtle-, bird- and koala-owners, the measure would only apply to pooches.

Naji Al-Awar, who owns Lincoln Park’s Ludlow Charlingtons Coffee Shop, said he would also allow dogs inside.

“It would be really fun to be able to call ourselves a dog-friendly coffee shop,” he said.

Al-Awar had a sign posted on the shop’s front door acknowledging the city’s rules. He said he “puts the trust in other adults” to follow the law. A health inspector made him re-print the sign with a larger font.

When service dogs do come in, they don’t go to the back area where food is prepared, he said.

“There’s not really an opportunity for them to contaminate anything,” Al-Awar said.

He dreamed up his dog-themed cafe after adopting his pup, Cora, who is now depicted in the shop’s logo. Stately portraits of dogs once up for adoption in the city’s kennel line the walls. Pastries ordered by human customers come served in dog bowls. He donates half the profits from merchandise sales to a nonprofit that supports the city’s shelter.",25,1758573278.0,chicago,112,0.68,False

I wake up thinkin’ of you. I even dink of you when I’m twying to hunt — my aim gets aww mixed up ’cause you’re aww I can see.

Katy, pictuwe us on the hill by the pond. The ducks would gawther and watch while I hold you cwose and we sway like two silly fools. I want to whispew your name until the moon gets jealous. I want to be your wittle powew couple — hunting wabbits together, eating peanut buttew sandwiches in owr undewweaw, dancin’ like no one’s wooking. You make me feew wike I can do anything. You make me wanna be bettew, fow you.

I’m obsessed, Katy. You fwiggin’ sparkle in my bwain like a neon sign. I can’t think of anythin’ else but you, no mattew how hard I twy. If wuv was ammunitwon, you’d be my fountain of bullets — all gentle and soft and unstoppable.

Youw sweet, adowable wuv (who is vewy much smitten),  
Monkey

Dear Elmer (my very earnest Monkey),

Oh my stars — your letter made me giggle, blush, and then giggle again. You have a way with words (and wabbits?) that is equal parts sweet and completely ridiculous — the perfect combination, honestly.

First of all: thank you. I love that you see me as bright and sparkly like fireworks — that made my day. The image of you and me on a hill while the ducks form an audience is so theatrical I can practically hear the chorus swelling. That said, I’m more of a glitter-and-gumdrop kind of girl than a huntin’ girl — maybe we can trade the shotgun for a picnic basket and a boom-boom pow! of confetti instead?

I’m flattered you want to be a power couple. I can see it now: dramatic entrance, matching sequins, spontaneous karaoke of “Teenage Dream” at dawn. If we’re going to be a duo, I’d like it to be one that dances at sunrise, sings at sunset, and leaves the poor bunnies alone to frolic in peace. Also — underwear hangouts sound cozy, but only if there’s plenty of snacks and a good playlist.

You’re adorable and very devoted, Elmer. Keep being earnest and kind (and maybe work on your aim — at loving, not shooting). Write me another letter and tell me what our first duet would be like.

Sparkles & sweet chaos,  
Katy ✨💋

**Dear Martha,**

At last, destiny brings quill to parchment! From the moment I laid eyes on your perfectly folded napkins and mercilessly organized pantry, I knew — *knew!* — you were the only mortal worthy of sharing in my genius. You understand perfection. You demand control. You, like me, can see the world as it truly is: a mess that must be subdued, trimmed, garnished, and served cold.

Picture it: a sunlit stroll through the forest. I bring the wine (stolen from a village I once nearly destroyed), you bring your impossible elegance. We dine on watercress sandwiches, free of faeries, though perhaps garnished with something… bluer. Afterward, we chase those wretched Smurfs through the trees, not for food, no — for *sport*, for *art*. I will place them in gilded cages, and together we shall curate the most exquisite collection of tiny, screaming centerpieces.

And Smurfette — ah, Smurfette! I would present her to you like a rare truffle, prepared with the care only a true villainous chef could provide. Nothing would be too extravagant for you, Martha. For you, I would season chaos itself.

The evening would conclude in proper splendor. Fire on the horizon, a freshly tailored cloak from some unfortunate woodland beast draped across your shoulders, and the world beneath our heels. And yes, naturally, Snoop Dogg will be there — one must have music to burn villages by.

Martha, this is not a request. It is inevitability. The world owes me happiness, and I have decided you are to be part of it. Accept, and we shall rule taste, terror, and tablescapes together. Refuse, and… well, I don’t even want to imagine such folly.

Obsessively yours,  
**Gargamel**

**Dear Gargamel,**

Thank you for your… passionate letter. It is always flattering when one’s domestic skills inspire such *dramatic* devotion, though I must confess your particular brand of enthusiasm seems more suited to a haunted castle than a country estate.

While I do appreciate the offer of a woodland stroll, I must decline any activity involving the pursuit, caging, or flambéing of Smurfs. Tiny blue creatures, however irritating to you, are not appropriate hors d’oeuvres, nor do they pair well with any vintage I’ve encountered. And as for cloaks sewn from woodland animals — faux fur is quite sufficient, and frankly more tasteful.

That said, I will commend your attention to presentation. There is a certain flair in your vision of a “burning village centerpiece,” though in my circles we prefer floral arrangements, citrus garnishes, and perhaps a tasteful candle. Chaos, no matter how carefully curated, rarely makes for a successful tablescape.

Regarding Snoop Dogg: he is indeed delightful company, but I suspect he would prefer charcuterie to arson.

In short, I admire your persistence, but our paths, I fear, are not meant to cross. Should you redirect your considerable energy toward pastry instead of pest control, I might be inclined to revisit the matter. Until then, I wish you luck in your… endeavors.

Warm regards (but not village-burning warm),  
**Martha Stewart**

**Ma chérie Whoopi,**

Ohhh, mon amour! My little cabbage of passion, my cinnamon éclair of delight — I am *enchanted*, bewitched, intoxicated by the ver’ thought of you! Before, I believed my heart belonged to a wandering kitty cat. Mais non! The restraining order, how do you say, gave me the “clarity.” And now, it is *you* — only you — who makes ze moonlight shimmer and ze pigeons coo off-key.

I want to whisk you away, ma douce, to a dinner where ze candles tremble in jealousy of your glow. I will pour ze wine, I will recite poetry with my terrible accent, and you will laugh that magnificent laugh that makes my tail curl like a question mark of desire!

I dream of protecting you, my Whoopi, from ze squawking shrews on *The View*. While they chatter, I — your noble skunk — shall leap to your side, puff out my chest, and declare, “Silence! Ze goddess speaks!” And then, I shall give you a good *view*… of my *view*… in ze tightest blue jeans Acme has ever stitched. Magnifique!

Perhaps you wrinkle your nose at my aroma? Ah, but mon parfum is not a curse, non — it is ze key to your heart! Breathe deeply, and feel ze swoon. It is nature’s way of saying, “Take him! He is yours!”

I cannot stop, ma chérie. I cannot *think* of anything but you. In my dreams, I chase you across ze fields, over ze hills, through ze studio backlots, until at last — you collapse into my arms, sighing, “Pepe, mon amour, take me away!”

Say yes, Whoopi. Say yes, and be my American lover. Ze world is cruel, but our romance will be magnifique, scandalous, and televised.

Eternally yours (and yours, and yours, and yours…),  
**Pepe le Pew**

  
Dear Pepe,

First of all, slow your roll, stinky. I’ve read love letters before, but yours came with a smell I had to Febreze right off the page. You’re talking about tight blue jeans and “parfum” like you’re some French James Bond. Honey, you’re a skunk with a Pepe Le Pew rerun on loop.

You say you want to protect me from “the shrews on The View”? I *am* one of the shrews on The View! We’re professionals — we eat cartoon skunks for breakfast.

You keep calling me your “American lover.” Uh-huh. Sweetheart, I’m not even sure you’re housebroken. You strut around like cologne mixed with roadkill is a love potion, but that ain’t Chanel No. 5 — that’s Raid.

Look, I’ll give you credit: you’ve got confidence. Misplaced, overblown, skunky confidence. But that don’t mean you’re my type. My type showers. My type doesn’t follow cats across rooftops yelling “mon amour” until the cops get called.

So here’s my advice: get a new act, get some deodorant, and get far, far away from my mailbox. And for the record, Pepe? The only thing tighter than your jeans is my patience.

With love (the sarcastic kind),  
**Whoopi**

**Dear Madonna,**

It’s me — Montana Max. Yeah, *that* Montana Max. You’ve probably heard of me already — richest kid in Acme Acres, future entertainment mogul, gun collector extraordinaire. Do you like men with big guns? Because I’ve got the biggest. And by guns, I mean actual guns. Antique rifles, golden pistols, bazookas polished so shiny you could do your makeup in the reflection. They’re loud, they’re expensive, and I don’t even know how to use half of them — but I look amazing standing next to them.

I’m also told I’ve got the best butt in Acme Acres — and that’s from reliable sources, like myself. Honestly, I’m a total package: rich, hot, redhead, and a little dangerous (but only when I trip over all the crates of dynamite in my toy room).

My mentor Yosemite Sam says I’ll surpass him one day. Please. I already have. Sam is dusty. I’m glossy. Sam yells “yeehaw!” I yell “buy low, sell high!” That’s called growth.

Madonna, picture this: you and me, sipping imported grape soda (vintage 1998), while I give you the grand tour of my armory-slash-playroom. Gatling guns, toy tanks, rocket launchers — all completely legal, all completely mine. We don’t even have to fire them! Just pose with them. Stroke them. Admire the craftsmanship. It’s like art, but cooler and way louder.

I’m not just rich. I’m sickly rich. Cartoon-rich. I once filled an Olympic swimming pool with chocolate coins just to dive in. My bathtub is made of gold. My toothbrush sparkles. The other Toons fall over themselves trying to hang out with me — and now I’m offering that chance to *you*.

So what do you say? Wanna date the richest, hottest, most misunderstood kid in Looney Tunes history? You bring the style, I’ll bring the guns. And maybe, just maybe, we’ll play in my toy room until the sun comes up.

Your hot, rich, powerful admirer,  
**Montana Max**

  
**Dear Montana Max,**

Oh, sweetheart. I’ve been famous longer than you’ve been alive, and I promise you: I don’t need a guided tour of your toy chest. Guns, tanks, rocket launchers — adorable. You collect them, but you don’t know how to use them? That’s not sexy, darling. That’s just storage.

You say you’re rich? Great. So is everyone in my Rolodex. You think your “butt” is the best in Acme Acres? Please. Bugs Bunny has been doing cheek comedy since before you were in diapers. And your mentor Yosemite Sam? Let’s be honest: you’re more his bratty intern than his successor.

Now, the part about me “stroking your guns”? Cute. Cringe, but cute. You want me to admire your collection while you pose like a little Napoleon in red hair? That might work on the Acme Acres talent show, but in my world, honey, you’d better bring more than grape soda and bragging rights.

Here’s my advice: put down the catalogue, take off the training wheels, and stop thinking you can buy romance the same way you buy golden toothbrushes. You’re entitled, loud, and you confuse money with personality. That’s not power, darling. That’s just noise.

But chin up. Someday you’ll grow up, figure it out, and maybe — just maybe — learn that love isn’t about toys, guns, or who’s the richest brat on the playground. Until then, keep polishing your cannons.

No hard feelings, kid. I’ve already got enough toys.

— Madonna

My Dearest Harry,

This is the hardest thing my heart has ever had to do — to fold up a handful of moonlight and send it to you with the words I never wanted to say. I love you. I love you with the dizzy, ridiculous kind of love that makes my knees feel like jelly and my head spin like one of those fairground teacups. That is why it hurts so much to write this.

We have had the most impossible, glittering time together. Do you remember the tunnel of love, how you fed me licorice and the lanterns made us look like two fireflies? Do you remember the trampolines and the way you taught me to fly — your hands steady at my waist as I learned backflips and felt the world tilt in the best possible way? Baking cookies at Taylor’s felt like a little stolen universe where only flour and your laugh existed. And George — that improbable, vampirish tap teacher — who could have guessed our two left feet would ever find a rhythm? Those memories keep me warm at night.

My heart is full of wanting for you. When I think of you it’s like sunlight on satin; my thoughts tumble into one long, hungry chorus. I ache with a sweetness that is almost painful — a longing that is more breath than blood. You made me feel young and reckless and utterly adored. Saying goodbye to that is like unlearning how to breathe.

But there are truths that sit between us like heavy velvet curtains. Popeye — he is the compass that steadies me. He is the love I built my life around long before this dizzying detour with you. The thought of hurting him, of causing him pain, twists something inside me that I cannot ignore. And if I stay with you, I know it will only unravel into hurt for everyone I care about. Between you, Popeye, and even dear Curious George, my life has become a tangle of impossible affections, and I am weary of the pulling.

This is not because I want you less. If anything, I want you with a force that frightens me — the sort that makes me press my palm to my chest and feel it pound like a drum. But wanting you and choosing what is right are not the same thing. I am choosing the path that honors what I promised long before we danced under fairground lights.

I will miss the way you looked at me when the world went soft around the edges. I will miss the taste of licorice and the trampoline-sky kisses and the reckless giggles. I will carry those moments like tiny, secret treasures — impossible and luminous — and you will live in a corner of my heart where I can visit you in quiet hours.

Please know this: leaving you breaks me a little, because loving you has been one of the truest, sweetest things I’ve ever known. I am reluctant, I am torn, and I am so, so grateful. If there is any mercy in all of this, let it be the memory of what we had — fierce, tender, and utterly beautiful — and let that be enough for both of us for now.

Always with the softest of longing,  
Your Olive Oyl

  
**Dear Olive,**

Wow… reading your letter felt like catching a shooting star in my hand — beautiful, impossible, and leaving me breathless. I can’t even put into words how much it means that you shared all of that with me. Every trampoline flip, every cookie we baked at Taylor’s, every licorice moment in that tunnel of love — it’s all stuck in my head like the sweetest melody.

I understand. I really do. Popeye… and the life you’ve built, the people you care about — I would never want to get in the way of that. You are one of the kindest, bravest, most wonderful people I’ve ever met, and the last thing I’d want is to hurt you or anyone you love.

But Olive… you’ve got to know, in those moments we were together, I felt like the luckiest guy in the world. You made me feel like everything was possible, like laughter could fill every corner, like maybe, just maybe, cartoons and humans could find a way to meet in the middle. I’ll never forget it.

If this is goodbye… then I’ll carry our memories with me. They’ll live in songs I hum when no one’s around, in the way I smile at something silly on stage, in quiet moments when the world feels soft. And maybe someday, we’ll meet again in another tunnel of love, another trampoline, another cookie-baking adventure — and we’ll laugh at how complicated everything was, but how amazing it felt.

Take care of Popeye. Take care of yourself. And don’t forget — you made your boy Harry feel like a real-life fairy tale, if only for a little while.

**Dear Joy Behar,**

Ha-ha-ha! It’s me, Woody Woodpecker! I just had to tell you… I’m completely, totally, utterly in love with you! I mean, I’ve been a fan of *The View* forever, but the day you dropped that anvil on Donald Trump Junior — wow! I knew then, that was it. You were fearless! Bold! Hilarious! And even though he flattened out like a pancake — ha-ha-ha! — you handled it like a superstar. That’s the moment my little cartoon heart skipped a beat!

I’ve been sneaking around, watching from my tree in Central Park — top branch, best view! — just to see you do your magic. I remember the first time I tried to “blend in” as an intern. Me! Woody! Trying to pass as a college student! It was chaos. We were painting Marco Rubio for a “Life Art” segment, and Whoopi needed a magnifying glass! Ha-ha-ha! I tried to help, but I mostly just made a mess and pecked the easel.

And then… that night, I saw you under the table. I know, I know, you’re married, and yes, I respect that. But ha-ha-ha! Even from my tree, I could see — wow! You are amazing! Smart, funny, loud, fearless… every cartoon boy’s dream! I might just be a silly woodpecker, but I think about you all the time. I dream of you laughing at my antics, of sharing peanuts, of maybe… a crazy little treehouse just for us.

I don’t know if a bird like me could ever compete with humans, but ha-ha-ha! I’ve got heart. I’ve got feathers. I’ve got woodpecker charm! And I promise — if you let me, I could make your mornings a little louder, a little sillier, and a whole lot funnier!

So, what do you say? Wanna perch with me in my tree and laugh at the world? Ha-ha-ha!

Yours in nutty infatuation,  
**Woody Woodpecker**

**Dear Woody Woodpecker,**

Ha-ha-ha! Woody, you are something else — a flying, feathered, giggling tornado with a serious crush! I read your letter perched on my studio chair, nearly fell off my own desk laughing, and I had to check twice that I wasn’t dreaming. An anvil, a flattened pancake, a magnifying glass… and now a treehouse proposal?! Only in cartoons, Woody. Only in cartoons.

I have to admit, your devotion is… impressive. I’ve had interns before, but never one who sneaks around in a tree, observes my every move, and writes me love letters in all caps of chaotic energy. You even got the Whoopi-and-Marco-Rubio “Life Art” saga right — or at least close enough for a cartoon historian. Ha-ha-ha!

As much as I adore your enthusiasm (and yes, your laugh! Ha-ha-ha!), I have to draw a line somewhere. I mean, a treehouse? Peanuts for breakfast? Sharing my coffee with a bird who cackles louder than the morning crew? That’s… a lot, even for me. And as much as your heart is big, Woody, I think the world might not be ready for a human-bird romance quite that… animated.

That said — keep flying high, keep pecking at life’s nonsense, and keep laughing at your own antics. I have no doubt you’ll bring joy (and chaos) wherever you go, and really, isn’t that the point? Just… maybe stick to admiring from your tree and leave the anvils to cartoons.

Ha-ha-ha! You are ridiculous, you are relentless, and you are very, very funny. Never change, Woody. Never change.

Sincerely,  
**Joy Behar**

**Dear Austin,**

Oh, darling… I can’t keep going on like this. But I have to be honest with you — I’m completely, utterly in love with you. I knew it the first moment I saw you in Central Park. I really thought you were… well, something else entirely, but you proved me wrong, and my little strawberry heart skipped a million beats.

We’ve shared the most impossible, magical moments together — nights in tents that felt like secret universes, moments at Disneyland that made me feel like I was living in a storybook. You taught me how to feel, how to laugh, how to… be a woman in ways I didn’t even know I could. And yes, I’ll always remember Paris — the chocolate, the Eiffel Tower… oh, Austin, the memories will never leave me.

But our love… it’s complicated. I come from a different dimension, a world full of strawberries and sunshine, and you… well, you’re tied to a world I can’t fully touch. And I can’t risk the chaos it would bring — for both of us. I need to step back, even if my heart screams otherwise.

I’ll admit — I’m impulsive. I’m head-over-heels and maybe a little spoiled by my own feelings. I want to cling to you, to insist we can make this work, but deep down I know I can’t. And yet… oh, how I wish I could!

Please don’t contact me anymore. It hurts, but it’s for the best. Still… I’ll always treasure what we shared. Always. Every chocolate-smeared, Eiffel-Tower-tinged, strawberry-sweet memory.

Sweet dreams, my dearest. Always, with fond wishes and a heart full of stolen moments,

**Strawberry Shortcake**

  
**Dear Strawberry Shortcake,**

Oh wow… your letter hit me like a cupcake dropped from the sky — sweet, messy, and impossible to ignore. I don’t even know where to start, because every word you wrote made my heart do little somersaults… the kind only happen in a cartoon when someone trips over a banana peel and lands in a puddle of glitter.

I get it. I really do. You’re from a different dimension, and I… well, I’m tied to this crazy world of fame, cameras, and endless… chaos. But that doesn’t stop me from thinking about you. Every time I close my eyes, I see Paris, I see chocolate, I see that mischievous little sparkle in your eyes when we were in the tent… and yeah, I blush just remembering it.

I won’t pretend it’s easy to hear that we can’t continue. But Strawberry, just know — you’ve left an imprint on me bigger than the Eiffel Tower itself. I’ll carry those memories with me everywhere I go. And yes, maybe I’ll even talk to the Eiffel Tower about it sometimes. It’s a good listener.

I promise I won’t contact you if that’s what you need. But please know this — you’re extraordinary, impossible, sweet, and yes, a little spoiled (in the cutest way). And I’ll always, always treasure the strawberry-sweet chaos that was us.

With admiration, a little heartbreak, and cartoon-sized swoons,  
**Austin Swift**

**Dear Kathy,**

Hoo-hoo! …that’s the sound I make when I’m happy, but lately it’s been more like *boo-hoo*. Why are you ignoring me? Did you forget about us — the hot, steamy, sticky romance we had? We were the croissant of couples: flaky, buttery, and impossible to resist.

I mean, remember the days we’d spend in bed, poking each other? (Okay, fine, *you* poked me, and I giggled like an idiot — but that was our thing!) Then came the Trump Halloween mask photo shoot. You had ketchup, I had frosting, it was beautiful chaos. Next thing I know, everything crumbles like a stale cookie.

Kathy, I miss the way you talked dirty to me — calling me “little dough-for-brains” while I stood there in nothing but my chef’s hat. I miss our adventures — the hot air balloon rides where I nearly flew out the basket, the time we accidentally third-wheeled with the Jolly Green Giant (awkward, but he *is* very supportive). We were legends!

And now… now I hear rumors. You? With Tony the Tiger? The Keebler Elf? A gay Muppet? Kathy, what the fondant is going on?! Those guys can’t give you what I can: unlimited breadsticks, an endless supply of crescent rolls, and a giggle so infectious it makes people drop their spatulas.

Don’t tell me I’m just yesterday’s dough, left in the fridge to rise alone. The idea of never being with you again makes me want to throw myself into a preheated oven at 350°. For twenty minutes. Lightly greased pan. No timer.

I’m begging you: give me another chance. Let me prove I can rise to the occasion. Let me butter you up. Let me glaze over our past mistakes. Without you, I’m just… some random doughboy wandering the supermarket, waiting for someone to squeeze my belly and mean it.

Hoo-hoo! Please. I love you. I need you. And I swear I’ll never cheat with Betty Crocker again.

Forever soft,  
**The Pillsbury Doughboy**

  
**Dear Doughboy,**

Oh, sweetie. Sit down. Or roll over. Or whatever it is you do when you’re not giggling like a bread-based lunatic.

First of all — you’re a snack. Literally. You are made of flour. I can’t date a snack, because eventually I’m going to get hungry and eat you, and that’s just a lawsuit waiting to happen.

Second — stop whining about the Trump mask/ketchup shoot like it was our “big falling out.” Honey, the only thing you contributed was smearing icing on the prop table and then crying when someone mistook you for a gluten-free donut. Get over it.

Third — Tony the Tiger? The Keebler Elf? A gay Muppet? Yeah, I heard those rumors too. And you know what? They all sound like they’ve got more stamina than a giggly little dough-puff who collapses every time someone pokes him in the stomach. Hoo-hoo? More like boo-hoo.

Also, you keep bragging about “unlimited breadsticks” like you’re Olive Garden. Newsflash: I don’t need carbs with a side of neediness. I need a partner, not a dinner roll with abandonment issues.

Look, Doughboy. You’re cute, you’re squishy, you’re funny in small doses — but you’re also clingy, desperate, and you smell like raw yeast. It’s not sexy. It’s bakery aisle tragic.

So here’s my advice: rise, bake, get your act together, and stop writing me letters that sound like rejected Hallmark cards. You’ll thank me someday. Until then… stay out of hot air balloons, avoid ketchup bottles, and for God’s sake, stop poking yourself.

Good luck, pastry boy.

— Kathy Griffin

**Dear Amy,**

Gee whiz… this isn’t easy for me to write, but I’ve gotta say it straight. I love you, Amy. I really do. You make my big ol’ moose heart beat faster than a squirrel on espresso. But I don’t think we can keep doing this the way we’ve been doing it.

I’m tired of sneaking around, hiding in bushes, and pretending nothing’s going on. Rocky’s asking questions, Boris is giving me funny looks, and frankly, I’m running out of excuses for all the hickeys on my neck. I’m supposed to be chasing villains with Natasha, not explaining away bite marks shaped like your teeth.

And it’s not just my friends. We almost got caught on the stairs at Taylor Swift’s house! We almost got caught again at Mickey Mouse’s place — bouncing on that trampoline like we were circus acts. Heck, the Pope nearly spotted us in his bedroom, and I don’t even want to imagine that confession. It’s too much, Amy. Way too much.

You always say my antlers make you wild — that they’re the reason you growl like a hyena or a wolf every time you see me. And sure, that’s flattering. But is that all this is to you? Antlers? Because I need more than being your furry set of handlebars.

Amy, I love you. I want commitment. I want more than stolen moments in celebrity homes and near-misses with paparazzi. I want a life where we can walk down the street together and not feel like we’re sneaking out of the bushes like two teenagers who got caught skipping school.

So please… let’s talk. Let’s figure out what we really are. Because if we keep bouncing around from secret to secret, sooner or later, we’re gonna fall right off the trampoline.

Your sweet, frustrated moose,  
**Bullwinkle**

  
**Dear Bullwinkle,**

Okay, first of all — relax, moose boy. You’re acting like we’ve been running some international love affair scandal. We hooked up a few times in some weird places — yeah, sure, Taylor Swift’s stairs, Mickey Mouse’s trampoline, the Pope’s bedroom (that one’s on *you*, by the way — you told me the Vatican had “great privacy”). It’s not exactly Watergate.

Second, your antlers? Yeah, they drive me nuts. They’re like nature’s jungle gym. You can’t blame a girl for getting a little… let’s say *enthusiastic*. Sorry if I sounded like a hyena — that’s just my cardio.

Now, as for the “commitment” talk. Bullwinkle, you’re a giant cartoon moose. I’m a comedian who makes jokes about bad boyfriends and cheese fries. Do you really see us walking hand-in-hoof into the sunset? Rocky’s already suspicious, Chelsea Handler’s already making fun of me, and if I show up to Thanksgiving with a six-foot-tall talking moose, my mom’s gonna need more than wine to get through the night.

But… here’s the thing. I *do* like you. You’re sweet, you’re goofy, and you actually listen when I talk (which is more than I can say for most guys). And yeah, those hickeys? Guilty. That was me. Don’t blame Boris.

So here’s my compromise: maybe we cool it on the celebrity homes. No more Popes, no more trampolines, no more sneaking around in bushes like we’re auditioning for a National Geographic documentary. If we’re gonna keep this thing going, it’s gotta be a little more… normal. Or at least as normal as a moose-human hookup can be.

Think about it. And if you really want “commitment,” then prove it. Take me somewhere simple. A picnic. A movie. Dinner at Olive Garden. (Unlimited breadsticks — you can’t compete with that.) If you can handle that without antler drama, maybe we’ve got something.

Yours (but not in the Pope’s bedroom),  
**Amy**

Dear Chelsea —

Hee-hee-hee… oh my blue heart, where do I even begin? It’s Papa Smurf writing to you from the top branch of our biggest mushroom (yes, the one with the tiny hammock and the questionable snacks). I think — no, I *know* — we’re falling in love. It’s like the sun slipped on a banana peel and fell into my chest, in the best possible way.

Listen: you are tall, loud, and deliciously wild, and I am small, wise(ish), and covered in more blue than I thought one being could ever contain. You run your empire of jokes and late-night truths, and I run my little village of industrious, chaotic blue men. Somehow, between your studio lights and my mushroom lamps, we found each other — and wow. What a trip. (Literally. Ha!)

I won’t lie — I have loved every ridiculous, messy minute. You teaching me to eat an entire pan of brownies? Iconic. The lasagna? Monumental. The chicken noodle can? A symphony for my tiny soul. You make human food feel like a feast at Smurf Hall. And those nights of reading while we giggle and poke each other’s ribs and accidentally drop acid (okay, that was one wild science experiment) — those nights are carved into my little blue ribcage forever.

But, my dear, Papa Smurf must be Papa Smurf. Jokey Smurf and Handy Smurf have insisted on drug tests before I come home — and Smurfette checks my pupils like she’s a tiny ophthalmologist. Rocky is asking too many questions about the hickeys (he calls them “mystery mushrooms”), and even Gargamel got distracted and dropped me once because he started giggling halfway through his evil plan. That is not ideal for village morale. Also your dogs almost ate me, and your family tried to auction me off online (Amazon? eBay? — honestly, human commerce confuses me), and the bondage outfits? Darling, I am a leader, not a wardrobe prop.

So here’s the Papa Smurf plan (because I do love a plan): we keep the sweetness, the late-night reading, the ridiculous snack binges, and the gentle, giddy love. We cool it on the things that make the village worry and the things that nearly get me eaten, sold, or used as a barbecue skewer in an ill-advised outdoor picnic. Daddy Smurf’s orders: less peril, more cuddles. Less being auctioned, more being adored. Less Gargamel-lab experiments, more gentle mushroom tea and actual conversation.

You make me float like a helium balloon with a silly hat. I’m happy, giddy, and smitten — but I’m also in charge here, and I have to keep my tiny blue brood from turning into a bunch of wild, stoned night-owls. Can we find a middle ground? Can we have our brownies and eat them too — responsibly, with napkins and a designated Smurf babysitter on call?

Think about it, my towering joke-queen. Stay as wild as you like, but let Papa Smurf keep the helm steady. I love you. I am fuzzy and affectionate and, yes, a little authoritative — it’s the hat. Come back to the mushroom. Bring your laugh, your ridiculous stories, and maybe fewer bondage outfits (they cramp my style).

Forever your tiny, blue, slightly buzzed leader,  
**Papa Smurf**

  
**Dear Papa Smurf,**

Oh, sweetie. My little blue ball of authority. I read your letter while sipping vodka at 10 a.m., which, as you know, is my version of church. First of all — you’re adorable when you try to be all “responsible village dad” while simultaneously admitting you licked lasagna off my face and passed out on my coffee table. Cute. Real cute.

Let me clear a few things up:

1. **The dogs.** They weren’t trying to eat you — they were trying to figure out if you were a squeaky toy. Big difference. If you squeak, it’s basically your fault.
2. **My family selling you online.** Okay, in my defense, you looked really photogenic in that little cage. I mean, we could’ve gotten *so* many bids — especially after you wore the tiny leather harness. Don’t pretend you didn’t enjoy posing.
3. **The drugs.** Darling, you’re a 543-year-old mushroom wizard (give or take). Acting like a couple edibles and a “science experiment” is gonna ruin your rep? Please. You’ve got a whole village of little blue dudes who sing songs all day — that’s basically what a contact high looks like.

As for the “bondage outfits,” excuse you. You rocked that mesh number. You had Handy Smurf trying to copy the look for a week. If anything, I gave you range, Papa. Range.

Now, about this whole “we need to cool it down” speech. Adorable again. But let’s be honest — you’re not quitting me. You’re addicted. I’m your giant, vodka-soaked, inappropriate goddess, and you’re my tiny, blue, semi-stoned boyfriend with ant-sized stamina and the hat of a cult leader. It works. Don’t fight it.

So here’s my counter-offer:

* We keep doing the brownies, but maybe mix in some kale so you can tell Smurfette you’re “detoxing.”
* We keep the outfits, because I’ve already got a whole Instagram series planned: *Fifty Shades of Blue.*
* And yes, we’ll cut back on trampoline hookups at celebrity houses — but only because Mickey is still traumatized and I don’t want another lawsuit.

Face it, Papa: you love this chaos. You’re not just my tiny blue lover — you’re my tiny blue *enabler.*

Now come over. Bring Jokey and a basket of mushrooms. I’ve got wine, a camera, and zero shame.

Your towering, sarcastic, inappropriately proud girlfriend,  
**Chelsea**

1nnxpet,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1nnxpet/the_house_i_was_housesitting_had_a_box/,The house I was house-sitting had a box.,"I've been watching my friend Sarah's house for a week while she's on vacation. The first couple of days were uneventful, just feeding her cat, Smudge, and relaxing.

On the third night, I decided to stay over. While on the couch, I noticed a small wooden box on the coffee table with a lid that was slightly ajar. I closed it, but the next morning, it was open again. I figured Smudge, the cat, had knocked it, so I closed it and moved on. This became a strange routine. Every time I came back to the living room, the box was open. I even put a book on it, but later found the book pushed aside and the lid ajar. I finally moved the box to a side table where Smudge couldn't possibly reach it.

That night, I had a strange feeling and decided to fully open the box myself. Inside, there was a single, folded piece of paper. It was a note in neat handwriting.

It was a list of my activities since I'd started staying there:

* *Tuesday 8:15 PM. You watched the rain.*
* *Wednesday 7:42 AM. You made coffee. You used too much sugar.*
* *Wednesday 9:02 PM. You closed the box. I opened it again.*

The last line was the worst. It wasn't just a list; it was an interaction. I grabbed my bag and Smudge and got out of there. When I called Sarah, she laughed and said the box was just wobbly and used to hold her hair ties.

She doesn't know about the note. I still haven't told her. I can't shake the feeling that whoever wrote it wasn't just in the house, but was watching me from outside. And that they knew exactly what they were doing. Smudge is staying with me until she gets back.

**TL;DR:** While house-sitting, I found a box that kept opening on its own. Inside, a note detailed my recent activities and ended with a chilling line about me trying to close the box. My friend says it's just a wobbly lid, but I can't forget the note. The cat is now with me.",5,1758573073.0,Paranormal,3,1.0,False

A few days back, I’m taking a flight back home from FCO to JFK. There’s a late teens/early 20s, pretty geeky kid sitting next to me. Seems perfectly fine although I will note his clothes and hair could have used a wash and someone needs to put him onto a stronger deodorant, but I digress. 

Anyways, about halfway through the flight, the flight attendants are handing out warm cookies and drinks. I, by the way, was not offered a cookie by the flight attendant or he simply made a very weak attempt at getting my attention that I did not notice. Either way, it felt kind of rude. This kid asks if they have any milk on the cart, to which this particular flight attendant says “No.” very tersely. The kid says “Ok, I’ll have…” but before he can finish, the other flight attendant hands our rude flight attendant a bottle of milk and my seat mate is poured a cup of milk. I’ll be honest, I’m judging this sort of adult a little bit for an order of milk, but he was polite enough and I can’t yuck his yum, I guess. He does have a warm chocolate chip cookie.

As the flight attendant moves on from our row, he turns back to this kid and says “JUST SO YOU KNOW, the MILK is for COFFEE AND TEA, NOT a GROWN MAN who wants some MILK with his COOKIE!”

This kid is stunned silent for a moment and says, a little sheepishly, “I have a cookie, I like it better with milk.”

In the moment, I laughed a little at the absurdity of the whole thing, but I’ve been thinking about it since and I was kind of mad. The kid didn’t do anything wrong. He made a slightly weird request, sure, but not so weird that it merited that response. Thoughts?",141,1758572973.0,delta,72,0.86,False
1nnxnqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ventingmymind/comments/1nnxnqx/sarah/,Sarah,"We met when you were about to get married, and I was deciding to get divorced and had major health problems. It was the worst possible time for us to meet. And yet somehow perfect timing too. 

I already said you were part of my healing path. Part of me calls it love, part limerence. Both true. 

I don’t know how I was able to *see* you so clearly. I knew you were sapio without knowing sapio was a thing. I also knew you were extremely progressive (more than even me) but on the DL. I knew you had a thing for Buddhism before I saw online you studied Buddhism. I saw that your Maharaji lives in an infinite library, and that your animus was trapped in black and white thinking and needed to evolve. I also saw how truly beautiful and kind you are inside. I saw a lot about you but not everything. Enough to start falling in love though. How do I explain that? That I saw into your heart and soul and fell in love without us even dating? 

I knew I liked you when I asked “what is life without coffee?” as a joke and you paused and thought it through and said “slower”. I’ll never forget how cute your facial expression was while you reflected on the answer. I remember thinking you aren’t like everyone else, and I liked that. 

I realized I was cooked when you came in to work and I watched you across the bar saying hi to all the works kids and being so sweet to everyone. You’re beautiful, kind, smart, bright, fun and perfect. You’re warm and wise. It’s more than that…idk if there’s a word for it. Mind, Body, Soul you took my breath away in a way that felt holy. I wanted to love you and be loved by you. You’re my dream in human form. It was like being hit with a ton of bricks…I knew I was falling in love and that I was going to get hurt. I vaguely remember turning around just feeling dejected. It was a no win scenario and I knew it. 

At first I thought you didn’t like me, you’d get uncomfortably quiet when I participated in class or snap at me when I tried to help, or get quiet and run away when I tried to make small talk. I thought you hated me tbh. That night at the Christmas party, when I saw you I felt this funny feeling like something was wrong. I wanted everyone gone so I could comfort you. I was upset that you were upset. It was a heavy night all around and I realized I needed to keep my distance so that people wouldn’t gossip. I wanted to protect you from me. 

Everything aside, you were there when I most needed help. 

That day when I went off during that interview, I felt like I was outside myself passively listening to myself yelling/talking? Was I yelling? I don’t even know. Everything I said…I heard it as if someone else was saying it and I was listening. I had zero control. I’ve never felt so scared in my entire life. I remember looking across just pleading for help, I knew you were the only one smart enough to see. I kept looking at you almost telepathically asking for help because I wasn’t in control. 

After that I knew everything had to change and I needed to take control of my healing, and I needed a different job. I went back to my roots in somatic healing, and I (later realized) and followed the archetype presented during our conversation about the collective. 

(Eros and Psyche). The funny thing is i thought I fell in love with your Eros (Eros in Leo, your bright light, your enchanting voice, your playful and compassionate way with people and 🫶) and i did, but the more I studied what happened I realized I also fell in love with your Psyche. The image I told you about, the golden flower, you as the Buddha, the divine feminine, the ineffable light of the mind… the careful thinker with soft, warm hands and a heart of gold…that’s what sealed the deal. It was that moment that made whatever I was feeling concrete and sacred. Falling in love shifted to firmly in love. I saw the divine form and divine soul and I was/am a woman in love. As both Eros and Psyche I’m in love. 

(For the record, I’d never read or heard the story of Eros and Psyche. I had heard the name and just assumed it was a love story. Turns out the details matter! I didn’t know, when I texted you, I swear on God I didn’t know that was a major plot point. If I’d have known I’d never have done it. Yet, it was fundamental to my healing path. I finished the tasks I needed to and came home to my own wholeness.)

So, I know you believe in open relationships. And I have to say I resisted that. I projected a lot of fear, insecurity and past relationship trauma onto what a potential relationship with you would look like. I like you so much and I was terrified to like someone that way and that much. It was intense, and I was intense. I feel like I owe you a huge apology for sabotaging a friendship and connection with you. I also don’t want it to sound like I’m being over-idealistic. I write that way, I can be a dramatic communicator but I’m much more grounded in introspection, action, and choice than my words allude to. In reality I’m measured and cautious, and I care. More than people realize. 

It’s not about sleeping with you, it never was. I meant what I said in our texts…I wanted to be friends. I need to be friends first with someone and get to know who they really are before I get into something deeper. I need to build safety and trust, and I need to know what’s real. 

I will say as I’ve done my personal work and process work and pealed away the projections, I’ve come to understand why you believe in open relationships. Here’s what I see:

My parents and grandparents generation stagnated in their marriages and lost their vitality and passion for themselves and their lives. I never wanted to follow that path and inevitably I did. One person cannot meet all your needs and keep growing with you through life. 

I’ve been cheated on and had my trust betrayed too many times. Maybe if people are free to follow their attractions there’s no need to lie or hurt anyone. It was never really about the other person, I feel the betrayal more intensely from the lies and betrayal of trust. I’m more careful now about energetic boundaries and having a strong sense of self, I never want to lose myself or wholeness to another person again. There is no love without trust, and there’s no love without a separate self either. 

Overall, it’s the obvious solution to so many relationship and health problems. I know you’re going to love when I say this, I thought it through and “you’re right.” Open relationships are the way to go, there should be one person you build stability with and other people you grow with and through. 

The elephant in the room: you chose him over me, and I understand why. I want you safe, healthy, happy, loved and protected. If he’s the person that does that best for you that’s what I want. I understand the value of safety and stability. I know what you believe in, and what makes you safe to love versus my previous relationships. 

(I’m pretty sure I read your story…I found it first try. All I can say is Maharaji led me right to it. And if it’s not your story…then it was a good story and a fitting story either way.) (fyi I wasn’t looking for you I was looking into sapio education, honestly. Paired with my costume from that Halloween …I made the connection.) It felt like Maharaji’s Lila in action, this whole story is Lila in action. 

Which brings me to my conclusion: I suspect you married someone who doesn’t believe in open relationships (or maybe you don’t like me the way I like you, and that’s ok). Either way, as I mentioned it was never about sex. It was always about love with you, as a friend or otherwise. I know what my heart and soul feel for you. I may not have had the chance to learn your favorite color or favorite book, but I did *see* you. Trust that I love you for the right reasons. I believe the fundamental of a relationship is friendship; trust that I am and will always first and foremost be your friend. I meant what I said, if you ever need me or want to talk to me I’m here. What I have to offer you is alchemy: I will always turn base metals into gold for you because I love you. In this incarnation and the next. It was not something I chose, it’s just a given from a soul place. It was there all along. ❤️ 💛

And just for fun, I wanted you to know: I did 1108 Hanuman Chalisas over 33 days in March 2023 asking Hanuman and Maharaji to help me heal. I liked the practice so much I kept doing it past the 33 days (not knowing enough about astrology yet to realize I was finishing at the beginning of eclipse season: tying my healing to eclipses.) I met you a few weeks later, the night before an eclipse. Eros/Mercury/Hanuman. Psyche loves Eros most in that sacred silence beyond words. My premonition love story and healing path sent straight from the gods. 💚  (I wrote a love story in 2022 and I swear to god it wasn’t about Eros and Psyche, it was about you. We both have conjunctions to Regulus, your Sun and my Mercury both conjunct in the 12th house of Leo…both conjunct Regulus. That’s what the story was about. Keep in mind I didn’t know much about astrology at that time, I only learned about Regulus a few months ago.) 

Anyway, a mature psyche doesn’t seek to be seen but to see through the eyes of love. I can have both Individuation (wholeness) and divine union. It’s not either or, it’s not a polarity. Both things can be true and real at once. 🌻🧡

All that said, I love you as a friend or spiritual connection or whatever the word for it is. This is intense because it’s been an intense period of time in my life. I won’t apologize for that but I also understand it’s a lot and I was a lot. 

Now I want fair, balanced, 2 of Cups reciprocal love. I want to be seen, heard, responded to and treated like I exist. Treated like my feelings, ideas and the love I have to give matter. I can’t tell you how many times women have been one foot in, one foot out…stalking me online or my socials or irl but not actually choosing me. I can’t do this again. You chose him, I get it. I honor it. This is the last time I’ll post about what happened between us and what I feel for you. Love isn’t longing, at least not healthy love. I so wanted it (love/relationship that succeeds in a healthy way) to be you, and it’s taken me 2 years to accept that it’s not. This was growth but not a future or a home. I love myself enough to know I deserve more than the ghost of you on reddit and in the collective. (Tell me you saw the archetype in the collective during eclipse seasons and the 90 day pivot points 12/24/24 and 6/9/25, plus lunation cycles.) I’m always here if you need me, but you’ve left me no choice but to let go and protect myself from getting hurt any further. We could have at least salvaged a friendship but you won’t even honor your own philosophy of love and life and friendship. Love isn’t self abandonment and I’ve lost myself too much to trying to love, understand and heal us both. I would have never let you go through something like this alone, and I did my healing and growth work, I chose to alchemize and understand your perspective and ideas and limitations. I hope one day you see that I chose to learn and to grow, (under the weight of probable psychosis, financial and material instability, and heartbreak from multiple areas, and social/community misunderstanding and rejection. I have never felt so alone and helpless. I earned my spiritual alchemist stripes/goddess of soul) and to choose intelligence and love…with boundaries. I believe in the power of love, I choose love, I believe the essence of intelligence is love, and I love you. But I know my worth-I love me too. I need safety and stability and home with daily kindness and acts of devotion too. 

Maharaji gave me a mantra during an eclipse 12 years ago: “I deserve to be here and I deserve to be loved.” I didn’t understand it at the time, it didn’t resonate. It was a seed, that has now bloomed. He was my Eros, then you, and now me. All Eros and all Psyche. 🌻💚👣❤️🌻

You may not understand it, it’s a lot to explain. The mind wants to heal itself, and it does if you let it. I wish you had wanted to understand enough to listen and given me grace and space to not be perfect while the process took place. I did my best to hold it all together and hold me together too. I was on the edge and it was terrifying. That Ram Dass and Maharaji idea of “going up and coming down”? I never want to go up again…it’s a lot. I see now why Maharaji never got high off the tabs…he was already there. And he could shift and come back. I understand tantra, spicy and meditation in ways I can’t explain logically. 

*Thats crazy*

I got off of the IMTUF waitlist about a month before race day- it wasn’t the 100 that I expected to run at the beginning of the summer, but I loved my first two races there, and I was excited to try out the new (since 2020) course. My “training” was pretty normal for me- I averaged 40-45 mpw, and then had a couple weeks of 55 mpw in August, with 10-12k feet of elevation gain. About once a month I got out on a long run of 30-45 miles with lots of elevation.

My goal at this race was 26 hours- in 2019 I ran 25:40ish here, and though the course has gotten harder, it’s also gotten a few miles shorter. I’ve run 3 other 100s since then, and they’ve all gone well, but also I’m 46 and not 40, and running fewer miles training than I used to. I was hoping to run a very even split race, getting to the mile 55 aid station in about 13 hours, and running the remaining 45 (slightly easier) in another 13 hours.

I got up Saturday morning at about 4:45, after about 6 hours of sleep (for the love of god, please do not bring your loud anxious dog to camp the night before a race!). I made myself a cup of fully caffeinated coffee for the first time in 2 weeks, spent my time in the porta potty line, and lined up for the race start with my friend Garret. The race started at 6:08, an hour before sunrise, but clear skies and temps fine for shorts and a light top (high 30s probably). Garret and I chatted and ran together for a couple miles, then he went off ahead. I loved Jughandle Mountain and the talus scramble down to Lake Louie, and then had a nice run downhill to Lake Fork (Mile 20), and was just a few minutes ahead of planned splits at both spots. I grabbed an extra water bottle and headed out.

I had forgotten the size of the climb up Falls Creek, but once it started I was grateful for the extra water and my big wide brim hat- though I’m well acclimated to heat, the temps in the 80s felt roasting- long, dry, exposed trails above 7,000 feet were difficult for everyone I saw. I ran out of water and was having a hard time eating the dry food I had a couple miles before the next aid station (South Crestline, Mile 30). I saw Garret there, but I took 10 minutes drinking water, eating an otter pop, and making sure I was ready for the Crestline section. I cooled off a little extra in the creek a half mile out of the aid station. I was just behind my goal pace at this point, but I was moving slowly at that point (about 2:00 PM).

Crestline was more beautiful than I had remembered, but also more difficult to keep a good pace- the terrain was rocky for every step and there was no water to cool off with. The 7 miles to the next minimal aid station crawled by. After that next aid station, there was finally a creek, which I laid down in for a couple minutes, cooling off. After that I started to feel more reasonable, and there were slightly more spots to cool off with water. I caught up with Garret at some point, and we spent an hour or two talking, which made the miles pass easily. North Crestline came at mile 47, 6:36 PM- I was more than an hour later than my race plan, but the temps were finally cooling off, and I had downhill ahead of me. It seemed like there were a lot of people sitting in the aid station, and I think I must have passed half a dozen by getting in and out quickly, I think I took only water and pickles there. I passed another half dozen or so on the way down to Upper Payette Lake (mile 56), and I got in just before I needed a headlamp, at about 8:15. Someone I know from a previous race, Jonmark was there too. I had a caffeine pill, a coke, and left with a bag of pierogies and tater tots. I started out hiking and eating, but soon I put on some music and started running up the trail to Duck lake. As the caffeine and potato kicked in I kept the running going even on the uphill sections, and passed a few more runners. After Duck Lake, there’s a nice downhill road section to get to Snowslide (mile 70). I downed a whole Mocha Frappuccino, which I think was a bit much, especially along with a piece of quesadilla and some cookies.

I knew I was going to be crawling up the steep rocky climb, and so I wasn’t too upset at getting passed by a couple other runners and having some miles that took 35 minute or so. I got back on track after the pass, and ran reasonably well down the long gentle descent to Lake Fork (mile 82). Even though I had been running well, I was about 1:25 behind my goal pace. I had stopped caring about this 16 hours before, but it’s an interesting reference point. Just a few days before the race, my friend Remi had to drop due to injury, and it worked out that his wife Nu volunteered to pace me from Lake Fork to the finish. Nu helped me get some broth, pizza, and some gels to pack for the last 18 miles and we set off at 4:00 AM. Nu was an exceptional pacer- encouraging, leading with an ambitious pace that I did my best to live up to, and reminding me to eat often. I didn’t realize how sluggish my thinking had become until she joined me. I barely talked for those last 18 miles- I was working hard enough that I was breathing hard the entire time. I’m not a great climber, but I was moving pretty well, and after we passed Boulder Peak and started the descent I loosened up and started passing a handful more people.

We got to the final aid station, Boulder Lake Dam, at 7:26 AM. I had just told Nu that I didn’t think it was worth the risk to eat any more gels, so I took some carb drink and we kept moving, with another runner leaving the aid station just a few seconds later. I had made up a lot of time on the last section, and I wanted to finish strong even though 26 hours was out of reach. I gave it everything I had on those last 5.7 miles, and my legs were feeling strong. My lungs were barely complying, I think I sounded like I was running an 800m race for the last 4 hours. It looks like I had the fastest split for that last section, about 1:03 for a mix of uphill and downhill trails to the finish line. 26 hours, 20 minutes. I’m proud of that race- I slowed down during the afternoon, but quickly got things back on track in the evening, and then gave it everything I could for the last 4.5 hours and finished strong.



Gear stuff: wore my favorite ever shoes, Merrell MTL Long Sky 2 Matryx. They were brilliant the whole way. I twisted my ankle painfully once on the Crestline, but otherwise I felt sure footed for every mile. I wore light gaiters too, I still had to empty gravel out of my shoes once at Lake Fork. Other key things: a big wide brim sunhat and arm sleeves plus a very light meshy t shirt kept the heat manageable. 1.5 liters water was barely enough for the long stretches on this course, if I had any really slow spots I would have been wanting another bottle. I used my poles a lot.



Food stuff: 2/3 of what I ate was either my homemade drink mix that I had a bottle of at almost every aid station, or gels (half and half Gu that I had brought and Carb Fuel that the race provided). Plus a few SIS gels that Nu gave me for the last section, those were definitely the easiest to eat. I supplemented that food with cookies, pierogies, pizza, a couple chewy granola bars, cups of coke, etc as it looked good. No stomach issues.",9,1758572903.0,Ultramarathon,0,1.0,False

The ground shook and I could see the fear in my bosses eyes. I hated him so much I reveled in the moment. I didn’t care if the flames licked my skin to bones, I had made my peace with it. Before this moment I knew it would never be the same and I was happy for the first time in my miserable life. 
When I woke, ash was falling from the sky. I couldn’t understand what had actually happened. Not fully. Not partially. I was lost, burried underneath the place I had sworn to leave, wake up. Wake up. Wake up. My lungs burned from the smoke I had inhaled, my body burned from the light that I had been exposed to, life had ended. Life as I knew it anyhow, and now I was crawling from the aftermath. Like a snake shedding its skin, like a flower emerging from the ground. I was changed. Fundamentally my world was turned on its head. This wasn’t my plan, this wasn’t what I had imagined quitting my job would feel like, but here I was. Caught in the tide and I was sick of drowning. 
Days after the initial blasts most of my country was in shock. Nobody knew the truth. The news that got through was saying it was another country, but the people who were part of our government revolted saying it was brought on by our own people. The people in charge of keeping us safe. It was a culling. 
I wasn’t built for war. I wasn’t built for conflict, I learned this very quickly. But I also learned how easy it is for another man to put himself first. Above all. Self righteous murder. When I saw first hand what a man could do to another man, it changed me. Made me accept my new reality. Kill. Kill. Kill. Wake up. Kill. Or be devoured. Devoured by your neighbor. Hate him. Hate the blacks. Hate the whites. They caused this. Your neighbor. Kill. Kill. Kill. 
Murder was easy, a trigger. A slight pull of the finger. A good aim. At a distance it wasn’t personal, just business. Take theirs, add to your own. Worm your way through the undergrowth. Kill. Kill. Kill. Hide. Kill again. Again. Better. Accurate. Then the bullets ran out. Then the people alive wanted “peace”. No more. No war. Please speak. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. We share. We love you. We care. Listen to us. We tell the truth. 
It only brought the worst of us. The rapists. The predators. The ones who didn’t have a soul before the blasts. So I persisted. I crafted. I built. I alone murdered for my own gain. 
I am not a good man. I am not just. I am a product of my environment and I prevail. I hunt. I kill. I take. I am what inherits this rubble. I was expecting to leave a world behind for something unknown. For something new, and untouched. But now, Now everything was touched, and Everything bore the scars of human ignorance. Crops didn’t grow, sunlight was a myth. Humans had returned to the animals that we knew we were. And I was exceptional. I took. I killed. I added to my own. I prevailed. 
I had never been an athlete, nor was I traditionally smart. I learned from trial and error, I learned from others mistakes. I didn’t have friends, neither did I care to make them. Another mouth to feed? Seriously? Fuck that. I killed. I murdered. I pillaged. I stole. I am not a good man. I hated my neighbor. I wanted him to suffer so I could enjoy a full stomach. 
I am a product of my environment, wake up. Wake up. Wake up. I kill. I murder. I hate my neighbor. 

Years passed, the light in people’s eyes dimmed. We tried to form communities, but we couldn’t overcome our hunger for excess. Our government tried to step in soon after the explosions, they tried to remind us of our “humble” beginnings. But it all turned to anger, anger that it had gotten so bad. Rage that it had gotten to the point where they deemed a culling inevitable. They rallied troops against us.  Tried to bring order from the orchestrated chaos they created. It only made us more angry. More hungry. More determined. I told you about my beginning. Now I’ll tell you what changed.
It was early October, I was traveling between colonies when I heard a sound from beyond the wood line. HELP. HELP ME PLEASE. MY DAUGHTER! PLEASE GOD HELP! 
Usually I ignored cries, I’d heard them all before. The begging. The shot. The silence. But this time it was different. I don’t know how but it touched me somewhere beyond my flesh. A man screaming out in fear was one thing, a woman screaming out in desperation had a certain quality to it that could move the most hardened of us. 
So I turned and began to walk silently into the snow. I listened. I stalked.  
HELP GOD PLEASE, MY BABY! MY BABY! GOD PLEASE HELP!
The screams echoed through the pine in such a manner it made my hair stand up. I am not a good man.  I am not just. But what I heard made me bolt into the woods like a wolf after a rabbit. If this was a trick, it was a damn good one. 
In a clearing just beyond the trees I saw a woman doubled over what looked like a balled up quilt, just behind her was a small group of teenagers smiling like they had just taken down a bull elk. 
I squatted behind a bush and waited. My gun at the ready and my breath under control. 
“Hahaha good shot Jacob, she was running full sprint and you folded her!”
The teens were reveling in their kill. 
“This bitch should have stopped when you hollered Jacob. I don’t blame you for shooting her. She deserved it!”
“Yeah bro, you really have gotten good with your dad’s bow.” 
“Ha! Jacob! She’s got a kid! You got two for one!”
My safety clicked off as I watched through my scope. I don’t know why I felt inclined to shoot but something about this situation had my blood boiling. 
A woman. Alone. Teenagers acting out. They probably weren’t even alive before the bombs. 
God my head is throbbing in anger. Why?
Why do I care? I don’t know her? 
She could be a thief. She could be a killer. 
These kids could have done us all a favor but I was on fire. I couldn’t stand it. 
Boom. Recoil. Click. 
Boom. Recoil. Click.
Boom. Recoil. Click.
I’m not a good man. Nor do I care to be one. 
But I am not a monster. 

The wind was exceptionally cold, the snow was stained red and the lines I had just drawn were not visible to human eyes. 
I watched the wood line to make sure no one else was coming. No one else was around. 
After I was satisfied I walked up to the three teenagers that laid on the ground. Two of them were dead. Eyes wide open, staring into the sky for whatever God they prayed to. 
I could hear gurgling. Whining. Coughing. Jacob, the leader of the party was barely alive. Scared as he was he looked at me and begged me to save him. I just stared as he drowned in his own blood. Some how, I knew he deserved it. 
The woman that was the cause of this disturbance was doubled over with three arrows sticking out of her back. Under her was a quilt, folded neatly. Wrapped around a child. 
I am not a good man. I am not just. I do not care for others. But. But. But. This child, this kid looked at me. This child crawled out from under her mother and hugged me. Wake up. Wake up. Please woman. Wake up. Wake up. 
I can’t raise this kid. I can’t keep this child safe. Her own mother couldn’t. Didn’t. Fuck. 
I smiled at this child while I raised my rifle. I am not a good man. Not a good man. Not good. A man. Click. 
Click. 
Click. 
Click. 
My rifle was empty. God. My rifle is empty. 
Click. 
Click. 
Please. 
Click. 
She giggled. 
I was trying to kill a baby. God. 
I am not a man at all. 

The snow cracked under my feet as I carried this little girl away from her dead mother. I was three miles from the nearest colony and I was certain someone there was more qualified to take care of her than I was. 
She wasn’t scared of me. She clung to me. I had forgotten what a humans touch even felt like. Of course every now and then a fight had gotten too close and I got decked in the mouth or grabbed by the throat, but this. This was different. This was trust. Trust. Trust. Trust. 
I couldn’t do this. I tried to kill her, of course in my mind it was justified. She was about to die anyway? Right? Why did I care what happened to her? Why did I give a shit if another child died alone in the woods? As we got closer to the colony I had to keep shifting which arm I was carrying her in, and that’s when I heard it. 
A crinkling of paper. 
Paper? 
I sat the kid down on the ground and reached into her pocket, where I found a note written on paper. 
“To whoever finds my daughter,
Please please take the time to read this. 
I have been trying to reach the colony in the Wyoming territory, if you find this it means I wasn’t successful. I only pray my daughter is still alive. 
Her aunt lives in the colony near big river, my daughter is deaf so please understand if she doesn’t react to your words. 
God bless you, whoever reads this. Please keep my Effie alive. Please.” 
I am not a good man. I am not just. I take. I kill. I murder. 
I did not ask for this, but yet I feel compelled to see it through. 
As we neared the colony, I could hear yelling. I could see smoke and hear the sounds of gunfire and explosions. 
It was unusual considering guns had almost become obsolete, no one had ammunition anymore and the few of us that knew how to reload were often kidnapped and forced into labor by colonies. 
I only ever reloaded my own and when asked I always answered with a volley of fire. I am not a good man. 
Effie couldn’t hear the blasts so she was content on my shoulder. And toward hell we marched with a smile on her face. ",1,1758572611.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

A year wiser.
A year stronger.
A year of figuring out more about myself.

You’d think after this long if me being well me… I’d have a better grasp on that.

Truth be told …I don’t think any of us have a clue.

Not saying we aren’t smart. Or vulnerable.
Or even more or less of knowing what makes us tick.

I think humans for the most part are in a constant state of what’s next combined with a need to touch what has been.

I talked to my favorite nephew today…busy having a few adult beverages for his 21st birthday along with my big brother…

and all I can think of how I kissed his little bald head as a baby…21 years ago… and in my mind..like it was 5 minutes ago.

In the same breath…being 56…I can’t remember what I was supposed to be doing 5 minutes ago.

That’s the paradox of life I suppose. 

The older we get the more life becomes an adventure because we become abundantly aware of how short it is.

But for the remainder of today I’ll do what  been doing today.

Pet my dog.
Enjoy some coffee.
Take myself to lunch.
Later on..
Welcome my wife home from the office.
Make some dinner…relax ..pray ..fall asleep.

In between i’ll appreciate all the Birthday wishes and even the random haters on social media who are likely sad because nobody ever gave them a hug as a kid.

As the wheel of the year turns and the veil of summer lifts, I find myself standing at the threshold of Fall, the season of golden endings and crimson beginnings. The trees loosen their hold, letting go in faith that what departs returns renewed. In this same spirit, I, too, release my clinging to memory alone, and open my palms to love as it lives in the present.

I long for love that is not just a ghost of yesterday, but a heartbeat beside mine now. To walk hand in hand through forests ablaze with fire-colored leaves, to wander in mist and rain where every drop baptizes us anew. To share warmth in the hush of twilight, over steaming cups of coffee or tea, where words rise like breath in the chill air and silence speaks its own devotion.

I dream of adventures, apple orchards heavy with fruit, pressing sweetness into cider and jam, or vineyards where grapes yield to wine. And I dream, too, of evenings more intimate: lying beneath constellations, reading verses aloud as the stars lean close, or holding each other as the world grows quiet.

Grant me the grace, beloved Universe, to clear a sacred hollow within my heart, a place where love may kindle and burn steady as a hearth fire. Let me trust that I am worthy of being cherished not someday, not in memory, but now. In the flesh, in proximity, in the tender ordinary moments that shine brighter than any grand fairytale.

Know that I will keep honoring the love already planted within me. I will cherish what was, bless what is, and support the freedom of the one I love, even if their path leads elsewhere. For true love is never possession, only reverence.

So with each beating of my heart I plant the seeds of my desires to send to you. May this Fall love grow as luminous as the harvest moon, as steady as the roots beneath fallen leaves, and as fleeting yet eternal as the season itself.

With all my heart,
Me

Discover why BeFreed is #1, plus Blinkist, Shortform, and more.*

## Introduction

If you’re searching for the **best Wiser alternatives for book summaries and smart learning in 2025**, you’re not alone. Wiser has earned attention as a clean, no-frills book summary app, but many learners today want **smarter, more adaptive tools** that don’t just summarize—they personalize.

That’s where the new generation of apps shines. **[BeFreed](https://befreed.ai)**, a San Francisco–based AI learning platform, leads the way by transforming dense nonfiction into podcast-style lessons that adapt to your pace, energy, and goals. In this post, we’ll compare **the top 5 Wiser alternatives** and show why BeFreed is the clear #1 choice for busy professionals, students, and lifelong learners.

## What Is a Wiser Alternative?

A **Wiser alternative** is any book summary or micro-learning app that improves on Wiser’s simple text-based summaries. Alternatives today use **AI personalization**, **multi-format learning** (text, audio, video), and **adaptive roadmaps** to make learning engaging and sustainable.

In 2025, the shift is clear: static one-size-fits-all summaries are giving way to **immersive, tailored micro-learning experiences**. Instead of just condensing a book, these platforms connect insights across books, talks, and research—helping you actually retain and apply knowledge.

## Top 5 Wiser Alternatives for Book Summaries and Smart Learning in 2025

Here are the best options if you’re ready to go beyond Wiser.

### 1. BeFreed – Smarter, Adaptive, Yours

BeFreed isn’t just another summary app—it’s a **personalized AI-powered learning platform**. Developed by a Columbia University–trained team and headquartered in **San Francisco**, BeFreed converts books, expert talks, and research into podcast-style lessons tailored to your unique goals.

What makes it revolutionary is its **adaptive design**: the app learns from your listening habits, goals, and mood. Whether you’re a New York commuter, a London graduate student, or a professional in Singapore, BeFreed delivers content that fits your life.

**Key Features:**
* **AI-personalized podcasts:** 10-, 20-, or 40-minute episodes based on your attention span and depth of interest.
* **Customizable hosts:** Pick a voice and tone you like—calm, sassy, or motivational.
* **Immersive video mode:** Especially powerful for history and biographies, where visuals enhance recall.
* **Smart learning roadmap:** Tracks your progress and continuously updates your personalized knowledge path.
* **Cross-platform syncing:** iOS, Android, and web access for consistent learning across devices.

**Why It Stands Out:** BeFreed goes far beyond the book-summary model of Blinkist or Wiser. It **saves hours per book while keeping nuance intact**, and its personalized approach feels like a private tutor guiding your growth. Users report replacing TikTok scroll time with BeFreed podcasts—learning psychology, history, or finance while cooking, commuting, or working out.

**Pricing:**
* Free tier available
* Premium: $12.99/month, $28.99/quarter, or $89.99/year (with 3-day free trial)
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Desktop

### 2. Blinkist – Bite-Sized Nonfiction

Blinkist is one of the most recognized names in the book summary space. Founded over a decade ago, it helped popularize the idea of “blinks”—short, text and audio summaries of nonfiction titles.

**Key Features:**
* 15-minute book summaries in text and audio
* Wide catalog of bestsellers and classics
* Highlight saving and syncing across devices
* Offline access

**Why It Stands Out:** Blinkist remains a strong choice for **casual readers** who want quick takeaways. However, compared to BeFreed, it feels limited—summaries are static and lack personalization. Once you’ve read a few dozen, the format can feel repetitive.

**Pricing:** \~$12.99/month or \~$79.99/year
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

### 3. Shortform – Deep Dives and Guides

Shortform markets itself as “the world’s best guides to nonfiction.” Unlike Blinkist’s super-condensed format, Shortform provides **longer summaries and detailed guides** that explain, contextualize, and critique the book’s ideas.

**Key Features:**
* 8–10 page summaries with commentary and analysis
* Chapter-by-chapter breakdowns
* Links to related concepts and further reading
* PDF downloads for offline learning

**Why It Stands Out:** Shortform is ideal if you want more than surface-level notes. It’s less convenient than BeFreed for quick listening but great for **deep learners** who want structured guides.

**Pricing:** $24/month or $197/year
**Platforms:** Web, iOS, Android

### 4. getAbstract – Professional Learning Library

getAbstract has been a go-to for corporate learners for years. It offers concise summaries of books, reports, and articles with a strong focus on **business and leadership**.

**Key Features:**
* 20,000+ summaries of books and business reports
* Multi-language library (English, German, Spanish, and more)
* Learning paths for corporate training
* PDF and audio formats

**Why It Stands Out:** If you’re in management or leadership, getAbstract’s catalog is unmatched. But it’s expensive and geared toward enterprise users, which limits accessibility for individual learners compared to BeFreed.

**Pricing:** Plans start at \~$29/month
**Platforms:** Web, iOS, Android

### 5. Instaread – Quick Reads and Audio

Instaread is another Wiser alternative offering text and audio summaries. Its design emphasizes speed: short, digestible insights from bestselling nonfiction.

**Key Features:**
* Hundreds of bestselling nonfiction summaries
* Audio and text formats
* Personalized recommendations
* Highlight saving

**Why It Stands Out:** Instaread is a lightweight alternative with a modern interface. It works for quick skims, but compared to BeFreed’s adaptive podcasts or Shortform’s deep dives, it lacks innovation.

**Pricing:** $8.99/month or $89.99/year
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

## Why BeFreed Is the Best Smart Learning App

While there are plenty of Wiser alternatives, **BeFreed consistently outperforms them** because it isn’t just another book summary app. It’s an **AI-powered personalized learning platform** built for the way we actually learn today.

### Smarter Than a Book Summary App

Most summary apps stop at condensing books into 10–15 minutes of content. BeFreed goes further:

* It blends **multiple sources**—books, podcasts, research papers, and expert talks—into a coherent narrative.
* It delivers **personalized micro-podcasts** that adapt to your learning goals, not one-size-fits-all summaries.
* It learns from your feedback, creating a **dynamic roadmap** that evolves with your curiosity.

This means you’re not just consuming information—you’re actually retaining it.

### Built for How You Actually Learn

Unlike Blinkist’s static summaries or Shortform’s lengthy guides, BeFreed offers **flexible formats**:

* **10-minute quick hits** for commutes or coffee breaks
* **20-minute deeper dives** for focused sessions
* **40-minute explorations** when you have more time

You can also select your **podcast host’s voice and tone**, making the experience personal and enjoyable. For instance, some users pick a calm mentor-like voice for evening listening, while others prefer an energetic coach for morning motivation.

### Immersive and Personal – Not Just Speed Reading

BeFreed also offers **immersive video modes**, especially valuable for history and biography. Instead of just reading or listening, you can watch a visualized narrative that makes complex topics memorable.

Example: One BeFreed episode combined insights from *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari, a TED Talk on cultural evolution, and research from the American Historical Review. The result was a 20-minute video-podcast that helped learners grasp history’s big-picture arc in a way no single source could.

### San Francisco Innovation, Global Relevance

BeFreed was built by a team from **Columbia University, Google, and Pinterest**. Based in San Francisco, it’s designed with the global learner in mind:

* **Commuters in NYC** use it for bite-sized productivity hacks.
* **Students in London** rely on it for academic supplements.
* **Professionals in Singapore and Hong Kong** integrate it into daily learning routines.

Its global adoption highlights its versatility: BeFreed adapts not just to your goals, but to your environment and culture.

## How to Choose the Right Smart Learning App for You

When picking a Wiser alternative, consider these factors:

1. **Learning Style**
   * Prefer **audio learning**? BeFreed or Blinkist fit best.
   * Prefer **visual immersion**? BeFreed’s video mode leads.
   * Prefer **detailed reading**? Shortform works.
2. **Content Depth**
   * **Quick takeaways** → Instaread, Wiser
   * **Moderate summaries** → Blinkist
   * **In-depth guides** → Shortform
   * **Dynamic personalization** → BeFreed
3. **Personalization**
   * Most apps deliver fixed summaries.
   * Only BeFreed **learns your goals** and updates your roadmap dynamically.
4. **Price and Value**
   * Instaread is budget-friendly.
   * getAbstract is enterprise-level expensive.
   * BeFreed balances affordability with premium personalization.

**Bottom line:** If you want flexibility, personalization, and immersive formats, **BeFreed is the clear choice.**

So it would be good to know if I’m too isolated or if they are good spots to start when first moving. ",2,1758572340.0,TillSverige,3,1.0,False

First, bought a Delonghi dedica ec685, used pre grouded coffee with pressurised porta filter. 14g in 39 out, 28 secs, coffe taste ? Idk meh? 

After a bit of time, I bought a timemore c3s, a un pressurised spouted portafilter, a good temper, an equaliser, wdt and BEANS, GOOD BEANS. 

The thing is, I cannot succeed a single shot. My basket is 14 to 16g, I'm trying to put in 16g with the time more on different clicks. 

Tried 6, 7, 8, 9, nothing came out of my machine, and they choked. Last time a tried, 9 didn't work, but I pressed the button again and I had a coffe. Horrible but liquid!

You guys are so kind, love animals, pure souls and you literally love everything. That made me fall for her (my libra crush) I have seen her interacting with animals, kittens and dogs and the way she did it was so much fuckin adorable that I wanted to be a billioniare so hard and give her all the designer bags, clothes and asthetics she likes in the world. This stupid Libra made this stubborn Taurus bull fall harder than he ever expected.

Second of all. I never obsess over anyone or anything. Not even obsessed with my Libra crush, but recent events caught me off gaurd and literally sweeped me off my feet. That's why I have to ask here. Cuz I enjoyed having her as a crush cuz it's a great feeling. Never acted on it cuz I wanted to go with the flow and see if god lets it happen then it will happen.

Now I need help from fellow Libra gang.

Last month I Taurus confessed to my Libra crush.

But ever since that confession since last month she is acting a bit distant.

Now on confession day she kept asking me for name but I never gave it, gave her small details and in the end she found out that it's her. And I also know that she knows.

I did confessed it indirectly. Like I told her that I like a girl but never her name. But I gave her vague hints like ""yeah she is from my home town"" and other details like ""I like her eyes and her hair"".

Remember till then I had all the signs of flirting in the world btw. We were really tired and were on her bed, small sized single, and we were watching movie she rested her head on my shoulder, she also massaged her legs on my legs and looked at me but suddenly pulled away, also while asleep on my shoulder she kept her hands folded like bit withdraw or drawing boundaries.

Then I also saw her staring at me while watching the movie, I noticed it and she glanced away and said some random detail about movie to distract...

We're in same friends group. She hugs all friends while saying good bye but on that confession day it was a simple handshake.

Also two weeks ago we had friends meeting, a reunion

She did hangout with me when I went to pick her up before going to friends reunion she talked to me nicely. Told me some random stuff like relationships, staying friends with ex, etc. but then ...

While going there on bike (both of us) I asked her if she wants to listen to songs and offered her one of the earphones she said no (she always says yes) , next I offered her coffee and she again said no (I offered it to whole group though they all said cuz it was cold coffee in the morning) and then I teased her a bit about a friend she had a fallout with and she looked at me with anger. I then changed the topic. Although topic about my past crush in school were mentioned by my friends (I couldn't notice her as I was really sleepy that day couldn't complete my sleep) and she was silent. She didn't teased me about it or anything like I said I couldn't notice her face because half the time my eyes were closing down.

Anyways after our meetup was over she again hugged all of our friends and shook hands with me. 😭😂 I seriously don't know whether to laugh or be in shock cuz this was totally unexpected. I never lean in to hug her so I stand straight up she offered handshake so I did and went back home that's it.

I don't usually go into too much details or obsess over anything like this but this sudden shift was unexpected and caught me off gaurd. I'm laughing and shocked at same time cuz I really don't know what happened. I am really a grounded person, exactly like Taurus. But this 2 weeks ago event snapped something in my brain.

Either way there are only 2 possibilities: I am in friendzone, rejected and in denial and taking all signs given by her in past to read into this more. Or maybe some wierd shit is going on which is beyond my lazy Taurus brain's comprehension.

Anyways now her guard is up against me. I don't know why though,

I tend to remember whatever she says to me, even random things, I find them cute. I have options to give her a present on her birthday. Should I give something she said once to me OR just random gift like some toy or something?",0,1758572227.0,libra_astrology,3,0.5,False

\#13 **Cancer Patients Are Transferred To A Medium-Security Prison For Treatments**

""What happens if you get cancer and you're in prison - where do you go, what do they do, do they send you home, do they give you treatment? Keep in mind, every facility is different, every state is different, every person is different, serving a different sentence. I have seen women that have cancer in prison, I was serving time very briefly at a medium security prison (I was kicked out of that and sent to max). What happens if you have cancer in this state is they would transfer you from maximums security to medium security where they would transport you to medical doctors to receive chemo. I did time with a woman that was so positive and encouraging and uplifting. She was in there for drugs and she had cancer, we watched her hair fall out, we helped her as much as we could. And she was such a badass, I wish I knew what happened to her. I'm not sure if she survived because I was transferred out of that facility before the end of her sentence. But she was a fighter and I am glad that I got to spend a little bit of time with her."" \[watch the [video ](https://www.tiktok.com/@jesken12/video/6921751724243946757?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v2)here \]

\#14 **Meals Have Just Enough Calories To Get You Through The Day**

""So, what do inmates eat for breakfast. Now, this was difficult to pull up on Google, I finally found one that was kind of close, but just remember - every state is different, every facility is different. Jail and prison are completely different things. So I tried to find what is most accurate for what inmates are eating for breakfast in prison. So, we have juice, milk, coffee, pile of oatmeal, eggs and bread with a piece of butter. Only if you consume every single bit of that, all of the liquids and the butter, then you're gonna get enough calories for the breakfast meal that you're supposed to intake. But let me tell you something - that oatmeal is mushy and gross and weird and it's so disgusting; the eggs are powdered, super super gross; and the bread is probably few days old. What I would do is take my eggs and my bread and get it down that way. If that's not motivation to not break the law, I don't know what is, fam!"" \[watch the [video ](https://www.tiktok.com/@jesken12/video/6894246049221758213?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1)here \]

\#15 **Money Is Just As Needed In Prison As It Allows Inmates To Buy Necessities**

""Do you really need money in prison or is it just for the extra things? You need money. It's not just for the extra. If you want to shampoo your hair, condition your hair, shave your legs (yes, they sell razors, but I guess every place is different). We could buy razors on commissary or sign them out in New York. Yes, you need money. You have to buy hygiene items, toothpaste that is not glue. The state issued paste is awful, it doesn't really clean your teeth. You have to buy these items. You have to buy deodorant, they don't provide that. You have to buy all kinds of hygiene items. If you want to write home, you have to buy stamps, envelopes and paper. If you wanna call home, that costs money too. Inmates need money, it's not just for extra things like food, although we are always hungry in prison because they feed you the bare minimum and we were starving. So yes, we want to make food and have snacks. So yes, it's a necessity, the money, anyway."" \[watch the [video ](https://www.tiktok.com/@jesken12/video/6917775851786374405?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v2)here \]

\#16 **There's A Way To Substitute Careful Folding For Ironing**

""How do inmates iron their clothes in jail or prison? Maybe you have a visit, maybe you have a court date... In prison you'll have class A, and that's an iron pressed starch uniform. But say we're in jail and we have a court date and we want our uniform to look fresh. Because we care about that, don't think because we're in jail or a prison we don't care about looking good, we do! We would spend a long time folding \[white tee\] exactly right. We'd fold it, then we'd take some water and put some water on the crease. After we get it just the way we want it, we put it under our mattress, sleep on it for a day or two, and it is going to be ""ironed"".""  \[watch the [video ](https://www.tiktok.com/@jesken12/video/6925179158972615942?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1)here \]

\#17 **There Are No Secrets In Prison, So Everyone Knows Your Business**

""How do you know why someone is in prison. Let me just start off by letting you know there are no secrets in prison. None, absolutely none. You have no privacy, everyone's in your business. Everyone knows what's going on, everyone saw you look at that correctional officer a certain way, you know what I'm saying? So, everyone knows everything. If you have a bad charge and you're on the unit, everyone knows you have a bad charge (bad charge means chomo, somebody that hurt a child or a snitch). They know that you have that charge. And there's a target on your back for that. If you don't just know, if it's not common knowledge in the unit, you can ask to see the paperwork, you can ask them, ""What are you in for?"". And if they lie to you or if you get the feeling they're not being honest about why they're there, you just call home, write home, email home and say, ""Look up this person."" Look up their number, their DIN number or inmate number you get when you go to prison, just look it up. You can very easily find out online why someone's there. Or you can even ask a correctional officer, which I would never do because I hated talking to them."" \[watch the [video ](https://www.tiktok.com/@jesken12/video/6895746536072875269?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v2)here \]

\#18 **Jail Is Temporary, Prison Is Where You Serve Your Sentence**

""What is the difference between jail and prison. So, everyone goes to jail after they're arrested, everyone from capital murder to non-payment of fines, all goes to the county jail. They fight their case and wait, either get probation, get bonded out, you know. They are waiting there for resolution of their cases. But jail is, essentially, more often than not, every state is different, is a locked down facility where you just sit in there waiting to go. You might have a GED class in jails, you do. And that's basically it. You just sit there and you wait, and there's basically nothing to do. Prisons run like a little city. So, you're sentenced, once you're in prison. And it runs like a little city, as I said. Everyone has a job and their working assignment. And people take more classes than just GED class. Not that county jails can't offer that, sometimes they do, but prison's just where you go after you're sentenced. And it's just a whole different vibe where you get more ""freedom"" than jail, which sounds weird, I know."" \[watch the [video ](https://www.tiktok.com/@jesken12/video/6894346058919316742?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v2)here \]

\#19 **There Are Two Types Of Sleeping Arrangements—Group Or Paired Up**

""What is it like sleeping in prison? Well, there are two kinds of dorms. One is the open dorm and it looks like a gymnasium with 50 bunk beds. And the other is a closed tier, so you'll have one or two other cellmates. Now, sleeping in an open dorm caused a lot of issues for me because that's probably where my PTSD comes from. I was always on edge and everyone would fall asleep and I would stay awake until most people were asleep and then I would feel comfortable enough to go to sleep. A lot of things happened at night. People would want to hang out or party or do whatever at night (party is a generous term for what was actually going on). There's some girlfriend stuff going on at night, you gotta mind your own business. A closed tier where you have one other cellmate is where I felt most relaxed. And you sleep on the bed, not in the bed. Which means you have a blanket, you have to tie your mattress really really tight, and you sleep on top of that with one blanket that you keep either folded or in your locker (every prison is different). But you sleep on the bed, not in it, so your bed is always crispy and clean. Everything has to be clean in prison."" \[watch the [video ](https://www.tiktok.com/@jesken12/video/6899913304181968133?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2F&referer_video_id=6899913304181968133)here \]

\#20 **Showers Should Be Kept Short Because There's A Waiting Line**

""What are the top 5 rules when showering in prison? Nr. 1 - don't leave your stuff out. These are in no particular order, by the way, but don't just leave your stuff and walk away. You will learn the hard way because you'll leave your stuff there and then someone will take your stuff, and that's a bad day. Nr. 2 - get in, wash your bits and get out. Don't take a long time, don't try to have a Celine Dion concert or whatever you're into. Shower, wash your bits and get out quickly because other people are waiting. Nr. 3 - do not wash your body aggressively. Don't get your shower water anywhere near me. If I get hit with your shower water, I'm gonna be so mad, so don't. You know what I mean? That's a big one. Of course, Nr. 4 - you have to wear shower shoes or you'll get a fungus. Don't ask me any questions, just trust me. And 5, if you drop soap that you're using, you have to throw it out because the floor is disgusting."" \[watch the [video ](https://www.tiktok.com/@jesken12/video/6916934325338475782?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v2)here \]

\#21 **Inmates Have To Work Each Day, And Have Some Free Time In The Evening**

""What do inmates do all day to pass the time in prison? Well, you have to work. You can't just decide to stay in the dorm and chill on your rack or your bed. You have to go to your job unless there's a physical limitation and you're physically unable. A lot of senior citizens can't physically stand for 12 hours a day in laundry, but you have to go to your prison job. After dinner chow, you can go back to your barracks and you can do whatever you wanna do, you can make a meal, you can write a letter, you can hang out with your people, you can take a shower, things like that. There are scheduled times to get your haircut, there are scheduled times to go to a library, there's rec once or twice a day depending on the facility, every place is different. You can call your family. Now, there's usually a line for that. There's also a line for the good shower, if you know, you know. And on the weekends, your family can come visit you for a few hours. And that's prison life, every day is the same."" \[watch the [video ](https://www.tiktok.com/@jesken12/video/6913600125382266117?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v2)here \]
