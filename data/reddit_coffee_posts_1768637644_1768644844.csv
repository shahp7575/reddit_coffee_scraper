**MY YEARS IN FLUX** by Mira Hoffman, Published by Moon River Publisher, Collection: Heroes of Our Times, Date: c. 211X

So, we were stuck. Marooned on Mars with zero way back to the *Lucky Luke* and no line to Earth. The ship probably got a distress signal out before the crash, but right now, we were basically ghosts to the rest of the world.

Captain Nadia Rhodes wasn't interested in a pity party—not while we were burning through precious oxygen. Our mission commander is basically made of titanium and coffee, and she doesn't do ""giving up.""

“Listen up,” she snapped, her voice echoing in my helmet. “Everyone’s alive, which is a start. Now, we inventory the wreckage. Kazumi, Kai—go through the storage and tell me what isn't junk. Mira, Silas—you’re with me. We need a roof over our heads before the sun drops.”

Just like that, I was part of the team. My official job title on the manifest was ""Content & Documentation Specialist""—meaning I was the fluxer meant to stream our triumphs to a billion followers back home. But with the comms array smashed into a million pieces, there was no one to ""flux"" to. My new job? Muscle. Basically, I was just a grunt.

We found the microfiber package labeled “Main Quarters” and thankfully it was intact and on top. Dr. Silas Varma, our lead scientist, and I found a nice flat place to put it. Silas usually spends his time looking at microbes under a microscope, but he was surprisingly handy with a cargo winch.

Behind us, Kazumi and Kai were already tearing into the storage containers like their lives depended on it—which, honestly, they did. Our chief engineer and our ace pilot were knee-deep in crates, scanning barcodes and checking seals to see what actually survived the impact.

""Keep moving, Mira,"" Silas muttered, wiping red dust off his visor. ""The temperature's going to dive in two hours, and I'd rather not be a popsicle when the fans back home finally see your footage.""

I checked my wrist-cam. The ""Offline"" light was a depressing shade of red, but I kept the record button pinned anyway. If we were going down, I was going to make sure someone, someday, saw how hard we fought back.

Nadia hauled a heavy-duty sled over to us, loaded down with a compressor and a couple of high-pressure air tanks. We spent the next thirty minutes on our hands and knees, obsessively checking every seal and inch of the microfiber skin for tears. If there was even one pinhole, this whole thing was just a really expensive body bag. Once we were sure it wasn't a death trap, we signaled Kazumi and Kai to drop the inventory and join us. It was time for the main event: the inflation and the external bracing.

The compressor kicked in with a low, vibrating hum that felt like a heartbeat. Watching that microfiber skin bloat and stretch was like watching a ghost come to life. While the habitat took shape, I was hauling the solar arrays—twenty sleek, heavy slabs of silicon that were our only ticket to a warm night. Kazumi was already wrestling with the exterior interface, her fingers flying as she slotted in the battery blocks. They were green-lit and fully juiced, enough to keep us going for a week as long as we didn't get greedy with the heaters.

Kai jumped in to help me pivot the panels one by one. We aligned them dead-north, making sure the micro-motors were primed to hunt the sun the second it cleared the horizon. We even double-checked the night-shrouds—the automatic silver covers that snap shut to protect the glass from the freezing cold or the sandpaper effect of a Martian dust storm. If those failed, we’d be sitting in a dark, silent tent by Tuesday.

While we were playing tetris with the solar slabs, Nadia and Silas were wrestling the airlock into position. This thing was a serious piece of tech—super advanced, zero-leak, and built like a vault—but it was a total bottleneck. It could only cycle two people at a time, and the ""empty"" cycle was a grueling twenty-minute wait while the pumps fought the Martian vacuum. The refill? That was the easy part—ten seconds of a massive *whoosh* and you’re inside. It’s basically the world's most high-stakes elevator, and right now, it was our only way into the one place on this planet that wasn't trying to kill us.

Stepping inside was the first time I'd felt my heart rate drop since the crash. It wasn't just a plastic bubble; the interior walls were lined with a soft, warm-toned fabric that made the place feel less like a lab and more like a home. We spent the rest of the day in a blur of motion, clicking the five living alcoves into place and getting the micro-kitchen online. By sunset, we even had the communal space set up with the monitors and the local server. It was loaded with enough entertainment vids to last us a decade, which felt like a weirdly grim insurance policy.

Nadia stood in the center of the communal area, her helmet finally off. She looked like she’d aged five years in five hours, but she managed a tired smile.

“Good work, everyone,” she said, her voice sounding small without the suit’s speakers. “Congratulations on a job well done. Now, let's get some warm food in us and survive our first night on Mars. Tomorrow, we start the real work.”

I thought I wouldn't be able to sleep with the excitement and all that, but ""tomorrow"" came in an instant. That’s what hard work does to you—it skips the loading screen.

Breakfast was fast, and then we hit the briefing. ""First priority is long-term survival,"" Nadia said, pacing the small communal space. ""What did we lose in the crash?""

“The good news? The shock absorbers and the landing rockets saved the shuttle's shell, so we've got the hardware,"" Kai said, leaning against a storage crate. ""The bad news? The engines are toast, and the high-gain comm unit was turned into a pancake.""

""Then we focus on the basics,"" Nadia decided. ""Food, water, oxygen. Once we're stable, we figure out how to phone home. Maybe they'll send a rescue op, maybe they won't, but we aren't waiting around to find out.""

Easier said than done. It took five years to build the *Lucky Luke*, and I knew for a fact there wasn't a backup ship even on the drawing board.

“I suggest we build a small temple to *'The True Path of the Void Hermit,'*” I joked, flashing a grin. Everyone actually laughed. Even in the middle of a disaster, everyone knew about the Hermit’s supposed miracles—though the Hermit himself probably wouldn't care if we were stranded on Pluto, let alone Mars.

The next few weeks were a blur of ""real work."" We scouted ice patches, hooked up the refineries for water and oxygen, and I got stuck with the most glamorous job of all: the insect farm. Turns out, my followers back home would've loved the ""Protein Queen"" content, but here, it was just me and a lot of crickets. Kai and I spent our extra hours on the vegetable plots, trying to grow enough greens to keep us—and the bugs—alive. I kept fluxing the whole thing, recording silly interviews with the crew to keep our spirits up.

Then the ""Routine"" hit. And on Mars, routine is just another word for ""trying not to lose your mind."" To keep the space-madness at bay, Nadia had us spend our evenings brainstorming the ultimate comeback story—how to actually talk to Earth again. Silas was the one who finally cracked the code.

""Look, we went full high-tech, and look where that got us,"" Silas said during one of our nightly huddles, giving us a tired smile. ""The digital array is fried. You can't repair a shattered quantum processor with a multi-tool. So, we’re going analog. Short range.""

“How does short range help?” Kai asked, skeptical. “The ship’s brain is fully digital.”

“The comm array is, yeah. But the scientific suite? That’s a different story,” Silas explained. “The ship is in auto-orbit, snapping high-res pics of the surface to see if anything changes.”

“We’re the change!” I interrupted, getting that old fluxer spark back.

“Exactly. It’ll detect the camp and beam the images back eventually. But it’s also listening for radio noise on every frequency. So, we build the most archaic radio device possible and send pulses. Three shorts, three longs, three shorts. Morse code. SOS. If that doesn't get the AI’s attention, I’m officially retiring to a crater.”

So, we all became ""Analog Ops"" specialists overnight. My job? Building the ""Antenna-Foil Monster."" I spent days crafting a massive three-meter antenna out of scrap metal and literal kitchen foil. It was a total monstrosity—looked like a giant's DIY science project gone wrong—and the emitter we hooked up to it was a frankenstein-beast of old wires and stone-age tech.

But when we finally flipped the switch, it felt like we were throwing a flare into the dark. We started sending our first message of hope into the stars, praying someone, or something, was listening.

Hey! I’m 21M from US on a graduation trip in southern China (Jan 21 to Feb 1 (very flexible starting/ending date and duration)). I just finished traveling to Japan with college friends, but I’m doing China trip after on my own since I’m the only one graduating a semester early — figured it’d be fun to find a buddy or small group to explore with.

Main goal is food + culture that’s authentic and regional — I’ve worked as an apprentice at bars and coffee shops in Chongqing and Yunnan on a previous China trip, so I love checking out local food scenes beyond tourist spots. Also down for sightseeing, wandering, and some clothes shopping.

I’m fluent in Mandarin (lived in China for 12 years growing up). My personality is easygoing, and haven’t locked in any plans yet, so I’m happy to plan together or help with bookings/tickets.

Budget: flexible, roughly ~$40 per meal per person (more or less) depending on what we’re trying. Hotel wise I usually don’t have high expectations as long as it has basic amenities and doesn’t have to be in the most popular areas since I know enough Chinese to get around easily

Don’t know if she’ll see this. Probably not.

First grade, we were seven when we met. Developed a crush on her in second or third grade. Thought I’d lost her forever when my family moved across the country after fifth grade. Eventually reconnected after a couple years, became inseparable. We were probably sixteen or seventeen when I finally admitted I had a crush on her, really liked her, she said she felt the same so we became long distance partners for years. She was the first person I ever came out to as trans, both times. I love her more than anything, more than myself, I could trust her with anything and I could tell her everything. We were each others first. We talked about me moving back across the country and getting married and living happily together forever. I really tried, I fucked up so much. When my parents found out I was trans and transitioning and effectively kicked me out, I wasn’t the one to tell her that I was moving somewhere else temporarily because my life was thrown into chaos and I couldn’t function. That’s where it started I guess? We reconciled, tried to make a new plan, I tried to stick to it, life happened, I tried to adapt. We were going to make fun of the new twisters movie together and I didn’t plan on watching it in theaters until the storm chasing community started raving about how you have to see it there at least once so I did, we broke up not long after that. I fucked up again there. I was very clear I was still working towards moving back and we could try again when we lived in the same city again. The election happened, I didn’t vote because I was misled about voter registration where I lived at the time, I’m not excusing that royal fuck up but I was in Tennessee, my vote literally wouldn’t have mattered, not defending that though. I threw myself into being extremely informed, I tried to grow from there, she didn’t like that, no more politics between us, I explained where I was at and that was that, no more political talk between us. My car breaks, I can’t afford to fix it and can’t do my side gig so I can’t afford the note anymore, I let it get repossessed because I thought that’s the only thing I could do (dumb I know), I’m still intent on moving back across the country, I just try to work and live while preparing to move, I’m so bad at that. A few months later and I get my chance, I get an apartment I can afford (barely), I make this whole plan to move, I tell her, she seemed excited and happy. Moving time comes, obviously that plan immediately exploded and I have a breakdown because I’m so stressed, anxious, and I’m moving out to be on my own for the first time ever, she called me while I was crying and I tried to explain, she said she can’t handle that then and hung up, we don’t really talk much until after I’m settled here. She allowed me to ship my stuff to her house because I trust her, we hang out, I stay over with her once, I get my stuff and I’m finally done moving, we keep talking occasionally but it gets less and less. I reach out now and then, we talk sparsely and never about anything too deep, at this point I was too scared of pushing too far so I was going to let her set her own pace. We stop talking, I keep sending reels and whatnot to say I’m still around and willing to talk, nothing. I tell her happy birthday at midnight like we had been doing for years, six hours to acknowledge, I tried to keep her updated on possible northern lights and she gets to see them, I say I wanted to call and say happy birthday at least over the phone, nothing. Thanksgiving, nothing. Try to hang out and celebrate her birthday somehow when things calmed down, had a whole fiasco with work, we get coffee and go shopping and have fun together, I think things were looking up, not much talking afterwards, even when I’d initiate and give times I’m available and that I’m happy to do whatever. She goes on a trip, asks me to “stalk” (just watch the flight happen on flight radar like I always do) her flight, we chat briefly and same deal on the way back but I had to work and her flight was early, I miss it because I was asleep, I apologize, nothing. Christmas, nothing. New years, nothing. I keep sending a reel a day just to say “I’m here if you want to talk” and nothing. I’m going to a protest so I break the rule, I tell her, offer to go together, say I’ll at least let her know I’m safe when possible (like I’d done previously), that’s when she finally acknowledges me. I’m not defending breaking that boundary, but that’s what it took to be acknowledged. Even the one time this year she’s said something to me first, there was no conversation after. I was still hoping for something. I guess I can let go. I fumbled the most important relationship in my life and I don’t even know what to think. Yeah it’s my fault, I know I’ve fucked up so much, I’m not defending any of that because I know I did bad. So now I’m alone on the other side of the country from anyone that regularly acknowledges my existence that isn’t from work. I don’t know what to do anymore, I don’t want to burden anyone with this, I don’t even know if we are still friends or not but I’m under the impression this was it and honestly that’s fair, I broke a boundary. 16 years…functionally my whole life. I don’t really remember life before first grade, so I’ve basically known her my whole life and had a crush/been attracted to/in love with not much less time than that…I don’t know what to do or think or say. I’m rambling to strangers on the internet semi-anonymously. This’ll probably get deleted, that’s fair. I just don’t know anymore, I’ve been working towards being here for so long and when it finally happens I fuck it all up and I’m alone. I’m not going to do anything, I’m not a danger to myself or others, but I just don’t know what to do anymore, I don’t have anything else, I know it’s me being dramatic but it genuinely feels like my life is over right now. 16 years and I fuck it all up…I’m alone in a country that is actively going through a genocide of my community, a country that’s fully mask off fascist, a country that is crumbling and basically guaranteed to crash like never before, what else is there? Sorry to be a massive drag, I don’t want sympathy or anything, you can just go on and forget about this, it’s really okay, I just couldn’t hold it in.",3,1768642822.0,actuallesbians,1,1.0,False

1qf91ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldjerking/comments/1qf91ep/ama_about_my_soft_scifi_genetically_engineered/,AMA about my soft Sci-Fi genetically engineered elf space empre,"Hello, this is my first post here on this subreddit and I want to share the result of one of my long time worldbuilding projects. Of course I won't lie the post is more bureaucracy design than Sci-Fi due to the scale of the whole thing. AMA

The following are the background synopsis for this lengthy project.

1. Overall structure of the empire

So the empire is called the Elf Empire and it is run by theocracy at the top and managed democracy at the middle and the bottom. The head of state is the High Pontiff who is also head of church, who is responsible for both defense and foreign affairs.

The government is elected via instant runoff voting Westminster system. The government has 3 levels. 1. Central Government, whose House of Representatives has 1000 seats and each seat represents a star sector. 2. Federal level government, which handles the internal affairs in each star sector. 3. Municipal level government, which is responsible for governance within each inhabited star system.

A star sector may include up to a few thousand to tens of thousands of inhabited star systems.

The pontiff controls the government via unelected department deputies and high level bureaucrats whose promotion requires her approval.

Society is highly advanced but still has currency. Currency is tied to the energy requirements input into matter replicator plus administrative cost and upkeep (the more heavy, large, or complex the structure the more expensive it will be). UBI is implemented but only enough for basic survival, luxury goods still require physical and intellectual labor.

2. The church

The church worships a god called ""The Architect,"" who is the creator of their species (the person actually exist and created them via heavy genetic modifications from humans with alien biotech).

The chruch has military force called the templars (internal affairs) and the inquisitors (external affairs).

3. Biology and physiology

The Elf gender ratio is fixed at 1 male to 4 females with polygynous family units with the same ratio for maximum societal stability.

Lifespan wise at the beginning of their design their natural lifespan is \~300 Earth years, but as technology advances their lifespan becomes extended greatly (1000 year lifespan achieved at Year 300, 3000 year lifespan achieved at Year 15,000 of Empire's calander of creation)

Elf male's height is around 150-160 cm with enhanced brain capabilities (think of 200 IQ humans equivalent) whose main role in society is to either maintain family cohesion (majority of them) and do part time work or work full time for intellectual jobs (such as science, philosophy, art, etc..)

Elf female's height is about 170-200 cm with enhanced body strength (think of 1.5x to 2x typical human male strength) and massively enlarged breasts, for appearance think of Gouden Leeuw from Azur lane but with ears that sweeps backwards instead of sideways.

4. Elvian culture and norms

Elves have 3 stages of adulthood. 1. Biological maturity: 18 years old 2. Legal maturity: 40 years old 3. Cultural maturity: 60 years old

Male elves are seen as the protected and female elves seen as the protector. Male elves defer to the primary or most influential wife for family decisions but the male elf's opinion or concern is respected.

Due to UBI, the elves favor goods that have intellectual work or actual physical work made by sapient beings. For example, a ranch grown beef or hand picked coffee beans from Earth would be tens to hundreds of times more expensive versus matter replicated ones despite them being identical in taste. Archeology and artifacts of extinct civilizations is highly sought after. Moreover with functional material scarcity solved, the main ""currency"" the Elves deal with and compete over is social status and interpersonal networks.

5. Empire's political structure with vassals

Essentially: paternalistic guidance and management. The empire has formed a union called the ""Universal Union"" and all space faring civilizations that can travel beyond the gravity well of their parent star needs to join. Primitive civilizations are left untouched and observed. For vassals, the main carrot is the interstellar and intergalactic trade via stargate networks the Elves manufacture and operate across the galaxies as well as the Elf's currencies which the union designate as the fiat currency for inter-civilization trade and empire's matter replicator use; the sticks are the trading barriers and black lists, the Elvian space force, and high level vassals' military enforcement.

The Union's highest authority is called the Universal Union Grand Senate (UUGS), which has 10,000 seats but set up so that the empire has \~67% supermajority. Vassals have seats but their seat counts depend on their technological levels. The union also stipulated the maximum number of star systems each civilization can inhabit and exploit for resources on the basis of their technology levels which is enforced by the empire. The union itself does not have any executive departments, the empire herself and trusted high tech level vassal civilizations does all of the enforcement.

UUGS terms and voting thresholds:

Terms: 20 years, no snap elections, no dissolution, vacancies filled by special elections.

UUGS Grand Speaker election: 50%+1 votes

Legal Quorum: 51% of non-vacant senators (discourages vassal protest walkouts)

Resolutions: 50%+1 votes (Speaker can cast tie breaking vote in the event of a tie which requires senator abstension or vacancies, ex: 4999+1 : 4999)

Bills: 60%

Expulsion of Senators: 67%

Amend Universal Union charter: 90% (vassals know that they may lose every time, but at least the fundamental rules don't get unilaterally changed)

6. Space geography and territories

The Elysium: a parallel universe created by the Elf Empire at Year 10,000 whose physics constant is ever so slightly different from the prime universe, and its high dimension topography and internal physics constant is controlled by the ""Genesis Engine"" which is in the empire's capital, this which makes the Elysium a fortress against unwelcomed outsiders

The Bootes Galaxy: a man-made spherical galaxy of 40,000 LY radius consists of 1 trillion stars, stars collected from galaxies from the perimiter of the Bootes Void.

The Bootes Shell: a man-made shell of stars around the Bootes Galaxy which is between 45,000 - 50,000 LY from the core of the Bootes galaxy, its stars were previously from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Clout (SMC)

The Milky Way Galaxy: pretty obvious here, 400 billion stars

The New Andromeda Galaxy (NAG): 400 billion stars, formerly from the Andromeda Galaxy of which 1/3 ended up here, 1/3 cannibalized to use as fuel and construction of the Ark which was built in Year 300-700, the remaining 1/3 was left in original place with high tech civilizations that refuses to leave and left to be consumed by the ""The Static.""

The Virgo Supercluster Galaxy (VSG): 400 billion stars, formerly stars collected on the outer rims of the Eridanus supervoid during Year 800-4700 during which the Ouroboros accelerator was constructed (2 million light years in radius, required 1 trillion stars to be converted into materials and fuel to fire in order to obtain the Space-Energy conversion formula, destroyed in the 5 year war in Year 4795-4800) and the VSG was the surplus stars which houses the unsuspecting civilizations caught during the star hunting.

The structure of the 4 galaxies:

Bootes Galaxy at the middle, the Milky Way, VSG, NAG all orbit the Bootes Galaxy at 2 million light year radius on the same plane each with 120 degree separation from the orbit axis plane.",2,1768642610.0,worldjerking,5,1.0,False

I'm  33F and in many ways behind my years. I can't cook well and my housekeeping skills are mediocre, I'm messy and the home can get very dirty because of mild mental health issues and bad self management. Sometimes I manage just to do the bare minimum to avoid getting sick, I keep my fridge clean, I wash the dishes, I change/wash the clothes, sheets and towels and I clean the bathroom. The rest is ignored.
I have a boyfriend 32M who knows all of this and doesn't care and I thought it was a win for me. Now I realized he's so understanding because he's worse. He's very tidy but he doesn't clean anything. Food is rotting in the fridge. He doesn't wash anything at all. He often invites me over and I'm in serious difficulty because I can't have a shower because I know there are not clean towels for me to use. I open the fridge and I see the infected food. I had to make myself a coffee in a glass because all cups have been dirty for weeks and I don't trust hand washing can sanitize them. There is no soap, I'm washing my hands with shampoo (which I bought). He keeps telling ""yeah yeah I'll do it"" when I tell him to do something. I can't criticise him because he's been in my house and saw all the dirty mess without any negative comments, it would be hypocritical of me but I'm starting to struggle here to meet my basic necessities. What can I do? I could start doing basic homekeeping for him but I don't want to become the main housekeeper (I have no ability neither wish) and I feel that if I start doing this stuff for him I'll become the classic wife-mother who does almost anything and nags the partner constantly about looking after his own ass. Life together looks nightmarish, in the best case I would become the housewife I don't want to become to, in the worst case we'll live in degrading conditions (I struggle myself with home cleaning like I said).

What can I do? I thought I may be focusing on myself about improving my own skills while I start avoid his house until he gets he need to start pulling his weight of living alone (lived with his mother until this summer). Talking with him looks very unpleasant and hypocritical of me. This doesn't look like a solution for the couple thought.",2,1768642548.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

1qf8x4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qf8x4t/hf_for_anna_forever/,"[HF] For Anna, Forever","The young American turned the page and took a sip of café con leche. 



The waitress, perhaps 45, wiped the table beside him and glanced over. 



‘Shakespeare,’ she said, ‘Romeo y Julieta.’ 



He nodded, looking up. ‘I’m sorry, my Spanish is a little rusty. You speak English?’ 



‘I can get by,’ she replied in an accent mangled by travel. 



‘American Jews,’ she continued, ‘they stop in Mar Del Plata on their way to Miramar.’ 



‘Miramar, would you recommend it?’



‘There is nowhere in South America I would not recommend for a young American. The local girls, they will love you.’ 



He smiled, neat, even white teeth, and looked across the bay. The deep blue water of the Atlantic lapped at the beach crowded with sun worshippers. 



Mar Del Plata had been a boomtown since the war. 



‘The way you say local girl,’ the young American continued, ‘you are not a local girl?’ 



‘No, and as you can see, nor am I a girl.’ She smiled. 



‘So where are you from?’ 



He put his bookmark in place and closed it. 



‘I’m European,’ she replied. 



‘Spanish?’ 



‘No,’ she hesitated, ‘Northern European. A lot of us came after the war when the continent was in ruins.’ 



Another patron came into the cafe. He ordered a cortado and sat at the counter with a copy of *Charin*. 



The day had that easy, mid-summer feel of the southern hemisphere. Outside on the pavement, old men in trilbys threw dice, a kid sat on a wall licking ice cream off his fingers, and a cat stretched itself out under a parasol. 



The waitress returned to the table. ‘And you, what province in the USA are you from?’ 



‘California. I’m a journalism major at USC. Class of 1955.’ 



‘And you go in for the politics?’ 



He shook his head; his hair (bleached blonde by the salt and sun) danced. ‘I’m what they call beat.’ 



‘Beat? You mean to hit in English?’ 



‘Sort of, but more like you know the beat of a drum in a jazz band.’ 



‘You know, as a young girl, I rather liked Peter Kreuder,’ she paused. ‘his popularity faded though.’ 



The young man found himself staring at the waitress. She was certainly not beautiful, and probably never had been. She had a rather flat, broad nose and square jaw. Her unnaturally dark hair was coarse and unkempt. Yet he still felt a kind of magnetic attraction. 



She was a waitress in a dusty old seaside cafe, but it was as if she did not belong there, as if a cosmic creator had haphazardly placed a great character actor into the background of a minor scene.



He took out a camera; it was a Kodak Colorsnap 35 gifted to him by his father at graduation. 



‘I’m doing a travelogue, collecting snippets along my way– I'd really like to take your picture.’ 



‘Well, I don’t know. Nobody has asked to take a picture of me for many years.’ 



But there was just something about that young American. From all the chaos and destruction of the last 50 years, he stood in stark contrast. There was light in his eyes. 



‘Of course,’ she said, ‘that would be fine.’ 



‘Swell,’ he beamed, ‘now if you stand over there beside the counter.’ 



…



After that, the two fell into even easier conversation. 



He did most of the talking, but she did not mind, even if it was naive. 



He was going to change the world, word by word, experience by experience; this was the American century.



‘You should come with me,’ he continued, ‘to Miramar.’ 



Disappear off to Miramar with a 21-year-old American? For a second, she felt giddy, intoxicated, and then she caught herself. 



She had had her youth– arguably wasted it– and she had responsibilities. 



‘It is a very nice offer,’ she replied, ‘but you see, I am married.’ 



The youth apologised, paid for his coffee, and shook her hand. 



‘I have a feeling you will be the central character of any book I write, and I will dedicate it to you… And I just realised I don't even know your name.’ 



She blushed at the first sentence and seemed strangely perturbed by the second. 



‘Thank you, and it’s Anna.’ 



‘For Anna, forever,’ he replied. 



She watched through the glass as he strolled into the early morning sunshine, a young man ready to conquer the world. 



…



The bicycle ride home filled her with weighty grief.



She and her husband lived in a cabin down a secluded farm track. It was bare, unadorned, inconspicuous. 



The front door creaked open. The waft of decay seeped out. 



On the table was a barely touched meal of leberkloesse.  



Her husband sat in the armchair in the corner with a blanket over his knees. His white hair was pulled into a side parting. 



‘Eva, is that you?’ His voice was weak, reedy. 



Spread all around him were maps, annotated so that demarcations between countries were barely legible. 



‘Yes, it’s me.’ 



‘I finally have it,’ he continued. 



Every day he ‘had it.’ She made her way to his study, and as she went, cleared the empty packets of Pervitin. 



‘You see, if we don’t invade Yugoslavia and Greece, and if we don’t divert the two panzer armies of Army Group Centre to Army Group North, there is not the delay in reaching Moscow.’ 



‘I see,’ she replied, but all she could really see was an old man speaking in the present tense because he’d gone insane. Still, she continued the charade for the sake of her sanity as much as his. 



‘A young man came into the kaffeeshop today, an American college student making his way to Miramar.’ 



Her husband jabbed at positions on the map. 



‘A fine young man, he even asked if he could take my picture for his book.’ 



The map fell to the floor, the man turned, and there was a fire in his eyes she had not seen for many years. In truth, it scared her. She had rather grown used to him being docile. 



‘You did what?’ 



‘I spoke to a young American.’ 



‘A picture?!’ 



‘Yes, for his book.’ 



Painfully, he rose to his feet. 



‘Damn foolish woman. Can’t you see what you’ve done? We’ll have to move immediately. Call the Bishop.’ 



‘Relax, darling, he was just a young American boy travelling. He even showed me his student I.D.’ 



‘A Zionist ruse! Mossad.’ But even as he said it, the conviction left his voice; his mind was snapping back to 1942. 



She reached for the bottle of oxycodone and filled a syringe. 



It was becoming harder and harder to get the drugs, which is why she’d taken the job as a waitress. 



It was a gamble, no doubt, but the fact of her existence was so outlandish nobody would believe it. 



‘They will have a parade for me in Red Square,’ he continued, ‘and we will take Lenin from his mausoleum and burn the swine in the street.’ 



‘Yes, Adi, yes.’ She eased him back to his chair and gently pricked him with the needle. 



His eyes closed. 



She went to the sink and cleared the food away, thinking of the young American. Of course, it had crossed her mind he was of Wiesenthal’s lot, and yet she had made peace with it. 



A part of her rather wished he were. Nobody could accuse her then of shirking her duty. 



She had had no life at all since leaving the Führer bunker in 1945. 



She closed her eyes, reached out a hand, and imagined stroking the boy’s face as the bus trundled to Miramar. 



And then she finished the washing up.

Not sure how I feel about Christianity. I feel alone.,"I was saved at a young age. I’ve dealt with a lot of church hurt. Including pastoral heretics, hypocrisy in leadership, out right verbal abuse and manipulation from a pastor at a great church that I ended up leaving because he was very angry and demeaning and not fit to be a pastor. My old church family completely stopped talking to me. I remember we all used to be so close. We would go out and evangelize every Friday night. We would go out to dinner all the time. We would take any and every moment to pray as a spiritual family together, we made everything about God and the Gospel.

That was prior to me experiencing serious trauma and spiritual abuse within the church and then also going through some serious trauma personally.

I left the church. Almost everyone I had contact with back then, those I would call brothers and sister’s spiritually are no longer in my life.

I’ve had some old friends (maybe two total) reach out to me and try to encourage me. Sharing a ton of Bible verses etc.

It just feels dull and dry. And meaningless. I feel lonely. I miss the feeling of belonging. I miss the feeling of having a true purpose in life. I miss the feeling of making a true difference in someone else’s life for a greater reason. An eternal reason. Something that will never die or fade. Deep connection and fellowship that wasn’t just shallow or surface level “well, see you next week” it was crying together, praying together, deep conversations, hard to speak about topics, hugging one another, reaching lost people with truth and love.

Now I just feel lost.

Sometimes I look at Christianity as a meaningless religion. Something people hold onto for false hope.

I stopped reading the Bible. I rarely attend church. Sermons feel staged and pointless. I only really go to see if I can connect with someone and have more than a shallow conversation. I don’t go to the same church anymore due to the distance and I know my relationships with everyone there wouldn’t be the same… it’s been years.

So I just pretty much have stopped going. I feel a void. I feel empty (spiritually) sometimes when people pray for me I just want them to stop.

I just want to go out and get drunk or go out and sit by myself at a coffee shop and not talk to anyone.

Because no one gets it. Only God does.

Christianity feels like a waste of time. Church feels so surface level and fake. I don’t even know how much of the Bible I agree with anymore. And I’ve lost all my friends. Everyone I loved. Everyone I was close to. They just left me.

PTSD kills me. Sometimes I can’t sleep at night. Hence me typing this at almost 4 in the morning.

I’m longing for deep connection. The kind I only get when I talk to God.

I don’t have this at church anymore. Not like I used to have. Sometimes when people bring up the Bible it just makes me annoyed. The Bible doesn’t have all the answers like some people say it does. And half of it is just stories of what other Christians went through. You know for inspiration. I know there can be great inspiration from it. But I don’t agree with everything in it anymore.

I just have my personal relationship with God. And all of my other spiritual beliefs. Many of them are more new age. And I find more comfort in those than in Christianity.

My lifestyle has been what some Christians would say is “ungodly” some reformed brethren might even call me a “reprobate”

But that’s my very point.

We aren’t supposed to judge someone as to whether they’re truly saved.

If someone talks the talk walks the walk perfectly and exemplifies “fruit” can quote scripture like they have the whole Bible memorized, what really makes them a Christian? I don’t believe them.

If someone goes out partying, sleeps around, but can talk about the deep things of God. I’m more inclined to believe they love God than the first person.

I don’t want to judge someone. But I also don’t believe a single soul that they are truly saved. Only God knows those who are His.

We really don’t.

This world is much too dark to take people at their word anymore.

I feel like a true believer would die for the faith. Here and now. Regardless of their sin. Regardless of what people have to say about their lifestyle. Regardless of their opinions on the Bible or organized religion, etc.

Because being truly saved is eternal. It’s otherworldly.

I know I don’t belong to this world.

That’s why I have started to hate church, hate surface level relationships, hate the Bible, hate Christianity itself. And all of its foolishness.

But I have found that with everything I have suffered in my life and all those who have left me. That I have loved God Himself even more because He has never walked away. He has carried me through the darkest valleys imaginable.

Never ending suffering. Immense pain.

Things that change you for the rest of your life.

So I can’t be the same person I was 4 years ago.

I’m not shallow, I’m not surface level, I’m not going to abandon someone once they stop going to church. I’m going to try to reach out. Ask them if they are okay. Tell them I’m there if they need anything. If possible I would visit them, bring them a meal, cry with them.

But we don’t see this in the church today.

How many churches send people out to visit their members and attendees in the hospital? How many of them bring meals to their house after sickness or the loss of a loved one. How many truly make deep impact in their direct church community? Not many. The majority don’t care enough about their own direct congregation.

Most churches don’t do this anymore. It’s typically just “oh hope to see you next week” and then you never hear from them again. If you don’t attend you’re no longer a part of their life. You no longer matter.

I’ll tell you what, I have always mattered to God.

But modern day western Christianity has failed.

If I just look at the book of acts. It shows you how far we are from what we could truly be.

That’s why I no longer follow Christianity, rarely attend church, and no longer read the Bible.

It’s all bogus.

A suffering people, is a faithful people.

Modern day Western Christianity has not seen suffering or persecution. Not like we see in some countries overseas.

And I think the church should rethink how they serve their people and their community.

We'd had two great dates but they were pretty standard - coffee shop, then a nice restaurant. I wanted to do something more memorable and interactive for date three, so I spent an evening creating a custom scavenger hunt around our city.

Here's what made it work:

**Personal touches**: Each clue referenced something from our previous conversations. One led to the bookstore where she mentioned finding her favorite novel. Another took us past the mural she'd sent me a photo of. It showed I was actually listening.

**Mix of indoor/outdoor**: Started at a coffee shop (safe, public), then moved through a park, ended at a cozy bar. Weather backup plan included indoor locations.

**Not too long**: 6 stops over about 90 minutes. Long enough to be an adventure, short enough that we weren't exhausted.

**The reveals**: Each location had a small clue envelope I'd hidden earlier that morning. Nothing expensive - just thoughtful. The final one was at a wine bar with a reservation.

She told me later it was one of the most thoughtful dates she'd ever been on. We're still together a year later, and she *still* brings it up.

The effort was maybe 2 hours of planning plus 30 minutes hiding clues that morning. Totally worth it compared to spending that time researching restaurants.

For anyone wanting to try this: I used Scavenge.rs to build it since I'm terrible at writing riddles. Took maybe 20 minutes to set up once I had my locations picked out. You could also just write clues on paper - the thought matters more than the format.

I am an international student in a smaller Italian student city. I would say I’m appealing, I always dress well, smell good, I’m funny once I become closer to someone, nice, with broad general knowledge. I travel, I’m up for anything normal, I do sports and volunteering, and I can talk about almost anything!!!

I’m having some trouble because I can’t seem to find any friends, and I feel like I really value closeness with people. People from uni don’t even want to go for a coffee, and they all seem very closed off. I also get a very bad feeling when I’m alone in person for most of the day. I still talk to my friends back home, but I’m the kind of person who can’t really be alone for an entire day. I would even prefer sitting with a friend back at home, each doing our own tasks we don't even have to talk, just a feeling that someone is there makes me feel good. I am not terrified of being alone, I have to do many things on my own but I just feel myself thinking too much then excessively and I feel not that good. 

I would go out with someone constantly, even just for a walk, or spend time at each other’s place, study together at the library — anything just not to be alone alot. And I don’t know if that’s a problem or not. Anyway, even when I do find some people, they often feel lethargic and don’t invest as much energy as I do. I ask if they want to go to field trips to bigger cities, or go watch a football match, movie,... whatever. Nothing expensive, it's just the lack of any life. And they're not doing anything on their own either except a few Italian students from the city who have their circles.

I would like to have a big social circle, but I don’t know how to build one, or even if I should. For example last night, Fridays and Saturdays are a big thing in the city where one third of the citizens are students, streets were crowded with groups and I felt like I was ALONE in that street, like everyone had someone... And I for a fact consider myself to push myself further and outside my comfort zone and that I'm social, but I'm obviously not doing something right!

I got pregnant a couple years ago and unfortunately lost our baby at 23 weeks pregnant. It was really hard on us and the grieving process was a lot and at that time my husband was really supportive and sensitive, we both we each others rocks. I got pregnant again (we planned both pregnancies) and now our son is 1 year old. Postpartum was really difficult for me and I have been seeing a therapist for almost a year now for all the difficult emotions I had been feeling. Through therapy I discovered that my difficulties stemmed from trauma from my first pregnancy and the feeling that my husband has been lacking in support after having our current son. 

I was doing most of the work with our son; cleaning bottles, pumping, bedtime routines, bathing, changing diapers, whilst also doing grocery shopping and cooking and daily cleaning as best I could. When I started work again it was just an additional thing to add to my plate. In therapy I worked really hard at learning how to communicate my needs for help to my husband in a way that he could best understand without getting defensive and without me having to nag every minute. It started with just being upfront and honest, and while it works, it sucked having to constantly tell him to help clean dishes or change diapers. Then I did an actual list of ways to help me that I put on the refrigerator which he said was an amazing idea, but he quickly forgot about. Throughout the year I’ve been very good at openly communicating my needs and demanding respect. He would snap at me and I’d have to correct him. For example, I woke up with out child in the morning, and he was still sleeping but it was already like 9am. I asked him to get coffee or make breakfast, or watch the baby so I could. He flipped me off and told me to let him “fucking sleep in”. He does not wake up in the middle of the night for the baby, I do 100% of the time. I walked away and ate without him, still making him a plate. Another time he cussed at me, and I told him to not talk to me like that and he tried to ignore me and act goofy. Lots of little acts of disrespect. 

This is where I snapped and have been seriously questioning everything. He had never been the “I’ll take care of you when you’re sick” kind of guy. But this week, our son had a 103 fever and I was working from home and taking care of him. It was devastating, he was screaming and crying and sleepy and wouldn’t eat. So I made a doctors appt for him for the following day. My husband got home from work and saw us in the couch, laying there. I was still in my pjs, dirty with baby snot and sweat, tired and defeated, I was getting sick now too (turned out he had something similar to RSV). I told him how difficult the day was and that our boy was seriously sick and how worried I was. After listening to me he asked “can I still go to my workout class”. I was dumbfounded. How could he look at us in our deteriorating state and still think to go? I just said yes. I was so tired of telling him what he could and couldn’t do and I wanted him to stay because he wanted to not because I told him he had to. He happily went and while he was gone, my son was screaming and crying in pain and wouldn’t eat or drink, and I didn’t even get to eat dinner either. My husband came home and I told him again about our son and he immediately just starts talking about his class and how he had fun. Then he asked if he should stay home from work the next day, j told him it was up to him and he said “well, i can’t take off work anyway but tell me how it goes tomorrow”. I was so hurt… then he leaves the room to go take a shower, without asking if we needed help or if maybe I wanted to take a shower first… i told him after I put or son to bed hours later that I was upset with him but that I would talk with him about it the next day.

The next day, my husband got a couple hours off early so he could help take us to our son’s doctor appointment, which was nice. He came home and demanded to know why I was upset with him and I told him why, I didn’t feel like our son and I were priority to him because of his choices last night. He instantly got upset and defensive. We drove silently to the doctors office. And when I got out of the car, I got our son out and my husband offered to hold him so I handed him over. Then I went to the other side of the car to get the diaper bag. I was wedged in between two cars pretty tight and I had my hand on the door handle. My husband then said he would get the diaper bag, but I told him I was already here with the door open and that I would get it. All of a sudden, in a super stern, angry voice, he said “move!“. I moved out of the way and he got the diaper bag, walking into the doctors office ahead of me with his diaper bag and her son and his arms. It made me feel like he was trying to make me look bad in front of everyone or something. he gave me the cold shoulder, the rest of the day and would say comments like “I know you HATE it when I ask but xyz…“ 

After I got her sent to bed again I asked why he was upset with me, but he said he wasn’t upset. I said you seem upset. And he said “why would you think I was upset “with a sarcastic tone. I listed the reason why, because of how he was talking to me all day. Basically, he said that he wasn’t a mind reader and that I’m a liar for telling him he could go to his workout class the night before. He said he didn’t understand why I was so upset. I told him that if he really doesn’t know why I’m upset then we need to go to couples counseling because I’ve been in therapy for a year and it’s not helping with our marriage. He got upset with that comment too. The next day he gave me the quote, told her again and didn’t talk to me.  Because my son was not sleeping through the night I had been awake for maybe three or four night straight and I was feeling sick and dizzy at work. My mom offered me to stay the night at her house so that she could stay up with my son in the middle of the night so that I can get rest finally. 

I feel guilty in a way accepting this night to have sleep for myself and leaving my husband at home. Ever since our fight, he has been stepping up and doing a bunch of work at home, like he usually does after a fight, but he does it with such attitude and anger that it’s almost not worth it to me. It just makes me kind of sad, I feel like my son and I deserved better this week… I would never think to go indulge in a hobby of mine if I saw my son and my husband sick on the couch, but he doesn’t see it that way.

So one day I went with a new doctor because the one that did the endoscopy was not helping me at all (please make your research and go with someone that does not only want your money🙄).

This new doctor is really helping me, my tongue is now pink I had a white tongue, it all started back in 2020 and until now I'm getting treatment so the process is slow but it's working plus I still have the ulcer. I hope it works for you. The medication she prescribes me is:

\-----------------------‐-------------‐------------------------------------------
""Flagenase""(antibiotic, Metronidazole) 400 mg:

a medication used to treat bacterial and parasitic infections in different parts of the body, like skin, mouth, reproductive system (e.g., bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis), and gastrointestinal tract. In English, it's simply known as Metronidazole, with the popular brand name Flagyl and is available in tablets or capsules. 

Every 12 hours for 28 days.
I had Giardia so they prescribed me this. I may have contracted it by eating something contaminated. Be careful where you eat.
-----------------------‐-------------‐------------------------------------------
""Flonorm"" (antibiotic Rifaximin) 200 mg:

Is known under brand names like Xifaxan, to treat bacterial infections in the gut, such as traveler's diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and hepatic encephalopathy. It's active ingredient is Rifaximin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that works locally in the intestines. 

Every 6 hours for 10 days
-----------------------‐-------------‐------------------------------------------
""Dexivant"" (Dexlansoprazol) 60 mg:

Is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used to treat acid reflux (GERD), heartburn, and erosive esophagitis by reducing stomach acid production. 

1 pill 30 minutes before lunch for 1 month.

\-----------------------‐-------------‐------------------------------------------

""Dimoflax"" (Clebopride & Simethicone) 200 mg:

1 pill 30 minutes before breakfast and 1 before dinner for 1 month.

\-----------------------‐-------------‐------------------------------------------

(Trimebutine) 200 mg:

1 pill 30 minutes before breakfast and 1 before dinner

\-----------------------‐-------------‐------------------------------------------

Unival (Sucralfate) :

treats and prevents stomach and duodenal ulcers by forming a protective, sticky barrier over the damaged lining, shielding it from acid and enzymes, which allows the ulcer to heal. It's a ""cytoprotective"" agent used for peptic ulcers, GERD, and sometimes stress ulcers, often taken on an empty stomach for best results, and comes as a tablet or liquid suspension. (The best part is that if you get the pills you put them in water, you let them dissolve and it has no flavor at all, just drink it)

1 pill before breakfast, 1 before lunch and 1 before dinner for 1 month.

I'm from Mexico so the name of the medicine may differ but I'll write the main components as well so you can get them.

""Fibiomet"" (Probiotics):

It is a 3-in-1 powder dietary supplement (usually orange-flavored) containing: 

•Fiber (Methylcellulose)

•Probiotics (Bacillus coagulans)

•Prebiotics (Galactomannans)    

no limit but drink it fast.

\-----------------------‐-------------‐------------------------------------------

Enterogermina (Probiotics):

Enterogermina is a popular probiotic medicine, containing the beneficial bacteria Bacillus clausii, used to treat and prevent diarrhea, restore gut flora balance disrupted by antibiotics or infections, and ease symptoms like indigestion (dyspepsia). It works by replenishing ""good"" bacteria in the intestine, supporting healthy digestion.

2 capsules per 10 ten days, the 1 per 2 months

----------------------‐-------------‐------------------------------------------

Picoprep (laxative)

Is a prescription powder used for bowel preparation, meaning it cleans out the colon before procedures like a colonoscopy, endoscopy, or certain X-rays by causing watery bowel movements. It contains sodium picosulfate, magnesiumoxide, and citric acid, which work together to stimulate the bowels to empty. 

like I said, this works by cleansing your gut, it gets out everything. I have a slow metabolism so the food gets stuck there sometimes, this helped me get it out, I saw pieces of food that I ate like 3 days prior to that, it means that it was stuck, it wasn't being digested and with this it finally got out :)

you have to start with all of the meds from above and after 5 days you have to stop eating just from one day so you can consume Picoprep, this 6th day liquids are only allowed, no solids so your gut gets cleansed, observe your stool and see if there's any undigested food, if you see pieces of food tell your doctor, it may be because of poor bowel movement and the muscles digestion is not happening. the 7th day you can start with solid food again, keep eating healthy, please, change your habits, is not your mouth, is your gut, help yourself or suffer the consecuences just like me. I was stupid enough to let this happen, I ate just junk and I get sik, wash your hands and eat from clean places.

1qf8bxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1qf8bxk/nothing_metaphorical/,Nothing metaphorical,"A coin flip

Eyes don’t lie—

they’re just mirrors turned inward,

showing me the same corpse I’ve buried every dawn.

Yesterday, I caught your memory

peeking from the rim of my coffee cup.

I swallowed. It burned all the way down.

Scalded my lungs into black lace,

left holes where breath used to crawl.

Love?

It started as a coin you flipped—

heads, I’m yours; tails, you still own the house.

You kept landing heads,

but the metal tasted like copper each time.

Turns out the trick wasn’t in the call;

it was the blade pressed under the sleeve.

I numbed myself alright—

poured three litres of poison down a throat

that already knew the shape of goodbye.

Passed out on bathroom tiles,

dreaming of your fingers interlaced in mine,

only to wake with nails dug in my own palms,

drawing half-moons that read ‘liar’ in dried blood.

Joy doesn’t come back.

It doesn’t circle like some loyal dog.

It was a moth you pinned to the wall—

wings still twitching,

dust flaking off like ash from a burnt prayer.

I used to warm my hands on that glow.

Now I warm them on radiator hum,

pretend the static is your voice

whispering my name before it breaks.

You ruined me—

say it louder, let the neighbours hear.

Ruined. Past tense,

like a church bell cracked in half

by its own ringing.

Still echoes, doesn’t it?

Every midnight chime

is a nail through the coffin lid.

And those tears you wore—

fine crystal, weren’t they?

Dropped them pretty,

one, two, three,

while the knife slid in slow enough

for me to count the ribs it kissed.

I felt you shake.

Thought it mercy.

It was just precision.

Now my days are rationed.

Each second’s a coin pressed into a tollbooth

that leads nowhere.

I won’t risk another toll for a road

you’ve already salted.

You keep the map.

I’ll keep the scar.

It itches sometimes.

That’s how I know it’s real.

That’s how I know

I haven’t gone mad—

only mute.

A throat full of unspoken winters

turning to ice that cuts when I breathe.

Go on, tell your next lover

the eyes never lie.

By then mine will be marbles

rolling across a graveyard floor,

looking for the skull they once belonged to.

[Metabo Drops Reviews](https://preview.redd.it/7c6oemfndvdg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3b54a10eabbee74bccf14a54bb2c0da3292b0bd)

# What is Metabo Drops?

**Metabo Drops** is a breakthrough liquid designed to transform any cup of coffee into a powerful metabolism-supporting Super Coffee. 

It is created using cutting-edge nutritional science, this tasteless, fast-dissolving formula works with your daily brew to help activate a smoother, more efficient metabolism. 

**By pairing coffee with targeted metabolic nutrients**, Metabo Drops aims to support natural fat-burning, steady all-day energy, reduced hunger, and improved overall well-being, without changing the taste or texture of your drink.

It is developed in response to new research on “**metabolic inequality**,” Metabo Drops helps address the common issue of slower inherited metabolism that affects millions of adults. 

The serum is engineered for rapid absorption, allowing its active components to work quickly and effectively.

# The Science Behind Metabo Drops

Metabo Drops is built on breakthrough research that uncovered a phenomenon known as **metabolic inequality**, where many individuals naturally inherit a slower, less efficient metabolism. 

Studies analyzing over 170 years of metabolic data confirmed that up to 80% of people may struggle with fat loss, not because of poor habits, but because their metabolism simply isn’t functioning optimally.

**Coffee already contains more than 1,000 bioactive compounds** that influence fat-burning, energy production, and metabolic health. 

However, these benefits can only be fully activated when paired with the right nutrients at the right moment. Metabo Drops was designed precisely for this purpose.

Its **serum-based formula** delivers key metabolic support rapidly and efficiently, enhancing the natural thermogenic and metabolic effects of coffee.

By improving metabolic efficiency, supporting steady energy, promoting fat-burning, and reducing appetite signals, Metabo Drops helps create the ideal internal environment for consistent weight management, all by enhancing your daily cup of coffee.

# Metabo Drops Ingredients

Metabo Drops combines a carefully crafted **blend of vitamins, minerals, and plant-based nutrients** to support metabolism, energy, and overall well-being.

**Vitamin D (Cholecalciferol) – 20 mcg**

* **Vitamin D** plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health, supporting immune function, and energy levels. It helps the body regulate various metabolic processes, including fat metabolism.

**Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine HCI) – 1 mg**

* Vitamin B6 is essential for energy production and efficient metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. It helps maintain healthy brain function and supports the production of neurotransmitters that regulate appetite.

**Vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin) – 5 mcg**

* Vitamin B12 is critical for maintaining energy, supporting red blood cell production, and promoting a healthy nervous system. It helps convert food into usable energy more efficiently.

**Chromium (Chromium Picolinate) – 20 mcg**

* Chromium helps regulate blood sugar and supports insulin sensitivity, which is essential for efficient metabolism. It aids in maintaining healthy energy levels and reducing sugar cravings.

**Proprietary Blend – 550 mg**

* **Green Tea Leaf Extract:** Green tea extract helps stimulate metabolism naturally, supporting fat-burning throughout the day. It contains antioxidants that improve overall cellular health and energy production.
* **Green Coffee Beans Extract:** Green Coffee Beans Extract is rich in bioactive compounds that enhance metabolic efficiency and support blood sugar balance. It helps the body burn fat more effectively while providing a gentle energy boost.
* **L-Carnitine:** L-Carnitine is an amino acid that helps transport fat into cells to be used as energy. This supports natural fat-burning and improves stamina during daily activities.
* **L-Theanine:** L-Theanine promotes calm, focused energy without causing jitters, balancing the stimulating effects of caffeine. It helps reduce appetite and cravings, supporting healthier eating habits.

I’m not trying to sell anything or pitch an idea. I’m in a learning phase and want to understand how small businesses operate in Riyadh, what sectors are growing, and what challenges people have faced while starting out.

If you’re a small business owner, entrepreneur, or someone familiar with the local business environment, I’d really appreciate any advice, insights, or even recommendations on where to learn more (events, communities, places to visit, etc.).

I will attend 8 social Meetup events and form genuine friendships with 5 new people, exchanging contact info and meeting them outside organized events.

# SECTION B: BREAKDOWN OF STEPS

Week 1: Join 5 Meetup groups (hiking, board games, book club), RSVP to 2 events this week, prepare conversation starters.  
Week 2: Attend 2 events, initiate conversations with 5+ people per event, exchange Instagram/phone numbers with 2-3 connections.  
Week 3: Attend 3 events (mix of groups), follow up with Week 2 contacts via text, invite 1-2 people for coffee outside Meetup.  
Week 4: Attend 3 final events, solidify 5 friendships through one-on-one hangouts, create group chat with new friends.

# SECTION C: EVIDENCE COLLECTION PLAN

1. Meetup event check-in screenshots — proof of attendance at 8 events with timestamps.
2. Text message screenshots (names redacted) — showing conversations and plans with 5 different people.
3. Photos from one-on-one meetups — 5 separate coffee/lunch meetings outside organized events (faces can be blurred for privacy).
4. Group chat screenshot — showing active conversation with minimum 5 new contacts.

# SECTION D: POTENTIAL OBSTACLES & SOLUTIONS

Social anxiety at events → attend with accountability partner first time, prepare 3 conversation starters, arrive 10 min early to ease in.  
People not following through → reach out to 10+ people to account for drop-off, don't take personally, focus on genuine connections.  
Schedule conflicts → prioritize weekends, block calendar every Saturday for Meetup events.

# SECTION E: PROGRESS UPDATE SCHEDULE

Updates twice weekly in comments: Days 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 25, 28. Share number of events attended, connections made, follow-up progress.

1qf7ugc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exvangelical/comments/1qf7ugc/i_miss_my_family/,I miss my family,"TLDR; Went for coffee, got had a good time until the preprogrammed preaching points. Made me miss my family more. 

I guess I just need a space to process. My spouse and I are both LGBTQ+, they are non binary and I’m a  trans woman, and because of that, we’ve had to cut off virtually all of our family members. 

They are all fully on board the bigotry train, refusing to use our names. Refusing to use our pronouns. The whole deal. My uncle has had pretty passive aggressive retaliation. My mom outed me to people I specifically told her not to tell and seems like she’s trying but constantly makes no effort after promises to do better, and is perpetually “grieving.” Like, fuck off with that. I’m right here, I’m not dead, and I’m trying to include you in the real me, that’s not a mask after decades of bottling up the truth and praying to god to make me normal. 

My parent in-laws just get loud and aggressive. My sister in-law recently texted my spouse over the holidays and the conversation turned to how she will only ever use my spouses dead name and call them “sister”. Then my spouse of course was pretty frustrated and their sister was texting about how she can explain. 

I was super mad and feeling confrontational and confident after a decade of deconstruction and two years of transition so I figured, you know what, I’ll bite. 

I took her out for coffee, and dammit I had a decent time catching up. Ironically because I’m very much a passing woman, my SIL was treating me like any other girl. Got excited about my new boots, loved my hair and earrings and she interacted with me so much more differently than when I was presenting as a man. And yet… when it came down to her “explanation” it was the same rehashed programming points of indoctrination of being told what to think about trans people. Like, girl, c’mon. You’re subconsciously seeing me as any other woman and treating me that way while still spitting transphobic nonsense. 

I’m a stone cold atheist at this point, having managed to deprogram and live free from religion. I told her point blank that I wasn’t trying to take her faith from her, but that there’s multiple denominations who love and accept LGBTQ+ people who don’t believe being queer as a sin. I pointed out there’s tens of thousands of denominations who believe differently and just as resolutely as she does, that they’re the ones who know The Truth(tm). Also pointing out that an all powerful god could easily keep his followers on the same page. 

Cue absolute blank stare. Like, all the gears stopped turning in that brain. Then she just went back to preprogrammed points. 

I reaffirmed our boundaries. That we’d love to see them again if they’d just not disrespect us and dehumanize us. Then went our separate ways. 

I know in some ways our family needs the exposure. Which is why I chanced with meeting with her. I’m the only trans woman she knows. But it’s still hard as fuck. 

In some ways I wish I hadn’t had a good time catching up with her. 

I just want my family back. I miss them so much and I’m hurting that the love they told me was unconditional had conditions all along. ",7,1768638168.0,Exvangelical,2,1.0,False

we all know exercise is good for us that's not news but what's actually happening inside your body when you don't move? it's not just about gaining weight or losing muscle tone. your body is literally eating itself from the inside out, and most people have no idea.

[dr. gabrielle lyon](https://drgabriellelyon.com/) (she's a functional medicine physician who specializes in muscle health) puts it bluntly: skeletal muscle isn't just for looking good or lifting heavy things. it's an endocrine organ. when you don't use it, your entire metabolic system starts to break down. and it happens faster than you'd think.

here's what i learned that made me get off my ass 

**your muscles are your metabolic currency**

most people think fat is the problem. turns out, it's actually muscle loss that fucks everything up. when you're sedentary, you lose muscle mass. and when you lose muscle, you lose your body's ability to process glucose effectively. this leads to insulin resistance, which is basically the gateway to type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cognitive decline, and a bunch of other shit you don't want.

source forever strong by dr. gabrielle lyon. she's trained at washington university and the nutritional science initiative. this book completely changed how i think about fitness. it's not about cardio or being skinny. it's about muscle being your longevity organ. insanely good read that will make you question everything you think you know about health and aging.

**your brain literally shrinks**

lack of movement impacts your hippocampus, the part of your brain responsible for memory and learning. exercise triggers the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is basically miracle-gro for your neurons. without it, your cognitive function declines. you become foggier, slower, more anxious.

dr. john ratey talks about this extensively in his research at harvard medical school. movement isn't optional for brain health. it's required. people who exercise regularly have better memory, faster processing speed, and lower rates of depression and anxiety.

check out ""spark: the revolutionary new science of exercise and the brain"" by john ratey. he's an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at harvard. this book breaks down exactly how exercise rewires your brain chemistry. best neuroscience book i've ever read on this topic.

**you're aging faster**

sedentary behavior accelerates cellular aging. there's actual research showing that people who sit for prolonged periods have shorter telomeres (the protective caps on chromosomes that indicate biological age). you could be 30 but have the cells of a 45 year old.

movement triggers autophagy, which is your body's cellular cleanup process. it clears out damaged cells and regenerates new ones. when you don't move, this process slows down. garbage accumulates. inflammation increases. you age faster.

**your mental health tanks**

this one hit me hard. exercise is as effective as SSRIs for treating mild to moderate depression. the research is clear on this. when you move, you increase dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, all the neurotransmitters that antidepressants try to modulate artificially.

but here's the kicker: you don't need to become a gym rat. dr. lyon recommends just 30 minutes of resistance training 3-4 times per week. that's it. you don't need to run marathons or do crossfit. just move heavy things consistently.

**practical starting point**

if you're completely sedentary, start stupidly small. 10 pushups in the morning. a 15 minute walk after dinner. 20 bodyweight squats while your coffee brews. the goal isn't intensity at first. it's consistency.

the ash app is actually solid for building exercise habits if you need accountability. it gives you daily check-ins and helps you track patterns without being annoying about it.

[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI learning app from Columbia grads and former Google engineers that pulls from research papers, expert talks, and books to create personalized audio learning plans. you can ask it to teach you anything, like building better fitness habits or understanding exercise science, and it generates a custom podcast tailored to your goals. the depth control is useful, you can do a quick 10-minute overview or go deep with a 40 minute session full of examples and context. it also has this virtual coach avatar you can chat with about your specific struggles, and it'll adjust your learning plan based on that. turns high-quality knowledge sources into something you can actually absorb during your commute or workout. makes it easier to learn the why behind these habits instead of just going through the motions.

**the system makes it worse**

modern life is designed to keep you sitting. desk jobs, long commutes, streaming services, food delivery. everything is optimized for convenience, which means minimal movement. your body wasn't designed for this. you have the same physiology as humans from 10,000 years ago who walked miles daily and used their muscles to survive.

the mismatch between your biology and your lifestyle is literally killing you. but the good news is you can fix it. your body responds incredibly fast to resistance training. within weeks, you'll see improvements in insulin sensitivity, mood, sleep quality, and energy levels.

listen to the peter attia podcast where he interviews Gabrielle lyon. they go deep on muscle centric medicine and why prioritizing muscle health is the best longevity strategy. completely changed my perspective on what ""fitness"" actually means.

you don't need permission to start. you don't need perfect conditions or expensive equipment. you just need to move your body with intention a few times per week. that's the baseline for being a functional human in 2025.",1,1768637849.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False
1qf7r7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qf7r7r/ill_never_go_near_that_farm_true_horror_story/,I'll Never Go Near That Farm - True Horror Story,"**My brother swore it was real.**

**Not like** ***urban legend*** **real, or** ***some kid in your class told you his cousin did it once*** **real. He swore it with that older-brother confidence that makes your brain go soft around the edges and accept anything as truth.**

**“Cows sleep standing up,” he told me, tossing a baseball into his glove like he was explaining gravity. “You walk up quiet. You push. They tip over. It’s hilarious.”**

**“Wouldn’t they wake up?” I asked.**

**He snorted. “You’ve never been around a cow. They’re dumb.”**

**That was in the summer before eighth grade, when I was thirteen and the world still had borders. The border of the yard light. The border of the last house on Maple. The border of the gravel road that ran past the river and into the cornfields where your parents didn’t want you after dark.**

**This was also before you could argue with a fact by pulling a glowing rectangle out of your pocket.**

**If my brother said it, if the older kids at the pool said it, if you saw it in some half-watched movie on cable late at night, then it lived in the same category as Bigfoot and quicksand: maybe fake, maybe not, but definitely worth testing when you had time, a bike, and a summer night that felt endless.**

**I’d lived in Larkspur, Kansas my whole life. Not the fancy Larkspur you see on postcards. Ours was a small town with a grain elevator you could see from almost anywhere, a water tower with peeling paint, and a single diner that smelled like fryer grease no matter how many times they “deep cleaned.” We had one stoplight. We had a high school that doubled as a tornado shelter. We had a cemetery that sat on a hill like it was watching us.**

**And we had farms.**

**Farms ringed us the way darkness rings a campfire. You could ride ten minutes out and be surrounded by corn that grew taller than your head, soybeans that shimmered like fish scales when the wind hit them right, and pastureland fenced off with barbed wire that hummed when you touched it.**

**That summer, cow tipping became the question that wouldn’t leave my mind. I asked my parents once at dinner—careful, casual, like I was asking what time it was.**

**My mom gave me a look over her iced tea. “Where did you hear that?”**

**“Nowhere,” I lied. “Just… heard.”**

**Dad’s fork paused halfway to his mouth. “Don’t mess with livestock. You hear me?”**

**“I’m not going to,” I said fast. “I was just asking.”**

**But the question was already alive in me.**

**If it was real, I wanted to know. If it was fake, I wanted to prove my brother wrong.**

**Mostly, I wanted to do something that felt like a story I could tell later. Something that made me feel older than thirteen without actually being older.**

**That’s how it started.**

**Three of us, because three was the magic number for dumb ideas.**

**Me. Nate. And Lila.**

**Nate lived two streets over and had a laugh like a bark. His dad was a deputy who always looked exhausted. Nate’s house smelled like gun oil and laundry detergent. He’d been dared into doing things before and hated backing down. If you told Nate something was scary, his face would tighten like he was swallowing a nail and he’d say, “So?”**

**Lila was different. She was the kind of kid who carried a pocketknife “just in case.” She had freckles and a mouth that didn’t hesitate. Her mom worked nights at the hospital and Lila spent a lot of time alone, which made her older in a way none of us were. When she talked, you listened, because she didn’t waste words.**

**We planned it like it was a mission.**

**We couldn’t use flashlights at first. Light spooked animals, my brother said. Also, light gave you away.**

**So we’d go out right after midnight when the town was asleep and the night bugs were loud enough to cover our footsteps. We’d ride our bikes out past the last streetlight, past the feed store, past the place where the pavement gave up and turned to gravel. We’d cut across the drainage ditch and follow the fence line to Harlow’s farm.**

**Harlow’s farm was the closest one with cows. Mr. Harlow was a heavy man with a red face who sold sweet corn from a table by the road. His pasture backed up to a thin stand of cottonwoods and then more fields beyond. The cows were black and brown and big enough to make you feel small even in daylight.**

**We told ourselves we weren’t going to hurt them. We were just going to “see.” Just going to test the myth.**

**And if it worked… well.**

**That afternoon, I stole a flashlight from the junk drawer in our kitchen. It was one of those old metal ones that took D batteries and felt like it could crack someone’s skull if you swung it. I also took a handful of batteries from the pack under the sink, because I’d learned the hard way that flashlights always died right when you needed them.**

**My brother wasn’t home. He’d left in his beat-up truck to go drink beer by the river with kids who’d already graduated. He didn’t know we were trying to fact-check his story. If he had, he’d have laughed and called me a baby and then somehow convinced himself to come along to make it worse.**

**That night, I told my parents I was sleeping at Nate’s.**

**Mom barely looked up from her book. “Be home by noon tomorrow. Pancakes.”**

**“Okay,” I said, heart banging in my throat.**

**Dad grunted approval from behind the newspaper.**

**At Nate’s, we sat in his basement playing Sega and pretending we weren’t waiting for the clock to crawl forward. Lila came over around ten with a backpack and the kind of calm you only have when you’re either fearless or already broken in some way.**

**“What’s in the bag?” Nate asked.**

**“Stuff,” she said.**

**“Stuff like what?” I asked.**

**Lila unzipped it enough for us to see: a small first-aid kit, a pocketknife, a lighter, a pack of gum, a roll of duct tape, and a length of rope.**

**Nate blinked. “What are we doing, cow tipping or kidnapping?”**

**“Better to have it,” she said, and zipped it back up.**

**We didn’t say it out loud, but the truth was: it felt good to have someone like Lila with us. It made it feel less like we were trespassing kids and more like we were prepared.**

**When midnight finally came, it didn’t feel like the movies. It didn’t feel dramatic. It felt… ordinary.**

**The house creaked. The air smelled like carpet and old soda. Nate’s dad was snoring upstairs, a steady saw through the floorboards. The world outside was black, but not empty—there were always sounds in a small town. A distant dog barking. A train horn far away. A car passing like a brief rush of wind.**

**We slipped out the basement door and wheeled our bikes through the yard.**

**The street was dead. Porch lights were off. Windows were dark. The only light came from the moon, a thin white slice that made the shadows sharp.**

**We pedaled fast at first, laughing quietly, nerves making us giddy. Then we hit the edge of town and the pavement ended and the gravel started popping under our tires.**

**The further we went, the quieter it got.**

**The night bugs were loud, but everything else fell away. No more houses. No more streetlights. Just the road, the fields, and the black sky stretched wide like it was pressing down.**

**Harlow’s farm showed up as a darker shape against the darkness: the barn, the farmhouse, the silo. A windmill creaked slowly, like it was turning in its sleep.**

**We ditched our bikes in the ditch under some tall grass and waited, crouched low, listening.**

**No lights in the house. No movement. Just the far-off lowing of cattle, sleepy and deep.**

**“Okay,” Nate whispered. “We go around the back, by the cottonwoods.”**

**We moved like we’d practiced it, even though we hadn’t. The fence line was old wooden posts with two strands of barbed wire. The pasture beyond was a wide open stretch of grass that looked gray under moonlight.**

**We found a spot where the lower wire sagged, and we ducked under carefully, trying not to snag our shirts.**

**The moment my back cleared the wire, I felt something in my stomach drop. A sense of being somewhere I wasn’t supposed to be, somewhere the rules didn’t protect me.**

**The pasture smelled like warm animal and grass and something else—a sour edge that I didn’t recognize then.**

**We walked slowly, barefoot in our sneakers to keep from crunching too loud. The cows were scattered in lumps across the field, dark shapes against the lighter grass.**

**“See?” Nate whispered. “They’re asleep.”**

**“Are they?” I asked.**

**Lila didn’t answer. She was staring.**

**We got closer to the first cow, and my heart started banging harder. Even sleeping, it was huge. Its side rose and fell, slow and steady. Its head was down. Its legs were straight, locked, the way my brother said.**

**Nate grinned at me, white teeth in the dark. He held up his hands like a wrestler about to push someone out of a ring.**

**“Ready?” he mouthed.**

**I nodded, even though my mouth was dry.**

**We crept up on either side. Nate put his palms against the cow’s flank, and I did too, because that was the plan—two people pushing.**

**The cow’s hide was warm under my hands. Coarse hair. It smelled like earth and manure.**

**Nate counted silently with his fingers. Three… two… one…**

**We pushed.**

**Nothing happened.**

**The cow shifted, a small ripple under our hands, and then—suddenly—its head jerked up.**

**Its eye caught the moonlight and flashed wet and black.**

**It made a sound that wasn’t a moo. It was a harsh, startled bellow that vibrated in my chest.**

**We stumbled back.**

**The cow snorted and stamped once, then took a few heavy steps away, head swinging, as if trying to decide if we were predators or just annoying.**

**“Shit,” Nate whispered, laughing breathlessly. “Okay, okay. That one was awake.”**

**“It was asleep,” I hissed. “It was** ***sleeping*****.”**

**Lila’s face was tight. “Maybe your brother’s full of it.”**

**We tried another cow. This one was deeper in the pasture, closer to the cottonwoods. It stood with its head low, still as a statue.**

**We approached slower this time, trying to be silent.**

**Again, Nate and I placed our hands.**

**Again, we pushed.**

**Again, nothing tipped.**

**The cow shifted its weight, then swung its head and bellowed again, this time louder, more angry. It trotted away, hooves thudding like drums.**

**Nate’s grin faded. “Okay. So maybe it’s harder than—”**

**“Guys,” Lila whispered.**

**Her voice was different.**

**She wasn’t teasing. She wasn’t annoyed.**

**She was… careful.**

**We turned toward her.**

**She was pointing, her arm extended toward the cottonwoods.**

**At first, I didn’t see anything. Just the dark line of trees and the shadowed grass.**

**Then I saw a shape on the ground.**

**Not a cow-shaped lump. Something wrong.**

**We moved toward it, slowly now. The night felt colder, or maybe my skin was just reacting to fear.**

**The shape was a cow.**

**But it wasn’t lying down like the others.**

**It was on its side, twisted, legs bent at angles that didn’t look natural. Its belly was open.**

**I stopped so fast my sneaker slid in the damp grass.**

**“Oh my god,” Nate whispered.**

**Even in the dark, I could see the slick shine of something wet. The smell hit me a second later—thick, metallic, like pennies, mixed with a hot sourness that made my throat tighten.**

**I’d never smelled death up close before. Not like that. Not the neat death of a mouse in a trap, not the antiseptic death of roadkill you passed too fast to really see.**

**This was big. This was wrong.**

**Lila clicked on her flashlight.**

**The beam cut through the pasture like a blade, and the cow lit up in stark detail.**

**Its hide was torn in long ragged strips. Its ribs showed. There were deep gouges along its neck and shoulder. The wound in its belly was not clean—it looked like something had** ***ripped*** **it open with impatience.**

**Inside, there was a cavity where organs should have been, and the edges of the wound were chewed, like meat torn away.**

**I made a sound without meaning to, a small choked noise.**

**Nate stepped closer, like his body didn’t believe what his eyes were seeing. “A dog?” he whispered. “Like… coyotes?”**

**Lila shook her head slowly. “Coyotes don’t do this.”**

**“How do you know?” I asked, voice too high.**

**She didn’t look at me. She was scanning the ground around the cow.**

**The flashlight beam swept over trampled grass. Dark smears. Something like drag marks.**

**Then it caught something else.**

**Tracks.**

**Not hoofprints. Not pawprints like the dog tracks I’d seen in mud.**

**These were… strange.**

**They were too deep, like whatever made them was heavy, but the shape didn’t match anything I knew. Long, splayed impressions, as if toes or claws had dug in.**

**Nate swallowed. “Maybe it’s a bear.”**

**“There aren’t bears here,” I said automatically, because that was a fact I knew. That was a safe fact.**

**Lila’s flashlight beam moved again.**

**It landed on another shape farther into the trees.**

**Another cow.**

**This one was upright.**

**For half a second, my brain tried to categorize it as alive, standing, normal.**

**Then I saw it wasn’t moving.**

**It was propped against a tree, like it had stumbled there and died. Its head hung at a terrible angle. There was a long rip down its side, and its insides… its insides were spilling out like something had opened it and then walked away mid-meal.**

**The beam made the blood look black.**

**Nate whispered, “We should go.”**

**I nodded so hard my neck hurt.**

**We turned, keeping our flashlights low now, like light was suddenly a liability instead of comfort. We moved faster, but not running yet, because running makes noise, and noise is something that happens before you get caught.**

**As we backed away, Lila’s light flicked across the ground one more time.**

**And stopped.**

**Her beam froze on something near the second cow.**

**Something hunched.**

**At first, I thought it was a stump, or a shadow shaped like a person.**

**Then it moved.**

**Not fast. Not like an animal darting.**

**It moved with the slow, deliberate shift of something that knew it didn’t have to hurry.**

**The beam caught part of it—skin, or something like skin, pale and uneven. A curve that might have been a shoulder. A glint that might have been wet muscle.**

**Nate whispered, “Turn it off.”**

**Lila didn’t. She couldn’t, like her thumb was stuck.**

**The creature lifted its head.**

**And even now, decades later, when I try to describe what I saw, my brain protests. It tries to soften it. It tries to make it fit into something known.**

**It didn’t.**

**It was too tall to be a dog. Too wrong to be a man.**

**Its head was elongated, not like a wolf, not like a horse—more like something stretched, pulled, as if nature had started building one animal and then changed its mind halfway through. Its mouth was open, and the mouth was… not a mouth. It was too wide, split farther back than it should go, lined with teeth that didn’t look like teeth you’d find on any Kansas predator.**

**Its arms—because yes, they were arms—were long and jointed wrong, with hands that ended in fingers too thin, too many bends, like spider legs wearing skin.**

**It was crouched over the cow like a vulture, but it didn’t peck or tear delicately. It had both hands sunk into the opened belly, and it was pulling something out in a slow, savoring way.**

**It looked up into the flashlight beam.**

**And its eyes caught the light.**

**Not reflective like an animal’s. Not human.**

**Flat. Dark. Bottomless.**

**For a fraction of a second, it held perfectly still.**

**And then it made a sound.**

**Not a roar.**

**Not a growl.**

**It was like wet lungs trying to laugh.**

**A gurgling, grinding noise that carried across the pasture, and it was so unnatural that my whole body revolted. My skin went cold. My stomach turned.**

**Lila finally snapped her flashlight off.**

**But it was too late. Light or no light, we’d been seen.**

**There was a pause, a heartbeat-long silence where even the bugs seemed to stop.**

**Then something heavy hit the ground.**

**The creature moved.**

**It rose from its crouch and unfolded itself, standing taller, taller, until it was almost as high as the cow’s shoulder—maybe higher.**

**It took one step forward.**

**The grass flattened under its weight.**

**Nate grabbed my wrist. “Run.”**

**And we did.**

**We bolted, not caring about noise now, not caring about stealth. My sneakers tore through the grass, catching on clumps. My lungs burned like I’d swallowed fire. The darkness ahead looked suddenly thick, like it had weight.**

**Behind us, there was movement—fast now.**

**Not hooves. Not paws.**

**Something hitting the ground with a rhythmic, uneven pattern, like it didn’t run the way animals run. Like it didn’t have to.**

**I risked a glance back.**

**I shouldn’t have.**

**The moonlight caught it in flashes between trees: long limbs, a pale sheen, a head that bobbed too smoothly for something made of bone.**

**It was coming straight for us.**

**Lila was ahead, her flashlight bouncing, throwing brief strobing slices of the pasture into light. Nate was beside me, his face a mask of panic.**

**“Fence!” Lila shouted.**

**I saw it up ahead—the barbed wire line we’d ducked under. It looked impossibly far.**

**We sprinted.**

**The creature behind us made that wet-laugh sound again, louder, closer. I could hear breath—or something like breath—pushing through that too-wide mouth.**

**A cow bellowed somewhere to our left, terrified now, the sound huge and helpless.**

**We hit the fence at full speed.**

**Nate didn’t slow. He grabbed the top wire and threw himself over, ripping his shirt, skin catching. He didn’t even scream. He just went.**

**Lila ducked low and slid under, like she’d done it a hundred times. The rope in her backpack slapped the ground.**

**I hesitated, because for one stupid second, my brain tried to be careful, tried to remember the barbs, the way they tear.**

**That second almost got me killed.**

**Something hit the ground behind me with a thud that I felt through my feet.**

**I heard grass ripping, like claws digging in.**

**I dropped to my stomach and shoved under the lower wire, not caring that it snagged my back, not caring that the barbs scratched my skin.**

**Pain flared and then vanished under adrenaline.**

**I popped up on the other side, breath ragged, and ran toward the ditch where our bikes were hidden.**

**Nate was already there, fumbling, yanking his bike out of the grass.**

**Lila had hers upright, flashlight clenched between her teeth so she could use both hands.**

**I grabbed my bike, fingers shaking so hard I nearly dropped it.**

**Behind us, there was a metallic twang.**

**The fence wire vibrated.**

**Something hit it.**

**Then another hit, harder.**

**I turned in time to see the fence posts shudder.**

**The creature was at the fence line.**

**In the thin moonlight, I saw it clearer than I wanted to.**

**It was pressing against the wire, not like it didn’t understand fences, but like it was testing it—feeling it. One long hand wrapped around the top wire, fingers curling between barbs like they didn’t care about pain.**

**Its head tilted.**

**And then it** ***looked*** **at us.**

**Not at the bikes. Not at the road.**

**At us.**

**Like it knew what we were.**

**Like it could pick us out as individuals.**

**Then it opened its mouth, and the wet-laugh became a high, keening sound that made my teeth ache. It wasn’t rage. It wasn’t hunger.**

**It sounded like delight.**

**“GO!” Nate screamed.**

**We jumped on our bikes and pedaled so hard the chains rattled.**

**The gravel road tore under our tires, spraying stones. My legs burned instantly, muscles screaming from sprinting. My lungs felt too small.**

**Behind us, I heard the fence snap.**

**A sound like a guitar string breaking.**

**I didn’t look back again.**

**We flew down the road, past the cornfields, past the shadowed ditch water, past the place where the road bent and the trees thickened. The night air sliced into my throat.**

**I expected, any second, to feel a hand on my shoulder. To feel claws in my back tire. To hear that wet breath right behind me.**

**But all I heard was our bikes and our panting.**

**And then…**

**Something else.**

**A sound pacing us in the field to our right.**

**Not on the road. In the grass.**

**Keeping up.**

**There was a rustling that moved parallel to us, too fast for a person running through uneven ground, too heavy to be a deer.**

**Lila glanced right and swore, a sharp whisper.**

**Nate’s eyes were wide. “It’s—”**

**“Don’t say it,” I gasped.**

**Because saying it would make it real in a new way.**

**The rustling kept pace.**

**For a few seconds, it almost felt like a game, like something was chasing us for fun.**

**Then the sound moved closer.**

**The rustling became snapping stalks, a heavier impact, as if whatever it was had changed direction and was angling toward the road.**

**I pedaled harder, legs turning to fire. My vision tunneled.**

**The road ahead dipped into a low spot where the gravel got loose. My front tire fishtailed.**

**I almost went down.**

**If I’d crashed there, I know—*****I know*****—I wouldn’t be here writing this.**

**Nate swerved toward me and grabbed my handlebar for a second to steady me, then shot ahead again.**

**We hit the first streetlight at the edge of town like it was a finish line.**

**The yellow glow spilled over us, making the world look suddenly normal: a mailbox, a parked car, a patch of weeds.**

**And the sound in the field stopped.**

**Not faded.**

**Stopped.**

**Like a switch.**

**We didn’t slow until we reached Nate’s house.**

**We dumped our bikes in the yard and stumbled inside through the basement door, slamming it shut behind us. Nate flipped the deadbolt with shaking hands.**

**We stood there in the dark basement, panting, sweat cooling on our skin, listening.**

**Nothing.**

**No scratching. No breathing. No wet-laugh.**

**Just the house settling and the distant sound of a train horn.**

**For a minute, none of us spoke.**

**Then Nate started laughing.**

**Not because it was funny.**

**Because his brain couldn’t handle the other option.**

**His laughter came out high and broken. “Holy shit,” he whispered. “Holy** ***shit*****.”**

**Lila didn’t laugh. She sat on the bottom stair and put her head in her hands.**

**I stood there holding the flashlight like it was still turned on, like it was still connected to that beam that had found the creature.**

**My skin prickled where the barbed wire had scratched me, and I realized my shirt was torn. I could feel warm blood on my back.**

**“What was it?” I finally whispered.**

**Nate’s laughter died. He looked at me like I’d asked him to name a color.**

**“I don’t know,” he said, voice flat. “I don’t know.”**

**Lila lifted her head. Her eyes were wet, but she didn’t look like she was crying. She looked like someone who’d just watched something irreversible happen.**

**“We don’t talk about it,” she said.**

**Nate blinked. “What?”**

**“We don’t tell anybody,” she said, firmer. “They won’t believe us. And if they do… they’ll go out there.”**

**I thought of my brother, fearless and stupid in the way older teens can be. I thought of him laughing, calling us liars, going out there with a baseball bat to prove he wasn’t scared.**

**My stomach twisted.**

**“Okay,” I whispered. “Okay.”**

**We stayed in Nate’s basement until the sky started to lighten around the edges, turning from black to deep blue.**

**When his dad woke up and came downstairs around six for his coffee, we were sitting on the couch like we’d never moved.**

**His eyes narrowed. “Why do you look like you got chased?”**

**Nate swallowed. “Nightmare,” he said quickly.**

**His dad looked at our dirty shoes, the grass stains, the torn shirt on my back.**

**He opened his mouth like he was going to press.**

**Then he saw Lila.**

**Something shifted in his face. Maybe because Lila never looked scared, and she looked scared now.**

**He didn’t ask again.**

**He just said, “You boys stay out of trouble,” and went upstairs.**

**I went home around ten, earlier than I’d said. Mom took one look at me and asked, “What happened?”**

**“Fell,” I lied.**

**She frowned at the scratches on my back when I changed shirts, but she didn’t push. In small towns, parents learn a certain kind of resignation. They know their kids will break rules. They just hope the rules break back gently.**

**For weeks after, I couldn’t sleep right.**

**Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that beam of light landing on pale, uneven skin. I heard the wet-laugh. I pictured fingers wrapping around barbed wire like it was nothing.**

**I started checking my window at night, even though we lived in town, even though there was no pasture behind my house.**

**I listened for rustling in the grass when I walked home from anywhere after dark.**

**Nate got quiet. He stopped daring people to do things. He stopped laughing at scary stories. When someone told a joke about cow tipping in the locker room, his face went pale and he left.**

**Lila didn’t come around as much. When she did, she was sharp and tense, like she was holding herself together with willpower alone.**

**One afternoon in late July, about three weeks after the farm, I rode my bike past Harlow’s place on the main road in broad daylight.**

**I told myself it was curiosity.**

**Really, it was compulsion. Like if I looked at it in sunlight, it would become less real.**

**The pasture looked normal. Green grass. Cows scattered, chewing and flicking their tails.**

**But there were fewer of them.**

**And along the fence line, every post had been reinforced with new wire. Fresh, shiny barbed wire layered over the old.**

**There were also signs nailed up: NO TRESPASSING. PRIVATE PROPERTY. VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED.**

**I saw Mr. Harlow standing by the barn with two other men. One of them was Nate’s dad.**

**They weren’t talking like neighbors.**

**They were talking like something had happened.**

**Their bodies were stiff, faces serious. When Mr. Harlow looked out toward the pasture, he didn’t look angry. He looked afraid.**

**I pedaled past without slowing, heart hammering.**

**That night, I heard sirens. Just once, around two in the morning. They went out toward the farms, then faded.**

**In the morning, my mom said at breakfast, “Did you hear about Harlow’s cows?”**

**I froze with my spoon halfway to my mouth.**

**Dad grunted. “Coyotes, they think. Maybe wild dogs. Took two more last night.”**

**Mom shook her head. “Two more? That’s awful.”**

**Dad sipped coffee. “Harlow’s going to start shooting at anything that moves.”**

**I stared at my cereal until it went soggy.**

**Coyotes.**

**Wild dogs.**

**That’s what everyone said. That’s what everyone** ***needed*** **it to be.**

**But I’d seen the tracks. I’d seen the hands.**

**I’d seen the eyes that didn’t reflect.**

**Later that week, I saw my brother again. He came home sunburned and hungover, and when he found me on the porch, he smirked.**

**“You ever find out about cow tipping?” he asked.**

**My throat tightened.**

**I forced a shrug. “No.”**

**He laughed. “Probably for the best. You’d get your ass kicked by a cow.”**

**I didn’t correct him.**

**I didn’t tell him the truth.**

**Because some truths aren’t meant to spread.**

**August came. School started. Life moved on the way life always does, because life doesn’t care what you’ve seen.**

**But some nights, when the wind is right, when the air smells like cut grass and distant rain, I swear I can hear it.**

**Not in town.**

**Not close.**

**Far out, past the last streetlight, past the grain elevator, past the place where the pavement ends.**

**A sound like wet lungs trying to laugh.**

**And then I’m thirteen again, sprinting through a pasture with my heart in my throat, knowing something that shouldn’t exist has decided I** ***do*****.**

**People ask sometimes why I never liked the countryside the way other kids did. Why I never went hunting. Why I never wanted to camp.**

**I always give a safe answer.**

**Bugs. Allergies. I don’t like getting dirty.**

**I never tell them about Harlow’s farm.**

**I never tell them about the dead cows.**

**I never tell them about the way the fence snapped behind us.**

**Because the most terrifying part isn’t what we saw.**

**It’s what we didn’t.**

**We saw it over the cow, eating like it belonged there.**

**We saw it chase us like it was playing.**

**But we never saw it stop.**

**We never saw it give up.**

**We just crossed into the light, and the sound in the field shut off like it was waiting.**

**Waiting for a night when the town sleeps deeper.**

**Waiting for a night when the border of the yard light doesn’t feel like enough.**

**And here’s the part I don’t say out loud, not even to myself unless I have to:**

**There are things that learn.**

**That creature didn’t break the fence because it was confused.**

**It broke it because it understood that fences can be broken.**

**It stopped at the first streetlight not because it was afraid of light, but because it was** ***smart enough to know where we were going*****.**

**Because it knew the road.**

**Because it knew the shape of the town.**

**And because it knew that thirteen-year-old boys don’t stay thirteen forever.**

**Sometimes, when I’m driving late on country roads, I’ll catch movement in the field beside me—just a shift in the tall grass, just a ripple that keeps pace for a second too long.**

**And I won’t look.**

**I’ll keep my eyes on the road, hands tight on the wheel, and I’ll drive faster, because I’ve learned something important since that summer:**

**You don’t go back to prove a story wrong.**

**Not when the thing that proved you right might still be out there, listening.**

**And you don’t shine your flashlight into the dark unless you’re ready for the dark to look back.**
