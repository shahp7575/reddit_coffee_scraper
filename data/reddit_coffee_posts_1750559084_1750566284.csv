Enough years after school it seems the pool dries up and there are no 'natural' ways to run into women anymore in the course of everyday life. My problem is 80-90% very few women are interested and maybe 10-20% the few that might be I don't find physically attractive. Just wondering if there was anything I was missing or ways to improve my game.

This is what I am trying so far with no real success:

Online 'dating' apps Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/CoffeeMeetsBagel: Paid for some of them. All I have to show for it is a few likes. Universally the women will either unmatch immediately or stop responding after a couple lines. Not entirely sure why since while I'm no Shakespeare my openings aren't any worse than others I've seen. I think I've gotten one actual date from the years I've been on this shit.

Workplace: Everybody at work seemingly is already in a relationship.

IRL Social Network: I have a very sparse social network. I've tried to cultivate a larger one without much more success than my attempts to court women. Turns out older working adults don't want to hang out that much. Let alone do so to provide an avenue for you to network with someone else.

Hobbies: My true hobbies are mostly internet and computer related or things you sit inside a building often alone on. Not much of the right social potential there.

Going out to Events: Easier said than done. Without a network the only thing I can think of is to scroll through Eventbrite and hit up random events. Usually the result is I awkwardly meander through a bunch of families or random people in their own groups hoping to run into a single woman.

Singles events/speeding dating: Compared to general events and online dating at least I actually meet a few women but success is still very low. Usually I don't have any matches or I'll get a number or match and they won't respond. And to be honest I am not really physically attracted to most of the women that tend to attend these events that I've been to. Yep I understand 'shoe on other foot' But these women don't show much interest in my either.

Family: My family has introduced me to some girls. But either they aren't interested or in other cases I just didn't find them physically attractive. I never 'dump' them. I just don't feel attracted enough to them to go full bore marriage mode right away and apparently that ends my chance.

Walking up to randos: The only way I can consistently 'meet' women I'm attracted to. The problem with this I can't do it outside of a few rare times without coming off as extremely creepy. I'm generally only able to pull it off when I'm in a situation where I see the girl multiple times and/or can strike up a natural long term conversation with them and opportunities for that I find in practice are much rarer than one might think. In order to expand I'll have to master the art of simply walking up to girls and immediately propositioning with no build up and I haven't built up the balls to do that yet. Oh and theres also the everpresent danger that they might have a boyfriend or husband around which makes this even more difficult.

Stuff I'm trying to work on:

Work Out, dressing and being presentable .

Stuff I haven't really done yet:

Start a sidegig/hobby like salsa dancing, yoga, volunteer at a animal shelter etc that women like: This is the advice I hear a lot and I'm sort of confused how to pull it off due to the type of time commitment (at least with events you can knock them out rapidly on your own schedule). If I come in the first day as an animal shelter volutneer and don't see anyone I like can I just drop it since I don't really have an interest in the gig otherwise? Or do I just continue to volunteer for the next few months to not be rude?

**Murder of Rachael Runyan**

The **murder of Rachael Runyan** is an unsolved [child murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_murder) which occurred in [Sunset, Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset,_Utah), on August 26, 1982, when a three-year-old girl was [abducted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abduction) from a playground and murdered by an unknown individual. Her body was found three weeks later in a creek bed in nearby [Morgan County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_County,_Utah).

One of Utah's most notorious [cold cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case), Rachael's murder ultimately proved a catalyst to establish the ""Rachael Alert"" [child abduction alert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abduction_alert_system), which remained in use in the state of Utah until 2003, when the state adopted the national [AMBER alert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_alert) child abduction emergency alert system.

The abduction and murder of Rachael Runyan was a factor in the 1983 passage of the US Congressional [Missing Children's Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_Children%27s_Assistance_Reauthorization_Act_of_2013), which [mandated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_(criminal_law)) an allocation of additional resources for the investigation of ongoing [missing children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_person#Categories_of_missing_children) cases.

In 2017, the Rachael Runyan Missing and Exploited Children's Day was signed into legislation in Utah. The purpose of the annual observance is to raise public awareness of missing and [exploited children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse) within the state; the annual awareness date is August 26, the date of Rachael's abduction. Runyan's abduction and murder remain unsolved.

**Background**

Rachael Marie Runyan was born on June 23, 1979, in [Weber County, Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_County,_Utah), the second child and only daughter of Jeff and Elaine Runyan. She had an older brother, Justin, and a younger brother, Nathan.

The Runyan family had moved to [Sunset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset,_Utah) from [Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee) just before Rachael's birth; her mother would later recall she and her husband had believed Sunset—then a community of 6,000 inhabitants—would be a ""wonderful and safe place"" to raise their children. Rachael was a child beauty queen, having been crowned ""Little Miss Sunset"" the year before her murder. She has been described by her mother as a well-behaved child who, often being too young to participate in playground games with Justin and other children, was content to simply sit aside and suck her thumb watching the other children play. This habit had led to her mother occasionally teasing Rachael that she would become ""[bucktoothed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_bite_malocclusion#Anterior_open_bite)"" as an adult, to which Rachael would simply giggle. Despite the sense of security Jeff and Elaine Runyan felt within the community of Sunset, both parents repeatedly warned their children of the dangers of trusting anybody they did not know who attempted to lure them from their home or any safe environment.

The family lived in a modest home adjacent to the Doxey Elementary School playground. A park the three children were fond of in which they regularly played, Mitchell Park, was also near their home. In the summer of 1982, Jeff and Elaine Runyan installed a gate in their backyard fence, so the family could easily access this playground.

**Abduction**

In the late morning of August 26, 1982, Rachael Runyan and her five-year-old brother Justin asked their mother if they and their younger brother Nathan, aged 18 months, could play in the playground of Doxey Elementary School. Although Elaine Runyan had never allowed her children to play unsupervised anywhere outside the family home, because she was preparing lunch for her children when they made the request, and the school playground was just 15 feet (4.6 m) from her home, well within sight of her kitchen window, she agreed to it. Nonetheless, Runyan looked repeatedly out the kitchen window and conversed with her children as she prepared the meal.

When she called her children to lunch at approximately 12:55 p.m., only Nathan and Justin returned home. Justin blurted out to her that Rachael had been taken from the park by force moments before by a young black man who had initially offered to buy her ice cream and bubble gum at a nearby supermarket. According to Justin, the man had approached them as they played in the sandpit, attempting to lure the siblings into his car with an offer to purchase candy for the trio. When they were close to the man's car, Rachael told him she liked bubble gum–flavored ice cream. The man claimed to have this flavor of ice cream in his car. Justin said when he warned Rachael not to accompany the man any further, she began to turn and walk away from him. In response, he simply picked Rachael up and placed her over his shoulder before bundling her, screaming, into his car as Justin stood frozen in fear with Nathan standing by his side.

Elaine rushed to the supermarket the kidnapper had mentioned, repeatedly asking staff and shoppers: ""Have you seen a little blond girl? A 3-year-old with a black man?"" Nobody she encountered had seen her child. Approximately 20 minutes after her daughter's disappearance, Elaine reported Rachael's abduction to the Sunset Police Department.

**Investigation**

Immediately upon learning of Rachael's abduction, the Sunset Police Department set up roadblocks in and around the city. This tactic failed to help police apprehend the suspect or to recover Rachael. In the hours following her abduction, a task force consisting of ten law enforcement investigators was formed to investigate the child's disappearance. These investigators were recruited from several Utah counties and supervised by Sheriff Brant Johnston.

Both Justin Runyan, and a 10-year-old child who had also been approached by the man at the playground, described him to investigators as being a light-complexioned [African-American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans), aged between 30 and 35 years old, 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, with a medium build, an afro-style haircut and a handlebar mustache. He drove an older model four-door dark-blue car with wood-grain stripes along the sides. The man had been at Mitchell Park, talking to various children and drinking coffee for a minimum of 15 minutes before abducting Rachael. Investigators also discovered this individual had played with the three Runyan children for several minutes before they had accompanied him partway to his vehicle.

Although [eyewitness memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewitness_memory) enabled police to obtain an accurate physical description of the child's abductor from which they were able to construct a detailed [composite drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_composite), the only [witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness) to Rachael's abduction had been the three children. No [CCTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV) had captured her abduction from the school grounds. As such, beyond police and media appeals, subsequent law enforcement efforts were effectively limited to procedures like [forensic searches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_search) of the crime scene and house-to-house inquiries in the hours and days after the event.

Public appeals for information about Rachael's disappearance did lead to investigators receiving multiple leads both in relation to the whereabouts of the child and the possible identity of her abductor. Although all leads were vigorously pursued they ultimately proved fruitless.

**Family efforts and media appeals**

With assistance from an assembled neighborhood committee (many of whom donated money to an improvised family search effort), the Runyan family began its own efforts to search for their daughter. Both the family and neighborhood volunteers had limited means and methods for the search at their disposal, although a nationwide distribution of flyers displaying Rachael's picture was organized. With the assistance of friends and neighbors, the Runyan family searched local neighborhoods and distributed thousands of missing person posters and flyers alerting the public to Rachael's disappearance. Within three weeks, this initiative had cost the family $10,000 in postage expenses alone.

One week after Rachael's abduction, her parents flew to [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City) to attend a press conference intended to maintain the extensive publicity surrounding their daughter's disappearance. At this press conference, Jeff Runyan said: ""I feel \[the abductor\] is without [conscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience), and my plea is for someone who knows him to come forward and sell him out."" Acknowledging the possibility Rachael might have been sold following her abduction, Elaine Runyan urged all parents planning on adopting a little girl in the near future to ensure the child was not Rachael.

On September 3, Rachael's parents appeared on the [*Today*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(U.S._TV_program)) show to continue to publicize Rachael's disappearance. They offered a $20,000 reward raised largely through donations from concerned citizens in their community. The city of Sunset also pledged an additional $20,000 for the child's safe return.

**Discovery**

At 5:00 p.m. on September 19, a family traveling on a mountain road in [Mountain Green, Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Green,_Utah) (approximately 50 miles (80 km) from Sunset) stopped their vehicle at a turnout close to Trapper's Loop Road to let their children play at a nearby stream and throw rocks into the water. Close to a pile of brush, the children observed what they initially believed was a doll, partly covered in shrubbery floating at the edge of the stream. On closer inspection, the children realized the doll was actually the nude body of a female toddler with her hands [bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_(knot)) behind her back.

Rachael's relatives were able to offer tentative identification of her body from a chipped tooth and piercings in her ears. Due to the advanced state of the body's decomposition, the precise cause of Rachael's death was never established. The [coroner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner) was unable to exclude [smothering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia#Smothering) as the cause of death.

**Funeral**

Shortly after the formal identification of their daughter, Jeff and Elaine Runyan held Rachael's funeral service at the Sunset Stake Center. Over 300 mourners were in attendance. Rachael was laid to rest in Washington Heights Memorial Park in the city of [Ogden, Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogden,_Utah). She was buried in a white casket adorned with her photograph, a single pink rosebud, and one of her favorite [Raggedy Ann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raggedy_Ann) dolls. Rachael's gravestone is inscribed with the words: ""She brought a nation to its knees.""

**Federal impact**

The abduction and murder of Rachael Runyan proved to be a major factor in the October 1982 passage of a [federal law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Law#United_States) allowing the parents of missing children access to a clearinghouse administered by the [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation) (FBI), which would obtain and file records of the [fingerprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint) and [blood types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type) of more than 300,000 Utah children.

As a result of this abduction and murder, the state of Utah also formally implemented the ""Rachael Alert"" child abduction alert system in April 2002. It was designed to alert residents statewide of active child abduction and missing children cases. Once law enforcement personnel verified the authenticity of a child abduction case, a ""Rachael Alert"" form was [faxed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax) to all television and radio networks for immediate and high-priority statewide broadcast. The criteria to be met in these cases included: the missing child was a minor or mentally handicapped; that they were in imminent danger; that the disappearance was not a runaway situation; and that law enforcement had a complete and accurate physical description of the missing child.

The ""Rachael Alert"" system was only used in the June 2002 [abduction of Elizabeth Smart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_of_Elizabeth_Smart) and the January 2003 abduction of 3-month-old Nicholas Triplett; both children were ultimately found alive. In the wake of Elizabeth Smart's subsequent safe recovery, 41 states implemented the [AMBER Alert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_alert) child abduction alert system. Utah replaced the ""Rachael Alert"" system with the AMBER Alert system in April 2003—primarily to conform with nationwide standards. The AMBER Alert system is now tested twice a year in Utah— on January 13 and on the anniversary of Rachael's abduction, August 26.

Rachael's murder was also a factor in the passing of the [Missing Children's Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_Children%27s_Assistance_Reauthorization_Act_of_2013), which places descriptions of missing children in the FBI's National Crime Information Computer database.

**Ongoing investigation**

**Reopening of case**

Although Rachael's murder is an unsolved case, Lieutenant Phil Olmstead, who first answered Elaine Runyan's frantic call for assistance following her daughter's abduction, continually assured the Runyan family of the Sunset Police Department's determination to find Rachael's murderer or murderers. The investigation into her murder was officially reopened by the Sunset Police Department in 2007. Police continue working closely with the [Utah Attorney General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Attorney_General)'s office in their efforts to apprehend and convict the perpetrator(s). A reward of $58,000 is available should any information leading to the arrest and subsequent conviction of the person or persons responsible be provided to authorities.

Hopes for the identification of the perpetrator rest primarily on notable advances in [forensic technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science) in the years since 1982. As a means to this end, investigators have not ruled out the possibility of [exhuming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial) Rachael's body to retrieve further [forensic evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_identification).

[DNA testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing) conducted on items found near Rachael's body in 2007 yielded tentative results, although they have not helped advance the investigation. Rachael's family has never given up hope her killer will be found.

**Suspects**

In 2012, investigators announced that a prison inmate in [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania) who had been a resident of Sunset in 1982 was under active investigation. Although no formal charges have been filed against this individual, he is considered a possible suspect in Rachael's abduction and murder. Another potential suspect is a man with a criminal record who is believed to live in [New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico). Sunset Police Chief Ken Eborn has said that evidence supporting the potential [guilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_(law)) of this suspect exists, but it is [insufficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)) for police to make a formal arrest. Furthermore, Eborn has said he is convinced that witnesses or individuals with knowledge of the man's guilt are reluctant to come forward to authorities—possibly because of death threats he has made against them.

**Advocacy and legacy**

Following her daughter's abduction and murder, Elaine Runyan-Simmons channeled her grief into action, becoming an outspoken advocate in a national movement to raise awareness of issues regarding child safety, child abduction, and the legislated procedures regarding their recovery. Runyan-Simmons has frequently offered emotional support, guidance and advice to parents undergoing a similar experience to her family's ordeal.

Regarding her ongoing commitment to the perpetuation and expansion of Utah's ""Rachael Alert"" [child abduction alert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abduction_alert_system) (which was subsumed under the nationwide AMBER alert system in 2003), Runyan-Simmons has said that being a voice in this field of advocacy is not a choice she would have made had Rachael not been abducted and murdered: the events of August and September 1982 left her with little choice in this matter. In 2013, Runyan-Simmons stated: ""It's a legacy I leave for my daughter. If there was something in place like this \[in 1982\], maybe we'd still have her.""

In May 2016, the park where Rachael was abducted was renamed Rachael Runyan Memorial Park. It was formally dedicated to Rachael's memory on August 26; a memorial stone bearing an image of the girl, a brief summary of her story, and the park's name stands within its grounds. The inscription on the stone reads: ""In honor of Rachael Marie Runyan, June 23, 1979 - August 26, 1982. Abducted from Doxey Elementary Playground August 26, 1982.""

The Rachael Runyan Missing and Exploited Children's Day was signed into legislation in Utah in March 2017. The stated aim of this annual observance is to encourage individuals in Utah to prioritize child safety. The bill was inspired by Rachael Runyan, and has been described as a ""catalyst for the development of better responses to (child) abduction"" within Utah. In instances where an AMBER Alert is implemented and the missing child is subsequently found safe and well, a ""Rachael Runyan Award"" is presented to the individual who either locates the missing child or initially alerted authorities to his or her abduction.

( I know the word count is on the low side, but 50k is still considered novel length in the UK. I will work on this if I can get a good query together)

I worry it sounds boring - it's a quiet, emotional story so I'm finding it difficult to make the query 'pop' if that makes sense.

I'm not sure if the query should literally spell everything out - one of the main characters has dementia and choses to take her own life (handled sensitively off-page)

Should I include this in the query? (It's in the synopsis obviously)

Dear ***

Three women. One cafe. A lifetime of friendship - and a goodbye none of them are ready for.

TUESDAYS ARE FOR BISCUITS is an upmarket women’s fiction complete at 55,000 words. It may appeal to readers of The Story of Arthur Truluv by Elizabeth Berg and The Keeper of Lost Things by Ruth Hogan - heartfelt, character-led novels that examine later life, quiet courage, and enduring love.

Set almost entirely on consecutive Tuesdays at a local cafe in a small English market town, it follows three older women who meet weekly, bringing biscuits and a shared history

Although limited in length, I feel it is emotionally complete – a thought provoking, character-led story with a full narrative arc and lasting impact, ideal for reading clubs.

Lifelong friends Moira, Dot, and Grace have never missed a Tuesday at the Honeycomb Cafe – not in six years. Through grief, change, and the quiet heartbreak of later life, they’ve shown up, week after week, for tea, biscuits and support for one another. But things are starting to shift. Moira, once sharp and meticulous, is growing forgetful, losing track of time and lashing out without warning. Dot, brash and colourful, agonises over finding the daughter she was forced to give up for adoption decades ago. And Grace, recently widowed, is quietly supporting her adult daughter Emily, whose failing business now threatens the roof over her head.

As the cafe faces closure and Moira’s condition becomes increasingly more difficult to manage, the women find themselves pulled into deeper layers of honesty, guilt, and quiet reckoning. When Moira’s decline ends abruptly, Grace and Dot are left with a letter, a memory box and a journal. A final request leads them to the Cornish coast – and a new kind of Tuesday tradition.

First 300 (plus a scene setting prologue)

Prologue: The Honeycomb Cafe

Every Tuesday at 9am sharp, lifelong friends Grace, Moira, and Dot arrived at the Honeycomb Cafe, a snug little place tucked between the florist and the bookshop in Willowbridge’s high street. It wasn’t the sort of cafe that boasted trendy menus or Instagram-worthy cappuccinos. Instead, it was a comforting jumble of faded wallpaper, patchwork cushions, and mismatched chairs. The air was always filled with the delightful aroma of freshly brewed tea and delicious pastries. A chalkboard stood proudly outside the door, weathered and crooked – but charmingly so, as it peeked out from under a yellow-striped awning. Each morning it bore a handwritten quote: always new, always punny, and always just the right amount of cheese.


Chapter 1: Custard Creams

‘Life’s what you bake it’

Grace was usually first. This Tuesday was no different. She pulled her coat tightly around her against the crisp air, the early spring drizzle dissipating to a mist. The cobbles beneath her feet were slippery, reflecting the soft glow of the street lights still flickering in the gloom. She thought of Ted walking this same path with her on a similar misty morning, his easy laughter echoing in her mind.

Shops were stirring to life, their blinds lifting in unison, as Willowbridge slowly opened its eyes.
She liked to arrive early, in part to have a moment's peace before the others showed up, but also to watch the town come alive.

Pushing the door open, she was immediately embraced by its comforting warmth, the smell of buttered crumpets, and the familiar clinking of cups and saucers as the cafe’s owner, Mr Parker, prepared for the morning rush. He hummed along as the radio crackled softly in the background – a golden oldie Grace hadn’t heard since the village fete years ago.

His mornings followed a quiet routine he rarely deviated from – unlock the doors before the street was fully awake, flick on the lights, grind the beans, and let the gurgle of the coffee machine fill the silence. He always polished the counter with a clean cloth, before matching up the teacups with their saucers. It was more than just routine – it was reassurance, the calm before the gentle chaos of the day began.

As he smiled at her, the left side of his mouth drooped slightly from the stroke he’d suffered a few years back. ‘Ah Grace, a very good morning to you,’ he said, drying three cups in anticipation. ‘What’s the flavour of the week on this miserable Tuesday morning then?’
‘Custard creams,’ Grace said brightly, her breath fogging the window as she set her bag and coat down on the chair beside her.

1lhf2gs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lhf2gs,SEA by Jungsik is great,"I had an exceptional experience at SEA. everything was great, most things excellent. The crudo and tartare were fine and still a great amuse. 

  
The Tom yum noodles were under an awesome bed of herbs. The ribs, prawns, and eggs were all great. Ribs were perfectly tender. Prawns were meaty. Eggs were rich AF. Thai Links are unpictured but extremely flavorful. 

  
The cod was great and solid tho not life changing. Very well executed. The fried chicken is great particularly with the aromatic and vibrant cilantro dipping sauce. The pork sliders are equally well cooked and herbaceous as to be expected. Great, crying tiger esque dipping sauce. And then the famous short ribs.

  
Slow cooked. Tender. Ever so toothsome. And the curry along with it is deeply flavorful. The morning glory side is slept on. Tom yum noodles are like an awesome Asian Bolognese, and the crab fried rice IS AWESOME. Could eat two full bowls of that.

  
Then the surprisingly tasteful and refreshing desserts. Get both, I implore you. Cocktails are good though expensive.

  
My only complaint? The espresso martini is not great. Get the Monkey Business as a dessert cocktail. 

This is also tied with some great service leaning on a Jungsik-lite quality. very, very attentive and could be more ""fun"" of I dare say. The style is more casual and that service could be reflected with more personality. Still great for a casual experience.

1lhf0sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1lhf0sl/steal_these_viral_blueprints_before_theyre_gone/,Steal These Viral Blueprints Before They're Gone! 🔥 AI Content Vault Unlocked,"Hey friends! 🌟

Do you ever scroll through your feed and wonder why some posts just *take off*? Like, why did Aunt Linda's potato salad recipe get 1,000 likes while your meticulously crafted essay got 5? 🤔 It’s like magic, but I'm here to let you in on the secret: **there’s a blueprint to viral content!** 

Today, I’m officially unlocking the AI Content Vault! 🔑 Imagine having access to some killer strategies and ideas that could turn your posts into share-worthy gold. 

Here’s what you need to know:

### **Why Go Viral?**  
Let’s face it, going viral isn’t just about the glory. It’s about reaching people, connecting with them, and maybe, just maybe, changing a few lives along the way. Plus, who doesn’t want to sip their morning coffee with a side of internet fame? ☕️✨

### **Steal These Blueprints (Seriously)**  

1. **Emotional Hooks**: 
   - Trigger emotions! Happy, sad, angry - if it makes your audience *feel*, they’re more likely to engage. Think about those heartwarming rescue stories or gut-busting hilarious memes.
   
2. **Visual Appeal**: 
   - Use eye-catching images or short videos. A simple meme can go a long way. Just imagine a cat doing something ridiculous—instant share-fest. 🐱

3. **Timeliness**: 
   - Jump on trends! Is everyone buzzing about a new movie? Create content that ties into that excitement. It’s like getting a free ticket to the hype train! 🎢

4. **Call to Action (Without Saying It)**: 
   - Rather than asking readers to like or share, ask for their opinions or experiences. “What would you do in this situation?” gets people talking without feeling pressured.

5. **Stories Over Statistics**: 
   - Nobody remembers how many people were affected by a tornado; they remember *that one story* of a dog rescuing its owner. Share those heartwarming tales to spark conversations! ❤️

### **My Personal Secret**  
I recently posted a goofy meme about the struggles of working from home, and it blew up! Turns out, everyone feels like they’re in a never-ending Zoom call. I embraced the relatable chaos, added my personal touch, and boom - people shared it like crazy! **Why?** Because it resonated with their life! 🎉

So the next time you create content, remember these blueprints. Infuse your personality, embrace the joy in connection, and don’t shy away from sharing a little of your world. 

And who knows? You might find yourself leaking past the average likes and into the viral hall of fame! 🙌 Are these tips something you’re going to try out, or do you have your own go-to strategies? Let's unpack this together!",1,1750565377.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1lhf019,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lhf019,[Feedback Wanted] Pet Meetup App 🐾,"Hey Reddit! 👋

I’m building an app called **PawtnerUp** — it’s a local meetup app designed for both **pet owners** and **pet lovers** to find and host small events like dog playdates, park walks, or just hanging out with other animal people.

What makes it a bit different:
- You **don’t need to own a pet** to join events — some people just love being around pets or meeting others who do.
- You can also create or join events that are **pet-optional** (like pet-friendly coffee meetups or “no-pets-but-let’s-chat-about-corgis” events).
- There's a built-in group chat for every event, so people can coordinate before meeting.

📱 I’m currently looking for early testers on both **Android and iOS**. The app is 100% free while it's in beta, and I'd love your feedback to help shape it.

🔗 **If you’re interested, I'll include the link in comment

You’ll get an invite to download the app and try it out right away.

I’ve also added 3 screenshots below so you can see what the app looks like.  
Thanks in advance — I’m solo-building this and genuinely want it to be useful for both pet lovers *with* and *without* pets.

1lhezxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1lhezxo/coming_to_the_realization_this_may_be_coming_to/,Coming to the realization this may be coming to an end,"I will preface this to say, that I know this group isn’t overly positive about closed relationships, but I’m going to throw is put there anyways.

My husband and I have been ENM for about 3 years now, and got into our first (and only) poly relationship just over a year and a half ago. We met another couple at a lifestyle party, hooked up, started hanging out, and within a couple months were in love and moving in that direction. My husband and I had been open to the idea of poly, but weren’t necessarily looking for it. The other couple were barely ENM, and didn’t even know what poly meant. They were the first ones to say I love you, and the ones that moved the relationship forward, though we were all into it. From the get go I tried to start discussions about what we were all wanting out of this, and there general consensus was to just go with the flow, but they never wanted to have any sit down discussions (very much avoided it). When this all started we hung out often as a group, as families, and did solo dates weekly (all straight). 

There started being issues with the other wife having severe anxiety responses to me seeing her husband, full on panic attacks if we spent the night together. We all tried to support her in this, but to this day nothing has got better. To say there are co dependency issues is an understatement. Around the 9 month point, the dates became less often (they were too busy, and the time together changed). When we brought it up, they would argue that we didn’t understand how busy their life was, and they just couldn’t fit it all in every week (from my perspective we live a much busier life, but they have a lower capacity for handling busyness). So we would go 2 week periods without seeing them (we live 10 minutes away, yet even popping by for coffee, or after the kids were asleep was off the table).

As the planner of the group, I planned hangouts, parties, weekends away and vacations. Very little planning was done by them. We use to try to do sleepovers every 6-8 weeks (we both have young kids so getting babysitting was th challenge for them). Around the year mark I asked for a weekend away with my partner (and obviously the same would be given to the other couple). I was told I was crazy for asking, I couldn’t ask for him to be away from his wife and kid for 2 days. This was something that was very important to me, but it wasn’t even a discussion. I felt I waited until we had been together a long enough time, but it wasn’t even given any thought. 

I moved passed it, but then we had issues over trips in the winters (anxiety induced by the other wife, in which I got blamed because of my reaction to her flip outs). They then made the choice to block valentines weekend and keep it just between the two of them, even though I asked 5 weeks in advance for a date that weekend (I never get a weekend date, only weekdays). 

Things have continually got worse, they tell us they want the same as us, they want to spend time with us, that we are extremely important to them, that they don’t know what they would do without us. But the reality is their actions don’t show it. Week after week the dates are shorter (some weeks only getting a 2 hour walk). Yet they get every night together as a married couple. 

We haven’t had a sleepover since February, yet we’ve had the opportunity, including them coming over here when we all had babysitting but them deciding to leave at 1am because they wanted to sleep in their own bed. We keep our weekends open for them, yet they come for 2 hours and leave because they have to get their kid to bed (bed time seems to only be strict when they are over here). We offer to get babysitting for all the kids together, and they turn it down.

There is so much more to say, but as I am typing this I realize there is no point. There are issues in the relationship that won’t change (alcoholism I feel like has a big effect on everything, yet is denied by them).

We madly love this couple, and want to spend our time with them. And while they say they want the same. They don’t. We are the idiots for hanging on and trying to be happy. When they won’t change. We don’t have fun hangouts anymore. The one on one dates are fun, but every trip and hangout is ruined by them: either with anxiety or hangovers. 

My husband and I have agreed, we could find better solo, but also love the 4 way dynamic of mixing 2 families together. It would be quite amazing if the effort we gave was reciprocated, but I think we are realizing it won’t be.

I guess this has just turned into a vent. I don’t know if there is any positive advice we could be given at this point. ",2,1750565293.0,polyamory,4,0.75,False

- A scene of a cobblestone street surrounded by old brick/stone buildings with people walking and riding around on bikes, some of the people were monsters in disguise
- A scene of a sunny suburban neighborhood with a people outside looking happy, there was a woman on a bike with a severed hand in the basket, someone doing laundry with bloodied clothes, and children playing but there was something wrong with their shadows

My partner and I are thinking of opening a small takeaway bakery here in Sydney, focusing on coffee and baked goods (think pastries, cakes, cookies – no sit-down dining).

We're trying to figure out a lot of things, and would greatly appreciate any insights on:
 * General tips for starting a takeaway coffee/baked goods business in Sydney. What are the unique challenges or opportunities here?

 * Licensing, permits, and regulations – what should we be aware of beyond the obvious food safety requirements?

 * Learning to bake vs. hiring a pastry chef: We're keen to learn and do a lot ourselves, but for a commercial operation, is it realistic to learn to bake all the necessary items to a professional standard, or should we be prioritising hiring an experienced pastry chef from the get-go? What's the learning curve like for commercial baking?

Any advice will be appreciated!

As it so happens, I am also very interested in brain neurochemistry and I am trying to find the relation between coffee  and curing my anxiety. How does this work? Is there a deeper connection (which can be achieved without the use of caffeine? Caffeine does have side effects and the ware-off is not pleasant).

Sabi ng gf nya na thankful daw yung bf nya/ex ko saken dahil daw Malaki daw yung impact ko sa life nya then she said that I was her boyfriend’s greatest love.

Then bigla din nag chat saken yung ex ko na want daw ako I meet ng girlfriend nya because kinuwento nya daw na I'm a good person keme, then they want to visit me here at home to have some coffee daw. Idk why?

So dahil gusto ko ng peace of mind di ako pumayag.
Ayoko na makita ex ko kahit kailan after what he did to me.
My ex is a narcissist and cheater. Ngayon lang kami nagkausap after 8 months of no contact kase never ko talaga sya kinausap after ng break up namin di ako nag paramdam sakanya and ang bilis nyang maka hanap ng iba. 

Then yun nag chat din pala yung Ex ko sa friend kong lalaki. my ex asking my friend kung sino daw boyfriend ko and ano pinagkakaabalahan ko sa buhay kase curious daw sya dahil ang tagal ko daw nawala sa socmed.
Nagpapakilala yung ex ko sa friend ko na 
""ako yung ex ni *my name*"" 
""ako yung ex nya na 3 yrs and may pa putol putol pa""
""Wala naman naging ibang ex yan ako lang.""

Diko alam kung bat curious pa din sya sa life ko kahit may gf na.
Kinausap ko din yung current gf nya na ayoko na makipag kita sa bf nya dahil I'm happy na and pa move forward na din.

Also I told her na sabihin sa ex ko na kalimutan nako dahil i already cut him off in my life.
Pangatlong GF na yan ng EX ko and I don't know why he still keeps reaching out to me.

I'm happy naman for both of them sana tumagal sila.

Not per page. Not per hour. That’s the whole thing.

Why?
I’m just getting started. I want to improve my portfolio, meet interesting people, and prove to myself (and maybe the world) that I can do this. So instead of waiting for “the perfect client,” I’m putting myself out there — ₹500 and full effort.

What I can do:

Clean landing pages for your idea/startup/personal brand

Simple multi-page websites (About, Contact, Services, etc.)

Mobile-friendly, smooth layout, good vibes

Help you set up domain + hosting if you’re lost in tech land

Make it look like you’ve got your act together online 😎

What I can’t do (yet):

Backend stuff (logins, databases, dashboards, etc.)

Fancy web apps or e-commerce sites

Why trust me?
Because I’ll treat your site like it’s my portfolio piece (because it is). That means late nights, pixel-perfect details, and way too much coffee.

DM me. Let’s make something awesome — even if it’s just the beginning.

I used to struggle a lot with depression anxiety and insomnia, so I've since been prescribed seroquel and prozac, and some nights I take melatonin too. I actually sleep now, but the problem is it gets me drowsy and I sleep 8-10 hrs most days, and sometimes still will be yawning throughout the day even if I feel fine.

It's hard for me to get my meds looked after because I don't have a doctor currently, so I don't know if there's more I can be doing or if this is just the way life is for me. It certainly feels better than the alternative where I wasn't sleeping for days on end, and not being able to hold down a job.

But he still gets mad at me and calls me lazy, because I feel like he doesn't understand. I already give him a lot of my time, hours after I'm done my work shifts, and whatever days we both have off we spend it together gaming or talking. This was a text exchange we had today and it's always kinda like this. I've been in abusive relationships in the past and I don't know if I've got blinders on right now or not. I love him but I hate how he always has these problems with me and I never seem to know when they're coming. I'd love some input on whether this seems like normal behavior or not, or if I really am the problem here.

1lhejsl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lhejsl,Again oru solo date,"It’s been a while since I posted here. In that time, I wandered into a few cafés and restaurants, some nice, some ordinary, but nothing ever felt like it deserved a mention. Nothing felt like a “moment.” But yesterday was different.

I was feeling unusually lonely, so I decided to dress up and take myself out. No big plan, just a solo date at a slightly pricey café called Entrance. And you know what? Just sitting there, with no expectations and no one to entertain, felt like such a deep breath after a long day. It reminded me that solitude isn’t always something to escape, it’s something to embrace. It teaches you to care for yourself in the most tender ways. And maybe, just maybe, one day, I’ll take all that care and give it to someone who truly loves me in return.

Isn’t it a little funny how we’re always looking to fall in love? As if that’s the goal. And in chasing that idea, we often forget how much it can hurt us when it doesn’t happen the way we dreamed. We call ourselves unlucky or unloved when maybe we just needed to slow down and stop searching for a while.

There’s no magical twist to this story. I didn’t have some out-of-this-world dish. Just a simple parotta with beef, followed by a soft, sweet tiramisu. It was the vibe, the quiet joy of sitting there, the peacefulness in my own head that made the evening feel special. Later, I went for a night ride near Marina beach—again, nothing extraordinary. Just something that felt good.

This isn’t some once-in-a-lifetime experience or an aesthetic reel-worthy moment. It’s just me, quietly appreciating the little things I’m lucky to have. And honestly? That gratitude made me wake up glowing this morning. Even my coffee tasted better. My mom noticed I looked extra happy. I even feel like tackling all the house chores I’ve been ignoring.

So hey, if you’re feeling alone, don’t be too hard on yourself. There’s something beautifully grounding about being in your own company, no strings attached. Learn to sit with it. Appreciate the quiet. One day, it all adds up to something really good.

Have a calm, happy Sunday. ✨

A big one is playing games I play on PC mostly and I have a switch. My main game is FFXIV currently and I spend most nights either raiding or crafting. I do also farm some mounts from time to time. I also play league moslty TFT but I just have fun running it down on an aram or climbing to gold for my free skin. I have a plethora of multi-player games like Helldivers 2, Stardew Valley, Risk of Rain, and Monster Hunter. I have a lot of other random games and happy to try new ones. I also like pokemon and Mario games as well but don't play those as often anymore. 

I am a huge fan of horror movies and media is often am on the lookout for new hidden gems. Some of my favorites include midsommar, coffee table, where evil lurks, REC and i really could go on. I also enjoy comedy and action films. As for shows I feel like I often go more for documentaries and paranormal type shows. I reallg just like all sorts of spooky stuff and cryptids. Sprinkling in other types of show and anime. I am currently watching a few airing anime like go go loser ranger season 2, kowloon generic romance and witch watch. Always happy to give and take recommendations. 

Going to the gym is a semi hobby/lifestyle change. Have been going for a while and it's been nice I hope to continue and get healthier doing that if you want to talk about gym stuff I'm always down! 


Another of my hobbies is actually a new thing which is building gunpla and I recently got a airbrush so I am hoping to learn how to paint and just generally learn more about this hobby it's been an exciting start. 

There's definitely more about me to learn and I'm happy to answer questions and just chat. I honestly prefer voice chats a lot more since they flow a lot more naturally than texting if you ask me. Oh right I also have pets a cat and a dog will be happy to share pictures of them.

I (44 F) inherited my family home from my father when he passed away. My niece and nephew (both are late 30s) had moved in previously to help care for my dad as he was on hospice. I lived out of state when the had first moved in but I eventually moved back into the family home to care for him as well (my father actually requested that I come home to be with him and I said I would).

My father passed away in a few months ago and they asked if they could stay with me a little longer until they got their housing taken care of. My nephew is disabled and his long term gf (niece) takes care of him. I was still grieving but agreed believing they would vacate soon. 

Anyways onto the topic at hand....

My dad was a daily coffee drinker and had a pretty fancy coffee maker thing-a-ma-jig. I usually use a keurig. I had not used the fancy coffee thing but finding I was out of K Cups, I went to use the fancy thing...only to find that it was gone. I looked around and did not see it. So I went to my niece and asked her where it was. She told me my nephew's oldest sister had come taken it.

I had to pause at that second so I didn't go berserk.  I think she say the look on my face and she quickly said that oldest niece..we will call her Sarah..bought it as a gift for my dad and hers had recently broken so she just took that one back. I asked when did she take it. She could not remember the exact date but said it was fairly recent. I was not home for about two weeks so it had to have been around that time.

I asked he what mad her think that was  okay? I said everything that was in the house was mine with the exception of their belongings. My niece explained that  Sarah may have thought it was okay since she paid for it. I told her that even if the machine was a gift that Sarah taking it was not okay. I told her this was now my house and everything inside was my property (with the exception of their belongings). I also said that it was wrong the let Sarah take the machine without including me in the conversation because now I consider it stealing. My niece just said oh yeah.. I guess that probably would have been best.

Let me just say... since I didn't really use the damn thing if Sarah had spoken to me first.. I would most likely have let her have it. It's the principal of the matter to me. So I've been upset because I feel disrespected. I'm letting you stay in my home and you allowed someone to remove property from my house! 

Am I overreacting since I didn't use the machine much at all? Am I the only one who thinks taking a gift back is wrong? I've been mulling this over since earlier and I don't think I'm wrong. 

So okay redditors...weigh in.....

Excerpt: Back to the Warpath

 

\[Location: Yokota Safe House – Outskirts of Tokyo\]

Time: 0200 Hours

Weather: Rain. Thick. Unrelenting.

Lighting: Fluorescent hum. One bulb flickering.

 

The wind howled like a mourning woman outside the secure compound.

 

Inside, rain traced ghostly fingers down the reinforced glass of the Yokota safe house — once a converted intel station, now a halfway sanctuary for soldiers of God. The place reeked of disinfectant, rain-drenched canvas, and blood that wouldn't wash out of gear bags.

 

Martinez kicked the reinforced door shut behind them. The kitten — nicknamed Yōkai by a child they'd saved — nestled against his chest, indifferent to the war around it.

 

Vega was already in the kitchenette, elbows deep in ration bins. The low hum of a coffee pot sputtering back to life buzzed behind him.

 

Gonzales collapsed onto the battered leather couch with a grunt, joints cracking like rifle bolts.

 

“Bro… I need a nap, a ribeye, and a priest,” he said, eyes half-lidded.

 

Jane stood near the command terminal, silent. Her eyes weren’t on the team — they were watching Lou. He hadn’t said a word since Kayako’s whisper goodbye at the shrine steps. His silence carried weight. The kind that breaks people without ever raising a hand.

 

The hallway door creaked.

 

Medina shuffled in, drenched and red-faced.

 

Martinez zeroed in instantly. “Oh my God, not again. Bro, did the ghost chick flirt with you or what?”

 

Lou arched an eyebrow — a twitch of amusement beneath the stillness. “That’s two cursed women now. You collecting ‘em?”

 

“Bro’s haunted and hot,” Gonzales muttered, pulling his hood up.

 

Vega called from the kitchen, chewing something crunchy. “He’s got that ‘I process trauma through awkward eye contact’ vibe. Women love that.”

 

Medina groaned. “Can we not? She looked at me. That’s all.”

 

“Oh she looked, alright,” Martinez said. “That was the ‘I’m gonna show up in your shower drain’ kinda look.”

 

The room cracked up. Even Lou allowed the smallest of smirks to ghost his face.

 

Then Jane stepped forward — no smile. Just a scorched manila folder in one hand and a USB drive in the other.

 

“It’s here,” she said. “New contact. High-priority drop.”

 

Lou took it without a word. Plugged it into the aging black laptop on the mission crate. The screen flickered to life.

FINAL DIRECTIVE

 

“There is no redemption. No heart beneath the form.

This is not a memory. It is a weapon.”

 

The screen dimmed.

 

The room followed.

 

Martinez crossed his arms, “There’s no saving anyone this time.”

 

Lou shut the laptop and stood.

 

“Then we don’t hold back,” he said. “

 

Martinez cracked his knuckles. “Good. Been dying to get loud.”

 

Medina checked the mag on his sidearm. “No flirting this time. Got it.”

 

“Eight feet tall, bro,” Gonzales muttered. “You’d still flirt.”

 

A ripple of laughter passed through the squad — brief, but real.

 

Then Lou walked toward the weapons crate.

 

He didn’t look back.

 

“This time,” he said, “we’re not chasing ghosts.”

 

Mission Entry: Yokota Unit Deployment. Full blackout begins

 

 

 

Vega (adjusting stock):

“Medina, you attract ghosts like it’s a kink.”

 

Gonzales (laughing):

“Can’t help it, bro. That man blinks, and cursed girls start journaling about him.”

 

Martinez (chuckling as he loads shells):

“I’m just sayin’… if Onryō had a dating app, Medina’s inbox would be full of black hair and bad intentions.”

 

Medina (dry):

“That’s rich coming from y’all. I’m the one getting haunted — you’re the ones making mixtapes about it.”

 

Nolasco:

“He’s got that ‘haunt me, mommy’ energy.”

 

Martinez:

“Kayako almost wrote a fanfic.”

 

Lou (finally speaking, calm and razor-edged):

“Enough. Lock it down. This one isn’t broken. She’s just evil.”

 

Silence follows. Everyone falls into that mission mode — not fear, but readiness.

 

They’ve seen trauma. They’ve fought sorrow.

This is different. This thing? It enjoys it.

 

 

 

Jane, still behind the glass, watches the team finalize their gear. She makes a note in the operations file, cross-checks Lou’s visual maps with local spiritual ley lines, and pauses only once — when Lou looks up.

 

No words. Just understanding.

 

Scene Title: Psalm 13 – “Angels and Echoes”

 

Location: Yokota Air Base, Flight Line – Night

 

Scene Title: Psalm 13 – “Angels and Echoes”

Location: Yokota Air Base – Flight Line – Night

 

\[EXT. YOKOTA AIR BASE – FLIGHT LINE – NIGHT\]

 

The night sky above Yokota is inked in deep navy — clouds rolling slow like ghosts with nowhere to be. The tarmac gleams with a sheen of cold humidity, floodlights cutting long lines of silver across the blacktop.

 

Rows of C-130 Hercules aircraft sit in silence. Giants at rest. Warhorses asleep.

 

And in the stillness stands Lou Phillips — arms folded, jaw set — staring up at one of them like it’s speaking to him in a voice only he remembers.

 

Lou’s POV:

The fuselage. The rivets. The belly gun hatch.

His eyes trace every inch like muscle memory. Like prayer beads.

 

He doesn’t blink when Jane walks up beside him. She knows better than to talk right away.

 

There’s reverence in the air. A hush not even the engines dare break.

 

Jane (softly):

“Beautiful, aren’t they?”

 

Lou (quiet):

“My dad called ’em ugly angels.”

(beat)

“Said they weren’t built to impress. Just built to get people home.”

 

He shifts his gaze to the exhaust vents, the faded stencil of old tail numbers.

 

Lou (cont’d):

“He was a crew chief. These were his religion. I remember the smell of his boots… oil, smoke, jet wash.”

(beat)

“He’d lift me on his shoulders to watch the AC-130 during air shows. Told me, that one’s a beast, son. She doesn’t just fight. She protects.”

 

Jane doesn’t speak. Her gaze follows Lou’s — to the hulking shadow of an AC-130 at the far end of the line. Its silhouette is brutal and holy. A gunship etched in steel.

 

Martinez’s voice cuts in — low, nostalgic, reverent.

 

Martinez (offscreen):

“She still give you chills?”

 

They turn to see him — Martinez stepping forward from the dark. His expression isn’t tough. It’s tender.

 

Martinez:

“That bird saved me once. Mosul. 2007.”

(beat)

“Whole alley lit up with RPGs. Screaming, smoke, blood. Pilot asked if we needed an angel. I told him: Send the loudest one you got.”

 

He stares at the AC-130 like it’s an old friend. A saint with scorched wings.

 

Martinez (cont’d):

“Next thing I hear is that soft whine from the sky. Then—judgment.

Vulcan. Bofors. The kind of fire that doesn’t just kill. It cleanses.”

 

Jane:

“You ever watch it hit?”

 

Martinez (nods):

“Once. And you don’t forget it.

It doesn’t explode.

It ends.

That cannon sings, and the world goes quiet.

It’s not just firepower — it’s finality.”

 

Lou (low):

“My dad used to say… when that thing shows up, it’s because heaven ran out of warnings.”

 

The three of them go quiet again. The AC-130 looms in the dark like a cathedral of violence and mercy. Every bolt and turret is a psalm in steel.

 

Jane (quietly):

“Your dad would’ve been proud of what you built. What you’re doing.”

 

Lou (quietly):

“He’d be proud of the reasons. Not the methods.”

 

A wind moves across the flight line, carrying a faint whiff of grease, ozone, and jet fuel.

 

Martinez (murmured):

“You hear that hum in your bones? That’s what angels sound like… when they’re still deciding.”

 

The AC-130’s lights blink once in the distance.

 

A pulse.

A signal.

 

They stand in silence — not planning, not preparing — just remembering.

 

And then Lou whispers, more to the bird than to either of them:

 

Lou:

“If I die out there, I want it to be under that sound.

Under judgment.

Not in silence.”

 

\[CUT TO BLACK\]

The sky doesn’t answer. But the angels are listening

 

Scene Title: Psalm 13 – “Gifts from Ghosts”

Location: Yokota Air Base – Motor Pool / Equipment Yard – Night

 

\[EXT. YOKOTA MOTOR POOL – NIGHT\]

 

The air is thick with anticipation and the ozone bite of diesel and cold steel. The buzzing floodlights above flicker once—just enough to remind you you’re still on Earth, even if the world beyond is anything but.

 

Lou and the rest of the 13th Psalm squad gather under the glow, boots crunching gravel, breath fogging in the night air. The motor pool feels quieter than it should be — like something holy is about to be unveiled.

 

A tarp-covered shape sits at the center of it all. Big. Broad. Square-shouldered and still.

 

Two techs stand nearby — uniforms rumpled, hands greasy, grins too wide to be standard issue.

 

Vega (tilting his head, hands on hips):

“Please tell me that’s a crate of bourbon and not another haunted antique.”

 

Nolasco (peering over):

“Nah. Haunted bourbon sounds like something Medina would buy off eBay.”

 

Medina (without hesitation):

“You say that like I haven’t.”

 

Tech Chief (stepping up, clipboard under arm):

“Captain Phillips. Sergeant Martinez. You’ve got a gift from the brass — retrofitted under direct authorization.

Consider it a ‘retroactive thank-you’ for… clearing up Saitama.”

 

He doesn’t say what they cleaned up. He doesn’t have to. The blood never fully came out of the rocks.

 

Lou steps forward. His presence is heavy. Not tense — anchored. He gives a slow nod, eyes never blinking.

 

With a single pull from one of the techs, the tarp slides free like a veil from a coffin.

 

The floodlights catch chrome, matte, and steel.

 

Two customized Humvees sit revealed. Matte gunmetal gray, slammed low with aggressive profiles. Armor-plated with reinforced skirts, angled plating, off-road tires thick as a linebacker’s chest.

 

Not just machines. Warhounds.

 

Martinez (half-laugh, half-prayer):

“Holy mother of torque…”

 

Medina (eyeing the suspension):

“They lowered the stance. Look at the springs. That’s battlefield ballet right there.”

 

Gonzales (crouching low, checking under the front):

“Twin intakes. That’s a Duramax heart… and she’s pissed.”

 

Tech Chief (stepping up, proud):

“6.6L Duramax. Twin-turbo. Tuned to pull weight and chew miles. Reinforced axles, run-flat tires, custom military suspension, upgraded armor plating, and climate-control that won’t quit in the Sahara.

You can ram through a brick wall in third gear. Just don’t ask for good mileage.”

 

Lou runs a hand along the hood — fingers trailing the cool steel. He doesn’t smile. But his silence says something. It’s the kind of moment you don’t ruin with words.

 

Lou (quiet, reverent):

“They armored the souls out of these things.”

 

Vega (running his palm across the matte finish):

“She’s beautiful. Looks like she wants to get in a bar fight.”

 

Nolasco (nodding, wide-eyed):

“Call her ‘Road Psalm.’”

 

Tech Chief (gesturing to a small laser-etched plate on the dash):

“Already named. First one’s ‘Psalm XIII.’ Second one’s ‘Silent Mercy.’ Figured it fit your unit.”

 

Jane (appearing quietly at Lou’s side, arms crossed):

“Not bad for government work.”

 

Martinez (to Lou, voice dipping into something nostalgic):

“Your old man ever wrench on stuff like this?”

 

Lou (soft, eyes still on the vehicle):

“Not this mean. But he’d nod at it. Then tell me it needed a good exhaust bleed.”

 

Gonzales (already halfway into the passenger side):

“Aux works. We are not listening to Vega’s damn 90s R&B again.”

 

Vega (already defensive):

“You will and you’ll like it. Boyz II Men got us through Kandahar.”

 

Medina (grinning):

“Can we stencil ghosts on the doors?”

 

Martinez (without missing a beat):

“No. But we’re naming the fifty-cal ‘Gospel.’”

 

The squad erupts with laughter, genuine and feral — not just at the joke, but at the fact they can laugh. Here. Now. Surrounded by steel blessings and the hum of war.

 

Lou steps back, taking it all in — the smell of new tires, the vapor trails from the still-warm engines, the way his team moves like they were made for this moment.

 

Lou (under his breath):

“…Yeah. These’ll do.”

 

From the shadows, Jane watches him — not with pity, not with worry — but with something closer to awe.

 

She sees the battle lines inside him.

The grief that never settled.

The love he still carries like a cross.

 

Tonight, they weren’t just given vehicles.

 

They were given gifts from ghosts.

 

\[EXT. FLIGHT LINE – SHORTLY AFTER\]

 

The two Humvees idle, loaded, engines purring like lions waiting to be unleashed.

 

Inside: holy men in Kevlar and scars.

Outside: the road ahead.

Ahead: things that don’t bleed normal.

 

But now — with these warhorses rumbling beneath them — they aren’t just going into the dark.

(Excerpt from the Kayako Interlude)

 

 

 

\[Day 1 — 7:12 PM\]

 

The house no longer groaned beneath the weight of its past.

 

No more screams in the walls.

No more fingers scratching from under floorboards.

No more blood pooling beneath doorways like it had a mind of its own.

 

It was quiet now.

 

Still scarred.

Still soaked in tragedy.

 

But quiet.

 

The kind of quiet that didn’t feel dead—just tired.

 

The squad worked in near silence, moving with the same reverence they might’ve shown in a field burial. They didn’t speak much, not because of fear, but because of what had happened here. Because of what they’d seen Lou do. Because of who they’d seen standing in the hallway afterward.

 

Medina swept ash and soot from the buckled floorboards, muttering prayers in Spanish under his breath.

Martinez found an old curtain in a sealed room and hung it up across a cracked window, shaking his head like a man patching up a wound that would never close.

Vega and Gonzales fumbled in the basement, trying to fix the power. They cursed and joked about haunted wiring and “cursed-ass Japanese breakers,” doing everything they could to make the moment feel normal.

 

But it wasn’t them who brought the lights back.

 

It was Toshio.

 

A small, pale hand flicked the breaker with a boyish grin.

 

And the power hummed back to life.

 

The bulbs flickered once, twice—then held.

 

Then Toshio laughed.

 

Not a whisper. Not a death rattle.

 

A real laugh.

 

A child’s laugh.

 

And in that one sound—pure, warm, human—something inside each man broke open.

 

The ice around their hearts cracked, the tension uncoiled, and something resembling peace seeped into the edges of the room.

 

They cooked dinner with what little they had: ground meat, instant buns, a pack of seasoned drumsticks. Vega dug up spices from his rucksack, grinning like a proud uncle.

 

“Time for some soul food,” he said.

 

He handed the bowl to Toshio, showing him how to season the chicken, slapping his hand away when the boy got too generous with the cayenne.

 

“We’re making Nashville hot, not nuclear,” Vega laughed.

 

Gonzales chased him through the hallway when he stole a half-cooked slider off the tray, laughing like a big brother who didn’t care about ghost stories anymore.

Even Martinez, always so hard, so blistering with rage, handed Toshio a little folded paper ninja star. He knelt beside him and whispered:

 

“You’re tougher than most adults I’ve met, little man. You’re still here. That matters.”

 

Kayako never left his side.

 

She didn’t crawl.

She didn’t twist.

She didn’t drag herself with that terrible, bone-crunching sound.

 

She simply stood behind him, her posture regal, arms gently folded—watchful. Protective. A mother no longer twisted by hate, but anchored by love.

 

She didn’t speak.

 

But she didn’t have to.

 

The house was still, because she allowed it.

 

Lou sat alone on the back steps, the wood beneath him damp from old rot and recent rain. His elbows rested on his knees, hands stained with old blood and dust, eyes fixed on the distant tree line.

 

The sun was setting, casting a blood-orange hue across the hills.

 

Jane sat beside him. Quiet. No words at first. Just her presence.

 

Inside, she could hear Vega cussing about oil temperatures, Gonzales howling with laughter, and Toshio calling out names in broken English as he tried to hand everyone a plate.

 

Kayako stood just within view.

 

Lou saw it too.

 

He never stopped seeing it.

 

“You don’t trust it,” Jane said, watching him.

 

Lou’s jaw clenched.

 

His fingers curled into fists, then loosened.

 

“She doesn’t deserve a cage of pain,” he said, finally. His voice was thick. Strained.

“But we let it happen. All of us.”

 

Jane turned, studying his face—not just the soldier, but the man beneath.

 

“You’re talking about the movies,” she said.

 

Lou nodded slowly, like his neck weighed a hundred pounds.

 

“They took her death,” he said, staring ahead. “Her pain. Her son. Everything she was. And they turned it into a fucking franchise.

 

They put it in theaters. Mocked it. Jump-scared it.

 

I watched ’em. Laughed at the kills. Jumped at the noise.

 

I didn’t care.

 

Just another ghost story.”

 

His voice cracked.

He hadn’t cried in years.

But now, his shoulders trembled.

 

“She was real,” he whispered.

“They were real.”

 

Jane didn’t say anything.

 

She just leaned in. Rested her head gently against his shoulder, her warmth quiet and unwavering. Her presence didn’t fix it.

 

But it helped.

 

Inside, the laughter rose again.

 

Toshio had accidentally spilled chili oil down Gonzales’ arm, and Vega howled that this was “the ghost of hot chicken vengeance.”

 

Even Kayako tilted her head.

 

Watching.

 

Still.

 

Lou didn’t smile. But he softened.

 

He looked toward the doorway.

 

Kayako stood there. Silent. Staring. Not in rage.

 

In memory.

 

Still facing the one room she hadn’t moved from since she returned.

 

The room where it all happened.

 

Where she died.

Where she screamed.

Where the world forgot she was a person.

 

“She’s still standing in front of the room,” Lou whispered. “The one where it happened.”

 

Jane’s voice was soft.

 

“Go to her.”

—

 

\[7:51 PM — Upstairs\]

 

The hallway was still.

The air clung to Lou's skin—not cold, but heavy, like it remembered everything that had ever happened here.

Blood spilled. Bones broken. A mother’s final breath echoing like a curse.

 

Kayako stood before the door like a statue carved from sorrow.

 

She didn’t tremble.

She didn’t growl.

She simply existed—anchored to that room like her soul was threaded through the wood.

 

Lou stepped up beside her.

 

There was no fear in his walk. No judgment in his presence.

Just a man with blood on his knuckles and grief in his chest.

 

“I’m sorry,” he said.

 

That was all.

 

No fanfare. No dramatic pause. Just the words she had never heard. The words that should’ve come decades ago. The words she never thought she'd receive from a living soul.

 

“I’m sorry for what you went through,” Lou continued. His voice was low. Almost reverent.

“I’m sorry they filmed it. Branded it. Turned your screams into box office soundtracks.

 

I’m sorry I laughed.

 

I’m sorry I called you ‘creepy.’

 

I’m sorry I didn’t care.”

 

Kayako turned her head toward him. Slowly.

 

Her eyes weren’t filled with rage. They weren’t voids of black malice anymore.

 

They were tired.

They were mother’s eyes.

 

And they held grief.

 

But also… understanding.

 

She opened the door.

 

But didn’t step through.

 

Not until Lou reached out—hands trembling—and gently took hers.

 

Her fingers were cool. Not freezing. Not dead.

Just cool, like porcelain in winter.

 

Together, they stepped into the room.

 

It was small.

 

Quiet.

 

The blood was long gone.

The carpets were frayed and faded.

The bed had collapsed in on itself, nothing more than a splintered frame and mold-stained mattress.

 

But the weight—the pain—lingered.

It clung to the corners like cobwebs made of sorrow.

 

They moved slowly, not to avoid stirring spirits, but out of respect.

Like mourners in a mausoleum.

 

Lou found an old blanket, mildewed and thin, and folded it with hands still stained from battle.

Kayako peeled away a curtain that had turned to powder at the touch. She let it fall, light breaking through the grime-streaked window.

 

Then she knelt in front of an old drawer. The wood creaked like it remembered her hands.

 

She opened it.

Carefully.

Tenderly.

 

Inside was a piece of paper. Crumpled at the corners, yellowed with age.

 

A drawing.

 

Toshio’s, no doubt.

 

A childlike sketch of a red figure with huge black eyes. His father? A monster? Or just what he felt inside?

 

She stared at it like she was holding a piece of her son’s heartbeat.

 

Lou sat across from her, his knees cracking as he lowered himself to the floor. His hands shook so violently he had to press them into his thighs.

 

“I liked the movies,” he said. The words stung coming out.

“Even after the military. Even after I knew better. I still liked them.

 

Kayako replied:

 

Sadako… I liked that one. She reminded me of me.

 

Crawling out of a place no one wants to look. Silent. Angry. Alone.”

 

He chuckled dryly.

 

Then it cracked.

 

A smile that shattered into a sob.

 

Kayako looked up at him.

 

And then, without crawling or screeching or twitching her neck—

 

She touched his face.

 

Her hand was soft.

Human.

 

Not cursed.

 

Not monstrous.

 

“There’s something in your eyes,” she whispered—her voice, fragile and brittle

“I saw it in Toshio... the night he watched me die.”

 

“The look of a child losing his mother.”

 

Lou’s breath caught.

 

His jaw clenched.

His eyes welled.

 

But she didn’t let him fall into it.

 

“You gave him back something I never could,” she continued.

“You let a child be a child again.

You gave me two days… two real days… to hold my son.”

 

Her voice trembled. But it held.

 

And then—finally—she embraced him.

 

Not as a ghost.

 

Not as a legend.

 

Not as a cursed icon reduced to a screen scream.

 

But as a mother.

 

Lou let go.

All of it.

 

The screams.

The fire.

The sound of his brother’s laughter the night his life ended.

The weight of every child they couldn’t save.

 

He collapsed into her arms and wept.

 

And for the first time since he was twelve…

Lou Phillips was comforted.

 

Not by revenge.

Not by victory.

 

But by the simple grace of being held.

 

. \[8:40 PM — Dinner Table\]

 

The old dining table creaked under the weight of mismatched plates, steaming bowls of noodles, and piles of grilled meat, more preparation than lunch with. Miso soups, sushi, and whit rice laid out across. Chicken legs glistened with Vega’s signature Nashville glaze because Toshio couldn’t get enough.

 

The lights above flickered — but stayed on.

 

Toshio sat between Vega and Gonzales, gleefully slurping spicy noodles, noodles that dribbled down his chin and onto his shirt. He didn’t care. He was smiling. A big, messy, open-mouthed grin. His cheeks were stuffed like a chipmunk's.

 

“Alright, lil’ man,” Gonzales said between bites, grinning like a hyena, “Repeat after me. Pinche cabrón.”

 

“GONZALES,” Jane snapped from across the table, glaring like a tired teacher with no time for class clowns.

 

Toshio blinked innocently… and then repeated it, perfectly.

 

Everyone burst into laughter.

 

Martinez nearly choked on his beer, slapping the table hard enough to rattle the plates.

 

“Don’t you dare blame me if this kid starts cussing out the afterlife,” Jane warned, pointing her fork.

 

“Hey, man’s gotta learn,” Gonzales said, raising his cup. “Better Spanish than Latin, right?”

 

“¡Eso!” Vega cheered, clinking his fork against Gonzales’ can.

 

Medina leaned over, whispering to Toshio like a co-conspirator.

 

“Don’t listen to them. You wanna impress a girl, just call her mi tormenta peligrosa. Works every time.”

 

“Medina tried to flirt with a spirit!” Gonzales yelled mid-bite.

 

“SHE SMILED FIRST!” Medina shot back, nearly knocking over the hot sauce bottle.

 

Even Kayako laughed—giggled, really—covering her mouth with delicate fingers, eyes wide in surprise at herself. The sound was fragile and beautiful, like glass wind chimes swaying in forgotten wind.

 

“I grew up hearing stories of the Slit-Mouthed Woman,” she said softly, still smiling. “She was always terrifying. But apparently… flirty?”

 

“I DO NOT want to talk about it,” Medina groaned, hiding his face behind his plate as everyone roared.

 

Martinez, already three beers deep and red in the cheeks, launched into a half-drunk rant about the cursed breaker box.

 

“This place doesn’t run on wires. It runs on emotional trauma. I’ve bled on less dangerous shit in Fallujah!”

 

Toshio pointed at him, wide-eyed, and mimicked, “Trauma!”

 

Everyone laughed harder. Vega fell back in his chair. Jane actually snorted.

 

Then Kayako turned to Lou.

 

Her smile softened, her voice quieted.

 

“Would you like to lead the prayer?”

 

Lou looked at her. She wasn’t a specter anymore. She was a mother. A guest. A woman who had finally been seen.

 

He nodded.

 

Pushed his chair back.

 

And stood.

 

The laughter faded. The squad followed suit, lowering heads, folding hands. Even Toshio did it, copying Gonzales with his eyes half-closed.

 

Lou spoke. His voice wasn’t booming. It didn’t have to be.

 

It was steady. Reverent. Worn from battles no one should survive.

 

“Lord,” he began,

“We’ve seen darkness that should never have been born.

We’ve walked through the valley of the shadow, and we’ve seen the faces of the lost.

But tonight… we give thanks.

 

For breath in our lungs.

For laughter in this house.

For second chances.

And for a boy who can still smile.

 

Bless this food.

Bless this time.

And bless these final hours.”

 

He opened his eyes.

 

“Amen.”

 

“Amen,” the squad echoed.

 

A beat of peace settled over them.

 

And then—chaos.

 

Martinez reached across the table to grab more chicken and knocked over Medina’s drink.

 

“Bro!” Medina shouted. “That was my soda!”

 

“Cry more, maybe Kayako’ll hug you again,” Martinez fired back.

 

Toshio giggled uncontrollably, his entire body shaking with joy. He leaned against Vega’s arm, full and sleepy, like a puppy after playtime.

 

Kayako sat down beside him, ruffling his hair gently. She looked around the table—these hardened men, this killer of monsters, this sharp-eyed woman who protected her son like a blade—and smiled.

 

There was warmth here.

 

There was light.

 

\[Later That Night — Kayako’s Journal Entry\]

 

The room was dim, lit only by a bedside lantern and the quiet hum of night outside.

 

The paper was old, the ink faded in places. But her hand—once trembling, once warped by rage—moved smoothly across the page.

 

Tonight, we shared a meal.

Toshio laughed. I laughed. We all did.

 

The soldiers who risked their lives for strangers… they mocked each other like brothers.

They prayed.

They passed the chicken.

 

\*One of them cried in my arms. One of them made my son feel safe.

 

I thought I was a ghost.\*

 

Tonight… I felt human.

 

She paused, her eyes misting, and added:

 

Lou. Jane. Vega. Martinez. Gonzales. Nolasco. Medina.

 

And beside Medina’s name, she drew a little heart.

 

A thank-you for making her son laugh.

 

Toshio peeked over her shoulder, reading upside down, and giggled.

 

“Medina has a girlfriend!” he sang in that sing-song tone that kids always use to weaponize joy.

 

Kayako raised a brow at him, mock-serious.

 

“You’re grounded.”

 

Toshio just laughed harder and threw a crumpled napkin at her.

 

She smiled.

 

The house still bore its scars.

The walls still whispered now and then.

 

But laughter echoed louder.

 

She had 47 hours left.

 

But tonight?

 

Tonight was enough

 

Psalm 13 — “A Mother’s Goodbye”

(Excerpt: The Final 24 Hours)

 

\[Day 2 — 1:06 PM\]

Sunlight filtered through the Saeki house like a baptism.

 

It didn’t drip or shine — it poured, washed, purified. The once-rotted hallway now smelled faintly of warm air and aged wood, not blood and regret. The walls no longer whispered. They listened.

 

Toshio sprinted through the corridor barefoot, laughter trailing behind him like ribbons. In his arms, clutched tight to his chest, was a ragged white kitten. Small. Starving. One ear crumpled, but its eyes sparkled with the stubbornness of life.

 

“Where’d you get that?” Vega asked, leaning back on the arm of the couch, sipping reheated coffee.

 

Martinez, chewing on a toothpick, crossed his arms.

 

“Found it curled under the truck. Looked like hell. Figured the kid needed a partner in crime.”

 

“So you just stole a cat?” Gonzales asked.

 

“Nah,” Martinez grinned. “I recruited it.”

 

Lou watched it all from the porch — silent, unmoving, the way mountains watch weather change. The filtered gold light cast long shadows across his face, making the scars there look like they belonged to someone else.

 

Toshio ran up to him, the kitten squirming in his arms.

 

Lou knelt slowly, eye-level with the boy.

 

Toshio pointed at Lou’s arm, the tattoos, the muscle beneath them. “Why you so big?”

 

Lou raised an eyebrow. “You wanna find out?”

 

Toshio nodded with that earnestness only a child can pull off.

 

Lou flexed. Slowly. Deliberately.

 

Toshio gasped, slapped both hands on Lou’s arm. “Like a rock!”

 

Lou laughed — not the clipped, tired huff he’d perfected over the years, but a deep, aching sound that sounded like it hadn’t come out in over a decade.

 

And then he hoisted Toshio off the ground and spun him once, the boy shrieking with joy, legs kicking wildly. The kitten meowed like a tiny war protestor.

 

Behind them, Kayako stood in the doorway, the wind brushing through her hair. She looked not like a ghost, but like a widow watching her child meet a man who might one day become a father.

 

\[2:34 PM — The Mirror\]

Medina passed a mirror  in the hallway.

 

She was there.

 

But she was… different now.

 

No blood. No snarl. Just faint, pinkish scars. Her eyes, no longer mirrors of violence, were exhausted.

 

“You’re different,” he said softly.

 

“I’m healing,” she replied.

 

Medina stood straighter. Guarded. “You came back to flirt again?”

 

She smiled — shy, even. “I came to say thank you.”

 

“What now?” he asked, genuinely unsure.

 

“Not yet. But soon.”

 

She leaned close, her voice warm.

 

“I liked what I saw.”

 

And then she was gone.

 

Behind him, Gonzales had seen everything.

 

“Bro. BRO.”

 

Medina turned red. “I don’t want to talk about it.”

 

\[4:45 PM — The Porch\]

Jane and Kayako sat side by side.

 

Toshio played nearby, using sticks to build a tiny fort for his kitten.

 

“You don’t have to go,” Jane said.

 

Kayako’s smile was small but steady. “My bones are still upstairs. I’m just a whisper stretched too far. But for now… I’m whole enough to say goodbye.”

 

Jane’s voice cracked. “But you have him.”

 

Kayako’s eyes were far away. “That’s why I have to go. If I stay, he fades with me. But now… now he has a future.”

 

She glanced toward Lou, who stood by a rusted fence post, arms folded, scanning the horizon.

 

“Your Lou… he carries too much.”

 

Jane didn’t speak. Didn’t need to.

 

Kayako continued. “When I was cursed, I forgot things. Faces. Words. But I remember mirrors. The way they caught things the world couldn’t.”

 

She leaned forward.

 

“There was one mirror. In the attic. When it all happened. I saw… him in it.”

 

Jane’s fingers curled into her palms. “Jeff.”

 

Kayako nodded.

 

“The smiling man. Something in him twisted the curse deeper. He fed it.”

 

Her voice dropped.

 

“But Lou? The mirror flinched from him. Whatever darkness grips this world… it hates Jeff. And it fears Lou.”

 

Jane stared, stunned.

 

“Why?”

 

Kayako smiled gently. “Because even in ruin, Lou still tries. Still lifts others. Still guards light he doesn't believe he's worthy of. That kind of soul?” She paused. “It breaks things that feed on suffering.”

 

\[8:06 PM — The Final Dinner\]

Sunset bled orange and violet through the windows.

 

The squad gathered around the old table. Someone had found mismatched chairs from the shed. The kitten sat on Toshio’s lap, stealing crumbs.

 

Lou led the prayer — voice calm, reverent.

 

“Lord,

For every shadow we’ve seen… we thank You for the light.

For every broken heart… we thank You for the moments they beat whole.

And for this child…

who laughs.

Bless this food, this time, and these last hours.

Amen.”

 

“Amen,” they echoed.

 

Then Toshio grinned. “Dessert!”

 

He served MRE chocolate syrup over crushed rice crackers.

 

“American sushi!” he shouted proudly.

 

Everyone gagged.

 

Kayako laughed — a real, uncontrollable burst.

 

“That’s my boy,” she said.

 

Vega raised his canteen. “To haunted homies.”

 

Lou added, solemn and proud, “To mothers.”

 

They toasted.

 

\[10:49 PM — The Goodbye\]

The house was quiet again.

 

Not like before. Not dead. Just still.

 

In the living room, each member of 13th Psalm stood in line.

 

Martinez patted Toshio’s head, his gruff voice softer than usual. “You’re a tough little warrior.”

 

Then he kissed Kayako’s hand — an old soldier’s respect.

 

Vega bowed deeply. “You raised a good one.”

 

Gonzales grinned. “Gonna miss this chaos demon.”

 

Medina stepped forward. Kayako eyed him with a smirk.

 

“Handsome,” she said.

 

Medina choked. “Y-Yeah. Uh… thanks?”

 

She winked again.

 

Jane stepped in. Her eyes wet.

 

“Are you sure?”

 

“I’m ready.”

 

Finally, Lou.

 

Kayako stepped close, touched his face again. Her hands were warm.

 

“You gave me peace,” she said.

 

Lou swallowed hard. “You gave me something I didn’t know I needed.”

 

She nodded.

 

Then turned to Toshio, knelt, and whispered something soft and sacred in his ear.

 

He hugged her tightly.

 

Then they walked — together — down the hallway.

 

No screams.

No curse.

Just fading light.

And peace.

 

The kitten meowed once, then curled in Martinez’s lap like it had always belonged there.

 

Silence settled.

 

But not sorrow.

 

\[Final Scene — Later That Night\]

Kayako’s journal sat open on the table. Her last entry.

 

Tonight, I was a mother.

Tonight, he was a child.

They gave us something no curse ever could.

Time.

I see now — even the cursed can find comfort.

Even the damned… can be loved.

 

At the bottom of the page was a hand-drawn heart.

 

Inside it:

Lou. Jane. Vega. Martinez. Gonzales. Medina. Nolasco. Toshio.

 

And above all of it… a small doodle of a mirror.

 

Shattered.

Reading some of the material on this sub’s sidebar or whatever I was struck with a certain point that children can’t qualify as having DPD as it’s fairly normal for a child to be dependent on family. While I’m no child, I’m not sure how dependent on my family I should be at the moment. I’m 19, 20 in a month or so. Currently I’m living away from them but they essentially just pay for my entire life. I can’t really work up the motivation to try and find a job, the last attempt at that resulted in a really nasty meltdown that was ultimately over nothing. 

My parents are fairly distant now is the thing? It’s not as if we talk a lot, or are as close or even enmeshed as we were before. My dad doesn’t hardly ever talk to me for anything besides practical stuff, and my mom is in in contact a bit more though I always get the impression she’s kind of just desperately scrambling for any sort of time to connect with me- she’s made and carried out plans with me that are a bit nonsensical (maybe I’m overreacting, the most weird was going out for coffee at like 5)

I don’t feel very dependent on anyone at the moment is also the thing. Since all my friends are kind of out of my life (summer, and everyone’s gone home since we’re all college students), I feel like I’ve just sort of… broke? Like, at first I was in a lot of pain because the people I needed so desperately weren’t around, but after a lot of tears and pain I kind of just don’t feel much of anything, I’m kind of just progressing the days and failing to make the changes I swore I’d make over the summer. And I’m at least recently remarkably okay with barely ever speaking to anyone and being alone.

The indications I have for DPD are: I feel really fixated on how I used to be useful to others (in ridiculously self-sacrificing ways), I’m extremely bad at being alone a lot of the time, most of my dreams tend to be nightmares that revolve around somewhat unpleasant scenarios where I’m left on my own to work it out, and I feel driven to do really extreme things for attention.

So sorry for the long post. Should I explore the possibility I have DPD more? I think it’s most likely that I have borderline since I feel I line up more with the fears of abandonment and weird intense emotions. But DPD seems like, more realistic somehow.

After years of chasing the perfect bean from indie roasters, and large brands alike, (and ending up with a cupboard full of expensive, disappointing coffee 30-40% of the time!), I've finally found my muse in the most unexpected place: Costco.

I usually stick to smaller batches from specialty roasters, or big bags from well known brands but decided to take a punt on their Kirkland Signature Colombian beans yesterday, and wow. Just wow.

I've always been impressed with Kirkland products, but these blew my expectations out of the water, especially at £12/kg!

 * Zero harshness
 * Incredible depth of flavor

This is just my humble opinion, but I'm so genuinely impressed I had to share.

Rain greeted them.

 

Their contact—a woman in her forties named Aiko Suda, formerly with Tokyo PD—met them curbside. Her tone was respectful

 

“Ill drive you to Yokota air base” As they loaded into black vans, Vega looked out at the mist creeping over the high-rises.

 

“This place feels… sad.”

 

Martinez added, “Get ready, boys. We ain’t in Arizona anymore.”

Lou’s reflection flickered in the glass, eyes locked forward.

Something ancient was waiting.

And it wasn’t afraid of them.

 

Scene: Yokota Air Base – Officer Housing, Late Night

 

A cold rain tapped the windshield as the military van pulled past the gates of Yokota. Security gave a quick nod to Martinez—who returned it with a two-finger salute and a grin.

 

“I saved the CO from getting caught cheating on a PT test back in the day,” Martinez explained with a shrug. “Dude owes me his life. Or at least his house.”

The squad filed Into a spacious, well-maintained officer home tucked at the edge of the base. The walls were lined with old samurai artwork and baseball memorabilia. The place smelled like cedar and coffee.

Nolasco dropped his gear. “A whole-ass house? Damn, Top. Usually we get a broom closet and a cot in the janitor’s shed.” Gonzales wandered into the kitchen. “Yo, this guy has a rice cooker that talks.” Vega, looking through the sliding glass door, pointed to the mist creeping over the trees beyond the base fence. “Yeah, it talks all right. Probably curses you too.”

 

Lou walked the perimeter first. Windows. Doors. Lines of sight. His mind ticked like a metronome.

 

He stopped by a small Shinto shrine just outside the back gate.

A fox mask hung on the edge. He stared at it a moment. “Probably decorative,” Medina muttered. Lou didn’t answer. He kept walking.

 

 

 

Squad Living Room, Later That Night

 

The squad was sprawled out. Vega tuned the TV to an old Japanese wrestling channel. They watched in silence as a masked wrestler got body-slammed through a table.

Martinez leaned over to Jane, handing her a warm canned coffee from a vending stash. “Most haunted vending machines on Earth, I swear. Anyway welcome to Yokota. You ain’t in the doghouse here.”

 

Jane gave a slight smile. “Thanks.”

 

Martinez nodded, serious for once. “Ghosts or not—we’re still soldiers. Don’t forget that.”

 

She sipped, eyes flicking to Lou—still outside, standing in the rain. Looking at something  beyond the base walls.

 

 

 

Outside – Rain Drizzling, Lou Alone

 

Lou stood in the dark, breathing slow. He could feel something watching. Not hostile—just curious. Ancient. He muttered under his breath: “We’re here now. Whatever you are… we’ll see you soon.” Lightning cracked in the distance.

Looking for ghosts: 

 

Lou gathered his team in the meeting room ""I need each of you to travel to Tokyo for this mission,"" he began, ""Once you arrive, engage with the locals—strike up conversations in cafes, and visit markets, and . Your goal is to gather as much information as you can about any immediate threats that could affect us.""

 

He paused for a moment, making eye contact with each team member. ""Remember, the key to our success is to be authentic. Approach this mission as if you are part of the community—listen actively to the people you meet and learn from their experiences. Their insights may reveal  details that we can't uncover from a distance.""

 

Scene: Streets of Tokyo – Late Evening

 

The team spread out across the alley-strewn districts of Shinjuku and Koenji. The smell of grilled yakitori, diesel, and rain saturated the air. Neon lights buzzed above them, illuminating the night in colors that felt both alive and surreal.

 

Vega leaned against a rail while munching on a skewer. A group of Japanese college girls passed by, giggling and whispering behind their hands as they looked back at him.

 

“Kakkoii…” one of them murmured, her cheeks flushing red.

 

Vega looked around, confused. “That… was about me?”

 

A vendor nearby grinned. “They said you’re cool. You are… a handsome man!”

 

Vega laughed nervously. “Man, I’m married. I have three kids and a mortgage. You all have the wrong dude.”

 

\---

 

\*\*Nearby – Local Baseball Park\*\*

 

Gonzales was tossing a ball with a group of kids on a dimly lit diamond. Their laughter echoed through the alley walls. One of the boys tried to pitch a fastball to him—Gonzales cracked it into the net.

 

“Sugoi!” they shouted. Gonzales just smiled, sweat glinting on his forehead.

 

“You guys ever see the Cubs play?” he asked.

 

The kids all shook their heads.

 

“You will. One day,” he grinned.

 

\---

 

\*\*Meanwhile – A Quiet Shrine Alley\*\*

 

Lou and Jane had stumbled into a tucked-away alley near an old Buddhist shrine. Paper lanterns swayed above them. An elderly man sat on a bench nearby, a long pipe between his fingers, dressed in soft brown robes.

 

“You two don’t look like tourists,” he said in perfect English.

 

Lou gave a respectful nod. “We’re… looking for someone. Or something.”

 

The old man chuckled. “You’ll find more than what you came for. But tell me… are you seeking justice or escape?”

 

Jane tilted her head. “What’s the difference?”

 

“Intent,” the man replied, his eyes flicking to Lou. “Some hunt to punish. Others to understand. Only one path ends in peace.”

 

Lou listened intently. The old man’s gaze was steady and ancient. There was something behind his eyes that suggested he knew more than he let on.

 

Jane stood beside him silently, watching Lou absorb every word.

 

\---

 

\*\*Elsewhere – Behind a Shady Bar\*\*

 

Martinez stood beside two Yakuza men in sharp suits, their tattoos peeking out from under their sleeves. They smoked and sipped cheap whiskey behind a ramen shop.

 

“So,” Martinez said, “these ghost stories—what’s real?”

 

One of the men, his face half-covered by a dragon tattoo, exhaled smoke. “A woman with a slit mouth. She asks if you think she’s beautiful.”

 

The second added, “Wrong answer, and she’ll cut you to match. But she’s not just a ghost. She’s cursed. Angry.” Martinez scratched his chin. “I’ve pissed off worse. Appreciate the tip.” He paid for the men's drinks and shook their hands.

 

\---

 

\*\*Finally – Dark Alley Near Koenji Station\*\*

 

Medina wandered, following an odd whistle. It was melodic. Familiar?

 

A woman stepped from the shadows, wearing a red mask over her lower face.

 

“Kirei?” she asked in a voice like silk.

 

Medina froze.

 

“I asked… am I beautiful?”

 

She removed the mask, revealing a gruesome, Joker-like smile carved from ear to ear.

 

Medina reached for his weapon—

 

—but she vanished.

 

Only the faint sound of the wind and the distant hum of lanterns remained.

 

 

Cut to: Rooftop – Squad Reconnect Point

 

They regrouped as the moon rose. Lou had his arms crossed, thinking about the old man’s words.

 

Martinez lit a cigarette. “We’ve got our lead.”

 

Gonzales was still carrying a baseball glove.

 

Vega looked spooked. “The girls asked for my Instagram.”

 

Jane stood next to Lou, quieter now. Focused.

 

Medina? He just looked… shaken.

 

“Medina,” Lou asked. “You good?”

 

“…She smiled at me, man. Something’s coming.”

 

Lou’s jaw clenched. “Then we hit first.”

 

Scene: Yokota Safehouse – Briefing Room

 

A storm drummed lightly on the rooftop. Inside, the lights buzzed over the table as the squad gathered. A case file lay open at the center — yellowed police reports, grainy photos, and mythological notes printed on glossy pages.

 

Lou stood at the head of the table, arms crossed. His eyes scanned the room. Jane sat quietly, observing. Medina, though a little pale, rocked in his chair, chewing on a toothpick.

 

Vega muttered, “All this for one chick?”

 

Medina shot back, “You weren’t the one who saw her smile.”

 

Lou finally spoke. “Here’s what we know.”

 

He tapped the file.

 

 

 

Case File: Kuchisake-onna – “The Slit-Mouthed Woman”

 

Origin: Japanese urban legend dated back to the Heian period, though modern sightings began around the 1970s.

 

Description: Appears as a woman in a surgical or demon-style mask. She asks a single question: “Do you think I’m beautiful?”

 

Response Triggers:

 

If yes, she removes her mask and asks again. A wrong or hesitant answer results in her slashing the victim’s mouth to mimic her own.

 

If no, the result is usually immediate death.

 

Abilities: Supernatural speed. Possible teleportation or manipulation of perception. Victims are often found mutilated or vanish completely.

 

Weaknesses (Unconfirmed): Old folklore claims certain answers or candies (like hard caramel) distract her momentarily. Some theories suggest she is tethered to a trauma site.

 

Lou looked at Medina. “You sure it was her?”

 

Medina nodded. “Red coat, weird mask, voice like a hot anime villain, then boom—BAM!—full Glasgow grin.” He paused, shrugged. “Honestly? Kinda hot. I mean, not wife material, but… y’know. Unholy smash, maybe?”

 

Gonzales choked on his drink. “You’re cooked, bro.”

 

Martinez smirked. “Of all of us, she picks Medina.”

 

“Because I got riz,” Medina smirked. “And apparently a death wish.”

 

Vega raised a brow. “You gonna be alright?”

 

Medina shrugged. “I got freaked out, yeah. But I’ve been stalked before. Once by an ex. Once by an insurgent with no legs. I’ll live.”

 

Lou: “We’re thinking bait.”

 

Everyone turned.

 

Medina raised a hand. “Boom. Me.”

 

Jane leaned forward. “You’d use yourself to lure her?”

 

“Hell yeah. Masked girl with knife trauma? Sounds like my last Tinder date.”

 

Martinez chuckled. “Alright, Deadpool, don’t get sliced.”

 

Lou, still calm but firm, nodded. “We’ll control the area. Medina walks the same path, same time. We’ll set up around him. If she shows, we contain.”

 

Vega: “And if she doesn’t?”

 

Lou: “Then we keep trying. This thing’s smart. And watching. Let’s give her what she wants.”

 

 

 

Scene closes on Medina looking at a photo of her in the file — a blurry shot where only half her mutilated face is visible. He exhales and mutters, “You better take me to dinner first.”

 

Scene: Tokyo – Late Night Alleyway, Set for the Bait Mission

 

The alley was narrow, sickly yellow light bleeding down from a flickering streetlamp above. Damp brick walls rose on either side, tagging from generations of hands both living and lost. Everything was too quiet. Even the usual city hum was gone — like the block had been swallowed by something older.

 

Lou adjusted his earpiece from the rooftop. “Medina. You good?”

 

Medina: “Peachy. Might get murdered by a ghost in ten, but vibes are immaculate.”

 

Lou sighed. “Jane’s with you?”

 

Jane (over comms): “Affirmative. Just walking. No action. I promised.”

 

She and Medina strolled down the alley slowly, the silence broken only by their boots scuffing the pavement. Jane’s eyes darted constantly. Something in the shadows made her skin prickle — an instinct not quite human.

 

Jane (low): “The air… it’s thick. Like syrup.”

 

Medina didn’t reply. His eyes flicked toward the deeper dark ahead. Then, suddenly, Jane’s head turned.

 

Jane: “Did you hear that?”

 

She peered into the dim mouth of an intersecting alley. Nothing. Just crushed cans and a flickering vending machine.

 

But when she turned back to Medina…

 

Medina’s shirt was already off.

 

She didn’t say anything. Just blinked.

 

Jane (dryly): “…Are you allergic to fabric or something?”

 

Medina: “Look, statistically speaking, if I die tonight, I’m not going out in a tight tee. Plus, ghosts respect pecs.”

 

They continued. The dread crawled higher now — like something brushing just beneath the skin. Jane’s breath caught. Her eyes scanned corners and rooftops. There was a pressure, like they were in a submarine taking on water.

 

Then—she appeared.

 

At the far end of the alley, like she had always been there.

 

Kuchisake-onna.

 

Tall. Silent. Hair black as pitch and long like grief. A red coat buttoned tight, her face obscured by a medical mask stained faintly dark. Her hands hung at her sides, as if deciding which one would kill first.

 

She stepped forward.

 

The sound was wet. Like dragging something heavy.

 

Jane tensed but remembered the promise. She gritted her teeth.

 

Kuchisake-onna’s voice cut the air:

 

“Am I… beautiful?”

 

Time froze. Jane’s grip tightened slightly — not on a weapon, but on the decision to let it be.

 

Medina was supposed to run. That was the plan. He was supposed to sprint and draw her into the team’s kill zone.

 

But he didn’t move.

 

He just looked at her. Deadpan. Then grinned.

 

Medina: “Honestly? You’re kind of killing it, lady. Creepy-hot, mysterious, low-maintenance vibe? Ten outta ten. You’re the whole horror baddie package.”

 

Jane’s mouth fell open slightly. “…what?”

 

Kuchisake-onna’s head tilted slowly — a cracked, bird-like motion. She raised her hand toward her mask, fingers trembling.

 

But she froze. Her fingers stopped just short. Her arm twitched. Something in her glitched, like a corrupted image. Her head twitched the other way. Her hand dropped.

 

She just… stared at Medina.

 

A squint. A moment of genuine confusion. Not anger. Not hunger.

 

Perplexed.

 

Like a woman wondering if a guy at the bar really just called her cursed scars “aesthetic.”

 

She blinked.

 

Then turned.

 

And walked away.

 

No fade. No vanish. Just…walked. Like she didn’t want to deal with whatever that was.

 

As she passed through the mist further down, she glanced back once.

 

Straight at Medina.

 

Her stare wasn’t hateful.

 

It was confused.

 

Almost offended.

 

Jane, still stunned, finally spoke: “You cracked her programming…”

 

Medina shrugged, sliding his shirt back on. “Sometimes, you gotta out-weird the paranormal.”

 

Lou (over comms): “…what the hell just happened?”

 

Jane: “She didn’t attack.”

 

Medina (smirking): “Guess she wasn’t ready for this much man.”

 

The alley stayed quiet as the squad began to regroup, but something had shifted — not just in the mission, but in the curse. In her.

 

A hairline fracture In something ancient.

 

Something might’ve started to break

 

Scene: Tokyo – Late Night Alleyway, Set for the Bait Mission

 

Scene: Quiet Street Outside a Vending Machine – Late Evening

 

Medina stood alone, sipping canned coffee under a flickering lamplight. The vending machine buzzed softly behind him. The air was calm, no supernatural chill, no dread creeping into his spine. Just the faint smell of asphalt and sakura leaves carried by a spring breeze.

 

Then… she was just there.

 

No whisper. No footsteps. No dread chord in the air.

 

The Slit-Mouthed Woman stood a few feet away, mask on, her hair cascading over her pale shoulders like silk soaked in shadow.

 

Medina blinked.

 

No flinch. No hand to his weapon. He just stared at her like someone who’d bumped into an old coworker at a grocery store.

 

She tilted her head. Eyes narrowed, not in anger — but in genuine confusion.

 

Slit-Mouthed Woman: “Why… did you say that?”

 

A pause.

 

Medina scratched his head.

 

Medina: “Thought I was gonna die. So, I figured… screw it. If I go out, I’m going out weird.”

 

She blinked. Processing that.

 

Then slowly raised a pale hand and touched her mask.

 

She hesitated… then lowered it just enough to reveal her disfigured mouth again — torn lips, carved cheeks. But something was off. The twisted smile wasn’t as raw… the flesh not as gray. It looked faintly… pink. Like blood had returned to her skin for the first time in centuries.

 

Her eyes met his again.

 

Slit-Mouthed Woman: “What does… ten out of ten… mean?”

 

Medina was quiet for a second.

 

Then he smirked.

 

Medina: “It means… you were the prettiest thing I’d ever seen.”

 

A long, long silence. Her expression didn’t shift much, but something behind those haunted eyes flickered — like a wall being questioned.

 

Then, she turned.

 

She didn’t vanish in smoke or screams.

 

She just walked away, long hair swaying, bare feet silent on the street.

 

Before disappearing around the corner, she glanced back.

 

No malice.

 

Just confusion… and a sliver of something human.

 

 

 

Scene: Safehouse, Later That Night

 

The squad sat around the kitchen table. A ramen pot bubbled on the stovetop. Medina sipped from a beer can, unusually quiet.

 

Martinez: “Alright, Candy Man. What now?”

 

Medina (still distant): “She showed up again. No threat. No aura. Just… there.”

 

Nolasco: “And?”

 

Medina: “She asked why I said what I said. I told her. Then she asked what ‘ten out of ten’ meant.”

 

Vega (raising an eyebrow): “What the hell?”

 

Gonzales: “You teachin’ English to yokai now?”

 

Jane leaned in, eyes sharp but intrigued.

 

Jane: “Wait. She wanted to understand something?”

 

Medina nodded.

 

Medina: “She looked more… human. Less corpse, more… I dunno. Sad girl on the street.”

 

A heavy silence filled the room.

 

Then Lou spoke up, voice low.

 

Lou: “That wasn’t just psychological warfare. You disrupted the curse logic. Her whole existence is based on a strict, horrific loop — ask the question, punish the answer. You gave her… something new.”

 

Medina: “A compliment?”

 

Lou (nodding): “Maybe. Or maybe… empathy. You jammed a humanity-shaped wrench in the gears.”

 

Jane (softly): “So… her curse feeds off fear and ritual. But you gave her choice.”

 

Gonzales: “Like a haunted record skipping ‘cause you played jazz over it.”

 

Lou stood, pacing slightly now, deep in thought.

 

Lou: “This changes things. We’ve been going in treating them like monsters. Hit lists. Traps. Kill zones. But what if some of these spirits… can be reasoned with? Not all. But some.”

 

Vega: “You wanna give therapy to demons now?”

 

Lou: “No. But I wanna understand what binds them. Break the curse, not just the creature.”

 

The squad sat with that for a beat.

 

Medina looked at his now-cold coffee. Then grinned.

 

Medina: “So what you’re saying is… I ghost busted a yokai with flirtation.”

 

Martinez (flat): “Don’t push it.”

 

Nolasco: “You’re never gonna live this down.”

 

Jane, staring at her drink, half-laughing, half-stunned: “You told a centuries-old spirit she was a ten… and she’s rethinking her life.”

 

Lou (quietly, almost to himself): “We adapt. We rethink. Not just how we kill… but how we save.”

 

 

Scene: Safehouse – Yokota Base – Tactical Briefing Room

 

The 13th Psalm squad sits around a small table littered with case files, printed maps, and energy drinks. A laptop connected to a projector flick through slides as Lou presents the newest mission dossier.

 

Lou (voice cold, focused):

“Target: Saeki residence, Nerima ward. Classified as an ultra-high threat spiritual entity. Based on what we know, we’re dealing with a grudge — a curse born of murder, pain, and hatred so powerful it spreads like an infection.”

 

The projector clicks.

A photo of the unassuming house appears: two stories, gray walls, overgrown weeds, all silent. It looks innocent. But everyone feels the weight in the room.

 

Jane (arms crossed):

“Looks like the set from The Grudge. I’m guessing that’s not a coincidence?”

 

Lou:

“It’s not. The movie franchise? Based on this house. Loosely. Some creative liberties have been taken but the foundation is real. The production crew visited the location in the early 2000s. Only a few people walked inside. Most of them died within six months. No one returned.”

 

Medina (sipping coffee):

“So we’re fighting a reboot?”

 

Martinez (flat):

“We’re walking into a meat grinder that inspired a horror franchise. Respect the source.”

 

Gonzales:

“What’s the curse spread like?”

 

Lou clicks to the next slide. A diagram of known victims — red string webbing from one person to the next.

 

Lou:

“It’s viral. The moment you enter the house, you’re marked. Doesn’t matter what you believe. Doesn’t matter who you are. You’ve been seen. And once you're marked…”

 

Vega (grim):

“…she comes for you.”

 

Gonzales:

“It’s not just her, right? The kid. Toshio. And the cat.”

 

Lou:

“Correct. Toshio was their son. Kayako’s son. Witnessed everything. His spirit is part of the curse. So is their cat, Mar. Everything that died that night is bound together. That’s what makes it so dangerous.”

 

Nolasco (arms crossed):

“Run us through it. What the hell actually happened in that house?”

 

Lou switches to an old police file. Photos show a woman’s corpse, her neck snapped. Scribbled notes reference obsession, domestic homicide, and ritual suicide.

 

 

 

Lou:

“Kayako Saeki. Mid-30s. Obsessive journal entries about a professor named Kobayashi. Her husband, Takeo, found them. Convinced she was having an affair, he murdered her by snapping her neck and shoving her body into the attic. Then drowned their son, Toshio, in the bathtub… and killed the cat for good measure.”

 

Vega:

“Dude went full psycho.”

 

Lou:

“He hanged himself afterward. But that moment — all the rage, all the trauma — created something. A stain on the world. That house became a breeding ground for spiritual decay. Anyone who enters… dies. Then the curse moves through them, like a virus.”

 

Martinez (staring at the house photo):

“Can’t punch that.”

 

Medina:

“And even if we burn the house down?”

 

Lou:

“It’s been burned before. Still stands. No scorch marks. Like time doesn’t apply.”

 

Nolasco:

“Then how the hell do we kill it?”

 

Lou (after a long pause):

“We don’t know yet. That’s the problem. Even the Vatican issued a red-tier containment rating. Everyone who’s ever tried to confront it head-on has failed.”

 

Gonzales (quietly):

“Marked means one of us might not make it back.”

 

A heavy silence.

 

Jane breaks it.

 

Jane:

“Maybe this isn’t about killing it. Maybe… it’s about breaking the moment that caused it.”

 

Vega:

“You mean… time travel?”

 

Martinez:

“Like therapy again? Worked for freakin’ caramel-boy over there.”

 

Medina:

“Hey. That’s Dr. Caramel now.”

 

A few chuckles. Tension breaks briefly — but the weight returns.

 

Lou (looking at the house photo):

“We don’t walk into this one half-cocked. We gather every lead, every file. We’re going to need a plan that doesn’t rely on brute force or bullets.”

 

Martinez:

“I’ll contact people. They might know priest on the area

 

Lou:

“Good. And no one enters that house. Not until we have something solid. We’re not losing anyone to this one. Not like this.”

 

The screen fades to black.

 

 

Psalm 13: The Kayako Investigation

 

Entry: The Quiet Before the Curse

 

 

 

\[Found in the 13th Psalm Black Files — Case 392: “Saeki House”\]

Compiled from audio logs, journal fragments, and an incident report.

 

 

 

\[Jane’s Journal – Handwritten Entry\]

“They warned me not to go. Told me the priest would refuse to speak. But he didn’t. He just asked if I’d dreamed of a woman with her head twisted like a corkscrew. When I said yes, he let me in.”

 

 

 

Jane’s path took her deep into the folds of Osaka’s older districts, where the streets still hold the memory of old blood and older ghosts. The priest she met didn’t live in a church, but a weather-beaten ryokan converted into a private shrine. His face was lined with age and fear. Not wisdom — fear.

 

“The woman you seek,” he said, “wasn’t killed. She was unmade. The moment she realized her husband no longer saw her as human, she unraveled. Spirit, flesh, soul — all became one curse. You cannot exorcise her. You can only understand her… and pray she understands you.”

 

 

 

He gave Jane a small Ofuda, a talisman soaked in sake and sealed in wax. She didn’t know what to do with it, so she kept it close — pocketed it like a confession.

 

 

 

\[Martinez – Bodycam Transcript\]

Location: Bar in Nerima District. Time: 2200.

 

Martinez leaned on the bar, sipping a warm beer, speaking to a local in half-spoken Japanese and all-charisma.

 

“The house? People don’t even look at it. Mailmen drop letters five houses down and say a prayer. Cops won’t respond to domestic calls there. The dogs won’t bark. You know what that means? Even animals know better.”

 

 

 

The man next to him said he lost a cousin who went urban exploring in 2009. He found him a week later, slumped in his bathroom with his face twisted into a silent scream. Martinez lit a cigarette, thanked him, and left.

 

 

 

\[Medina’s Research Notes – Tokyo National Library\]

 

“Noticed recurring glyphs in the pages of Takeo Saeki’s old art books. Scribbled between margins. Always the same shape. Like a spiral. Looks like something ancient. Might be linked to Yamato-era burial rituals — the way the soul is sealed by emotion.”

 

 

 

Medina left the library at midnight. When he closed the book, the spine let out a sound like a sigh.

 

 

 

\[Gonzales and Vega – Audio Recording, Unofficial Interrogation\]

Location: Nerima Hospital, psychiatric ward.

 

They visited Rei Hoshino, a former childhood friend of Toshio. She hadn’t spoken in ten years. But when they mentioned the name “Kayako,” she blinked — then started humming.

 

It was a lullaby.

 

Gonzales leaned in:

 

“Did something happen in that house, when you were a kid?”

 

 

 

She whispered:

 

“She never blinks.”

 

 

 

 

 

\[Lou – Unlogged, Unrecorded Entry – Location: Saeki Residence, 0400 Hours\]

 

Lou stood in front of the house.

 

No squad. No lights. Just wind scraping dead leaves across concrete. He’d been there for four hours. Watching. Thinking. Trying to imagine what the curse wanted.

 

He had one thought. One instinct.

 

“Fuck it.”

 

He walked forward. The door opened on its own.

 

 

Entry: THE MARKING

 

 

 

The house breathed.

 

That’s the only way Lou could describe it.

 

Every step on the dusty floorboards gave off a sound that didn’t match his weight. It echoed too long. He passed by a shoe rack with small child-sized slippers, perfectly aligned. A moldy portrait of a woman with her eyes scratched out. A hallway that seemed longer than it should be.

 

And then…

The creaking started.

 

The sound of something pulling itself along the ceiling, slow and deliberate. Lou drew his weapon, but it felt like trying to bring a gun to a drowning.

 

SKKKRRRRRAAAAAAAAAK.

 

 

 

The sound of fingernails on wood — but it came from above.

 

Lou raised his eyes.

 

Kayako was crawling upside-down along the ceiling beam.

 

Neck broken. Eyes wide. Mouth agape in an endless croak that didn’t end with sound, but with intent. A jagged, stuttering breath rattled her frame. Her body moved in jerks — not puppet-like, but as if physics forgot how to apply to her.

 

She stared at him, then disappeared.

 

No noise. Just gone.

 

That was when he felt it.

 

A pressure in his chest. Like his heartbeat suddenly didn’t belong to him. Like something else was watching from inside.

 

His breathing slowed. The hallway elongated. Doors stretched tall like monoliths. Whispers without a source drifted behind the walls.

 

A child’s voice.

 

Lou turned to see Toshio, pale and unmoving, crouched at the end of the hallway.

 

 

Lou, trying to keep control of his thoughts, muttered,

 

“Toshio.”

 

 

 

Toshio stared. Then vanished.

 

The house snapped back to normal.

 

Lou collapsed to his knees. Sweat dripping. But his mind — still intact.

 

Barely.

 

 

 

Outside, hours later:

 

The squad rushed in when Lou exited the house, drenched in sweat, eyes bloodshot but defiant.

 

Jane:

 

“What the hell did you do?!”

 

 

 

Lou (calmly):

 

“I invited the curse in.”

 

 

 

Medina:

 

“You’re marked, man. That’s suicide.”

 

 

 

Lou:

 

“No. It’s intel.”

 

 

 

He turned to Jane, breathing hard.

 

Nobody in her situation asked to be cursed like this. I need to determined the origin of this thing.

 

Martinez:

 

“Or this “thing” eats your soul while we watch.”

 

 

 

Lou:

 

“Then we’ll find another way to gather intel.”

 

 

 

 

 

Psalm 13: The Hauntings of Lou Phillips

 

Entry: The Spiral Deepens

 

 

 

\[Case File 392-A Addendum – Internal Memo, Medina to Martinez\]

“He’s not sleeping anymore. Keeps the lights off. Won’t talk. Whatever’s happening to him… it’s not just mental. The air around Lou feels wrong now. Cold, like it’s hiding something.”

 

 

 

NIGHT ONE

 

They found him sitting up at 2:43 AM, staring at the front door.

 

Gonzales said he’d heard Lou talking to someone. Thought he was on comms.

Only… there was no comms.

 

They asked him who he was talking to.

 

Lou just said,

 

“She’s trying to show me something. I don’t think I want to know what it is.”

 

 

That night, the bathtub filled on its own. Martinez went to turn it off, thinking someone was wasting water. When he reached the edge, he saw hair in the drain. Black, long, knotted. Still dripping, even though the faucet was dry.

 

Something exhaled behind him.

 

He didn’t turn around. He just walked out.

 

NIGHT TWO

 

Lou walked into the hallway of the safehouse at 3:12 AM. Jane followed — said she was worried. He stood there for twenty minutes, not blinking, not moving. Then he turned and whispered:

 

“He was on the ceiling.”

 

She asked who.

 

He didn’t answer.

 

Later, the squad found claw marks on the hallway ceiling — fresh, wet. Wood splinters scattered like fingernail shavings.

 

 

 

NIGHT THREE

 

Vega was monitoring infrared. Saw a thermal signature near Lou’s room.

 

“Looked like a kid. 4 feet tall. Crouched. Watching him sleep.”

 

 

 

When they opened the door, there was no one there. But Lou was wide awake.

 

“He’s not sleeping,” Jane whispered.

 

 

 

NIGHT FOUR

 

They heard Lou screaming.

 

Not yelling. Not shouting.

 

Screaming.

 

They broke into the room and found it empty — save for the mirror. The entire mirror had a handprint on it. But not just any handprint.

 

It had five fingers… and a thumbprint on the opposite side, like someone’s hand had wrapped around Lou’s head.

 

That was the first time Jane cried.

 

 

 

THE FINAL HAUNTING

 

 

 

Lou hadn’t spoken in two days. Not even to Jane.

 

He sat alone, in a pitch-black room, staring into a tall mirror. No weapons. No armor. Just his dog tags and the cross he always wore around his neck.

 

Drip… drip…

 

The sound of water. There were no pipes in the room.

 

He looked up.

 

Kayako was behind him.

 

Neck crooked, body twitching like broken marionette strings. Her hair slithered across the floor like it had a life of its own. That rattle — the death rattle — grew louder.

 

But Lou didn’t move. He stared into the mirror.

 

And the reflection changed.

 

It was Jeff.

Smiling.

Lips cracked. Eyes sunken. That terrible, mocking expression — pure sadism frozen in time.

 

Lou’s jaw clenched.

 

He didn’t blink.

 

Lou knew she was there but he didn’t look at her

 

Kayako looked into the mirror too… and froze.

 

She saw it.

 

She saw Jeff.

 

Her head tilted like a curious dog. Confusion ,Fear?

 

She reached out slowly. Put her hand on Lou’s head — almost gently.

 

Then her grip tightened. Violent.

She slammed his head into the mirrorly

 

Glass shattered — but Lou didn’t black out.

 

Instead… he saw.

 

 

 

THE VISIONS

 

 

 

The crawlspace of the Saeki house.

Kayako curled in a corner, writing in her journal. The words melt, smear, drip like wet ink.

Footsteps.

Takeo’s voice:

 

“You’re not even a woman anymore.”

 

 

 

The scream as he snaps her neck — it echoes forever.

 

She’s dragged. Broken. Left to rot with her son watching. He dies next. Soaked in red. The rage loops into eternity. The curse is born.

 

 

 

Then it shifts.

 

Afghanistan.

A concrete compound.

Women with black eyes and bruised arms whisper behind mesh veils. One looks at Lou. Her lips move.

 

“Why didn’t you help?”

 

 

 

Lou remembers.

 

He wasn’t allowed to intervene.

Command said it would “complicate relations.”

 

Then the woman’s face starts bubbling. Melting.

 

Her mouth opens like Kayako’s — a gaping black void.

 

Another woman. Another wife. Beaten. Crying.

 

Her face transforms too.

 

And another.

 

And another.

 

Each time:

Kayako.

 

 

 

Lou drops to his knees. Eyes bloodshot. His breath shaking.

 

In his mind:

 

“You saw it too. That’s why she chose you.”

 

 

 

 

 

AFTERMATH

 

They found him catatonic for four hours.

 

When he finally stood, his knuckles were bleeding. The mirror was in pieces.

 

Jane held him. She tried to speak — but he just shook his head.

 

Then he looked at the squad.

 

“She’s not just a curse. She’s grief, rage, betrayal. She’s a wound that never closes.”

 

 

 

Medina:

 

“You saw the source?”

 

 

 

Lou:

 

“I lived it.”

 

 

 

Jane:

THE BRIEFING

 

They were all sitting around Lou in the motel room. He hadn’t slept. He hadn’t eaten. Still, when he spoke, his voice had the kind of weight that couldn’t be ignored — like a sermon at a funeral.

 

Lou (quiet):

 

“I’m going back.”

 

 

 

The room went dead silent.

 

Gonzales:

 

“Back? Back where? Hell no, man.”

 

 

 

Vega:

 

“That house is a graveyard. And not a normal one.”

 

 

 

Nolasco:

 

“She tried to kill you, bro. I saw what was on your face. You’re tellin’ us you want more of that?”

 

 

 

Lou nodded once.

 

Lou:

 

“I saw something. She’s stuck in a loop. A wound. We’ve seen what happens when a ghost is angry. But what happens when it’s afraid?”

 

 

 

Medina:

 

“So what? You’re gonna walk into that house and ask her to cry it out with you?”

 

 

 

Lou (firm):

 

“I’m going to confront what she can’t.”

 

 

 

The room shifted. Martinez finally broke the silence.

 

Martinez:

 

“…We’ll be outside. Running overwatch. If you’re wrong, we pull you out. No argument.”

 

 

 

Lou (nods):

 

“Understood.”

 

 

 

 

 

LATER THAT NIGHT

 

LOCATION: Temporary Op Van, 2 blocks from the Saeki Residence

TIME: 0216 hours

 

Medina sat in the van. Alone. Watching the feed flicker. Then…

 

Footsteps behind him.

 

He turned.

 

There she was. The Slit-Mouthed Woman.

 

But… something had changed. Her mouth still hung open in that terrible Glasgow smile — but her eyes weren’t the same. They were human. Sad. Fearful.

 

She sat beside him, not moving, barely existing, like mist that had chosen to stay.

 

Medina (whispers):

 

“What do you want?”

 

 

 

She didn’t answer.

 

Her head turned slowly to the drone feed. Lou. Alone. Walking toward the house.

 

Medina:

 

“You’re afraid of him, too.”

 

 

 

No denial. Just silence.

 

Medina (soft):

 

“He’s been through more hell than most people could survive. Lost his parents. Brother tried to kill him. Watched women get beaten overseas and couldn’t stop it. Buried too many friends. He never got soft. Never turned bitter. Just kept fighting.”

 

 

 

The Slit-Mouthed Woman tilted her head.

 

Medina:

 

“I think… I think he took on this curse on purpose. Not to kill it. To carry it.”

 

 

 

She flickered — a twitch of emotion — like she wanted to say something but couldn’t.

 

And then she was gone.",1,1750562196.0,13Psalm,0,1.0,False

1lhe177,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alibaba/comments/1lhe177/freight_forwarder_classic_scam_alert/,Freight Forwarder classic scam alert,"Hi everyone,

I recently purchased a large quantity of custom-printed coffee cups under my own brand. The supplier has been fantastic — responsive, professional, and easy to work with. However, they do not offer DDP shipping, so I had to arrange my own freight forwarding.

Once production was complete, the goods were handed over to **Shenzhen Yiluyouni International Freight Forwarding Co., Ltd.** Initially, they quoted me $1.05/kg for sea freight, which is a little more expensive than some offers on Freightos. My Chinese friend has confirmed they are legal company, with 11 years of experience in exporting; plus their Alibaba store has been operating for 2 years, which is kinda rare for a forwarder, and 37 good reviews. In general, they look legit, I have searched and could not find any bad reviews about them on any forums. My billed weight is 2,500 kg, though the actual volumetric weight provided by my supplier is closer to 1800-2,000 kg. I understand some variation due to deformation during packaging is expected, but a 20–25% increase in volume seems excessive.

After receiving the goods, the forwarder suddenly revised the cost to $4,500 USD, which is nearly double the initial quote. They said new price is 1.57/kg plus insurance plus commission fee, plus etc.  They are also insisting on payment via bank transfer or cash, refusing to create an order on Alibaba — which leaves me with no buyer protection. 

Notably, before they received my shipment, their communication was incredibly fast, almost too eager. Now that they have the goods in hand, they respond once a day at most and act as if they’re busy like a president.

At this point, I’m considering abandoning the shipment entirely. The total value of the goods is around $3,500 USD, and I have another supplier willing to reproduce the full order and ship under DDP for $5,000 USD. I’d rather spend more with someone reliable than let this current forwarder continue wasting my time. Plus, they can't profit from my branded cups — these aren't blank white coffee cups; they’re customized with my logo, so resale isn’t feasible as no one would want to buy them in bulk at a high price than myself.

I’ve bought and shipped multiple times through Alibaba and even Taobao without any issues — until now. This is the first time I’ve run into something like this, and it’s been a frustrating and eye-opening experience. I’ve learned my lesson the hard way. I take full responsibility for trusting them, and I’ve paid the price. I’m only sharing this now to warn others so they don’t fall into the same company.

If you’re ever considering working with Shenzhen Yiluyouni International Freight Forwarding Co., Ltd., my advice is simple: Stay far away.

Thanks for reading — and I hope this helps someone avoid what I’ve gone through.

1lhe0n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1lhe0n0/grandma_gets_intense_about_breakfast/,Grandma gets intense about breakfast.,"So this happened a good while ago when I was still in High School. Every so often my grandmother would come to visit from another state and just take up residence with me and my mom for however long she decided to stay. No warning, just show up with some bags and let us know she was here to help. My mom worked for a hospital chain and was pretty well traveled and often I was left to fend for myself for a day or two which was not a big deal I was 16 at the time and my dad lived maybe 20 minutes away, but if grandma found out mom was going to be gone she would immediately appear to “watch the house and chaperone.” So it’s one of those times my mom is gone and it’s just me and grandma and I was a little extra put out by the intrusion in my house. Earlier that month one of my family members had found out I had come out and they proceeded to share this news with several other relatives who had no business knowing my business. My grandma was very very religious and I didn’t know for sure if she has heard anything. So one morning I am in the kitchen trying to figure out what I want for breakfast and grandma walks in and asks what I’m doing. I said “Trying to decide if I want cereal or just coffee.” Grandma suddenly gives me a very serious look and says “Some people find a cereal that is right for them and they have it every day faithfully for the rest of their lives. Some people struggle to find a cereal that is to their taste and they start to think they don’t like cereal at all. When really they just need to go out and try different kinds of cereals until they find the one cereal they are happy with for the rest of their lives. It’s just really important to not just give up on cereal all together.” And then she just walked away and never mentioned it again. ",2,1750561886.0,story,0,1.0,False
1lhdzkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Machupicchu/comments/1lhdzkb/9_days_in_peru_report/,9 Days In Peru Report,"This community was such a helpful resource to me while planning my solo trip, so hoping that my experience can provide insight for somebody else as well.

Some details about me:

* I'm a young female. For the most part I felt safe traveling the country myself (and met quite a few fellow solo female travelers along the way!)
* I was in Peru for 9 days/8 nights in early-mid June. The weather mostly aligned with Peru's dry season, but I did get one day of snow (see below!)
* I consider myself a budget traveler, trying as much as possible to save money where I can. However I did spend a good amount on booking a 2-day Inca Trail hike with a tour group. This was mainly because Machu Picchu tickets were sold out for my trip window and so I wouldn't have to handle all the logistics of getting there. The tour was successful in that regard.
* I thankfully didn't suffer much from altitude sickness. Don't know whether it was my approach (starting in Ollantaytambo rather than Cusco and taking it *very* slow in the beginning) or just the way my body works, but I was able to get through all my planned itineraries without being derailed. I brought Diamox with me and tested it in Lima, but didn't like the side effects (intense numbing over legs, arms, face). So I decided not to use it and basically rawdogged the entire trip
* I flew with LATAM and Sky Airlines and didn't have issues at any point with my carry-on luggage (I was pretty concerned about the size)

Day 1: Lima

* Had a redeye flight into Lima and a 6am flight to Cusco the next day so unfortunately couldn't spend much time here
* Took the Airport Express bus (\~$5 USD) to Miraflores, where I stayed. The stand is easy to find once you exit through the baggage claim and head outside toward the parking lots
* Visited:
   * Kennedy Park
   * La Lucha Sangucheria Criolla
   * Picarones Mary (beware the bees!)
   * Parque del Amor

Day 2: Cusco -> Ollantaytambo

* Booked Taxidatum ($7) for my early morning drive to the airport
* Once in Cusco, I made use of my Inca Trail tour company's airport pickup service (included in tour price) to get me to Calle Pavitos. From there, I boarded a colectivo to Ollantaytambo (15 soles) to start my acclimatization at a lower altitude
* I took it VERY slow and purposefully didn't schedule much this day so as to help my body adjust
* Visited:
   * Plaza de Armas
   * Casa de Cuyes
      * One of the highlights of my trip! Highly recommend if you're a guinea pig lover. Be sure to bring a tip

Day 3: Explore the Sacred Valley

* I asked my hotel front desk for a driver to take me to Moray, Maras, then back to Ollantaytambo. Negotiated the price down to 120 soles. It was a private taxi, and the driver waited for me for however long I wanted at each stop (although I tried to keep it around 30 min per stop which is standard). He took a scenic ""shortcut"" route up the mountains, which was absolutely breathtaking!!
* Visited:
   * Moray (70 soles in cash for Boleto Turístico Parcial Circuito III, valid for two consecutive days)
   * Salineras de Maras (20 soles cash for foreigners)
   * Had a good local lunch at Restaurante ""Doña Eva"" for 10 soles
   * Ollantaytambo Ruins (included in Boleto Turístico)

Day 4: Ollantaytambo -> Pisac -> Cusco

* Took a colectivo from Ollantaytambo -> Urubamba (a few soles)
* At Urubamba, transferred to a colectivo to Pisac (a few soles)
   * The first colectivo dropoff was a \~20 minute walk from the pickup to Pisac, and it wasn't super pleasant esp with my luggage. If I were to do this route again I'd ask the first driver if he'd drive me directly to the second pickup spot for 1-2 more soles
* Visited:
   * Ulrike's Tortas Y Mas Pisac: such a lovely family-run cafe with great carrot cake. They also allowed me to store my luggage there for the day while I toured the town
   * Mercado de artesanías and Nuevo Mercado Artesanal
   * Pisac Archeological Park (included in Boleto Turístico)
      * I took a taxi for 30 soles up to the top of the ruins and hiked for 2 hours back down to the town. This was easily the most stunning hike I went on but also super challenging. It's straight downhill so hard on the knees, and included many winding paths carved right into the mountainside, without handrails, and steep cliff dropoffs to the side. Wouldn't recommend if you're afraid of heights
* Took another colectivo from Pisac to Cusco (5 soles)

Day 5: Full day in Cusco

* Visited:
   * Mercado de San Blas
   * Three Monkeys Coffee
   * Plaza de Armas
      * Parades and festivities!
   * Had dinner at a local menú joint for 6 soles, Samaritano
* I had booked a free walking tour with Inkan Milky Way Cusco but ended up being the only person who showed up, so it was canceled

Day 6: Inca Trail Day 1

* I went with Sam Travel Peru
* Visited:
   * Wiñay Wayna: these ruins were absolutely stunning!! Would highly recommend seeing, but I believe you only can through doing the Inca Trail
   * Sun Gate
   * Machu Picchu route 1a with classic postcard view

Day 7: Inca Trail Day 2

* This was basically just a guided tour of Machu Picchu Circuit 3, \~3 hours
* Group return to Cusco

Day 8: Rainbow Mountain

* I booked an early morning tour through GetYourGuide with tour operator Chullos Travel.  I didn't hear from them until I reached out myself over Whatsapp the day before. They also flubbed my pickup location (said they would pick me up at my hotel but changed it to a plaza like 30 minutes before the time). The tour included transport up to the mountain and back, breakfast, lunch, but not the 30 soles cash entry fee.
* It snowed! The weather up there is expectedly unpredictable, so if you get precipitation you may not be able to see the colors clearly. But it was a worthwhile journey nonetheless.

Day 9: Cusco -> Lima -> Home

Tips:

* Most places prefer payment by cash. They might have the option to pay by card but will add a 5% extra fee
* You can take out soles without fees by using Banco de la Nación ATMs. There were a ton in Lima and Cusco, but not in the smaller cities, so plan accordingly. You can withdraw max 400 soles in one transaction
* For Rainbow Mountain, if you're not fit to climb, I'd recommend bringing 80-100 soles in cash for a horse each way. There are plenty of opportunities to catch one along the hike
* Colectivos are a very doable, cheap way to get around, esp in the Sacred Valley. Make sure to bring coins and also consult Google Maps to find each pickup spot

TL;DR: Dated my high school sweetheart for years, broke up before college so I wouldn’t do long distance. While I was gone, my toxic best friend “comforted” him and they started dating. Years later, I moved back, we reconnected, realized we still loved each other, and he left her for me. I know I helped him cheat — but I don’t regret it one bit. I got my soulmate back and lost a fake friend.

I (24F) dated Tom (fake name, 24M) all through high school, from freshman year until the summer before college. We weren’t “never fight” perfect, but we were *good* perfect — supportive, honest, and genuinely in love.

My “best friend” Kayla (fake name, 23F) and I had been friends since 3rd grade. Looking back, she was incredibly toxic — manipulative, controlling — but I was scared of losing my friend group if I cut her off.

When it was time for college, I moved out of state and broke up with Tom. I told him I loved him and always would, but I knew long-distance would break me. We cried for hours. He respected it, but it wrecked us both.

While I was gone (getting my Bachelor’s in Biology and Criminal Justice), Tom stayed home and got his MBA. He fell into a depression after I left — and of all people, Kayla swooped in to “help.” They ended up dating.

Fast forward: I move back home 4 years later, get a job as a forensic analyst ($74k/year), and Tom’s business absolutely takes off — from 2 employees to nearly 100 in 4 years.

A year after moving back home, I run into him while grocery shopping. We were both so happy to see each other that we agreed to get coffee. Three days later, at that coffee date, he drops, *“Oh, by the way, I’m dating Kayla.”*

I was stunned. He used to hate Kayla — he always told me she used me and treated me like crap. I asked how it happened. He said, *“I was struggling after we broke up, she was there, we bonded… and we’ve been together about 5 years.”*

I asked if they were serious — he shrugged: *“Yeah, I guess you could say that. We don’t live together or anything.”*

I asked if he saw a future with her — another shrug: *“Sure.”*  
Finally, I asked if he loved her. He hesitated (like he always did when not lying, but not being fully honest) and said, *“Sure.”*

The non-enthusiastic *""sure""* hit me so hard I wanted to beg him to come back.

We kept meeting up for coffee and catching up for about 2 weeks. One day he asked, *“Do you still love me? Not just as a friend, but like how you loved me when we were teenagers?”* I didn’t answer at first, then I nodded. He nodded too and said, *“I still love you too. Honestly, I don’t even know if what I have with Kayla is love. She’s toxic and I’m pretty sure she’s using me.”*

I asked why he hadn’t left her. He said, *“I feel like I owe her. She was there when I was at my lowest, so I feel like I have to stay.”* That broke me all over again.

The next day, he texted saying he told Kayla we’d been getting coffee. She flipped — called him every name, called me a \[girl who gets around\], accused me of using him, spewed a ton of nasty stuff. He asked if he could come over. Of course I said yes.

We put on a movie, played games, and we ended up kissing. It felt like being teenagers again.

He told Kayla and broke up with her. She tried to “expose” me as a gold digger (which is ridiculous, since I don’t care about his money at all). She failed spectacularly.

Now, Tom and I have been back together for about a year, and we’ve been talking seriously about getting engaged.

Do I feel bad for helping him cheat? Honestly… no. Not at all. I got my soulmate back, and I lost the toxic “friend” I should have cut off years ago.",1,1750561759.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

**Base Tea Leaves**

The foundation of any great cake tea lies in the quality of its tea leaves.High-quality cake teas often feature a robust black tea base, such as Assam or Ceylon, known for their bold flavors that complement the sweetness of the cake-inspired ingredients.

Rooibos, a naturally caffeine-free option, offers a smooth, earthy base ideal for those seeking a relaxing evening beverage.

**Natural Flavorings and Ingredients**

To authentically replicate the taste of cake, premium cake teas rely on natural flavorings. This could include cocoa nibs for a chocolate cake flavor, vanilla bean pieces for a vanilla cake essence, or freeze-dried berries to mimic the taste of fruit-filled cakes. The absence of artificial flavors differentiates high-quality cake teas from cheaper alternatives, providing a richer and more satisfying taste experience.

**Aromatic Blends**

Good cake teas also feature an aromatic profile of sweet and spicy scents such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger for a truly inviting and decadent blend. These notes help cut through the sweetness of the cake-inspired flavours and add depth to the tea.**caffeine content**

Many cake teas contain caffeine naturally present in the tea leaves (typically black and green tea).This can range from moderate to high depending on the specific base tea used.However, caffeine-free options using rooibos or herbal blends are also available, catering to different preferences and dietary needs.

1lhdvch,https://www.tiktok.com/@cositasjenah?_t=ZP-8xPGXCiR2tS&_r=1,Low views,"Hi!! So I’m recently experiencing really low views on my TikTok and I don’t understand why I use to get between 500-1000 view each post but since  last week I’ve only been getting 0-50 view maybe a 100 with only about 10 likes which is unusual for me. I’ve watch other TikTok’s with people having the same problem and tried to use creators search insights to help ,but the views are still pretty low. I’ve check my account status and it says I have a live violation for hate speech that happened a year ago and I couldn’t get it appealed (I’ve tried ). But since this problem is recent I don’t think it should affect my page right now since after the strike I was still getting a good amount of views and haven’t had any problems with any of my videos and iam still allowed to go live but I just don’t do lives because I’m not comfortable yet . My question is how can I get out of this super low views problem? And Is my content just not as entertaining to my community anymore ? If you can take a look at my TikTok page with the link i provided and give me some fed back about my content it would help me out a lot because at this point im wondering if my content is just not that interesting. I make outfit videos ,thrift hauls ,make up,and the occasional barista content ( just me making personal coffees and tea) ",2,1750561392.0,Tiktokhelp,2,1.0,False

The questions I have are nothing serious so you don't have to bother yourself by responding, but if you want to, please do, any answers will help.

Now, I am mainly asking this because I don't want my expectations to get high, but in terms of space, how much do I exactly have? Like, I was discussing with my roommate, and we were talking about getting consoles for the dorm and everything, but now that I have properly looked at the room size after touring Carleton, I feel like I have really gotten my hopes up. I have been to some friends dorms and they were definitely bigger than Carleton, and we played VR, PS5, and Xbox, which was really fun so I really wanted to do that as well with my friends.

Questions:

1. Do I have space on the desk to have two monitor setup with my pc being under the desk?
2. Can I bring maybe a small TV in for the console? And is there a place to mount the TV where they won't get mad about?
3. Is it possible to do an Ethernet connection to my PC? (On their website they recommend to bring an ethernet cable, so that's why I am asking this).
4. Is it smart to have my own coffee machine in the dorm? Or am I going to hate it after a while because of the smell that can build up? (I have heard the air flow in the dorm is pretty bad, so I am asking this just in case).
5. Is there space to get my own chair for the dorm? (Like a gaming chair)",3,1750560616.0,CarletonU,6,1.0,False

1lhdggy,https://i.redd.it/o42m1hbr5e8f1.jpeg,Breville Barista Express > Bambino Plus > Dual Boiler & Niche Zero,"Wanted to share our experience with these machines in case anyone was interested or it helps someone in the decision making process.

We decided to upgrade our coffee machine (Breville Barista Express) to a separate machine + grinder combo, with a budget of around $900 AUD.

I read through many, many posts on this subreddit, YouTube, and other forums and reviews to determine the best value for money within our price range.

Eventually I decided that the Bambino Plus and the DF54 would be the right choice and a major upgrade to our existing machine. We liked the compact size of both these machines, the price, the appearance and the overall good reviews.

Due to lack of time, we bought the Bambino Plus first and decided to use the grinder in our BBE in the meantime.

Our experience with the Bambino Plus:
In comparison to the BBE, this machine felt much cheaper on first impression. We encountered several issues:
	•	Portafilter attachment - Tightening the portafilter was a horrible experience. As a small female, I felt like I was fighting to keep the machine in place while trying to turn the portafilter into the group head - even after the machine had warmed up and we’d used it a couple of times after turning it on.
	•	Vibration - The vibrations on the drip tray felt like a massive design/functionality flaw to us. We were not using small or light cups, but they were jittering all over the place the second the brew started, moving them away from the spouts and almost dropping off the machine completely. This machine was meant to be more convenient, yet we needed to stand there to hold our cup in place for 30 seconds? We ended up using a silicone mat which helped.
	•	Steam wand inconsistencies - My partner found the auto steam was inconsistent and often created big bubbles (understand it would be hard to get velvety foam but it was frustrating that it wasn’t at least the same each time). I used manual steaming but found the steam wand tip heated the milk a bit too quickly, and it was hard for me to get the milk consistency right.
	•	Espresso inconsistency - The espresso often felt inconsistent too, even with a scale, with different acidity and bitterness, and varying grams of espresso out. But this was whilst using the BBE grinder so that could have been a factor.

We wanted to love the machine, but it had so many downsides that after a month we decided to return it to the store.

Our final setup:
This then led us on our search again, to which we somehow ended up tripling our budget (a bit of a buy once, cry once scenario) and purchasing the Breville Dual Boiler and Niche Zero grinder.

And we have been extremely happy - the coffee has been far better than anything we’ve had from local coffee shops. Once we got the hang of the grind settings, it has been consistent with 18g in and 36g out. The BDB feels well built, heavy, and holds lots of water, and the 3-hole steam wand tip feels perfect - not too slow or fast. The heat up time is just a few minutes (or we use the auto timer for the morning). 

Love the Niche Zero - somehow the grinding sounds satisfying? And it’s been easy to adjust with no retention since the first couple of grinds.
It took us a while to get it right, but it’s been a major upgrade that we hope to use for many years and we’re extremely satisfied with this duo.

TL;DR
	•	Bambino Plus: Didn’t work for our needs despite good reviews (vibration, portafilter issues, inconsistent steaming)
	•	BDB + Niche Zero: Much higher investment but significantly better results and build quality
	•	Worth the extra spend if you’re serious about home espresso

I hope this helps anyone on the fence! ",13,1750560040.0,espresso,5,0.93,False

If anyone has any tips for pulling out flavor notes from washed coffees please let me know. I'm looking for more punch, distinct seperation/clarity, and sweetness if that's possible.

I have pretty severe travel anxiety and I asked him how often he goes and how often he expects his wife to go with him. He mentioned that he wants to go any time there’s a death or wedding and expects his wife to pretty much always go with him. He also loves traveling. I know myself - I’ve always hated staying places that aren’t home. When I have to, I always bring my own bedsheets, towels, etc., but it makes me super anxious regardless and I always try to go home early. It’s especially worse when durning my monthly cycle. I broke it off with him before things progress and it’s even harder to stop seeing each other. I can’t seem to shake the feeling of regret because I think I may have been catching feelings for him. I tell myself I was looking out for my future self but can’t help but feeling heartbroken and having second thoughts. My brain is telling me that this is as the best choice but my heart disagrees. He was very respectful and when I said I don’t think we should proceed, and we wished each other the best. Just wanted to hear your guys’ thoughts",1,1750559406.0,MuslimNikah,1,1.0,False

I get this deep feeling of despair when I see people enjoying life with friends and significant others. Outside my Los Angeles apartment at the pool I see parties going on. I'll sit at one of the chairs nearby just to absorb some of the energy, watching others relish in weekend celebrations. One particular group looked straight out of a sitcom, three beautiful couples in their 30's sipping cocktails and sharing stories about life. They were discussing plans for dinner and checking out an outdoor movie at the park. Just hearing this puts a pit in my stomach; its an evening I wish I could share with people. I do have friends spread around, but we are getting older, and with that comes new commitments, whether it be a wife or a baby or a strenuous job.

I have a decent job in the industry but it's all remote. The most socializing I get is through people online in discords (gross) or going to be local bookstore and coffee shops. And for those latter people, they always seem to contain some impenetrable layer, a veil they refuse to let me see past, as if to keep their social life free of my sclerotic energy.

The reality is these interactions are happening at such large capacities around the world at all times, it would be insane to think I am missing out by not being socially connected at all times. Yet logic doesn't  soothe the profound loneliness that I experience on nights like these. I just know these feelings are exacerbated by our current technological epoch, yet there doesn't seem to be a solution but to try your best to make connections at any moment. All I can do is continue to go outside and observe, perhaps find an opening to talk with a stranger. I've been successful a couple times, but many days are spent in silent observation, absorbing interactions that are not meant for me.

I'm going to go out and get a bite to eat, perhaps drink a beer, and partake once again in these rituals.If nothing comes from it, perhaps I will come home and have another. Worst case scenario I go to bed early, allowing myself an early morning to go out and try again. Anything that will subdue this feeling of missing out.",12,1750559355.0,redscarepod,13,0.8,False
1lhd8fh,https://www.reddit.com/r/German/comments/1lhd8fh/the_dismal_case/,The Dismal Case,"Can someone please give me some tips on when predicting when the Dative case should be used. Genitive, Nomitave, Accusative I have gotten the hand of, but I'd say only 30% of the time I get the Dative right, it's just too confusing for me!

What I know:
If the Object is acting on something, it's dative (Gave -> Book -> Dative) (However the verb 'Help' is kinda odd here)

If someone or something is coming from it (Coffee <- Machine (Dative)) (Baby <- Mother (Dative))

These are really my only tips and no matter what I can't seem to get my head around them",2,1750559299.0,German,4,1.0,False
