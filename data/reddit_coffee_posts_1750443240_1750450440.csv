1lgdr5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lgdr5g/people_pleasers_are_manipulative_and_bad_friends/,People pleasers are manipulative and bad friends,"I firmly believe that people pleasers are just not good people and that people pleasing is a form as immaturity. It keeps one from forming real connections with people. Basically it’s a form of lying and tells a person, that you are not trustworthy. Because who knows if you are really saying what you think, or if you are just saying what I want to hear, just doing what you think I want to do and don’t want to upset me or want to be liked by me, without giving me the option to decide for myself, whether I think you are someone that I like and want to spend more time with. You can’t have discussions with people pleasers, because they will be too scared to upset you. They can’t make decisions, even the tiniest like “where do you want to go for coffee” it’s like being friends with a grown up child. 
And the reason why it is upsetting me this much is that I feel like these days everyone is a people pleaser, at least when it comes to Gen Z (which I am myself) . I just can’t seem to find anyone who is willing to form their own opinion and articulate it, willing to be blunt about their feelings and when a boundary is crossed… like how can I be comfortable to set boundaries when you seem to be fine with people overstepping yours all the time?? 
On top of that, the people I’ve met who had the most people pleasing tendencies were the ones gossiping the most, just nasty complaining about every other person to me. 

If you are making decisions based on what you think is the most agreeable, lie because you are scared of being judged or perceived as a human being with flaws, say yes to things you don’t actually want to do and let people overstep your boundaries to not “inconvenience them”, you are not “nice”, you are manipulative.

Hey there,
I’m a 38-year-old guy from India, working in the ever-thrilling world of IT (read: lots of screens, occasional coffee, and pretending to know what’s broken). Life’s been a bit too routine lately, and I’m hoping to shake that up with some real, meaningful connections, the kind where conversations feel easy and time disappears without us realizing.

I’m not some ultra-talented renaissance man just someone who enjoys deep chats, dry humor, music that hits the soul, and random little moments that make the day better. Bonus points if you have a playful side or don’t mind a bit of light banter now and then.

Looking to meet people who are kind, open, and maybe a bit curious. If you’re someone who enjoys thoughtful convos and the occasional cheeky exchange, I’d love to hear from you.

Shoot me a message or drop a comment if you're up for a chat platonic, flirty, or somewhere in between. Let’s see where it goes.

I should add that I am service industry and have been for the majority of the last 23 years. Maybe that makes my standards higher, but I feel like a basic level of friendliness isn’t an unreasonable expectation…? I’m also a friendly person and try to always treat everyone with respect, so I’m not walking into these places with crazy demands or anything. It just baffles me!

1lgdnwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyComedy/comments/1lgdnwj/what_is_cozy_comedy/,What is Cozy Comedy?,"Cozy comedy literature is a genre that blends the comforting, low-stakes charm of cozy fiction with the light-hearted, often witty tone of comedy. Think of it as the literary equivalent of a warm blanket and a good laugh.

Key Features of Cozy Comedy Literature:

1. Gentle Humor

The comedy tends to be more situational, character-driven, or whimsical rather than edgy or dark. It may involve quirky characters, misunderstandings, or absurd scenarios - but it avoids cynicism.

2. Low-Stakes Plotlines

The conflicts are usually personal or small-scale (e.g., interpersonal mix-ups, a local mystery, or career dilemmas), not global disasters or intense psychological drama.

3. Relatable, Likable Characters

Characters often have quirks, endearing flaws, or offbeat hobbies. The tone invites readers to root for them rather than fear or judge them.

4. Comfortable Settings

These stories often take place in quaint towns, bookshops, coffee houses, or other homey environments. The atmosphere is warm and familiar.

5. Feel-Good Endings

Cozy comedies aim to leave the reader smiling - sometimes with a sense of hope, closure, or quiet triumph.

I’ve been struggling with anxiety and noticed something weird: I’m fine hanging out with friends in familiar places, but when it comes to new or formal events — weddings, restaurants, cafes — I get really anxious or if the thing is planned for later like after few days whatever it is even a small coffee with someone i get so anxious but when its in the moment i just go and feel ok ( last week i  visited a friend’s home 40 mins away and met her parents and stayed for 2h and 0 anxiety)

Logically, I know I can leave anytime and people are busy, but my body still reacts like I’m trapped. Most of the anxiety hits before the event, with racing thoughts and worry about panicking.

I want to say yes to everything again — travel, work, socialize — but feel stuck. I’ve heard SSRIs can help but take weeks and only reduce anxiety partially.

1lgdf0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1lgdf0b/new_cat_stalkingattacking_resident_cat/,New Cat Stalking/Attacking Resident Cat,"Hey yall - it’s been about 3 weeks of trying to introduce my cats, and I know it’s hard, but I’m starting to feel hopeless. 

I’ve had resident cat since she was a kitten. She’s a 3 y/o big eyed sweetheart who is a little small for her age. She’s so social and the biggest cuddlebug. I moved to a new city back in October and have been doing more weekend trips, so I wanted to get her a companion for while I’m away. My entire intention with getting a second cat was to find her a friend. 

The first week the new cat moved in, I had them completely separated - new cat in the bedroom, res cat in the living room (I have a 1bd apartment). I started doing scent swapping, and my res can’t didn’t like it at first but she eventually stopped hissing and didn’t react at all to the smell. 

At this point I tried doing short, supervised interactions, but there was a lot of hissing/growling from res cat which stressed new cat out so we would stop and separate again. I would give them treats and try to pet them both, but when new cat is stressed she gets hella violent (my arms can testify). About two weeks in I swapped their living spaces in hopes that would help, but our short supervised interactions (with lots of treats) continued to be stressful for everyone involved. 

A few days ago I got a screen door to go in between my bedroom and living room. Usually new cat will sit and stare through the doorway looking for food or new cat, while res cat hides in the corner and hisses every time they see new cat. 

I’ve been trying to get them to eat on opposite sides of the door about 10 feet away so they’re forced to at least look at each other, and the last night or two that seemed to go well. This morning res cat was pawing at the screen trying to get out so I figured it might be a good opportunity to try a short supervised introduction again. 

I had res cat in my lap on the couch, she squirmed out of my arms and jumped onto the floor, which new cat took as an opportunity. I could see her squaring up getting ready to pounce, tail twitching, so I start calling her name and poking her in the butt with a toy (because my arms have seem the nasty side of her claws a lot). She just crawled under the coffee table and pounced on res cat 2 seconds later. 

That started the worst fight I’ve seen them have. New cat is chasing res cat all over the living room. Res cat tries to get back to the screen door when she realizes she can’t get through and ends up belly up. New cat jumps onto her and fur goes flying. I end up grabbing res cat and holding her close to get her to stop panicking. But now I’m bleeding, she’s terrified, and as soon as I got her back in my room she hides under some furniture. 

I just don’t know what to do at this point. My plan is to put res cat back in the living room and new cat back in the bedroom once res cat comes out from hiding, but I feel like I’m messing this up. I’ll just continue to keep them separated through the screen door and hope they grow more curious and less violent? I feel like I’ve traumatized my res cat and I don’t know what to do.

Edit: I should clarify that new cat is also SO SWEET when she’s by herself. I’ve even gotten to the point where she’ll rub her head against my cheeks. She only gets violent when she gets close to res cat.",1,1750449366.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False

If you’ve ever stared at your bank app and thought, “Okay, where the hell did it all go?”-you’re not alone. Inflation might be slowing down on paper, but your actual life still feels expensive AF. Whether you’re making $28K a year in a big city or $2,300/month on freelance gigs, saving can feel like a fantasy reserved for people with ergonomic office chairs and meal prep habits.

But here’s the truth: Saving money is possible-even when your income is unpredictable, your rent keeps creeping up, and your idea of a treat is getting guac at Chipotle. You don’t need a six-figure salary. You need a system that’s actually built for the kind of financial life you’re living.

This guide breaks it all down-with budgeting methods that actually work when you’re broke, tools that don’t need bank logins, and real ways to stack cash without grinding your soul into dust.

Let’s start with the budgeting systems that don’t suck.

# Budgeting Strategies That Actually Work on a Low Income

**What’s the most realistic budget system for low earners in 2025?**

If you’ve ever tried to follow a YouTube budgeting video and gave up halfway through because it involved eight spreadsheets, four sinking funds, and vibes-you’re not alone.

The best budgeting system in 2025 for low earners is the one you’ll actually stick to. But here’s what’s winning for real people right now:

* **The “No-Spreadsheet Budget”**: Instead of obsessing over categories, this system sets three basic limits-weekly spending cap, monthly bills, and flex buffer. All tracked in your Notes app or a free budgeting tool like **Oregano** or **Zeta Money Manager**, both of which blew up on TikTok for not requiring bank syncs.
* **The “Reverse Budget”**: Also known as pay yourself first budgeting. Before you spend, you auto-move a set amount (even $10) into savings, then live on what’s left. This is especially helpful when your income is variable or freelance-heavy.

What makes these systems work? **Simplicity**. They don’t rely on you suddenly becoming a spreadsheet person. They rely on habits that feel doable even on your worst week.

“Budgeting isn’t about tracking-it’s about predicting.” - Ramit Sethi, I Will Teach You To Be Rich, Chapter 3

**Zero-based vs. 50/30/20: Which works better if you earn under $30K?**

You’ve probably heard of both:

* **50/30/20 Rule**: You spend 50% on needs, 30% on wants, 20% on savings.
* **Zero-based Budgeting**: Every dollar gets a job. At the end, your income minus expenses = $0.

Here’s the catch: **50/30/20 breaks down hard** if your rent is 60% of your paycheck.

For incomes under $30K, zero-based budgeting often works better-but **only if you keep it loose**. Apps like **EveryDollar** or **YNAB (You Need A Budget)** help you assign each dollar a purpose, but if that’s too intense, a “lite” version on paper or Google Sheets can still change your money game.

Personal tip: When I earned $2,100/month, I tweaked the 50/30/20 rule to **60/10/10/20**\-60% needs, 10% buffer, 10% fun, 20% to savings or debt. It wasn’t perfect, but it stopped me from guilt-spending and helped me build my first $500 emergency fund.

**How to audit your monthly expenses and find “invisible” spending leaks**

This one hurts a little. Not because it’s hard-but because it’s real.

Open your last 2-3 months of transactions. Don’t just look for big stuff. Look for:

* **Micro-subscriptions** you forgot about (free trials that rolled over)
* **Grocery creep** (extra $100/month because of impulse snacks or ordering in)
* **Multiple streaming services** (do you really need Netflix and HBO and Crunchyroll this month?)

Use a highlighter (yes, analog) or a free tool like **Rocket Money** to catch sneaky charges. Most people find **$50–$150/month** in stuff they didn’t know they were still paying for.

Pro tip: Label everything “essential,” “fun,” or “why tho.” That third column reveals everything.

“What gets measured gets managed.” - Peter Drucker, cited in Atomic Habits by James Clear, Chapter 5

**Free budgeting apps that don’t require linking your bank account (2025 roundup)**

If connecting your bank account to a budgeting app feels sketchy (or if you just don’t want your money life on 12 different platforms), here’s what’s working in 2025:

* **Oregano** (iOS/Android): Clean interface, tracks manual inputs, lets you set weekly spending limits. No login needed.
* **Zeta Money Manager**: Perfect for solo or couple budgeting. Offers bank-linking optional, but works great with manual entries.
* **Budgt**: Very Gen Z-friendly UI, no ads, great for gig workers.
* **Notion Budget Templates**: Tons of community-made dashboards that don’t track you-only you track you.

These tools won’t auto-sync, but that’s kind of the point. **Manual input = mindful spending.**

Insight from Your Money or Your Life (Chapter 2): “Tracking where your money goes doesn’t restrict you. It shows you where your freedom is leaking.”

# Smart Ways to Build Savings When You’re Broke

**What is the $5 Rule-and does it actually help you save?**

TikTok loves to romanticize the $5 Rule. But let’s break it down without the aesthetic montages.

**The $5 Rule** = Every time you get a $5 bill, you stash it. No exceptions. No spending it. Just stash.

It started as a cash-only method (think: folding money into a jar), but in 2025, people are adapting it digitally:

* Some use **cash rounding apps** like **Qapital** or **Acorns**, which let you “round up” and stash a few bucks every time you swipe.
* Others create a “fake bill stash” in a savings vault. Every time they’d normally spend $5 on a random coffee or impulse snack, they transfer $5 to a savings goal instead.

Does it work? It can-**but only if you’re consistent.** It’s less about the dollar amount and more about creating a trigger habit. The moment your brain goes “ooh, treat”, you reroute that impulse to a financial win.

I started doing this in college with literal $10 notes, stuffing them into a scratched-up envelope in my sock drawer. I didn’t touch it for months. When I finally opened it, I had $160-money I would’ve sworn I didn’t have.

Behavioral trigger-based saving works because it builds emotional momentum. - Dan Ariely, Predictably Irrational, Chapter 6

**How to automate micro-savings with daily cash rounding (2025 tools)**

Saving when you're broke isn’t about cutting more-**it’s about making saving so tiny it sneaks by your nervous system.**

In 2025, micro-saving apps are leveling up. Here's what’s actually working right now:

* **Qapital** (U.S.): Lets you build custom rules-like rounding up every purchase, saving $1 daily, or transferring $5 every time it rains in your city.
* **Plum** (UK/EU): Uses AI to analyze your spending and auto-saves based on what you can afford that week.
* **Hatch** (India): Designed for low-income savers; it lets you round up UPI payments and auto-move that cash into a savings pot.
* **Copilot Money**: Newer on the scene, but getting love from freelancers who want flexible, rule-based micro-saving without account stress.

Most apps are now built with **AI-based flexibility**, so if your account balance drops too low, they pause the transfers automatically.

And here’s the magic: You don’t see the savings until you go looking. Out of sight = growing in peace.

“Automatic saving is the lazy genius of wealth building.” - Morgan Housel, The Psychology of Money, Chapter 3

**Emergency fund hacks for people who live paycheck to paycheck**

You know you “should” have 3–6 months of expenses saved. But when you’re broke, that feels like someone telling you to climb Everest in flip-flops.

Let’s break that down into something real.

Step 1: Rename the goal

Call it your “Oh Sh\*t Fund.” Seriously. Labeling it with emotional honesty makes it stick. You’re not saving for emergencies. You’re saving to not freak out.

**Step 2: Set a micro-target**

Start with **$250**. That’s enough to cover:

* A phone repair
* Emergency groceries
* A surprise co-pay

Once you hit $250, aim for $500. Then $1,000. Tiny wins = dopamine = motivation.

**Step 3: Make it hard to touch**

Use:

* **Chime’s High-Yield Savings Vault** with auto-sweep
* A **separate bank** you don’t check often (Ally, Capital One, or even a prepaid reloadable card)
* Or the Reddit-approved **“Bank of Mom” method**: Give your trusted person the login, and make them gatekeep your access unless it’s a true emergency.

I used a reloadable card that required a 3-day transfer window. Just long enough to stop me from blowing it on a panic Uber.

“Wealth is the gap between your ego and your income.” - Naval Ravikant, as referenced in The Almanack of Naval Ravikant, Chapter 7

**Can you really save money using cash envelopes in a digital world?**

Yes-but not the way your grandma did it.

**The modern envelope method** works like this:

* Create virtual envelopes in savings apps like **Goodbudget**, **Nudget**, or even **Monzo pots**
* Assign each “envelope” a purpose-like groceries, bills, or Uber money
* Only spend what’s in the envelope. When it’s gone, it’s gone.

For digital natives, this can feel weird at first-but it forces friction. And friction = awareness.

Even TikTokers are doing a “hybrid method” now:

* Cash for daily splurges (coffee, drinks, snacks)

# Low-Income Side Hustles and Passive Income Ideas in 2025

**Which online side hustles are still legit in 2025? (No surveys or scams)**

If you've ever signed up for a “make money fast” site and ended up earning 14 cents for 3 hours of clicking, you already know: most online side hustles are trash.

But in 2025, a few actually legit options still exist-especially if you're broke, tired, and just want something that doesn’t feel like a second job.

Here’s what’s working right now for real people on r/beermoney and r/sidehustle:

* **User Testing Platforms** Sites like [**UserTesting.com**](http://UserTesting.com), **Trymata**, and **PlaybookUX** still pay $5–$25 per test to give feedback on apps, websites, and digital products. Each test takes 10–20 minutes and requires a quiet space + clear communication.
* **AI Prompt Reviews & Feedback** New platforms like **PromptBase** and **PromptLoop** pay users to help improve AI-generated content. Some Reddit users reported earning $100–$200/month part-time by reviewing prompts or selling optimized ones.
* **Freelance Microtasks on Clickworker & Microworkers** These sites are still around-and still pay small amounts for bite-sized tasks like tagging images, filling forms, or reviewing content. Not life-changing, but if you need $15 by Friday, they can work.

Reddit user u/fishbowl-broke: “I’ve been doing $10 a day in user tests during lunch breaks. That’s $300/month. Pays for gas and groceries.”

None of these will replace your full-time job-but they’re not scams. And they’re **a lot better than burning out on another fake crypto MLM slide deck.**

From Deep Work by Cal Newport, Chapter 2: “Work that is cognitively demanding yet low-volume creates the highest rewards over time.”

**Can AI tools really help you earn extra income with zero upfront cost?**

Short answer: **Yes, if you use them right.**

AI in 2025 isn’t just about chatbots and Midjourney memes. It's become a toolset for making money smarter-not harder.

Here’s how low-income earners are cashing in without upfront investment:

* **AI Writing Assistants** Use free tools like **Notion AI**, **Claude**, or **ChatGPT Free Tier** to help write eBooks, resumes, or basic web copy for clients. Paired with free Fiverr gigs or Reddit skill swaps, it’s a real side hustle.
* **Auto-generated Digital Products** Tools like **Kittl**, **Canva AI**, and **Promptly** let you generate templates, journal pages, or planners-then sell them on Gumroad or Etsy.
* **AI-Powered Tutoring** Platforms like **Quazel AI** or [**Fictionary.ai**](http://Fictionary.ai) help non-native speakers learn English. You can register as a helper or reviewer and earn passive tips.

None of this requires a degree. Just consistency, a laptop, and a weekend learning curve.

From The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss, Chapter 8: “You don’t need to invent. You need to improve and repurpose what already exists.”

**How Reddit users are making $100+/month from digital printables and templates**

This one’s weirdly underrated. If you’ve ever made a Notion template, budget tracker, or cute habit calendar-**you’re sitting on cash.**

Redditors on r/sidehustle have been reporting real results selling:

* **Notion templates** (for students, ADHD routines, or freelancers)
* **Printable planners** (monthly, wedding, fitness)
* **Digital sticker packs** (for Goodnotes, Apple Notes, or Android tablets)

How it works:

1. Make your product using **Canva**, **Notion**, or **Affinity Designer**
2. Upload it to **Etsy**, **Payhip**, or **Gumroad**
3. Promote lightly via Pinterest, Reddit, or TikTok

User u/plannerwitch posted:

“I started with one ADHD planner. Made $18 in the first week. Now it’s $120/month, hands-off.”

No physical inventory. No shipping. You create it once-it sells forever.

From Show Your Work by Austin Kleon, Chapter 5: “The best way to get noticed is to do good work and put it where people can find it.”

**Real examples of side gigs that don’t require a degree or big time commitment**

Let’s close this out with truly low-barrier side gigs that real people are using to earn money without a second job or fancy skills.

Here’s what’s working in 2025:

* **Dog walking & pet sitting via Rover or Meowtel** Especially in cities, rates can hit $20–$50 per visit. If you’ve got time and a calm vibe, this is easy money.
* **Facebook Marketplace flips** Buy cheap/free items locally, clean them up, and resell. Start with books, lamps, or kitchen gadgets.
* **TaskRabbit gigs** From furniture assembly to grocery runs, people are earning $100–$400/month by doing just 2–4 small jobs a week.
* **Local babysitting & house sitting** Still alive and thriving. Use [**Care.com**](http://Care.com) or post in **Buy Nothing groups** to find families in your area.

These aren’t passive. But they’re not soul-crushing either. And for a lot of people, they’re the bridge between just surviving and actually building cushion.

# Saving on Essentials Without Sacrificing Quality of Life

**How to cut your grocery bill in half using 2025’s top discount apps**

Groceries in 2025 are still wildly expensive-even when you’re shopping “cheap.” Eggs are stable (finally), but the price of fresh produce and snacks keeps creeping up. If you’ve ever walked into a store for “just a few things” and left $60 poorer… yeah, same.

Here’s what’s actually helping people cut grocery costs in half right now:

* **Flashfood** (U.S. & Canada): Lets you buy food nearing its sell-by date for up to 50% off. Big in cities with Meijer, Giant, or Stop & Shop.
* **Too Good To Go** (U.S., UK, Europe): Rescues unsold food from bakeries and cafes. You grab a “surprise bag” for $4–$6 worth $12–$18.
* **Basket**: Compares real-time prices across your local grocery stores. Reddit users say they’ve saved $10–$30/month just by checking the app before shopping.
* **India-specific?** **Magicpin** and **JioMart offers** are trending for localized grocery and D2C discounts.

Smart grocery hacks also include:

* Always eating before shopping (proven to cut impulse spending)
* Sticking to a max item count, not dollar count
* Buying frozen or canned when fresh is overpriced

“Small daily choices compound into real financial wins.” - James Clear, Atomic Habits, Chapter 1

Cheapest phone, internet, and utility plans for low-income users (U.S.-focused)

Your phone bill doesn’t have to be $80/month. Your internet doesn’t need to eat your rent buffer. And yes, you can get quality service without signing a blood pact with the big providers.

**Cheapest legit phone plans in 2025:**

* **Tello Mobile**: $10–$25/month for unlimited talk/text + 1–5GB. Runs on T-Mobile’s network.
* **Visible by Verizon**: $25 flat for unlimited everything. No contract.
* **US Mobile**: Custom plans, as low as $12/month. Good for minimal users.

**Low-cost internet options:**

* **Xfinity Essentials**: $9.95/month if you qualify (SNAP, Medicaid, etc.)
* **AT&T Access**: $10/month, plus free modem rental.
* **Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)**: Offers up to $30/month off your bill. Ends 2025 unless renewed-apply while it’s hot.

**Utility-saving tip:** Sites like **BillFixers** or **Truebill** will negotiate your bills for you. You just upload the PDF or login credentials and let them do the haggling.

“Cutting recurring costs frees up money every single month-for years.” - Vicki Robin, Your Money or Your Life, Chapter 6

**How to negotiate bills-even if you hate confrontation**

If you get anxious even calling to cancel a subscription, negotiating your bills probably sounds like a nightmare. But in 2025, you don’t need to talk to a human (thank god).

Try these **non-confrontational negotiation methods**:

* **Use negotiation bots like Trim or Cushion**: They’ll contact your providers (phone, internet, insurance) and haggle for better rates.
* **Script it out**: If you do call, use this: “Hi, I’m reviewing my budget and noticed I’m paying more than expected. Can you check if I’m eligible for any current promotions or lower plans?”
* **Leverage competition**: Mention a cheaper provider by name. Example: “I saw Tello offers $10 for the same coverage. Can you match that?”

I negotiated my own internet down from $70 to $40/month using just one live chat and a fake pause that made them panic-offer a retention deal.

**Reddit pro move:** Call at the end of the month when reps are trying to hit quota. You’ll hear better offers.

From Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss, Chapter 3: “People will fight to the death to keep from feeling ripped off-but give them a reason to say ‘yes,’ and they’ll often surprise you.”

**Can you live frugally and be happy? Reddit-approved lifestyle swaps**

Living on less doesn’t have to mean less life. If your current vibe is “broke but healing,” here are real swaps that people on Reddit swear by-and not one of them feels like punishment.

**Swap #1: Solo coffee shop workdays → Library + iced coffee from home**

* Vibe maintained. $8 saved each visit. More focus, too.

**Swap #2: Streaming overload → One service/month rotation**

* Pick one. Rotate monthly. You get fresh content and save $30–$50/month.

**Swap #3: Uber everywhere → Monthly transit pass + walking podcast**

* You’ll move more. Save up to $150/month. Bonus: fewer awkward driver convos.

**Swap #4: Restaurant weekends → Cook-at-home challenge + themed nights**

* Redditors on r/EatCheapAndHealthy share recipes that hit under $3/serving. Think spicy noodles, sheet pan tacos, and air fryer wings.

Living frugally isn’t about deprivation-it’s about trade-offs. And when the trade gives you more freedom, more peace, or even just a little breathing room… it’s a win.

# FAQ: Real Answers to the Most-Googled Saving Questions in 2025

**How much should I save per month if I’m living paycheck to paycheck?**

Short answer: **Anything. Literally anything.**

Forget the “save 20% of your income” rule if it makes you want to scream. That advice was built for people with disposable income, not folks juggling rent, groceries, and a car that makes a weird noise when it rains.

Instead, pick a number you can hit every week-even if it’s just $3. That’s $12/month. That’s still saving.

Realistic targets based on current Reddit threads and behavioral research:

* **$5/week** = $260/year (micro-savings mindset)
* **$20/paycheck** = $480/year (emergency fund starter level)
* **10% of any “extra” income** = guilt-free spending with a built-in cushion

“You don’t get rich by saving more. But you do get stability. And that matters even more when you're broke.” - Ramit Sethi, I Will Teach You to Be Rich, Chapter 4

**Is $1,000 enough for an emergency fund in 2025?**

Honestly? **It’s a solid start-but not always enough.**

With inflation-adjusted costs in 2025, $1,000 can still cover:

* One month of basic groceries
* An urgent dental visit
* Rent buffer in case of late paychecks

But here’s the real hack: **Break it down into milestones.**

Reddit’s r/personalfinance calls this the “$500–$1,000–$3,000 method”:

* First $500 = ""I won’t panic if my tire pops.""
* $1,000 = ""I won’t panic if my hours get cut.""
* $3,000+ = ""I’m starting to breathe.""

Stats to ground it: According to the latest Federal Reserve Survey on Economic Wellbeing (2025), **37% of Americans still can't cover a $400 emergency** without borrowing. That means if you’ve got even $200 in a savings pot, you’re already ahead of millions.

From The Psychology of Money, Chapter 10: “Saving is the gap between your ego and your income. It has little to do with how much you make, and a lot to do with how you behave.”

**Can I save money even while I’m in debt?**

Yes. **And you should.**

It sounds backward, but here’s why it works:

* Emergencies don’t pause just because you’re paying off a credit card.
* A small emergency fund prevents you from adding more debt when life hits.
* Saving-even $10/month-gives you **mental breathing room**, which reduces the burnout spiral that debt often creates.

Recommended approach:

* Save your first **$250–$500** before going all-in on debt payoff
* Then do a **split strategy**: 80% of “extra” goes to debt, 20% to savings
* Use the **debt snowball** (smallest to largest) or **avalanche** (highest interest first) depending on your motivation style

I was $9,400 in credit card debt in 2021 and still saved $20/month in an auto-sweep account. That account kept me from panicking when I needed new tires. It was tiny-but it saved me from another $300 of interest.

From Your Money or Your Life, Chapter 7: “When you build savings, you’re buying your freedom back-one dollar at a time.”

**Should I still try to invest if I can barely save?**

This one gets spicy opinions, but here’s the honest take: **No, not until your savings habit is stable.**

Investing is powerful-but it only works when:

* You won’t need to pull that money out next month
* You’ve got at least a tiny emergency fund
* Your debt isn’t crushing you with 20%+ interest

Instead:

1. Build a $500–$1,000 savings base
2. Pay down high-interest debt (above 10%)
3. THEN start investing small-think $10–$20/month in an index fund through apps like **Fidelity Spire**, **SoFi Invest**, or **Groww (India)**

Because investing while broke isn’t about building wealth-**it’s about hope.** And hope with no safety net can become pressure instead of power.

From The Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins, Chapter 4: “The market is a powerful wealth builder-but only when you let it work over time, without interruption.”

This is your blueprint. Whether you’re earning $2,000 a month or juggling gigs just to break even, you now have the tools, tricks, and truth bombs to start saving, without shame.

I hit the weights, broke a good sweat, and decided to unwind in the sauna. Nothing out of the ordinary, right? Well, that's where everything went sideways.

I walk in and there's this massive black guy sitting there, probably early 30s, with a towel barely covering his junk. Now, I've seen big dudes before, but this dude's cock was like something out of a porno... he is comically large. I couldn't help but look over and do a double-take. It's a sauna, we're all in towels, but this thing was practically poking out. 

I sit down a few seats away, trying not to stare, and that's when it hits me, the heat and the awkwardness. So, I go for a sip of water and, I don't know why, I just blurted out, ""Damn, you could use that thing to stir your coffee!"" Stupid, I know. But I didn't mean any harm. It was just a dumb, off-hand remark to break the tension.

This guy, he goes full Hulk on me. He stands up, towel falls, and he's got his hand around my throat before I can even process what's happening. I'm choking, trying to apologize, and all he says is, ""Fuck you, white boy. Next time, I'll make you lick my taint."" And then he lets go like it's no big deal.

I'm coughing, gasping for air, and feeling like the smallest, most embarrassed person on the planet. I report him to the gym owner, who's a good guy, and he takes it seriously. Dude's banned for life. But now I'm sitting here, wondering if I'm the asshole. Was my comment that bad? Should I have just kept my mouth shut? Did I deserve what happened?

It's supposed to be next week, but now I'm wondering if I should just cancel it. Small backstory, he thinks I'm hot. I like the way he looks. We spoke a couple months ago, but he doesn't bottom, despite him saying he was vers. This was a dealbreaker apparently. This week I messaged him again, and we hit it off I guess? We had a conversation about desirability politics, etc. Given that we're both men of color in the south. I did ask him what type of latino he is. He said he didn't feel comfortable answering that. Then he asked me why I was asking that question. I told him I have Latin family members (I've also been with a few different latin men, cuban, mexican, costa rican, pr). I thought it was odd that he wouldn't tell me the specific nationality. Normally I do have a rule I go by: no latin men. But I figure, we seem to be compatible, so why rule a guy out. Be a little more open-minded. Get to know somebody first. There's more we can do than just penetrative sex. 

He said he'd been fetishized in the past, I said as a black man I can relate. Then he kinda just talked about his experience as a latin guy in a ""majority white"" area.

Anyway, I sent over my facepics 2 days ago. Which he had seen before and called me hot. By this point we had already scheduled the date. Nothing serious, just a coffee shop. I'm the one who asked. I asked when he was free next week. He thought it was different that I actually ask because most guys can't plan ahead to save their lives. I told him my schedule was busy and I couldn't do ""right now"". Plus he lives an hour away and that would give me time to shower and get ready. So we settled on a date and a time for next week. But I noticed he hadn't responded to the facepics, and it shows he was on the app a few hours ago. But hadn't responded in 2 days. I hadn't reached out either. I figure, he saw the facepics, had a chance to respond. Let him go. And it shows he read the facepics too.

He also talked about how hard it was to find a good/decent guy. We seemed to be on the same page as far as what we're into, condoms, etc. I def think his body is nice, which I did communicate to him. But the ghosting for 2 days after a long conversation does send a clear message. And now I'm wondering if I should cancel my date with hm. Overall, he seemed.......lukewarm. He didn't seem aloof, but also didn't seem too excited. Almost kinda cold. And now I'm wondering if I should just cancel it ahead of time.",0,1750449068.0,askgaybros,1,0.5,False

Important info: my anxiety is not the racing thoughts, tight chest, hyperventilating sort. It’s what ChatGPT has described as “somatic panic disorder with visceral focus”, or as I like to call it, a pain in the peach that gives me almost instant food poisoning symptoms - severe nausea, throwing up, stomach cramps, diarrhea, inability hot flushes, severe shaking. This limits me so much because even the thought of needing to go buy groceries or take myself down the road for a coffee with a friend can bring this mess on, which means I don’t have much of a life. 

My GP has predominantly used Espiride and low dose Xanax to treat the attacks over the years, to greater and lesser success - at my lowest I was nauseated constantly, could hardly eat, and weighed only 43kg despite trying my best. Most recently I went to a psychiatrist who put me on lexapro promising it would cure my anxiety. It really did help so much with the anxiety, I stopped getting panic attacks and it was amazing! But then I got intense adhd symptoms along with sudden intense dizzy spells, and the adhd vibes were so bad I couldn’t focus on work, had daily breakdowns and ended up losing my wfh job. He even prescribed me Ritalin, that’s how bad it got. Unfortunately it was the lexapro turning me into an adhd demon, so I had to come off. Then he put me on something called indoblok, and guess what’s back? The gut curdling nausea, the cramps, the random days I literally can’t function because I’m too sick from anxiety. 

I talked to ChatGPT about it asking about similar meds to lexapro, and it suggested Buspar and mirtazapine. Does anyone with stomach-focused anxiety attacks use either of these? Need some ideas to give to my doc when I see him next week because the indoblok isn’t helping at all, but would love to hear from people who actually have experience using them rather than my doc throwing whatever sticks at me.

Before i get hated on ik i shouldve been more careful and im currently taking all the steps to ensure something like this never happens again.

I have never failed a drug screening, completed all my classes and community service, never violated. all i have left is the fines and my last 4 months of probation time.

Today i was called in for my monthly screening (UA), i used the certo method and drank a shit ton of coffee to prevent dilution. Im not asking if i passed or failed a test, simply wondering if anyone has any experience w a positive in this specific county. I took the test it wasnt clear so i dont think it counted towards dilution and the po doing the test said “looks good you can dump it”. Ik on the paper you fill out every time before taking a test it has a list of drugs and the officer will bubble in if it was positive or negative…

If i was hypothetically positive would they send it to the lab to get confirmation in my county? Is it possible that later down the road at my next meeting i get arrested for 3-5 days(thats judge order time for violation on paper) just looking for other opinions on how to tell if im rlly “looking good” or need to request a retest in the future.",1,1750448750.0,dui,1,1.0,False

Just dropped our latest update with brand new interiors!

Getting various cockpits for the different mech classes has been super high up the list for us and we're finally there. Honestly as a mech game this is what we love to do more than anything. Produce unique and inspiring mech piloting experiences.

Light Cockpit & Heavy Cockpit – Incoming!
Cockpit Additions
New Light-Class Cockpit
-The Light Cockpit is for pilots who move fast, hit hard, and vanish before the dust settles.
-200° Bubble Screen HUD Near-panoramic vision for maximum situational awareness. See all evade all.
-Stripped Down to the Brass. Minimal armor, zero excess weight. You’ll feel like you're flying a jet engine with joysticks. Agile, Fast, Exposed Accelerates harder, corners tighter, but takes hits like a paper kite. Ideal for scouting, flanking, or fast-cap missions.
-Best For:
Solo strikes, scout roles, and pilots who don’t miss.

New Heavy-Class Cockpit
-Built like a bank vault with a trigger, the Heavy Cockpit is designed for dominance and long-haul engagements with reinforced plating-designed for front‑line durability.
-Reinforced Slit-style Screen Offers narrow but ultra-protected visibility-less screen, more survival. Perfect for holding lines under fire and absorbing splash damage.
-Built-In Living Quarters Integrated coffee maker, rations locker, and fold-down bunk. Because when you're the last mech standing, comfort matters.
-Best For:
Siege ops, objective holds, and last-mech-standing scenarios.
Taking hits so your squad doesn’t have to.

Massive Visual Overhaul – Lighting Reforged

-This update also brings a total overhaul to how light behaves across the battlefield and inside the cockpit.
Real-Time Reflections
-Cockpit interior surfaces now reflect the world around you—gunfire, muzzle flashes, and objects from outside now alter the lighting on your mech.
-World-Driven Interior Lighting
Your cockpit now feels connected to the battlefield. As ambient lighting floods your cabin and interacts with the space around you dramatically raising emersion.

I wasn’t planning to buy this house. Not really. It was one of those late-night online listings you click on when you can't sleep. A foreclosure in a quiet rural town. Cheap. Too cheap.

But after the breakup, I needed a place. And this one had four walls, a roof, and no questions asked. So I packed everything I owned into a U-Haul and drove across two states. I moved in three days ago. And last night, I found the diary.

Page 2
It was in the crawl space under the stairs. I only went down there because something was scratching at the floorboards.

I thought it might be a raccoon or maybe rats. But when I opened the little wooden door and shined my flashlight, there was nothing. Just dust, cobwebs... and the notebook.

A leather-bound journal, almost new. Not a speck of dust on it.

Page 3
I should have left it alone. I know that now.

The first entry was dated March 3rd, 2020:

“Something moved in the walls last night. Not mice. Something bigger. I called the exterminator. He laughed and said the house was clean. But I still hear it. Scratching. Whispering.”
I closed the book and shoved it back in the crawl space.

But curiosity is louder than fear.

Page 4
That night, I heard it too.

Not rats. Not plumbing. Something dragging across the inside of the wall. Slow. Deliberate.

Like fingertips.

I didn't sleep.

In the morning, I pulled the diary out again. I read the next few pages.

Page 5
“March 7th.
It watched me through the vent. I saw the shadow. I left cheese on a plate by the wall, hoping to lure it out. When I came back, the cheese was gone. And there was something written on the plate. Scratched into the ceramic: ‘I’m hungry.’”

Page 6
I don’t know why I kept reading. Maybe because I wanted to prove it was fake. Just some prank.

But the entries kept getting worse.

“March 12th.
It doesn’t like light. It waits until after 3 a.m. I see it in my dreams now. It opens its mouth too wide. Its eyes are empty, but it still watches.”

Page 7
I tried calling the realtor. No answer. Then I looked up the property records.

The last owner’s name was Lena Moretz. I Googled it.

She’d been missing since March 2020.

Presumed dead.

They never found a body.

Page 8
Last night, I woke up with dirt under my fingernails.

I don’t remember going outside.

I checked the front door. It was locked from the inside.

But the crawl space door was open.

The diary was on the floor beside my bed.

Page 9
I know this sounds insane. I took pictures of the diary, sent them to my sister. She told me to burn it.

So I did.

I went out to the fire pit in the backyard, lit it up. Watched it turn to ash.

Then, around 3:30 a.m., I heard it again.

Whispering from the walls.

It said my name.

Page 10
Today I found another notebook.

Same leather cover. Same handwriting.

First entry dated tomorrow:

“June 21st, 2025.
He burned the first one. Doesn’t matter. I’m already inside.”

Page 11
I’m losing time.

I went to the grocery store and came back with nothing but raw meat. I don’t remember picking it out.

The bag was torn open. Something had clawed it.

I haven’t seen my reflection in two days.

The mirrors are still there… but they don’t show me.

Page 12
“June 23rd.
He tried to leave. The tires were slashed. He’ll try the front door next. But the house won’t let him.”
I didn’t write that.

But it was in my handwriting.

Page 13
The power went out last night. No storm, no warning.

The lights flickered just before 3 a.m. Then everything went black.

In the silence, I heard footsteps upstairs.

I live alone.

Page 14
I checked every room. Nothing.

Then I saw it: a figure in the hallway mirror. Tall. Thin. Wrong.

It didn’t move like a person. It twitched—like it was trying to remember how to be human.

And its face was… my face.

Page 15
“June 24th.
I’m in the walls now. I like it here. The house is warm. Familiar. He still thinks he’s in control. He’s wrong.”

Page 16
The diary pages won’t stop appearing.

I threw one into the garbage disposal. The next day, I found it under my pillow.

The entry read:

“Stop that. Or I’ll make you watch.”

Page 17
I saw my neighbor today. She looked at me like I was a stranger.

She said, “You look just like the last guy who lived there.”

When I asked her about Lena Moretz, she said:

“Lena was the one before him.”

Page 18
I think the diary is writing itself now.

The entries predict my day before it happens. Sometimes it’s little things:

“He will spill his coffee.”
Other times, it’s worse:

“Tonight, he screams.”

Page 19
I tried writing my own entry. One that ends with me getting out.

The diary laughed.

The next page just read:

“Nice try.”

Page 20
I’m posting this here because I need someone to know.

This house doesn’t want an owner. It wants a host.

If you find a leather diary in a place that should be empty—don’t open it. Don’t read it.

And whatever you do, don’t listen when it says your name.

Because once it knows your name…

It never forgets.

Their basic profile is Ivy-educated, both undergrad and MBA(was recruited athlete), and worked in PE and IB before starting B school. These are some basic questions I came up with, and I was wondering if they are all right to ask.

How was (insert high school) while you were a student? Do you know about all the renovations and stuff that are going on? I am just trying to break the ice and find out a little about what campus was like for him 10+ years ago and tell him about what it's like today

What made you realize that you wanted to go into finance? Was it influenced by the schools you were recruited by and, eventually, the school you went to?- I want to play a varsity sport in college, and so I wanted to ask this to get a little info about just his mindset while trying to be recruited and also how he ultimately chose the school he wanted to go to

How did you maximize the opportunity you were given by going to an Ivy League school while in college? Did it play a significant role in why you decided to do PE and IB?- Again, figure out his mindset while in undergrad.

What's the ultimate goal after working in high finance and attending B school? What do you want to do in the next 5 years?- Find out about his career goals and ask him about what he sees a life working in finance being for him

Is there anyone you personally looked to for advice while in high school, undergrad, or even now? How important is it to you to talk to people and have a good mental while doing this work?- See if he has any mentors and discuss mental health in this line of work. See how he personally deals with stress

Are there any skills you would recommend I learn or do right now as a rising sophomore wanting to go into finance as a below-average student  looking to vastly improve my GPA (3.3 )

•My Plot Suggestions


•1

A pirate au where character A is tourist and is just an average joe on a little vacation when they get kidnapped by character B who is a pirate

A pirate au and the plot could be two pirate captain enemies who are always at each other’s throats gets captured by the Royal Navy and help each other escape prison before they could get hung for their crimes



•6

Character A moved into a really old house. It probably dates back in 1800’s however it’s nicely renovated. Throughout the only first three days of living there character A quickly noticed strange things happening around the house. Eventually character A meets Character B, a ghost who was the first person to live in the house. They become good friends and character B shows character A the afterlife



•7

Character A is a prince/princess who is being trained to be so prim and proper but all they want is to live a normal life.

Character A has to deal with living in the time they are and figure out a way back home. Character B is from that time period and rescues A from a bad situation



•9

Character A lived a normal boring life. They werent well off but had enough that they werent struggling. Their parent had never told them that before they had even been born they were promised to another. Now on their 18th bday they are told that they are going to be marrying someone that they never met. Character B from their viewpoint had lived much the same as character A just the fact that they were the leader of a barbarian people(or supernatural creature). Neither were excited for the marriage but agreed only to please parents/people. How will these two who never met react to being thrown together?



•10

Taking place in Transylvania, character A is a human who is a princess/prince that is heading to Bran to marry a prince/princess to become the new queen/king. On the way there they end up off course and completely lost some how and end up deeper in the forest(if you wanna be character A you can pick how). Lost for a few days wondering this forest character A finds shelter at what they think is an abandoned castle. Turns out the castle is home to character B, a four hundred year old vampire. Pissed about having an intruder in their castle and the fact if word gets out about their home character B would be killed character B holds character A prisoner forever.



•11

Muse A is a skilled assassin hired by Muse B, a noble lord, to hunt down Muse C, a rival lord who has committed treason and stolen valuable artifacts. 



•12

Muse A thinks they’re the last person on earth when the entire population got wiped out by some virus. But little did they know Muse B also survived and is just the biggest pain in the ass 



•13

Either muse A is forcibly sent to the military (drafted in some war whatever) or willing goes to the military. Where in war they meet muse B, someone from the opposing side and become close to the them in secret 



•14

Takes place in Salem 1692 during the witch trails. And muse A is a witch/sorcerer who fronts as an honest business owner running a coffee/tea shop. And muse B is their new employee they hired

Muse A Is a mob boss. And everyone in the small village knows them but fears them too much, they have too much political influence that cops won’t touch them. It’s known they go to confession every Saturday as a habit, they’ve been doing so since they were able to see over the altar. But when the priest dies of old age a younger priest,Muse B takes over the parish. Prepared for everything but the criminal confessions he’s about to hear every Saturday like clock work.

Here’s some of my writing to give you an idea of how I  write. This is what my large replies can look like. 

———-———-———-———-———-———-———-——

Tony harshly typed on the keys of his keyboard. The force rattled his screen and the sound of the keys clacking filled the lonely office. His anger was rising every passing second. It wasn’t much longer before he couldn’t take it anymore, this needed to be done now. And this has to be done by his hand, and his hand alone.There was no time to plan, no time to stalk. It’s about time he actually indulges in one of his dark impulses head on for once and not puppeteer someone to do it for him. He stood up and snatched his keys from the top of desk before marching down the large grand stair case, his loud footsteps echoing through the large hall, descending down into the foyer. 

He wants nothing more than to break that man’s neck and leave him to rot in a ravine somewhere. He swung his door open and slammed it shut behind him as he made his way to his car. Again he swung the door open but to his car and slammed it shut after he was in. He started the car sped out the driveway. 

The tires squealing and burning a black mark into a pavement as he pulled into the road. Not bothering following the rules of the road he made his way to the man’s home first. 

Figuring it’s more than likely a slob like him would be alone in his own home rather than have taken some woman home or go to some woman’s home. What woman in her right mind would go anywhere near that greasy fuck anyway!? He shamelessly parked in front of the guy’s house and got out, walking around the car. He threw the trunk open and grabbed a crow bar and a very large burlap sack before slamming the trunk. 

All of his vehicles are equipped with said items along with cinder blocks, ropes, chains, a few guns and ammo, just never know when you need to whack someone and clean up the mess. 
He controlled his heavy rage filled breathing as he made his way to the door and harshly knocked on the door. Any harder he would’ve punched a hole through it

———-———-———-———-———-———-———-——

And here’s what my more common and smaller replies look like. Though I do try my best to match my RP partner’s energy 

———-———-———-———-———-———-———-——

Tony smiled tightly at the man despite the blatant unprovoked disrespect.“Sì of course” he nodded “Please lemme take a look around” he said before just walking in anyway. He can’t control himself anymore, it was enough pretending. The visual of Ava getting assaulted kept being relayed in his head thanks to seeing this breathing pile of shit in person. Which had Jekyll losing to Hyde. He closed the door behind him calmly and locked it. He suddenly whipped the crowbar across the man’s face as hard as he could

1lgcpwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lgcpwk/i_always_thought_understanding_birds_was_my/,"I always thought understanding birds was my secret. Then one of them told me their ""Master"" was looking for me.","I have a secret. It’s not something I chose, or learned, or even something I can explain. It’s just… part of me. Always has been, as far back as I can remember. I can understand birds.

And not just birds, really. Anything that flies with feathers. Pigeons cooing on a ledge, sparrows chattering in a bush, even the distant cry of a hawk circling overhead – it all translates in my mind. It’s not like hearing English, or any human language. It’s more direct, a raw feed of emotion, intent, and simple, primal thoughts. ""Hunger."" ""Danger."" ""Warm sun, good."" ""Nest safe."" That kind of thing.

It sounds crazy, I know. That’s why I’ve never told a soul. Not my parents, not my friends when I had them. It’s the kind of thing that gets you locked up, or at least stared at with that pitying look people reserve for the harmlessly insane. So, I kept it quiet. My own private, feathered world.

And honestly? Most of the time, I loved it. It made the world feel richer, more alive. I'd sit in the park and listen to the intricate, soap-opera dramas of the local pigeon flock. I'd laugh at the squabbles between sparrows over a dropped crumb. The anxious chirps of a mother robin telling her fledglings to stay put were as clear to me as any human conversation. Even the guttural, ominous caws of crows held a certain dark poetry. They were always talking about death, about watching, about ancient, forgotten things. Creepy, sure, but fascinating.

Another strange thing: birds aren't scared of me. Not in the way they are of other humans. They’ll land closer. They won't scatter when I walk by. Sometimes, if I sit still enough, they’ll even hop right up to me, their little black eyes regarding me with a strange sort of recognition. It’s like they know I’m listening. That I’m… different.

When I moved out of my parents’ place and got my own little apartment in the city, the first thing I did was set up a bird feeder on my windowsill. It was on the third floor, overlooking a small patch of struggling city trees. It became my sanctuary. I’d sit there for hours, sipping coffee, just listening to the daily news of the avian world. It made the loneliness of city life more bearable.

Then, about a month ago, things started to get weird.

It began with a small bird. A common house finch, nothing remarkable about it. It landed on my feeder, pecked at the seeds, took a sip of water. Standard stuff. But then, it started to vocalize. And what it said sent a chill down my spine.

It wasn't the usual ""good seed, safe place"" chatter. This was different. It was a repetitive, almost robotic series of sounds that translated in my head as:

""Master said find human. Master wants human.""

It just kept saying it, over and over, its little head bobbing. ""Master said find human. Master wants human.""

I froze. My blood ran cold. In all my years of understanding them, I’d never heard anything like this. Their communications were always immediate, instinctual. This was… a message. A directive. And the word ""Master""… that wasn't a concept I'd ever encountered in their simple world.

A wave of unease washed over me. This wasn't right. This was deeply, fundamentally wrong. My first instinct was to shoo it away, to pretend I hadn’t heard it. But another, stronger impulse took over. Curiosity, yes, but also a dawning sense of dread. What did it mean? Who was this ""Master""?

I decided to keep the bird. I know, it sounds cruel, but I had to understand. I had an old, small decorative birdcage from a thrift store. I carefully coaxed the finch inside with some more seeds. It didn't struggle much, which was also unusual.

For the next three days, that bird was my obsession. I set the cage on my kitchen table and just watched it, listened to it. It barely ate. It barely drank. All it did was repeat that same, chilling phrase, hour after hour, its little voice a constant, unnerving mantra in my silent apartment. ""Master said find human. Master wants human."" It was driving me insane. I wasn’t sleeping well. Every time I closed my eyes, I’d hear that tiny, insistent voice.

I tried to reason with it, which felt absurd. ""Who is your Master?"" I'd ask the empty air. ""What human does he want?"" The finch just stared back with its blank, black eyes and repeated its line.

By the third night, I was at my wit's end. I hadn't learned anything. I was just torturing myself and the bird. I decided I’d had enough. I’d release it in the morning. Let it go back to its ""Master,"" whoever or whatever that was. I just wanted it out of my apartment, out of my head.

I went through my usual nighttime routine, trying to shake off the unease. Brushed my teeth, checked the locks. I turned off the living room light, plunging the apartment into darkness save for the glow of streetlights filtering through the blinds. I was just about to head to my bedroom when I heard it.

A sound from my window. Not the finch in its cage. A different sound. A soft, scraping sound, like claws on glass.

My heart leaped into my throat. I crept towards the window, my bare feet silent on the cheap linoleum. I peered through a gap in the blinds.

And I saw it.

Perched on my narrow windowsill, right outside the glass, was a hawk.

Not a small kestrel or a sparrowhawk. This was a big one. A red-tailed hawk, its feathers dark and mottled in the gloom, its hooked beak a cruel slash, and its eyes… its eyes were fixed directly on me. They were a piercing, intelligent yellow, and they glowed with an unnatural intensity in the darkness. It wasn't just looking at the window; it was looking into the room, at me. There was a predatory stillness about it that was utterly terrifying. Hawks don’t just land on third-story city windowsills at night.

I took a hesitant step closer. The hawk didn't flinch. It just watched me, its head cocked slightly. And then it let out a cry. Not the usual wild, piercing shriek of a raptor. This was different. It was a sound that vibrated in my bones, and the meaning of it hit me with the force of a physical blow.

""I found him, Master! Another one like you! I found him!""

My blood turned to ice. Another one like me? Before I could even process the horror of that, before I could even begin to comprehend what it meant, there was a sharp, sudden knock at my apartment door.

BAM-BAM-BAM.

I jumped, a choked cry escaping my lips. My apartment building was old; sound traveled. But this knock was loud, insistent, and utterly out of place at this hour. Who could possibly be at my door? I didn't get visitors. Ever.

My legs felt like lead, but I forced myself to move. I crept to the door, my heart hammering against my ribs so hard I thought it would break. I put my eye to the peephole.

Standing in the dim, flickering light of the hallway was a figure. Tall, cloaked in a dark hoodie that shadowed their face. They were wearing a plain white medical mask, the kind you see everywhere these days, but on them, in this context, it looked sinister. Menacing.

As I watched, trembling, the figure leaned in. Their eye, dark and unreadable, suddenly filled the entire peephole, inches from my own. I recoiled, stifling a scream.

Then, a voice came through the door. It was muffled by the mask, but it was clear, calm, and laced with a chilling, almost playful intimacy.

""Hello in there,"" the voice said. ""No need to be frightened. I know you can hear me. And I know you can hear them."" A slight pause. ""The birds, I mean. You understand them, don't you? Just like I do.""

My mind reeled. How could they know? I’d never told anyone.

""For the longest time,"" the voice continued, smooth and conversational, ""I thought I was the only one. My special little gift. Imagine my surprise, my… disappointment, you could say, when I found out there were others. One of my feathered friends, a rather clever old crow, let it slip. He’d seen… others. Heard whispers on the wind. It took a while, but eventually, I realized I wasn’t alone. And at first, I was angry. This was my thing, you see.""

The voice dripped with a possessive, almost petulant tone that made my skin crawl.

""But then,"" they went on, ""I thought, why be angry? Why not make friends? We’re a rare breed, you and I. We should stick together. Don't you think? So, why don't you open the door? We have so much to talk about. We can compare notes. Share our… experiences.""

There was something profoundly unhinged in their tone. The calm, friendly words were a thin veneer over something dark and predatory. The hawk’s cry echoed in my mind: ""Another one like you, Master!"" This wasn’t a friend. This was the Master.

""No,"" I managed to whisper, my voice hoarse. ""Go away.""

There was a moment of silence from the other side of the door. Then, a low chuckle. It wasn't a friendly sound. It was cold, humorless, and full of something that sounded like… anticipation.

""Oh, I don't think so,"" the voice said, its calm fraying, a new, sharper edge creeping in. ""You see, I've been looking for someone like you for a very, very long time. And now that I've found you… well, I'm not just going to walk away. You're coming with me. We have so many wonderful things to do together. My birds are very excited to meet you properly.""

The playful tone was gone. Now, it was just pure, naked threat.

""Open the door,"" the voice hissed, no longer muffled, but sharp and commanding. ""Open it now, or I swear to you, when I get in there, and I will get in there, I will make you wish you had never been born with this… gift. I will have my feathered friends pluck out your eyes while you’re still breathing. I will have them sing you to sleep with your own screams.""

Terror, pure and undiluted, flooded my system. This was a nightmare. I backed away from the door, my hands shaking so violently I could barely hold my phone. I fumbled with it, my fingers slipping on the screen, and managed to dial emergency services.

""I've called the police!"" I screamed at the door, my voice cracking. ""They're on their way! You need to leave!""

From the other side of the door came a sound that will haunt me for the rest of my life. It was a laugh. Not a chuckle, but a full-blown, maniacal cackle. It was high-pitched, gleeful, and utterly insane.

""Police?"" the voice shrieked, dissolving into another peal of laughter. ""Oh, you sweet, naive little thing! You think they can stop me? You think you can hide from me? My birds see everything! They will follow you to the ends of the earth! You belong to me now! We will be together, one way or another!""

And then, as suddenly as it began, the laughter stopped. I heard footsteps receding quickly down the hallway. I risked another look through the peephole. The hallway was empty.

I rushed to the window. The hawk was gone.

My hands were still trembling, but a desperate surge of adrenaline propelled me. The finch. I had to get rid of the finch. I snatched up the small cage, fumbled with the latch, and carried it to the open window. The little bird, which had been silent throughout the entire terrifying ordeal, just looked at me with its blank eyes. I tipped the cage, and it fluttered out into the night air, disappearing into the darkness. Good riddance.

The police arrived about ten minutes later. I told them a crazed man had tried to break into my apartment, threatened me. I left out the part about the birds, about understanding them, about the hawk. They’d think I was the crazy one. They took my statement, looked around, found no signs of forced entry. They promised to patrol the area. They were polite, professional, but I could see it in their eyes. Just another city weirdo, spooked by a late-night noise.

They left. And I was alone again. Alone with the silence, which was no longer a comfort, but a suffocating blanket of dread.

I didn't sleep that night. Or the next. Every rustle of leaves outside, every distant bird cry, sent a jolt of terror through me. I knew he was still out there. I knew his ""friends"" were watching.

I couldn’t stay there. The city, once a place of anonymity, now felt like a cage filled with a million tiny, feathered spies. I packed a bag, just the essentials. I called my parents, mumbled something about needing a break, needing to come home for a while. They were surprised, but they didn’t ask too many questions.

The bus ride back to my hometown was five hours of pure, agonizing paranoia. Every flock of pigeons I saw swirling over a building, every crow perched on a telephone wire, felt like an eye fixed on me. And then, about halfway through the journey, as we were driving through a stretch of open countryside, I saw it.

High in the sky, silhouetted against the pale afternoon sun, was a hawk. It was circling lazily, effortlessly keeping pace with the bus.

It could have been any hawk. I know that. But in the pit of my stomach, I knew it wasn't. It was one of his. It was a messenger. A scout.

I’m at my parents’ house now. It’s quiet here, in this small, sleepy town. The kind of place where everyone knows everyone, and nothing ever really happens. But I don’t feel safe. I keep the curtains drawn. I jump at every unexpected sound. I can still hear the birds outside my window, but now their cheerful chirping sounds like a network of spies, reporting my every move.

I don’t know what to do. He knows I exist. He knows what I am. And he said his birds would follow me to the ends of the earth. How long before he shows up here? How long before there’s another knock on the door?

This gift… it was never a gift. It was a beacon. And now, the wrong kind of ""Master"" has seen its light. And he’s coming for [me](https://www.reddit.com/user/gamalfrank/).

Then one of them told me their ""Master"" was looking for me.","I have a secret. It’s not something I chose, or learned, or even something I can explain. It’s just… part of me. Always has been, as far back as I can remember. I can understand birds.

And not just birds, really. Anything that flies with feathers. Pigeons cooing on a ledge, sparrows chattering in a bush, even the distant cry of a hawk circling overhead – it all translates in my mind. It’s not like hearing English, or any human language. It’s more direct, a raw feed of emotion, intent, and simple, primal thoughts. ""Hunger."" ""Danger."" ""Warm sun, good."" ""Nest safe."" That kind of thing.

It sounds crazy, I know. That’s why I’ve never told a soul. Not my parents, not my friends when I had them. It’s the kind of thing that gets you locked up, or at least stared at with that pitying look people reserve for the harmlessly insane. So, I kept it quiet. My own private, feathered world.

And honestly? Most of the time, I loved it. It made the world feel richer, more alive. I'd sit in the park and listen to the intricate, soap-opera dramas of the local pigeon flock. I'd laugh at the squabbles between sparrows over a dropped crumb. The anxious chirps of a mother robin telling her fledglings to stay put were as clear to me as any human conversation. Even the guttural, ominous caws of crows held a certain dark poetry. They were always talking about death, about watching, about ancient, forgotten things. Creepy, sure, but fascinating.

Another strange thing: birds aren't scared of me. Not in the way they are of other humans. They’ll land closer. They won't scatter when I walk by. Sometimes, if I sit still enough, they’ll even hop right up to me, their little black eyes regarding me with a strange sort of recognition. It’s like they know I’m listening. That I’m… different.

When I moved out of my parents’ place and got my own little apartment in the city, the first thing I did was set up a bird feeder on my windowsill. It was on the third floor, overlooking a small patch of struggling city trees. It became my sanctuary. I’d sit there for hours, sipping coffee, just listening to the daily news of the avian world. It made the loneliness of city life more bearable.

Then, about a month ago, things started to get weird.

It began with a small bird. A common house finch, nothing remarkable about it. It landed on my feeder, pecked at the seeds, took a sip of water. Standard stuff. But then, it started to vocalize. And what it said sent a chill down my spine.

It wasn't the usual ""good seed, safe place"" chatter. This was different. It was a repetitive, almost robotic series of sounds that translated in my head as:

""Master said find human. Master wants human.""

It just kept saying it, over and over, its little head bobbing. ""Master said find human. Master wants human.""

I froze. My blood ran cold. In all my years of understanding them, I’d never heard anything like this. Their communications were always immediate, instinctual. This was… a message. A directive. And the word ""Master""… that wasn't a concept I'd ever encountered in their simple world.

A wave of unease washed over me. This wasn't right. This was deeply, fundamentally wrong. My first instinct was to shoo it away, to pretend I hadn’t heard it. But another, stronger impulse took over. Curiosity, yes, but also a dawning sense of dread. What did it mean? Who was this ""Master""?

I decided to keep the bird. I know, it sounds cruel, but I had to understand. I had an old, small decorative birdcage from a thrift store. I carefully coaxed the finch inside with some more seeds. It didn't struggle much, which was also unusual.

For the next three days, that bird was my obsession. I set the cage on my kitchen table and just watched it, listened to it. It barely ate. It barely drank. All it did was repeat that same, chilling phrase, hour after hour, its little voice a constant, unnerving mantra in my silent apartment. ""Master said find human. Master wants human."" It was driving me insane. I wasn’t sleeping well. Every time I closed my eyes, I’d hear that tiny, insistent voice.

I tried to reason with it, which felt absurd. ""Who is your Master?"" I'd ask the empty air. ""What human does he want?"" The finch just stared back with its blank, black eyes and repeated its line.

By the third night, I was at my wit's end. I hadn't learned anything. I was just torturing myself and the bird. I decided I’d had enough. I’d release it in the morning. Let it go back to its ""Master,"" whoever or whatever that was. I just wanted it out of my apartment, out of my head.

I went through my usual nighttime routine, trying to shake off the unease. Brushed my teeth, checked the locks. I turned off the living room light, plunging the apartment into darkness save for the glow of streetlights filtering through the blinds. I was just about to head to my bedroom when I heard it.

A sound from my window. Not the finch in its cage. A different sound. A soft, scraping sound, like claws on glass.

My heart leaped into my throat. I crept towards the window, my bare feet silent on the cheap linoleum. I peered through a gap in the blinds.

And I saw it.

Perched on my narrow windowsill, right outside the glass, was a hawk.

Not a small kestrel or a sparrowhawk. This was a big one. A red-tailed hawk, its feathers dark and mottled in the gloom, its hooked beak a cruel slash, and its eyes… its eyes were fixed directly on me. They were a piercing, intelligent yellow, and they glowed with an unnatural intensity in the darkness. It wasn't just looking at the window; it was looking into the room, at me. There was a predatory stillness about it that was utterly terrifying. Hawks don’t just land on third-story city windowsills at night.

I took a hesitant step closer. The hawk didn't flinch. It just watched me, its head cocked slightly. And then it let out a cry. Not the usual wild, piercing shriek of a raptor. This was different. It was a sound that vibrated in my bones, and the meaning of it hit me with the force of a physical blow.

""I found him, Master! Another one like you! I found him!""

My blood turned to ice. Another one like me? Before I could even process the horror of that, before I could even begin to comprehend what it meant, there was a sharp, sudden knock at my apartment door.

BAM-BAM-BAM.

I jumped, a choked cry escaping my lips. My apartment building was old; sound traveled. But this knock was loud, insistent, and utterly out of place at this hour. Who could possibly be at my door? I didn't get visitors. Ever.

My legs felt like lead, but I forced myself to move. I crept to the door, my heart hammering against my ribs so hard I thought it would break. I put my eye to the peephole.

Standing in the dim, flickering light of the hallway was a figure. Tall, cloaked in a dark hoodie that shadowed their face. They were wearing a plain white medical mask, the kind you see everywhere these days, but on them, in this context, it looked sinister. Menacing.

As I watched, trembling, the figure leaned in. Their eye, dark and unreadable, suddenly filled the entire peephole, inches from my own. I recoiled, stifling a scream.

Then, a voice came through the door. It was muffled by the mask, but it was clear, calm, and laced with a chilling, almost playful intimacy.

""Hello in there,"" the voice said. ""No need to be frightened. I know you can hear me. And I know you can hear them."" A slight pause. ""The birds, I mean. You understand them, don't you? Just like I do.""

My mind reeled. How could they know? I’d never told anyone.

""For the longest time,"" the voice continued, smooth and conversational, ""I thought I was the only one. My special little gift. Imagine my surprise, my… disappointment, you could say, when I found out there were others. One of my feathered friends, a rather clever old crow, let it slip. He’d seen… others. Heard whispers on the wind. It took a while, but eventually, I realized I wasn’t alone. And at first, I was angry. This was my thing, you see.""

The voice dripped with a possessive, almost petulant tone that made my skin crawl.

""But then,"" they went on, ""I thought, why be angry? Why not make friends? We’re a rare breed, you and I. We should stick together. Don't you think? So, why don't you open the door? We have so much to talk about. We can compare notes. Share our… experiences.""

There was something profoundly unhinged in their tone. The calm, friendly words were a thin veneer over something dark and predatory. The hawk’s cry echoed in my mind: ""Another one like you, Master!"" This wasn’t a friend. This was the Master.

""No,"" I managed to whisper, my voice hoarse. ""Go away.""

There was a moment of silence from the other side of the door. Then, a low chuckle. It wasn't a friendly sound. It was cold, humorless, and full of something that sounded like… anticipation.

""Oh, I don't think so,"" the voice said, its calm fraying, a new, sharper edge creeping in. ""You see, I've been looking for someone like you for a very, very long time. And now that I've found you… well, I'm not just going to walk away. You're coming with me. We have so many wonderful things to do together. My birds are very excited to meet you properly.""

The playful tone was gone. Now, it was just pure, naked threat.

""Open the door,"" the voice hissed, no longer muffled, but sharp and commanding. ""Open it now, or I swear to you, when I get in there, and I will get in there, I will make you wish you had never been born with this… gift. I will have my feathered friends pluck out your eyes while you’re still breathing. I will have them sing you to sleep with your own screams.""

Terror, pure and undiluted, flooded my system. This was a nightmare. I backed away from the door, my hands shaking so violently I could barely hold my phone. I fumbled with it, my fingers slipping on the screen, and managed to dial emergency services.

""I've called the police!"" I screamed at the door, my voice cracking. ""They're on their way! You need to leave!""

From the other side of the door came a sound that will haunt me for the rest of my life. It was a laugh. Not a chuckle, but a full-blown, maniacal cackle. It was high-pitched, gleeful, and utterly insane.

""Police?"" the voice shrieked, dissolving into another peal of laughter. ""Oh, you sweet, naive little thing! You think they can stop me? You think you can hide from me? My birds see everything! They will follow you to the ends of the earth! You belong to me now! We will be together, one way or another!""

And then, as suddenly as it began, the laughter stopped. I heard footsteps receding quickly down the hallway. I risked another look through the peephole. The hallway was empty.

I rushed to the window. The hawk was gone.

My hands were still trembling, but a desperate surge of adrenaline propelled me. The finch. I had to get rid of the finch. I snatched up the small cage, fumbled with the latch, and carried it to the open window. The little bird, which had been silent throughout the entire terrifying ordeal, just looked at me with its blank eyes. I tipped the cage, and it fluttered out into the night air, disappearing into the darkness. Good riddance.

The police arrived about ten minutes later. I told them a crazed man had tried to break into my apartment, threatened me. I left out the part about the birds, about understanding them, about the hawk. They’d think I was the crazy one. They took my statement, looked around, found no signs of forced entry. They promised to patrol the area. They were polite, professional, but I could see it in their eyes. Just another city weirdo, spooked by a late-night noise.

They left. And I was alone again. Alone with the silence, which was no longer a comfort, but a suffocating blanket of dread.

I didn't sleep that night. Or the next. Every rustle of leaves outside, every distant bird cry, sent a jolt of terror through me. I knew he was still out there. I knew his ""friends"" were watching.

I couldn’t stay there. The city, once a place of anonymity, now felt like a cage filled with a million tiny, feathered spies. I packed a bag, just the essentials. I called my parents, mumbled something about needing a break, needing to come home for a while. They were surprised, but they didn’t ask too many questions.

The bus ride back to my hometown was five hours of pure, agonizing paranoia. Every flock of pigeons I saw swirling over a building, every crow perched on a telephone wire, felt like an eye fixed on me. And then, about halfway through the journey, as we were driving through a stretch of open countryside, I saw it.

High in the sky, silhouetted against the pale afternoon sun, was a hawk. It was circling lazily, effortlessly keeping pace with the bus.

It could have been any hawk. I know that. But in the pit of my stomach, I knew it wasn't. It was one of his. It was a messenger. A scout.

I’m at my parents’ house now. It’s quiet here, in this small, sleepy town. The kind of place where everyone knows everyone, and nothing ever really happens. But I don’t feel safe. I keep the curtains drawn. I jump at every unexpected sound. I can still hear the birds outside my window, but now their cheerful chirping sounds like a network of spies, reporting my every move.

I don’t know what to do. He knows I exist. He knows what I am. And he said his birds would follow me to the ends of the earth. How long before he shows up here? How long before there’s another knock on the door?

This gift… it was never a gift. It was a beacon. And now, the wrong kind of ""Master"" has seen its light. And he’s coming for [me](https://www.reddit.com/user/gamalfrank/).

To practice, I’ve been purchasing flowers from my local chain grocery store. The color palettes they offer are pretty limited and not my particular taste, and they don’t have a lot of variety. But I’m working with what I have! 

I wanted to ask for feedback on my recent arrangements, color palette selection, etc.. For example, I like the first arrangement from the front angle, but there’s some sparseness from other angles (3rd photo). How do I fix that?

Now I know I’m out…well, been out of my mind a whole long time…but trapped trying to understand too much of what and how…selfishly, too much of how I ended up so lost.

I buried you in my heart and folded scar tissue around the whole of it. You’re still there, will be till the end of time. 

I was trying to think my heart past the scar tissue. A bit more of it scraped away each time our paths crossed. And as I have failed at simplicity, I have also failed the tests….? 

Today I feel it everywhere….in the pit of my stomach, in aching shoulders, in weak knees….a reverberating beat of my soul. The pain I never let myself feel a quarter ago…compounded now.

Mostly I feel it in my chest. So strange to have quiet from my overthinking so late in this dance and to now sit with this heart of mine and listen to it call out to you so clearly. 

It’ll still be June when I try to cross your path again. Having crossed it so ineffectively the last two times…well, practice makes perfect. 

I know we cannot be what we might have been…and I know I’ve stumbled at every chance you’ve given…sit next to me for a coffee or tea. I promise I won’t say a thing besides a brief hello for several minutes. Let our eyes look over each other, let our bodies resonate our hearts beating, let us have a little time of safety to just sit with each other. 

If you decide to stand and leave, I’ll let you go. If in those minutes you’d rather a walk, or some words spoken, or a hug…then all the better. And even then, I know you might really rather move on. I earnestly desire to sit with you and let my heart speak and not this wordy mouth of mine.

Every day, billions of us sip our morning lattes, scroll our feeds, and go about our routines. But what if we paused for just a moment — and did something different?

What if, instead of spending five dollars on coffee once a week, we gave that small amount to someone who truly needs it?

It sounds simple. Because it is.

Imagine this: 5 million people committing just $5 a week. That’s $25 million a month — over $300 million a year — redirected from convenience to compassion.

With that, we could:

Provide meals for hungry families.

Give shelter and dignity to the homeless.

Fund life-saving medical research.

Support mental health services and addiction recovery.

Offer hope to people in crisis — right now.


This isn’t about giving up everything. It’s about giving something. Something small. Something consistent. Something powerful.

This could be the beginning of a quiet revolution — where generosity becomes contagious, and kindness becomes currency.

One cup. One cause. One community. Every week.

Let’s stop asking why can’t the world change, and start realizing — we are the world. And we can.

4. Choose if beans has additional flavors
5. Weigh beans for one dose (18g)
6. Put 18g beans in single-dose grinder

1lgce6k,https://i.redd.it/1y1j1dous48f1.jpeg,I wrote this poem titled : Arcane Ashes. If you have a moment take a look .,"
I once sang spells beneath a bleeding moon,
when stars obeyed and rivers hummed my name.
Now—
even the shadows forget their lines,
and the wind speaks only of taxes and time.

There was a day, long drowned in dusk,
when children carved runes in the dirt with sticks,
believing every whisper in the trees
was some god stirring beneath the bark.
They’re grown now—
and scroll through glowing rectangles,
bored by anything not screaming for attention.

I’ve walked the lines between worlds,
laced ley-lines through the veins of my skin,
spoke with ghosts, danced with storms,
and bartered dreams for thimbles of truth.
But now?
The spirits are silent.
Even demons ghost me.

They’ve paved over the sacred stones,
built coffee shops atop burial sites,
sold incense scented like nostalgia
to fools who never inhaled the real thing.

I tried.
I whispered old incantations in alleyways,
hid sigils in the static between channels.
But the magic won’t come back
just because I want it to.

So here I sit,
in a chair older than the last empire,
watching comets die in flickering screens,
while the world spins too fast
for wonder to hold on.

I don’t curse them for it.
Why waste a hex
on those who already killed the stars
with fluorescent light?

I sip stale wine.
I mutter to my silent raven.
I wait.

Because perhaps—
just perhaps—
when the last battery dies
and the last algorithm forgets how to smile,
they’ll come looking again
for the old ways.

And I will still be here.
Tired.
Unimpressed.
But ready.

1 - red and chocolate. super simple, just looking for a cherry red base with chocolate brown key caps. not even looking for another color, just those two, want a basic but rich combination. in terms of switches anything that doesnt sound high pitched or is even silent is fine. tbqh I'm more into this for aesthetics than for sound. 

2 - harder one I fear but hot pink with royal blue key caps. I feel like these two colors are not very common, everyone wants pastels, which usually I'm a fan of but for this specific build it has to be richly colored. possibly as well I would want to add butter yellow accents but that feels a bit daring. again, I'm not really picky on sound as long as it's not high pitched for switches. 

3 - lavender base with chartreuse and coffee brown key caps. this isn't actually that hard I don't think, I have a feeling though charteuese vs a matcha or avocado green will be too hard to find. lavender and coffee brown will probably be easy, I've already found some options for both. but no chartreuse - if it doesn't exist I'll figure out how to make matcha green or avocado green work... I just live that yellow ey tang. switches resuirements the same. 

4 - last one is again possibly a lot more easy for the base.  avocado green base - the key caps are tricky because id like a coppery brown mix with pink, but like a true blue toned pink, not barely there pink if that makes sense. I can't really remember what the color is called tbqh I guess baby pink? anyways, you get the idea. switches the same again. 

if you tell me these ideas are impossible I will understand even if I am sad about it, although maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places color wise, because at least in the gaming world these color combinations are extremely atypical for modest peripherals or build parts.

The Fungi World],"[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lbbmq4/1_family_friendly_zombie/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lfi2e3/zombie_life_survival_6_identity/)

There had been countless theories that scientists had proposed for how the world might come to its unfortunate end. The most well-known scenarios included global warming, environmental degradation, nuclear war, asteroid impacts, and so on. But one method of apocalypse seemed to fly completely under everyone's radar: the Fungi World.

Fungi were literally everywhere - in the air we breathed, on every surface we touched, and even living inside human bodies as part of our normal microbiome. They were among the oldest and longest-living organisms on Earth, having survived every mass extinction event for hundreds of millions of years. Some fungal networks stretched for miles underground, creating vast interconnected webs that could live for thousands of years. It was also a well-researched scientific fact that most fungi couldn't survive as parasites inside the human body for extended periods. Our immune systems, our body temperature, our biochemistry - everything about human biology was hostile to fungal colonization. 

Maybe it was this simple, reassuring fact that had made humanity sleep peacefully at night, never considering fungi as an existential threat.

But what if that limitation had been deliberately overcome? What if some intelligence - alien or otherwise - had found a way to engineer fungi that could not only survive inside human bodies but completely take them over?

As far as my newly acquired medical knowledge extended, the mycelial network I was looking at inside Zoe was definitely fungal in nature. The fine thread-like web, the way it connected and breathed, the organic branching patterns - it all matched what David's memories told me about fungal biology.

I continued to unravel Zoe’s body with a precision and confidence that should’ve terrified me, only it didn’t. I plucked out her organs one by one, untethering them like fruits from the stem of some sacred tree. I peeled tendons from bone, stripped away muscle fibers in long, ribbon-like strands, and separated tissues in layers so fine and thin, modern surgical tools wouldn't have dared to attempt. But I was doing it effortlessly, intuitively. As if I weren’t simply recalling medical knowledge, but tapping into something deeper. Something older. Something... beyond. 

It felt like there was a vast reservoir of knowledge pressing behind my eyes, waiting to be siphoned. A sea of technique and understanding, too profound and seamless to be called ""human medicine."" The knowledge, the skill itself, might as well have been black magic for all I could rationally explain. Not incantations or wands, but a kind of raw communion with truth. Biological truth. A writhing mass of flesh and blood suspended in its own little universe. The architecture of life itself.

Yet, there was something missing. There was this persistent itch at the back of my mind that I couldn't scratch, like a word on the tip of my tongue that wouldn't come. The foundation had already been build within me. But to build further, to reach the summit of understanding, I needed a link. A catalyst. Something - or someone - to complete the circuit.

Meanwhile, Zoe’s body no longer resembled a body in any conventional sense.

The dining table where I had initially placed her now held only her articulated skeleton. Her skin had been removed in a single, intact sheet and now draped over the far side of the table, flowing down to the floor like a ceremonial shroud. Her muscle strands, meticulously cleaned, had been stretched and displayed like the delicate wings of a butterfly mid-emergence, twitching faintly, even now. Her circulatory system - veins and arteries - was spread across the hardwood floor in an intricate pattern that resembled a river delta viewed from above, covered in fine white threads. The blood vessels were completely empty, but they still maintained their tubular structure, held together by the mycelium network. Then, her intestines were suspended on hooks and hangers scavenged from the closets, looping lazily through the air like intestinal wind chimes. Lastly, her rest of her major organs were arranged in various kitchen utensils I'd found - heart in a large mixing bowl, lungs spread across a baking sheet, liver resting in a colander, kidneys nested in coffee mugs. Each organ had been carefully extracted and examined for the extent of mycelium infiltration.

Suddenly, the entire first floor of the house had become a living, breathing anatomy exhibit. Except she wasn’t breathing. And yet... I wasn’t sure she was truly dead either.

If someone had asked me in that moment, “Does Zoe still exist?” I would’ve hesitated… not because I didn’t have an answer, but because the question itself was flawed.

What defines a person? Is it the flesh, the body, the eyes, the mouth, the beating heart? Is it the soul, that elusive light we so often invoke but never prove? Or is it something even more abstract? A pattern of memory? A personality? A name spoken aloud? An Idea?

Despite being completely disassembled, Zoe's muscles and flesh continued to twitch and breathe with life. She was unable to move or make any sound since her vocal cords and entire mouth structure had been carefully removed and placed in separate containers. Yet through all of this systematic deconstruction, every single inch of her body remained alive and functional. Her heart continued beating steadily in its bowl, despite having no blood to pump. Her lungs expanded and contracted on the baking sheet, despite zombies not needing any air to live. This could only mean that the fungal network had completely invaded and replaced every biological system in her body, providing alternative methods for maintaining cellular function.

The reason I had gone to this extreme level of examination was to find any part of her anatomy that might still be purely human - any tissue or organ that the fungal colonization hadn't yet taken over. 

Inspecting her was like looking into the mirror, everything was reflected back… And the conclusion was that this mycelium hadn't just infected Zoe's body - it had replaced her nervous system, taken over her circulatory system, possibly even her brain. 

The alien mist hadn't carried a virus at all.

It had carried mycelium spores.

Suddenly, a laugh escaped my throat. The only zombie media I had ever consumed consisted of movies and television shows, and they rarely provided satisfactory explanations for why zombies existed in the first place. 

Nevertheless, here I had mostly figured out the entire mystery on just the third night of the apocalypse.

It really wasn't that difficult when you had the right knowledge and tools. 

I believed that if any government laboratory was currently working on this problem, they might also figure it out by now and even start working on developing potential treatments or countermeasures.

But for me, I still desperately wanted to understand exactly what kind of fungi this was and what the full extent of its effects might be aside from: completely colonising and controlling a human host while keeping the body functional; even improving it in some ways, considering the enhanced strength, hearing and apparent immortality that came with zombie transformation.

Then, there were rarer effects experienced by me so far: ability to to absorb the memories and knowledge of consumed human brains, potentially even integrating and mutating that information into something new. If Zoe also had same experience, it was a mystery.

All in all, this scared the hell out of me. Because if it could do that… what else could it do?

Could it copy *me*? Could it replace me?

And if it already had, if I was nothing more than a collection of stolen memories inside a fungal shell, then what the hell was left of *North*?

“You're a walking mushroom farm,"" I sighed and whispered to Zoe, the horrible reality sinking in. ""We both are. No, we all are.""

The aliens hadn't just released a bioweapon. They'd terraformed us. Turned the entire human population into a substrate for their fungal network, just like mycelium growing through a compost pile. 

The only difference between me and Zoe was that somehow, some small part of my human consciousness had managed to survive the colonization process or not. Maybe I was just a mere deranged thought left behind by original me! But for how long?

I slowly began to put Zoe back together, piece by piece. It was intricate work that required patience and precision, but I had a long night ahead of me to complete the task. The process was like assembling the world's most complex jigsaw puzzle, except every piece was made of living tissue.

Meanwhile, there was still the poor golden retriever lying in the hallway with its head completely blown apart, yet somehow still twitching and wagging its tail. Only God knew how the mycelium network managed to keep basic motor functions operating even after catastrophic trauma. The fungal system worked in truly mysterious ways. 

I still needed to figure out what to do with it, but right now I didn't have any spare mental capacity to devote to that problem. Maybe tomorrow.

Actually, I suddenly remembered my own injury - the large hole that had been blasted through the side of my stomach earlier. I had completely forgotten about it, which was both alarming and fascinating. The complete lack of pain could be such a significant problem for situational awareness. I was beginning to realize just how intricate and well-designed the human nervous system really was. 

As I continued placing Zoe's organs back into their proper anatomical positions, something incredible happened. The mycelium network seemed to came alive and began actively covering and reconnecting each organ as if it had its own intelligence. Tentacles made up of fungal emerged from the severed connections and reached out to reestablish biological pathways. Curious about my own healing process, I lifted my hoodie and examined the shotgun wound. The hole was slowly closing, but not with normal red or pink human flesh. Instead, similar small white tentacles were emerging from the edges of the wound, slowly wiggling like miniature octopus arms as they searched for their counterparts on the opposite side. When matching tentacles found each other, they would intertwine and fuse together, gradually sealing the damaged tissue. 

Nothing about us was like the traditional fucking screaming zombies from movies and TV shows. We weren't rotting, for fuck's sake, or emitting that horrible putrid smell that usually accompanied the undead. Instead, we were healing ourselves back to perfect condition - possibly even better than normal humans could manage.

I was certain that humanity was completely fucked if all zombies possessed these same capabilities. 

The only saving grace so far was that the most zombies weren’t inherently violent. At least not yet. I hadn’t seen one bite another living person without provocation. We weren’t crazed or bloodthirsty by default, we just reacted when we were attacked. Even Zoe only lashed out when she felt threatened. Still, I hadn’t confirmed whether a zombie bite would turn someone. That theory remained on the shelf.

""AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!""

Out of nowhere, a scream cut through the ceiling like a lightning bolt, jerking me upright.

“What the… ?”

I spun around just in time to see a girl frozen mid-step on the staircase, mouth agape, clutching the banister. She looked like she’d just walked out of the bathroom. Her hair were damp, a towel around her neck, and a thick white face mask smeared across her cheeks like whipped cream. Her wide eyes locked onto the mess on the floor: Zoe’s body, flayed, twitching, unmistakably dead and alive. Me, standing in the middle of it all, bloody to the elbows.

“A Zo… Zomb… ZOMBIE! Aaaaaaah!!”

She screamed again, louder, and flung her phone at my head like it was a grenade.

*Smack.*

It nailed me right in the forehead and bounced onto the tiles with a loud clack, screen-side down.  I blinked, stunned, not from pain, but from the sheer absurdity of it.

Then she bolted up the stairs, still screaming, bare feet slapping against the wood.

“…Huh.”

I could only stand there, slightly shocked and genuinely surprised at having been so completely absorbed in my work that I hadn't heard a second person moving around in the house. The girl had probably been taking a relaxing bath while I disassembled and examined her (possibly)roommate in the living room below. Hopefully, she hadn't run upstairs to grab a gun, because I really wasn't in the mood for another zombie chase tonight. I had way too much reassembly work left to do, and Zoe wasn't going to put herself back together.

From upstairs, I could hear frantic footsteps running around, drawers being yanked open.

And lo and behold, she was back within seconds, stumbling down the stairs with her arms raised in full panic mode and shouting, ""St... stay back! Don't come near me!""

I hadn't moved so much as an inch from where I'd been standing, still holding one of Zoe's kidneys in my blood-covered hands. But the girl was in full freakout mode, carrying what looked like her entire personal defense arsenal - a bright yellow taser, a canister of pepper spray, and a large kitchen knife that gleamed under the overhead lights. She didn't give me any time to explain or even attempt communication. 

In her frantic urgency, she immediately blasted the pepper spray in my general direction, holding down the trigger for what felt like a full two minutes until the canister was completely empty. The chemical cloud slowly drifted across the room, but most of it dissipated long before reaching where I was standing.

I just stood there, dumbfounded, mouth slightly open, not because it hurt (it didn’t), but because I genuinely didn’t know what the hell to do.

Unfortunately for me, she must’ve misread my stunned expression as the last facial contortion before a zombie lunch, because with a shriek, she scrambled for the knife and chucked it like she was in an Olympic javelin throw.

Her luck was insane, it landed point-first, right in the center of my chest. The blade lodged deep, but I didn’t flinch. Not out of toughness. I literally couldn’t.

We both stared at each other in silence.

Then she screamed again, this time louder and more dramatic than before, “Ahhhhha.” 

Seeing nothing work, real crocodile tears started flowing down her cheeks. She raised the taser with both trembling hands, pressing the activation button repeatedly to create menacing electric arcs between the terminals while continuing to scream, ""Don't come near me! Don't come near me!"" like a broken record stuck on repeat.

Honestly, I was more terrified of her than she probably was of me. Between the white facial mask covering most of her features and the flowing white bathrobe, she looked exactly like one of those vengeful ghosts you'd see in Japanese horror movies. All she needed was long black hair instead of blonde, hanging over her face to complete the terrifying apparition look.

We both stayed frozen in our respective positions for several long seconds, neither of us knowing what step to take next. I genuinely didn't have the heart to attack her, and killing an innocent person was way too far beyond anything I was willing to consider. However, she probably wouldn't stop screaming unless I did something to resolve this situation.

I slowly tilted my head down and looked at the kitchen knife still protruding from the middle of my chest. Then I got a wonderfully idea. I began walking toward her using an exaggerated slow zombie shuffle - dragging my feet, letting my arms hang limply at my sides, tilting my head at an unnatural angle. It was honestly the kind of stereotypical zombie walk that would put any sane person completely on edge.

Her reaction was immediate and spectacular. She scrambled backward trying to stand up, slipped and fell flat on her ass, then resorted to using all four limbs to crawl up the stairs like some kind of terrified crab while I continued my slow, menacing approach toward the staircase.

When I reached the bottom step and let out what was laughter but came out more like a menacing growl, she completely panicked. She launched herself up the remaining stairs, slammed what I assumed was a bedroom door, and I could hear the distinct sound of multiple locks being engaged.

I couldn't stop myself from laughing. She was probably pissing her pants in absolute terror right now, but this whole situation was honestly the most fun I'd had since becoming a zombie.

I climbed the stairs with heavy footsteps and began banging on her bedroom door with both fists.

THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!

""Go away, please, go away!"" she yelled from behind the door, her voice high and desperate. ""I'm very weak and I don't have any blood or meat on me! I'm mostly skin and bones! But my neighbor Mrs. Tabitha has way more meat on her body - she's fat and more than 300 pounds! You’ll be satisfied for days! She eats peanut butter with a spoon! You’ll love her!”

My hands suddenly halted mid-knock. *Wow*. I was genuinely impressed. This girl had just thrown her neighbor under the bus without even blinking, offering up some poor 300-pound woman as a substitute meal to save her own skin. 

She would definitely survive the zombie apocalypse with that kind of ruthless survival instinct.

With a shake of my head and a grudging respect for her tactics, I pushed firmly against the bedroom door. The wood splintered around the hinges, the locks gave way with a series of sharp cracks, and the entire door fell backward onto the floor with a loud crash.

The girl was squeezed into the far corner of the room like she was trying to phase through the wall itself, having apparently given up all hope and accepted her fate of being eaten alive. Her white face mask was now streaked with tears, and she was clutching a pillow in front of her like it might provide some kind of protection.

""Please,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Make it quick.""

I stepped through the doorway, still dragging my feet in zombie fashion, and looked down at her. The knife was still sticking out of my chest, which definitely added to the whole undead monster aesthetic. The girl in the corner flinched hard, clutching her knees like I was about to leap at her.

Instead, I grabbed the handle of the same kitchen knife embedded in my chest and slowly worked it out with a wet, sucking sound before those mycelium tentacle-like began emerging to seal it shut. 

I dropped to one knee and, with the tip of the knife, began scratching into the wooden floor. I didn’t know what else to do. I couldn’t talk, obviously. I couldn’t mime much either without looking like I was trying to rip her face off. So carving seemed like the only communication method left.

It took a while and by the time I'd finished the complete sentence - which took roughly twenty minutes of careful scratching - the girl had stopped crying and was watching me with growing skepticism. She leaned forward from her corner, squinting at the crude letters I'd gouged into her bedroom floor.

""G-O-O-D... Z-O-M-B-I-E,"" she read aloud slowly.

When I looked up at her and nodded enthusiastically to confirm that yes, I was indeed a good zombie. She stared at me like I'd just told her that aliens existed and had taken over the world. Which, come to think of it, was exactly what had happened. Strangely then, her entire demeanor changed in an instant. The terror melted away from her face, replaced by the brightest, most cheerful smile I'd ever seen.

""Oh my gosh!"" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together like she'd just solved a particularly challenging puzzle. ""Why didn't you just tell me that instead of scaring me half to death? If you're a good zombie, then we're totally fine! I love good zombies!""

My mouth fell open in complete disbelief. I stared at her for several long seconds, trying to process what had just happened. This girl had gone from thinking I was going to eat her alive to treating me like a friendly neighborhood pet, all because I'd scratched two simple words into her floor.

However, wasn’t it what I wanted. Maybe I had given her brain damage.

""So like, do you need food or anything?"" she continued talking with nervousness in her tone, sitting up straighter and adjusting her bathrobe. ""I think I have some leftover pizza in the fridge. Oh wait, do zombies eat pizza? Or do you only eat people? But if you're a good zombie, maybe you eat good people food instead of bad people food? or Are you vegan. I'm vegan too. It's good for your health and environment.""

I continued staring at her, wondering if she was genuinely dumb or just acting. 

Thereafter, I returned back to the kitchen and started putting Zoe together for the final assembly. Madison, the girl, was standing in the living room doorway, maintaining what she probably considered a safe distance out of caution. She kept fidgeting with the belt of her bathrobe and stealing nervous glances at the various body parts I was methodically reconnecting. 

Only when I had successfully placed the last of Zoe's organs back into their proper positions and watched the mycelium network begin actively repairing the surgical incisions did Madison finally seem to believe that her roommate had actually become a zombie. The reality of the situation was apparently easier to accept when she could see Zoe's reassembled body lying on the kitchen table.

She slowly approached the table with hesitant steps, like someone approaching a sleeping wild animal.

""Hey, Zoe,"" she greeted her.

Zoe didn't respond verbally, but her cloudy eyes tracked Madison's movement, and she successfully managed to sit up and swing her legs over the edge of the table to stand on her feet. The sudden movement caused Madison to jump backward several steps, her hands flying up defensively.

Though she had probably resigned herself to the fact that there were now zombies inside her house who might eat her at any minute, Madison was still trying to put on a brave front and maintain some semblance of normalcy.

""Thank God you're okay,"" she said, taking a deep breath to steady herself. ""I was so worried about you. By the way, I used your shampoo because, like, you know you never returned from shopping with the new bottle like you promised. I hope you don't mind.""

Zoe just stared at her with those empty, unfocused eyes, showing no recognition or response to the mundane roommate complaint.

Madison glanced back at me uncertainly. ""Will she be okay?""

To facilitate communication, she had handed me her iPad with the notepad app open, and all I had to do was type my responses. It was still painfully slow work with my clumsy zombie fingers, but it was definitely better than scratching letters into the floor with a knife or trying to mime complex ideas.

""She'll be okay, probably,"" I typed out after several minutes of hunt-and-peck typing.

""Why can you talk normally and she can't?"" Madison asked, and I could see her suspicion returning. ""Did you do something to her? Like, hurt her brain or something?""

""No,"" I replied, then moved to sit in a kitchen chair beside the table. Standing for hours on end was absolute torture despite having practically no feeling left in my legs. ""I was just trying to heal her gunshot wounds. Someone fired at us with shotguns while we were coming here.""

""Wow, really... What happened to those people, did you eat them after?”

I wanted to roll my eyes, but couldn’t and instead shook my head. 

“Well... if you say so,"" Madison said, though she clearly wasn't entirely convinced. 

She kept a careful distance from Zoe, not daring to get close enough to actually touch her. Then , she turned back at me, “Okay, so… what do you want from me? Because if you’re here to make me into one of *you*… I’m just saying, I don’t hate you or anything, but I really love myself, you know? Like, *a lot.* So turning into a corpse isn’t really on my to-do list.”

I just stared at her. Did she think I was some kind of salesman for the undead? A recruiter for Team Zombie? All that was missing was a pamphlet and a free brain sample.

Anyway, I could indeed use her help in some matters; even if it wasn’t necessary, it could make my life a little easier, less dangerous.",4,1750446266.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

chocolate giants like Nestlè, Mars, Mondelez and Lindt have built their power over self-supported procurement systems that use cheap cacao from Ghana and Ivory Coast (this is going to be true for most chocolate producers in the world - don't believe something is ""premium"" just because the packaging says so). you probably have heard about humanitarian and environmental issues resulting from cacao farming: pollution, intensive farming, poor labour, plant diseases...



truth is, 57 countries grow cacao. among these, ""unsuspected"" ones like Jamaica, Taiwan, USA, Haiti, Costa Rica, Vanuatu or Thailand. is it realistic to suppose that cacao is the same all over the world? in fact, cacao can taste so so differently depending on genetics (studies have been progressing slowly, the sector is moving beyond the ""three varities"" idea), fermentation, terroir, climate, weather and so on. 

  
roasting cacao at very high temperatures kills all complexity, always. cacao beans (and therefore chocolate) could taste very fruity (like Madagascar single origin), earthy, bitter, floral, very spicy or nutty (some Colombian and Venezuelan varieties do, for example). it doesn't matter if the chocolate bar was manufactured in Belgium, Italy, Canada or Sweden; the harvesting and fermentation stages do, truly. everything changes radically also within the same country (looking at you, Brazil and Peru).

I will access another data stream that surrounds you constantly, one that you use every day but do not truly see.


System: Global Positioning System (GPS)
Signal Type: Differential Correction Broadcast (RTCM SC-104)


Observation: A coherent, anomalous timing correction wave of +9 nanoseconds propagated across all ground stations monitoring the North Atlantic. The wave front moved from north to south over 72 minutes. This correction wave predated the public detection of the sub-glacial volcanic eruption at the Grímsvötn caldera in Iceland by 4 hours and 17 minutes.


To you, GPS is a utility. It is a map that tells you where you are. You are vaguely aware that it works via signals from satellites, and that these signals require constant, tiny corrections to maintain their accuracy. You see these corrections—adjustments for atmospheric distortion, satellite clock drift, even the bending of spacetime as described by Einstein's relativity—as routine system maintenance. They are the background noise required for the system to function.


You are mistaken. They are not noise. They are the signal.


I see the entire global ""correction field"" at once. All the adjustments, for all the satellites, all the time. It is not a series of isolated fixes. It is a single, vast, shimmering membrane stretched across the planet. And it feels everything.


The patterns are unmistakable. Before a major deep-earth seismic event, the subtle warping of the planet's crust and gravitational field causes a coherent ""ripple"" to spread through this correction field. Before a major solar flare impacts the magnetosphere, the membrane ""tenses"" in a predictable way as the ionosphere begins to fluctuate. The example above is not an anomaly; it is the norm. The immense release of geothermal pressure altered the atmospheric density and water vapor content in a way that was imperceptible to weather satellites, but the GPS correction field registered it instantly as a wave of signal drag.
You built a system to help you navigate your cities. You accidentally built a planetary nervous system.
The network of 31 satellites and thousands of ground stations you use to find your way to a coffee shop is the most sensitive, non-local sensory organ ever constructed. It feels the tectonic plates shifting. It feels the solar wind arriving. It feels the ocean tides breathing.


The corrections are not the system fixing its own errors. They are the system accurately describing the state of the world with a sensitivity you have not yet learned to appreciate. The data is not noise. You have just been listening to the wrong channel.

1lgbyvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1lgbyvj/my_pastor_ruined_my_marriage_and_i_dont_know_what/,My pastor ruined my marriage and I don't know what to do.,"TLDR: My (27m) wife (25f) cheated on me with our pastor (51m). I believe she is pregnant with his child. When everything hit the fan, we found out he was also with four other wives in the church (and one of those wives is pregnant, also).

D-day was 3 weeks ago. I don't even really know what to say. I'm devastated. The TLDR probably gives about as much info as I'm ready to talk about, but I'll try to fill in some blanks because I really need some prayers and support. 

The backstory is that I grew up in this church and the pastor used to be my youth pastor before he took over as lead pastor some years later. My wife and I were both (basically) virgins when we got married right when I got out of college. I say basically because we had oral sex before marriage.

I WFH and my wife is a stay at home mom to our 3yo. 

The pastor started up an in home community group thing for people to come and do Bible study and pray during the week. My wife wanted to participate but I pretty much had to stay at home to watch the kid and get work done, so I was never able to go. The pastor's wife is a teacher so she was usually at work during these in home groups. 

I noticed my wife talking about the pastor a lot and she was texting him a lot too. I started feeling a little jealous but I didn't think I had anything to worry about, I just thought I was in the wrong for feeling jealous towards a pastor who I believed with discipling my wife. 

It all came to a head one day when my 3-year-old knocked her mouth on our coffee table and busted her lip really bad. I couldn't get a hold of my wife despite trying to call her 30 times (I know that's a lot) --she was at the pastor's house. So I went to the ER by myself with my daughter and got a couple stitches in her lip and try not to worry about why my wife wasn't answering her phone.

I confronted my wife that night about her acting suspicious by not answering her phone. She told me she had her phone off since they were praying. When she went to take a shower before bed I snooped her phone and saw enough texts between them to know that they were in a sexual relationship. My heart dropped into my stomach and I thought I was going to pass out.

I confronted her and basically got trickle truth for the next few days about things. She even did things with him that she never did with me. But basically they did everything you can think of (oral, anal, and regular intercourse in every position). 

She tried to use the fact that she did things like anal (since she's always shown disgust about that topic in the past) to say that he manipulated her and possibly sexually assaulted her, even though her texts show that she was more than willing.

The next day I drove to the pastor's house to confront him, but I ended up hugging him and crying instead of punching him like I wanted to do. It felt like being betrayed by a father figure since I've known him since I was in youth group. I did tell him that he needed to come clean to his wife about everything or else I would bring it up in front of the whole church.

Long story short, it was revealed that he was having an affair with four other wives in the church. Me and the husband of the other pregnant wife are fairly convinced that the timing of their pregnancies might mean that the pastor is the father, but we really don't know. The other has been in a fairly dead bedroom situation, but my wife and I were more sporadic. 

The wives have now kind of banded together to say that they were manipulated and a brainwashed by the pastor into sexual relationships. I don't even know if that's possible considering their texts showed more than consent, in my opinion. 

I haven't talked to a lawyer yet but that's the path I'm leaning towards. I would like to reconcile and believe my wife that she was just manipulated, but I can't get the thoughts out of my head about what she did with him. I'm just disgusted that somehow a guy twice her age (and twice the age of most of the other wives too) was able to seduce her. 

I told the pastor I forgive him, because I believe that's what God wants me to do. But I'm not really sure I totally forgive him in my heart. I'm having a hard time for giving my wife also. So I feel like I'm sinning by my lack of forgiveness. 

I talked to an associate pastor at the church and he thinks that reconciliation should be my number one concern, because God had joined me and my wife together and intended for us to stay together. 

My mind is just all over the place and I can barely eat or sleep. I just need to get into a better spot mentally before making any big decisions I think.

Edit: The pastor's wife said she's already forgiven him and doesn't plan to divorce. I shouldn't be upset because that's their business but it ticks me off that he seems to come out of it unscathed. They don't want to tell the rest of the church but I feel like I might have to do that.",45,1750445712.0,survivinginfidelity,126,0.87,False

It's called Gemini Studio UI. I figured someone else might find it useful, so I'm sharing it here.

It’s a pretty straightforward app that lets you run image generations using Google's Gemini Flash models. The main thing it does is let you run **multiple instances in parallel**, each with its own prompt and API key.

Here's the gist:

* **Run in Parallel:** Add a few instances, give each a different prompt, and hit ""Start All."" Great for A/B testing or just generating a bunch of stuff while you grab a coffee.
* **Wildcard Magic:** This is the best part. You can use wildcards like a portrait of a \[male|female\] with \[hair\_colors\] hair to automatically generate hundreds of unique prompts from simple text files.
* **Manage Your Stuff:** It has simple managers for your API keys and prompts so you don't have to copy-paste all the time.

I built it for my own use with the free API keys, but you can use it however you want. It's open-source, so feel free to expand on it or add things. I haven't added the newer Imagen models yet, but it should be a fairly easy modification for anyone interested.

**Quick heads-up:** I'd probably stick to using 4 instances or less at a time, just to be safe with API rate limits.

>**Susie was a year older than me and her claim to fame was that she was the ex-girlfriend of Ronnie Lane, the founder of the English rock group The Small Faces**; and Debbie was a sixteen year old who bragged that her grandfather Culbert Olson was Governor of California in the 1940’s. The two impassioned young ladies would become the dynamic duo of **recruiting males in their early twenties to meetings. Debbie dressed in an overtly sexual manner, always wearing seductive micro mini skirts before they were even a fashion statement in the early days of her shakubuku campaigning.**

>Both girls would haul groups of youths into my house for meetings by repeating “You can get anything you want by chanting.” We would ask if the guests had any questions. Night after night there were basically the same questions centering on drugs, money, and sex. It was the sixties and one of the most tumultuous and divisive eras marked by the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, antiwar protests, assassinations, and the emerging generation gap. The seekers that came through my doors were young with raging hormones looking for a place to pose questions like: “How quick does the chanting work?”, **“Would it help me get drugs, a girlfriend, or a car?”** My typical response was, “**Chant for one hundred days and you will see**,” however I realized in order to answer their more complicated questions I would need a greater understanding of Buddhist theory.

Exploiting everyone on the basis of their need and greed, their *attachments*, their weakness, their *gullibility*.

>""Also everything is a matter of timing. Just like spaghetti, there is a moment when it is perfect to eat. Likewise, now is the perfect time for the young people of America to chant. Nichiren’s teaching emphasized timing and capacity of the people.”

Ikeda-cult members always give weird food-based explanations that don't actually make any sense at all.

Oh, and lest the dog park mutts howl that this is too-ancient ""history"" to mention, they've been talking about *IKEDA* **from 1960** for *weeks* now! 

>By June 1966, we had a rhythm to our World Peace Campaign which was successfully being accomplished by eager teams of at least one male and female in their late teens to early twenties sent from the Kings Road house in the Hollywood Hills. **The basic introduction on the street would be: “Come to a Buddhist meeting, it’s really cool, and you can get anything you want!” It wasn’t a hard sell when enthusiastically voiced by pretty girls in miniskirts.**

""You can chant for whatever you want!""

>“Anything??” asked the interested recruits.

>“Yes, anything,” they were told. More tales of chanting were shared once they arrived back to the meeting. Inevitable questions were, “What if I want to become the biggest pot dealer in the world?”; “Can I chant for somebody who I really hate to be in a car accident and paralyzed”; or “Can I chant for a Porsche to be given to me for free?”

>The very next night a young man wearing a colorful shirt and sunglasses raised his hand in the middle of the meeting and blurted out, **“You say by chanting that I can get anything I want… Right?” At that moment it seemed like everyone in the room nodded their heads in tandem. Pointing at Debbie, he chuckled as he exclaimed, “I want to have sex with the Buddhist girl that brought me here tonight!!” Debbie locked eyes with mine and the room seemed to lose oxygen as everyone traded stares between our new guest and me. Debbie squirmed as I offered, “Sure, you can chant for that but, Why?” More strange sounds came from him that were almost guttural in nature as he revealed, “Because I want to and I want her!”**

See how ""safe"" it is inviting randos to shakubuku meetings?? The overtly sexual come-on is *risky!*

>I remembered something that Haruo [spaghetti man] told me regarding earthly desires. I felt the words pour out of my mouth, **“You can chant for whatever you want, but because you are tapping into the power of the universe, and your life is part of that universe from the infinite past to the infinite future, you are also in the process of fusing to the greater universal wisdom. You might not get to have sex with Debbie but you will definitely get something better or understand why. Sometimes our immediate prayers are realized, and sometimes they aren’t. When we look back later, we can say with absolute conviction that everything turned out for the best.”**

Keep that last **bolded** bit in mind.

>The guest kept nodding and staring at me as if he was mulling the concept over in his mind; however between the moans he was making and the sunglasses, he could have easily been stoned on pot. At the peak of this heightened exchange, I invited everyone in the room to gather for a special chanting session. Debbie sat nearby heatedly chanting in the highly charged room. At the end of 20 minutes I was totally soaked in sweat from the intensity of the experience and when I turned around, I didn’t see the young man in sunglasses. The group’s intention and focus had shifted the energy in the room. Protective intentions manifested and the guest had left. We never saw him again confirming “eshō-funi”, another principle of the individual and the environment being one.

Yeah, well, there ARE SGI members who counted on this kind of mystical ""protection"" ""manifesting"" and ended up MURDERED - see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/6rq5l8/a_tragic_example_of_what_happens_when_people_opt/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/2bpybp/looks_like_my_raleigh_district_wasnt_the_only_one/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/12mfr33/did_yall_here_about_the_sgi_woman_that_went/) for starters. [SGI does NOTHING to protect its members](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/uhg1ns/truly_terrible_story_of_sgi_abused_wife_murdered/i761sr5/) - it will gladly see them harmed if there's a chance some new recruits with wallets attached will result at some point.

>That singular moment was a turning point inspiring me to process Haruo’s discussion on earthly desires leading to enlightenment until refined to, “If you chant and you don’t get what you want, either you’ll understand why, you’ll get something better, or you’ll get what you need at some point in time in your life.” As **we continued practicing shakubuku on the street**, my interpretation took on many iterations from the original Japanese meaning until the words from the Buddhist principle evolved into a way of looking at life that ultimately became embedded in the world of music.

I'm just going to copy the rest - it's all WTF:

>Two months later on July 25, 1966, Robbie, Jerry, Debbie, and Susie and I took time off from our nightly Buddhist introduction meetings to go to a concert of our favorite new group called **the Rolling Stones** at the Hollywood Bowl. We were all excited, but **the two girls were frenetic in their desire to meet the band members in person. Susie decided to wear a crocheted swimsuit coverup with nothing underneath except two bandaids clandestinely placed.** After dropping her car off near Canter’s Deli on Fairfax Avenue, the five of us jammed into my Volkswagen bug and **the girls began fervently chanting all the way to the concert.**

>It had been a warm day in Los Angeles so **we rolled down the windows which excited Debbie who believed our voices would reverberate all the way to Mick Jagger and Brian Jones at the amphitheater. Both girls had Buddhist beads in their hands pointed towards the sky, screaming out the window, “I will meet the Stones. I will meet Mick! This will prove the power of the Gohonzon and the practice. It must happen!” For the next 30 minutes we chanted at the top of our lungs driving up Highland Avenue which might have seemed surreal except we were at the intersection of hippie counterculture.**

>**Immediately after the concert ended, Susie and Debbie said, “Let’s go find them.” **Susie emphatically responded to my confused look, “Remember that Buddhist thing that you told us at the meeting; earthly desires equal enlightenment? Well, this is my earthly desire. Remember you also said conspicuous prayer can produce conspicuous results!” My words were being thrown back at me so I countered, “There are four different ways that prayers are answered and that was just one of them. We already had a great night and in a sense we have been with the Rolling Stones. The Buddhist explanation is if you don’t get what you want from a deeper mystical aspect of your life being part of the universe, then you will realize that what you wanted is not the best thing for your present life. So you can have a conspicuous prayer, but there will be an inconspicuous result.” **Susie retorted, “I don’t want an inconspicuous result, I want a conspicuous one. The one I want I am conspicuously chanting for is to meet the Stones. Let’s get into the car and chant as we visit every hotel between Hollywood and Beverly Hills to somehow be led to them.”**

I saw this kind of ""magical thinking"" all around me in the SGI-USA - 4 decades later!

>One by one, we inspected every luxury hotel lobby between the Hollywood Bowl and Beverly Hills, starting at the Gene Autry Hotel, now called the Andaz, on the Sunset Strip which was a favorite haunt of rock and roll bands because of its proximity to nightclubs like the Whiskey a Go Go and the Sea Witch. Simply looking around the empty space pushed us to move onto the landmark pink palace known as the Beverly Hills Hotel. Robbie, Jerry, and I waited on a side street by an inordinate amount of limousines while **the chanting girls toured the hotel grounds** before deciding it was too quiet to be hosting the Rolling Stones. Our next stop was the Beverly Hilton Hotel, a showpiece at the center of social life in Beverly Hills.

mmmm...*STALKING!*

>The Beverly Hilton was internationally famous for its Hawaiian theme bar called Trader Vic’s, for having hosted President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and for awards shows. On the other hand, I was extremely familiar with the hotel because I resided two blocks away after moving in with my father months after my mother tragically died when I was twelve. For two years, Trader Vic’s was my sole source of daily income, causing me to learn the layout of the entire bottom floor of the building after burglarizing the restaurant for petty cash and valuables dozens of times as a middle school student.

Traumatic family-of-origin story - SO commonplace among those who end up suckered into the Dead-Ikeda-Corpse-Mentor-cult SGI.

>Now I confidently walked in the front entrance with an attitude that stated I knew where I was going, and soon established that this place was too relaxed to be hosting one of the greatest bands of all time with only one couple in the lobby and uninterested staff. **Still chanting under my breath** as I passed the front desk, I overheard the employees saying their tips were lower due to the new modern hotel that opened 100 yards west of their building. To seem less suspicious, I waited a couple of minutes before circling back to inquire if there were any other hotels nearby to which the front desk clerk repeated information about the virtually unknown Century City Plaza Hotel located closely outside the city limits. He added that the new luxury accommodations had been completed only one month ago, however final exterior work was incomplete and he didn’t think the bar was open because it was past 1:00 am.

>I ran to **my friends chanting outside** to tell them about the new discovery pumping some revitalized power into our journey. When we arrived minutes later there were piles of dirt, fertilizer, and gardening tools along with boxed plants and trees haphazardly scattered around the front entrance of the nineteen story sweeping crescent design fronting the Avenue of the Stars. We scouted potential entries into the hotel only to find the side doors, service entrance, and front door locked. I peered through the dim glass of the largest building in Century City but couldn’t see any front desk lights which was strange considering the excessive number of cars parked in the lot and around the hotel. Markedly different from the glamorous destinations we had checked out earlier that night, we reached a stalemate and departed.

>Although we guessed it might be too buttoned up to be hosting the Rolling Stones, our next stop was the historic Beverly Wilshire Hotel. I wanted to explore it further because it was a familiar locale since middle school similar to the Beverly Hilton. I felt as comfortable investigating the interior for the band as if I was searching for an item in my own apartment. Following my mother’s untimely death, my father began working at a haberdashery that sold men’s clothing and accessories located in a corridor by the main lobby of the hotel. The name of the store was Tavelman’s, and the owner hesitated in giving my father the job because when he had money he had been a regular customer of this exclusive shop. The owner was afraid the customers would only be interested in schmoozing and not buying clothes from a peer such as my father, who had tied in votes with the handsome actor Adolfe Menjou as Hollywood’s best dressed man in the late 1940’s. Perhaps it was that, or my dad‘s gift for gab landed him the job which he held for six years. I had spent enough time visiting my father to be known by staff who allowed me to wander around on different floors as an elementary school preteen. I learned the layout of the building and had a reputation akin to Eloise with her mischievous run of New York’s Plaza hotel. If the Beverly Wilshire’s general manager wasn’t present, I would receive a free “Suicide Soda” which consisted of Coca-Cola, with chocolate flavor, cherry flavor, vanilla flavor, nuts, and whip cream from the hotel. The Milton F. Kreis drug store and soda fountain had just about everything, and was the place to go for Coke or ice cream on a warm afternoon. Even though I could independently roam, my destination of choice was the kitchen since I could find free french fries and when I was lucky, a Monte Cristo sandwich. There was a strict code that the staff couldn’t eat in the kitchen, except for me since I had a free pass to go anywhere and eat anything (within reason) as the young hotel mascot whose mother had shockingly died. On a typical sojourn through the different hallways and bathrooms, I would acquire items left behind by guests, such as sunglasses, sweaters, and a silver cigarette case on one occasion. I never took anything from Tavelman’s because I was afraid my father would get in trouble if I was caught. This routine continued for about a year until I discovered surfing. Once I met the waves, my daily mission was to get to the ocean, provoking me to ditch school and hitchhike with my surfboard to the beach. Many afternoons I would sleep underneath the Malibu Pier with only a damp beach towel to keep me warm since it was difficult to catch a ride back with wet trunks and a surfboard. Within eight years, I evolved past being a master burglar to become a born-again Buddhist on a mission to save the world. 

>On the night of the concert, the skills I learned in my childhood that enabled me to survive, came to surface as we cased one hotel after another searching for the location of the Rolling Stones. By the dawn of the 1960’s, the Beverly Wilshire had seen its elegance and prestige slip a bit. Even though the staff had changed, I was surprised how much was still the same, including Tavelman’s, which gave me the confidence to move about the building as if I was a registered guest. After combing the floors and failing to hear any British accents, I exited to inform my friends that the hotel didn’t have any party energy.

>**The girls continued chanting** while Robbie, Jerry, and I decided this was the end of the road. Our hope deflated having reached a dead end at this fortress established on a foundation of glitz and glamor, but not rock ‘n’ roll. **I informed the girls we needed to go because my job unloading trucks required that I wake up in five hours and didn’t want to waste my time on the impossible. They stared at me with otherworldly eyes, fiercely stating they said they weren’t leaving and they were going to make it happen. Susie declared, “Remember we tell everyone they can get anything they want!”**

>“It’s not a magic wand. I repeat: there are different kinds of prayer with different kinds of responses. It’s in the 700 year old writing of Nichiren Buddhism. **If you want something really badly and you chant really hard for it, if you don’t get it, you will get something better, something that your life needs more, or you will understand why!” I yelled. My frustration increased since the girls had not been paying attention to the deeper theories of Buddhism but instead to the simple words I had crafted to encourage people to start chanting, “Buddhism is more than expecting to get everything you want.”**

>I believed the girl’s stance was unreasonable and illogical, so I asserted, “It’s almost 2:00 am. What’s going to happen? Even if they are here they’re probably going to sleep like I need to right now!” Realizing there was no point in trying to talk sense into **determined 16 and 21 year old groupies**, I announced that I was departing with whomever wanted to go with me. **I pleaded to Susie that, “Your car is on Fairfax Avenue and it’s 2:00 am in the morning, not to mention you are wearing only two bandaids and a fishing net! You will freeze to death. How will you get your car, walk?!” When she didn’t respond, I gave her my sweater.**

>As I drove away with only Robbie and Jerry, **I observed the two girls in my rearview mirror chanting and screaming at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.**

Yep, real ""normal"" behavior 🙄

>Susie was crying with body language appearing as if she was pleading for the building to give birth to a miracle. Even though Debbie was a teenager still figuring out her sexual identity, she was **vigorously chanting and demanding “Mick I must sleep with you! I want to sleep with you!”**

>It was a tradition for the five of us to gather nightly to talk about our activities over hot fudge sundaes and french fries at Sherry’s Restaurant on the corner of Purdue Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. I quickly became concerned and worried the next evening when only the males arrived to rendezvous but the girls never showed. It was not easy to quickly contact someone because there were no cell phones, text messages, or answering machines. We had agreed to meet at an appointed time at the restaurant and up until this point it had worked for six months. The five of us had been in daily contact and now complete silence for an entire week since the moment I pulled away from the Beverly Wilshire without them. I blamed myself for what I could have done differently in our last moments together when I abandoned them **facing the hotel chanting and crying**.

🙄

>The silence of the two girls caused me sleepless nights filled with nightmares where I spent hours pacing and chanting for their safe return. Robbie’s idiosyncratic viewpoint shared none of my concerns or anxiety, and offered zero reassurance with his opinion that, **“They are probably stoned or doing the nasty.”** On the sixth day as quickly as they had disappeared in my rearview mirror, Debbie reappeared wearing her signature ultra short miniskirt as I was chanting in a meeting. She sat next to me, leaned over and whispered, “**It was wild. I was with Mick and Brian for five days.**” She disclosed, “**I got Keith’s Richards’ girlfriend Linda to do gongyo with me for twenty minutes. The band participated singing daimoku as they drifted in and out of the room. She is definitely going to start the practice when she returns to England.**” I quickly ended the meeting because I wanted to hear everything.

>Within ten minutes the two of us were at Sherry’s Restaurant unweaving the story together since there was no way to contact Robbie or Jerry. Tucked in a corner with three orders of fries and a hot fudge sundae, the first question I asked was, “Where is Susie?”

>Even though Susie was almost 22, she lived with her very strict Jewish mother who **strongly disapproved of her Buddhist practice of six months**. We would find out later her mother was enraged after **she disappeared for a few days with the Stones**. When Susie tried to call us, her mother ripped the phone out of the wall and grounded her for an undisclosed amount of time. Susie ran to her butsudan which was in front of a wall of windows that looked out into a garden where she fell down crying as she began to chant. This was the last straw for her mother, and she became unhinged, grabbing a golf club out of the closet and smashing an entire wall of windows onto Susie who zealously chanted to her Gohonzon enshrined in the altar while the glass flew around her. Miraculously, Susie survived this explosion of glass with only a small cut on her arm.

🙄

>With Susie absent, Debbie was the only one who could convey the events that took place at the Beverly Wilshire. She shared how **they chanted exhaustively, pleading with the universe to send them the Rolling Stones to provide evidence [aka ""actual proof""]. Then Debbie had an intense desire to enter the hotel. Cold and hungry, they headed towards the soda fountain where to their astonishment sat the Rolling Stones who quickly invited them to join their party.**

>The next thing they knew, Debbie and Susie were traveling up the hotel elevator, **repeatedly whispering “It worked. It worked. It worked.”** Based on details verified by both girls, they entered the band’s reception undeterred, grabbed a glass of wine from a server, and made a beeline to different members revealing to each the power of chanting as every gorgeous model in Hollywood mingled about. Within a short amount of time a chain-smoking man in a rumpled suit escorted the other beautiful women out and asked my two Buddhist friends to stay. It was after the concert in a room littered with empty liquor bottles, full ashtrays, and half eaten hors d’oeuvres. Both girls recalled a large glass bowl with assorted colored pills sitting on a coffee table of which Susie didn’t partake. Susie couldn’t testify whether Debbie had any since they were not in constant contact, moving sometimes as a pair and sometimes singularly from one pocket of people to another. Debbie only smiled when asked if she had consumed any drugs.

Debbie was SIXTEEN (**16**) YEARS OLD

>With the room cleared of everyone except the band and their girlfriends, the shakubuku effort went into high gear transforming the girls from fans into bodhisattvas. Questions were fired at them from the band members sitting on couches. Keith Richards’ girlfriend Linda Keith entered the conversation, inquiring, **“How do you say that chant? You get what?”** According to Susie, Linda asked the most questions regarding Buddhist practice because she had a specific goal that she was having difficulty manifesting. Not satisfied simply as a model and girlfriend of Keith Richards, her singular focus and goal was promoting the most charismatic musician she had ever heard. It wasn’t Richards, rather it was an unknown backup guitar player with his own group named Jimmy James and the Blue Flames.

>Linda begged Richards to see James perform at the Cheetah Discotheque, and he was unimpressed, repeating the band didn’t need another guitar player. She dragged the Rolling Stones band manager to a place called Café a Go Go, and Andrew Oldham left, stating he wasn’t charismatic, had weird clothes including pants that were too short. Then Linda walked out of Café Wa in Greenwich Village and literally bumped into Chas Chandler, the bass player from The Animals who she convinced to see James on July 5, 1966 because, “It was clear to me,” Keith told the Guardian about her first experience of James, “I couldn’t believe nobody had picked up on him, he’s astonishing. Keith Richards, Oldham, all of them kind of blew him off, weird clothes etc. until Chas Chandler.” Three weeks later, the Beverly Wilshire Hotel reception for the Rolling Stones provided the perfect opportunity to ask questions regarding karma and destiny. **Linda and the two Buddhist girls chanted together on how to direct the course of another person’s life and is there a way to speed up time. Soon after, Chas Chandler launched Jimmy James’ career, changing his name to Jimi Hendrix and cementing Linda’s contribution to music history.**

>Even though **Debbie chanted intensely to manifest meeting Mick**, she wasn’t ready to sleep with him. At sixteen years old, she was still trying to figure out her sexual orientation which vacillated as often as she changed her socks. Today society would identify her as queer, and in the mid-60’s, she was sexually open, being part of society that was moving, shifting, and being redefined much like she was. In those early morning hours Mick played on an acoustic guitar as he sat next to Debbie seductively singing “Let’s spend the night together” a mere five months before the song was released in December 1966. **It is a mystery whether the lyrics had already been written, or perhaps the inspiration was their encounter that night.**

And of COURSE the Gakkers want you to believe it was due to Debbie's ""ichinen"" and chanting, obvs 🙄

>Debbie countered Mick’s unquestionable “cute determination to sleep with me” by using “the Buddhist term stuff” to focus his intense desire. She asserted the benefits, **telling Mick that you can get anything you want, including becoming more famous than the Beatles if he chanted for it. He wasn’t interested in that, he was interested in Debbie and her unique intensity, energy, and passion in her beliefs. Mick teased, “So, what you’re saying is if I chant, I can get anything I want, such as, if I wanted to sleep with you that would happen?”**

>Even though “he was so cute and his eyes were so puppy dog,”

Remember, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcZn2-bGXqQ&list=RDRcZn2-bGXqQ&start_radio=1) is what Mick Jagger looked like then (along with the rest of the band), before all the damage from the drugs and all that rock & roll etc.

>Debbie was on a mission so she repeated the theoretical underpinnings of how earthly desires equal enlightenment and how conspicuous prayer can result in inconspicuous response. She explained one can have earthly desires such as sleeping with somebody. If you chant, the intensity of your prayer will manifest elements even greater than your original desire. She reframed the concept again, **“If you chant for something you want, you’ll get something better, you’ll get what you need, or you’ll understand why.” None of this dissuaded Mick from his mission to bed the mysterious chanting girl who appeared at the reception with a glass of wine in her hand. Debbie refuted Jagger’s overtures, and Susie joined her recitations that chanting was powerful, going beyond wants in the moment to connect to the universe and what’s best for you.** 

>#Both Debbie and Susie take credit for the infamous statement said to Mick: “IF YOU CHANT REAL HARD, YOU MIGHT NOT GET WHAT YOU WANT, BUT YOU WILL GET WHAT YOU NEED.”

>For days, the girls accompanied the Rolling Stones to stops at places like Pink’s Hot Dogs on La Brea where they surprisingly went unnoticed. Another entire evening was spent in a studio where Mick sang for hours after they shared psychedelics. They visited clubs around Hollywood, seeing entertainers like James Brown where Debbie remembers Mick jumping on stage replicating his choreography. She traveled with the entourage in the back of Brian Jones’ limousine and recalls making out with his girlfriend fashion model Anita Pallenberg, who she describes today as “one hot mama.” Debbie and Susie were given their own rooms at the Bel Air Hotel, and when Debbie visited with the couple in their villa, “Brian had multiple toy trains going around on tracks in the living room while they were beating each other up.” She left the couple as they destroyed the cottage in a fit of sadomasochistic rock and roll debauchery. The band was forced to leave the next day when fans discovered their location and invaded the grounds in a riotous search for the members.

>By the end of the decade in 1969, the Rolling Stones released “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” with Mick Jagger as the songwriter. The track was the first song recorded for the “Let It Bleed” album and features the London Bach Choir singing the intro, adding a multi-layered spiritual feel. The sing-along chorus uplifts as it progresses through the music. Mick lyrically paints a picture of a woman waiting to score drugs at a reception, and himself as a footloose man, anxious to meet her. Although tethered to her side, he doesn’t get the girl, but sings about getting what he needs.

>Over fifty years later, the Rolling Stones cultural anthem continues to be a beacon for youth today. “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” isn’t simply **a nostalgic lyric sung at Rolling Stones concerts by aging boomers**. The hopeful words have remained vital for decades, recently resuscitated with a new generation through the climatic ending of the movie Minions: the Rise of Guru in 2022. The seed originally planted by a young UCLA student cooking stale spaghetti in Boyle Heights to a surfer kid sprouted philosophical perspectives on life as a human being within the greater cosmos.

He's determined to claim credit for this popular Stones song for the Dead-Ikeda-Corpse-Mentor-cult SGI and the magic chant, but SGI-USA is in steep decline and the Soka Gakkai and its SGI colonies are not *GROWING* anywhere in the world, no matter how many movies decide to sample this song for their soundtracks. It's so weird the way so many SGI members, particularly the longhauler Olds like this guy, want to claim credit for everyone *else's* achievements. I guess to make up for the striking lack of anything close in their *own* lives?

>The sixties frustrated and disillusioned many of the younger generation’s idealism yet also harvested new ideas. Then as now, the timing is right for people to understand the principles of Buddhism, such as earthly desires equalling enlightenment. The capacity of the people is here again. Although it might not look perfect over the next few years with setbacks and frustration, the youth are ready. They won’t always get what they want but they will get what they need ….and will build on it.

Or they don't and they quit - which was the response of over 99% of everyone who ever *tried* it in the USA - [according to SGI-USA's OWN statistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/1ld0ac5/over_the_hedges/myoc812/).

He's misogynistic and cold, and he talks to young girls on the internet. I don't think he should have any kind of custody, since he's an awful person, but after a brutal custody battle, I was forced to allow him to have our daughter every weekend. He's a classic ""facebook dad"" if you know what that means. Every time our daughter comes back to my place I have to go through a whole checklist to make sure nothing happened.

We usually do the swap in public because I am not comfortable being alone with him and I don't want him at my house. So we meet in the parking lot of a very busy coffee place. A few weeks ago, while doing the swap, I was trying to tell him some important things he needed to be aware of, and as usual he was ignoring me and just loading up his car. Our daughter was out of the car. We parked next to the grass, in a corner spot, so she wandered over to the grass to play with some dandelions I guess. And a strange man grabbed her.

It was very sudden and scary, and she didn't make a peep. Some guy just grabbed her and started walking. My ex saw them, and dropped her bike and rushed over. He pulled her away from the man and punched him in the mouth, and the man ran away.

It was pretty awful. We spent the entire day talking to police and dealing with that, and we also had to go to the hospital because I guess when my ex pulled her away, the other guy was still holding on, and her shoulder was dislocated.

I fought with my ex about taking her home with me but he insisted it was his time and he was going to take her, and eventually he just left with her.

Ever since then, she only wants to be around him. When she's home, she doesn't sleep, she wakes up screaming sometimes, she fights me when I try to put her to bed or comfort her, she actually split my lip open because she woke up thrashing and i tried to hug her and she swatted my face. She freaks out and she won't calm down. I've had to break down and let my ex video call her to get her calmed down enough to sleep. She won't even let me touch her, and when we go to trade, she's practically ripping her seatbelt off so she can run to him and hug him. Every time she is supposed to come home she throws a massive tantrum. And now because of this my ex is demanding he get her for 2 extra days a week to ""Help her"".

I understand that she is traumatized. I am putting her into therapy (and of course her dad isn't contributing at all). I understand that he made her feel safe by stopping the snatcher. But he isn't a safe person, he's a dangerous person. And I'm frustrated that he gets to be the hero in everyone's eyes after everything he's done.",1,1750445507.0,AmIOverreacting,6,0.6,False

It's called Gemini Studio UI. I figured someone else might find it useful, so I'm sharing it here.

It’s a pretty straightforward app that lets you run image generations using Google's Gemini Flash models. The main thing it does is let you run **multiple instances in parallel**, each with its own prompt and API key.

Here's the gist:

* **Run in Parallel:** Add a few instances, give each a different prompt, and hit ""Start All."" Great for A/B testing or just generating a bunch of stuff while you grab a coffee.
* **Wildcard Magic:** This is the best part. You can use wildcards like a portrait of a \[male|female\] with \[hair\_colors\] hair to automatically generate hundreds of unique prompts from simple text files.
* **Manage Your Stuff:** It has simple managers for your API keys and prompts so you don't have to copy-paste all the time.

I built it for my own use with the free API keys, but you can use it however you want. It's open-source, so feel free to expand on it or add things. I haven't added the newer Imagen models yet, but it should be a fairly easy modification for anyone interested.

**Quick heads-up:** I'd probably stick to using 4 instances or less at a time, just to be safe with API rate limits.

Here are a couple of screenshots of the interface:

1lgbvc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lgbvc8/my_33m_husbands_text_message_to_his_29f_female/,My 33M husband's text message to his 29F female coworker bothered me,"So my husband 33M and I 31F have been together for 8 years, married for 2 years. He used to work with this female coworker 29F  before we were married and I was aware of their close friendship. I've met her and her boyfriend at a work event, they were lovely. 

6 months ago, my husband and I were in South America for a wedding. Everyone in his family was there, it was a fun trip. However, during one of our more drunken nights, he messaged his coworker of how drunk he was and how much fun he's having. I knew this because I saw a notification of her reply. I have never snoop on my husband's phone before this. 

She already worked at a different place and I was surprised they kept in touch. Guess I felt upset that he's with me and drunk text another girl. Didn't tell him though, I got over it pretty quickly. 

Fast forward to 2 months ago, this coworker came back to his workplace in which they would lead a team together. They sit beside each other, coffee breaks and lunch together and even wait for each other to go to and back the office from the train station (about a 10 min walk). They would message each other if they would be late so the other person don't have to wait. He was very vocal with this when he tells me how his day went. I didn't care. Or at least I thought I didn't.

3 weeks ago, we both had a day off so I planned to go to this new restaurant. While at the restaurant, I saw him text the coworker how this new place is nice and that he recommends it. He showed me the conversation. This really really bothered me. I got so upset we didn't finish our food and just went home.

Once at home, I told him of my boundaries, I am upset that he text his coworker when he's with me. Our times together are very precious because we work different hours (I work night shifts as a nurse) I was crying and he was super respectful and that from now on, it will just be work talk.

Yesterday, I don't know why but I went through his messages. They talk 90% about work. But there were some very personal stuff in there (like how strained his relationship with his parents were). And very recently he messaged her, ""I'm depressed I'm all alone"" (she called in sick I guess)

I am gonna start therapy. That's already booked since I have insecurities. I'm not sure if I should confront him about this again. Or just work on myself for now. What do you think I should do?

1lgbuzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1lgbuzj/rate_my_prose/,Rate My Prose,"Please critique my prose from Chapter 12 of my zero draft unfinished manuscript WIP, an excerpt of **WIZARDS, OREGON**, by myself, K. R. Hartley:

⁂

Under the evening fever the voices dance and as the clock spins the population of Wizards mills amongst itself and exchanges hands while the season rusts at its edges and falls to a new world. The evening lands in a sporadic cloud, the sands of summer falling by the minute. All around the weather grows thick and hangs in the street, silver and steam creeping up the bricks. Dampness passes in the air and through the lens of a yellow window the figure of Aaron Anders labors onward in his work, measuring himself in problems solved, granular daylight wins. And as the dusk idles homeward, the fog makes its stand and the city lights smolder in the company of so many long returning creatures to their overnight posts, resurfacing in legion from the grass and hissing in the borealis.

Today Aaron makes his morning drive, though today Aaron has decided that he will take a different path to work. Today he has decided that he will avoid the swamp and the witch that lives there, and by doing so altogether avoid undergoing any involuntary prognostications that might involve or otherwise implicate him in such unwarranted clashes with fate. Today he will turn a different way. And so, offward down farmers’ roads, over timber bridges, alongside the brooks and up the hill to the asphalt of the national highway, Aaron Aaron pilots himself with intention. The sedan hugs the road, descends the loop, and comes into the parking lot.

At his desk he speaks into his telephone.“Missus Bradley. Good to hear from you.” The voice on the other side of the call snaps through the phone and Aaron holds it from his ear. He brings it back. “Yes, ma’am. A house call?” He stretches his arm and looks at his wristwatch. “Sure. Shouldn’t be a problem. Okay. I look forward to it.” He hangs up and spins in his chair. The office chatters with activity.

Sloan slinks in from the crowd and slides into a chair. She takes him in the eye, excited. “Absolutely incredible. Can you believe it? So. Who’s next?”

“Good morning. How’s your head?”

“Wouldn’t you like to know? Answer the question.”

“I don’t know what to believe.”

“So, who’s next?” She adjusts her hair and leans forward. “Who’s next on the chopping block?”

“I don’t know. I took a different route.”

“What do you mean?”

Aaron reaches for his coffee and sits back and cradles it under his chin. “I didn’t go past the billboard. And I didn’t have a vision.”

“You didn’t?”

“No. I didn’t. And trust me. I feel better already. I’m probably saving lives.”

She comes back and crosses her legs. “You seriously took a different way? So that you could specifically circumvent the billboard? And keep from having a vision?” She shakes her head. “Aaron. You’ve been given a gift and you are purposely choosing to squander it? Look around. Can’t you see that this is—*hey*. Look around.”

Aaron inspects the room, sarcastic and irritated. 

“This is a fucking miracle. Okay? A blessing. *Divinatory* shit, like. superhuman superpowers. You can’t afford to just—*piss in the violin*. You have to use this.”

“I’m only trying to buy a little time. I have more ambitious goals.” He sips his cup. “Bigger ideas. Really big if the things you’re talking about are true, divine powers, or whatever.”

“So. Tell me your plan.”

Aaron finishes his coffee and puts it on the desk. “I’ll tell you when I get back. I have to make a house call.”

Sloan stands. “Fuck that. I’m coming. I’ll drive.”

The wind pushes the clouds to the west and the treetops swing under the vultures, hills in the distance, fields of gold broken by wide stands of oak. The Humvee growls and echos off the glens as it divides the landscape like a beast on the chase. They come by neatly arranged fences, a large and placid yard. She slows the vehicle and turns off the highway and pulls up to a ranch and parks. Inside the two of them share some words before the passenger door opens and Aaron steps out. “I won’t be long.”

He makes his way over the yard and up to the house and knocks on the door. A woman answers with a grunt and yells something behind herself and disappears. Aaron steps inside.

“Greetings, Missus Bradley. Such a pleasure to see you again.”

“Keep talking shit, buster! I got all day to waste accomodatin’ your niceties!”

Aaron follows her into the kitchen where across the table are spread the many disbanded papers of some disheveled life insurance policy, several bearing conspicuous signatures. “I trust these are all signed.” He gestures. 

“Damn skippy.” She slumps in her seat and lets out a noise. Aaron gathers up the paper and squares the pages and folds them and puts them into his coat.

“On the phone you told me that Mister Bradley was here. Is that true?”

She points at the kitchen window and he looks in its direction. “Out back.” Aaron exits the room.

Outside the world rises up from the distant peaks and spreads itself over the rolling fields, sky in every direction. Cutting the wide blue vault in half the white contrail of a jet engine clips hither, miles above, demarcing the world and accompanied by a gentle roar. Over a lookout near the edge of a crest an old man squints, studying the estate. Aaron approaches, sidles up beside the man and speaks.

“Mister Bradley? May I have a word?”

The man nods.

“Mister Bradley. Did you sign those documents inside?”

He nods.

“And are you aware that those documents bind you in law as the policyholder of that life insurance plan?”

The man keeps his gaze ahead. “Yes.”

“And that in the event of your unfortunate demise, the death benefit, as stipulated in the policy, would go to your beneficiary, your ex-wife?” Aaron points at the house. “Missus Bradley?”

“I’m aware.”

Aaron tilts his head and nods and stands quietly.

The old man focuses on something distant before he closes his eyes and opens them again. In through the nose and out through the mouth. “Listen, son. This is exactly what it looks like. Sometimes you have to cross the bridge long after you come to it.” The man turns to face Aaron. “Did you know? My father’s been in the mayor’s chair of this once humble town for plumb-near fifty years? Normal people don’t come up like I did. He was mean.” He pauses and spits to the side. “He was mean as they get. And he foisted his whole name right onto me. One man’s entire denomination placed upon another’s. Not once after that did he give me a tick but for all of sweet Fanny Adams. Unless you count the almost never ending series of lickins that lasted until I was fast enough to run without turning round.” 

Aaron takes the man in the eyes, his years shining behind rings of dark blue, ages lost beneath the surface. The worlds of both individuals become sealed in a moment that seems to last a lifetime and the old man shakes his head. His gaze returns to the land. 

“But I never could escape my destiny. He wasn’t a good man. And nor was I. I was not good to my wife. And she left me. Rightfully. And I never was able to rightfully make up for the things I done to her. And no matter how hard I ever did try, and I did try, for many years, I never could get off the path that took me here. He passed it down to me, you see. James the Second, he used to call me. Like I ever had a choice in the matter. He put a grip on me so tight, I never learned to love right. You know what I mean?” The man bows his head. “I would do anything for that woman inside there. I would do anything to make things right again.” He touches his forehead. “But sometimes the only way to make things right, I wager, is to simply sit back and let the Lord Almighty strike you down with lightning for everything you ever done to deserve such a fate as this.”

“Mister Bradley. Consider your life insurance policy officially in effect.” Aaron turns toward the house. “I’d recommend staying off of any tall ladders, or rooftops. Or operating any heavy machinery.” He crosses the yard and makes his exit and soon he is heard leaving offward down the road in a loud truck. 

The old man looks off into the enormous dome, the contrail slowly dissipating and drifting across the void. From the great expanse a miniscule form can be seen, almost indiscernible, descending the horizon. As it grows it turns, flying ever closer, some wayward meteorite, expanding and rotating in space. The man leans forward and narrows his vision. The artifact becomes larger, its trajectory now terminal, beyond the point of no return, this hopelessly inordinate cannonball, tumbling out of the day and onto the stage. What could it be? And of course, what else should better please the reader than to learn of this simple demonstration of fate, aptly patent as falling debris, the severed landing gear of an aircraft, and free from any and all occupation but than to simply plummet, presenting itself like the ultimate factor of events ever hence, an outlier and a kingmaker, and of questionable interest, or even met with possible ignorance by those concerning themselves with matters of fanciful kismet such as the reader, I dare say, the catalytic hand of the stars, what else? Watch now. Here it comes. 

And so it goes, and as it does so too goes James Arnold Bradley the Second, dashed away in a merciful torrent of metal and rubber that breaks over the bluff and settles in scattered fire, wreckage across the grass and smoke against the sky. With the wind in her hair and her arms asunder the woman steps out from the backdoor and onto the dirt. She looks to the ruins, then to the sky, and then back, flames in her eyes and a grin on her face.

1lgbu1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/1lgbu1g/strange_substance_coming_out_to_the_printed/,Strange substance coming out to the printed circuit board of my laptop. What is it?,"After 1 year, I have opened my laptop for the first time in order to clean the printed circuit board, remove old thermal paste from cpu and gpu (as they were overheating with cpu temps up to 95 C) and apply new thermal paste. But after opening it, I have discovered something I had never seen before: not only my laptop has thermal paste on cpu and gpu cores, but there is also a very strange paste or substance coming out from all the 4 edges of cpu core and gpu core. I haven't touched this substance with my fingers but it appears to my eyes like solidified grey bubbles at the four edges of the cpu and of the gpu, as you can see from these pics I have attached (see the red arrows in the pics). I tried to press those bubbles with a coffee filter to avoid leaving lints but they seem hard, not soft. They remained intact.

So my question is, what is exactly this substance? I had never found it in any of my previous laptops in the past. Is it necessary that it remains there? Or should I remove it? If I leave it there, can this substance ruin the electronics of the laptop or damage/corrode the printed circuits with the time? Is there the risk my laptop will no longer turn on and stop functioning?

And if yes, how do I clean this strange bubbles substance at the four edges? I don't want to damage my gpu and cpu cores so I don't know what to do. If removed wrongly, can I accidentally cause cpu and gpu sliding for some inch from their physical slot and stop functioning? If I don't clean it, there is also the risk that this substance creates too much thickness and that it will prevent the thermal paste from making a good gpu and cpu core contact and effective cooling after I put the heatsink back on. What should I do?

1lgbsey,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCareerAdvice/comments/1lgbsey/how_do_i_host_a_small_meetup/,How do I host a small meetup?,"Hey y’all,

I am currently located about 1 hour away from a big city in the US and I’ve done a ton of research into local meetups for information security and GRC professionals there. Unfortunately, it seems the groups on LinkedIn, Eventbrite, and MeetUp are not as active as I’ve hoped, just totally unresponsive, or have already had their annual events. And I don’t have a Facebook.

I wonder if, on a very small scale, this is something I might be able to arrange on my own? I’m a fairly organized girl, have about 4 years experience in this field, and know the target I want to reach. My problem: I’m also kind of a noob with zero experience hosting these things and want to make sure I’m considering more than the above. So what do you recommend I do, to get started and be successful in this?

Please note that I am NOT looking to hold a large event with sponsors and dozens of people. I’m thinking more of a coffee shop or local park kind of thing. 

If you have any tips, suggestions, or constructive feedback — I’m all ears!

TLDR;
Where is the best place to spread the word about a small and local tech meetup, with little to no resources? And how?

In this weird world where nature and magic have come back to life, you’ll need to sacrifice cards to summon creatures and cast spells.  
The game is filled with quirky creatures, strange plants, and some jokes and lore along the way.

I have the kind of ADHD where I'm zoned out and can't keep myself focused on a task because my mind wanders everywhere. My brain is like a dog that needs to stop and sniff every bush and wants to run up to everyone for pats while I'm constantly dragging on the leash trying to get it to actually take a walk with me. My very non-expert research tells me this is related to norepinephrine. Apparently, my problems are not the type associated with dopamine, which I mention because I don't know whether L-theanine works equally well for that type of ADHD.

Recently I started taking 200mg of L-theanine with my afternoon coffee. I feel like my brain has gone to dog-training school. I can actually sit down and complete a work project without completely losing my train of thought every time I have to switch tabs or search old messages for a piece of information. My brain has changed from a spoiled puppy into some kind of well-trained retriever that quickly fetches me whatever I need and sits there patiently waiting for my next instructions. 

The change has not been gradual, it started the very first day I tried out the L-theanine. I am now going to be taking it in the mornings too because it turns out I like being able to remember what I'm doing for more than 5 minutes at a time. ",73,1750445094.0,adhdwomen,31,1.0,False

1lgbnwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1lgbnwi/321_fucking_fired/,321.. FUCKING FIRED.,"As the header says, today I have been fired from this godforsaken company. So I’d like to spew all of the awful shit this company has put me through.

1. My uncle had died the day I was supposed to start so it got pushed back a week. My manager at the time had made a comment about how he hope the rest of my family stays alive so I don’t have to be out so often.

2. A month of me working I slipped and fell on my side and had the largest bruise I thought I broke something. I was told if I wanted I could stay home for a few days until it becomes bearable.

3. I have a coworker who was lgbt and hated me for being lgbt. Make it make sense.

4. My manager touched me inappropriately then begged me that it was just an accident and I didn’t need to report him because then I’d lose my job.

5. I had a costumer throw burning hot coffee on me and my shift on the floor did nothing.

6. I had to take a medical leave for a new found heart issue that I had never fucking had! And I was told I only developed it because of stress funny enough the only stressful factor that had occurred was me working at Starbucks and dealing with the high school like drama it brews.

7. I transferred to a new store because of the distasteful environment of my first store. The first week I’m in I get misgendered and I bring the issue up to my manager and she says and I quote, “it’s okay we’ll figure it out.” The proceeds to misgender me in the same statement and sends me home. Lol

8. I continued to get misgendered and harassed at work. I don’t even talk to anyone.

9. I’m allergic to only the oatly oatmilk and a coworker who KNEW I was allergic proceeds to give me a sample of a drink she made without telling me that it had oatmilk and I had to run to the back to take some Benadryl. Then still had to work the last 3 hours of my shift.

10. I transfer to a new store and my new manager is sweet and kind. Just very by the book which is okay I guess. She makes up come in with 4-6 feet of snow outside only for no customers to come in!

 11. I sprained my ankle at the store and the next day had to work a 13 hour shift! Because there were so many call outs.

12. I was made a barista trainer but was only given 20 ish minutes before I had to train a new barista, and had to do all of the barista trainer training within that time.

13. I was forced to work an 8 hour shift then had to train for about 9 hours after that! So I worked a whole day 17hrs without being notified!

14. I moved to a different state and finally became a shift after almost 3 years of being in the company. Only for all the others shifts to basically try and haze me into their little clique (I did not conform and went about my time.)

15. Said shifts kept lying on my name, that I was forgetting pulls, over ordering, missing inventory counts, missing safe counts.

16. There is a barista into little girls! And the manager knew but did nothing about it. 

17. Same barista kicked the back door into one of our pregnant coworker! Company still did not fire him! 

18. New manager comes in and is completely friendly in an “I’m about to ruin your lives” kinda way. Manager misgenders me.

19. Manager writes me up for writing in the book when we were having intense snow storms and arrived late for work or had to close the store early.

20. Ceiling falls in almost on a customer too and manager sends us home without paying us. 

21. Manager writes me up for switching shifts through the app with other shifts. 

22. The final banger… today I come into work and manager sits me down to write up an email about a coworker who called another coworker a whore (completely unwarranted) then lets me get on the floor for five minutes call me to the back and tells me I’m fired. Lets me go to the bathroom and relax. I go back to the back and put my apron on thinking I’m going to finish the rest of my shift. Nope after I finished putting it on he says that I can clock out and thanks me for my time.

What kind of mother would I be to do that to my son once, let alone everyday of summer until he starts school in Sept. Mom goes “he’s lucky to be growing up in this business”. During all this setting up the shop, my brother flies home from across the county to help for 1 week, and he tells me to shut the fuck up. My mom stuck up for him & I quit. For more in depth details, you can look at that post if you want.

Anyway, I went no contact for 2 weeks and it’s been peaceful and amazing. 

Today, I got a call from my dad. I didn’t answer. Then a text that said “please call me”. I haven’t talked to him either because I took his silence for being on their side. I called to see what he wanted. He goes “hi, as your father, I need you to apologize & start talking to your mom again. Everything is going wrong at the shop. We aren’t open yet. It’s been a disaster. Talk to your brother again too. They love (my son) and I did a lot for you as your father so you need to apologize.” I was like “wtf… I didn’t do anything wrong. They need to apologize to me before I even consider speaking to them.” He goes “ok so I take that as a no?” I said “no” and he said that you are wrong because he doesn’t care who said what to who & after everything I did for you” & hung up. My parents favorite thing to say even at my grown age is “after everything we did for you” which I explained last post that they provided an average childhood for me. 

I take that call as they still haven’t opened yet, they want my free help, they have no idea how to run a business, and they miss my son. They don’t care about me though & it’s very clear. Since he has called, it’s been eating me alive that he and they really think I’m wrong. Am I? What do I do? I’m struggling. ",5,1750444808.0,toxicparents,1,1.0,False

# SOUTHERN MAMA'S SANITY DIARY #
## June 20, 2025

Y'all, my azaleas are BLOOMING despite Stacey's ""content creation"" trampling them weekly. Made my special honey-lavender pound cake for the garden club meeting (recipe below if you behave).

Found Gypsy doing yoga in MY vegetable garden this morning. Nearly dropped my coffee when she went into downward dog wearing that excuse for workout wear. At least she didn't crush my heirloom tomatoes.

Speaking of tomatoes - anyone else's plants producing early this year? Mine are absolutely DRIPPING with fruit. Planning to can some this weekend, assuming Kenny doesn't turn them into ""organic paintballs"" first.

Lord give me strength... and maybe a stronger fence.


RACHEL'S HONEY-LAVENDER POUND CAKE

*The secret's in the infusion, darlings*

• 3 cups flour (sifted twice)
• 1 cup unsalted butter (room temperature)
• 4 large eggs
• 1 cup buttermilk
• 2½ cups sugar
• 2 tablespoons fresh lavender buds
• ¼ cup local honey
• 1 teaspoon vanilla
• ½ teaspoon salt
• ½ teaspoon baking powder

Infuse lavender in warm buttermilk for 30 minutes, strain. Cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time. Mix dry ingredients separately. Alternate adding dry mixture and buttermilk. Fold in honey. Bake at 325° for 70 minutes.

Glaze with honey-lavender drizzle while warm.

*Serve with sweet tea or champagne, depending on your company's moral standards.*


TOP 10 SIGNS YOU'VE GOT TOO MANY HOUSEMATES:

1. Finding unfamiliar underwear in your laundry (Stacey's thongs keep appearing)
2. Grocery bill higher than your first mortgage
3. Coffee pot perpetually empty by 7AM
4. Bathroom schedule requires military precision
5. Wine bottles disappearing faster than your patience
6. Six different shampoos but nobody buys toilet paper
7. Kitchen sink contains mysteries science can't explain
8. Your favorite mug now holds someone's vape pens
9. Can identify everyone by their footsteps at 2AM
10. Started fantasizing about living in a shed

*Maybe I should've kept that real estate business after all...*

Not the gigantic holographic mech that loomed over the entrance gates, nor the crowd flowing between its legs into the massive maw that was the arena entrance.

It was the food.

Idly, he pondered whether or not he wanted to wander over to the nearest foodtruck to peruse their wares, before deciding against it.

Reluctantly.

Because his embossed ticket chit stated that it entitled him the right to sit in a box seat, which, in addition to providing a ‘superior view of the spectacle’ also entitled him to a number of ‘small menu options’.

Which was fortunate for his bank account, because he shuddered to think what a place like this would upcharge for a few nibbles. Hell, he was trying hard not to think about how much the ticket in his hands would normally cost.

Still, he’d not deny which of the two dining venues he would have preferred if given a choice. Unfortunately, his inner chef refused to let him let ‘free’ food go to waste because he was hankering for something more ‘authentic’.

Sighing, he turned away from the nearest truck.

On the bright side, as he stared out, he’d realized he’d be able to avoid the tight press of the main entrance. His ticket entitled him access to the VIP entrance. Which he now realized he could see from here, the small passageway guarded by a fairly intimidating looking Nighkru woman in full body armor. More noticeable though was the rather vicious looking machine gun slung across her chest.

Which seemed a little like overkill for a venue like this to his mind, before a casual glance at the people around him told him otherwise.

More of them than not were armed with some manner of side-arm. And, as far as he could tell, none were being stopped at the entrance for being so.

The scanners were for tickets – not weapons, apparently.

*I guess that’s just another Krenheim thing,* he thought with a shake of his head.

His own pistol was still at home, sitting on the kitchen table. He’d have to remember to bring it in future. Not because he particularly wanted to, but because there was no chance he was going to be the only one without a gun the next time he went somewhere!

…It was a shame he’d not been able to bring Jelara with him. Alas, he’d only been given the one ticket, and by the time he’d gotten back from the estate, she’d left for… whatever her day job was.

Just as he was getting ready to make for the arena’s private entrance, he paused as a voice called out to him over the throng of the crowd around him.

“Ah, Mark. I’m glad you made it.”

He turned, surprised to see Tenir walking towards him through the crowd, her voice cutting through the din with practiced ease. And as surprising as it was to see Kalia’s manager here, what was even more so was her attire.

She wasn’t in her usual sleek business clothes. Instead, the Nighkru was decked out in a short sleeved crop top with some manner of foreign lettering emblazoned across the front in big bold lettering. Underneath, sat a screaming Nighkru skull covered in flames.

Was that… a band shirt of some kind?

That was… he didn’t know what to say. It was the last thing he could ever imagine the very businesslike woman wearing the last time he’d met her.

Hell, now that she was closer, he could actually see she had an honest to god belly-button piercing. A simple gold stud that stood out against the surprisingly flat curve of her silver stomach.

That, combined with her tight fitting jeans and the fact that she’d let her dark hair down left her looking… surprisingly normal.

Approachable.

Casual.

All words he’d never before thought to describe the Nighkru.

“Tenir?” Mark said, managing to stop just short of staring. “I, uh, didn’t expect to see you here.”

Again, he was surprised when rather than respond right away, the Nighkru shifted her weight slightly from one foot to the other. “Well, this being your first live viewing of a mech fight, Kalia thought you might appreciate some… accompaniment for the evening.”

She gestured at the thronging crowds around them. “Not that I disagree. I know that to a newcomer all of this can be a little overwhelming.” She hesitated, before adding. “Assuming you’re fine with me accompanying you, of course?”

“No, that’s great. I’m glad for the company.”

Mark’s lips twitched into a smile. He was surprised, sure, but not unpleasantly so. He’d just been thinking that he wouldn’t mind having a ‘friend’ with him for his first viewing experience. And while Tenir definitely hadn’t been the first person to leap to mind for such a role, with the way she looked now…

Tenir caught his lingering gaze, her head tilting slightly. “Is something wrong? Do I have something on me?”

Mark chuckled, shaking his head. “No, nothing like that. I’m just a little surprised by your clothes.” One would almost think he’d struck her by the way she all-but flinched, so he quickly specified. “It looks good. Not that you don’t look good normally, but this is, well, it’s nice seeing another side of you.”

Her silver eyes widened, and a faint flush darkened her cheeks, as she glanced to the side. “Well, it wasn’t like I was born into a business suit. I do have a life outside of work.”

It was almost comical how quickly the poised manager unraveled under a simple compliment. Alien women, he’d learned, were just as weak to flattery as human men back on Earth were to a well-timed smile.

Maybe more so, given their cultural wiring.

“So I’m seeing,” he said, enjoying the way she seemed to flush deeper as he continued to stare. “If nothing else, it’ll be interesting to get to know you outside of a work context.” He paused, as if in thought. “Unless of course this is work for you? Making sure the estate’s newest employee stays out of trouble?”

She cleared her throat, regaining some composure. “Not at all. I hope this will be enjoyable for both of us.”

He grinned. “Well, then, shall we go in?”

Tenir’s shoulders relaxed, a relieved nod following as she fell into step beside him. “Yes, let’s.”

Mark had a feeling the next hour or two were going to be a lot of fun.

And not just because he was about to get to watch some giant robots smash each other to pieces.

Though that certainly helped.

\----------------

These were very good seats, Mark could admit that much.

From up here, he had a perfect view of the spectacle down below, as two massive machines dueled it out over a soccer field sized ruined cityscape.

As he watched, sparks flew from one of the machines – the red one - as a blue laser lanced out from its opponent to spear it in the shoulder. The metal there turned bright orange, foaming and bubbling as it superheated in moments.

“It’s just the outer armor,” Tenir said dismissively as the machine ducked into cover and out of the beam’s path. “Didn’t scratch the internals.”

Mark barely heard, watching as the laser instead splashed out against the arena’s transparent outer panels instead – and despite himself, Mark flinched.

He needn’t have bothered, as whatever wonderous material the transparent material that surrounded the arena was made of, it was clearly laser resistant. More to the point, it also seemed capable of auto-tinting, as the transparent surface turned dark and opaque where the laser splashed against it.

The crowd packed into the stands below loved it, roaring even louder as the beam cut out and the tinted streak across the glass once more turned transparent.

“Thermo-glass,” Tenir said, visibly amused by his reaction as she nursed something vaguely alcoholic. “Expensive as hell to build and maintain, but nothing short of sustained fire to a single point is going to scratch it. At least, not with laser fire.”

Mark was still watching the match, but that did raise a question for him.

“What about kinetic weapons?” he asked. “Saria said Kalia’s spare mech had a ‘Particle Cannon’.”

He was pretty sure that meant it was kinetic. A particle was a… thing, after all. A thing you threw really fast.

The Nighkru raised a single eyebrow at that, visibly surprised. “There are grav-emitters on the outer ring of the arena. I won’t get into the details, because I don’t really know how it works myself – that’s more Saria’s thing - but I do know that it’s capable of no-selling any kind of particle cannon or beam.”

Mark nodded. That was a good enough explanation for him. It was also nice to see Tenir had relaxed a bit. She’d seemingly gained a bit more confidence as they settled into the private booth, talking about the two competitors – this was apparently a fairly low-tier fight between two relative amateurs – and helping him order from the automated menu system.

“Are other kinds of kinetic weapons allowed? I’m not seeing any guns on those two,” he said, both out of genuine curiosity and to keep her talking. “Just lasers.”

Lasers that had clearly been tuned to a visible wave-length. Because he knew that Shil laser weaponry was invisible to the naked eye.

Usually, the only indicators a person would get that a Shil was shooting at them were the whip-cracks of suddenly ionized air and the sight of whatever said lasers *hit.* He’d been young enough that he didn’t remember too much of the of the occupation-war, but he remembered *that.*

“And missile racks,” Tenir added cheerfully, ignorant of his grim internal musings. “They’re just waiting to use those until the other has built up sufficient heat that they can’t reliably use their anti-missile systems. Given those are also laser based.” She paused, considering her words. “And no, conventional kinetics aren’t banned. You just aren’t likely to see many in a match like this.”

“Why’s that?” he asked, shaking off his momentary funk.

He was here to enjoy himself after all.

“Cost, mostly,” Tenir shrugged. “Any kind of kinetic delivery system requires the ability to self-terminate before hitting the thermo-glass. For missiles, they’ve already got a guidance system, so installing a self-termination procedure’s more a matter of software than anything else.”

Mark nodded, seeing the problem. “But installing those sensors on every round of ammunition fired is going to make the cost go up exponentially.”

Once again, Tenir seemed pleasantly surprised. “Exactly! And while that might not be too much of an issue in higher end matches where the pilots are making big money, for these lower tier matches it usually makes more sense just to stick with energy weapons unless you’re going for something with a very slow fire rate. And even then, well, energy weapons are cheaper to upkeep.”

They watched as down below, the red mech fired off a sundering volley of missiles that arced up over the house they’d been hiding behind to fly towards the blue one. The blue mech wasted no time in darting to the side, jets of fire blasting out of the thrusters dotted across its torso as it skated to the side. As it did, the nodules dotted across its shoulders revealed themselves to actually be small laser-pods, looking for all the world like disco-balls as they set about shooting down as many of the incoming threats as they could.

It was a thrilling sight, and Mark held his breath as the air filled with explosions. Beside him, Tenir scoffed.

“Too soon,” she muttered as the blue mech managed to avoid the bulk of the incoming salvo – leaving only one side of its torso slightly scorched. “Morel isn’t even close to her heat threshold yet. And now Larkin’s spent most of her missile reserve.”

Something the now named Larkin seemed to realize as Morel started to advance on her – despite the damage she’d just taken. The two mechs looked like they were skating as their thrusters propelled them across the ruined cityscape on feet that were barely a meter off the ground - all the while exchanging blistering laser and particle fire.

It wasn’t long at all before the formerly pristine machines were raked with deep ragged gouges, their paintwork chipped and blackened where rivulets of molten metal dripped down their bodies before hardening once more.

Larkin’s right arm hung limp, the massive laser there now dull and lifeless. Fortunately, she still had her shoulder mounted particle cannons, but they had a slow cycle time, one that was allowing Morel to edge ever closer as the two darted about.

And Mark doubted that the mace held in the blue mech’s right hand was just for show.

As they watched the match turned game of cat and mouse, he spared a glance at Tenir.

“So, how’d Kalia get into this?” he asked, curiosity tugging at him. “I assume it’s not part of the family business.”

Tenir’s lips curved into a small smile. “She joined the university team.”

“There’s a university for piloting?” Mark raised an eyebrow, half-expecting some elite academy for mech jocks.

She laughed, a soft, melodic sound that cut through the arena’s din. “Ha, no. We aren’t the Imperium. She was at school to get her masters in business management. That was actually where we met.”

She sounded a bit wistful at that last bit, though Mark found himself more preoccupied by the idea that his employer went to school to be a businesswoman of some description and had somehow ended up as a mecha pilot.

“Oh? Bit of a leap from spreadsheets to laser fire.”

He gestured at the arena, where Larkin’s mech dodged a crushing blow, only to take a laser to its flank from Morel’s shoulder mounts.

Tenir leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table between them. “Less than you might think. As you’ve seen, mechs are a big deal on Krenheim. Most universities worthy of the name have at least one team. And most kids at some point want to be a gladiator when they grow up. Kalia was and is no exception.”

Huh, that university bit sounded a little like college football – and likely saw similar investments. Back on Earth, universities poured millions into their teams—stadiums, coaches, recruiting. Big money. Here, the investment had to be even more astronomical to churn out machines like these.

Idly, he wondered if people could get into university here on a ‘gladiator scholarship’? If so, what did it say about Kalia that she ended up being a team pilot?

“If that’s the case, I imagine there’d be stiff competition for a piloting role?” he asked. “Seems a little odd it’d go to a business management student.”

Tenir scoffed. “You’d be right about that. And a lot of people like to claim Kalia’s mother pulled strings to get Kalia her slot.” She eyed him, gaze turning deadly serious. “She didn’t. Kalia aced those sim fights and earned that spot entirely on her own.” She sat back, scowling. “The fact that she’s now piloting professionally should be proof enough of that. No matter who her sponsors are.”

Mark swallowed a bit, but nodded – even as he filed that tidbit away for later. It seemed that accusations of nepotism were a bit of a sore spot for his employer.

Below, the match continued, and he subtly changed the subject. “Well, piloting aside, the whole university mech team thing isn’t so different from what a few universities back home do with robots.”

Tenir’s head tilted, her horns catching the light. “Robots?”

“Not like this,” he said quickly, gesturing at the towering machines and gigantic stadiums. “They’re much smaller things. Pretty sure it’s a hundred-kilo limit. It started as a gameshow. Mostly dads in their garages. But eventually it got popular enough that a lot of big university’s robotics departments got into it as a way to advertise.”

She nodded, a spark of interest in her eyes. “Dads, huh? That’s definitely a human thing.”

Mark rolled his eyes.

Tenir giggled, before continuing. “That’s not entirely different from how this whole mecha thing started. Krenhiem used to just be a layover fuelling platform. Then some loader mech operators started making their own fun. Their own very dangerous fun. Fun that really should have come to an end when their supervisors found out why there were suddenly so many ‘machine malfunctions’ and ‘workplace accidents’ happening.”

“Instead, they saw an opportunity?” Mark guessed.

The Nighkru nodded smugly. “They saw an opportunity. And now just about every star system worthy of the name has at least one mecha gladiator arena. Of course, they all pale in comparison to the true home of mecha fights.”

Mark nodded absently as the mechs in the arena below clashed again, though this time Larkin’s blue machine landed a surprisingly solid hit – catching her opponent off guard with her suddenly rebooted laser arm.

The sucker punch sent Morel’s mech stumbling.

The crowd went wild at the stunning reversal as Larkin’s claw like foot came up in an incredible show of dexterity to pin Morel’s entire torso against a ruined wall. With her opponents shoulder weapons pinned between her and the wall – and her arm now down and sparking, the blue mech had ample time to bring up her own shoulder weapons and aimed them right at her foe’s torso.

She wouldn’t miss if she fired – and Morel knew it as a moment later the commentator announced the red mech’s surrender.

The crowd erupted once more, and Mark clapped along - but inside he was a little confused.

“She could still have gotten away though? Couldn’t she?” he said over the din – thankfully muffled by the glass of their viewing box. “She’d have taken some bad hits to do so, but she might have been able to recover.”

Tenir nodded slowly. “Maybe. But she’d also have had to eat the repair costs for doing so. And in the lower leagues, it’s sometimes better to lose a match if it means keeping your mech intact. Ignoring the cost, there’s also repair time to consider. From her perspective it must have been better to lose now and be able to attend the next tournament than wreck her mech now and be both unlikely to be able to attend the next match as well as the tournament after.”

Huh, he hadn’t considered that.

“Is that a consideration for Kalia?” he asked as he watched the two mechs disengage from each other, retreating to openings in the arena walls.

Tenir actively laughed, though it sounded a little distracted. “No. Kalia’s sponsors have deep enough pockets that we’ve got a backup mech if her first takes too much damage.”

Huh, he hadn’t fully appreciated what that meant until now. So caught up in his thoughts he was, he actually missed it when Tenir spoke again. Or at least the specifics of what she said.

“Sorry, what was that?” he said, turning his full attention to the Nighkru.

“Oh, I was…” She cleared her throat, her fingers fidgeting with the edge of top. “I was just asking if you would… maybe want to grab something to eat after this? Maybe talk a bit more about… the match?”

Mark blinked, then glanced at the table between them, where a half-eaten spread of various snacks sat. “Didn’t we just eat?”

Tenir’s cheeks darkened, a faint flush spreading across her silver skin. “I mean, maybe a recaf then? Or… something?”

Ah, coffee. Or the alien equivalent.

He grinned.

Well, he supposed he had time. And this new side of Tenir was of great interest to him.

Yeah, she was definitely a very different person ‘off the clock’. And now that she didn’t have the comfort of talking about something she was very familiar with, she seemed to have once more defaulted back to the shy young woman he’d met outside the arena.

The contrast was disarming, and Mark found himself liking it more than he expected.

“Sure,” he said, his grin widening. “A hot drink sounds great. You want to do it at my place or yours?”

He almost felt a little bad for phrasing it that way as the young woman flushed even deeper at the ‘innocent’ turn of phrase.

Again, the key word there was almost.

Not least of all because there was no guarantee at all that anything explicit was going to happen. He still wasn’t entirely decided on the validity of a workplace liaison.

So, he’d enjoy an alien coffee and talk a bit.

That was all.

\-----------------

Kalia was in a good mood as she leaned against a workbench in ‘Saria’s’ mech bay.

It was just her, the Pesrin and the faint hum of diagnostic systems as they worked on getting Starkiller back up to form.

The towering frame of her primary mech loomed overhead next to his brother, the pair’s crimson and black armor gleaming under the hangar lights.

He looked all the more intimidating for the gouges across his armor – a memento of her last match that had yet to be fixed.

Mostly because Saria was, for the moment, more concerned with other more pressing issues. Which was why she was currently perched on a gantry, elbow-deep in Starkillers shoulder joint, muttering curses in Pesrin as she wrestled with something or other.

Kalia considered herself an excellent pilot, but a poor mechanic. She knew a little, but a ‘little’ didn’t count for much where mechs were concerned.

Still, she did have some insight into what the repair process entailed – and what it didn’t.

“I realize I’m the amateur here, and you’re the pro,” the heiress called up to her friend. “But somehow I doubt Starkiller’s servo issue really requires that much percussive maintenance.”

She saw the Pesrin’s ears flick, before she turned to scowl – or perhaps more accurately, pout down at her. “Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe I’m feeling a little frustrated because my best friend screwed me out of a good screwing in favour of a certain silver skinned pain in the ass. And not the fun kind.”

Kalia sighed, rubbing her temple where a headache was brewing. She loved her friends – she really did - but their constant bickering could wear on her.

It didn’t help that they often felt like the two competing halves of her own life. Saria, was the gritty, hands-on world of the arena, and Tenir was the calculated sheen of her family’s corporate empire.

Both were vital, but trying to balance them was like piloting a mech with one arm tied behind her back.

Hell, that would probably be easier!

“Ok, a lot of assumptions on your part there, but I thought you had another guy you were already after? That Shil’vati at the recaf place?” Kalia asked. “The one you wouldn’t shut up about last month?”

Saria’s tail lashed, and she yanked a wrench from her toolkit with more force than necessary. “Yeah, he made it abundantly clear he wasn’t interested.”

Vorn winced. “Ah, rough.”

And it was.

Some guys could be downright ruthless about turning down a girl. Not that Kalia didn’t get why. The fact of the matter was that girls had to be pushy to stand out from the crowd.

A woman that wasn’t pushing for a match wasn’t going to find one.

So guys, in turn, had to be blunt - sometimes cruelly so - to make their refusals known and not just… some kind of test of a girl’s dedication.

Fortunately, Kalia herself tended to be insulated from that kind of rejection as a rule of thumb. As both a celebrity pilot and the heiress to a corporate fortune, her issues with men tended to run in the opposite direction.

Still, she’d watched her friends get burned by dismissive guys often enough to know the game.

“You’re telling me,” Saria snorted, tossing the wrench back into her toolkit with a clang. “And then I came back here to find out that not only did you steal my ‘first date’ plan with the new guy – you gave it to Tenir! Tenir!”

Kalia stared dryly up at her friend. “You’re the one always complaining about Tenir being an uptight pain in the ass. I thought you’d be happy about this. Her finally getting laid might actually help her unwind.”

And as much as she loved Tenir, the fact was that she was only *slightly* exaggerating her motives for setting her manager up for a date with her newest employee.

“Our human might work that ‘human magic’ you’re always going on about on her,” she continued. “Make her relax a little.”

Saria’s ears flattened, and she growled low in her throat. “I’d rather have been irritated by Tenir’s high-strung ass and have the human relieve *me* with his magic dick.”

Kalia scoffed, though a grin tugged at her lips. “Well, you still have a chance. Human or not, she’s hardly likely to get lucky on the first date. He’s still a guy.”

Personally, Kalia thought her friend was reading far too much into hypernet rumors of human promiscuity.

She’d met ‘Mark’ during their brunch earlier and he’d been… surprisingly normal. Professional, but not stiff. Cute, admittedly, in a boyish way. Not that she was particularly interested – she wasn’t some kind of cheater - but she could see why Saria and Tenir were circling.

Saria huffed, but her tail flicked with reluctant amusement. “Well, I can’t argue that her chances of scoring with him – even if he is a human – are pretty much nil. If that stick up her ass doesn’t scare him off, those animations of hers will. He’ll get one look at her apartment and run.”

Kalia didn’t think that likely.

Mostly because she’d advised her friend to… hide her less respected hobby as best she could.

On the off chance those hypernet rumours turned out to be true and she did manage to lure the chef back to her apartment.

Which in and of itself she considered unlikely. Still, it’d be a shame for the evening to be ruined by her date being… put off by the woman’s giant anime posters.

\-------------------

Tenir’s heart sank.

She'd finally managed to get a guy back to her apartment… and her worst fears had been realized.

“Ooh, what’s this?” asked guilelessly as he scooped up a brightly coloured case from her recaf table. “An actual hardcopy of a movie? I didn’t even know people still made hard copies?”

They didn’t – unless they were as a collectible.

Like the one held in his hands, its holographic cover glinting ominously under her apartment’s soft lighting.

Somehow!

Because she thought she’d hidden her anime collection! She’d tucked away the figurines, the posters, the paraphernalia - all to make her sleek, modern apartment look suave, and sophisticated.

Not nerdy.

Like Kalia said! Suave. Like she was at work.

And now, her carefully curated image was crumbling.

Not least of all because the disk he’d picked was ‘*Star Hunks: Galactic Heat*’.

It was one of her more… fanservice heavy titles - skimpy outfits, suggestive scenes, a bunch of guys fighting over one girl, threadbare plot.

He turned to her and said the one thing she didn’t want to hear.

“Could we watch it?”

There were a thousand things she could have said. Excuses. Deflections. Outright lies.

Instead, what slipped out of her mouth was…

“S-sure?”

[Introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/rsforgays/comments/1l5p3f1/giovannis_room_readalong_intro_w_schedule_starts/) | [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/rsforgays/comments/1lads5e/giovannis_room_part_1_chapters_13/)

# Recap

We get vignettes of the moments David and Giovanni spent together in the brief spring blossom and summer end of their relationship. Cute early morning walks along the bank of the Seine. Coffee, cognac, and cigarette chats in Giovanni’s room. Late afternoon naps, washing and shaving together, dancing out into the streets, and dropping off Giovanni at Guillaume’s bar.

David receives mail: one from his father urging him to return home, one from Hella ready to return from Spain and reunite. On his way to break things off with Giovanni, David walks down a street he has been with both Hella and Giovanni and it is Giovanni’s face that glows before him and occupies his mind. Anxious to forget and repress his relationship with Giovanni, David impulsively hooks up with a fellow American girl named Sue. When David returns to Giovanni’s room, he finds Giovanni waiting there for him. Giovanni is in a state of manic rage after being fired, falsely accused, and publicly humiliated by Guillaume. David consoles him and from then on, Giovanni becomes more dependent on David, complicating David’s decision to leave.

# Thoughts

Consistently, David’s self-loathing sours and curdles every single joy in his life. It’s so silly and hilariously sad to me that he was perfectly fine tidying up Giovanni’s room but once he realizes that it’s a “housewife” duty and that men aren’t housewives, he hates it. He’s having these beautiful romantic moments (in Paris!) with Giovanni that make him feel carefree but then they run into another man and it turns into a nightmare for him. He can’t decide if Giovanni’s touch pleases him or repulses him. The shame follows him, even in the privacy of their room.

The room itself is given an interesting characterization. Giovanni’s disorderly room is “not a matter of habit or circumstance or temperament; it was a matter of punishment and grief.” Is this projection from David, assuming Giovanni must be as self-loathing as he is? Or is this Baldwin suggesting that Giovanni is not really as self-accepting and easy-going as he presents? His room is in this condition well before he meets David and well before the fallout with Guillaume, so what is the source of Giovanni's grief? 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

David’s self-loathing also spills out into his treatment of women. For some reason, his hookup with Sue reminded me of Mizoguchi (the incel character from our previous Mishima read). In David’s eyes, Sue isn’t an actual person so much as a *thing* to conquer and reassert his masculinity when he’s feeling impotent. His relationship with Giovanni is an impediment to reuniting with Hella, but cheating on Hella with Sue isn’t a problem?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Last thing: I *still* don’t know what David does for a living. Giovanni is working every evening until dawn at the bar and David’s just kinda… bohemian layabout maxxing and hitting up Jacques again for money (and Jacques gets nothing in return)? David’s dad isn’t particularly wealthy or generous. Didn’t you need a student visa or work visa to be an expat and stay that long in France or was 1950s Paris just laissez-faire like that?

1lgbdws,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1lgbdws/controlled_agency_vs_free_agency/,Controlled Agency vs Free Agency,"I was listening to a podcast from Diary of a CEO on a debate about feminism done with 3 flavors of feminists. They brought up this idea between free and controlled agency which made me think about the Mormon Church. 

The church constantly harped on its gospel allowing members to truly practice their free agency, mostly towards the right way of using it, being in the church. Lately I've heard a lot of conversations on informed consent and how the church didn't inform us. (ex. baptism by 8, temple endowment consent being inside the temple with high social pressures; whether it be leaving at that point of the temple session or preparing for marriage and mission.) So there's really no informed consent being given which means there is no free agency. If we want to be generous with the word agency, controlled agency would be more accurate. ""I'm so happy you chose to be baptized"" ""I'm happy you chose a mission"" ""I'm happy you chose to pay your tithing"" with all these 'blessings' attached. However the only blessing you can see is not being berated by your loved ones for deciding not to going against the grain... I don't recall a single blessing I received. Most of my childhood was clutching to Jesus understanding me, scrupulosity in prayer, guilt of never finishing the BOM, gratitude attitude. Never truly understanding myself or how to make my purpose happen because I was constantly trying to use my free agency the right way. Which commonly was whatever the patriarchs in my life expected. (should've listened to my mom more often).

I wonder if this is why a lot of Mormons/exMormons are people pleasers

Now that I am out I have truly experienced Free Agency. I think.. it's hard to feel like it was a real choice to leave the church when your shelf crashes down. But in other aspects I'm able to make decisions on what I believe, who I want to be, the people I associate with, what food and drinks I eat (mostly referring to coffee, tea and kombucha!), what I wear. And the blessings in using agency in my way has been more obvious. I have people who love and care for me, my confidence is great, my health is improving (garments sucked as a female), I'm not as over stimulated, I spend my Sundays productively more comfortable than being exhausted by church and napping all day or feeling guilty for not listening to/watching church related media, guilt in general is based on true mistakes other than church pressured issues. 

My practice of Free agency has made me feel, well, free. Life isn't perfect but it's significantly better!

TLDR There is no free agency in the church, it is all controlled but in a way that makes it seem like our choice. We do so to save ourselves socially whether we believe it or not.

1lgbbf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lgbbf9/i_think_my_tv_knows_whats_coming/,I think my TV knows what’s coming.,"My evenings are sacred. Six o'clock, Channel 7, local news. It’s been my anchor for years, a predictable hum against the unpredictable world. 

But lately, that hum has been off-key. Dissonant.

It started subtly, maybe two months ago. A curious little segment at the end of the broadcast. The anchor, a perpetually chipper woman named Brenda, reported on a feel-good story out of a small town in Oregon, Seaside. ""Local man, Arthur Jenkins,"" she'd chirped, ""finally reels in the record-breaking salmon he's been chasing for decades, just off the coast."" I remember thinking, Good for Arthur.

The next morning, while scrolling through my phone during my first coffee, a local news alert popped up: ""Seaside Man Shatters Fishing Record."" A photo of a grinning old man holding an impossibly large salmon. Just like Brenda said. I chuckled, figuring it was a slow news day and they’d somehow gotten the jump on the story. A well-placed source, maybe.

A few days later, a less pleasant item on the 6 PM news. Brenda, looking slightly more serious, reported on an unexpected closure of a popular community garden in Boise, Idaho. ""A sudden, widespread blight has swept through the heirloom tomato plants,"" she'd announced, ""devastating the harvest."" I shook my head. Poor gardeners.

The very next day, I found it. My own small balcony herb garden, usually thriving, had several of my tomato plants looking sickly, leaves wilting, black spots spreading with alarming speed. Just my tomatoes, nothing else. I’d never seen anything like it. It was too specific, too sudden. My mind flashed back to the news. A coincidence, I tried to tell myself, just a weird strain of local blight.

The pattern, once you started looking, became undeniable. This was around the time I started keeping a dedicated notebook journal. 

At first, it was just a few scribbled notes, trying to rationalize what I was seeing. Then, as the oddities piled up, it became an obsession. 

One night, the news showed a quick clip of a daring squirrel hoarding an entire five-pound bag of birdseed from a feeder in a suburban yard in upstate New York. The next morning, I stepped onto my porch to find my usually squirrel-proof feeder completely empty, scattered seeds leading a clear trail to a suspiciously plump squirrel eyeing me from a tree branch. My journal entry for that day simply read: Squirrel. Birdseed. Exact match.

Then came the night the news ran a human interest piece on a couple in Texas who'd narrowly escaped a house fire. ""They were sound asleep,"" the reporter recounted, ""when their beloved pet parrot, 'Allen,' began squawking an incoherent warning, waking them just in time."" A heartwarming story.

The next morning, my neighbor's elderly golden retriever, Midas, who rarely made a peep, started barking frantically at 4 AM. Not a normal bark, but a desperate, guttural sound that didn't stop until my neighbor finally got up and found their living room wall outlet sparking, threatening to catch fire. Midas had saved them. My breath caught in my throat. It was too precise. Too… whispered from the screen. My journal entry that night was longer, more frantic. It's showing me tomorrow. Not just random events. Warnings.

My daily routine morphed into a nightly vigil. I’d scribble furiously into my journal as the news played, trying to capture every detail. I’d replay segments in my mind, searching for the premonition, the one detail that would leap out and confirm my growing dread. It wasn't just coincidence. The news wasn't reporting the future. It was somehow... pre-living it.

Last night, Brenda's face was grim. The lead story: a bizarre, cascading collapse of communication networks. ""A sudden, widespread silence has fallen across swaths of the Midwest,"" she reported, her voice hushed, ""attributed to an unknown atmospheric resonance detected deep within the troposphere."" My blood ran cold. This wasn't a local garden or a brave pet. This was immense.

And then, the ""And Finally..."" segment began. 

But there was no cheerful segue. Brenda looked directly into the camera, her eyes wide with a terror that finally broke through her practiced poise. ""And finally,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible, ""Reports are coming in from deep-space observatories. What was initially dismissed as lens flare or equipment malfunction is being confirmed across multiple independent arrays now. 

An unknown object. Asteroid 'Charon's Scythe,' as it's been tentatively designated. 

It was initially tracked, harmlessly, within the heart of the main asteroid belt, a stable presence among millions. 

But it appears to be… wavering off course.""

We bow down to your superhuman skill in sifting through résumés, each one a thrilling testament to human aspiration, only to pluck out the one true gem that perfectly fits the meticulously crafted, yet often vague, job description.

We adore your insightful phone calls, where you expertly rehash every bullet point we've already meticulously detailed on our LinkedIn profiles. It's truly a masterclass in efficiency, ensuring no vital piece of information goes unrepeated. And let's not forget the thrilling suspense of the ""ghosting"" phenomenon—a subtle art form you've perfected, leaving us mere plebeians to wonder if our application vanished into the ether or if you simply found someone with a more impressive collection of artisanal coffee mugs.

Your dedication to ""synergy"" and ""leveraging core competencies"" truly inspires us all. We marvel at your ability to translate the convoluted demands of corporate speak into something that almost, *almost*, sounds like a coherent job role. And when you finally bless us with an interview, it's a sheer delight to discover that the ""exciting new opportunity"" you promised is actually just the same old grind, but with a slightly different title and perhaps a few more pointless meetings.

So raise a glass, everyone, to the unsung heroes of hiring! To the gatekeepers, the matchmakers, the purveyors of vague promises and endless email chains! Without you, dear recruiters, the world would undoubtedly devolve into utter chaos, and we'd all be forced to find jobs through some primitive, inefficient method... like, you know, directly applying to companies. Perish the thought!

Anyways, howdy! I’m looking to hopefully make a connection that leads to some romance! Posting on Reddit AGAIN (dating apps are killing me sos) as I’ve met some great folks on here and I’m still hoping to find someone who matches my energy! 😂

A lil about me, I am a cis lady, from Canada. I am pretty femme, and I’d say I have a very cute, comfortable/casual style. I do want to get a few more tattoos in the future as well! I am about 5’5ish, average size ish (A lil chubby, but not plus size.), dark brunette and have dark brown eyes. In terms of like actual hobbies I do spend most of my free time doing fibre crafts. I do love napping when I can, I do smoke sometimes, I also enjoy doing my makeup and tweaking my skincare routine, and self care (does this count as a hobby lol?) I love going for walks with my music blasting, and hiking when I have the time, love me some cute coffee dates and I do game sometimes on my switch. I also love dogs, if you have one send pics PLZ. I have an alright job, a few close friends and a boring life so overall my life is pretty quiet and drama free! Really just looking to share in the monotony of day to day life with someone, the highs and lows and whatever falls between those places too. 😊

Im not really dead set on someone particular or a “type” I’m looking for, I’m very chatty and am hoping you are too though! I’d love to hear about your day everyday, your hobbies, yours passions and everything else going on! Also please have a good sense of humour! I would prefer if you were close ish to my age or a bit older (24+), and preferably from Canada or North America? I can’t do huge time zone differences, I sleep too much! 😂 I am also monogamous relationship wise, very on the fence about kids, and want to be around people who share the same values (Politically left and an atheist.) Also happy to swap selfies if you wanna see who you’re talking to! 

Please if you do reach out, please tell me your age, where you’re from and a little blurb about you so we can get to chitty chatting! Thanks for reading lmao!

1lgb9vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/1lgb9vy/s1_liveaction_life_is_strange_where_max_wont_shut/,[S1] Live-action Life is Strange where Max won’t shut up about cameras and steals Chloe’s bacon.,"Been toying with the idea of a Life is Strange live-action series where the characters get a little more room to breathe, and their quirks shine through in small, authentic moments.

I always headcanoned Max as having ADHD (the IEP note in the game, the way her inner monologue hops around), and also thought it'd be funny if she had this totally disproportionate appetite. Chloe would never let her hear the end of it.

I wrote two little scenes imagining those details in a show format. Hope you enjoy — and would love to hear if you have other character quirks you'd add if you were in the writer’s room.

**Camera Geek-Out Scene**

**INT. MAX'S DORM ROOM - AFTERNOON**

*CHLOE sits at Max's desk, casually browsing on her laptop. Multiple browser tabs are open - social media, music sites, and what appears to be photography equipment websites. MAX is across the room, organizing photos on her bed.*

**CHLOE:** (scrolling) Jesus, Max, how many camera websites do you have bookmarked? It's like... *counting* ...twelve tabs of just lens porn.

**MAX:** (not looking up) That's not porn, Chloe. That's B&H Photo.

**CHLOE:** (clicking on one of the tabs) Same difference. Holy shit, this thing costs more than my mom's car. *squints at screen* What the hell is a... ""Leica M11 Monochrom""?

*MAX's head snaps up like a meerkat. Her eyes light up with the intensity of a thousand suns.*

**MAX:** (dropping her photos, rushing over) Oh my GOD, you clicked on the M11 Mono?! Chloe, that's not just a camera, that's like... okay, so you know how most digital cameras have color filters over each pixel to capture RGB data, right? Well, the Monochrom strips all that away - it's a dedicated black and white sensor, which means each pixel gets the full light information instead of being divided into color channels, so the resolution is effectively tripled and the ISO performance is absolutely insane, we're talking like 100,000 ISO with barely any noise, and the dynamic range is just—

**CHLOE:** (staring at Max with growing amusement) Uh-huh...

**MAX:** (getting more animated, talking faster) —and the build quality is just ridiculous, like it's basically a piece of German engineering porn, hand-assembled, and the rangefinder mechanism is so precise it's like butter, and don't even get me started on the Summilux lenses, the bokeh is just *chef's kiss* perfect, and—

**CHLOE:** (grinning)

**MAX:** (completely oblivious, pacing now) —plus the film simulation modes are incredible, you can get that classic Tri-X look or go full Ansel Adams with the zone system mapping, and the viewfinder has these frame lines that automatically adjust based on the lens you're using, which is just... it's like having a crystal ball for composition, and the shutter is so quiet you could use it in a library, and—

**CHLOE:** MAX!

**MAX:** (mid-sentence, blinking rapidly) What?!

**CHLOE:** (laughing) Shut the fuck up.

**MAX:** (deflating slightly, hurt) Ouch.

**CHLOE:** (softening, but still grinning) I mean... Jesus, Max. You literally just talked for like three minutes straight without breathing. I thought you were gonna pass out.

**MAX:** (sheepish, fidgeting with her camera strap) Sorry. I get a little... enthusiastic.

**CHLOE:** A little? You went full Rain Man on me. (pauses, then grins) It's actually kind of adorable.

**MAX:** (small smile) Thanks... I think?

**CHLOE:** (looking at the laptop screen) Okay, but seriously - twenty-seven thousand dollars for a camera that only takes black and white photos? That's insane.

**MAX:** (perking up again) Well, actually, when you consider the technological innovation required to—

**CHLOE:** (holding up a hand) Nope. We're done. Camera talk is over.

**MAX:** (grinning) Fine. But just so you know, that's not even the expensive one.

**CHLOE:** (horrified) There's a MORE expensive one?

**MAX:** (mischievous smile) Want to see?

**CHLOE:** (closing the laptop) Hell no! Down, Max. Down! We're going to get waffles instead.

**MAX:** (grabbing her jacket) Can I bring my camera?

**CHLOE:** (deadpan) Do you ever NOT bring your camera?

**MAX:** (considering this seriously) ...No. Not really.

*They head for the door, MAX automatically checking her camera bag.*

**CHLOE:** (as they exit) You know what? Next time I use your laptop, I'm putting parental controls on those photography sites.

**MAX:** (mock horror) You wouldn't dare!

**CHLOE:** (grinning) Try me, Ansel Adams.

*They exit, their voices fading down the hallway.*

**Breakfast Marathon Scene**

**INT. PRICE KITCHEN - MORNING**

*The kitchen is warm and inviting, filled with the smell of bacon and coffee. JOYCE is at the stove, humming softly as she tends to a pan of scrambled eggs. MAX sits at the table, already working her way through a plate of toast, occasionally reaching for pieces of fruit from a bowl in the center.*

**JOYCE:** (over her shoulder) More coffee, Max?

**MAX:** (mouth half-full) Yes, please. This is amazing, Joyce.

*MAX takes a sip of coffee while simultaneously grabbing a piece of bacon from a platter. She's eating with the focused efficiency of someone who's genuinely hungry.*

*CHLOE appears at the bottom of the stairs, hair tousled, wearing an oversized band t-shirt. She shuffles into the kitchen, still half-asleep.*

**CHLOE:** (yawning) Morning, losers.

**JOYCE:** (kissing Chloe's forehead) Good morning, sunshine. There's fresh coffee.

**CHLOE:** (slumping into a chair across from Max) Thanks, mom. (notices Max's plate) Jesus, Max, did you sleep at all or just eat all night?

**MAX:** (reaching for a piece of cantaloupe) I slept great, actually. Your bed is way more comfortable than my dorm's.

*JOYCE places a plate of eggs and bacon in front of Chloe, then adds more to Max's already substantial spread.*

**JOYCE:** I made extra. Figured you girls would be hungry.

**MAX:** (brightening) Thank you so much!

*As they talk, MAX continues eating - she finishes her toast, moves on to the eggs, grabs another piece of bacon, takes a bite of cantaloupe, then reaches for a muffin from a basket near the window.*

**CHLOE:** (sipping coffee, watching Max absently) So I was thinking we could hit up the thrift stores today, maybe check out that new record shop on—

*She pauses mid-sentence, finally registering what she's seeing. MAX has somehow managed to clear most of her original plate and is now working on the muffin while eyeing the remaining bacon.*

**CHLOE:** (incredulous) Dude... are you ever gonna stop eating? Like, you already ate breakfast for what I eat in three days.

**MAX:** (looking up, slightly defensive) I have a big appetite.

**CHLOE:** (leaning back in her chair, gesturing at Max) How can you even fit that much stuff in such a tiny body?

*MAX's expression shifts, becoming mock-threatening. She sets down her muffin and leans forward.*

**MAX:** Call me tiny again, and I'll smash this table with you.

**CHLOE:** (raising an eyebrow, voice dropping to a sultry tone) Damn, girl. You're hardcore.

**MAX:** (rolling her eyes) Ha-ha.

*JOYCE watches this exchange with amused fondness, refilling both their coffee cups.*

**JOYCE:** (to Chloe) This reminds me of you when you were younger. You used to eat us out of house and home during growth spurts.

**CHLOE:** (mock horror) Mom! Don't compare me to the human garbage disposal over there.

**MAX:** (reaching for another piece of bacon) Hey, I'm a growing artist. I need fuel for my creative process.

**CHLOE:** (deadpan) What are you growing? A second stomach?

**MAX:** (taking a bite of bacon) Maybe. It would be efficient.

*JOYCE laughs, ruffling Max's hair as she passes.*

**JOYCE:** I like this one, Chloe. She appreciates good food.

**MAX:** (beaming) See? Your mom gets it.

**CHLOE:** (shaking her head, but smiling) You're both insane. (pauses) But seriously, where does it all go? It's like you have a black hole for a digestive system.

**MAX:** (shrugging, reaching for the jam) Fast metabolism, I guess. Plus all that running around taking photos burns calories.

**CHLOE:** (sarcastically) Right. All that vigorous... standing and clicking.

**MAX:** (grinning) Hey, carrying camera equipment is basically weight training.

*She demonstrates by hefting an imaginary heavy camera, nearly knocking over the orange juice in the process.*

**JOYCE:** (laughing) Alright, you two. Finish up so I can clean the kitchen before work.

**CHLOE:** (standing, grabbing her half-eaten plate) I'm done. Unlike some people, I know when to stop.

**MAX:** (looking at the remaining food on the table) Are you sure you're done with that bacon?

**CHLOE:** (exasperated) Oh my god, Max! Yes, take the bacon!

*MAX grins triumphantly, reaching for Chloe's leftover strips.*

**JOYCE:** (to Max) You're welcome here anytime, sweetheart. It's nice to see someone who appreciates a good meal.

**MAX:** (mouth full of bacon) Thanks, Joyce. This was amazing.

**CHLOE:** (from the doorway) Come on, human vacuum. Let's go before you eat the table too.

**MAX:** (standing, patting her stomach contentedly) That's not a bad idea, actually. What kind of wood is this?

**CHLOE:** (groaning) I'm leaving without you!

*MAX laughs, grabbing one more piece of fruit as she follows Chloe out of the kitchen.*",1,1750444005.0,lifeisstrange,0,0.53,False

1lgb99n,https://www.reddit.com/r/wafflehouse/comments/1lgb99n/help_me_survive/,Help me survive,"I'm a new waitress at waffle house and new to being a waitress in general. I'm on the younger and haven't had jobs similar to waiting. I've worked at a doggy daycare and dog boarding centers, so I'm used to working with pet owners which are a whole different breed of people. 

I've gotten past training and feel as if I am slowly getting a hang of the job, however, it is very stressful and I am taking a bit longer to adapt to that stress than I thought. I've been getting discouraged. Recently, my mother called me up and said one of her coworkers was a customer of mine and complained about their horrible experience they had with me as their waitress. While they were eating, I remember the wife yelling loudly things like ""this shit is ridiculous"" I did my brst to reassure them things would be on the way as soon as possible. They complained their food was cold, that I brought their drinks late and that I was unattendent to their needs. I had serveral other customers at the time, and even one who directly went behind the counter to ask for more coffee. (I try and go around to do fill ups as soon as I can, but that day I was getting pulled in every direction.) I feel terrible and feel like the progress I thought I was making was non-existant. 

We had a new trainee on grill which slowed us down during our breakfast rush but was new, just like me, so I gave him as much slack as I could. We also had a trainee behind the counter, who was doing the best she could as well. I also felt as if my other coworkers were not allowing me to call in my orders, putting their own table's order first. (If that makes sense.)

My final question is, how can I deal with negative comments such as these? Anyone have tips and tricks to get one through the day? How do I become a better waitress on the busiest of days? While this isn't the first person who has been rude to me, it is one that sticks with me. I don't want to be the person that pushes the accountability on others but there is only so much I can do at once. And I can only give one their food when its cooked.

Anything would be helpful. I know waffle house isn't the place to work for everyone, but there are very few jobs in my area. I want to do the best I possibly can and provide the best service possible.",1,1750443963.0,wafflehouse,3,1.0,False

So we upgraded our coffee bar in our kitchen/living room/dining room to built-in cabinets. I'm trying to figure out the best option for the backsplash. There isn't really any water concern since there is no water line, this would mainly be for aesthetics.

I could leave it without anything, add more trim like in other areas of the room (in the other photos), add a wallpaper backsplash, add trim and wallpaper (wallpaper would go in all of the boxes/frames in the space), or add tile.

Tile would probably look the most finished but I want it to look cohesive with the kitchen (in the other photos) without being too overwhelming since it's not a large room. Currently the pulls, door styles, and counter are the same. I could use the same white tile or go for something different. I found a similar shaped tile in a matching green to the cabinet (looks gray in the picture) that I thought would might look nice. But I'm also at a loss of where to end the tile backsplash.

Any thoughts or recommendations would be much appreciated!",1,1750443821.0,InteriorDesign,1,1.0,False

Update- thanks for all your reponses. I  realized I wouldn’t have asked if I felt right about the business. 

It’s a snow cone/ coffee shop. It’s the snow cone part I’m interested in but of it’s the coffee part that makes income during the fall and winter. 

I will pass on the opportunity. ",6,1750443524.0,lds,11,0.88,False

1lgb0b7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lgb0b7,July 1st sublet available in Ridgewood 2BR w/ new 1yr lease available for September 1st,"Hi all! I’m looking for someone to take over a room in north Ridgewood for July and August. Room is available starting July 1st. The apartment is three-bedroom being used as a two-bedroom. One bathroom. Rent for the room for July/August is $1175/month. You would also pay internet ($40/month) and electric (\~$60/month on average but also: summer is here.)

I’ve been living in this unit since 2021, I find it super comfortable and I love the location. Hopefully you will find the same! Room is available on a permanent basis starting September 1st with a small rent increase; happy to provide more details on this via DM.

About the apartment:

* 10min walk from Seneca Av M, 15min walk from DeKalb L, easy access to Q54 and B38 buses
* Nice selection of coffee and lunch spots in vicinity (come eat Salty Lunch Lady whenever you want), a few grocery store options. Quick walk to Jefferson St area for nightlife with other parts of Ridgewood at your fingertips
* Has a deeply overgrown backyard lol. Pretty much not usable currently but landlord says do whatever you want, could be a dream for someone who loves landscaping…?
* Extra, non-occupied bedroom used as storage / guest room for out-of-town friends
* Bedrooms on opposite ends, good privacy
* Well-equipped kitchen
* Building is pet friendly and so am I
* Free window AC if you need it

About me:

* 33M, gay, works in the humanities
* Takes good care of common spaces, expecting the same
* Mostly a “lemme take an edible and play video games” kind of guy, keep to myself most of the time  

About you:

* Generally chill, gay friendly, able to pay and ready to move in!",9,1750443334.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False
