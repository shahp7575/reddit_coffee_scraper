1iwtc8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1iwtc8d/arguments_leading_to_thoughts_i_dislike/,Arguments leading to thoughts I dislike,"

I don’t really know where to start. My girlfriend (20f) and me (22m) have been pretty much fighting everytime we call. We’re long distance and I constantly am getting upset at her behaviors. Yesterday she (while on call with me) randomly got approached by some stranger (some random guy at her uni) crying about his breakup and said he needed someone to talk to. She for some reason thought the best course of action was to just cut the call with me without telling me anything and then just disappeared for around an hour. Came back and started telling me what happened because I asked. Midway through her explanation I asked her if she believed that the best thing she could have done was cut me off when some dude comes to talk to her. She says no and apologized, etc. we continue fighting and she said she believed it required more urgency than our call and so she did it. 

I mean sure? But why did she have to cut me? Like this is some random dude (allegedly). This isn’t the first time she’s abandoned me for someone. I’m constantly being put second. I didn’t get anything for valentines either and it’s because “it didn’t get to me in time so I couldn’t”. She said she’s bringing me one when she flies down. 

I’m just tired of being someone who puts in so much effort for her. I drop everyone for her. She knows she has me completely wrapped around her finger. But she would never do that for me. Even a random stranger takes priority over me. She evaluates everyone’s feelings except mine before doing anything. 

It’s gotten to a point that I’m so insecure, that I feel on edge all the time. 

I want to feel wanted. I can’t tell if she finds me attractive or not. I’ve lost so much weight and worked so much on my physical, I’ve refined myself. I’m in college for Biomedical sciences and I’m going into research after this semester. 

My need for feeling wanted has made me decide to go look for it somewhere else. I went out for a coffee with a classmate who has a boyfriend. But at least she appreciates me. At least she acts like it. I don’t know. I’m losing my mind. She’s good in every way except the fact that she makes me feel like she puts everyone except me on a pedestal. 

Maybe it’s because she knows I love her; that she no longer has to put in effort. She has me already and that’s the end. 

AND before anyone says anything. yes. I have spoken to her about it. I actually spoke about it a lot with her but it seems to only get better for a few days and then it’s back to another new method for the lady to make me feel shit.

I feel repulsed. I don’t feel as attracted anymore and I almost never feel the mood to compliment. She’s reinforcing that because everytime I’m like that. She turns into the most loving amazing girlfriend ever. 

Only then though.

I’m pathetic. I don’t know what to do

TL;DR

Girlfriend shows priority to other people constantly, making me more and more insecure. I’ve started seeking attention from others and feel horrendous.

1iwt9zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1iwt9zs/ai_art_is_depressing_me_and_why/,AI art is depressing me (and why),"i just need to get this out, ive been sick to my stomach for about an hour. art has, for my entire life, been my escape. i do it for fun, i would love to do it for work, but i accepted a while ago that thats not really sustainable. AI has always bothered me, but right now i feel completely crushed. its everywhere i go, ive recently been playing minecraft to de-stress and when trying to look up inspiration photos i was met with either AI builds or ai pictures of real buildings i would have used for inspo. from there i spiraled. to me it seems cruel.

for me, ai art is explicitly anti art. it was marketed originally as a way to cut us out of the picture entirely, and actively discouraged people from trying to create or understand pieces. it places value on aesthetics over integrity or intent. for me, part of why i enjoy art is improving, being able to say i came this far and bonding with other people over that and getting to see their stories through their OWN work. some may say this is gatekeeping, but i dont expect anyone to be at the same level i am! in fact i love showing support to beginner artists! there are so many platforms where id scroll until i saw something fun or abstract or “unpolished/amateur”, and id show them support because i think its cool or cute or just actually good. in the past 3 months i’ve had to unfollow so many because they just. gave up. i couldnt SEE them anymore. only a mash of different pieces from a bunch of different artists. some i could admire, some i could know, i might even be one of them. in fact as ive scrolled through AI support spaces a lot of people have been saying that nobody is FORCING you to use ai. which is true. but they certainly love to show it everywhere. google images. pinterest, instagram, facebook, deviantart, tumblr etc. these places are filled to the brim with AI ads, posts, etc. even google images. and thats not even touching on the videos and images. what these people fail to realize is that in order to get the “art” they gain from their prompts, they are stepping over all the artists, photographers, etc. that put hours into their craft only to have it stolen. hundreds of them, many of which dont even know. to generate a piece is to directly say “YOU DONT MATTER.” 

another argument is that if someone is better than you, you dont stop doing something. but that misses the point. ive seen people on pro AI subs grab peoples art from art subreddits, say its ugly and then commend their peers when they generate altered versions of it and how much better they like it now that its cleaner. thats not an exaggeration!! there was a filter going aroynd that, under the guise of being a TDI filter, targeted and stole the art of JUST one person. and millions of people did it. their work, their influences, their credit, their story, completely obscured. and some people thought they did it themselves! that the person who would post their filtered pictures made that art! it took months to figure out who it was stealing from!

a staggering amount of neurodivergent/disabled artists use ai too, and as one myself, this breaks my heart. i know the process can be disheartening, but if i lost my ability to draw due to an injury, condition, etc and someone offered me ai instead, i would do everything in my power to hurt them. it breaks my heart. they deserve so much better than to think the only chance they have at creating something meaningful or beautiful. so much of it comes from insecurity. insecurity for those unseen and unrepresented (a lot of people use it for pfp for example). insecurity that their peers use against them by belitting those who try. its upsetting. in reality you can fo anything! draw in the sand, spit at a canvas, spill coffee on a paper, throw your shit at a wall, it doesnt matter!! (obviously hyperbole but hey 🤷🏽‍♀️) its proof that someone LIVED, somebody FELT, somebody was alive! and that in itself is beautiful enough!! i just font get why that isnt enouugh for them!  even in minority communities like mine, instead of supporting people who want to show our stories they steal from them to make an imitation and parade it as if theyre doing a service. i KNOW everyday people just like me use and support it and thats what makes me so sad. i think its MORE gatekeepy to promote ai imo.

its so disheartening to know that people dont understand that and i cant stop hurting no matter how silly it is. that no matter what i do i cant escape the machine, snd eventually itll consume so much work from those i admire that i cant differentiate what i love from what i hate, whats real and whats fake, etc.  and although not all of them thibk this, so many would much rather have artists gone so that they can generate what they think is right, perfect or beautiful. and THATS what demotivates me. i still want to create but i dont know how much longer i csn. they dont view it that way but it really is cruel, and once i lose this i dont know what to do. i know that even if i sound hysterical what i feel is real. i dont want to give up because thats what they want but i cant keep going.

The Enchanted Knight and Raging Wolf classes can be modded, but there are texture issues that cause visual inconsistencies. I tested this theory on versions 1.xx and beyond, and only a rare few versions worked properly.

[both raging wolf class and enchanted knight  is not out from closed network. after 1.15 - 1.20 patch they become armor set rather then a class it replaced by Warrior and Wretch class.](https://preview.redd.it/fbs8h9w7f0le1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29f69ca54e34c63e4910b6465e887228095ad154)

If you plan to use the DLC *Shadow of the Erdtree* and *Night Reign* in future releases, you can use the 1.10 patch, but you'll miss out on the features introduced in version 1.21. As of now, patches 1.19 and 1.2x do not include any extra items.

[this only work with base game, if you struggle with dlc there's a fork  for it. you just need to google around](https://preview.redd.it/ljrl8ssvg0le1.png?width=313&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6770a4f244cdfb993613ac92dafd69eb23f95a0)

  
After rigorous testing, countless sleepless nights, and more coffee than I can count, I can finally conclude my research. Most mods on Nexus for PC are usable, but if you're dealing with anything related to DCX or texturing, there are challenges. For save-editing mods, version 1.10 is the best choice. However, Nexus save editing requires extraction via Apollo Save Tool if you don't have Save Wizard—just rename the files to .txt.

If you're using version 1.10, you must uninstall the DLC first or install only the base game and patch before the DLC, then proceed with editing your save files.

The only way to confirm that your work is applied to the latest AFR folder is by using FileZilla. Simply download a menu mod that replaces textures—if the texture appears stretched, it means the AFR plugin is working for that specific version.

As for the 60 FPS mod on PC, avoid using it directly. Instead, extract the eboot file and follow the Illusion Patch guide for hex editing. Set the resolution to 720p, and you’ll be good to go.",1,1740369967.0,ps4piracy,0,1.0,False

1iwt6rk,https://www.reddit.com/r/queenstreetbets/comments/1iwt6rk/the_ryman_way_of_life_rym/,The “Ryman Way of Life” [RYM],"Anyone else laughing at Ryman requesting another round of private investment to “Create a Sustainable Capital Structure”? This is following their “Reset” of their Capital Structure 2 years, 9 days ago. Also funded by investors, almost like their business plan is unsustainable. 

How do they think that anyone that was burnt by them diluting their stocks in 2023 would happily invest in a company that requires investors to pay off their debt? Their financial statements are a joke, even with only a quick glance. 

“Ryman’s forecasting that after this its net debt will be $2.25 billion, down from $3 billion…
The steps announced today will mean we are well capitalised as we seek to meet increased demand for the Ryman way of life, while also increasing cash flow generation and shareholder returns…
Ryman had negotiated amendments to borrowing covenants up to and including September 2025.”

Whoops that was the statement from 2023, my bad. Silly me for doing due diligence, having several tabs open and forgetting they had done this before. How about this one?
“Ryman says the move will reduce net interest-bearing debt from $2.56 billion to $1.59 billion… 
Ryman is taking decisive action to reset its balance sheet through a $1.0 billion equity raise to create a sustainable capital structure. This will enhance financial stability and resilience in the current market, and provide the platform to achieve improved performance and a return to growth over time,” the company said.”

I suppose we should be grateful they’re not saying that they “currently intends to resume dividends in 2024.” It does make me curious though, is the “Ryman Way of Life” burning those foolish enough to bail them out of debt or just racking up an unsustainable amount of debt? If so, I think I knew a few homeless people that were in the “Ryman way of Life.”

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, Sevilla vs. Mallorca, the clash of the titans... if by titans you mean two teams trying to remember what winning consistently feels like. Sevilla, sitting comfortably in the middle of the table like a lukewarm cup of coffee, is hoping to make a statement. Unfortunately, that statement has often been, ""Oops, we did it again,"" but not in the Britney Spears way.

Mallorca, meanwhile, has been on a rollercoaster ride this season, and not the fun kind with loops and thrills, but more like the kiddie coaster that just goes in circles. They’ve had a decent start but seem to have misplaced their mojo somewhere between Barcelona and Almeria.

The bookmakers are giving Sevilla the edge, with odds around 2.0, but let's not forget that underdogs in soccer have a knack for surprising us about 41% of the time. Mallorca's odds are floating around 4.0, which is tempting if you're feeling lucky or just enjoy living on the edge.

Given both teams' recent form and the fact that they seem to enjoy close encounters of the soccer kind, betting on the total number of goals being over 2.0 at odds of 1.89 seems like the safest bet. After all, both teams have been known to leak goals like a sieve, and who doesn't love a good goal-fest?

So, grab your popcorn, place your bets, and prepare for a match that could either be a thrilling display of football or a comedy of errors. Either way, it's bound to be entertaining!",1,1740369506.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

I'm new here but wanted to ask the sub some questions and get some opinions. I'm a big fan of espresso, and a big fan of experimenting/working on my espresso. I use a flair 58 and record detailed notes/data of (almost) every shot I pull. I enjoy the process and trying to fine tune details which is why I think I may enjoy roasting. 

I currently live in Boston but am likely going to be moving to a very rural location soon which may have no nearby place to purchase beans. My understanding is that green coffee beans last much longer than roasted beans, so my idea was to buy a large batch of green beans before going, and then I can roast my own beans while out there. This would not only be a fun hobby for me but may help alleviate the issue of no nearby coffee roasters. 

My questions are as follows: does this plan make sense to you all? Do green beans truly store so much better then already roasted? And what setup would you all recommend? I would ideally spend closer to 200 but could theoretically go a bit above.

1iwt0nb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1iwt0nb/should_i_give_him_another_chance/,Should I give him another chance?,"38F and I really like to take things slow when getting to know someone. I’m on dating apps and will actually meet up with men and make an effort as I’m intentional about finding a partner.

Prior to the first date, I like to get to know the person a bit, maybe texting a couple days, and also so I can inform them of my boundaries, which are clearly very different from todays market (so I’m told).

I don’t like much touching on the first few dates, definitely don’t like to kiss, as it makes me feel very uncomfortable to do this with a stranger. (Also I done requires expensive dates, coffee, walk in park, whatever)

I tell men this, every time, and 8 out of 10 times, no exaggeration, they cross the line sometimes in a major way like IMMEDIATELY trying to kiss my neck upon first meeting up (this happened twice on a first date with 2 different men in last month!)

One in particular kept trying to hold my hand (I know not a big deal but I’m just not a touchy person esp 20 min into meeting up for the first time), was a bit touchy in this way throughout, and tried to kiss me twice even after the first time I said to stop. Overall he is a nice guy and I think was just excited because we do have a lot in common and he’s very attracted to me (his words).

The problem is, after the date I was giving him feedback and let him know how uncomfortable I was that he tried to cross my boundary and reiterated that I need to move very slow. He said he “needs to able to move at his pace, including touch” and  that I was “controlling” for creating the boundary that he had to follow. Mind you, this is a boundary about my body.

I realize he was feeling very rejected, and that he responded in a way that he says isn’t aligned with his personality. He’s generally well spoken, hard working, and kind (or so this is my impression).

After I told him I didn’t want to see him again bc of the way he responded to my feedback (which I delivered very kindly) he’s profusely apologized, and is nearly begging for another chance saying he realizes how wrong he was and respects that I have these boundaries and that he’s just not used to it and he would do anything for a second chance as he sees my value.

I don’t know what to do. A part of me feels like he has poor conflict resolution skills and lacks self discipline, the other part realizes I know my boundary is very different from typical standards and he’s very attracted to me and we have a lot in common and he was excited.

As a man, do you think is something I should forgive and move on? Or is this a big red flag that will turn into something bigger?

I (f24) cannot stand when my boyfriend (m24) interacts with women in any way. I don’t think he is cheating on me. But even the idea of him feeling nervous, excited, good about himself, flattered because of another woman makes me so vicious. i don’t like when he goes out, i don’t like if he has women friends, i don’t like him holding doors for women or anything like that. 

I think we have always lived in a society that allowed and enabled men to “soft cheat” on their partners. sure, he can go out and be checking out girls and talking to them, but as long as they don’t kiss or go anywhere further it’s fine. sure, he can go to a coffee shop and have a chat with the barista, a chat that gives him butterflies and makes him feel good about himself, then go home like nothing happened. sure, he can like photos of women online, but he’s not physically doing anything so it’s fine. not to mention the normalization of “work wives.” THIS MENTALITY DRIVES ME CRAZY. i am 1000% uncomfortable with these types of interactions. i hate how normalized they are. i hate that people try to make me seem crazy for being bothered by them. so, i have two options
1.) let him have these little moments of soft cheating- i think this is what majority of women today opt for. they don’t wanna seem like the crazy girlfriend, maybe they’re oblivious to what their partner is getting out of these seemingly innocent interactions. is this the best it’s gonna get? should i just let him go out there and have women make him feel nervous, good about himself, excited????? should i let him hold the door for a random woman and get butterflies because of the cute smile she shoots him? and just act like it doesn’t bother me?

2.) find a man that is ok with giving up women friends, going out, being overly chatty to random women in general. OR find a man that doesn’t see value in those things. does that exist? is there men who don’t WANT to soft cheat, that don’t feel anything when they interact with a pretty girl?

Since then, she has been unable to eat most foods. She struggles with constant terrible reflux and coughing. She can only eat chicken and a few other foods. She has cut out all coffee, soda, etc. She is miserable and receives no relief from Prilosec or Nexium. The doctor has played with the dosage but she’s had no change.

She also takes gabapentin 2x daily but was taking it 3x daily before the illness. She also takes a

1iwsfkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1iwsfkf/i_developed_an_immediate_parasocial_relationship/,I developed an immediate parasocial relationship and felt the strongest love at first site in my life with an Instagram model and it hurts me that I will never be with her. Is it bad that I'm using this infatuation as motivation to fix my life and do normal social/academic activities?,"I'm 19, I wouldn't say I have a porn/masturbation addiction because I do it not for the sense of lust but as an outlet for artificial intimacy and quitting would just make that pain of having no intimacy or love from anybody in my life more crushing.

I masturbate on average every 2-3 days to softcore content like Instagram/onlyfans models and almost every time I do it, I do it to some new girl I've never seen before and never developed real feelings or some major attraction.



What I don't get is that 2 days ago while doing this, I found a particular girl that literally infatuated me at first sight, I thought I knew what having a crush/falling in love felt like but this feels more stronger than anything I've ever felt before towards any girl in my entire life. I feel high on love, my heart's been beating the entire day whenever I think of her.

I think the reason I'm so infatuated with her isn't just because of her looks and body but also because she's from my home country so there's some emotional attachment that makes her feel more real, as well as her mannerisms and outfits being exactly what I vision in my fantasies and dreams of intimacy.



Something about her in her photos having fun on the beach, working out at the gym, and attending concerts awoke in me a crushing realization that I'm doing nothing with my life and wasting my youth instead of doing these things too. I saw a photo of her driving a motorcycle and for the first time in my life I wanted to drive one too now, she made me feel brave, before I had no interest in driving a motorcycle and thought it was dangerous but now I thought if she can, I will.

I saw a photo of her skiing and it broke my heart realizing I missed out on this fun experience as a child and never felt interest in taking risks and living life because my overprotective mother failed to allow me to ever do these fun activities as a kid and I felt a sudden anger and indignation at my mother for it.

Now I want to go skiing. I want to stop living in my house all day and go out and have fun too. I want to feel love too. I want to and deserve to feel wanted  and loved and cared for. I want to enjoy my life and do something meaningful and stop being sheltered and depressed while everybody else my age is having fun.



There's also a crushing feeling of envy/reality kicking in realizing that I will never be with her, live in the same country as her, or take her virginity. God I feel so fucking lonely, no girl will ever make me feel like this but her.

The both positive and negative effect is that she made me feel something and have motivation for the first time in a long time.



For the last year and a half after finishing highschool I've been a NEET and desperate to go back in university but I have severe OCD, and executive dysfunction. This makes reading and consistently doing hard work require extreme willpower, emotional management, and discipline to get through the day which I couldn't do since leaving highschool, even in highschool I barely passed the last semester.

I probably also have undiagnosed depression that I can't notice besides feeling a lot more emotionally numb and tired all day and 2 days ago I felt something strong for the first time in a long time.

I realize that in university you have to do hard work for 8 hours a day to not fall behind. Most days I try I can only handle 30 minutes max of hard work in the entire day. Today for the first time, I did 2 hours of hard work which still isn't nearly as much as needed but it's 4 times higher than anything I've ever managed in the last 19 months.



Yesterday, I was able to do this because I used my infatuation with her/fantasizing of being with her as motivation to work hard, and it worked. I drank the same amount of coffee as yesterday but this combined with the infatuation made my heart feel like it was beating out of its chest.



I went outside by myself (I only leave the house when I'm forced to go shopping/to the doctor by my mother) for a long walk for the first time since I began my self-isolation living like a hermit after graduating highschool.

I listened to powerful emotional music while on my walk and thought of her and for the first time I walked up with my head high, high on confidence, in public.

At one point it was so euphoric and aesthetically pleasing (cloudy winter dusk while walking in an empty quiet park path surrounded by tall trees, snow, cozy yellow streetlights, beautiful music, and snowflakes falling gently while the wind blew in my face) that I started smiling uncontrollably in extreme euphoria, despite it being freezing cold and having ice particles poking at my face.

I embraced the cold and struggle of the winter instead of having a feeling of anger and suffering like I used to whenever I walked outside in the cold. It was like the feeling of getting goosebumps while listening to music but tenfold stronger.

I lived more in a day than I did in the last 19 months and to say it was overwhelming is an understatement. But because I had to constantly use my infatuation/sadness of being lonely/realization I'm missing out on life to get through the day with motivation, it bottled up that feeling of sorrow and rapid heart rate the entire day.



Even though I felt good throughout the day, I felt sorrow creeping in as well. At the end of the day I realized I needed to let the emotion out and felt a sudden urge to cry and sobbed the hardest in years and maybe even my life for an hour in my bathtub while burying my face and wrapping my arms around a towel.

It was hard to pinpoint what made me cry because I just felt a need to get emotion out without deeper analysis, maybe it was the realization of time wasted, being attention and intimacy starved, being overwhelmed by massive life changes in a single day. Probably a combination of all of these since I thought about all of them while sobbing.



My question/plea for help is if this parasocial infatuation being used as motivation and life fuel is beneficial to me (getting stuff done) despite the fact that it makes me feel sorrow at the same time?

I had moments throughout the day where I felt regret for getting hard work done and wanted to go back to the same old of doing nothing with my life.

Why is that? Is that just my brain associating the emotion of sorrow of missing out on life with my actions today instead of realizing that it's counterintuitive and my actions are how I avoid missing out on life?

I'm going to continue doing it regardless if it is or isn't good for my psyche because it's the only thing that motivates me in my life (remember that I tried and failed to do things like this for the last 19 months until yesterday) and I don't want to go back into doing nothing and feeling even bigger regret when I'm older.

I don't know why she in particular changed my life but she did. It's a mental conflict to me that something normally unhealthy and never ""motivational"" like a parasocial relationship from softcore pornography has helped me so much in my life and motivated me to change my life.



I'm sorry for writing so much and making so many different points, but I needed a way to journal and let these emotions out and all of this has been racing through my head in the last two days myself so I can't say I know where the problem comes from. It took me over an hour to gather my thoughts here so I really hope somebody here can give me comfort and advice.",2,1740367246.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

1iws7mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1iws7mg/10mil_in_a_hull_a/,10mil in a Hull A,"After making some changes to my route and doing a couple routes per day, I just passed the 10,000,000 auec mark by running cargo mission routes in a Hull A.

**Route**

* Start in a primary station like Everus Harbor.  
* Pick a Member or Experienced Solar Small or Solar Extra Small mission.  It will have 3-4 stations to deliver to out of 5 or 6 options for that starting point (I think it's 5). Each location will require between 2 and 15 SCU. (I they seem to intentionally avoid 8 and 16...)
* In notepad++, mark off the 4 quadrants of the ship (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right). Assign each one to a destination and allow it to have up to 16 SCU of cargo. (Yes, this means losing some space. It's worth the sanity savings) 
* Stack missions going from the starting point to those same destinations. They'll be either local or direct local. Load each mission's cargo before selecting the next one, so it's fastest/easiest to load to the correct quadrant. If you try to load 2+ missions at once, you will hate life and risk the box mixup bug.  (two boxes of the same material from different missions don't complete each others' missions)
* Stack missions again, this time from the destinations back to the starting point. You can be less careful about going past 16 per quadrant and just fill the ship.
* Start the deliveries. Each one with the following actions : 
   * Land
   * DOUBLE CHECK THE DESTINATION  (seriously, if you did a routing hop you could lose your sanity if you mix it up)
   * Restore fuel. Yes, even for short jumps. This avoids the invisible ""out of fuel"" bug
   * Turn off the ship. This avoids the ""it's hovering away..."" bug that's annoyingly common.
   * Unload. This is very quick as it's just one ship quadrant. No thinking or checking needed.
   * Load the ""return"" mission back into whatever quadrants you've already dropped off from.
   * Mark if off in notepad or you'll question which one you're on after the 3rd one
* Finish off back where you started
* Makes roughly 300k-350k per trip.

**Notes**

* Why not planetary, since it's shorter distance? : I did this for a while. Atmosphere makes it take a lot longer.  This also avoids the infinitely loading elevator bug that seems to be getting more common.
* Why Hull A ? : Easy to split into quadrants. Insanely cheap. Best size-to-SCU ratio. Easiest to load/unlock (external cargo). And the other cargo ships annoy me for various reasons below.
* Why not direct so you don't have to track anything?  I did this for a while too. It's certainly simpler, but was averaging 150k per trip before running out of matching missions. SOMETIMES I would hit 250k IF I was lucky. Rare.
* Why not use the tracking tools some redditors have made?  Early days. I like the concepts, but they're far less efficient and more time consuming than just using notepad++.  It doesn't matter how cool a tool is if it makes the task worse.   I'll check back in later to see how they've improved.
* Why cargo? Because it's something I can do easily while drinking my morning coffee and on my lunch break. I know most of the bug workarounds. I enjoy the organizational aspect. I'm utterly HORRENDOUS at ship combat. My PC is ancient so can't handle FPS combat. And it's incredibly low risk.  I'll sometimes mix in salvage, but cargo is the primary.

**Other Ship Rants/Reasons**

* Taurus : Most popular cargo ship. But... I dislike the cargo grid being 3 high. This means you can't easily spam the missions it was designed for which mostly use 8 scu boxes. So you need a mix with 1-4 SCU boxes. The grid elevator is also highly volatile during slow server moments where the boxes bounce around on the tractor beam. Also have some bugs with the freight elevator eating boxes (usually one per trip, thus lowering rewards). Tractor beam is at an annoying position. Elevator and freight elevator are buggy as hell.  The concept is great and it's almost perfectly designed, but has too many annoying issues. Maybe in the future
* Hull B : would be ideal. But... yeah...
* Raft : Great ship design. But it's in an awkward spot where it wants 32 SCU boxes.... but 32 SCU box missions want you to haul hundreds of SCU while 90 SCU missions give 1-8 SCU boxes.  You CAN use smaller boxes. But there's a bug that causes them to fly around, destroying the weirdly fragile ship legs. Somehow the elevator is VASTLY more consistent than the Taurus.
* Freelancer MAX: It was ""ok"". Secondary storage room is utterly useless and not worth the time to squeeze boxes in. Back door is obnoxiously buggy and has to be opened from the cockpit. Hated the view. 
* Zeus : only looking at ships purchasable in-game.
* Corsair : Amazing ship design. One of my favorites. But at 6.5 mil, I'm mostly paying for combat capabilities that I don't be using. So it's effectively 3x more expensive for an 8 SCU increase. Maybe get it later when I try to do multiplayer ship combat or piracy.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iwrzai,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1iwrzai/how_to_build_a_distractionfree_work_zone_anywhere/,How to Build a Distraction-Free Work Zone Anywhere,"Ever find yourself staring at the wall, wondering why you can’t focus, even though you *really* need to get stuff done? It’s like there’s an invisible force pulling you toward every possible distraction—even that dusty Sudoku book you forgot you had suddenly seems fascinating. I’ve been there.

**Here’s what I’ve noticed works when trying to create a cozy bubble of productivity**:

• **Pick a secret spot**: The kitchen table. A corner of your living room. A tiny, underappreciated desk space in your bedroom. If you make even a small space feel intentional—by clearing clutter or rearranging furniture—it can transform into your personal productivity HQ.

• **Set the vibe**: Lighting can be a game-changer. If you’re like me, you might work better under dimmer, warmer lights. Others thrive in bright, daylight-like conditions. Experiment to see what energizes you most. Oh, and a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones can feel like a superhero cape.

• **Declutter like it’s your last day on Earth**: Random receipts, snack wrappers, old coffee cups—sometimes they’re just a subtle reminder of all the other things you ‘could’ be doing. Clearing them away makes space for clearer thinking. 

• **Create little triggers for work mode**: Maybe it’s playing instrumental music, lighting a candle, or even changing into “work zone” socks (yes, I have a pair of socks I only wear when I need to get serious). It signals your brain that it’s time to focus.

I’ve tried dozens of productivity apps, but at the end of the day, sometimes a clean table, a solid playlist, and a really good snack by your side does the trick. It’s all about finding what sparks that sense of calm determination—no matter where you are. 

And who knows, maybe you’ll find the simplest solution ends up being the most effective. It can feel pretty amazing once you realize you don’t need a fancy setup to banish distractions and get in the zone—just a bit of planning and a willingness to try something new.",1,1740365825.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

So Friday I stopped before work to do a coffee run for my coworkers in the morning

Texted everyone what they wanted and ordered. I made sure everyone replied before leaving

So I get to work hand out the orders and everything seems fine

Until I get pulled aside by Emily to talk about something. I'm thinking it has to do with work

She asks me why I thought it was appropriate to buy coffee for Lucy

Lucy is 7 months pregnant. Her and I get along and are friends outside of work.  We all do dinners and hangout as a group ect. I even babysit for her 5yr old. (We have know each other before working together)

I tell her Lucys doctor was OK with it and frankly it shouldn't be her concern and if it is to talk to Lucy. 

This is the first small iced coffee she has had her entire pregnancy as i have done these runs before ad she usually just orders a tea or nothing at all

(she takes very good care of her eating, exercises ect Baby is healthy)  and that if the baby wasn't Lucy would not chance that. 

 I tell her I cannot police someone and if she wanted a coffee she would have just bought one herself anyway

Emily then tells me I am a horrible person who is putting Lucy's child at risk

I tell her I appreciate her concern but it isn't my problem.  I again cannot tell Lucy what she can and can't eat or drink. 

Lucy told me she was fine but now Emily barely responds to me or Lucy. Which is frustrating when I am going over the schedule for the  day and Emily doesn't respond when I ask her a question or just says yup got it

I don't feel as bad but now I'm feeling alittle guilty. 

I tried to handle it professionally and maybe my wording was wrong?

I am the manager but I feel like this is a personal issue not a work related one

A city that prides itself on being organized and disciplined, pero bakit parang laging may sablay? Ang daming issues, ang daming ingay, at parang hindi nauubusan ng drama. Bakit kahit anong pilit mong intindihin, may bago na namang dahilan para mapaisip kung ano bang meron sa lugar na ‘to? Bakit laging may kaunting gulo, kaunting kaguluhan, o simpleng kawalan ng kaayusan na parang hindi mo inaasahan sa isang lugar na dapat maayos?

Tapos ‘yung schools nila—OLOPSC, Marist, FEU Marikina—bakit parang laging may bagong problema? Bakit ang daming intriga? Bakit parang hindi nauubusan ng students na either sobrang entitled o wala sa ayos? Mayabang pero walang laman, laging may isyu pero walang resolusyon. Parang may kultura ng pagiging pasaway na hindi mo maintindihan kung saan nanggaling.

At paano naman ‘yung mga Starbucks branches nila? Bakit parang hindi mo alam kung coffee shop ba o extension ng mga bahay nila? Bakit parang hindi pwedeng tahimik at maayos lang? Bakit laging may grupo na masyadong maingay, masyadong may pakiramdam na sila lang ang nandoon? At kung hindi customers ang problema, bakit naman minsan ‘yung staff mismo parang hindi alam ang ginagawa?

Pero ang pinakanakakapagtaka sa lahat—bakit sa Ayala Marikina Starbucks, parang lahat ng ito ay pinagsama-sama? Bakit parang hindi mo alam kung service ba ang problema o ‘yung mismong atmosphere? Bakit parang ang staff hindi sigurado sa trabaho nila, habang ang customers naman parang hindi marunong umangkop sa public space? Bakit parang wala nang distinction between coffee shop at personal living room?

At bakit kaya halos lahat ng nakikilala kong taga-Marikina, parang may common trait na hindi mo ma-explain? Bakit parang may sense of entitlement, pero kulang sa consideration? Bakit parang hindi nila narerealize na minsan, hindi lang sarili nila ang dapat isipin?

Pero sige, kung may isang bagay na maganda sa Marikina, siguro ‘yung park nila. At least ‘yun, hindi pa sumasablay… for now?

EDIT:

Ang dami sa inyo ang nagko-comment ng “sA iBaNG lUgAr nG pInAs gAnyan Din s4 Ibang C1tI3s.” LMAO SIGE, let’s address that.

First of all, hindi naman ako taga-Marikina. Pero madalas ako napapadpad dito dahil sa work and other commitments. I’ve been to multiple cities—as in hindi lang isang beses, hindi lang isang area, at hindi lang Metro Manila. Kaya masasabi kong may basis yung observations ko.

Kung ganito rin sa ibang cities, bakit parang mas amplified sa Marikina? Bakit sa ibang lugar, kahit may issues, hindi ganito kagrabe ang overall impression? Bakit sa ibang cities, may balance kahit papaano, pero dito parang paulit-ulit at concentrated ang mga ganitong problema?

Ang dami sa inyo defensive agad, pero imbes na i-dismiss niyo na “ganun din naman sa iba,” hindi niyo ba naisip tanungin—bakit ang lala sa Marikina? Bakit parang may pattern? Bakit consistent ang mga ganitong observations sa iba’t ibang aspeto ng lugar niyo?

Kasi kung lahat ng cities may ganyang issues pero ang Marikina lang ang madalas napapansin for it, then maybe, just maybe, may something talaga sa inyo na worth questioning.

Me (26 M) and my Friend (23 F), lets call her Morgan, met about 4 years ago through an online video game community. Morgan and I became quick friends where we proceeded to talk to each other on a daily basis. After speaking for a while we learned that we lived about an hour away from each other but since we were both heavy introverts and very shy, we never met in person, and she eventually moved out of state. We continued talking and after about 6 months of talking, we opened up to each other about our feelings for one another. We never made anything official, but our talking deepened after this, and we even got to the point of sexting and sending NSFW pictures of ourselves. About a few weeks to a month after we opened up to each other, I had a mental snap and convinced myself that I was not deserving of any friends, including Morgan and continued to self-destruct all my friendships, including ours. I never gave her much detail, but I basically told her that I was dealing with a lot of things and needed some space, where I proceeded to block her. After I fully got control of my emotions a day or so later, I realized the mistake that I made but felt too ashamed of myself for putting her through that that I decided not to reach out.

  
A few months go by, and I log onto a video game her and I use to play together and noticed that this was one of the few places I did not remove or block her, and, at the time, she was online. I decided to message her a short apology and asked her how she was doing. She responded accepting my apology and we began to have small talk about the game and life as a whole. The conversation was short lived and these types of conversations became the norm for a while. I would see her online every few weeks to a month, I would message her, we would have some small talk, and we go our separate ways.

  
Fast forward to 2024 (about 2 years after our falling out) and she messages me one day when I am online if I could come and help her with something in the game which turned into the first time we had played together in a few years. While playing, we ended up having more deeper conversations about life and this is where I find out that she has been in a relationship for over a year now and that she moved back home to the same state I am to live with him. After talking for a while, Morgan asked if I would like to meet him, and he ended up joining us in the game after a few minutes. The 3 of us got along together really well and they began to ask me to start hanging out with the friend group they had. After a short amount of time, they asked if I wanted to meet up in person for lunch one day, which despite being shy and introverted, I accepted. The lunch went over very well, despite none of us being very social people, we managed to push through it, and we all had a good time, so going out to eat or hanging out at the mall became a weekly tradition for us for a while.

Fast forward to end of 2024 and this is where the story begins to get complicated. During this time Morgan and I began talking more and more. I had unblocked her from social media, and we began to talk more and more frequent to where we talked basically talked 24/7. Then it hits me one day, my feelings are back for her. I catch myself smiling at messages, I catch myself always wanting to talk to her and just genuinely enjoyed her presence, but I did not want to bring anything up to her because I knew she obviously could not reciprocate the feelings due to her relationship and I did not want to add any weird tension in ours, so I kept them to myself.

  
As the months go on, Morgan and I continued to become closer and closer to the point where we are starting to be very affectionate with each other. Telling each other how much we mean to each other, saying how much we miss the other when there is no instant response, and even just saying that we love each other and the friendship that has sprouted. In my head, things were great and I was so glad to have such a strong friendship but the problem is, thats not where we stopped. We continued to get closer. We started by giving each other compliments, which turned into playful and nonserious flirting overtime. This flirting originally only stayed in dms but it soon started to creep into in person interactions. There was a day where Morgan, her bf, and I were out getting coffee and her bf went to the bathroom and we were laughing having a good time and i was jokingly reaching for her drink to take it away and she puts her hand on mind to push it away and its like we just froze. Her hand on mine. We were not looking at each other and were still continuing to laugh and having a goodtime, but neither of us moved our hands. This lasted for maybe a minute or 2 when we heard the bathroom door open and we both pulled away. This is where the guilt starts. I was starting to realize that that was not normal, but I convinced myself I was overthinking and kind of dropped it, but that was only the start of what was to come.

  
After that day, moments like that started happening more and more. Sometimes it was me, sometimes it was her, sometimes it was both of us. It felt like we were finding any opportunity to share that affection even getting to the point of her laying in my arms one time her boyfriend had to leave to get something when I was at their house. At this point, it was nearly undeniable what was happening and my guilt ever increased because I could not find it in me to stop it or even really bring it up to her and I started becoming the villain of this story. It even got to the point to where she was inviting me over when her boyfriend had to head to work where we would just sit outside on either a park bench or table. Our usual spot was this picnic table that she would sit on and I would stand between her legs and we would either be holding hands or just wrapping our arms around each other. We never kissed, we never went farther physically than the closeness described here, but the key word is physical. There were a few nights where our ""playful"" flirting turned into real sexting.

At this point, it is approaching new years, and I had fallen in love with her but it had all started to eat at me. This whole time I basically refused to even acknowledge the deeper meaning of anything that was happening and was just trying to enjoy the moments as they came but I could only do that for so long. Eventually, the wave of guilt and realization of what was happening was hitting me. I felt and feel like a horrible person for even letting it get to a fraction of what it was so I decided to bring it up to her. I asked to talk her alone one day and addressed the elephant in the room. What was this? Why are we doing this? What does any of this mean? I could tell she was also refusing to think more about any of this because when I brought it up, I could see her soul sink. She admitted that when I came back, that there was still a small fire for me after I left that she didn't acknowledge and it just blew up to what it was. She admitted that things between her and her bf were rough and it was nice to get so much attention and affection from someone since her bf was not giving her ""enough"". In her words, I was filling the voids he was leaving. We talked about what was next. She came to the conclusion that she wanted to hunker down with her boyfriend and fix the problems. 

The problem with this is even though it shouldn't have, those words devastated me. I had realized that I wanted her and that I had fully fallen in love with her and despite how wrong I knew it was, my heart kept wanting me to fight for it, but I had at least enough self control to not but I know I am still an asshole in this situation. Our friendship for the next few weeks was awkward. There was less talking and when we did, it was back to the short, small talk, but not too far down the line did we break out of that cycle and we lead to the now situation.

It has been roughly 2-3 months since the talk about the situation going on between us and now, I am not even sure how to feel about everything. We are back to talking like normal without \*much\* of the problematic talks. The reason I say much is because I see glimpses of ourselves of how we were. We still jokingly flirt, we both make ""sexual comments"" about each other that we never let amount to anything, but there is still a lot of questions. She still wants to share physical affection with me. She still asks me to cuddle (only over dms not in person) and occasionally wants to still have physical affectionate moments with me. Just a week or 2 ago, I was at their place and we were watching a movie and the bboyfriend and I were laying on the couch while Morgan was on the couch. Her boyfriend fell asleep and I was laying to the side of the couch and lifted my hand over the couch to ask for a fist bump and I feel her hand on my wrist and she slowly started rubbing her hand slowly up and down my arm and we proceeded to hold hands once more. Again, I feel heavy guild because despite my brain telling me how wrong it is, my heart overrides it and lets it happen. After I went home that night, I asked her why she wanted to do that again and she said that to her it didnt mean anything and that its just her showing affection to her best friend in a platonic way. I try to believe that at face value but it just does not seem really believable to me and now I am just dealing with a flood of emotions: Love, Confusion, Guilt, Hatred towards myself, and heavy uncertainty. Its at the point where I have asked her a few times the meaning of some of the things she does and she always responds with its her way of showing love to me in a platonic way but that answer does not line up well with her actions for me. All I want is full clarity so I can at least understand the situation and this uncertainty has kind of given me paralysis, preventing me from doing the things I know I need to do in this situation like drawing the boundaries myself.

In the first scene of Crusade, we get a nameless woman, a video from Chloe, and the best introduction of a character. Lois the GOAT Lane. I love that she's already talking fast, drinking coffee, telling herself not to smoke. She's one of the only characters we see speak her inner monologue and it's so fitting for her character. She's just driving along, and then BAM! Her future father in law facilitates a meet cute with her soulmate! Lol I don't know if that's what they intended, but that's what I see. It's also the same field that the Kent's found Clark. Lois' first word in the show is her future last name lol, and her first words to Clark are, ""Are you ok?"" A hilarious interaction where Lois tries and fails to not check out a completely naked man, but then she goes to get him a red blanket. Definitely symbolizing a cape. Lois herself is wearing red in this episode. And Clark, as Kal-El, wants to know her name. ""Wait. Who are you?"" ""Lois. Lois Lane."" That never gets old! One of my favorite moments!

Next scene has Lois taking this man to the hospital, begrudgingly staying, and checking him out once again lol. But it's Clark, even as a blank Kal-El, who is willing to let this stranger pull him wherever and keep him in one place. And he's just content to sit there and watch and listen, soaking in everything Lois is saying like a sponge. But, he has a mission and must go. Lois tries to stop him and he easily picks her up and gently moves her out of his way, to which she has a little grin, because who wouldn't be impressed with that? I certainly would lol. Then, Lois is the reason Kal-El is reunited with Martha, his link to his human side. I love the continuity of Lois being ""a sucker for stray dogs and naked guys.""  Lois finds out this stranger is who she is looking for and she goes over to their place, has a nice moment with Martha while acting like she belongs there, getting a cup and pouring herself some coffee. I should find it obnoxious and rude, but I just find it charming. We get Martha propping up Clark as more than a farmboy, and Lois stating ""give me a nerd with glasses any day of the week"", foreshadowing yet again her future with Clark. Martha gently but firmly ushers Lois out, and Lois takes the hint. 

This isn't really pertaining to Clois, but I love Lois' scene with Lionel, one of very few that she gets over the whole series. She's not even a reporter yet, but she reads the situation and knows that Lionel will see her if he thinks she's Martha, and then she holds her own when talking to him, and gets the last word. Amazing.

The final scene with Lois and Clark has so much foreshadowing, it's wild. Starting with Lois just talking at Chloe's grave. She says she didn't go to her funeral and hates funerals. There are 2 funerals that she chooses to go to, for Clark. She thinks being vulnerable means being weak and hates that she is. She will learn that there is strength in that vulnerability. And then Clark's first words to Lois, when he is himself again, are ""You're not alone."" Big foreshadowing to what they will come to mean to each other. And Clark, who says the last few days are all hazy and jumbled, recites perfectly and in sequence the things he learned about Lois as Kal-El. ""Chloe's cousin. Nicorette addiction. Can't stand uncomfortable silences."" He tells Lois he can't explain his behavior, and instead of her demanding something, she takes it all in stride. When Lois implies she's the only one actively doing something about Chloe's death, Clark bristles. ""I get the feeling you like to do things yourself."" ""My dad raised me to be independent and self-sufficient"". Clark volleys with ""That'd be one way to describe you"" Lois sees it for the thinly veiled insult it is and parries back with ""You know the only thing I like about you at the moment is your mom. You can't possibly be as weird as I think you are with a mom that cool."" Clark shakes his head and smiles, and we know from the script that this is conveying his intrigue. Lois is unlike anyone he's ever met. This leads Clark to teaming up with Lois to find out what happened with Chloe. Working together is his idea, as is Lois staying with him and his parents while she is in town. This dude has the biggest secret ever that he is constantly terrified of being discovered, but somehow he is instantly at ease with Lois, so much so that he willing invites her into his house and by extension his life. Lois is very guarded, and she contemplates his offer, but ultimately accepts, teasingly telling Clark she doesn't pay attention to curfew and never makes her bed. And then, once Clark x-rays Chloe's grave and finds her casket empty, instead of getting more information or waiting a minute, he immediately tells Lois that Chloe is alive. And the first teamup of Lois and Clark uncovering the truth is born!

So much of Lois and Clark's dynamic is set up in this first episode, it is nuts how much they were able to pack in. The flirty banter, the ease with one another, the similar desire to find the truth, the subtle and not so subtle attraction. A fantastic start!",1,1740365489.0,Cloisville,0,1.0,False

1iwru5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabeticfirstcure/comments/1iwru5h/fuel_your_health_the_ultimate_superfoods_for/,Fuel Your Health: The Ultimate Superfoods for Diabetes Management,"Here’s a detailed overview of various superfoods that can be especially beneficial for people managing diabetes. I’ve compiled the points based experience, research, and feedback from fellow diabetics, both Type 1 and Type 2, with the goal of managing blood sugar and improving insulin sensitivity.

**Top 25 Superfoods for Managing Diabetes:**

**1. Grapefruit:** Grapefruit is an excellent choice for diabetics due to its low glycemic index (GI) of 25, meaning it has a minimal effect on blood sugar levels. It's high in vitamin C, antioxidants, and dietary fiber, making it a great choice for improving overall health. Its water content (90%) aids in hydration, and its 9 grams of net carbs per 100 grams make it a smart fruit for diabetics.

**2. Raspberries and Blackberries:** Both these berries have impressive nutritional profiles, with only 5 grams of net carbs per 100 grams and GIs of 32 and 25, respectively. They're packed with antioxidants, fiber, and vitamin C. Their natural sweetness, without a significant blood sugar spike, makes them a perfect addition to smoothies or yogurt bowls.

**3. Goji Berries:** Known for their antioxidant properties, Goji berries are a superfood that can help regulate metabolism and protect the eyes. They have a moderate GI of 29 and contain 19 grams of fiber per 100 grams, lowering the net carbs to around 30 grams. While they're sweet and can cause slight blood sugar increases, their overall nutrient density makes them valuable when consumed in moderation.

**4. Coconut:** Coconut, classified as a fruit, is low in carbs and rich in healthy fats. Raw coconut provides just 6 grams of net carbs per 100 grams. With a GI of 42, it offers a slower blood sugar impact, especially when consumed in whole or unprocessed forms like coconut milk or coconut water. This tropical fruit provides a great variety of ways to incorporate healthy fats into your diet.

**5. Guava:** This tropical fruit is rich in vitamin C and fiber, with only 9 grams of net carbs per 100 grams and a very low GI of 12 (in some varieties). Guava’s seeds provide added fiber, which further stabilizes blood sugar, and it’s versatile for smoothies or simply eaten as a snack. Watch out for varieties with higher GIs, though, depending on their origin.

**6. Avocado:** Avocados are a diabetic’s best friend due to their low carb content (only 3 grams of net carbs per 100 grams) and a glycemic index of just 15. The healthy fats, fiber, and vitamins found in avocado help improve insulin sensitivity and maintain steady blood sugar levels. Its creamy texture and mild flavor make it an easy addition to any meal.

**Favorite Vegetables for Managing Blood Sugar:**

**7. Pumpkin:** Pumpkin is a superfood rich in vitamins A, C, and K. Although it contains 12 net carbs per serving, it’s low in sugar, making it ideal for diabetics when consumed in moderation. Roasting pumpkin with healthy oils and adding chia seeds can slow the digestion process and further stabilize blood sugar levels.

**8. Zucchini:** Zucchini is a low-calorie, low-carb vegetable that has less than 1 net carb per serving. It’s packed with antioxidants, vitamin A, and vitamin C. Zucchini’s versatility makes it easy to add to a variety of dishes, whether in soups, stews, or salads, without worrying about spiking blood sugar.

**9. Bell Peppers:** Bell peppers are a great source of antioxidants and vitamin C. Despite their natural sweetness, they have just 4 net carbs per serving and are low in sugars, making them perfect for blood sugar control. Combining them with high-fiber ingredients, such as beans, helps to prevent blood sugar spikes.

**10. Potatoes:** Though potatoes have a higher glycemic index, there are ways to make them more blood sugar-friendly. Choosing types like sweet potatoes, which have a lower GI, and keeping the skin on for added fiber helps slow digestion. Additionally, cooling boiled potatoes before consumption increases the resistant starch content, which aids in managing blood sugar levels.

**11. Broccoli:** Broccoli is a fiber-rich vegetable loaded with essential vitamins like vitamin C and vitamin K, and it contains only 3.5 grams of net carbs per cup. This makes it an excellent option for controlling blood sugar levels while providing a hearty dose of nutrients. It can be easily added to meals as a side dish or used to create a creamy, healthy soup.

**12. Garlic:** Garlic, although aromatic, is a powerful vegetable that offers anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting benefits. With only 1 carb per clove, garlic can add flavor to a variety of meals without negatively impacting blood sugar levels. It’s especially beneficial when sautéed in olive oil and added to soups or stews.

**Bonus Superfoods:**

**13. Shrimp:** Shrimp is a fantastic source of lean protein with no carbs and a glycemic index of zero. It’s rich in essential nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B12, and selenium. Shrimp is an excellent option for those looking to control blood sugar and add variety to their meals.

**14. Black Beans:** Black beans are a high-fiber, nutrient-dense food that contains approximately 45 grams of carbs per 100 grams. After deducting fiber, the net carbs are around 30 grams. With a moderate GI and high levels of folate, iron, and magnesium, black beans are a smart choice when consumed in moderation and combined with other low-GI foods.

**15. Spinach:** Spinach is another low-carb vegetable with only 1 net carb per serving. It’s loaded with vitamins like A, C, and K, and contains antioxidants that promote heart health and reduce inflammation. It’s also a great source of magnesium, which plays a key role in insulin sensitivity.

**16. Kale:** Kale, another dark leafy green, is high in antioxidants and contains only 1.4 grams of net carbs per 100 grams. It provides a good source of vitamin K, vitamin C, and calcium. Kale can be used in salads, smoothies, or as a side dish to enhance nutrient intake without spiking blood sugar.

**17. Chia Seeds:** Chia seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and protein. They help slow down digestion and prevent blood sugar spikes. With just 1 gram of net carbs per tablespoon, chia seeds can be added to smoothies, oatmeal, or even as a topping for yogurt to boost overall blood sugar control.

**18. Almonds:** Almonds are high in healthy fats and fiber, with only 2 grams of net carbs per ounce. They have a low glycemic index and help promote satiety, which is essential for managing blood sugar and weight. Snacking on almonds or adding them to meals can keep blood sugar levels stable throughout the day.

**19. Cinnamon:** Cinnamon has been shown to help improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar levels. It’s a great spice to add to both sweet and savory dishes. Sprinkle it on oatmeal, smoothies, or even in coffee to enjoy its blood sugar benefits.

**20. Turmeric:** Turmeric contains curcumin, which has potent anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce insulin resistance. Adding turmeric to meals, smoothies, or even golden milk (a warm drink made with turmeric, milk, and spices) can aid in controlling blood sugar levels and improve overall health.

**Harmful Foods to Avoid for Diabetics:**

In addition to incorporating these superfoods, it’s important to avoid certain foods that can spike blood sugar and interfere with diabetes management:

1.     **Sugary Beverages:** Sodas, sweetened teas, and juices contain high amounts of sugar, which can lead to rapid blood sugar spikes. Opt for water, herbal teas, or sparkling water instead.

2.     **Refined Carbs:** Foods like white bread, pasta, and pastries made from refined flour cause rapid increases in blood sugar. Whole grains are a much healthier option.

3.     **Fried Foods:** Fried foods, often high in unhealthy fats, can contribute to weight gain and insulin resistance, negatively impacting blood sugar control.

4.     **Processed Meats:** Processed meats like bacon, sausages, and deli meats are high in sodium, preservatives, and unhealthy fats, making them detrimental to blood sugar levels and overall health.

5.     **Full-Fat Dairy:** Full-fat dairy products can contribute to inflammation and worsen insulin resistance. Opt for low-fat or plant-based alternatives to support blood sugar management.

These 25 superfoods provide a variety of options that can help support healthy blood sugar levels, insulin sensitivity, and overall health. Integrating them into your diet regularly can help you better manage diabetes while maintaining a delicious and nutritious eating plan.

Note:- **Consult a Healthcare Professional**: Always discuss dietary changes with a doctor or nutritionist, especially if you’re taking medication, as certain foods can interact with treatments.

I had some guy friends growing up, and a few in college, but there are only a couple that I still talk to; which, at most, is a message or two throughout the year. Currently, a majority of my friends are women, but as they get married or date, I see them less often. Plus, always being that third wheel gets old and depressing. lol

As well, I think why I gravitated more towards women friends is because I felt more comfortable being myself around them. I wasn’t typically into your traditional guy stuff—sports, the outdoors, cars. Additionally, I’m a short guy, and because of that, I was always kind of self-conscious throughout my years in school. Nowadays, I think there’s still some of that lingering around, but I’ve also learned it’s not worth worrying about.

Anyways, I guess throughout those years, I feel like I’ve missed out on those brotherly bonds that guys can make with each other. To be honest, while I do have an older brother, when I think of who I would have as my groomsmen, I come up blank; and to me, that’s pretty sad.

So, I guess here am. Trying to meet other guys that may also be in the same boat.

I live in a building complex with an elevator, a guard, two automatic double-door entrances and security cameras.

I've seen the footage. The driver simply drops the bag on the floor between the two doors (after the first door, but before the locked intercom door). They take a picture of the bag on the ground and simultaneously ring the apartment number. Then, they immediately pickup the bag and walk back to their car.

I've contacted GrubHub and they said that without proof they won't do anything except refund or re-order for me. It takes me ages, if I'll even be successful, to get CCTV footage from my building's administration, and I'm afraid that at one point if this keeps happening, GrubHub won't refund me anymore thinking I'm some scammy user.

Anecdote:

I've read on other posts on this sub that drivers are ""hungry"" or that its tip/wage related (not that it's an excuse). Even if that were true, the foods that were stolen from me this splurge and also previous times were ""*sexy*"" foods like fast-food, fries, iced coffee, etc. When it's a vegetable soup you can bet they don't steal it.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\

  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

We weren't the best of friends, because in hindsight the friendship had undertones of sexual tension and we were just too awkward around each other. We had never flirted or touched, but we talked about anime for hours when we hung out. Very little texting. But he helped me move to his town for school, always treated me with kindness and I reciprocated his niceness. I had noticed him check me out couple times but I thought it was just instinctual because he was seeing another girl. I used to tell him a lot of stuff about my life and he always listened and shared stuff too. I thought our friendship was blossoming, we had too many things in common. One time he drove an hour just to come get a coffee with me. I was seeing another friend, but I had not gotten in a relationship yet. 

Then, few months in, he suddenly ghosts me. I was going through some anxiety episode at the time and told him that him ghosting me makes me more anxious, so he should communicate. I was so confused by his new persona. I apologized unnecessarily, not knowing what exactly had happened. After a lot of pleading, he sent a harsh message that he feels uncomfortable being my friend because *I am getting too close to him and we should never talk to each other again*. I was very hurt and told him so, and he replied with a deflective message that his intention was not to hurt me, he thinks we are incompatible as friends. We haven't talked since. He looks away if we cross each other's path.

I'm sure he cared about me, and I had feelings for him that I only realized after we stopped being friends. Idk why he acted so harsh and knowingly hurt me, its unbelievable. I almost think he had strong feelings for me too, but how can a man who has feelings for you, hurt you so badly and end the friendship, and never even nod at you as you cross his path? Am I delusional? Did our bond mean nothing to him? I'm pretty sure I never did anything to hurt him. What am I missing? ",0,1740364079.0,AskMenAdvice,74,0.5,False

No big deal as those will be for PVA and stringers and whatnot. Rather partial to these as this is the bait that landed me my 37.5lb common in October. 

Going to work on my coffee/cream boilies, too. I made a small test batch and fished them once and landed a 12lb channel cat at the lake. They're not all 12lb...they're barely 2-3... But it was a cool flavor AND I had a use for my old pour over grounds.

1iwrds5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1iwrds5/i_think_my_wife_saw_something_in_the_forest/,I think my wife saw something in the forest,"
How long does grieving last? I asked myself every single day for almost 3 years since my wife disappeared, and I never got an answer. The reminder that I was alone came every time I woke up and went to bed. Eventually, the reality sets in and I start to get used to eating alone, brushing my teeth alone, grocery shopping alone, and just being alone. I thought enough time had passed that I didn't have to ask myself that question anymore until the day I got a phone call from the nursing team who took care of my mother-in-law. Denise, the old lady, was planning on moving herself into a nearby nursing home, but now it sounds like she had too, passed.



When I arrived at their home I was met by one of the nurses who had taken care of Denise. She tried to leave quickly, not wanting to stay around the house long. We had a small conversation about where everything was in the home, and how most of the things inside were packed up and ready for storage, and then were given a set of keys for the house, each labeled with the rooms inside.



I tried to ask for more details, but all the nurse gave me was a passing chuckle as she turned to go to her car, getting inside and driving away without another word. It was a reasonable response when it involved anything that had to do with Denise. The old lady was going on 80 and was unbearable to be around. The last time I had spoken to her most of our conversation was loud coughing and nonsense.



The old house smelt like a hospital. Cardboard boxes were stacked randomly around the home with a thin layer of dust blanketing each surface. The TV and larger furniture stayed unpacked, only covered in a layer of plastic wrap. I was married to my wife for 5 years before she vanished, and I don't recall ever being in her childhood home. The old house sat in a suburban row of homes, all facing away from the tree line leading into the dense woods of the Pacific Northwest.



I stuffed the keys into my pockets and carefully squeezed between the stacked boxes. Small framed pictures of my wife at various ages still hung along the walls and sat across the small coffee table. I guess Denise wanted to take these in her bag, or maybe, like me, it was difficult to let her go.



With no one left in the family, the responsibility fell on me to take care of what was left of their belongings. I figured I would get the boxes to storage and clean the rest of the house before deciding what to do with it. I loaded a couple into my car, staring at the dishes and kitchenware, before stumbling on a pile of boxes with her name written across them.



“Gwen”



I read to the silent house. With a long deep breath, I carried the boxes to the coffee table and opened them. Inside were articles of clothing, old bound notebooks, photo albums, and school memorabilia. I flipped through them, and seeing her on every page brought tears. Her smile lit up each sun-faded page, and each wood frame she was captured in threatened to set on fire with her warmth. These boxes were going to stay with me.



I dried my tears and kept going, wanting to see more of her. I moved away a pile of old clothes and notebooks when my hand met something hard and hollow. Buried at the bottom of one of the boxes, were a hefty bag of small CDs, and a handheld video camera. I pulled them out and immediately went to turn it on. Unsurprisingly, the old thing wouldn't turn on, and the battery compartment was corroded shut with the old batteries still inside. I wrestled with it in the kitchen with a butter knife and got it opened and cleaned, then with the double As from the TV remote, got the thing to switch on. I inspected the camera again, excited to get it working, and saw it had a name written in marker on the side.



“Gwen”



I shuffled through the CDs, each labeled with a date, a few not. The first was for her 8th birthday, the small red-haired girl's face was right up in the camera lens, peering in with her bright steel blue eyes. She let out an excited squeal and ran to hug her parents, thanking her mom and dad for the expensive gift. I guess filmmaking had always been her passion. Her father responded with something unintelligible, and a heavy cough before he left the frame. I had never met the man when he was alive, and she never talked much about him. A moment later he returned with a big birthday cake, and then the three ate it together. The rest of the CD was just them eating before shutting off randomly. The old CDs didn't have that much storage, each having only about 20 minutes of memory.



I spent the next few hours going through her childhood. Several moments in the videos I recall her telling me about, late nights when we would lay in bed and talk until sunrise, other moments just small silly things a child with a video camera would film. Her father eventually showed up less and less in the videos, his cough worsening every time until he was no longer in them. For a long while the videos stopped, a large year-long gap before I saw her face again. Her smiles were never the same, she talked less, and some videos were just her talking about her day to her father and writing silently in her notebooks. Eventually, the pile of memories grew smaller and smaller, and when I almost reached the end of the dated discs, I decided to take a look at one without any date on it.



Heavy breathing interlaced with the crackle of the built-in microphone blasted through the tiny speakers, filling up the empty home more than everything else that night. The screen was dark, with only a small light coming from the left corner of the video. The lens stuttered and focused, eventually I was able to make out a line of trees and a street light, but the image was still blurred. It stayed focused on the dark woods for another moment before the camera was pushed forward, hitting a glass surface before it struggled to focus once again, the heavy breathing of my wife still close to the microphone.



I leaned in as if it would help the video focus, the blurry tree line being barely visible in the dark. Between the breaths of my wife, I could hear the camera force itself to focus, sharpening itself until the woods got steadily more and more visible. The camera stayed like that for 18 minutes, glued in position, and so did my wife. My eyes stayed trained on the trees just like she was in the video, watching for any movement at all, only leaving the treeline to check the timer on the video. It got to 19 minutes, and then as it slowly reached its end something shifted in the trees. The video ended, blinding me with the harsh blue menu of the settings screen.



Immediately I replaced the disk with another unmarked one. The next one was during the day, She stood just at the edge of the woods, camera raised and pointed towards the thick darkness created by the trees. The normally tranquil sounds of birds and nature in the background were sometimes interrupted by a heavy cough. Each time the camera fell for a moment I imagined she tried to stifle her cough. I watched again to the end of this video, all 20 minutes of just the camera pointed into the woods, but nothing happened.



The following four undated videos also showed nothing, just my wife, at various points and locations around her house, filming the woods for twenty minutes. The audio was always just background noise, coughing, and the mechanical whirl of the camera's focus. On the last dated one, I could see her reflection in the window as she filmed.  
She sat in the kitchen, the camera pointed towards the window above her sink, and the tree line beyond her yard. She was probably about 15 or 16 at this point, looking just like the first time we had met in high school. The camera tried to focus again on the woods, zooming between her reflection and the tree line. She let out another cough, this time just a brief one, and then opened a bottle of pills, swallowing them dry before letting the camera roll to its end. I had run out of CDs.



I stood from my spot on the ground and turned towards the kitchen window. It was now nighttime, making the darkness of the treeline even more oppressing than it was a few moments earlier on the screen. I stood and stared for a moment like she did, trying to scan the dark with my eyes but the trees stayed the same.



With a shudder, I pulled the blinds down to shut the window and made my way back to the with the help of my phone light. There were no more videos. I carelessly dumped out the rest of the boxes with her name on them across the floor and found nothing. Realizing what I'd done to what I had left of my wife I started to mournfully repack her items neatly into the boxes when I accidentally kicked something across the ground.



Her notebooks. I picked them up and laid them across the coffee table. There were only 3 of them, one of them a locked toy Barbie notebook that I wasn't going to get open unless I smashed the thing and the other two old leather bound style books. I carefully unwrapped the straps around them and flipped through the weathered pages, mostly filled with bits of writing and drawings.



Across the two available notebooks, her art style visibly improved and she wrote less and less. Like the videos, the drawings were about her and her parents. Unfortunately, they were almost exactly like the videos, chronicling and recording how ill her father eventually got more and more ill. The drawings and entries transitioned from them getting ice cream, hiking, and summer barbecues to hospital visits, sitting on their back porch, and looking into the woods. Then it was just the woods. The second half of her third notebook was just pages and pages of the trees, and nothing more, until the last two pages.



The graphite of the pencil was aggressively forced into the paper, splaying out an image of the tree line into the last two pages of her notebook. I ran my fingers along each tree and could feel them etched into the page, the black powder left behind by her pencil so long ago still stained my fingertips. In the middle of the page, done by what I assumed was an eraser trying to remove the forest from the notebook, stood a gaunt figure towering over the trees.



I closed the notebooks and set them back in the box and sealed them once again. I turned on every light in the house, first the entire ground floor, before making my way to the upstairs. I wanted to snuff out every single dark corner of this home to chase away a fear I refused to acknowledge. I shifted through the key chain in my pocket, entered every room, and turned on every light until I reached the locked door at the end of the hallway. I had one key left, one with her name written on the small tag that clung to it.



“Gwen”



Two times the keys fell out of my hands until I finally got them into the lock. It didn't click like the rest of the doors, but instead, the lock turned with a rusted and sticky scrape. I thought Denise was joking when she said she had left my wife's room the same as the day she left and never opened it, but I realize now that she was telling the truth. I coughed hard as I pushed on the door. It took an agonizing amount of force to open, and as it did it pushed something across the floor, sending dust from on top of the door frame down on my head. My hand reached for where the light switch should be but couldn't find anything. I opened the door wider so that the light from the hallway could spill into the room enough for me to see.



Her desk was stacked with at least a hundred of the same leather-bound notebooks she had in her box, the strap barely holding them close as they were stuffed with extra sheets of paper. Scattered across the ground were even more of them, their pages ripped out. Moonlight tried to enter the room through the window but was forced back by something covering the glass. I took out my phone to shine its light across the walls to see where the ripped pages went. Across every surface possible were drawings of the woods.",3,1740363965.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I've been on zoloft since October and I used to have a celcius every. Single. Day. 

Rn now im on week 13 of being on 100mg. It so far has been a great journey. Today I made a mistake. I thought I could have another celcius (I've been mostly caffeine free the whole time) and I was like sure why not. well after about an hour of drinking about a half of one i felt like I was going to jump out of my skin. The feeling was so bad. I work a desk job processing email request and I couldn't focus. I was just anxious and my heart just felt jumpy. 

I couldn't focus correctly the rest of the day. And my appetite was gone.  I had only eaten a banana by 5 pm. Needless to say I think I'm done with caffeine. And maybe it's for the best. 

Just had to put it out there. 

Zoloft is better than having a celcius  that barely gave me oomph anyways. 

UPDATE: for those who is wondering I stopped taking my B complex vitamin the day after original post (10 days ago) I went and saw my  parents who are huge coffee drinkers I had a cup or two while there. 

My insights is that I was overdoing my B vitamins with the celsius which can increase flushing. I still think I'm going to lay off the caffeine but it's nice to know what caused me to jump out of my skin

Thank you everyone for the insight and I hope everyone has a good week!",1,1740363839.0,zoloft,0,0.67,False

It shouldn’t be acceptable for a man to bother women when she’s out and about just trying to go about her day at the coffee shop or park, or out at the bar with friends.

I think cold approaching, approaching and chatting up random women you don’t know, is no longer acceptable or becoming less acceptable because it’s just not appropriate.

The optimal places for men to meet women outside of college are online dating or hobby groups. That’s where men should stick to, in my opinion. 

Even taking classes such as cooking classes aren’t advisable because many women are just trying to learn and enjoy the activity, they don’t want to be hit on by some desperate man.

Trying to strike up conversation with women at the park or on the street, is both ineffective, displays entitlement to her time, and is intrusive of her space. 

It’s better men leave women alone and approach in socially acceptable places- dating apps and hobby groups.",0,1740363820.0,PurplePillDebate,127,0.49,False

1iwran5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1iwran5/i_keep_finding_handprints_in_impossible_places/,I keep finding handprints in Impossible places ( Retry),"Hey everyone I posted a few days ago my story i wrote asking for critique. I got none. But that's fine I just took it as not good enough to criticize lol. But I added to the original and made it better in my eyes. Hopefully I'll get feed back this time.

Story: 

Yes, the title is accurate; for awhile now, I've been, finding a single handprint somewhere I can't reach. It's right-handed; that's literally all that I know.  I've found prints made from various materials and peculiar places.  The ceiling is always the weirdest spot; it's really freaky. I can't explain why or how this is happening. It's not bothering me to the point I can't live life, but I'm getting really tired of getting spooked.

It all started after my grandfather killed himself, I know we've grieved enough already. My mom had told me asphyxiation was the cause, so he hung himself. PTSD is a bitch.
"" His time in the war was very rough honey. You know he never even wanted to go."" She told me the morning we found out.
 "" Tried running from that draft and ended up with a blown arm."" She sat there rubbing his prosthetic hand, holding the wooden fingers like he did when she was a kid. I could tell it brought her comfort, a way to have him here still. But it hurt way more than anything, tears stained and flowed down her cheeks. But she surprised me when she asked if I could take it home with me. I didn't like it. We didn't have much of a relationship, he spent a lot of his time cooped up in his apartment. Away from us only being seen when we would pick him up for Christmas. Even then, he sat away from us, his eyes constantly wandering. It always unsettled me, like he was tracking something. 

I'm a sucker and I'd do anything for my mom. So, despite my knee-gut reaction towards it, I accepted. She thanked me, saying
""As much as I love him, it's more of a reminder of his suffering. But maybe it can bring you two closer in some way. I mean after all-"" she was cut off by a knock on the door. It was a quick and rapid three knocks, scared the shit outta me. My mom ran over and swung it open, stuck her head out. Weird. She turned back to me giggling to herself.
"" Those kids and their games."" She said to herself. After that, her mood was strangely calm; I figured it was honestly that sick part of us that was kinda relieved he was gone. Not in spite but in that selfish desire we all have. My mom took care of him constantly, being his only daughter; she took pride in being his baby girl. But when he really went downhill, you could see how much it cost her in her eyes alone. We hugged and I began my journey back to my house. It was a good 20-minute drive through the valley of California. During it, though, I thought I kept hearing that same knock; I couldn't pinpoint where it was coming from. Inside my car or outside on my back door.

When I finally got home I just tossed the box with Grandpa in it into my hall closet. I know it's rude and all, but I didn't care at the time, and honestly I just wanted to have it outta my sight. I wanted to cook with peace of mind; I'm a cook for my friend's restaurant nearby, so cooking is my own form of meditation. And honestly, I needed to relax a little, I thought I might make my mom something like cake. Kill two birds with one stone, a gift for her and me. I was collecting up my ingredients, ya know mise en place. I was grabbing my container of flour when those three knocks echoed in my house. I jumped and spilled the flour on the floor and counter; I turned to grab my broom. As I cleaned a sense of fear washed over me, like my body sensed danger I couldn't. As I got up to finish what was left. My heart sank, my stomach ached the feeling of vomiting from overwhelming fear sank deep. The flour was smeared around and a handprint sat in the middle of it all.

I don't know why but I called out
""H-h-hello? Who the fuck is in my house!""  I yelled in an attempt for intimidation. The Silent response was better at it than me. I grabbed my kitchen knife and began a slow walk through my home. Walking through my living room finding specks of flour were on the floor and they led to my room. The darkness of it making it foreign territory to me. I stood in my living room staring down that hall, past the closet, into the void. I was there with my fist clenched and shaking. I was too scared to move, I'm not a fighter. My body wanted to run, but I was too scared to move. I heard a crash in my room that made me jump dropping the knife. 
"" You fucking idiot."" I told myself as I bent down to pick it up my eyes never moving from the door.

But I stupidly grabbed the blade of it and sliced my fingers, my eyes darted towards the pain and in my peripheral I saw it. My damn cat smoky. He was covered in flour and his fur was all messed up. I finally calmed down and finished cleaning up his mess. Patched my hand up and got ready for bed, I decided against the cake. Mom seemed happy enough besides. I flipped the light on seeing my vent cover on the ground. Smoky must have gotten spooked in there and shook the wall. I picked it up and wiped the flour off
 
As I laid down in bed though I thought I heard those echoing knocks again. I brushed them off and  fell into slumber. I woke up that next morning well rested as ever forgetting the whole scare that night. But as I stretched in my bed I looked up mid yawn and saw flour on my wall. I thought Smoky must have jumped up when the vent fell. I fixed it up and was getting ready for my day, the best way to start for me. A hot shower. Tried turning on the fan but it just wasn't kicking on. 

While cleaning up once again those knocks again echoed, I assumed someone was at my door. Maybe Mom was here to cry some more, like the shock of yesterday was finally over. I washed off and shut the shower off. Opening the curtain to the thick steam my bathing created. I stood there drying off and nearly fell back into my shower. A handprint was on my mirror. I stared at it for a good second before getting up to look closer. I placed my hand over it, my hand was bigger not by much but bigger. Maybe I leaned on the glass while getting ready to shower. I mean it was the only thing that could make sense 

I quickly started getting dressed, still a little spooked by everything. Maybe I was just stressing about Grandpa. Maybe this maybe that was all I can ever come up with, I'm never certain on shit. Three knocks again I could hear them better, echoing though the vent. I exited the bathroom and rushed to my front door. Passing Grandpa. I opened it and sure enough there was my Mom.

She was there teary eyed but still smiled when I opened the door. 
""Hey honey, sorry for just dropping by."" 
""As if you need to apologize."" I told her. 
She sat down at the kitchen table, I made her some coffee. She thanked me as she took the mug from me.
"" Much needed baby, I was just up all night going through memories. Found that old box of photos from when you were real little."" She giggled.
""Anything with me and Grandpa?"" I asked
"" Only one from when you were born."" She said as she grabbed her phone, beginning to swipe through the photos. I couldn't help but exclaim,
""Holy shit!"" As she swiped past an image of me in a military uniform. But I was never in the military plus this photo was very old looking. 
"" Oh yeah! I never really noticed before."" She held the phone up next to my head. 
"" You're a spitting image of your Grandfather! Oh hoot your grand dad's old war buddies would get a kick outta that. They'll probably freak at the funeral."" She giggled 

I don't know what was with my mom, her emotions were everywhere it seemed. It was freaking me out bad, it felt like she was forcing herself to be sad. I know that makes no sense at all but her happy side came so quickly and easily. And when she was sad it was only in the beginning of the conversation. My alarm went off on my phone while we were chatting, completely forgot to finish getting ready to open up the restaurant. 

"" Hey mom give me a sec,"" I said turning off my alarm.
""Just gotta grab some stuff.""  I got up and jogged to my room looking for my name tag and apron. I always misplaced my stuff so I was looking for quite a bit. And as I was looking I heard a door slam hard. Made my ears ring. I quickly ran back out and found my mom gone. I went to call her but saw she texted me.

""Had to run sorry! Love ya!"" 
""Well fuck mom you don't gotta slam my door."" I thought to myself. She had done it so hard that the closet opened up a little. I went to close it and saw a little hole in the wall. I moved the door open and noticed the hole was from the handle. Did Mom really swing my closet open that hard and why? It's not like she needed anything from there. Then while shutting the door, thinking about what I had to buy to fix this shit. I saw the box with the prosthetic was gone.

Mom said she didn't have it, I know I couldn't have miss placed it. I only lose small things like my keys or my phone. So then where the fuck is it guys, can anyone explain that? But that was all just the start from there on I kept finding them. The hand prints. First the mirror then when I was cleaning I found some up in corners on my ceiling made of dirt and dust. One morning there was one on the window I sleep next to! It was just smudged right there, and I know it was in my house cause it was like all the rest of them. A smaller size than me and right handed. 

But tonight has been the worst of it all. It's why I'm here why I'm asking for help, for answers maybe. I'm in my room the doors locked. I just wanted to bake a cake again. I just wanted to bake, but the fucking knocks. They don't stop either and they were persistent tonight. And I went to grab my flour again and it was open and prints covered my pantry walls. I gasped and heard the knocking again. It bellowed through my house and ran towards my room. But the knocking was coming from the darkness of it. 

The sensation of fainting ran over me and with it I stumble ran to my bathroom locking the door behind me. I shakily took my phone out and tried to call the cops. I don't know what was happening, but my phone was glitching out way too much to do anything at all. Androids. They aren't too reliable. All I could do was hide out. My bathroom didn't have windows I couldn't go anywhere but out past that door of safety. 

Then whoever was in my house started knocking on the door. Three rapid knocks. Pause. Repeat. Then the pauses became shorter with each minute, becoming a nonstop stampede in my head. After ten minutes, the knocking stopped ; I heard the door knob jiggle softly, then that silence again. I'm not proud but I sat there in my bathtub for a good hour or so before I even considered getting up. Stayed there so long my phone died in my pocket. I reluctantly unlocked the door and pulled it towards me, letting it swing past and smack into the bathroom. Nothing was there, the lights were all off. And no one was there but me. I sighed still shaking, grabbing the knob to close the door, but my hand slipped off. I recognized this feeling; there was flour in my hand. I tried to turn the light on but hit my ac switch. And when it kicked on, it blew from the vent. Flour.
I'm scared, alone in my home, my room. I'll update in the morning. There's knocking on my walls right now. 
Im scared and want to sleep.

We started this playful flirting and I developed a crush. We went for drinks to a mutual friend and ended up cuddling (no sex) and talking for hours. He did not make a sexual move at all and fondled with my hair and caressed my face. After that during work he saw me very stressed and suggested we go for a coffee, there we talked for 4 hours and he brought he topic of what I was looking for, to which I stated I wanted to meet and date someone for a serious relationship, he stated he was looking for the same thing. He mentioned he had been single for years and was looking for something stable. We talked about serious and meaningful topics. After that we went for drinks with mutual friends and ended up making out heavily, I repeated to him again I was not looking for a one night stand or casual thing and he stated he was not either but got physical. We ended up having sex, cuddling all night, he made breakfast form me and took a shower together, we then stayed watching TV and giving each other pop kisses, until I told him I had to leave, I aimed for a goodbye kiss on the cheek but he kissed me on the mouth hugged me and told me to drive safe. The thing is, it has been one day and he has not texted, though he has said several times he is not the texting type. I am not sure I even want to date him to begin with even though I am positive I kind of like him. And a thing that makes me doubt the whole thing is that we work together. But I am curious to get to know him better? Did I ruin everything by sleeping with him too soon? What are your takes on his behavior ?",0,1740363644.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

I knew I had to do it. 

I constructed Frylock from a tuna can box because I didn’t have a fry container on hand, then I got into the art supplies to pull together the other elements. Shake is just construction paper wrapped around a white coffee mug. His pink straw is pink paper wrapped around a metal straw. Absolutely janky. I spent a lot of time chuckling to myself and found the whole process slightly whimsical which is probably a sign I need to do more shitty crafts. 

Master Shake is a vanilla milkshake, even though I’m pretty sure they revealed he was chocolate in one episode. He was also filled with blood in another one, so I honestly felt it was open to interpretation. Frylock is hand cut twice-fried fries. Meatwad is a 1/2 lb baked Italian meatball. I did make a total of four meatballs - the other three got covered in a spicy red sauce. 

Was it weird eating literally a meatball, fries, and a shake for dinner? Yes. But only because they were staring at me judgmentally the whole time. ",32,1740363483.0,52weeksofcooking,2,1.0,False

I know that this isn't specifically cosplay, but I figured you guys would be good at helping me out with this. How would I go about making a realistic coffee cup that's six feet tall with a lid that could detach? It needs to be pretty lightweight and easy ish to make -- no machinery needed etc.

Thanks.

Other girls and people my age, like my best friend who is also 18 like to drink and go to the club. Lots of people live on their own or at a college dorm, making friends their age and being mature. But I still live with my parents and I spend my weekends writing in my journal and organizing my sticker collection. I have lots of plushies and Hello Kitty stuff, almost everything I own is cutesie and pink themed. I find myself to be very easily entertained by taking a walk and looking at squirrels and birds and it makes me very happy. I also dress in clothes that are cutesie and probably immature. My friends (which I do not have very many of) wear heels and skirts and do lots of makeup and stuff and I also want to do these things but I feel like I am wearing a costume if I do it. I feel like a martian. I go to university where my mom is a professor, so in between classes I go in my mom's office with her and eat lunch instead of making effort to talk to other people my age. My therapist has suggested that I might have autism but I don't know how to get that checked out really. I have a job at the University Lab Preschool which doesn't give me much opportunity to make friends with coworkers. My mom suggested to me to change jobs to a coffee shop or restaurant so I can make friends with other girls. I cry a lot because I feel very ""simple"" and different but I fall back into what I think is comfortable. (Being at home with family and having alone time.) My brothers also poke fun at me for not being ""a real adult"" or acting ""like a toddler"" because I watch children's shows or color and use stickers.
