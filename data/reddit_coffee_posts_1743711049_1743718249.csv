Was locked up on bottom shelf and I just assumed was tequila since it said silver. The worker took it up to the registers while I finished shopping, as they do, then brought it to me when I was at self checkout. I just scanned it, didn’t even look at the damn bottle more closely first, then got home and sliced up a lime to enjoy with it. Then turns out it is silver rum, not tequila. Eww. Rum is and Gin are the 2 liquors I dislike the most. Would have taken back but live far away. 

Then I had absolutely nothing to mix it with, no coke or anything. Had coffee left in my coffee pot from this morning so ended up mixing the rum with it over ice. I must say can barely taste the rum going down, but has a terrible rubbing alcohol aftertaste. (No, never drank rubbing alcohol, but you kwim, tastes like rubbing alcohol smells.

I said in another post that the response to her OBGYN rant probably slapped her in the face with the reality that the farce that was the health at every size movement is dead and gone. 

She was planning on mommy vlogging. I’m sure she’d been planning on capitalizing off of her future children for at least the last 5 years and LOL her fat ass couldn’t get pregnant until now when we have JUST recently turned on mommy vlogging and family channels. There goes her plan B on how to pivot her channel. 

Now she’s trying to pivot towards being a health girly pop. But she’s such an idiot that she’s trying to make content that was popular years ago. Healthy junk hacks, no days off, over training, girls focusing solely on getting buff so they can have big muscle butts etc. idk how it is on tik tok. I’m not on tik tok. I’m out in the real world and I talk to multiple clients every day and maybe I’m the one who’s out of touch on this but I think it’s her. It feels to me that we are in a real healthy era. I see people focusing more on calisthenics, Pilates, yoga, cardio and supplementing with weight training rather than just forcing down protein and ego lifting with the only goal being muscle building not long term wellness. I see people eating healthy balanced meals instead of these weird protein swap diet hacks. I see people drinking water, tea, mushroom coffee rather than energy drinks, pre workout, coffee. I see people prioritizing rest and spending time in the sun and fresh air and socializing. I know she’s not working out hard but she’s basically making content that’s stuck in the 20-teens it’s just funny because she can’t do anything right lol she can’t even follow the crowd correctly.

I'm sorry, I've been on 2 decades of just slamming a shitload of coffee grounds in a simple drip coffee machine. Got one of these smart keurig machines that has some BrewID.

I like the machine, everything about it convenience and quality is great for months now.

The only thing is this BrewID will sit there and try to ID the pod (some of the pods I use dont have a QR code, some do) in either case its just far too much time on trying to ID the kcup.

I don't care about any optimizations this feature provides. I just want to sneak into the kitchen during a meeting slam a pod and walk away. But I have to sit here and wait for 20 seconds for this ""feature"" to fail/timeout.

Please for the love of god, just give a way to disable this. Why is there no obvious way to disable this?  
I want to put a pod in, press 12oz, and go. it should take 0 seconds outside of my button presses.

I go through 3-5 pods a day and I get that 20 seconds isn't a big deal. But its annoying. It's a significant portion of the total time to get coffee into my mouth from the time I put the pod in and close the lid.

1jqvnhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1jqvnhg/its_really_over_please_tell_me_your_thoughts/,"It's really over, please tell me your thoughts","Hi everyone, my ex-gf broke up with me at the end of january after 10 months together. It was a difficult time for me, because the reasons of the break up were very little things of my personality and behaviour (i was always sweet and loving, never aggressive or anything). She thought that the relationship was missing communication and trust but only on some trivial aspects.
I explained to her that, to that day, I never thought of that as a problem, it was my normal behaviour and that if given time I would have shown that I could communicate more and all the wromg things I did weren't intentional or were to try to not harm her (innocent lies).
In the end I didn't have the time to show that and she decided to leave me after a heated discussion.

We went NC and after 5 days she texted me asking how I was and if my life was better without her. I responded that i was focusing on myself and that I didn't have an answer.
On valentines day she texted again and asked to meet, we talked about how the relationship ended, that she missed me, loved me and she asked to get back together and I agreed.

The relationship was going fine, i thought the sinergy and chemistry was back, we went on dates. After 18 days together she broke up with me again. This time with a gentle discussion, telling me she didn't felt 100% in the relationship with me, she was disconnected and didn't feel the chemistry, but at the same time she loved me, and for this reason she thought that this relationship would harm me and her, because she was only invested partially in it. She said that this decision was rational, by her head, not by her heart because she still loved me and wanted me; for her this was a hard decision, but the correct one. Went NO Contact after this.

The first break up she was rally angry at me for no reason so it was a little """"easier"""" to digest and also it happened in a week, more slowly, but this time it was gentle but at the same time surreal and happened in a night.

One month later I publish a story on ig and she writes me on ig asking how I am and also if I could give her back the drawings she made for me if I was going to throw them away. I was thinking about her again now... 3 days later I broke NC asking her if we could meet for coffee and that I reflected on my errors and I was going to work on them. She agreed but she wanted to be friends. I told her i didn't want that and she told me that she thought all days about coming back but that the relationship wasn't going to function. That she wasn't feeling the sinergy, that things couldn't go back to normal after the first break up. That her therapist told her the relationship was seen differently by me and by her point of view... That she wasn't the right one for me. That I'm still young and I have a life ahead of me. That I could find someone better than her. That maybe things could work out in 2-3 years, but it isn't right to wait for this. That I am superficial on some things while she is deep with thoughts and care about these topics. That love isn't enough in a relationship. That people don't change. That she didn't saw me change in 1 months by what I wrote today. Etc...

I lived 11 beautiful months, and I don't know how to feel anymore... I'm going to focus on myself, new work, gym, friends, hobby. But I feel like hollow, I don't have the strenght to cry anymore, because this is so surreal...

A last detail: please note that my ex wasn't abusive physically, and was a just aggressive verbally durino the first break up. Before and after that she was ALMOST normal, this is what is standing to me. The signals weren'there, she was diagnosed, taking medicine and startene therapy, but it was like a calma for 10 months and the caos in 1 week. I can't describe it, I'm somehow devastated and at the same time I now have less to worry about...",1,1743717773.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False

He is my best friend and the only person that I love with all my heart. I can't think my life without him. We broke up 4 months ago but I never stopped thinking and loving him. We were together 5 years. We were so in love and tried to build our life together. We got married and starting trying to have a baby. I got pregnant but I had a miscarriage. Then He lost his father and his grandma so we postpone our big church marriage and just did a  small civil marriage. We were so happy and in love with each other but then he had a serious problem with his work so he was having financial problems. I didn’t mind that he couldn’t afford to the house so I supported him psychologically and financially.  He was my partner off-course I would stand by him and I would helped him. It was our house and our family. Then my family had some difficulties and I was really sad but he didn’t supported me. I knew that he wasn’t good psychologically because of the problems but I just wanted him to tell me that everything will be ok , that I will find a way to deal my family problem. I didn’t ask for money. Instead I was invisible, he didn’t care about me and he said that he can’t support me cause he has his own problems and that he wants to focus to his life. I was often alone in the house  as he preferred to hang out with with his friends instead of me , but I never said anything cause I knew that it was a difficult period for him. Meanwhile I started loosing myself, I was alone. I was sad and my role inside the house was to be a housemate. So the last months we started fighting as I confessed to him that i think that he doesn’t love me anymore and that I was dreaming to have a family with him not just to be a housemate. He said that because of his financial problems he doesn’t want to have family anymore so it’s better for me to leave. I told him that I can wait for him to recover so we can continue our life together but he said that he prefers to stay alone . So I left, 4 months ago I left him. Despite the fact that I wanted to stay he asked me to leave. I was so sad without him , I was so  I was so sad that he had to deal his problems alone. We contacted and met 3 times, we had sex once and we kept messaging and calling each other. I saw him one week ago we had a coffee and spend the afternoon together. Today he called me from the hospital. He asked me to go and take his cat from the house. He was diagnosed with thymus cancer. I am lost. We got divorced but he is my friend and my love. All this time I was waiting that he will change his mind and we will try again to save what we had. I know that the last months I was sad next to him cause he was treating me like a ghost but this doesn’t mean that I don’t love him. I want to be next to him to take care of him. I don’t care for what happened in the past . I don’t want to be with him because I feel pity if him. I want to be there because I love him, I never stopped loving him. I asked him if he wants me to go to meet him but he doesn’t want to meet me. He will be transferred to another hospital in few days to start the chemotherapy and probably afterwards he will have a surgery. I want to go with him but he is in denial. Today we spoke all day on the phone and on video calls but I am afraid. I am afraid that he will ask me not to care about him. Off-course I will not do something that he doesn’t want but I can’t just call him on the phone.I want to be next to him to support him with everything. What should I do?

I have spent the last decade of my life with you as the candy apple of my eye. And I know that we've failed each other on multiple levels. I'm not comparing piles of shit, but I'm sure we can both guess whose is bigger. I don't want to point fingers. I don't want to place blame. I simply want to put it all out there, on the table, bare so we can not repeat these cycles we always put ourselves through. So we can write our boundaries down that we agree to and put em on the fridge as our first contract we've made to one another. Hopefully, the second is marriage with the family and everything.

I've got a job like you asked, big check is getting sent out Monday, I'm ready to support you as you did me during my dark times to heal. My birthday is coming up soon and all I want is you for it. That's church, beb. Step up, what I'd honestly prefer, or step off. I have needs in life I have to address and I pray to God you can join me as I fulfill them. It's always been you, nobody else but you.

I'm going to delete this app for good. You told me that it was here that you lost your touch with reality. I have tried tirelessly to get you back in touch with it for months. Much to my own self sacrifice. But ya know what? You're worth it. I've scaled more of your walls and have broken down more of your barriers than anyone else. And if all of my efforts through all of our years together are not worth a call or text to make plans to sit down and hash this out then that's on you. I have to get off of here before I fall victim to the same disassociation that you've professed to me. I love you, and I've never stopped loving you, beb.

As I sip my coffee around good friends and wait to go back out on Saturday, know this. I will always be here for you. It's just that I can't keep waiting for words of affirmation, my primary love language, from you any further. I have to live my own life at some point in time. I have to find new friends, relationships and love that nurtures my growth and betterment. I will thrive, and it will suck not having you by my side to partake in it.

Shit or get off the pot, beb. I think my love, dedication and work have shown enough proof that you can trust me with you. And I mean olive you. I love you morer, and that's a got dam fact.

What should I do?,"So he is and always be the love of my life. He is my best friend and the only person that I love with all my heart. I can't think my life without him. We broke up 4 months ago but I never stopped thinking and loving him. We were together 5 years. We were so in love and tried to build our life together. We got married and starting trying to have a baby. I got pregnant but I had a miscarriage. Then He lost his father and his grandma so we postpone our big church marriage and just did a  small civil marriage. We were so happy and in love with each other but then he had a serious problem with his work so he was having financial problems. I didn’t mind that he couldn’t afford to the house so I supported him psychologically and financially.  He was my partner off-course I would stand by him and I would helped him. It was our house and our family. Then my family had some difficulties and I was really sad but he didn’t supported me. I knew that he wasn’t good psychologically because of the problems but I just wanted him to tell me that everything will be ok , that I will find a way to deal my family problem. I didn’t ask for money. Instead I was invisible, he didn’t care about me and he said that he can’t support me cause he has his own problems and that he wants to focus to his life. I was often alone in the house  as he preferred to hang out with with his friends instead of me , but I never said anything cause I knew that it was a difficult period for him. Meanwhile I started loosing myself, I was alone. I was sad and my role inside the house was to be a housemate. So the last months we started fighting as I confessed to him that i think that he doesn’t love me anymore and that I was dreaming to have a family with him not just to be a housemate. He said that because of his financial problems he doesn’t want to have family anymore so it’s better for me to leave. I told him that I can wait for him to recover so we can continue our life together but he said that he prefers to stay alone . So I left, 4 months ago I left him. Despite the fact that I wanted to stay he asked me to leave. I was so sad without him , I was so  I was so sad that he had to deal his problems alone. We contacted and met 3 times, we had sex once and we kept messaging and calling each other. I saw him one week ago we had a coffee and spend the afternoon together. Today he called me from the hospital. He asked me to go and take his cat from the house. He was diagnosed with thymus cancer. I am lost. We got divorced but he is my friend and my love. All this time I was waiting that he will change his mind and we will try again to save what we had. I know that the last months I was sad next to him cause he was treating me like a ghost but this doesn’t mean that I don’t love him. I want to be next to him to take care of him. I don’t care for what happened in the past . I don’t want to be with him because I feel pity if him. I want to be there because I love him, I never stopped loving him. I asked him if he wants me to go to meet him but he doesn’t want to meet me. He will be transferred to another hospital in few days to start the chemotherapy and probably afterwards he will have a surgery. I want to go with him but he is in denial. Today we spoke all day on the phone and on video calls but I am afraid. I am afraid that he will ask me not to care about him. Off-course I will not do something that he doesn’t want but I can’t just call him on the phone.I want to be next to him to support him with everything. What should I do? I can’t believe how our life became like that. I can’t believe what is happening. I just want him to be healthy and happy. ",1,1743717189.0,CancerFamilySupport,0,1.0,False

I found myself walking through the woods. The trees whispered to each other, rustling leaves in hushed conversations, their limbs stretching toward the sky like eager listeners. I wasn’t sure how I got here or where I was going. The air smelled of honey and something oddly metallic, like rusted gears turning beneath the earth. In the distance, voices floated on the wind, cheerful yet unsettling. I walked toward them.

Emerging from the dense foliage, I stumbled upon a clearing dominated by a ridiculously long table piled high with plates and cakes of every imaginable variety. Some had been ravaged into crumbs, others leaned precariously, defying gravity. In the center of the madness, perched daintily on a velvet cushion, was my cat. But she wasn’t just my cat anymore. She was dressed like a young girl, complete with a bowtie in her long, golden locks. Locks? Since when did she have hair?

Before I could wrap my head around that impossibility, a voice from the left end of the table pulled my attention.

“Ah, you’ve finally arrived!”

I turned to see my dog, Rufus. Only, he wasn’t just a dog anymore. He was standing upright, dressed in a tuxedo with a long, tall hat, rounded sunglasses perched on his snout. With his shaggy fur and groovy demeanor, he reminded me of a 1960s hippie professor.

“Perhaps you would like to play catch?” he suggested in a dry British accent that sounded as if it had been plucked straight from a Shakespearean drama. He giggled suddenly, a sound so unnatural coming from him that it made my skin prickle. “I was kidding. Perhaps a cup of tea for the birthday boy?”

“It’s not my birthday,” I said, shaking my head.

“Oh,” Rufus replied, sounding more disappointed than surprised. Before he could continue, an odd noise filled the air, like someone blowing raspberries but with the authority of a royal decree.

I turned to see a plump, overripe grape at the far end of the table, balancing atop a trembling tower of smaller grapes. A golden crown teetered on her wrinkled forehead. The Queen. Of course. She flapped her long, droopy lips furiously, but all that came out were those ridiculous flapping noises.

No one responded. She tried again, this time with more gusto. Silence. Finally, after much struggle, she motioned for her guards—small, grape-like minions with spears—to carry her away. Unfortunately, they couldn't understand her commands either. Instead, they began whispering instructions to each other in a long, drawn-out game of telephone. By the time the last guard received the message, he passed it back to the previous one, and so on, until they were all facing in the same direction as before. The Queen, exhausted, gave up and flopped over onto her back, arms splayed out in dramatic resignation.

Just when I thought things couldn’t get any stranger, Rene Descartes appeared, standing at the table’s edge. He lifted a thoughtful finger. “I think, therefore I am,” he declared.

Across from him, Brittle, a robot from *Sea of Rust*, stood up, mirroring his gesture. “I am, therefore I think.”

Descartes blinked. Then, grinning, he grabbed a massive cake, stuffing an unreasonable amount into his mouth. He immediately began choking. Brittle, rolling her glowing eyes, performed the Heimlich maneuver with an efficiency only a machine could manage. The cake shot out, landing squarely on the Queen of Grapes, who merely flapped her lips in protest.

Rufus clapped. “Frisbee golf, anyone?”

From the far end of the table, a massive caterpillar, nearly the size of my cat, raised a tiny, green hand. “I will,” it rasped.

Rufus tossed the frisbee, and it landed perfectly in one of the caterpillar’s many outstretched hands. “Good boy!” Rufus cheered. “Now, bring it back.”

The caterpillar nodded, then started crawling across the table. It was slow. Painfully slow. We waited, some more patiently than others, as it inched its way toward us. As it drew nearer, I noticed it was wearing a ragged cloth over its head, and its red eyes glowed under the dim light. Smoke curled lazily from one of its hands.

“Are you smoking marijuana?” I asked.

The caterpillar took an eternity to stop, overshooting slightly before shuffling backward. It stared at me, as if forming thoughts took more effort than usual.

“No, man,” it finally croaked. “Marijuana is illegal. I only smoke *ganja*.”

It smiled, as if recalling some private joke.

Before I could respond, Albert Einstein materialized beside me. But he wasn’t wearing his usual suit or lab coat. Instead, he reclined in a beach chair, donning a bright floral bathing suit, sipping a cocktail with a tiny umbrella.

“Time,” he said, swirling his drink, “is not a river flowing forward while you stand in it.” He pointed his straw at me. “Instead, think of time as a dense fog. You move through it, but it stays still. When you measure time, you’re not watching it move—you’re simply marking the spots where you’ve been and where you wish to go.”

I opened my mouth to respond, but the world around me began to blur, melting like wet paint. The Queen of Grapes deflated with a sigh, the caterpillar's eyes swirled like a hypnotic spiral, and Rufus started playing air guitar with an invisible instrument. Descartes was wrestling Brittle for the last piece of cake, and Einstein raised his glass in a silent toast as everything collapsed into a whirlwind of color and sound.

Suddenly, I jerked awake.

I was at my desk, my hands on my keyboard, my screen filled with an endless stream of half-written words. The dream, the madness—it was gone. But was it?

I glanced down. A small, round grape sat beside my coffee cup, a tiny golden crown perched on its wrinkled top.

I reached out. It flapped its lips at me.

Things in my living situation have gotten super tense, and I feel like I'm being iced out for trying to have an honest conversation. The worst part? I want to take over the lease in a few months-but the current leaseholder refuses to speak to me.

Here's the breakdown:

I'm 25F and live in a 3-bedroom house with two other women, Roommate #1 (25F, leaseholder) and Roommate #2 (21F). I was the last to move in, about a month later than the others. At first, I was actually getting to be pretty close with RM#1, she came off very easygoing and we seemed to click well. Meanwhile, she didn't really click with RM#2 at first (before I moved in), and started blaming her for a lot of the house issues - calling her lazy, messy, etc.

Over time, though, I started to feel differently. One major issue was the cat situation: RM#2 had two cats, and RM#1 has one. The cats didn't get along, so one of RM#2's cats was confined to her room, and the other was kept only on the 1st floor. Meanwhile, RM#1's cat was allowed to roam the entire house freely, including shared spaces. This caused major fights between the cats, which got so bad that RM#2 had to send her downstairs cat back to her parents' house for its own safety. RM #1 refused to make any compromises or restrict her cat's access, even though it was clearly contributing to the issue.

What made this worse is that RM#1 already has the entire 3rd floor to herself, - a bedroom, bathroom, and private office/closet area. She has the most space and privacy in the house, yet still acted entitled to all the common areas too. On top of that, the litter box for the downstairs cat was left filthy and reeked (I tried to wait them out to avoid cleaning it, but it had been 2 weeks and the cat started going on the floor) and RM#1 would constantly blame RM#2 for it- while doing nothing to help.

Eventually, I got to know RM#2 better and found out she had been going through a bout of depression. Still, she was coming home from overnight shifts and cleaning the kitchen every morning - something that RM #1 was taking credit for. That's when I realized RM#1 has been misrepresenting her and trying to manipulate the household dynamic.

Things kept piling up. RM#1 decorated the entire shared living room without asking or informing us, and it looked incredibly tacky and cluttered. To boot, she would always veto our suggestions for things to put in the shared spaces, and wanted everything ran past her. She also bought a real Christmas tree without running it by, even though I'm highly allergi**c**\- and of course, I ended up being the one who had to clean up after it, on top of doing the majority of the cleaning in general. She also constantly tried. to force a certain vibe in the house - like insisting we throw parties for every holiday, even when I clearly wasn't into it. I would be polite and help out where I could, but I didn't want to invite friends (most of mine are busy and live far). She got upset that I wasn't actively hyping things up or bringing people, and made me feel bad for just existing more quietly in the space.

Around the holidays, I found out I could work remotely, so I went to stay at my family's cabin for a few weeks, that turned eventually into a few months to get away from it. I was still paying rent and bills on time, and all the like, and kept in touch. While I was gone, I found out RM#1 never actually set up our utility accounts, even though I was asking about it months earlier. She then Venmo requested us for utilities-including a split late fee of $200 for her own mistake.

After all of this, and some encouragement from friends, I finally sent RM#1 a calm and respectful text. I said I didn't feel like I truly lived there - it felt more like I was a guest in her home - and that I was considering putting my things in a storage and looking for a 1-bedroom if nothing changed. I wasn't trying to start a fight, I just wanted to open the door to a real conversation.

She never responded.

Now, my money got funny, and I'm back at the house, and things are worse than ever. She won't speak to me at all. Full-on cold shoulder. On top of that, I found out she removed my access to our Ring security camera on the front porch. I've had packages stolen, so I really relied on that. I texted her asking for access again and offered to meet for coffee and talk- I even said I'd apologize, just to clear the air and move forward peacefully.

Still nothing.

Here's the kicker:

Both roommates are moving out in August, and I want to take over the lease. But RM #1 is the only one on the lease, and she's refusing to communicate. I don't want drama- I just want to handle this like an adult. But she's completely shut me out and is making everything as uncomfortable as possible.

My husband recently admitted to having an affair. We’re trying to work through it, and he claims he loves me and wants to fix things. During the affair, he confided in his friend Mark, who knew everything. Meanwhile, Mark was still around me—at birthdays, gatherings, even in our home—acting completely normal while covering for my husband’s lies.  

I’m not blaming Mark for staying silent (that’s on my husband), but I do think it was shitty of him to play along like nothing was happening. I told my husband that I’m not ready to see Mark right now, but I haven’t demanded he cut ties or confront him.  

Here’s the issue: Twice in the past week, my husband has left the house without telling me and met up with Mark for coffee and a walk. The first time, I freaked out—it felt triggering, like more sneaky behavior. We had a huge fight but moved past it. Then he did it *again*. This time, I waited a few hours and calmly said I’d have preferred a heads-up before, not after.  

He completely lost it—accused me of being unreasonable, having a ""thing"" about Mark, and told me to ""get over myself."" I tried explaining that while Mark is part of it, the secrecy is just as hurtful, especially given his history of deception. Cue another massive argument.

The Tragic Tale of Angry Andy

There once was a man named Andy. Angry Andy, they called him—not behind his back, no. To his face. Always to his face. Because if you didn’t call him Angry Andy, he’d assume you were insulting him, and then he’d throw a traffic cone at your car, or maybe kick your mailbox into a different zip code.

Andy was always pissed off. Like, violently furious over the smallest things. Spill coffee? Flip the table. Drop his sandwich? Suplex the fridge. See someone smile? That’s a roundhouse kick with a side of profanity.

He once punched a goose because it honked too close to his ear.

He once got banned from five Walmarts in the same week because the carts kept sticking together and he lost it, tossing them like javelins across the parking lot.

His worst enemy? Vending machines. He had scars on his knuckles and a deep, personal vendetta against anything that accepted quarters. One day, a Snickers got stuck. Andy screamed so loud the machine short-circuited. He got electrocuted, sued the vending company, lost, and then punched the lawyer’s tie in half.

But it wasn’t just people and machines. No, the world itself seemed to have it out for him. It rained when he wore suede. Every pizza he ordered showed up cold, every single time. He once got mugged by a mime. A mime.

People laughed. “That’s just Angry Andy,” they’d say. “Always mad, always fighting.”
But they never asked why.

⸻

You see, Andy wasn’t born angry. He was born Andrew Thompson. Bright-eyed, a little quiet, and completely obsessed with drawing superheroes. He wanted to be a comic book artist. But life… well, life was a bully with brass knuckles and no sense of humor.

His dad left early, his mom worked three jobs, and Andy spent most of his childhood dodging eviction notices and eating cereal with water. Every time he tried to share his drawings, some punk kid would tear them up. One time, a teacher even laughed and said, “Maybe focus on something you’re actually good at.”

So, Andy stopped drawing.

He started yelling.

It got him attention, at least. And people don’t laugh when you’re furious. They fear you. He liked that. It felt like control. Like maybe the world wouldn’t roll him over again if he kept his fists up and his voice louder than the pain.

⸻

But one day, Andy got into a fight at a gas station—some guy cut in line. It turned into a brawl. Andy threw a can of oil. The guy hit his head on a pump.

He didn’t die, but he was messed up bad.

Andy got arrested.

And in that cell, for the first time in twenty years, he cried. Not angry tears. Just tired ones. Because he didn’t even know what he was fighting anymore. The world? Himself? The ghosts of a life that never loved him back?

He stared at the wall for hours.

Then, with a stubby pencil and the back of a ticket stub, he started to draw.

A hero.
With fists like thunder.
Eyes full of fire.
But a broken heart beneath the mask.

It was the first thing he’d drawn in years.

And for a moment, Andy wasn’t angry.

He was just… Andy.

Quiet. Small. Sad.

But finally, real.

⸻

No one talks about Angry Andy anymore. He’s just Andrew now. He teaches art to kids at the community center. Helps them draw their own heroes.

He still gets mad sometimes—especially when the vending machine eats his change.

But now, instead of punching it, he just sighs…

But I still sense I’m being targeted.,"I hope it’s ok to post here. I respect you all. I want to make your jobs easier. And I want to be left in peace. I am a woman with depression/anxiety. 

I used to shop a lot. Shopping was an unhealthy escape. I’ve worked very hard in therapy to develop skills, and have come a long way. My depression is gone but I still have anxiety. However, my anxiety treatment has come a long way, and I’m much better than I was years ago. 

I wasn’t always nice to retail staff decades ago, because I was frustrated and angry at myself for not understanding my overshopping and my  anxiety. Thank goodness that was a very old version of myself that feels like a lifetime ago, and is not who I am at my core.

I never stole anything. I never had any thoughts to steal anything. That’s just not who I am. I’m a law abiding citizen.

I don’t enjoy shopping. It was never “retail therapy” or “a hobby”. I hate shopping because it’s overwhelming, there are too many choices, I don’t know what to get, etc. It all makes me so anxious. And then when the anxiety would hit, my ability to think things through would get worse. I would buy too much, and then once home, I’d think things through and then realize what I shouldn’t have purchased. Back to the store for returns. I hate making returns, because I was extremely embarrassed and ashamed, and so I’d become very anxious at the return counter and feel badly that the store employee had to deal with me. 

Sometimes I’d chat with the store employees while shopping, and that just made things more pleasant, hopefully for both of us. Sometimes I’d ask them their opinion which would help me make a decision. My anxiety would usually decrease after a friendly interaction. Years ago, I would sometimes get over chatty due to my anxiety, but self-awareness solved that embarrassing thing.

I know how awful I must appear when my anxiety hits. That then fills me with shame, I get angry at myself, and the cycle repeats. I’ve made a lot of progress lately, and if I’m feeling anxious, I don’t run any errands, or I just leave the store. Or I sip a hot coffee and focus on that. 

I’ve recently started a low dose anxiety medication, and it’s made a world of difference. I’m eager to tell my doctor. I’m calmer when shopping, I can concentrate better and think things through more while shopping. I feel less overwhelmed in stores from all the choices, and even crowds don’t bother me as much. I’m much more careful with not over buying, and my returns have gone down a lot. 

I’m honest when I return something. If it’s not open and I changed my mind, I say that. If I tried something but it tasted spoiled, I say that. If I tried something on, took the tag off because I wanted to keep it but then changed my mind, and it wasn’t worn, I say that. But I think my anxiety with having to make returns may make staff think I’m lying, which then vamps up my anxiety even more. It’s a terrible cycle. I am respectful, friendly, and polite to the staff. But I get more anxious when I realize they’re likely  misunderstanding my anxiety.

If I’m past the return date, I get upset at myself for letting that happen. Fortunately that hasn’t happened in many years, since my anxiety has improved a lot over the years. I used to have a purse full of receipts, was completely unorganized, and I’d get anxiety from the embarrassment of not being able to organize my receipts better. I hated having to take up the staff members time, and I wish I was more organized. 

Over the past few years, as my anxiety and shopping have decreased with to my hard work in therapy, (it’s exhausting and expensive, but I want to keep improving), one of my favorite things to do now, is compliment staff to their bosses, online surveys, or calling customer service. It’s my small way of trying to make things right for being a pain to deal with in the past.

One thing is still bothering me, however, and I don’t know why it’s happening and what to do. I have a strong sixth-sense, and I’ll be out running errands, not feeling anxious, minding my own business, when I get a very strong sense that sometime in particular is watching me. Sometimes it’s in their behavior. Sometimes it’s just a sense. One time recently, I contacted store security myself. 

As a woman, I try to be vigilant, and aware of my surroundings, my purse, wallet and phone, etc. It’s unnerving to be minding my own business and suddenly get a sixth sense about someone. I will usually leave the store. But I cannot tell if it’s store security or someone else that I would need to report to the police.

I’ve tried in the past to talk with a store security guard, but my anxiety I think made me misunderstood, because sometimes I talk on and on when I’m anxious, which might make me look guilty? I don’t know. It’s ironic and it makes me feel defeated like it’s hopeless. I think I keep thinking I’m being watched because my anxiety must check all the boxes or something.

I respect you all for doing your job. I know the more I work on my anxiety, the easier it is for everyone. But each time I feel like I’m being monitored, that triggers my anxiety. 

I don’t know what to do. I tried switching to online so you all wouldn’t have to deal with my anxiety, but online shopping is more difficult for decision making because you can’t see the item in person. 

This was difficult to write and put out there. But I’m glad I was able to, because it’s a reminder to myself how well I’m doing with treating and taking responsibility for my anxiety. I wish the stigma would end. I likely would’ve taken the anxiety meds as suggested, a lot sooner if the stigma wasn’t out there. I was in denial for quite a while about my anxiety. I just want to live my life and be left alone. I’m trying hard not to let anxiety cause any issues. 

What suggestions do you have?

If I can answer any questions, I’m happy to do so in return.

My partner and I are planning our wedding next year and working with the venue coordinator who recently sent us a detailed offer for their wedding package. The essentials are already covered—ceremony, cocktail reception, set up/rentals, dinner, drinks (beer/wine/soft drinks/coffee), service, etc., and we’re pretty much at our budget already. The venue offered some optional add-ons, and I’m trying to figure out if any of them are actually worth it, or if we’d just be paying for stuff we won’t care about on the day. Like will these things really improve the experience?

We’re middle-class and covering most of the wedding ourselves, so I am trying to stick to the budget. The venue is out of town, so we can't DIY much.

**Decor package (\~$1,620):** Includes fabric/floral arch, aisle décor, bouquet-style arrangements, gift/buffet table styling, candles, etc. Price depends on the scale of work.

Honestly, I wasn’t planning to do much decoration to begin with, mostly just to save money. The venue is already beautiful, and I’m not interested in paying for elaborate floral arrangements. A few DIY florals here and there would probably be enough for me. But now I’m wondering if negotiating a scaled-back version of their decor package might be worth considering.

**Ceremony carpet ($270):** it will be an outdoor ceremony and they basically just lay a carpet down the aisle to walk on instead of the gravel. Feels a bit unnecessary.

**Summer lounge setup ($150)** Kind of considering this one... Cushions and fairy lights on the entrance steps. Could be cute for photos or chilling outside later, but not sure how much it would actually get used.

**Ambient lighting ($215)** Literally just some colored mood lighting for the indoor dinner area. Not sure we need it. But I'm also ""big-light"" hater.

**Midnight snack ($10.25/person):** Different options, e.g., charcuterie boards or hot dogs. We’ll already have a full buffet dinner, apps during cocktail hour, and desserts, so I’m not sure people will be hungry again. If so we can just order a pizza.

Does stuff like this even matter? I’m leaning toward cutting most (if not all) of these extras, but I’m also  (unreasonably) nervous that if I push back on too much they’ll think we’re being cheap asses and stop being as accommodating or flexible with us.

TLDR: I feel like the venue is just upselling stuff into the offer to make it more lucrative lol. Let me know your thoughts!",1,1743716574.0,weddingplanning,3,1.0,False

Ugh, I just wasted like 4 hours of my life on a stupid race condition bug. Tried everything - debuggers, littering my code with console.logs, even git bisect which is always a last resort for me. The damn thing turned out to be a missing dependency in a useEffect array that was causing this weird closure problem. Classic React nonsense.

So after banging my head against the wall and nearly rage-quitting, I stumbled on this **debugging tool** called [Sider](https://sider.ai/invited?c=9d15b818c567092002620c3b5d0ba48f). It's an AI assistance. I'm a complete noob If it comes to AI and these things so. anybody with more knowledge? **Quick note**: the tool operates on a credit system, and if you use the invite link, you’ll receive additional credits to get started (and yes, I also benefit and get more credits). The more credits you have, the more tasks you can accomplish. **But honestly it saved my ass so I figured others might find it useful too.**

The thing that kinda blew me away:

* It actually looked at how my components were talking to each other, not just isolated files
* Gave me a straight answer about the race condition instead of some vague BS
* Pointed right to the missing dependency in like 5 minutes when I'd been stuck for hours

**Anyone else found good tools for them dirty bugzzz?(:** Especially curious if you've got something better for these weird timing/state issues. What do you all do when you're stuck on something ?

I wish that I could transfer my life to someone else

I always had an internal wish that I could just transfer or give my life to someone who was passing on that desperately wanted to live; a flatlining mother who wanted to see her kids again, a child succumbing to a terrible rare disease that wants to be a baseball player when they grow up, A person with a trip to Paris on their bucket list, but didn’t get to see it in time.

In school, I remember reading this Sci-Fi book called *Unwind.* It was about the aftermath of a war fought over reproductive rights. A compromise was reached, where parents could sign their children off to be “unwound” at age 13, i.e. have their body parts harvested for future use. There was a quote that resonated with me at the very beginning of the book. “I was never going to amount to much anyway, but now, statistically speaking, there’s a better chance that some part of me will go on to greatness somewhere in the world. **I’d rather be partly great then entirely useless.**” That last part always got to me.

I was born 3 months prematurely, which led to a mild physical disability in one of my arms. It’s noticeably shorter than the other and much of the muscle mass that was in it had to be scraped away like fat trimmings. While it wasn’t unusable, I still couldn’t do some tasks like a normal child would. When I first learned to write, I did it on a slanted board almost like an easel. I couldn’t support my own weight if I hung from playground equipment, and there were some gym class activities that I had to sit out of.

Oddly enough, it wasn’t the physical stuff that affected me the most. It was the mental side of things most of the time. I always had an inkling that something was wrong with me since I was little. I either made too much eye contact, or too little, I often found myself daydreaming too often, and I was too sensitive. I remember my Kindergarten teacher being my first real school bully. I was belittled for every mistake, micromanaged, singled out, and screamed at to the point of tears.

 I always felt different, and I think others perceived me that way too. It was always, “that kid’s too quiet; he’s weird; he’s a complete idiot.” For a while, I believed them. I never really got the best grades, the teacher could’ve been writing math on the board in Mandarin, and it still wouldn’t have made a difference. My grades stunk until midway through my sophomore year of high school. I excelled in my English classes, and I had a math tutor that explained thing in a way I could understand. My GPA shot up from a 2.7 to a 4.0 my junior year. Many people were happy with me and supportive, but there were always the others that acted like “why does this conceited prick think he’s so smart all of a sudden?”

I went on to college and graduated with a 3.9 overall. I even had a job lined up in my field of study (Comm. and Journalism, that’s totally useful, right?). Finally, it felt like I proved all those classmates and teachers wrong. I *was* smart enough, and I *could* do it.

Things took a turn when that dream job became a nightmare. I made less there than at the retail job I’d left to take it. I was overworked, handling the duties of an entire media team while my efforts were constantly scrutinized. I stretched myself to the point of insomnia, stress nosebleeds, and burnout, but somehow, I wasn’t a team player because I couldn’t stretch myself out just *that* much further. I eventually left for a more relaxed customer service job, which led to a marketing internship. However, I was frequently pulled away from the internship to cover staffing gaps and help a manager that didn’t know mouse shit from coffee grinds. The promise of a full-time position was dangled over my head, so I figured I’d just embrace the suck for a while. When said full-time position finally came up, I was never notified about it. By the time I applied, it was given to someone else. I took that to mean they had someone else in mind from the get-go. If I did something wrong or was just shit at my job, I wish they would’ve just told me. I was expected that I’d just crawl back to the department that overworked me like a good little invertebrate. I put in my two weeks’ notice (with nothing else lined up), so both positions ended at the same time.

Since then, I’ve been working low-paying jobs. I ended up taking a job in a mailroom. They were the only job that said yes to me after months of applying and I needed the money.

 I spent a year doing an accredited Paralegal certification while working. It honestly hasn’t been worth the time or effort. I called various law firms inquiring about positions, even ones for secretaries, and I was turned down. The one that did have an open position, told me they were looking for someone that was bilingual, on top of having the cert. I almost threw my phone against the wall after the call ended.

So now I’m officially stuck. I’m hesitant to go back to school and just shell out more cash for a degree that’s going to leave me high and dry again. I could quit my job, but I’d probably end up in some call center or back in CS. That to me, sounds like trading a rough road for a rougher one. I can’t go into the military, because if my arm doesn’t keep me out, the anti-depressants that I’m taking sure would.

If I could give my life to someone who truly wanted to hold onto theirs, I’d do it. A kid, a mom, somebody who’s worth something gets to stay, and a classic fuck-up gets to leave. It’s an even trade. When all the small victories have led to a dead end and the pattern is likely to continue, it doesn’t seem worth it. It’s like a bowling pin getting knocked down and reset. If someone out there still had a bit of fight left in them, wouldn’t it make more sense for them to have this time instead?

I’ve had 3 kids in 5 years (yes, I know). Currently 9 months postpartum with my third. I was 135lbs before kids and never had any weight issues. I gained 40lbs with my first kid, another 10 with my second, and was thankfully able to maintain my weight with my third. But the weight feels impossible to lose. My diet and eating habits have basically remained the same. I’m definitely not as active as I used to be. I average some light exercise about two days a week (not great I know). 
I just don’t know what I could do better at food wise. I don’t drink soda or any sugary drinks. I drink water, coffee with a splash of whole milk, and an occasional alcoholic beverage. Breakfast I will either have nothing, or sourdough/whole wheat toast. Lunch is often two eggs with half an avocado or beans and avocado. Dinner is the worst because my kids love pasta so we have pasta a decent amount with a side of salad/veggies, or we’ll have bean tacos or a protein like chicken or pork chops or fish/veggie/starch like rice or mashed potatoes. I don’t snack. We will get takeout like once a week, if that, but I cook everything else at home. I’ve counted my calories and I average 1700-2000 a day which I guess is maintenance. 
I know I should exercise more, but what can I tweak in my diet without being absolutely miserable? The only thing I can think of is maybe sneaky things like butter and oil. Because the scale isn’t budging. I think about food all the time and how I’m probably eating too much/the wrong things. I just feel so uncomfortable in my skin and hate how I look in my clothes.

So in an attempt to excuse the numerous grammatical errors hereinafter, an now having re-wrote,  I'll simply Title: The Man in the Room... With that...

Hey Guys. This got long as they all do, but is real life. All true, an just seems to ""happen"" to me. Okay prerequisites first,  I'm going up there to see her again. But having arrived late, only to find she's out for another test. Not even a bed in the room, and I can't explain how much I can't stand Hospital rooms! Simply refuse to sit in one when empty. So I go for a walk, take a stroll as it were.  Will most likely just wonder unguided, phone in hand until I meet another warm body or the end of a hallway. No... I expect to find myself pacing like always... On today's random journey I find myself in another building. In an unfamiliar part of the complex. At some point I'll pass a common area, completely absorbed I'll look up. She'll say, Do you need help finding where you're going ? I'll reply, No honestly I'm just taking a walk, but thanks anyways. Simply continued on my way. I Find myself groggily approaching a coffee bar, but alas it's closed for lunch. Think to myself, there is another, although quite a walk I'll just go back an retrace my steps. Like that I turn around and just continue on my journey... Now I pass the same young woman. Again sitting in the same chair. She says to me, still wandering I see? I reply, actually I found myself in need of a cup of coffee and that place is closed sadly. She replies, Actually! That's me, I'm on break right now. I said, In that case, as you can tell I've no where to be, I'll simply grab a seat and wait for you to finish. To keep this from going on till eternity. I'll simply say, We started off as two complete strangers. Began to learn that we were both experiencing a difficult moment, then would begin to bond over conversation. Now while most is of a personal nature and won't be shared. Importantly she'll mention her father is in this same hospital, and apparently... Is in bad shape. Not quite far from where my mother is currently housed. Now while finishing her meal. She'll ask me, How do you take your coffee? Wait for my reply, clean her mess and depart...
I'll catch up with her. Her coffee stand now open, she's prepared my expresso, My mother's Grande drip. Now fishing my wallet I'll simply ask, How much do I owe you? Her reply will unknowingly change the course my first pleasant morning in days... ""Oh you don't owe me. It's on me today""... Abashed, but knowing it would be rude of me to decline. I simply accept and start looking for the tip jar instead. Now the anger starts to come back. There isn't one to be Found?!?! Against ""company policy"". I could write a novel on this subject alone but now isn't the time. Im trying to tell a story after all, so back to it.
But now. Now I'm stuck! And simply don't know what to do, I mean in my book this is just unacceptable. The situation, Must be rectified somehow! But Alas, all I can do, simply apologize, Blush and ask her name. I'll Introduce myself and we'll simply part ways. Now this! Is Not Satisfactory! I don't want to be angry again. That was yesterday, I've been There! And have thankfully come down some by now. I.E. I don't need this shit right now. But fortunately, and as oftentimes will manage to save my rather hairy behind... An idea occurs... An outlandish idea At that... But I'm forgetting key details already. Her name. Was Nikki or Nicole? And worse yet,  her Father. Was it Bruce or Bernard?  No if I'm to follow through with my plan this will all be of critical importance. Last key detail, her father is in Isolation. And this, Certainly! Won't be easy, if at all possible. But determined none the less I make my way to up the ward, approach the nurse's station. Get a quick run down of the details, the rules of this floor. I tell her my story. Nutshelled far better that this, What I'd like to do, and the fact that the gentleman in question is a stranger to me. Now to my complete surprise... It all worked... She was touched, and quickly guided me over to decontamination to begin the process. I think she might have violated a rule herself... Now I'm not kidding here. I knew what I was getting into. Or so I thought anyways. At least twenty minutes later I'm ready. Looking like I'm going perform surgery myself. Guys!?! I'm talking, I had expected the hair net. But had failed to anticipate the beard guard. Or! The track-less booties, or the level of hand washing required. For what was originally supposed to be such a simple task. But now, as geared up as anyone could be. I'm escorted to this gentleman's room, but will have to keep my distance. Rules have been explained, and I'll abide. Now I walk into the room... 
It becomes quite obvious to me this Gentleman. Is Not! Doing well...  Now all this effort, all this time so I could have this moment... and then it occurs to me... I've forgotten something. Overlooked a crucial detail, one that threatens to unravel my carefully laid plan. I realize... I've no idea what I gonna to say to him... I mean it was such a simple idea. If you can't thank her properly? Then go... Thank him instead. But alas in my haste to get up here I'd forgotten to actually come up with something to say... Past, ""You have wonderful daughter"" to which I'd derived while riding the elevator. But now Im here and it's too late. Suddenly time would slow. I'd examine the room. You see I've developed a thick callus shielding me from this place. So I drop my defenses, let it take me. The soft bustle in the hallway. The chirps of various instruments, combined with the sounds of a of a labored breath... The smells take me next,  A combination of industrial strength cleaner mixed with human decay. Finally I'll open my eyes. Only to find myself unprepared for the sheer number of wires, tubes, and hoses that snake around this gentleman, connecting his life to the various machines, I can only assume are there to sustain him . I'll meet his eye and am only returned a thousand yard stare, to which any use of modern vernacular will fail to adequately convey. No his gaze just rips through me, and I'm frozen. Having lost my purpose, I find my steadfast determination quickly fleeting. All that occurred in a moment's time.  But now. Now something takes over. Again a simple thought. Put yourself in his shoes, in that bed. Your last days... Final hours on this Earth... What would you be thinkin? What would you want to hear? Without conscious effort I find my feet are bringing me closer... I'll approach said Gentlemen. Making sure he's aware of my presence and can hear me, and the following just sort of fell out of my mouth. ""Sir You and I have never met Sir. Simply put, I got to meet your daughter Nicole this morning, and I Believe your name is Bernard. Sir I simply came up here to congratulate you. On what a wonderful kind-hearted and beautiful woman that your daughter has become, and to let you know. You did an amazing job helping her become that Woman. So much so, a complete stranger felt the need to go through all this, I'll jester to the garb im wearing. Just to be able to tell you face-to-face. If you are about to meet your end?  You may rest easy, knowing you did it! And because of your efforts, she'll be just fine after your gone""... then I  Then I awoke. Guys, He just broke down, I'm talking major tears. The the water works, whole nine yards. I wasn't going for That! Hadn't expected this?!? He desperately wanted to give me a hug. Asked, begged the nurse for a simple hand shake. But to no avail. Rules, It was to the Point, I was getting uncomfortable. So I just repeated ""Sir I Thank You an I gotta go"" and would simply turn an leave.  While I walked I could only wonder, Was that right? I mean, what did I just do to him?  Doubt has me now, I guess I'll just go walk it off too... While I do hope I was able to find an old man a bit of comfort. No simply I couldn't tip her and it simply bothered me! That Much! 
So with that long-winded tale behind me. I'll leave you for now, and can only wonder what my coffee will be like tomorrow.

The ""words"" just aren't flowing today... No I'm sitting here... In this room, an every hospital's got one. You've probably passed it once or twice yourself. This one's called Colwell Chapel, and I've no idea what I am doing here. How do you catholics do that again? North South East West. I think? No... This shit ain't me...

Eu sempre quis provar mais cafés, diferentes roasters, origens, processos, etc mas além do constrangimento monetário, há o constrangimento de ter muito café e não lhe dar vazão.

O que proponho é encomendar 5-10 sacos de café de um torrador específico, dividir cada café em porções de 50g (este valor é totalmente aberto a discussão) e cada participante iria receber uma dose de 50g de cada um dos cafés comprados.

Aqui a ideia é ter vários cafés para provar a preços mais acessíveis. De bónus podia gerar discussões interessantes entre nós sobre os cafés.

Podíamos fazer encomendas mensais ou a cada dois meses, ou três meses ou com a regularidade que nos parecer bem. Para começar iríamos encomendar uma vez e ver como corre.

Os torradores em específico está aberto a discussão, bem como o tipo de torra, etc.

A nível de custos além do preço do café + portes até cá, acresce o re-embalamento em porções mais pequenas (creio que se gaste menos de um euro por encomenda) e os portes extra até ao destino (acho que fica a baixo dos 4€).

A nível de trabalho é dividir tudo, embalar e enviar. Eu não me importo de o fazer, ou pode ser uma coisa rotativa.

Digamos que vamos fazer a encomenda para o mês que vem, dia 1 de Maio. Quem está interessado?

Todo o tipo de sugestões são bem vindas!

Bons cafés!

# Rancilio Silvia Pro (2025): Is It REALLY Worth The Upgrade? Review & Alternatives

The Rancilio Silvia has long been a darling of home baristas, offering a taste of professional espresso brewing without breaking the bank. Now, with newer iterations like the Rancilio Silvia Pro and perhaps a 2025 model on the horizon, the question arises: is this upgrade really worth the investment? This in-depth review will explore the features, benefits, and potential drawbacks of the Rancilio Silvia Pro (with a look towards what a 2025 model might entail), helping you decide if it’s the right espresso machine for your needs. We'll also cover some worthy alternatives in case the Silvia Pro isn't the perfect fit.

[[Explore Top Rated rancilio silvia pro on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=rancilio silvia pro)
## Who Is the Rancilio silvia Pro For?

Before diving into the specifics, let’s consider the target audience for the Rancilio Silvia Pro. This machine caters to three main groups:

*   **Home Barista Enthusiasts:** These are individuals who have moved beyond basic espresso machines and are looking for a meaningful upgrade. They appreciate precision, temperature stability, and features like PID controllers and pre-infusion. they're willing to invest in quality but are also cost-conscious.
*   **Small Office Coffee Setups:** For businesses requiring a reliable espresso machine for a small team, the Rancilio Silvia Pro offers a balance of performance and user-friendliness. Durability, ease of maintenance, and a presentable aesthetic are key considerations for this group. Ideal office size is around 5-20 users.
*   **Coffee Connoisseurs:** These individuals are deeply passionate about coffee and demand a high level of control over the brewing process. They experiment with different beans, grind sizes, and techniques to achieve optimal extraction and flavor profiles. Consistency and temperature stability are paramount.

## Diving Deep: Rancilio Silvia Pro Features and Performance

The Rancilio Silvia Pro builds upon the legacy of the original Silvia with several key enhancements. Here’s a closer look at itS defining features:

*   **PID Controller:** A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is a vital component, especially for home baristas seeking consistency. This electronic brain monitors and regulates the brew water temperature, minimizing temperature surfing – a common issue with simpler espresso machines. This technology eliminates the guesswork and allows for more repeatable results,shot after shot. Precise temperature control is key to extracting the maximum flavor and aroma from your coffee beans,avoiding bitter or sour shots caused by temperature fluctuations.
*   **Dual Boiler System:** Unlike the single-boiler design of the original Silvia, the rancilio Silvia Pro utilizes a dual boiler system. This means separate boilers for brewing espresso and steaming milk. This is a game-changer for those who frequently make milk-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. The dual boiler system allows you to brew espresso and steam milk simultaneously without waiting for the machine to reheat, saving valuable time and making the workflow more efficient.*   **Pre-Infusion:** The Rancilio Silvia Pro features a pre-infusion function, which gently saturates the coffee grounds before full pressure is applied. This allows for a more even extraction, reducing channeling and improving the overall flavor of the espresso. Pre-infusion helps to bloom the coffee grounds, releasing CO2 and preparing the bed for optimal extraction, resulting in a richer and more balanced cup.
*   **Commercial-Grade Components:** The Silvia Pro boasts several commercial-grade components, including a robust brass grouphead and a heavy-duty portafilter. These components contribute to the machine’s durability and temperature stability, further enhancing its performance and longevity. The commercial components are designed to withstand heavy use and maintain consistent temperatures,ensuring reliable performance over time.
*   **Compact Design:** While packing a punch in terms of features, the Rancilio Silvia Pro maintains a relatively compact footprint, making it suitable for smaller kitchens or offices.
*   **Programmable Features:** Many iterations,like the Rancilio Silvia Pro X offer programmable features such as shot timers and adjustable pre-infusion,allowing for even greater customization and control over the brewing process.[[Explore Top Rated rancilio silvia pro on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=rancilio silvia pro)
## Speculating on a 2025 Model: What Could Be Improved?

While the current Rancilio Silvia Pro is a solid machine, there's always room for advancement. Here are some potential upgrades we might see in a hypothetical 2025 model:

*   **Enhanced Connectivity:** The integration of smart technology, such as a mobile app for controlling settings and monitoring performance, could be a welcome addition.*   **Improved Water Tank Design:** A larger or more easily accessible water tank would enhance user convenience, especially for office environments. Users would appreciate the ability to know how much water is left in the reservoir without having to check with a flashlight behind the machine.
*   **Quieter Operation:** While the Silvia Pro's vibratory pump is acceptable, reducing the noise level would contribute to a more pleasant brewing experience.
*   **More Intuitive Interface:** A more user-friendly display and controls would make the machine even easier to operate, particularly for those new to semi-automatic espresso brewing. Consider the difference between a touch screen and the current button layout.
*   **Direct Plumb Option:** Including the option for direct water line connection would eliminate the need for manual refilling, a significant advantage for small office setups.

## Examining the Price Tag: Rancilio Silvia Pro Price and Value

The Rancilio Silvia pro sits in the ""prosumer"" category,meaning it bridges the gap between entry-level home machines and professional-grade equipment. As such, its price reflects its capabilities. The Rancilio Silvia Pro price typically ranges depending on the retailer, promotions, and any included accessories. While it is a significant investment, it's significant to consider the long-term value. The machine's durability,performance,and features offer a considerable upgrade over cheaper alternatives. The Rancilio Silvia Pro's robust build quality and the control it offers the barista make it a worthwhile buy for those serious about their espresso. To find the best price Rancilio Silvia Pro often requires doing some online research. Compare prices between different online retailers and be sure to check for deals from authorized Rancilio dealers to ensure warranty coverage.[[Explore Top Rated rancilio silvia pro on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=rancilio silvia pro)
## Rancilio Silvia Pro vs. The Competition: Alternatives to Consider

While the Rancilio Silvia Pro is a strong contender, it's crucial to explore alternatives to ensure you're making the right choice. Here are a few machines worth considering:

*   **Rancilio Silvia Pro vs. Gaggia Classic Pro:** The Gaggia Classic Pro is a more budget-friendly option that offers a similar aesthetic to the original silvia. Though, it lacks the dual boiler system and PID controller of the Silvia pro, resulting in less temperature stability and control. For those on a tighter budget, the Gaggia Classic pro is a solid machine but the Silvia Pro represents a significant upgrade.
*   **Rancilio Silvia Pro vs. Lelit Anna:** The Lelit Anna is another entry-level machine that offers decent performance for the price. However, like the Gaggia Classic Pro, it lacks the advanced features of the silvia Pro.
*   **Breville/Sage Dual Boiler:** This machine is a popular alternative known for its user-friendly interface and advanced features, including pre-infusion and PID temperature control. It often comes with a built-in grinder, adding to its convenience. However, some users find its build quality less robust compared to the Rancilio Silvia Pro.
*     **Profitec Pro 500:** A heat exchange machine that is German-engineered and built to last. The Pro 500 Offers commercial-grade features at a similar price, and might potentially be preferred by those looking for a robust machine in the same class.Ultimately,the best alternative depends on your budget,needs,and priorities.

*   **Regular Cleaning:** Backflush the machine regularly with a suitable espresso machine cleaner to remove coffee oils and residue. clean the portafilter and baskets daily.
*   **Water Quality:** Use filtered water to prevent scale buildup,which can damage the machine and affect the taste of your espresso. Consider using a water filter pitcher or installing a water softener.

*   **Lubrication:** Lubricate the grouphead gasket periodically to ensure a proper seal.
*   **Professional Servicing:** Consider having the machine professionally serviced every year or two to ensure optimal performance and longevity.
*   **Rancilio Silvia Pro Cleaning:** Cleaning the steam wand promptly after use prevents milk buildup, which can be arduous to remove.

1jqut2y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqut2y,Brain surgery success story,"The first pic was taken whilst he was VERY sick, and the ones that follow document his recovery progress.

I mentioned my cat when replying to someone else’s post, and a few of you asked me questions about it. So I thought I’d answer them here to give better details.
Apologies in advance for some icky medical details (don’t read on if squeamish) and I’ve given some financial details which feels a little crass - but people asked and I wanted to oblige in case it’s helpful information. This is also a very long post, sorry!

Zero is 10 years old, and has never had any health issues at all. He’s neutered, and has had all his vaccinations, eats well, and has lived indoors all his life with his brother Chino from the same litter.

In January, we noticed that he was starting to be a little more clumsy that usual, slipping off furniture and things like that. He’s never been very graceful, so it didn’t raise any alarm bells until a few weeks later as it got worse. He would no longer jump up onto the sofa or to his favourite spot on our guest bed. We took him to the vet, and they did some basic tests to see if it was an inner ear issue, or if he was struggling with mobility in certain paws. Our suspicions were confirmed, in that he wasn’t responding well to stimulus in his front right paw.

The vet said that he wouldn’t be able to make a diagnosis, but said that it was likely a spinal issue, or a neurological one. He referred us to a specialist about an hour away who would be able to do a CS scan and or an MRI scan to determine the issue.

We got a call back from the specialist after just a few days on the following Monday. I let them know that by now, he was starting to lose interest in food and he didn’t seem to be drinking at all. They got us an appointment booked in for Friday that week.

That week was AGONIZING. He was deteriorating rapidly. He was barely moving at all, he would only eat those yogurt treat sachet things, and only if I held it right under his nose. He just wanted to be left alone, and to sit somewhere dark, so we made him a comfortable space with a heat mat tented with a blanket. I was adding water to the treats to make sure he was getting some hydration. He would go for a whole day or longer without peeing, and it had me so anxious I was constantly in tears. I called an emergency vet on the Thursday evening at about 10:30pm because he hadn’t peed in almost two days. They said they were worried he could have a blockage and I’d need to take him in asap. I quickly jumped in the shower, I was so stressed I hadn’t showered in days. And while I was in there, he came in to the bathroom and did the longest pee I’ve ever seen a cat do on the litter tray. I cried (again) with relief and let the emergency vet know we wouldn’t need to go in.
That whole week, I was worried at any point we could lose him. He was so frail and weak, I had to hold him up in the litter tray because any time he did use it he would fall over while he was peeing or pooping.

Friday morning came and we drove him to the neurology specialists. He must have had an adrenaline rush, because in the car the whole way, and while we were there - he acted like he was totally fine!!
Cats are very good at hiding pain, and if they’re in a situation where there may be unknown predators or danger - something just takes over and it can become as though they’re as strong and fit as ever for a brief time.

The neurologist did some tests in her office with us, and noticed that his right eye wasn’t responding to some stimulus, as well as the front right paw. She said it was likely a brain issue, and for that reason suggested we go straight to the MRI. His scan was booked for that afternoon.
She warned us, that because he’s considered a senior cat, and because he’s probably fighting some kind of brain tumour, he could be quite weak, and therefore there would be a risk that he may not survive the anaesthesia required for the scan. But if we didn’t do it, then we wouldn’t know how to treat him and he’d continue to get worse. So we knew we had to do it.
I watched with tears in my eyes as they put him in a tiny cage to take him away, terrified that this would be the last time I’d see him alive.

We drove to a local McDonald’s, as we didn’t know the area, and drank coffee and waited. They told us if anything went wrong, they’d call us right away, but otherwise we should expect to hear an update after the scan at around 3pm.
That was possibly the worst coffee I’ve ever had. Knowing that *if* my phone rang, which it could at any minute, it would be to tell us that our little boy that we have loved for ten whole years, had passed away.

After what felt like an eternity, they called to say the scan had been successful, and that they were starting to bring him out from the anaesthesia and that all his vitals were normal and quite strong throughout the scan process. We went back to the hospital, and the neurologist told us they had discovered a very large brain tumour in the front of his skull. She offered to show us the imaging, but I didn’t want to look.
It was taking up roughly one third of the space inside his skull, applying pressure to the front of the brain which was impacting things like his olfactory and other senses he would normally use to see and interact with the world around him - hence why he was struggling and wanted to sit in the quiet and dark, and why he had no interest in food. She said he had probably been dealing with a headache for a few weeks, but the tests they did with him prior to the scan didn’t score too highly so it was hard to tell. She also said that his brain was being pushed towards the back of his skull, meaning the back parts of his brain were being compressed. This is probably why he was struggling with mobility.

Our next options were:
**Palliative care.** Administering pain killers at home and keeping him as comfortable as possible. But with the size of the tumour we would only have a number of weeks left with him.
**Surgery.** The tumour was most likely a meningioma, and appeared to be outside the brain rather than embedded into it. And with it being so large, it would be easy to see it while trying to remove it.
Of course it same with risks. There was the same risk of his body not coping with the anaesthesia. The surgery was going to be near delicate blood vessels around his eyes and sinuses. Any bleeding there could risk causing a stroke and instant death, or a more slow bleed could still result in catastrophic blood loss and death.

Despite the risks, we knew it was worth it because of how poor his quality of life would be in those last few weeks.
If the surgery went well, it could potentially be curative! And Zero might experience instant relief once the tumour was removed and his brain had the full space again to re-pressurize.

Luckily, we had insurance. Insurance covered some, but not all of the costs. And we were also in the process of taking some equity out of our mortgage, so that we would have a “lump sum” to do some home renovations with. So we knew that was on the horizon. We were so so fortunate to be in that situation, as for a lot of families this may not have been affordable, and I empathise so strongly with those who face losing their beloved pet instead. I’ve been in that position growing up.

The MRI scan was roughly £3,000
The surgery would be around £6,000 provided there were no complications that might incur extra costs from additional products or procedures.
And we would also have prescription medication to administer for the next few weeks post surgery.
**All in all, it was roughly £9-10k.**

We had to wait another whole week until his surgery, all the while he was still in a very bad state. They had sent us home with some pain relief, and some steroid. They had given him a sugar that dehydrates the brain while he was in there, and this seemed to relieve some pressure. So for the next 12 hours he was close to being normal, but as soon as it wore off we were back to helping him use the litter box and waking up throughout the night to see if he was still breathing.
During that week, we made lots of changes around the house including buying ramps that he could use to get onto our bed, blocking off rooms he might hide in etc. But between having no appetite and having to be forced to take pills, he wasn’t really interested in using ramps and just wanted to be in his little safe space we made him.
He seemed to just be getting worse and worse, and the weight he had lost was really showing.

Surgery time came, and we dropped him off on the Thursday evening. The neurologist walked us through what would happen.
He would be in intensive care overnight, and prepped for surgery Friday morning. The surgery usually takes 3-4 hours, but she said it could take longer - and they would just go on for as long as he needed. If anything went wrong, one of the two surgeons would scrub out immediately and come and call us.
If all went well, then they would keep him in intensive care over the weekend, and depending on his recovery we could pick him up on Monday.

More anxiety.
I couldn’t focus on Friday, I watched Disney movies as a comforting distraction and waited for the call. Again, I knew if I got a call early, it could be to give me the worst news.

When the neurologist called, she immediately sounded upbeat and positive which was a relief.
She let us know that Zero was ok, and already starting to regain consciousness. Over 95% of the tumour was removed, but the small amount left behind could have caused some brain damage if they tried too hard to get it out. This means there’s a chance if could grow back, but a biopsy on the tissue would give us more information. They gave him a thin membrane of collagen protecting his brain from his open sinuses, and patched his skull with a titanium plate. There were some internal stitches that would dissolve, and the outer incision was glued up securely.

We were overjoyed!
Over the weekend we received a call every morning to let us know how he had done overnight and what state he was in. All the ICU nurses were pleased with his progress and said he showed no signs of seizures, so they were confident this meant no brain bleeds post operation. He was sedated, but eating and seemed comfortable.

When we went to pick him up on the Monday, Zero was prescribed:
25mg tablet of gabatentin (beef flavoured!) three times a day.
1 ml of an anti seizure solution twice a day.
2 antibiotic tablets every day.
1 steroid tablet every day.

The various meds tapered off at different intervals over the next 6-8 weeks, but in the first week we were giving him medication at 5 different intervals every day. It was hard because he hated it!!

When they gave him back to us, he seemed a little bit anxious in his carrier, but he was on his feet and alert. It was so good to see him, it was like meeting a completely different cat than the frail little bundle we gave them before the weekend.

Walking was difficult at first and he fell a lot, but he also struggled to lie down and get comfortable. The only way to get him to settle and sleep was to hold him, he instantly start purring and would fall asleep quickly. So for the first two weeks, I had to hold him in my arms overnight to get him to sleep and get myself up if he woke up to get some water or to the new very low to the ground litter box. He would sleep with his face squished into mine, which was cute but the anti seizure medication smelled very sickly sweet on his breath 😂

Every day, Zero seemed a tiny bit better. We kept the changes to our home for a few weeks, so we could limit the space he had access to, gradually expanding it so he could stretch his legs a little more. 
He got stronger and stronger, and eventually started using the ramp to get onto the guest bed. He even got strong enough around week 4 to jump over the suitcase we had blocking the stairs! So we knew it was time to let him use the stairs again. He went back to using his regular litter box, but we still have puppy pads around its entrance. He’s had a few accidents, but mostly because he walks into the box and doesn’t squat to pee - so it just shoots right out of the entrance to the littler box 🫠 He’ll get there! He’s having fewer and fewer of those accidents.

He’s been eating really well, and he’s almost put on ALL the weight he lost. He’s almost looking just like he did before he got sick!
He’s almost finished all of his medication, and is only having half a steroid tablet every other day. As of next week he will be 100% medication free! The neurologist asked for regular phone check ins to hear how he’s doing, and she’s been very pleased with his progress and was very helpful in advising how we step down off of each of his meds. She’s asked for another update in a couple of months.
His bald head is starting to look fuzzy again now too, there’s just a slight bald patch along the incision where the glue recently came off (it stayed on a long time and I had to apply Vaseline to it to help soften it eventually.) His brother didn’t recognise him while he looked totally bald, but they’ve been cuddling together again for the last couple of weeks which I’m sure has helped Zero feel much more relaxed and at home.
The steroids have dried out his skin a little bit, this is especially noticeable on his ears because the hair on them was shaved off. I’ve been applying a cat safe nose and paw balm in the dry exposed areas, and the vet agreed this is the best this to do for now - but this should improve as the steroids gradually leave his system.
He’s playing with toys again, and play fighting with his brother.

I’m 32 and my husband is 31. We’ve been TTC since November 2024. Prior MMC in March 2024. This is cycle 4 with Inito.

Here’s what I’ve been doing:
- Seed Cycling since December
    - Follicular phase: pumpkin & flax 
    - Luteal phase: sesame & sunflower
- 2 Brazil nuts everyday
- Breakfast everyday:
    - Plain greek yogurt, fresh blueberries, pomegranate seeds, multi grain granola, & whatever seeds I needed to eat for the phase I was in.
- Ritual Prenatal vitamins since March 2024
- Ritual Symbiotic pre/pro and post biotics
- Ubiquinol (CoQ10) 200 mg since December
- Vitamin C
- B6
- Low Dose Aspirin
- Magnesium
- Switched my Nespresso Costa Rica coffee pod to decaf in February

Tried using Mucinex during my High Fertility days to loosen my CM and help sperm meet egg this cycle. 

Tested my blood progesterone levels on DPO 7 in February to ease my anxiety of having low PDG. My mom also had to be put on supplements with both my sisters.

My husband had a semen analysis done last week and had low volume, moderate white blood cells (indicating inflammation) and low 2hr mobility. He’s seeing a urologist for further testing.

Symptoms with MMC (8 weeks) - cramping really bad, sore, heavy boobs, change in Areola color, bloated, constipated, spotting, heightened sense of smell, high resting heart rate, elevated BBT, exhaustion, vivid dreams.

Symptoms this time around - sore, heavy boobs, bloating, sleep changes (tired but sleepless), higher resting heart rate, elevated BBT, increased CM. I was traveling for work so I thought it was just my usual progesterone symptoms and time zone change throwing me off.

Cautiously optimistic due to the semen analysis results and our prior MMC. But still in shock to see those 2 pink lines! 🥹

My baby hates anything unless it's the baby carrier. I even struggle to rock him to sleep most of the time. I tried to go get a coffee today and took him for a ride hoping to just get a few minutes to myself before picking my toddler up from the babysitter and he screamed his head off the whole time.  He hates his car seat, swings, bouncer, anything unless it's the stupid baby wrap. It's the only way I can get him to nap during the day. My first born cried but I could at least get a moments peace with a car ride or pushing him in the stroller. 

At night, I can usually get 2 hour stretches with him in the bassinet but at least once a night I have to fight for 2 hours to get him to sleep.  I am just exhausted and touched out. 

My husband works all day and helps when he can in the evenings but as I said we also have a 2.5 year old son who adores his dad.  

I bawled in the car just feeling like I made a mistake having this second baby.  We were in such a good groove as a family of three. Then of course I feel guilty for feeling like that because I know it will get better at some point. It's just so tough right now. I am on 10mg of Lexapro and have been for 3 weeks now. 

My husband and mom are adamant I need to try hypoallergenic formula but everyone on the forums says this is just typical newborn behavior. He had blood in his poop about 2 weeks ago but the Ped chalked it up to an anal fissure or since we haven't seen anymore blood except for that one occurrence. 

I am just a mess at the moment and I just need some words of encouragement that this will get better. Advice is also appreciated.   ",2,1743715224.0,newborns,0,1.0,False

On arrival:  
Get some money from the ATM.  
Buy an Orange SIM card (Expresso also option, but less good 4G coverage)  
It was 15000 CFA for 15GB.  
Get Orange Money and Wave apps, most places and people accept this. You can deposit money on them using Xoom (build in the Paypal app).  
The Max It app can be used to up your mobile Orange plan using Orange money  
There is Wifi in the airport.   
  
This was roughly our route:  
\- Airplane to Airport  
\- Shuttle bus thing to Dakar (expensive, get a taxi instead)  
\- DemDikk bus to St Louis   
\- Visit that bird park  
\- DemDikk bus back to Dakar  
\- visit Ile de Goree  
\- Boat to Ziguinchor  
\- Public transport to places in that area: Point Saint-Georges, Cap Skirring  
\- Public transport through Gambia to Fathala Wildlife reserve (at the borders you have to pay 40000 processing fees in total)  
\- Public transport to Kaolak  
\- Public transport to Warang  
\- visit Ile de Fadiouth  
\- Taxi to airport

We have noticed the following stable prices:  
\- Caffee touba: 100  
\- Baguette: 500 to 1000  
\- Bottle of water: 300-500  
\- Small bottle of water: 100 - 200  
\- Taxi: use the Yango or Heetch taxi apps get a price estimation  
\- Small bag of peanuts: 100  
\- Big bag of peanuts: 500  
\- Plat du jour: \~3000  
  
\- Know what you are willing to pay. Be willing to walk away and try another seller. A general rule of thumb: take half of the suggested price, and add 500CFA. It helps to check what other local customers pay. For prices shown above, it helps having the exact amount. For example, for the coffee, just shove a 100CFA coin in their hand. Also always agree on a price before getting the product / service.  
  
\- When Xoom by Paypal denies your deposits on Wave / Orange money, you have to up the limit. For Wave, go to a Wave service agent, spread all across town. They scan your passport and your limit gets increased to 1000000 CFA within 1 minute.  
  
\- Demdikk is the app for organised public transport. For example bus rides between Dakar and St Louis. They leave on time and have air-conditioning.   
  
\- Other public transport consists of old Peugeot 505: called 'sept-place' (7 places, and those hippy busses. You can get on them on 'garages', which are sort of public transport stations (example: Garage Nioro in Kaolak). They leave when they are full. One time the \~15 person bus before us just left, so we had to wait 2 hours before ours was filled.  
  
\- Sometimes we stayed at peaceful, touristy hotels. After a day we felt ourselves craving the liveliness of the cities again.  
  
\- Having someone who can speak and understand basic french with you is really recommended  
  
\- We have not gotten sick. We had some mild diarrhea, but probably due to the spices and not bacteria.  
  
\- Go to a restaurant that looks local. Order 'Plat du jour' there (meal of the day), which is what most people eat. You can often choose between the meat: chicken, fish or beef  
  
\- Buy a baguette across the street, very nice and cheap lunch.  
  
\- Do not give money to begging children. This saves money. Another benefit is that you don't stimulate the forced begging practices these kids fall under or something. Although, sometimes, we gave them a tangerine if we had just bought them for example. Some seemed happy with it and went their way, some just kept staring at us for more.  
  
\- Travel sickness: I did not get nauseous on the roads, as they are basically straight lines. The driver having to go around all the holes holes and has to go over bumps, which can fuck you up if you dont look outside.  
  
\- I felt safe on the streets with our group of 4. There are no groups hanging on the streets. People are friendly and all seem friendly with eachother. We avoided going on the streets when it was dark.  
  
\- At some market-like places, a lot of people will approach you. If this gets overwhelming, just ignore them (rude but unfortunately the most effective). In Kaolak, people wont do this.  
  
\- Google maps misses about half the stuff, and a lot of places dont have websites. Often we just had to just call places we saw in our Lonely Planet book  
  
\- lot of things are broken, its like they were never proper to begin with: toilet flushing, cracked tiles, loose faucets,   
  
\- Kaolack is very interesting, no one speaks to you and it feels really lively and realistic.  
  
\- A lot of really old cars still drive. Most thing are broken inside the car: seat belts, ceiling, speedometers  
  
\- Honking between cars is often is friendly and attentive  
  
\- Doing cheap stuff gives you the best experience: local food, local transport, etc  
  
\- The outlets were all European  
  
\- Half of the toilets dont flush. You are supposed to use the bucket of water nearby for that.  
  
\- At restaurants, if you didnt get enough sauce / seasoning, etc, just ask for more. I think they dont want to put excessive stuff at the table for them later to throw away

Picture this: It’s the final minutes of the Super Bowl, your team’s about to score, and—*buffering*. Again. Sound familiar? Yeah, I’ve been there too. After years of battling unreliable streams, overpriced cable packages, and shady IPTV providers that vanish overnight (RIP, my $60), I decided enough was enough.

That’s when I dove deep into the wild world of **IPTV subscriptions**—testing, comparing, and yes, *occasionally* rage-quitting—to find the **best IPTV service** that won’t leave you stranded mid-game. And guess what? In 2025, the game has *changed*.

I’ve even braved the trenches of **IPTV Reddit threads** to see which services hold up under real-world chaos.

Here’s the truth: **Not all IPTV providers are created equal**. Some lure you in with cheap prices, then hit you with hidden fees. Others promise 4K streams but buffer like it’s 2005. And don’t get me started on those “24/7 support” teams that ghost you faster than a bad Tinder date.

Hey there, fellow cord-cutter! If you're anything like me, you're tired of shelling out hundreds for cable just to watch five channels and endure endless commercials. And let’s not even talk about that *one* sports network your provider refuses to include (*looking at you, Comcast*).

That’s why I dove deep into the world of **best IPTV providers**—testing, buffering (ugh), and comparing them all—so you don’t have to. We'll cover **costs, hidden fees, must-have hardware, and sneaky add-ons** that can turn a ""great deal"" into an expensive headache.

By the end of this, you’ll know **exactly** which **premium IPTV subscription** is worth your cash in 2025.

# 1. What Makes the Best IPTV Service in 2025? (Spoiler: It’s Not Just Price)

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of **IPTV subscription costs**, let’s talk about **what actually matters** when picking a service.

# ✅ The Must-Have Features in a Top-Tier IPTV Provider

* **Reliability** – No one likes a stream that buffers more than a politician dodging questions.
* **Content Library** – 40,000+ channels? 150,000+ VOD? Yes, please.
* **EPG (Electronic Program Guide)** – Because scrolling through 10,000 channels blindly is a special kind of torture.
* **Multi-Device Support** – Firestick, Android, Smart TV? All should work flawlessly.
* **Customer Support** – If they ghost you faster than a Tinder date, run.

# 🔍 IPTV Provider Ranking Criteria (How I Tested Them)

I didn’t just take these services at face value. Nope. I **lived** with them for months. Here’s what I checked:  
✔ **Buffering & Uptime** (Does it crash during big games?)  
✔ **Content Freshness** (Are movies updated, or stuck in 2010?)  
✔ **Hidden Fees** (Because surprise charges are the worst.)  
✔ **Reddit Reputation** (I scoured **IPTV Reddit** threads for real user feedback.)

Now, let’s get into the **best IPTV service** contenders for 2025.

# 2. The Best Premium IPTV Subscriptions of 2025 (Tested & Ranked)



# [🏆 #1 – IPTVUnlock – Best for Massive Content Library](http://iptvunlock.com)

📊 **How It Stacks Up**

# [💰 #3 – IPTVRESALE – Best Budget IPTV (Without the Scam Vibes)](http://iptvresale.com)

🔗 [iptvresale.com](https://iptvresale.com)

Let’s be real—some ""budget"" IPTV services are **hot garbage**. Either they **buffer constantly**, or they **disappear overnight** with your money. **IPTVRESALE** is the rare exception.

# Why It’s the Best Cheap(er) Option

* **40,000+ channels** (Yes, even at this price)

💡 **Best For:** Anyone who wants **quality without breaking the bank**.

🔗 **Give it a go:** [iptvresale.com](https://iptvresale.com)

# 3. Hidden Fees & Add-Ons (What Providers Won’t Tell You)

Ah yes, the **fine print**. Some providers lure you in with a low price, then hit you with **extra costs**. Here’s what to watch for:

# 🔴 Sneaky Extra Charges

✔ **""Premium"" Channel Packs** – Some services advertise ""20,000 channels!"" but lock the good stuff behind another paywall.  
✔ **EPG Access Fees** – A functional TV guide **should** be standard. Some charge extra.  
✔ **Multi-Device Fees** – Want to watch on two screens? That’ll be $5/month extra.

**Pro Tip:** Always check **IPTV Reddit threads** for real user experiences—scammers get exposed fast.

# 🛠️ Hardware Costs (What You’ll Actually Need)

* **Firestick 4K ($40-$60)** – The easiest plug-and-play option.
* **Android Box ($80-$150)** – Better for heavy users.
* **VPN (Optional but Recommended)** – Keeps your streams private (I use NordVPN).

# Final Verdict: Which IPTV Service Wins in 2025?

If you want:

* **The most content?** ➔ [IPTVUnlock](https://iptvunlock.com)
* **The best sports?** ➔ [IPTVGREAT](https://iptvgreat.me)
* **A great deal?** ➔ [IPTVRESALE](https://iptvresale.com)

No matter what you pick, just **avoid shady sellers**—stick to well-reviewed **best IPTV providers** like these.

# Conclusion

**A Conclusion You’ll Actually Want to Read (Because IPTV Shouldn’t Be Complicated)**

Alright, let’s wrap this up like a cozy blanket around your streaming habits. If you’ve made it this far, you’re clearly serious about ditching overpriced cable or that sketchy free IPTV app that buffers more than a WiFi-deprived coffee shop. (We’ve all been there.)

So, what’s the verdict after dissecting the **best IPTV providers** of 2025? Here’s the *real talk*:

* **IPTVUnlock** is your go-to if you’re a content hoarder—40,000+ channels and 150,000 VOD titles is basically Netflix on steroids. [Check it out here](https://iptvunlock.com) if you hate missing *anything*.

* **IPTVRESALE** keeps it affordable *without* the “why is this buffering during the season finale?!” rage. [Give it a shot here](https://iptvresale.com) if your wallet’s side-eyeing you.

**Here’s the thing:** Picking the **best IPTV service** isn’t just about channel counts or flashy ads. It’s about *your* needs. Are you a soccer mom who needs Peppa Pig in 4K? A die-hard MMA fan? Or just someone who wants to binge *The Office* for the 47th time? (No judgment.)

I’ll admit—I used to waste hours scrolling **IPTV Reddit** threads, drowning in conflicting reviews. Then I realized: the “best” IPTV subscription is the one that *works* for *you*. No hidden fees, no hardware headaches, just solid streams. That’s why I tested these three so *you* don’t have to.

**So, what’s next?**

1. **Try a trial**—most legit providers offer one. If they don’t? Red flag.
2. **Check your setup**. Got a Firestick? Android? Don’t assume compatibility.
3. **Read the fine print**. “Unlimited channels” sounds great until it’s 20,000 potato-quality streams.

And hey, if you’re still on the fence, ask yourself: *How much is my sanity worth when the big game’s on?* A few bucks a month for buffer-free bliss? Yeah, thought so.

**Final thought:** The **best IPTV providers** in 2025 aren’t just selling subscriptions—they’re selling freedom from cable’s chokehold. So, grab that remote, click one of those links above ([IPTVUnlock](https://iptvunlock.com), [IPTVGREAT](https://iptvgreat.me), or [IPTVRESALE](https://iptvresale.com)), and start streaming like you *mean it*.

Because life’s too short for pixelated playoffs. 🍿

# Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What makes a premium IPTV subscription “best” in 2025?**  
Great question! The **best IPTV service** isn’t just about channel count—it’s about reliability, content quality, and transparency. I rank providers based on:

* **Stability:** No one likes buffering during the Super Bowl (trust me, I’ve suffered enough for all of us).
* **Content:** Look for 4K streams, a massive VOD library (like IPTVUnlock’s 150,000+ movies/shows), and premium sports/PPV.
* **Hidden fees:** Some “budget” services sneak in HD surcharges or VPN requirements.
* **Support:** If they ghost you after payment, *run*.

**2. Are cheaper IPTV subscriptions worth it, or do you get what you pay for?**  
Short answer: Sometimes, but *always* check the fine print. The **most affordable IPTV subscription** might save you $5/month, but if it lacks EPG (TV guide) or buffers constantly, it’s a headache. For example, IPTVGREAT (iptvgreat.me) costs a bit more but delivers rock-solid sports streams—worth every penny if you’re a fan.

**3. What hidden fees should I watch out for?**  
Oh boy, where do I start? Common ones include:

* **“HD Access” fees:** Some providers charge extra for HD/4K, even if they advertise it upfront.
* **VPN requirements:** If your ISP blocks IPTV, you might *need* a VPN ($$).
* **Device limits:** “Unlimited devices” might mean “2 at a time.” Always check.

**4. Do I need special hardware for IPTV in 2025?**  
Depends! A **Firestick 4K** or **NVIDIA Shield** handles 4K streams smoothly, but older devices might struggle. Pro tip: Avoid cheap Android boxes—they often overheat. IPTVUnlock (iptvunlock.com) works great on Firestick, Smart TVs, and even phones, but check your provider’s compatibility list.

**5. How do new IPTV providers in 2025 compare to older ones?**  
The **new IPTV providers 2025** are stepping up their game with better tech (less buffering) and bigger libraries. For example, newer services like IPTVUnlock offer **40,000+ channels** vs. older providers capping at 1,000. But always check **IPTV Reddit** threads for real-user reviews—some “new” providers are just rebranded duds.

**6. Can I trust IPTV provider rankings I see online?**  
*Sigh*. Many “ranking” sites are just affiliate mills. My advice:

* Look for **detailed comparisons** (like my chart on IPTVUnlock vs. others).
* **Check Reddit:** The **best IPTV Reddit** threads are brutally honest.
* Test with a **24-hour trial** before committing.

**7. What’s the average cost of a premium IPTV subscription in 2025?**  
Prices range from **$10–$20/month** for solid services. For example:

* **IPTVUnlock:** \~$15/month for 40K+ channels + VOD.
* **IPTVGREAT:** \~$18/month (but unbeatable for sports). Beware of services under $10—they often cut corners (or disappear overnight).

**8. Are there legal risks with IPTV subscriptions?**  
This is fuzzy. Most **IPTV providers** operate in a gray area. To stay safe:

* Use a **VPN** (especially for geo-locked content).
* Avoid services offering **every single PPV event for free**—that’s a red flag.
* Stick to providers with **transparent terms** (like the ones I recommend).

**9. How do I know if an IPTV service is reliable before buying?**  
Here’s my checklist:  
✅ **24-hour trial:** Test during peak hours (e.g., Sunday NFL games).  
✅ **EPG (TV guide) quality:** If it’s missing or glitchy, walk away.  
✅ **Reddit buzz:** Search “\[Provider Name\] + Reddit” for unfiltered takes.  
✅ **Refund policy:** At least 7 days is ideal.

**10. What’s the #1 mistake people make when choosing an IPTV service?**  
Falling for **“unlimited everything”** claims. No provider *actually* offers infinite 4K streams without throttling. Instead, look for honest limits (e.g., “3 simultaneous devices”) and **real user reviews**. And remember: If it sounds too good to be true (*cough* $5/month for 10K channels *cough*), it probably is.

I can of course tell that two substantially different coffees are different from each other, but no clue how to identify how they are different.

That being said, from my handful of first roasts, after getting past trying to find consistency and hit the desired roast level, how much expression is there in roasting versus just letting the inherent bean qualities take center stage while trying to get all the beans of a uniform roast level?

1jqubj1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqubj1,Room Available in Somerville Apartment: May 1 - Aug 31 (Potential to Extend),"Hello!

My roommate and I are looking for a third person to sublet a bedroom in our 3-bedroom, 1-bathroom apartment in Somerville. The sublet would run from May 1st through the end of August 2025, with the possibility of extending into the next year if it feels like a good mutual fit. Your share of rent will be $1000 a month.

**The Apartment & Location:** We're on the first floor of a three-decker building, situated north of Teele Square (towards Arlington). Getting groceries is easy with Stop & Shop just a couple of minutes walk away. For commuting or heading into town, Davis Square and the Red Line are about a 15-minute walk, or you can hop on a bus from the stop just 2 minutes down the street.

The apartment itself is quite comfortable and spacious. The kitchen comes equipped with a reliable gas stove and refrigerator, plus plenty of counter and cabinet space which is nice for cooking. Just a heads-up, there's no dishwasher. We also have a microwave, toaster oven, and Keurig that everyone shares. If you like coffee, I have an espresso machine and am happy to make drinks for the house.

The living room is a good spot to relax, with a 4K TV and stereo system available for everyone to use. Coin-op laundry is in the basement, shared with the friendly and quiet family living on the 2nd floor. Street parking is available with a Somerville permit.

**The Room:** The available bedroom faces the street and gets nice natural light. It will be mostly unfurnished, though the curtains and some small rugs can stay, and our previous roommate mentioned he could potentially leave his dresser if helpful. There isn't a closet inside the room itself, but our roommate has been using the closets in the living room area right next to the room for additional storage.

**Rent & Utilities:** Rent for the room is $1000 per month, dropped off via check to our landlord (who lives on the 3rd floor). Water is included in the rent. We split the costs for internet, gas, and electricity. The good news is we have a great deal on fast internet (1000Mbps download for $35/month total, split three ways). Gas and electric bills vary seasonally – they're higher in the winter but reasonable otherwise.

**About Us:** You'd be sharing the space with two guys, both 27. I'm a content manager and work mostly remote from my room, while my roommate teaches elementary school in Malden. We're friendly, respectful, and keep the common areas reasonably tidy. We're pretty relaxed – no strict chore charts, just a general expectation that we all chip in and keep the shared spaces pleasant.

We enjoy music, watching sports, and movies. We're fairly quiet during the week, mostly keeping to ourselves. Much of our free time is spent with our respective girlfriends, but occasionally we have friends over on weekends. We're looking for someone who is considerate, responsible, and easy to get along with.

**Other Details:** We'll sort out a simple sublet agreement. No smoking is allowed inside the apartment. We don't currently have any pets, but the landlord is potentially okay with them if we give notice, so we'd be open to discussing it if you have a pet.

If this sounds like it could be a good fit for you, please send us a message and tell us a little about yourself! We’re happy to answer any questions.

You may have noticed if you ever used voice chat or have gotten into an argument with another person is that no matter how much you try to soften up your words or take extra care in not saying any swears, ROBLOX prefers to ban YOU over the other person, irregardless of whether the other party has incited the argument or has said something 10x more foul than you did. And what I noticed is that you are more likely to be banned over the other person if your account is verified to be over 17+

In an experiment, I had me and my friend (who never bothered to verify his age) say the exact same thing in chat in a public server (it was about which coffee is better). And Lo and Behold, I was the one who received a punitive punishment rather than my friend. I'm unsure if this was the result of people spamming reports on our chat, or rather an automated punishment, so I'm planning on doing the exact same thing in a private server. 

Now, I can see where ROBLOX is going with this, as kids are more prone to say stupid things and therefore, should get more leniency. However, this is a problem because kid DO say stupid things and it doesn't even matter if they're actually 15 or 26, never verified their age and harassing another person, ROBLOX takes a laughably small stance on their punishment, while doubling the punishment and passing it over to the person who just so happened to be 17+ verified, leading to them being unable to even retaliate them back with a simple ""shut up"". This becomes an even bigger issue when you realize that ROBLOX only requires a phone number to have voice chat, which means there are so many alts around with nefarious persons going around, having the freedom to say virtually anything with no consequences, because their account just so happened to be 13+. (I'll provide examples down in the  comments)

I have no idea where ROBLOX is going with this and if I could remove my age verification I would do it in a heart beat because I can't even say something normally in chat to my friend without being slammed with a 1 day ban and being forced to appeal over and over again. I don't know what to do and I wanted age verification because I just wanted to be able to swear with my friends, but it quickly turned into the inability to even say ANYTHING in chat. If you're considering doing age verification, I honestly wouldn't. There's really nothing to do and the resulting unintended consequences are bigger than the potential benefits of being able to goof off with your friends.

My department wont allow you out of 20min rehab with a hr over 100, bp over 160/100, or a tympanic temp of 100.1. The leading cause of death for firefighters (out of shape or later in their career) is heart related. I’m 27, otherwise healthy minus an occasional migraine every few weeks and I have been a firefighter less than a year.

With that out of the way, during training essentially doing what was said above minus the heat from a fire, I got extremely light headed, short of breath, extreme fatigue,had chest pain, had vision issues (things going gray, with weird color blobs) lost my balance and fell over. Vitals were immediately taken, I was tachy, with negative orthostatic and a temp of 99.
I have been seeing a cardiologist who did a stress test, echo, carotid artery ultrasound, tilt test, holter monitor, and a cam patch. According to him, all came back normal, and with the small things he noticed he would be surprised if I felt anything. Clear to go back driving ambulances and fighting fire. My neurologist on the other hand said my tilt test results were abnormal. After this I looked at my ekg, as did 5 paramedics and 2 ER doctors, they also said my cam patch results were not normal at all, and neuro is convinced I have some orthostatic intolerance.

Tilt test results: 
-Baseline vitals- bp 117/78, hr 58
-upon standing- hr immediately jumped to 92, I got short of breath, light headed, extreme fatigue palpitations,slight vision changes, felt hot, blood felt like it drained to hands and feet no syncope bp went up to 140/92 pre nitro
-post nitro- light headedness intensified, everything went gray and I felt like I was close to passing out, hr went to 130, couldn’t focus on anything, bp went to 121/81, no syncope. 
Incomplete Right branch bundle block noted. 

Cam patch
I pressed the event recorder every time I felt any of the above symptoms.
 multiple runs of NSVT while sitting at a desk.
Multiple PVC, PJC, and PACs
One instance of a heart rate of 195 while walking at 60 steps/min for 8 min the cardiologist said “ya mine gets kinda high when I’m on the stair master too”, before all of this started I had never seen my heart rate above 170 and that was when I was going all out.
I asked him why 6 months later I still feel symptoms, especially when standing too fast or for too long, and working out at any capacity and his response was “I can tell you everything is fine on my end, I’d say it’s migraine related”

Other things my cardiologist noted on my chart but never brought up.
-tricuspid valve insufficiency 
-material and tricuspid murmur

While I understand some of this may be okay on its own, and some of this may be normal for someone that sits at a desk for work, I am concerned about safely returning to work where I can put myself or others lives in jeopardy if I have more episodes.

I have good days and bad days, but I’ve noticed not eating at a regular time every day, a lack of sleep, exercise, to warm or too long of a shower, standing or walking for long periods of time cause my symptoms to present or worsen.

So I guess my question is, is everything “all good” or is there something going on? Does it seem like POTS(suggested by neuro), or something else?

Edit: I don’t smoke and I don’t drink many energy drinks, my caffeine is usually just a cup of coffee in the morning. Water intake is decent, same with electrolytes.

To try to bridge the two degrees, I joined an accelerator and am currently part of the finalist cohort (not planning to integrate), and I’m also volunteering at another accelerator.

I’ve never worked outside of academia, so I think I have gotten used to just writing essays/showing my stats and cruising. I also luckily have a big family, so I don’t have issues socializing and making friends - it’s actually part of why I started the MBA. 

I’m actively trying to network with all communities and scheduling coffee chats (also cold DMing on Linkedin) but am lost on how to actually land a role/extract real value from the network. I know there’s a skill to this and it’s one that is severely underdeveloped for me. The people I speak to really like me, but after sending the personalized thank you email for their advice, I don’t really know how to go beyond to maintain the connection… 

I’m going join the recruitment cycle within the MBA but was told a lot of people land roles outside of it… Given the state of the US, I’ve been stressing since biotech is probably going to be hit pretty hard…

I have a friend that I love so much living on the other side of Europe. I visited her few weeks ago and I blew it. I felt into depression, told her how sometimes I want to split from here and that I hate her without any reason, I got non-verbal two times which made her annoyed with me because she _she doesn't know what I want from here, when it obviously isn't to talk_. I was not happy. I was so excited for that trip and than my stupid mental health ruined it for both of us.

Last week I went out clubbing with another friend. I met a guy, I feel so pressured to have fun and kiss guys and that should make me feel better. So I let him touch me, even tho I didn't feel comfortable, hoping that the good feeling will come. In never came.

And at least I found out that my sister is pregnant. And happy for the baby. That would be nice if she wasn't 21, with no job, having the baby with her stupid boyfriend who was fined 3 months ago for emotional bullying (she actually reported him to police, after he threatened her), who also doesn't have a job (he has been looking for one for last year, mysteriously having interviews bit not jobs. Except when he got a job and didn't go first day because he had a headache). 


Of course, me and my mum found about the pregnancy through my friend, and not her. I talked to my her and she told me, but today my mum went to get a coffee with her but my sister didn't tell her about pregnancy. So now I feel really bad vibes at home.

I just feel really bad. For everything. I know that I want to hurt myself because I am hurting inside. I hate everything. I hate my job, I hate my friendship situations, I hate that I will become aunt. I really want everything to stop.",4,1743713922.0,BPD,1,1.0,False

I am sry for the long rant.

So i grew up with a narcissist and alcoholic father, who would beat up my mother for even the smallest of things, and back here in india which is still highly uneducated and misogynistic, dowry related deaths and abuse is still quite prevalent, and i vividly remember the constant beatings by my father to me or my mother, grabbing her hair and dragging my mother in the neighbourhood.  My mother had vitilgo and he always thought that he has done a favour by marrying her, although he agreed to it by his own choice. I still remember those days when my mum would go to the office the next day with swollen face and bruises and would come back in the evening and work like a maid to serve hot food to my grand-parents the MOMENT she arrives back home, and then get beaten up by my father at 9-10pm, and then same office routine the next day.

So one day, the beatings got too much and my grandparents came to take my mother back to their home, bcoz here in india police doesnt do shit and I was maybe in the age of 1 or 2, and just as they were taking us away from my father, he snatched me back forcefully and I remember crying my eyes out and shouting for my mothers name while her forehead was drenched in blood, and so for few months i lived with my father and grandma, until my father begged for forgiveness and things went as they were, alcohol, slut shaming my mother and abuses, the beatings continued and only stopped a few years back, near corona. 

So i was seeing a therapist a couple years back and asked her- why havent i ever been in a relationship in life? 

Why dont i talk to women who show interest in me? 

Why dont i have the basic memories of love? 

And she was aware of these numerous childhood traumatic events of mine, so she said that - you were forcefully abandoned by your mother bcoz of your father, you were abandoned by the person a child feels most safe around- mother.  And that left a lasting impression in your subconscious, and you grew up, wondering, what’s wrong with you? Why did your mother abandoned you ?  What was your fault?     It is also the reason why its  so easy for people to bully you or mock you, so you grew up, thinking that what’s the point in forming bonds/relationships with people when in the end, they will eventually leave you.  So you never gave it a try and went ahead or took steps to form bonds with anyone. 

She explained that it’s not my fault, and I have every right to live a loving happy life, and that i should not feel shame or embarrassment to reach out to people. MAN , the moment i heard these lines , i was absolutely stunned and in a mental paralysis, i couldnt say a word.

Well , to this day, i still never initiate convos but deep down i want to, so badly. God works in mysterious ways man, i am thankfully blessed in looks sector and most people think i have fu*kboy vibes but in reality only i know why i havent even held hands with a woman romantically. I do get attention and subtle flirts by women but i do not know how to form bonds, ( I would remember the minutest of details about them- what are the favourite hobbies? What shoes were they wearing? What kind of movie or music genre they like? Their subtle quirks,  coffee from a specific place. Favourite future countries to travel to, what calms them or makes them anxious or happy)

i used to and somewhat still do love to go the extra mile to help people in their life regardless of how mean and rude they are to me, why? Why do i care about their small smiles and happiness when they dont give 2 Fuc*s about me ?  This is the kind of person i have become now.

 Sometimes i wish i was a liar, manipulative A-hole who takes others for granted and deceives them and only care about what i want , i wish i was a selfish prick bcoz in the end - ATLEAST I would have SOME happy memory of someone by fu*king around and  funny that i only see the As*holes are happy in life, they deceive , lie cheat to get what they want. Maybe gods plan, what do i know.

These abandonment issues will be the end of me. 
I am dying to talk with women but i feel so much guilt and shyness now , all these years of being introvert filled with guilt and self loathing has taken a mental toll and now this cage feels heavy. 

Appreciate you reading it all and
Truly sorry for bothering you with my idiotic  useless thoughts.

I had good grades in uni, and finishing my master now. 
We live in one house, but spearated - house has two main doors. I work from 2 pm till 11 pm, 9h shift sometimes 10h depends how much work do I have. 
I was in really bad situation, extreme poverty, there was a period when I didnt had a job, then I got one as a cleaner in the moll, while my mother was in some kind of depression (when I told her mom you have to find a job we are stinking her response was let us stink). she asked me many times to borrow money from her ex husband and I told her how long thus will take and she was like as log as I want, I told that to my father and he stopped giving her money.
Not to mention that I live in the part of the house where I dont have hot wather for showers, we dont have machine for landury and some of the nessesary stuff for normal life - so its poverty. I am  not complaining just to create image for someone who read this to understand. 
I will try to cut this as much as I can. 
The thing is, I found some good paying job, Im paying bills, Im paying part for the food as well, my mother found a part time job to clean and finaly she has her own money firdt time in her life ( i never took penny from her). But i dont give her my all earning bc she would stop working, and I belive she wld come back in the same mental state. Since, I have tricky shift 2 pm 11 pm, I laid on her to make us some food, example dinner or lunch and I was grateful for that (anything). 
the thing is many times, I come home tired extremly and hungry(i dont order food at work and I usually bring food frome home) and there wasnt food, or she locked her door and went to sleep, or there was somethig that really wasnt good. 
and a coupple of times - not every, I told her, using rly nice tone and emotional inteligence that she shld tell me if she doesnt want to cook I would get something in the store, or she could put rice to cook 15 min before I come home and I would take it over, I told her lets be team. 
But each time she would start to yell at me, to argue to fight, even if I tell her mom I dont want to fight ( with pure heart and love) and she wouldnt stop so many times, I would ran from her house into the mine to avoid conflict escalation. sometimes I had a feeling like she enjoy in tension.
Last time wasnt good. I came home exausted 10h shift, was so hungry, no energy at all. she had some situatuon at job and started to make drama and to overthink, and I was like mum you will find somethig else dont worry. I was nice to her. then I saw food what was for me made and I told her nicely rly rly nicely that she could put rice to boil 15 min before I came and I would take over. she started yelling and i told her i dont wanna fight i just asked her to act like team.. then she told me that I am crazy pointing finger in the circles and she didnt want to stop yelling speaking, drama, tension tension.... my mind went dark i pushed her on the floor she then started screaming and yelling and i put my hand on her mouth.. she went to friends house. we dont talk anymore. 
i am awful daughter. awful person.. im really bad human definetly. i am aware how wrong this was, she told everyone. told priest, told her friends, everyone. and I am aware that I am bad but i dont want to have contact with her. im still paying bills, and i see that she has money to get herself super expencive coffee she loves and she has for cigagretts and cloth, so I know she is okay. 
but someone has to understand me, I dont hate my mother, I dont have any negativity thoward her.. When I was younger, super small, she use to beat me a lot to put me under blanket and to beat a hell of me. 
i dont know what to do.. I regret my actions, but I wish I could move and pay rent but I dont have for rent and for her bills.. still dont wanna leave her without support... ",1,1743713829.0,stories,1,1.0,False

I have known I was adopted my entire life, as my parents were very open about my situation. It was a closed adoption - all we ever knew is that my mother was a teenager when I was born. 

Since I am getting older, I decided to go through genetic testing on Ancestry.com and 23 and Me to ensure I didn’t have any genetic mutations that would lead to health concerns. The great news is that I got a clean bill of health from a genetic perspective. I knew, however, that I may have an opportunity to connect with my biological family through this process. 

Yesterday around 12:30, I get a notice that I had a 24% DNA match that is must likely a half sibling. 

At 12:35, I receive a message from her. 

Sure enough, she had known about me since she was 10 and had been looking for me for close to 20 years. She is two years older than me, and we share our biological father. We also shared a sister (my full, her half) who passed away at 28 years old in 2017. Her obituary made me incredibly sad because it was short and impersonal - the comments lead me to believe it was an overdose. She shared some other very sad information about my biological parents - addiction, crime, etc - but thankfully, we both had good upbringings. She with her mother, and me with my adoptive family. I am actually excited to meet her for coffee because she seems like a lovely person. 

It’s a lot to take in - some people would be sad or upset to learn this information. I, however, am choosing gratitude. Gratitude that my biological mother placed me with great parents. Gratitude that my parents raised me with rigor. Gratitude that I had values instilled in me that kept me on the straight and narrow. Gratitude that I had a chance to be successful in life. 

TLDR - for those who are searching , you never know what you will find. You can choose sadness, anger, and bitterness, or you can be thankful for what you have. I chose the latter. This is my reminder to you to find the good regardless of your outcome. ",5,1743713353.0,Adoption,3,0.86,False

Now there are those who will say I've mis labeled this as non-fiction.  I'll only reply, ""One who's lived off tips... Will tip well! For the rest of their days."" No. This being the second story I've ever posted, is all unfortunately very true. You see my Achilles heel. Like many I can only write what I know. Can only draw from what I've ""experienced"". And this, the draft of which I composed while having a rough time of life. First appeared in a Discord thread. So in an attempt to excuse the numerous grammatical errors hereinafter, an now having re-wrote,  I'll simply Title: The Man in the Room... With that...

Hey Guys. This got long as they all do, but is real life. All true, an just seems to ""happen"" to me. Okay prerequisites first,  I'm going up there to see her again. But having arrived late, only to find she's out for another test. Not even a bed in the room, and I can't explain how much I can't stand Hospital rooms! Simply refuse to sit in one when empty. So I go for a walk, take a stroll as it were.  Will most likely just wonder unguided, phone in hand until I meet another warm body or the end of a hallway. No... I expect to find myself pacing like always... On today's random journey I find myself in another building. In an unfamiliar part of the complex. At some point I'll pass a common area, completely absorbed I'll look up. She'll say, Do you need help finding where you're going ? I'll reply, No honestly I'm just taking a walk, but thanks anyways. Simply continued on my way. I Find myself groggily approaching a coffee bar, but alas it's closed for lunch. Think to myself, there is another, although quite a walk I'll just go back an retrace my steps. Like that I turn around and just continue on my journey... Now I pass the same young woman. Again sitting in the same chair. She says to me, still wandering I see? I reply, actually I found myself in need of a cup of coffee and that place is closed sadly. She replies, Actually! That's me, I'm on break right now. I said, In that case, as you can tell I've no where to be, I'll simply grab a seat and wait for you to finish. To keep this from going on till eternity. I'll simply say, We started off as two complete strangers. Began to learn that we were both experiencing a difficult moment, then would begin to bond over conversation. Now while most is of a personal nature and won't be shared. Importantly she'll mention her father is in this same hospital, and apparently... Is in bad shape. Not quite far from where my mother is currently housed. Now while finishing her meal. She'll ask me, How do you take your coffee? Wait for my reply, clean her mess and depart...
I'll catch up with her. Her coffee stand now open, she's prepared my expresso, My mother's Grande drip. Now fishing my wallet I'll simply ask, How much do I owe you? Her reply will unknowingly change the course my first pleasant morning in days... ""Oh you don't owe me. It's on me today""... Abashed, but knowing it would be rude of me to decline. I simply accept and start looking for the tip jar instead. Now the anger starts to come back. There isn't one to be Found?!?! Against ""company policy"". I could write a novel on this subject alone but now isn't the time. Im trying to tell a story after all, so back to it.
But now. Now I'm stuck! And simply don't know what to do, I mean in my book this is just unacceptable. The situation, Must be rectified somehow! But Alas, all I can do, simply apologize, Blush and ask her name. I'll Introduce myself and we'll simply part ways. Now this! Is Not Satisfactory! I don't want to be angry again. That was yesterday, I've been There! And have thankfully come down some by now. I.E. I don't need this shit right now. But fortunately, and as oftentimes will manage to save my rather hairy behind... An idea occurs... An outlandish idea At that... But I'm forgetting key details already. Her name. Was Nikki or Nicole? And worse yet,  her Father. Was it Bruce or Bernard?  No if I'm to follow through with my plan this will all be of critical importance. Last key detail, her father is in Isolation. And this, Certainly! Won't be easy, if at all possible. But determined none the less I make my way to up the ward, approach the nurse's station. Get a quick run down of the details, the rules of this floor. I tell her my story. Nutshelled far better that this, What I'd like to do, and the fact that the gentleman in question is a stranger to me. Now to my complete surprise... It all worked... She was touched, and quickly guided me over to decontamination to begin the process. I think she might have violated a rule herself... Now I'm not kidding here. I knew what I was getting into. Or so I thought anyways. At least twenty minutes later I'm ready. Looking like I'm going perform surgery myself. Guys!?! I'm talking, I had expected the hair net. But had failed to anticipate the beard guard. Or! The track-less booties, or the level of hand washing required. For what was originally supposed to be such a simple task. But now, as geared up as anyone could be. I'm escorted to this gentleman's room, but will have to keep my distance. Rules have been explained, and I'll abide. Now I walk into the room... 
It becomes quite obvious to me this Gentleman. Is Not! Doing well...  Now all this effort, all this time so I could have this moment... and then it occurs to me... I've forgotten something. Overlooked a crucial detail, one that threatens to unravel my carefully laid plan. I realize... I've no idea what I gonna to say to him... I mean it was such a simple idea. If you can't thank her properly? Then go... Thank him instead. But alas in my haste to get up here I'd forgotten to actually come up with something to say... Past, ""You have wonderful daughter"" to which I'd derived while riding the elevator. But now Im here and it's too late. Suddenly time would slow. I'd examine the room. You see I've developed a thick callus shielding me from this place. So I drop my defenses, let it take me. The soft bustle in the hallway. The chirps of various instruments, combined with the sounds of a of a labored breath... The smells take me next,  A combination of industrial strength cleaner mixed with human decay. Finally I'll open my eyes. Only to find myself unprepared for the sheer number of wires, tubes, and hoses that snake around this gentleman, connecting his life to the various machines, I can only assume are there to sustain him . I'll meet his eye and am only returned a thousand yard stare, to which any use of modern vernacular will fail to adequately convey. No his gaze just rips through me, and I'm frozen. Having lost my purpose, I find my steadfast determination quickly fleeting. All that occurred in a moment's time.  But now. Now something takes over. Again a simple thought. Put yourself in his shoes, in that bed. Your last days... Final hours on this Earth... What would you be thinkin? What would you want to hear? Without conscious effort I find my feet are bringing me closer... I'll approach said Gentlemen. Making sure he's aware of my presence and can hear me, and the following just sort of fell out of my mouth. ""Sir You and I have never met Sir. Simply put, I got to meet your daughter Nicole this morning, and I Believe your name is Bernard. Sir I simply came up here to congratulate you. On what a wonderful kind-hearted and beautiful woman that your daughter has become, and to let you know. You did an amazing job helping her become that Woman. So much so, a complete stranger felt the need to go through all this, I'll jester to the garb im wearing. Just to be able to tell you face-to-face. If you are about to meet your end?  You may rest easy, knowing you did it! And because of your efforts, she'll be just fine after your gone""... then I  Then I awoke. Guys, He just broke down, I'm talking major tears. The the water works, whole nine yards. I wasn't going for That! Hadn't expected this?!? He desperately wanted to give me a hug. Asked, begged the nurse for a simple hand shake. But to no avail. Rules, It was to the Point, I was getting uncomfortable. So I just repeated ""Sir I Thank You an I gotta go"" and would simply turn an leave.  While I walked I could only wonder, Was that right? I mean, what did I just do to him?  Doubt has me now, I guess I'll just go walk it off too... While I do hope I was able to find an old man a bit of comfort. No simply I couldn't tip her and it simply bothered me! That Much! 
So with that long-winded tale behind me. I'll leave you for now, and can only wonder what my coffee will be like tomorrow.

(A few days have now passed) I wasn't kidding Guys!?! No before you all think too highly of me. I'm not that good a person. I simply had an obligation to fulfill. A goal that couldn't be left undone. So I don't know, I guess I've been ok... I mean I guess things are on the up an up? No... I've just felt no reason to be here is all. But now I'm back, and I find myself sitting here, trying to compose another story. A part two if you will... No, I've got more time to kill you see, She's out for another test. But it won't come. The ""words"" just aren't flowing today... No I'm sitting here... In this room, an every hospital's got one. You've probably passed it once or twice yourself. This one's called Colwell Chapel, and I've no idea what I am doing here. How do you catholics do that again? North South East West. I think? No... This shit ain't me... I haven't been in one of these places since my Grandfather passed... But I'm here now, sitting not knowing what to do. Not for myself, Oh no!?! I'm here simply because she asked me to come... to ""say"" something. No simply She asked and here I am. And this is the second time she's done this to me, all be it unknowingly so... Not that I'm mad. Just... I already said what I had to say. I don't know... Like I said this just isn't me, I don't belong here... So... Okay guys here goes. The Man in the room part two... This one might be a little shorter...
Rest in Peace.

1jqtjlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1jqtjlp/little_by_little_i_like_me_more/,Little by little I like me more,"Wasn’t sure what to tag but I wanted to put this post somewhere.

I use to be encouraged by people (whether on purpose or accident) to do things that were unhealthy to me and them. I had someone I cared so deeply for tell me they didn’t think I could change. 

I think about that comment often and how cruel it is to be thought of that way.  Younger me acted in the ways I did because I was young, I was uncertain, I was scared, I operated off of unhealthy habits I learned from family, and most importantly I just didn’t know any better. I can’t know any better if I’m not told. I did my best to fix my learned behaviors from family but it was so hard because I didn’t know what tools existed to do better. 

It takes alot to reflect on what I’ve done wrong or could have done better. I’ve had so many uncomfortable conversations with myself, therapists, friends, and family. I was sad the other day and when I reached out to a friend they told me just how much they’ve seen me grow. “(Name) I haven’t known you for long, but the amount of work I’ve watched you put into yourself is admirable. I couldn’t do that at your age. I couldn’t have the conversations you’ve had with yourself, even if I did I certainly couldn’t have the realizations. I’m so proud of you.” 

I’m so proud of you, it makes me want to cry, I become harsh on myself with growth, wishing I had done it sooner or faster, but I wasn’t aware how I needed to grow, even when I wanted to change bad habits I wasn’t aware of the underlying growth I had to commit to. I didn’t know how to change within the space I was in.

And of course I still cry, feel sorry for myself, be mean to me. This is still new and that’s human nature and while growth is not a straight line, it’s still there.

Discovering and dismantling my triggers is really hard, for example when I was little I was sexually assaulted by someone in my family after they drank coffee, coffee and coffee breath is a really bad trigger of mine, and I’m currently working on it now because the person I’m caretaking for loves coffee. But I’m also working on my triggers such as tonal change, volume, etc.

I may never find another person in this universe to love me again, and that’s okay, because I like the person I am/ am becoming to be. That’s so freeing to actually be content with yourself, or content with the person who you’re working to become! I don’t need someone, I want someone. This mentality has been especially powerful in trying to date, I’m not rebounding to the first person to give me attention, I’m actually looking and taking my time. 

Maybe I am just an unlovable ugly creature of a person? I’m not too sure, but I’m at least a an unlovable ugly creature of a person who is has been putting work in to change for the better! My growth has been confirmed by others lol and, most importantly I like me. I actually witnessed my growth for the first time the other day, a major paper was due soon(I’m in grad school), and my laptop slipped, crashed to the floor and the screen cracked. I was calm?? Like I was certainly was shaky but I was calm. I tried to save what I could through the broken screen, I looked up the warranty, I brought my laptop to the place I bought it, went to the library, when I found out my laptop was a goner I asked ‘can i please save my stickers (lol)?’ Then I had to buy a new one! Which sucks but i remained calm. I did have to bust BUTT to get the paper done on time but I did it!! (And I got an A 😎)

Other ways change has some up! The man I’m sort of kinda casually seeing did something to really hurt me. I brought this up to him, we had the most productive conversation ever about it! And he told me “I’m so impressed that you can just tell me things, like obviously you’re mad at me, obviously you’re hurt but you’re not screaming at me.” Like I’ve always been good at communication but at times I’ve struggled because I wasn’t always actually listened to. He and I have had amazing conversations! And like the problem is still a problem but from what I can see he’s actively working through it and I’m giving him the chance to change. (But he’s actively changing so it’s not in vain like I have had in the past) 

At the end, if I’m happily alone, Perhaps one day I can foster or adopt kids. I’ll create my own family, we will live in a beautiful home that’s decorated in wacky and whimsical ways. I will have pet chickens and cats and an old dog named something silly. When I’m old I’ll sit in my porch swing(probably listening to Taylor swifts 100th album) and as I wait for grandkids to come over. I’ll be happy, I can reflect on my life and know that I had always done my absolute best with the tools I had at the time. Life isn’t about being the best at anything it’s about being content. And I will certainly be content. 

And I thank the universe or whoever may be listening for the trials and challenges I’ve gone through 💖no matter how much they hurt me, no matter how much I hope no one has to go through that, no matter how angry I am that I had to experience it, it helped make me who I am. It helped me learn at the very least. Things will always be okay, because they have to be.",1,1743712697.0,selfimprovement,0,0.67,False

1jqtip8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqtip8,"[Update] the bag that does indeed exist, that checks all the boxes for me","Thanks u/ParamedicEcstatic994 for recommending Canvelle - I had not known about this company, and they make a bag that successfully fulfills all the following criteria, which I put in an earlier post:

* a **tote bag** (backpack/duffel/crossbody ok **ONLY IF** it also can convert to/function as a **shoulder-carry tote bag**) that can fly as an underseat/personal item
* zips shut (no open-top/snap closure)
* holds a 15"" laptop in a separate external compartment
* 2 water bottle pockets
* trolley sleeve/luggage pass-through
* a few color choices other than black/gray would be nice

I bought their Medium Weekender in hunter green, and I really like it. I've used it as an EDC for a few weeks and it's great for that, but today is the 1st day I've tried it for actual air travel. I'm attaching a few photos:

1. Over the shoulder of a 5' tall person (me)
2. With luggage sleeve in action, over a rolling carry-on
3. Back of bag - luggage sleeve visible
4. Inside view of bag with contents (including 15"" laptop in its dedicated pocket)
5. My one gripe. The phone pocket is hidden behind the luggage sleeve, which is certainly a safe location but maybe a little *too* secure: it is kind of fiddly to slip it in and out of there (especially when the bag is full and the luggage sleeve is not in use - gravity means that the sleeve is pulled more taut over the phone pocket). I'm fine with this - I just end up throwing my phone in an interior pocket, like I do with most of my bags.

Also note both exterior bottle pockets in action! I frequently bring both a water bottle and a coffee thermos, and it's nice to have pockets for these on the outside (less risk of accidentally spilling or leaking on the bag's contents).

I also recently used this bag for an actual weekend (non-air travel) trip; it did a great job fitting a whole change of clothes in there.

This bag fulfills all of my very specific criteria! Quality material, looks great, feels great. Totally recommend. ",64,1743712637.0,HerOneBag,7,0.98,False

But determined none the less I make my way to up the ward, approach the nurse's station. Get a quick run down of the details, the rules of this floor. I tell her my story. Nutshelled far better that this, What I'd like to do, and the fact that the gentleman in question is a stranger to me. Now to my complete surprise... It all worked... She was touched, and quickly guided me over to decontamination to begin the process. I think she might have violated a rule herself... Now I'm not kidding here. I knew what I was getting into. Or so I thought anyways. At least twenty minutes later I'm ready. Looking like I'm going perform surgery myself. Guys!?! I'm talking, I had expected the hair net. But had failed to anticipate the beard guard. Or! The track-less booties, or the level of hand washing required. For what was originally supposed to be such a simple task. But now, as geared up as anyone could be. I'm escorted to this gentleman's room, but will have to keep my distance. Rules have been explained, and I'll abide. Now I walk into the room... 
It becomes quite obvious to me this Gentleman. Is Not! Doing well...  Now all this effort, all this time so I could have this moment... and then it occurs to me... I've forgotten something. Overlooked a crucial detail, one that threatens to unravel my carefully laid plan. I realize... I've no idea what I gonna to say to him... I mean it was such a simple idea. If you can't thank her properly? Then go... Thank him instead. But alas in my haste to get up here I'd forgotten to actually come up with something to say... Past, ""You have wonderful daughter"" to which I'd derived while riding the elevator. But now Im here and it's too late. Suddenly time would slow. I'd examine the room. You see I've developed a thick callus shielding me from this place. So I drop my defenses, let it take me. The soft bustle in the hallway. The chirps of various instruments, combined with the sounds of a of a labored breath... The smells take me next,  A combination of industrial strength cleaner mixed with human decay. Finally I'll open my eyes. Only to find myself unprepared for the sheer number of wires, tubes, and hoses that snake around this gentleman, connecting his life to the various machines, I can only assume are there to sustain him . I'll meet his eye and am only returned a thousand yard stare, to which any use of modern vernacular will fail to adequately convey. No his gaze just rips through me, and I'm frozen. Having lost my purpose, I find my steadfast determination quickly fleeting. All that occurred in a moment's time.  But now. Now something takes over. Again a simple thought. Put yourself in his shoes, in that bed. Your last days... Final hours on this Earth... What would you be thinkin? What would you want to hear? Without conscious effort I find my feet are bringing me closer... I'll approach said Gentlemen. Making sure he's aware of my presence and can hear me, and the following just sort of fell out of my mouth. ""Sir You and I have never met Sir. Simply put, I got to meet your daughter Nicole this morning, and I Believe your name is Bernard. Sir I simply came up here to congratulate you. On what a wonderful kind-hearted and beautiful woman that your daughter has become, and to let you know. You did an amazing job helping her become that Woman. So much so, a complete stranger felt the need to go through all this, I'll jester to the garb im wearing. Just to be able to tell you face-to-face. If you are about to meet your end?  You may rest easy, knowing you did it! And because of your efforts, she'll be just fine after your gone""... then I  Then I awoke. Guys, He just broke down, I'm talking major tears. The the water works, whole nine yards. I wasn't going for That! Hadn't expected this?!? He desperately wanted to give me a hug. Asked, begged the nurse for a simple hand shake. But to no avail. Rules, It was to the Point, I was getting uncomfortable. So I just repeated ""Sir I Thank You an I gotta go"" and would simply turn an leave.  While I walked I could only wonder, Was that right? I mean, what did I just do to him?  Doubt has me now, I guess I'll just go walk it off too... While I do hope I was able to find an old man a bit of comfort. No simply I couldn't tip her and it simply bothered me! That Much! 
So with that long-winded tale behind me. I'll leave you for now, and can only wonder what my coffee will be like tomorrow.

(A few days have now passed) I wasn't kidding Guys!?! No before you all think too highly of me. I'm not that good a person. I simply had an obligation to fulfill. A goal that couldn't be left undone. So I don't know, I guess I've been ok... I mean I guess things are on the up an up? No... I've just felt no reason to be here is all. But now I'm back, and I find myself sitting here, trying to compose another story. A part two if you will... No, I've got more time to kill you see, She's out for another test. But it won't come. The ""words"" just aren't flowing today... No I'm sitting here... In this room, an every hospital's got one. You've probably passed it once or twice yourself. This one's called Colwell Chapel, and I've no idea what I am doing here. How do you catholics do that again? North South East West. I think? No... This shit ain't me... I haven't been in one of these places since my Grandfather passed... But I'm here now, sitting not knowing what to do. Not for myself, Oh no!?! I'm here simply because she asked me to come... to ""say"" something. No simply She asked and here I am. And this is the second time she's done this to me, all be it unknowingly so... Not that I'm mad. Just... I already said what I had to say. I don't know... Like I said this just isn't me, I don't belong here... So... Okay guys here goes. The Man in the room part two... This one might be a little shorter...
Rest in Peace.

1jqt4v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jqt4v6/gentle_reminders/,Gentle Reminders,"It started with little things. I'd lock the doors before bed, yet wake to find the back door slightly ajar. I blamed myself at first, exhaustion from work clouding my memory. But soon, the changes became harder to ignore.

I moved to the Appalachians after everything fell apart back in the city—relationships, job, my sanity. I thought solitude might heal what therapy couldn't. The old cabin, isolated in dense forest miles from the nearest town, was perfect. Rustic charm mingled with practicality; no distractions, no complications. Or at least that’s how it seemed in the bright sunlight of moving day.

For weeks, the isolation felt therapeutic. I chopped firewood, hiked trails, and began a journal to track my progress. Days were productive, but nights brought restlessness. Even then, I dismissed it as residual stress, expecting it to fade over time.

Then the small disturbances began. One morning, I found my coffee mug shattered neatly in the sink, arranged almost deliberately, as if someone took the time to position each shard carefully. Unease crept into my daily routine. But logic overruled suspicion. I was alone, miles from anyone. Who could be responsible if not me?

Another day, my bookshelf appeared reorganized—alphabetically by author, something I'd never bothered to do myself. The precision disturbed me deeply. I double-checked the doors, the windows. Everything seemed secure, untouched.

Sleep became elusive, slipping away just as I started drifting. Nights blurred into anxious vigils, my ears straining at every small sound in the dark cabin. Soon, even the comforting chorus of cicadas and distant owls felt sinister.

As weeks turned into a month, photographs on my walls began shifting subtly overnight. Familiar, smiling faces of friends and family turned slightly away, eyes cast downward as if avoiding my gaze. The silence around me grew thicker, pressing against my chest. I stopped going into town altogether, afraid to see other faces, afraid to voice my concerns aloud.

Then came the notes.

One morning, bleary-eyed from another sleepless night, I stumbled into the kitchen to find a handwritten note on my table. The script was shaky, unfamiliar: ""You forgot again."" My pulse raced. I searched the cabin frantically. Under beds, inside closets, behind curtains—nothing. I was alone. Always alone.

In desperation, I installed cameras around the cabin, determined to find answers. Yet reviewing the footage revealed nothing but hours of silence and empty rooms. Somehow, the anomalies continued, quietly mocking my futile attempts to catch the perpetrator.

Paranoia took root, isolation gnawing at my sanity. Shadows morphed into figures, whispers filled every silent pause. I stopped trusting my own senses. The journal entries, once clear and precise, descended into chaotic scrawls. Days merged into indistinguishable loops of confusion and dread.

Then, one night, another note appeared on my pillow:

""Don't look under the floorboards.""

Of course, I had to.

My breath shallow and rapid, I pried up the old wood with trembling fingers. Dirt, nothing more. Confusion swept over me. As I moved to replace the boards, a glint caught my eye—paper, yellowed and brittle, tucked just beneath the dirt.

Dozens of notes in my own handwriting emerged, each identical to the ones scattered around the house. The dates spanned months, even years, each bearing the same chilling message:

""You forgot again.""

A cold sweat trickled down my spine as I leafed through the notes, disbelief clouding my vision. The realization was dizzying, overwhelming. How long had this cycle repeated itself? How long had I been trapped in this nightmarish loop?

Then, footsteps. Soft, deliberate. The boards creaked gently behind me.

I turned slowly, dreading the inevitable.

A figure stood at the edge of the shadows, watching silently—me, yet twisted, distorted by shadows and something darker. Eyes hollow and empty, mouth curled into a knowing, mocking smirk.

“We do this every night,” it whispered softly, stepping forward with an unnatural grace. “You always forget.”

As my doppelganger reached out a cold, clammy hand toward me, clarity struck like lightning: This isolation had never been therapeutic—it had been a prison, one of my own creation.

And tomorrow, I'd forget again.

1jqt435,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqt435,Don't Hire Garfield & Sons to Paint Your House,"My mom hired Garfield & Sons to paint her place on the recommendation of a couple of her friends. While they've done a nice job of the painting itself and power washed her path and driveway prior to painting, that's kinda all the nice things I can say about them.

The previous paint on my mother's house was old and flaking off so when they power washed it all the paint came off in flakes, some big and some teeny tiny. If it were me, I would have seen it happening and put down a tarp so it could be easily cleaned. They did not do that. They just went ahead and power washed the whole place leaving paint chips absolutely everywhere.

When I asked Mom if they were planning to clean them up she told me Mr.Garfield said they'd just break up and dissipate on their own. Which is an absolutely wild  answer. I assume the paint is acrylic so that means just a ton of microplastics in our yard and garden beds. And then of course, washing out into the drainage as well. The lack of care for the environment absolutely blows my mind.

After they were finished painting my mother asked again for them to clean up the mess. In the end she had to withhold a small final payment in order to get them to comply. They very grumpily cleaned up, but the pictures I've attached were taken AFTER that. So as you can see there's still A LOT of work for me to do in order to clean this all up.

A few fun bonus reasons not to hire these guys:

-they spilled coffee in my mom's washing machine and neither cleaned it up or told her about it. Now the inside is stained and smells like coffee.
-They broke several things that they shouldn't even have been near such as a light fixture INSIDE the house where they weren't even working.
-they left my the carport door open at all times and then would smoke or have a generator running in the carport. So my mom's house was freezing and full of fumes.

The final picture shows their website where they say they are clean, careful, respectful , professional and that they don't smoke. It feels like that could use an update.

TLDR:
These guys paint fine, but left a huge mess behind, broke a bunch of stuff, and could have killed my mom with gas fumes. Maybe skip them and pick another company.",0,1743711681.0,VictoriaBC,10,0.41,False

Anyway, I'm sitting  there waiting for my mate when a couple come along with what appeared to be a new born baby, all the women stop talking, nearly spitting the coffee and cake out of the mouths in unision.They just wanted to congratulate the couple and admire said newborn, which they did in the typical (lovely way that Irish mammies do) way.

Now you'd say what's funny about that?

As I said, there was four of them, the first three got up and did the usual, ""ah she's the image of her grandmother /postman"" etc. 
But when number four stood up, the chair was attached to her arse, she couldn't get out of the chair, it was clinging on to her like a clamp. Her friend tried and eventually did manage to pull it from her.

I had a baby on 11/02 by cesarean section, he was extremely premature and unfortunately after 17 days he passed away, I didn't breastfeed, I only collected the milk a few times a day (it leaked a lot too)
Now I'm 51 days postpartum and scared of being pregnant again because I haven't had my period yet.

Context of my last pregnancy: I got pregnant using a condom and having coitus interruptus, sometimes we did anal and he ejaculated inside (sometimes he didn't ejaculate), we think there might be some connection

Current context: we haven't had vaginal penetration yet, about 2 weeks after giving birth I gave him oral (he ejaculated and cleaned himself) then we had anal intercourse (he stopped and ejaculated in the bathroom and cleaned himself) the next morning anal intercourse again (he also didn't ejaculate and ended up in the bathroom) the next day I had bleeding (maybe still related to the birth?), about a week later I had discharge like coffee grounds in large quantities 
After my baby's death, I returned home and we had anal intercourse only once (I was approximately 25 days postpartum) also without ejaculation. A few times since then my husband ""rubbed himself"" but without any type of penetration, one of the times in the morning after I had done oral and he ejaculated the night before.
The point is that until now I still haven't had a period, since the last time mentioned we haven't had any kind of relationship, I've been experiencing cramps (which I don't know if they still came from the cesarean section, my recovery was quick and very good)

Today I started using the monthly injection, I informed the doctor about my fear and he said that without penetration/ejaculation I didn't need to take a pregnancy test before starting, but I'm still very paranoid
I can't even consider having relationships because of fear, the fear is not just because the cesarean section is very recent, but because of the fear of everything happening again and another innocent little angel ending up suffering like my son suffered.

I'm thinking about taking a pregnancy test out of a sense of relief, but it gives me despair just remembering the test with which I discovered my first pregnancy (which I also did out of conscience because I thought it was impossible to be pregnant, but I was)

I have been taking antidepressants (amitriptyline) for more than 30 days 

I went to a psychologist once after what happened, but I still haven't mentioned the fear of getting pregnant again, I'm also seeing a psychiatrist

Anyway, it's a question and a rant at the same time, maybe I'll find a similar experience here and some advice
