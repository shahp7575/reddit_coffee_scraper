I tried posting in r/nutrition just to have my post removed for being 'a serious medical issue that I should see a doctor about' which I don't think is the case at all lol. Anyway I woke up super thirsty and without thinking downed a litre of chocolate milk, half a litre of green smoothie and a small iced coffee. I usually only drink these high sugar drinks in small amounts but I didn't even think about it I was so thirsty. Then afterwards I kind of had a dawning realisation and calculated that I'd consumed just short of 200% of the daily recommended sugar. So now I'm freaking out and also concerned because I usually do try and have some sugar throughout the day to give me energy but I'm thinking I've had so much already but it's gonna be really hard to avoid it for the rest of the day. Should I be worried? Is it okay for me to have a small amount throughout the rest of my day? I'm talking like 1/4 of a teaspoon when I drink tea. I'm not gonna eat anything that isn't zero to low sugar. Probably just eggs and I'll make a vegetable stir-fry with rice later. Also to clarify this isn't a regular occurrence I think I was just so thirsty because I fell asleep dehydrated.",1,1740823818.0,caloriecount,0,1.0,False
1j0wbgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1j0wbgv/i_m25_have_15_years_of_situationship_where_should/,I (M25) have 1.5 years of situationship. Where should I go from here?,"Hey Reddit,

I need to get this off my chest and maybe get some advice.

I've been in a situationship with a girl for about 1.5 years. We're both 25, she's actually three months older. From the start, she told me it wouldn't work out, but we kept seeing each other. She's good in many ways and honestly, she's 'wife material' in a lot of senses. We also have a good physical connection (Yeah, I know, that complicates things.)

**Problem:**

The problem is, it was always on her terms. She'd call when it suited her, and whenever I suggested going out for something simple, like shopping or just getting coffee, it was always a struggle. I started feeling like I wasn't a priority, and honestly, I was confused.

**Probable reason for above problem:**

She had a major work issue that was stressing her out, and I held on, thinking things would improve once that was resolved. It took a year, but it did get better. But then, family issues popped up, and she's back to being stressed and unhappy(most times). I care about her, but her mood swings and the lack of time she has for me is draining.

I noticed after work issue was resolved, she tried making minimal efforts for me, I was happy to see that but soon after that she shifted with her family and we didn't get much time together.

**Instead of dragging it further, we called it off mutually (after around 1.7 years).**

Here's where it gets even more complicated: We're in touch and 2-3 times spent some time together. In the middle of this, she actually asked me if we should take it to marriage as her family was seeing matches and her too. I backed off at that time. Honestly, I needed more time. I was still unsure if I'd continue to get the same cold treatment even if we were officially together. Also, I'll be honest, she gained some weight, and that was also a factor in my hesitation. She's against weight training and she has sleep issues due to which her health is getting affected. Still she doesn't try the things I tell her.

I think it's not a healthy situation if she is almost never agreeing with me and I can't do anything about it. I like her, but I don't know if I can keep dealing with this. I also know she'd love to be close to my family, as her extended family isn't very supportive, and my family is.

**Summary:**  
Initially good, it became one-sided, leading to confusion. Her stress (work/family) caused mood swings and less time for me. We mutually ended it after 1.7 years, but stayed in touch. She then proposed marriage, which I declined due to doubts about her treatment and her health habits (weight gain, resistance to change). Now, she's looking at marriage proposals but even she is in dilemma as she still tells me she likes me but don't want to take risk. To be honest, I am her backup I feel in some way.

Has anyone been through something similar? I can try and get her back but I'm not sure if we both will be happy together.",1,1740823749.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False

I've been wracking my brain, googling, reading old forum posts, and looking through YA lists all night trying to remember this one book I read when I was younger. I can't remember the title or the name of the MFC BUT I do remember a few things:

1: The cover had an image of a girl with dark hair and purple eyes. I believe the title started with 'Re' (I want to say Redemption, but I'm not finding anything under that so I'm not sure.)

2: She has electric powers, and I believe those powers progress into her being able to teleport later on.

3: She shorts out a computer room at school when she catches her boyfriend cheating on her.

4: She shorts out an espresso machine while in a beachside coffee shop with her best friend after a day of shopping.

5: She has a light blue Jeep (I think) that her friends and ex (aforementioned boyfriend) didn't want her to buy but she did it anyway.

6: Her powers lead her to meet a boy named Declan who she has a bit of a relationship with later on. He dresses kinda like someone in the military (I remember him being described that way).

I know it's not much to go on but if anyone has ANY idea what book I'm talking about, I would be very grateful if you could share it with me. I'm hoping I can find this book again because I miss it dearly.

Just ask the geospatial whiz kids combining AI and GIS (Geographic Information System). Whether it's predicting landslides or spotting red flags in climate risks, AI teamed with GIS isn’t simply data crunching—it’s scarily prophetic. It's like having a crystal ball, but instead of keeping it in a dusty attic, you're running it on a slick interface, spotting weather patterns, deforestation, or even that new coffee shop opening around the corner.

**The Science of Prediction—Now With Maps!**

Remember those sci-fi films where computers predict the future? We’re living it. When GIS cozies up with AI, they deliver location intelligence at a scale that would make even Nostradamus consider a career change. Take AT&T for example—they’re mapping out flood risks decades ahead. Or, maybe you've heard of FedEx? They're one step ahead, predicting aircraft maintenance well before a wheel touches down.

**Automate to Elevate**

Let's face it, manual labor is so 2019. With AI, those tedious data analysis workflows now handle themselves, freeing up brainpower for the important stuff—like figuring out which AI-generated meme will trend next.

**Real-Life Case Studies that Aren’t Just Clickbait**

Microsoft’s earth-shaking land cover map? A massive leap in understanding human impact on our planet. And the Army Corps of Engineers, saving a cool $100 million annually by predicting where ports need dredging? AI is not just a tool; it's practically an organizational superhero.

**ArcGIS: The Platform with AI as Its Co-Pilot**

Built by Esri, ArcGIS isn't just your normal map-drawing software. It’s a battle-hardened titan equipped with over 75 pretrained models ready to tackle any geospatial issue you dare throw its way, from detecting power line-threatening vegetation to streamlining your logistics game. And forget about fears over privacy—as AI develops, ArcGIS ensures your data remains under lock and virtual key.

I used to trust that he had some potential to change cause our love felt pure at the start.

5 years later he first showed signs of abuse to now, he had only gotten worse. He choked me out in an argument, got mad at me for getting scared I was gonna die, kicked me out when I confessed to feeling suicidal cause of how he treated me (he said- I should deal with it cause he was feeling suicidal too)

We have so broken up and got back together at least 50 times and its so embarrassing to actually admit that. Hupmh atleast he was hot. One of the best sex I've had! 

But this time, I was prepared. I confessed about my um situation! to my bestfriends. Called in any free DV support lines and got support. Made a list of everything he did to hurt me. Literally over a week, tried hardest to prove to myself how I am blinded by the illusion of a loving/ trusting boyfriend.

So this time the breakup was for me, not an attempt to make him respect my boundaries. He must have felt the different energy. So he showed up at my house. I was so suprised to see him there. Apparently he wanted to know if i wanted to get some food and talk. I said no.

Then he said he just wanted to give me a cuddle, and tell him he would never give up on me, then gave me a whole fantastic chef kiss speech on how he was so sorry and how NOW he was going to change everything and ATLEAST this time he's taking proactive efforts.

I told him- ""good"". So you work on yourself and let me know once you fully rectify every situation, I need proof. Then message me and if I am still available, we might go for a coffee.

I wanted to talk, talk a lot so decided to call him, yes I called my younger self today.

He first told a straightaway no. May be fearful, may be not having enough petrol to travel or spend on coffee or probably insecure about his belly and body shape. I suggested him to take permission and recommendation from his best friend Madhav to which he agreed. And you know what, he cheerfully called me within a few minutes and agreed to meet. 

I asked him to suggest the place to which he replied sugar and spice, I told it is no more now. His face dropped down and became really really sad. I can sense the turmoil in his brain. He might have cried a little because this place was very close to him and he used to take his favourite people there for having pastries, be it his crush on Janmashtami or his best friends for his birthday. He considered it as his second home. I knew how to bring him back to senses and suggested unwind cafe nearer to Ghod dod road because I am aware that he will get confused between citylight, ghod dod and Vesu. He has not travelled much, he has not suffered much. 

And in the evening at sharp 6 pm he came, hiding his belly, hiding his pimples and walking with a broad smile. I went to the place at 5:30 only because I knew he was punctual. He was present at the location at 5:45 pm only as usual and kept waiting downstairs. 

He wore his favourite blue shirt and grey pants, he thought it would help him hide his extra belly fat. Alas! he was wrong, he was really fat but he was honest. He was comparatively happy without any heartbreaks. I gave him the menu card, he loved being a centre of attraction those days. He ordered chocolate brownies with ice cream and gleamed with utter joy. Ordered two and asked me politely. I ordered two slices of pizza. Our favourite till date. Because We+Pizza = together forever. He was skeptical thinking about his body fat but I assured him.  Also, little did he know that those brownies were the main culprit for his weight gain. He was not aware about the concept of sugar cravings, about low carb high protein diet, about the intentions of the people dear to him, about his parents’ financial situation and their hardships, about the heartache he will have, about the heart stroke he will have, about the multiple dengue attacks he will have, about the toe surgeries he will have, about his best friends secret engagement or his younger brother’s marriage. He was there sitting unwavered, unharmed; awaiting his brownies, awaiting his life.

He tried to initiate the conversation and kept looking at my apple gadgets, for him this was his dream. He thought that apple products were made for cream people and not for us. He went through my clothes and shoes. He was amazed by the brands. Still he noticed my dull eyes behind my contact lenses, and scanned my white hair through the broad head. He asked me about our mother and I said she is all okay. I asked what she was making today. He uttered chicken curry, roti and meatballs. My favourite till date but I don’t eat them anymore. I have now turned vegetarian, I have turned barbarian with my own family.

He kept talking about the pressure of his exams, his father’s attitude and his mother’s sacrifices. He asked me about the future. I gave him some positives; the doable salary package, the job in hometown which he wanted, the posh house, loving parents, singlehood and a cute little nephew. He blushed and asked about our marriage, I commented no with an assuring smile and said it will be in our best interest. 

I talked about us being a Chemistry teacher, his weakest subject. Talked about being best friends with wonderful people at multiple job roles. Talked about office politics and heartbreakers, exciting solo trips and sleepless, teary nights. He was shrewd yet sensitive, wasn’t able to digest more and told me to stop. His eyes were wet, his body shaken, he pulled down his shirt and pulled up his pants, he wiped his face with the small hand rolled napkin and took his slingbag to storm out. He literally ran and never looked back. I was sure that he would call his best friend and our mother was there to hold him. I know he will sleep contented and realize it was a dream, he will also skip his meals for a day and again engage with his daily routine, expecting a miracle to happen, expecting to marry with his crush, expecting his best friend to be his side forever, expecting to earn much for his parents and family. 

I wished him the deepest regards and cried with the sharpest guards.

1j0vu8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1j0vu8p/the_road_above_town_was_off_limits_now_i_know_why/,"The road above town was off limits, now I know why","I stared at the gate blocking our way. Jayden joined me, he kicked the shiny yellow DNR gate in disgust. “Well now what? I thought you said this was an open trail”. 

It had been. I thought too myself, I had lived in this town for twenty years before going to college. In all that time there had never been gate on Rams Ridge Trail. Why would there be? No one traveled it.  Sometimes kids would brag that they walked up the trail a little ways but that was just dumb high school stuff. 

The door to my old suburban creaked open, Jayden and I’s friend Madison climbed out of the old lifted square body. 

“What’s with the gate?” she asked. Jayden shot me an annoyed look, and deservingly so, this whole trip was my idea. We had drove seven hours to check out the trail. “We’re not sure yet” he told her. 

Boyd, Madison’s cousin and the final member of our team joined us. He was the oldest of the group by a year even if he rarely acted like it. “What’s stopping us from going around it?” Boyd asked. 

I looked at the deep ditches carved into either side of the road. My suburban might have been able to traverse the drop but there was no way Jayden’s Subaru Impreza would. 

“Isn’t that illegal? Like what if someone saw us?” Madison asked. I glanced at Jayden “we do have some tools, I mean I checked thoroughly. It’s public land and it’s open to dispersed camping”. Jayden raised an eyebrow at me “are suggesting we cut the lock? That’s mighty bold Carter”. 

He was right, the thought of it made my stomach turn. I tended to follow rules pretty strictly. But we had come all the way from our university in Oregon to my home town in Arizona just to explore this trail. Giving up now would mean wasting our spring break. 

And it would mean looking like an idiot in front of Madison. 

How I wished I had listened to my gut. 

But I had done my research, we were allowed to be here. This gate must have been put up by someone trying to keep people off public land. I didn’t see any markings or signs that it was an official DNR gate. “Yeah, grab the grinder. I’ll have it open in a minute”. Jayden grinned, with whoop he ran to the back of the suburban. 

Madison gave me a disapproving look but didn’t say anything when Jayden returned with the cordless cut off tool. True to my word I had the chain off in no time at all. 

Madison and I climbed back into the suburban while Boyd and Jayden got into the Subaru. Rather than take the second captain chair in the front with me Madison choose to lie down on the middle bench. Being just 5’ foot 3” Madison could fit comfortably on the bench. 

I had removed the rear most bench to make room for supplies, Jayden’s Subaru was reliable and a good backup vehicle but it just didn’t have a lot of extra room. When we planned the trip we didn’t know how long it would take, we still didn’t so we had loaded the suburban in preparation for any scenario we might run into. 

Rams Ridge Trail had been around for as long as anyone could remember, yet to my knowledge not a single person had ever traveled the length of it. It lay just a few miles outside the town I grew up in, the sandy path led deep into the Arizona wilderness. Despite being untraveled the road was surprisingly clear of brush and rocks.

Putting the suburban in gear I pulled forward onto the forbidden path. Madison spoke up from the back “so what’s up with this place?” I adjusted the rearview mirror to where I could see her. She was still laying on the bench but had rolled onto her side her head propped up by her arm. Those big brown eyes caused my heart rate to involuntarily increase.

“Uh it’s just something that’s always been there, legends say it’s haunted. I’m not sure how the rumors got started”. She made a mock scared face “oh no, not ghosts!” I chuckled. Madison tossed her phone onto the floor “there goes cell service”. 

“I’m surprised you had it this long” I replied. Madison climbed between the front seats and happily plopped into the passenger seat. Propping her feet on the dash she looked over at me. “Let me get this straight, your town has mysterious trail leading into the desert and no one has bothered to check it out?” she had a doubtful look on her face. I shrugged “I can’t say no one has explored it, after all someone must have built it. But I don’t know of anyone that has or even anyone that claims to have done it”. 

Madison pondered my answer “but then where do the ghost stories come from?” I was silent, she had a point. “I guess I never thought about it”. 

The miles flew by as we cruised across the flat sand. Madison spoke up pulling me from my day dreams. “What?” I asked having completely missed her question. “Can I drive?” I looked at the road ahead, it was more of the same easily navigable smooth sand as far as I could see. “Yeah, why not?” 

We swapped positions, Madison practically bouncing with excitement put the old suburban into gear. After just a few minutes she was comfortably cruising along. When the sun began to set we decided to stop at a wide spot in the road. There was plenty of room to set up tents next to our vehicles. 

Later that evening as we sat around a small fire enjoying a couple adult beverages Jayden spoke up. “You know for all the hype this trail has been pretty tame”. Bodie nodded in agreement “yeah I was expecting some gnarly off roading, maybe a ghost town, something of interest”. 

“I’m ok with how it’s going, if it turns out to just be a week of hanging out and bombing through the sand that’s fine with me” said Madison. I was glad she was enjoying herself, Jayden and I had gone on a few adventures like this before but this was the first time Madison and Bodie had tagged along. 

Jayden gulped the last of his whiskey before standing “well I’m gonna turn in for the night, you shacking up with me Carter?” I shook my head “nah I’ll use my cot”. Jayden nodded before ducking into his tent.

Jayden and I had brought a tent to share while Bodie and Madison each brought their own. With as tired as Bodie looked I expected him to head in for the night as well but he stayed by the fire. Madison threw a twig at Bodie “go to bed before you fall in the fire”. 

Bodie jerked his head up in surprise. “Nah I’m fine, I’ll stay up”. “Dude you’re falling asleep, I don’t need a babysitter”. Bodie looked between Madison and me, he stood and walked to his tent “what ever Madi”. 

Once Bodie’s tent fell silent I turned to Madison “what was that all about?” I asked. Madison pulled her feet up onto the log we were using as a seat and rested her chin on her knees. 

“Bodie can be a bit over protective. Don’t get me wrong, I love the guy but it’s like he forgets I’m an adult”. I sat there trying to think of what to say. Ignoring my silence Madison continued “my parents were not fans of this trip, they’ve never met you or Jayden and we’re hundreds of miles away. Bodie promised to look out for me and they relented”. 

“Bodie has nothing to worry about, it’s not like you’re up alone. I’m still here”. Madison turned to me an eyebrow raised “why do you think he’s was hanging out so late?” I was a bit surprised “because of me?” Madison nodded, a small smile on her face. “People aren’t blind Carter. They see the way you look at me, the way you always conveniently end up on my team, or in the same vehicle”. 

I was glad for the dim lighting, I was sure my face was red. “So you’re aware that I like you?” Madison kept staring into the fire “yeah”. My heart beat wildly “and..?” the silence stretched out. Finally Madison sighed “And I guess I don’t know how I feel, I like you and consider you one of my closest friends but I’m not sure if I want to push things any farther than that”. It was my turn to sit quietly, I placed a hand on her shoulder “that’s ok, if you want to keep things platonic that’s fine. If you decide you would like to be more than friends you know I’m up for that”. 

Madison leaned against me “thanks Carter, let’s just see how things play out. I’m going to bed now”. I stood with her “yeah we’ve got a lot of ground to cover tomorrow, I’ll see you in the morning”. Madison climbed into her tent while I unfolded my cot. It wasn’t long before I drifted off to sleep. 

I woke to the smell of coffee and bacon, Jayden and Bodie stood by the fire as Madison sat on the log from the previous night wrapped in a blanket. Jayden threw a breakfast burrito at me “good morning sleeping beauty, care to join the rest of us?” I got to my feet and attempted to stretch the stiffness out of my joints. 

“Morning people are mentally unstable” I commented as I dug into breakfast. Bodie dumped the remains of his coffee onto the fire “so what’s the plan?” I glanced at Jayden “I assumed we would follow the trail for two days, if we don’t come across anything we will have plenty of time to get back before the weekend”. Jayden covered what remained of the fire with sand “sounds good to me let’s get a move on”. 

Packing up camp went quickly, soon we were back on the trail. Madison sat in the back still huddled up in a blanket. I couldn’t blame her, the morning had been a lot chillier than expected. Before long the terrain began to change drastically, the trail followed a ravine on one side and a rock wall on the other. 

Our progress slowed but we still managed to cover a dozen miles in less than an hour. By mid day the trail had become narrow to the point I had one tire riding the edge of the ravine and the other side pushing bushes aside. Madison was in the passenger seat acting as my spotter. 

I was concentrating on navigating over a small rock slide when Madison tapped my arm. “What’s up? I asked. “Jayden stopped and he’s flashing his headlights at us”. I put the suburban in park, a hundred yards behind us sat Jayden’s Subaru its headlights flicking on and off. 

Forcing the door open against the stiff bushes I squeezed out. I held the door as Madison followed out my side. 

We walked back to where Jayden and Bodie sat, they were looking over the edge of the ravine. “What’s up?” I asked. Jayden pointed to the jagged snapped off brush “take a peek over the edge” he said. Walking to the edge I looked over, far down below I could make out what looked like an upside down truck resting among the boulders. 

“No way, someone poor bastard went over the edge”.  “It doesn’t look like it’s been there terribly long” said Bodie.  “We should check it out” commented Madison. “I don’t know about that, it’s a long ways down” I replied but Madison was already pulling off her hoodie and planning a route in her head. “Don’t be silly Carter, I’ve climbed cliffs three times that high. What if someone is trapped inside? We can’t just drive away”. 

Before anyone could argue Madison was climbing down the ravine, I knew she was excellent rock climber but this felt stupid. A glance at Bodie told me he felt the same way. Jayden slapped me on the back “come on man, don’t worry. This is the girl that free climbs brick buildings on campus for fun. She knows what’s she’s doing”. 

I nodded, Jayden was right. We couldn’t see Madison anymore but I could still hear her grunts as well as the occasional pebble clattering down the rock face. 

After what felt like a lifetime a metallic thud rang out, I could see Madison walking on the truck. She dropped out of view again as she climbed down beside it. 

My gut twisted, it was too quiet. Something was wrong. A scream pierced the air, a primal scream of pure fear echoed up from below. “Madison!” I yelled her name but there was no reply. 

Not willing to waste another moment I climbed over the edge, I was no rock climber but I couldn’t just stand there. My progress was painfully slow, I was less than ten feet below the top when I heard an electric whine. I looked up to see Jayden was using the winch on his Subaru to repel down the cliff. 

He quickly reached me, Bodie stood at the top with the winch remote in his hand. Jayden rapidly descended past me without pause, seeing that he would reach the bottom first I climbed back to the top. Just as I got back to my feet I heard Jayden yelling from below “up! Up! Up! Pull us up!” panic filled his voice. Bodie reversed the winch, it felt like it was moving painfully slow.

Finally Jayden and Madison appeared, Bodie and I grabbed them and pulled them up the last couple feet. Madison’s face was streaked with tears and Jayden’s eyes were wide with terror. 

“What the hell happened?” I demanded. Madison didn’t reply, she walked away from us before stopping to retch in the bushes. Jayden grabbed the front of my shirt and used it to pull himself up. “There’s a body man, there was a freaking body hanging out of the truck. It looked like he was halfway out of the window when it landed, the roof collapsed pinning him there. But something got him, something split his head in half like machete through a watermelon!” Jayden looked me dead in the eye “I don’t think Madison saw it but there was teeth marks on the edge of the skull. Like something was nibbling on him, sucking his brain out”. Jayden glanced at the edge his voice coming out as a barely audible whisper “something was moving down there”.

“Alright, we need to go back. We need to call the police” said Bodie. I nodded and Jayden jumped into his car. I heard it click multiple times, Jayden beat his head against the steering wheel. Opening the door he called out “the battery is dead, we ran the winch for too long without it running”. 

“I’ve got jumpers in my suburban” even as the words left my mouth I knew it wouldn’t work. There was no way to turn around and the cables were too short to reach from the front of my truck to Jayden’s car. 

Jayden climbed out of his car “ok everyone get in the suburban, we’ll keep going until we find a place we can turn around”. There was an urgency in his voice that got us all moving. Bodie helped Madison into the back, Jayden and I got into the front. I dropped it into gear and pulled ahead a bit faster than I should have. 

Bushes scraped the side of my suburban as I avoided the edge of the ravine, the panic radiating off Madison and Jayden was contagious and I found myself driving way too fast nearly sending is all to our deaths more than once. 

Still I pushed the old Chevy hard, it bounced and clawed it’s way up the now rocky incline. We crested the top of the final hill, I rolled to a stop. Spreading out in front of us was an endless labyrinth of canyons and ravines.

I put the truck in park and shut off the engine, the area was silent save for the heavy breathing of my companions. 

I turned to look back at Brodie, he cradled Madison’s head in his lap. Her tear streaked face broke my heart. I had never seen her so scared and broken. 

Jayden was first to break the silence “I think we should set up camp”. Madison shot up in surprise “are you crazy?” she demanded “you saw the same thing I did right? We need to get out of here!” 

Jayden nodded solemnly “yeah, and I want to get out of here as badly as you do. But we don’t have enough time before sunset to make it all the way back. That trail is bad enough in the day, I don’t want to try it at night. And I really don’t want to be trying to jump start my car above that body in the dark and then try to back it down the trail”. 

Madison laid her head back down on her cousin. Bodie placed a protective hand on her “I think you’re right Jayden, but let’s all sleep inside the suburban. It’ll be tight but I don’t feel like going out there”. 

No one else felt like going outside either, so we laid out our bags and stacked in four wide. I was on one side, Madison and Bodie were in the middle and Jayden on the far side. No one complained about the lack of dinner or cramped conditions. Despite the excitement earlier I felt myself drifting off rather quickly. 

I woke with a bit of a start, my eyes looking around the darkness trying to decipher what woke me up. I nearly jumped out of my skin when I saw Madison’s wide open eyes staring at me. 

I tried to slow my beating heart “dang Madison, you scared me” I whispered. Madison slowly blinked her eyes still locked in mine. “We aren’t getting out of here” she whispered in a low voice her gaze never breaking. 

I propped myself up the best I could without rocking the truck. “Of course we are, tomorrow at first light we’ll back track and…” Madison pressed a finger to my lips.

She leaned in close and whispered directly into my ear “I haven’t slept a wink Carter, I’ve been laying here watching them walk around us. We are going to die and they’re going to eat our brains”.

I leaned back slowly looking at Madison with horror, her eyes were bloodshot and wild looking. A shadow passed over us, I fought the urge to spin around. Instead a started to slowly roll over but Madison paced a hand on my cheek “don’t” she had tears spilling down her face again “please don’t, they like it when you look at them”. 

Madison buried her head in my chest and I held her as silent sobs shook her body. At some point I fell asleep again, I woke to sunlight peering through the windows. I looked around quickly locating everyone. Once I made sure we were all accounted for I relaxed some. 

The previous nights events felt like a bad dream. I hoped that’s all they were. I gently shook Madison, waking up she gave me a sleepy smile. For a brief moment I saw my friend once again, looking around her face filled with terror again. She threw off her sleeping bag and roughly kicked Bodie “hey guys, let’s get up and get out of here”.

Bodie grumbled angrily but choose to release his temper but violently stuffing sleeping bags back into their sacks. Jayden sat up, his shaggy hair nearly covering his eyes. Choosing to skip breakfast we set out once again. I found an intersection of canyons that was large enough to back into and turn the suburban around. 

I retraced our tracks from the day before at a much saner speed. Madison rode in the front with me, her feet on the seat and arms wrapped around her knees she scanned the road ahead vigilantly. For what I wasn’t sure but it seemed to bring her some comfort. 

Jayden sat in the far back deep in his own thoughts leaving just Bodie to talk to. Not having much in common we ended up driving in silence. 

I don’t know how we didn’t die the previous day, I carefully navigate the large vehicle over rocks and down ledges until around noon. Finally I spotted a little blue car ahead. “Hey guys we made it, there’s Jayden’s car”. 

Rather than the excitement that I expected the air in the suburban grew heavy with nervousness. Madison began to fidget with her hair while Jayden looked back and forth between the side windows.

Pulling up to the Subaru I pulled the hood latch and stepped out of the suburban. Bodie came around the other side with the jumper cables. I looked back at the suburban to see Jayden and Madison peering out the window at the abyss next to us. I made sure not to get close enough to the edge to see the crushed truck below. Even though I knew I wouldn’t be able to see the body I didn’t want to chance it. 

With the jumper cables hooked up Jayden’s Subaru came to life as Bodie turned the key. I slammed the hood shut and walked to the back of the suburban, opening the back door I threw the cables in. “Are you good to drive?” I asked him. 

Jayden nodded and climbed out “yeah I’m good, I’m ready to get out of here”. 

As I closed the back doors Jayden shoved into me hard, my face bounced off the metal and I felt a tooth break. I turned around pissed off and ready to fight. 

Jayden was looking up the road while clawing for the door handle blindly. A tall man was running towards us, no it wasn’t a man. It was humanoid but it was clearly not a human.

It was nude, it’s skin a pale tan and like that of a reptile. It’s head was nearly encompassed by two massive eyes that reflected darkly. It’s mouth was not overly large but it had many needle like teeth that were barred at us. It’s long arms ended in duel scythe like blades rather than hands. 

Just as the creature was about to leap on us Jayden abandoned his attempt at fleeing and spun around to face the hellish creature. Grabbing a stone Jayden swung at the thing, the rock bounced off its thick hide. The creature lashed out with one of its bladed arms splattering my face with my friends blood.

Jayden was thrown into me nearly knocking me to the ground, as I caught him a high pitched yell rang out. Madison charged past us with a camp shovel held high. She brought it down in the creatures head! The creature stumbled back, as it stepped closer to the edge Madison swung the shovel in an upward arc catching the creature under its jaw. 

It howled as it stumbled over the edge of the cliff. It managed to catch it’s self with a single bladed hand, Madison brought the shovel down in it’s head again causing it to lose it’s grip. I swear at that moment, standing there looking over the edge, shoulders squared and hair a mess Madison was the sexiest thing I had ever seen.

Suddenly Jayden began to scream in a way I had never heard a human scream before, his body started convulsing in my arms. Brodie shoved me aside and grabbed Jayden “grab it! We need to go!” Brodie yelled. 

Confused I looked to where Brodie was pointing, I couldn’t understand it at first. A couple feet away in the blood soaked sand lay most of an arm. I looked at Jayden and saw Brodie doing his best to tie a tourniquet around the stub that had once been Jayden’s right arm. It now ended a couple inches above his elbow. 

I staggered towards to the severed limb, it was disturbingly heavy. I nearly dropped it as it flopped in my hand. Brodie was screaming at Madison as he drug Jayden into the back of the suburban.

Madison had her back turned to the edge, the creature was behind her. It’s blade held high ready to decapitate her! Without thinking I threw the arm, it flew over Madison and slapped the creature in the face. It paused its attack just long enough for Madison to run to the suburban. 

I ran past the open drivers door ignoring Brodie’s increasingly panicked screams. I was not going to drive back to those canyons, somehow I knew if we went back we would never get out.

I jumped into the driver’s seat of the Subaru, I put it in reverse and dropped the clutch at full throttle. The car launched backwards towards the cliff, I rolled out just as it went over the edge. “Sorry Jayden” I murmured hoping Jayden would have the chance to be mad about his car when this was an over.

Getting to my knees I saw my suburban barreling towards me! I managed the grab the bull bar and throw myself onto the hood. Brodie was behind the wheel and he wasn’t slowing for anything. A glance behind the suburban was all I needed to know why. 

The creature was in fast pursuit, it howled with rage as it tried to keep pace. I clung to the roof rack as best I could. Brodie seemed to have the suburbans throttle to the floor with no intention if letting up.

My heart skipped a beat each time the big old truck grazed the cliff side or bounced dangerously close to the edge.

After what felt like ages Brodie slowed enough for me to climb in through the passenger window. Madison and I kept watch out the back windows while trying to tend to Jayden. Brodie kept up the fast pace even when we hit the sand that marked the beginning of the trail. 

I sighed in relief as the yellow gate that marked the start of our cursed journey came into sight. Someone had closed it again after we went through. Luckily it wasn’t chained shut because Brodie didn’t even slow down. 

After crashing through the gate Brodie pulled onto the asphalt and gave the old girl everything she had. We roared down the deserted road as the sun hung low in the sky.

Jayden was moaning incoherently, I kept pressure on his stub in an attempt to slow the bleeding. At some point the tourniquet Brodie had applied had come off and the bleeding had resumed. 

The hospital stay, the police interviews, they all blurred together. I couldn’t even tell you what  happened the first 24 hours we spent in town. 

Brodie is going to pull through, there’s a slight infection but the doctors are confident it’s not serious. 

Strangely the local police turned the investigation over to the park rangers. 

They interviewed each of us separately, I tried to tell them about the monster and the body in the truck but they just cut me off. “Listen kid” said the head ranger “that trail has stood empty for a very long time, we even put a gate up. What happened was self inflicted, I expect you to shut up about it and move on”. 

It didn't sit right with me, Madison later told me the body they saw had a ranger uniform. It didn’t take much digging to see the station had hired a new ranger from out of state a few months back. The website said he had been terminated a week ago. 

There’s something living at the end of the Rams Ridge Trail, maybe more than one. I know I won’t sleep easy until I’m out of this state. ",0,1740821682.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,0.4,False

We hadn’t seen each other when we started talking, eventually after a few convos, the pics were shared and I wasn’t immediately attracted to her but since the conversations were good I kept talking to see where it goes. We then decided to meet in person, again I thought she was okay in terms of looks. I didn’t feel any intense attraction but since her personality traits were decent and we got along well, I continued to get to know her more in the hopes that attraction might build up. We met a few more times for lunch/coffee and always in a public setting. I told her clearly very early on that we should get to know each other better before involving parents but she jumped the gun within a month and out of the blue told her parents about me. She claimed that she did it out of pressure as her parents had found other good proposals for her and were considering another guy seriously for her (I feel she overreacted because her parents were only looking at a proposal and not fixing a wedding date). Anyways, I felt like I was in a position where I could now not refuse to her as I had been speaking and meeting up with her. I had nothing against her either so I told my parents too. The families met and eventually went ahead with a formal engagement. During this time we became long distance as I moved to another country for study.

Initially, when we used to meet up I tried once or twice to talk about feelings, nothing explicit but just a general discussion on how we feel about how things are going between us and if she has any concerns but she would never engage in it and said its not possible for her to be vulnerable in front of me and talk about her feelings. I thought this might change after engagement but we still don’t talk about feelings even though she said she feels more comfortable talking to me about things now that families are involved. Its been a few months since engagement and neither of us has expressed love/affection for each other. 

Additionally, whenever we used to meet up in person, I used to put in so much effort in my looks and dressing while she would put zero effort in her outfit and looks. I never really gave it much thought during that time that why she doesn’t dress up but now I feel like I should have brought this up earlier when we went out. After engagement, I told her that I like dressing up nicely and I admire women who carry that feminine look in themselves and dress nicely, take care of their appearance. She admitted that she never put in effort in her appearance when she came to see me but that’s because she wanted me to see how she looks without make up or fancy clothes. I get someone wanting to do that once or twice but we met a handful of times and she didn’t dress up even once. I told her I like when girls put henna on their hands on Eid etc and she said she doesn’t like that. She also said she thinks that none of this should matter and that I should rather appreciate her for who she is as a person because she doesn’t care how I dress up or look. While I absolutely agree with personality being important…I also think that appearance matters in attraction. How does one feel love and attraction for another person when they don’t put in any effort in their looks? I take care of myself and I stay physically active, I go to the gym and engage in sports regularly while she doesn’t put any effort into her looks, appearance or fitness. I even suggested her that we should have online meetup now where we both dress up and talk on video call since we can’t meet in person, she didn’t oppose the idea but she also hasn’t done it still despite me suggesting this months ago.

Now I’m extremely worried because we are already engaged for a few months and I’m not sure how I still feel about her nor do I know how she feels about me. Secondly, I’m worried that what if time keeps passing by and I’m never able to form attraction for her even after marriage? I wonder if her lack of enthusiasm in dressing up and thinking appearance doesn’t matter would continue in marriage too? I always  imagined my married life where both me and my wife would put in effort in looking good for each other and taking care of ourselves for each other. She is a nice girl otherwise but her not opening up about her feelings and not taking care of her looks really bothers me. I’m terrified of being in a miserable and unsatisfactory marriage.

Kind of generic but it was an older mobile game about running a coffee shop. You bought new recipes, machine upgrades, etc. it had a very beige aesthetic to it. It was almost entirely text based actually, but it definitely had simple visuals as well. 

Random events could happen. I recall an event about a person leaving a bouquet of flowers for you and the local newspaper mentioning your cafe, which would give a revenue boost. 

I remember there wasn't a particular endpoint either, it was just keep upgrading and making money. I had like a billion dollars at one point just from playing for a while, no micro transactions involved. 

Sorry if it's a bit vague, I can visualize it perfectly but there was really not much in terms of in game visuals so it's hard to describe ",1,1740820992.0,tipofmyjoystick,0,1.0,False

Elvanse / vyvanse / dexamphetamine + Prucalopride seemed to solve it

Everything was fab until I inevitably decided to come off stimulant meds , currently doing this now.. mentally I’m fine (although I am on lexapro too) , my work has changed I am not driving and I don’t need the stimulant meds as I did before 

Regardless mentally I don’t feel dependant too badly at all, however one thing really hard for me actually is the issue I just can not go toilet!!! Even WITH the Prucalopride which btw I take on empty stomach + coffee + a smoke (like this in itself should be enough but oh well) 


Has anyone got any experience in this sub?
I don’t want to be reliant on adhd meds for my bowel lol it seems so silly !!!!

TLDR: Does anyone know how I can make Prucalopride work again minus stimulant meds ?!

Perhaps timing shouldn’t be on an empty stomach?, dosage ? I’m on 2mg",2,1740820912.0,Constipation,3,1.0,False

I had painful heartburn for years through college and never thought to go to a doctor (kids). Eventually after college I mentioned to a doctor the severe level 10 pain in the middle of my chest and she prescribed me omeprazole. 
Eventually I realized a direct correlation between drinking coffee and my attacks. It took me a couple more years to fully give up coffee because I loved it so much,  but eventually I couldn’t take the pain anymore. I stopped drinking coffee and stopped the PPI and had several blessed pain free years.

A year ago I had appendicitis and my first gallbladder attack—it felt just like heartburn: acidic burning and pain so intense I can’t sit still, but it was more to my right upper quadrant vs center of chest. I finally got my gallbladder removed the end of this past January.

A couple weeks later I had the first of two extremely painful “gallbladder” attacks. Clean ct scan and blood tests (no rogue gallstones) and I was told maybe it wasn’t my gallbladder after all, but GERD. I was prescribed pantaprazole. 

It’s a few weeks later and I have a stomach bug. I’ve spent the day alternating between sitting on the toilet and vomiting bitter green bile. As such, I couldn’t take the pantaprazole in the morning as usual. Around 4pm I started having a painful RUQ attack. I finally got a pantaprazole down but not before writhing in pain for half an hour.

Now it’s 3am and I’m having a second attack, this time center of sternum. I’ve popped multiple Tums and have a hot water bottle but I’m just so miserable.

I had my gallbladder removed and went through a painful surgery recovery and my symptoms are worse and more frequent than ever. I have a stressful but high paying job and I’m desperate to find a way to lower stress if that’s what is the root of my issue but can’t figure out how to get out of the industry. 

I’m scared I will never get a handle on this GERD pain. The pain is so intense I’ve gone to the ER before, doctors just shrug.

1j0vimh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/1j0vimh/is_this_allowed/,Is this allowed?,"After reading stories on here about other pharmacies, I’ve realized the place I work at really isn’t a good place. I was a student when I started and was told a lot of the things are normal but honestly they are not. I’ve thought about complaining to higher-ups but the boss has a lot of connections. Even our HR person is his friend. (I’m in canada btw)

Here is a list of problems and please let me know if I’m wrong:

1) We were robbed twice within my few year of working there and I was never told where the panic buttons were. The lead pharmacist on that shift never pressed it. Our security cameras didn’t work and when the boss arrived, he laughed and said ‘at least nobody was killed.’


2) Pharmacy manager doesn’t wash his hands when doing injections, always has a coffee cup in the injection room right on the desk and sips it in between injections. Tbh, nobody washes their hands. The main tech who is a huge bully is always playing with her nose ring and then counts pills with her hands.

3) The staff is ALWAYS taking bad about patients. I understand some days you may have a frustrating interaction with someone and you need to vent, but they do this when the patient is at the window. Whether it be making fun of them for how they look, making transphobic jokes, etc.

4) I was told in school that counting trays were to be washed with alcohol but at my pharmacy the staff wipes it with their sleeve or blow the dust off. We are also told to always pick up pills off the ground to save money, so they blow them off if they fall on the ground.

5) A big red flag, idk how many rights you have if you are an owner of a pharmacy but the owner will come in and casually take pills out of bottles and put them in his pockets. He also takes expired narcotics like Ketamine or Testo creams because ‘they are being thrown out anyway’.",5,1740820283.0,pharmacy,3,0.86,False

I even practiced sounding like a girl before puberty came along and put it out of reach — so I thought. I'll never forget the time I learned that feminizing HRT doesn't feminize one's voice. My first thought was sympathy for all the trans ladies and transfemmes out there; my second thought was *""Damn, I could've been practicing this whole time…""* Just cis things lmao.

Practice I did, and it's been seriously paying off. I feel… *so* lucky. Voice passing honestly feels like a cheat code. Voice passing isn't necessary to be a woman or transfem, by the way, but we use the tools we have to feel most like ourselves, and my voice is the most powerful tool I have. I've only been transitioning for eight months and things are moving almost too quickly. In the past month:

* I made some new friends online that, even after I told them I was trans nonbinary, they just assumed I was AFAB, early transition. I only realized this when they apologized/corrected themselves for calling me ""she""/""sister"" etc. I guess I just exude such feminine energy 💅
* I've been on the phone a lot lately trying to get my car fixed, and every single person I've talked to so far has addressed me as ""Miss"" or ""Ms. \[Name\]"".
* I answered the phone for my landlord and she said ""Hello, is \[Name\] in?"" A couple days later, my dentist's office did the same thing: ""I'm trying to reach \[Name\]?""
* So baffling that I think my voice must've played a huge part: I met an older church lady over coffee who continuously gendered me as ""she"" — despite the coffee shop owner, who's known me for years and whom I haven't ""come out"" to yet, repeatedly calling me a ""he"" to her face lmao. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say she wasn't just being polite as she later espoused some deeply religious, conservative, and even antivaxxer positions.
* Just today, I was in a group call with some friends and one of their wives walked by on speaker so I called out ""Hello, good to see you!"" She asked her husband, ""Who was that, was that \[Kaitlyn\] or \[Ashley\]?"" (I am neither)

1j0vgx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1j0vgx5/a_meeting_with_my_younger_self/,A meeting with my younger self,"It was a drowsy day, Monday was mundane to me. I decided to call in sick, skipped breakfast and went for a long walk in the nearby garden. 
I wanted to talk, talk a lot so decided to call him, yes I called my younger self today.

He first told a straightaway no. May be fearful, may be not having enough petrol to travel or spend on coffee or probably insecure about his belly and body shape. I suggested him to take permission and recommendation from his best friend Madhav to which he agreed. And you know what, he cheerfully called me within a few minutes and agreed to meet. 

I asked him to suggest the place to which he replied sugar and spice, I told it is no more now. His face dropped down and became really really sad. I can sense the turmoil in his brain. He might have cried a little because this place was very close to him and he used to take his favourite people there for having pastries, be it his crush on Janmashtami or his best friends for his birthday. He considered it as his second home. I knew how to bring him back to senses and suggested unwind cafe nearer to Ghod dod road because I am aware that he will get confused between citylight, ghod dod and Vesu. He has not travelled much, he has not suffered much. 

And in the evening at sharp 6 pm he came, hiding his belly, hiding his pimples and walking with a broad smile. I went to the place at 5:30 only because I knew he was punctual. He was present at the location at 5:45 pm only as usual and kept waiting downstairs. 

He wore his favourite blue shirt and grey pants, he thought it would help him hide his extra belly fat. Alas! he was wrong, he was really fat but he was honest. He was comparatively happy without any heartbreaks. I gave him the menu card, he loved being a centre of attraction those days. He ordered chocolate brownies with ice cream and gleamed with utter joy. Ordered two and asked me politely. I ordered two slices of pizza. Our favourite till date. Because We+Pizza = together forever. He was skeptical thinking about his body fat but I assured him.  Also, little did he know that those brownies were the main culprit for his weight gain. He was not aware about the concept of sugar cravings, about low carb high protein diet, about the intentions of the people dear to him, about his parents’ financial situation and their hardships, about the heartache he will have, about the heart stroke he will have, about the multiple dengue attacks he will have, about the toe surgeries he will have, about his best friends secret engagement or his younger brother’s marriage. He was there sitting unwavered, unharmed; awaiting his brownies, awaiting his life.

He tried to initiate the conversation and kept looking at my apple gadgets, for him this was his dream. He thought that apple products were made for cream people and not for us. He went through my clothes and shoes. He was amazed by the brands. Still he noticed my dull eyes behind my contact lenses, and scanned my white hair through the broad head. He asked me about our mother and I said she is all okay. I asked what she was making today. He uttered chicken curry, roti and meatballs. My favourite till date but I don’t eat them anymore. I have now turned vegetarian, I have turned barbarian with my own family.

He kept talking about the pressure of his exams, his father’s attitude and his mother’s sacrifices. He asked me about the future. I gave him some positives; the doable salary package, the job in hometown which he wanted, the posh house, loving parents, singlehood and a cute little nephew. He blushed and asked about our marriage, I commented no with an assuring smile and said it will be in our best interest. 

I talked about us being a Chemistry teacher, his weakest subject. Talked about being best friends with wonderful people at multiple job roles. Talked about office politics and heartbreakers, exciting solo trips and sleepless, teary nights. He was shrewd yet sensitive, wasn’t able to digest more and told me to stop. His eyes were wet, his body shaken, he pulled down his shirt and pulled up his pants, he wiped his face with the small hand rolled napkin and took his slingbag to storm out. He literally ran and never looked back. I was sure that he would call his best friend and our mother was there to hold him. I know he will sleep contented and realize it was a dream, he will also skip his meals for a day and again engage with his daily routine, expecting a miracle to happen, expecting to marry with his crush, expecting his best friend to be his side forever, expecting to earn much for his parents and family. 

I wished him the deepest regards and cried with the sharpest guards.

It's fuc*ing wild and ironic because I consider myself a hopeless romantic, leaning more towards the hopeless side. However, it has been nothing short of damaging for my self-esteem to face my destructive patterns that kept me from truly meeting myself as deeply as I have wanted to. 

Over a cup of coffee, I sat down to contemplate and think back to my childhood self, who sought comfort and security in romance. Was it the idea of romance that appealed to me? Perhaps, not the brutal reality I witnessed in my household? Or am I conflicted cause I don't understand the idea of being trapped with one person forever, chained to them, bound by the society's judgement, scrutinization, no matter how bad things get? 

I happened to witness something along the same lines growing up, and unknowingly ended up associating relationships with abuse, toxicity, controlling tendencies and what not. It has been difficult to face myself and more so, confront myself about the same. In retrospect, turns out, I have become someone I used to dislike deeply. How is it possible for a hopeless romantic to be commitment phobic at the same time? It doesn't add up. 

But hold on, there's more. I'm not scared of falling in love, I'm scared of getting my heart broken. I don't get cold feet cause I want to explore my options and keep them open, I am very loyal, that's ruled out too. The only conclusion is that I have severely lacked healthy relationships growing up, and all the toxicity I experienced instilled a deep rooted fear in my mind. The fear of finding myself in an abusive abusive relationship after doing everything possible in my power to heal, and get better. The fear of re-living childhood trauma. 

I did have a dramatic cry about it, but I'm all good now. Accepting the parts of myself that seem unacceptable will make room for transformation. 
So yeah, I'm a hopeless romantic and someone who is commitment phobic, all at once. I guess, I have been blessed with the best of both world's by the Aphrodite herself 🥲

Tim’s phone buzzed against his nightstand. He reached for it instinctively, still groggy from sleep. One notification. Sarah.

Sarah: “Coffee. Now. Extra caramel. Chop chop 👣💖”

No greeting. No pleasantries. Just an order, like always.

Tim swallowed hard. His mind had barely woken up, yet his body was already moving.

He threw on yesterday’s jeans, ran a hand through his hair, and grabbed his wallet. There was no thought, no hesitation—just obedience.

The Books on the Floor

Sarah’s sorority house was quiet this early in the morning, but her room was already glowing with soft pink light from her LED strips. The air smelled exactly like her—warm vanilla, jasmine, and a hint of fresh citrus lotion.

Her door was open. It always was when she was expecting him.

Tim stepped inside, careful not to make too much noise. Sarah was curled up on her pink velvet couch, scrolling her phone, one perfectly bare leg draped over the other.

She didn’t look up. She didn’t greet him.

She didn’t need to.

Tim started toward her when something on the floor caught his eye.

Books. A laptop. A half-finished homework assignment. His books. His work.

Tim blinked in confusion.

Before he could speak, Sarah finally looked up. Her bright green eyes locked onto him, her lips curving into an innocently cruel smile.

“Oh, those?” she asked sweetly, tilting her head. “They’re for you, duh.”

Tim hesitated. “You… want me to do your homework?”

Sarah giggled, stretching her arms above her head. The hem of her tiny pink tank top lifted just slightly, exposing the smooth curve of her toned stomach. She moved like someone who had never once in her life questioned whether she could get exactly what she wanted.

“You’re so cute,” she said, voice dripping with amusement. “Like, you actually thought I was gonna do that myself?”

Tim swallowed. His knees met the floor before he even processed it.

Sarah reached for the coffee in his hand, her fingers brushing his as she took it. She took a slow sip, letting out a satisfied little hum before sinking deeper into the couch.

Tim exhaled, relieved.

Then she stopped drinking.

Wrinkled her nose.

And before Tim could react, she spat a mouthful of caramel-sweetened coffee right back into the cup.

“Ew,” she groaned, shoving it back toward him like it personally offended her. “Too much caramel. Fix it.”

Tim froze.

The warmth of the cup burned against his fingers. He could see the pale swirl of her spit floating on the surface.

He didn’t move.

Didn’t know why he didn’t move.

Sarah’s eyes flicked up.

Then, softer, sweeter—too sweet: “Are you actually hesitating?”

Tim’s mouth opened slightly, but he couldn’t speak.

Sarah sighed, tilting her head, watching him carefully.

Then—she stretched her legs out lazily, luxuriously. Her perfect, bare foot lifted, pressing against his thigh just slightly, as if she was testing his reaction.

Tim didn’t move away.

Her toes flexed, dragging slowly across his jeans before curling beneath his chin.

Lifting his face.

Tilting it up.

“Ohhh, Timmy,” she cooed, her voice honeyed and dangerous. “Are you embarrassed?”

Tim’s throat felt dry.

Sarah’s foot moved gently, dragging along the line of his jaw.

“That’s actually so precious,” she giggled. “You think anyone cares what you do?”

Tim broke.

His fingers trembled as he lifted the cup.

Sarah watched him the entire time.

He swallowed the mixture down. Warm oat milk. Sweet caramel. And the faint, unmistakable tang of her spit.

Sarah’s face lit up.

“Aww,” she beamed, pressing her sole against his cheek. “You’re actually such a good little helper.”

Tim’s breath shuddered out of him.

Sarah wiggled her toes playfully. “You’re welcome, by the way.”

Tim swallowed hard. “T-Thank you, Sarah.”

She raised an eyebrow. “For what?”

Tim knew the answer. Knew what she wanted to hear.

“…Thank you for letting me fix your coffee.”

Sarah stretched luxuriously, flexing her perfect arches in front of his face. “Good boy.”

Then, just like that, she turned back to her phone.

Her feet rested on his thigh now, completely unacknowledged. As if he were just a convenient footrest.

Tim sat frozen for a moment. Then, slowly, he reached for the books on the floor.

Sarah sighed. “Okayyyy,” she murmured. “Time for you to get to work.”

And just like that, Tim was dismissed.

Tim Becomes Furniture

Tim had only been working for about ten minutes when he felt it.

The weight.

Sarah had shifted without a word.

She stretched her long legs out on the couch, her bare feet pressing down on his back.

She never asked.

Never even acknowledged it.

It just happened.

Tim was already on the floor, already working. So, why wouldn’t she use him?

Sarah sighed, wiggling her toes absently against his shirt.

“Mmm, much better,” she murmured.

She wasn’t talking to him.

She wasn’t even looking at him.

Tim stared down at the calculus problem, his hands shaking as he tried to focus.

Sarah stretched, flexing her soles against his spine like he was a cushion.

Then—her phone rang.

Sarah brightened instantly.

“Oh my god, hey babe!” she chirped.

Tim’s stomach twisted.

She ignored him completely, her toes absently rubbing against his shoulder as she chatted.

Tim’s hands clenched against his pencil.

He tried to focus. Tried to pretend this was normal.

But then—he heard it.

Sarah’s giggle. Light. Careless.

“Oh my god, no, he’s literally obsessed with my feet,” she laughed. “Like, it’s actually pathetic.”

Tim’s body locked.

His mind snapped to attention.

Sarah’s friend giggled through the phone. “Wait—seriously? He’s right there?”

Sarah smirked.

“Oh, totally. Under me.”

Tim’s lungs locked.

Then—the words that changed everything.

“I mean, obviously. He’s not even a real man.”

Tim’s heart stopped.

Sarah kept talking.

Kept laughing.

Kept casually erasing him.

And Tim just… listened.

“Not a Real Man”

Tim’s pencil froze mid-equation.

His fingers trembled slightly against the paper, his mind replaying the words he wished he had misheard.

“I mean, obviously. He’s not even a real man.”

Sarah’s voice. Light. Careless. Like she was stating the weather.

Soft laughter. The sweet, silvery kind she always had when she found something adorable. Except this time, she was laughing at him.

Tim’s heart slammed against his ribs.

His breath went shallow, a tightness forming in his throat that he couldn’t swallow down.

But he didn’t move.

Didn’t react.

Couldn’t.

Sarah’s conversation with her friend continued above him, over him, through him— like he wasn’t even there.

Like his feelings, his presence, his existence were simply irrelevant.

Her feet were still pressed against his back, warm and completely at ease, flexing slightly every time she shifted her position.

She hadn’t even said it to him.

She had said it about him.

Like a passing thought. Like a fact.

Tim’s mind screamed at him to do something. Object. Push back. Tell her she was wrong.

But instead, he just knelt there.

The Protest That Never Had a Chance

The soft click of Sarah’s phone signaled the end of the call.

She sighed, stretching her arms above her head, letting out a small, satisfied hum.

Her feet pressed down a little harder against his back before shifting, adjusting, completely unbothered.

Tim’s hands clenched into fists against his lap.

The words echoed inside his skull, bouncing between his ribs, lodging deep into his stomach like a stone.

His mouth felt dry.

It took him a full ten seconds before he finally worked up the courage to speak.

“…I’m not a real man?”

It wasn’t a question. Not really.

Sarah blinked, then turned her attention to him as if noticing him for the first time.

And then—she smiled.

A slow, sweet, amused smile.

“Ohhh,” she purred, tucking her blonde hair behind her ear. “You actually heard that?”

Tim swallowed.

She tilted her head, her expression soft and mockingly patient, as if she were speaking to a confused child.

“You’re not actually upset about that, are you?”

Tim felt his face burn.

“I just—” He exhaled sharply. “You don’t actually think that.”

Sarah’s eyes sparkled.

“Oh, Timmy,” she sighed, pressing her toes gently against his shoulder, absently rubbing her arch over his shirt.

“You’re so precious when you try to pretend.”

Tim’s breath shook.

Sarah leaned forward slightly, resting her elbows on her knees, studying him with an expression of pure, indulgent amusement.

“Okay,” she cooed. “Let’s think about it.”

She stretched one long, bare leg out in front of her, pointing her toes.

“Would a real man be on the floor right now, doing my homework?”

Tim’s lungs locked.

Sarah tilted her head, giving him time to answer.

He didn’t.

Her smile widened.

“Would a real man have drunk my spit this morning?”

Tim felt heat crawl up his neck.

His mouth opened slightly, but—no words came out.

Sarah giggled.

“Would a real man let a girl use him as a footrest without even thinking about it?”

Silence.

Tim’s stomach twisted.

Sarah let out a small, mocking little sigh, like she was so patient with him.

“Ohhh, Timmy,” she whispered. “You can’t even answer, can you?”

Tim’s fingers curled into the fabric of his jeans.

His chest felt tight, heavy.

Sarah watched him carefully, seeing the exact moment when the truth settled into his bones.

She stretched lazily, giggling.

“But it’s okay,” she hummed. “You don’t have to admit it out loud.”

She shifted slightly, lifting her foot from his shoulder to his cheek.

“I know the truth. You know the truth.”

Her toes curled slightly.

“We all do.”

Tim’s jaw tightened.

Sarah gave a soft, mocking pout.

“Awww, don’t be grumpy, Timmy. I’ll even give you a little test.”

She stretched out her foot again, brushing her toes against his lips.

“If you’re a real man, just say it.”

Her voice was sweet, casual—like she wasn’t even thinking about it.

“Say, ‘I’m a real man,’ and I’ll believe you.”

Tim’s pulse roared in his ears.

His lips parted slightly.

The words should have been so easy.

So obvious.

I’m a real man.

I’m a real man.

…but they wouldn’t come.

Sarah waited.

The moment stretched.

Tim’s breath shuddered.

Sarah tilted her head, smiling.

“Ohhh, Timmy,” she giggled softly, brushing her foot gently against his lips.

“You can’t even say it, can you?”

The dam broke.

Tim’s lips trembled.

His head dropped.

And then, barely above a whisper—

“…I’m not a real man.”

Silence.

Sarah didn’t react at first.

She just watched him.

Her lips curved slowly, lazily, delightedly.

And then—softly, gently—

“Good boy.”

She lifted her bare foot, pressing it against his lips.

Tim’s pulse hammered.

“Again.”

A beat.

A hesitation.

Then—Tim obeyed.

“…I’m not a real man.”

Sarah’s toes curled slightly.

“Awww, good boy. Now, kiss.”

Tim’s lips pressed against her sole.

Sarah exhaled in sweet satisfaction.

“Again.”

Tim hesitated—only for a second.

“…I’m not a real man.”

Another kiss.

Sarah smirked.

Again.

Again.

She made him repeat it over and over, until he stopped thinking about it, until it came out naturally, like breathing.

Until it wasn’t a command anymore.

Just an automatic response.

Sarah giggled, watching his mind unravel.

Tim’s eyes were unfocused now, his lips moving before he even realized it.

“I’m not a real man.”

Kiss.

“I’m not a real man.”

Kiss.

His body moved on autopilot.

Sarah sighed happily, stretching her arms behind her head.

Then—a soft click.

Tim barely noticed.

Sarah’s phone screen flickered slightly as she tapped something.

She smiled.

Bright. Sweet. Mocking.

“Perfect,” she whispered.

Her voice was soft. Pleased.

She tilted her head, watching him with warm amusement.

“Now we have a memory.”

Tim froze.

Sarah’s phone was still in her hands.

The screen still recording.

Two months out of a relationship, I (F24) decided to have coffee with someone (M23). We spent an hour together, super casual. Talked about our dream cars, biking, work, books. The conversation just flowed. 

However, I had a mental breakdown for two days straight after this meeting and I realised that I am obviously not yet ready to see anyone else and that there is a lot of healing to be done.

I haven’t messaged this person again, and neither has he. He still views my stories on instagram and I get the impression that he might be waiting for me to make the next move.

I have been out of the dating scene for a while so I don’t know what the protocol is. But how do I let them know that I am not ready to pursue anything but I had a nice time? Or has that ship sailed? I don’t want to just leave things because that would count as semi-ghosting? What needs to be done?

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Stynek, Jolly Venlil Child***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 25th, 2136*

My eyes fluttered open and my ears were immediately up and alert. It was morning. I quickly raised my head. The door was still slightly ajar as I left it. In my excitement to check whether Noah’s promises were true, I quickly got out of my bed, nearly falling over in the rush, and ran to the playroom.

The tree was still there, pretty and decorated, but underneath it there was now a whole pile of varied colorful boxes! All of them had big bows on top and small labels attached. I looked around, and found Tallin laying beside the pile on his side. Must have fallen asleep on the watch, just like me. I gently pushed him aside, allowing him to keep resting and focused my attention on the gifts.

I peeked at the label on one of the boxes on top. It said ‘*From: Kiara*’. I looked at another. ‘*From: Noah*’. They were all labeled like that.

I dug deeper into the pile, looking further and checking names on all of them, looking for a specific one. And it was there!

I gasped as I pulled out a smaller box, with the sender being labelled as ‘From: Santa’. I pulled it out from the pile and stood aside, examining it. There was no clear indication on what the contents were, so I simply tore at the wrapping with my claws, opening up the gift.

Under the wrapping there was a cardboard box, and inside that there was a smaller aluminum box with a transparent top. Inside I could see some sort of a small electronic device carefully embedded. As I looked over the small box, I could find no way to open it. Instead, I noticed the letter in the box it came in, and took it out.

‘*Dear Stynek,*

*Merry Christmas! I know you haven’t written me a letter because  your guardians forgot to tell you, but you were still a very nice girl this year and you deserve this little gift. It’s a translator implant! Compatible with venlil. Ask your guardians and they’ll know what to do about it, but don’t open the box by yourself!*

*Yours, Santa Claus.*’

I switched to take a look at the contents of the box. Then back at the letter. Wasn’t the science team talking about progress on their self-made implants right before the gojid arrived? I was pretty sure Andes mentioned it in one of his rants.

Did that mean the letter wasn’t really from Santa, but from someone else, as was the gift?

I quickly checked the other boxes, but found the names of all the humans I could call familiar present, as well as several that I didn’t recall. That meant that nobody specific pretended to be Santa. But still… That implant. The humans were talking about how they were planning to give me one at some point. And now here it was, right as they were making progress to finish one.

I then decided to dig a little deeper. I took the ‘From: Santa’ label and went to look for Noah’s gift and compared the labels.

I knew it! The handwriting looked the same! Even the letter felt eerily familiar to me! That was probably because I’ve seen Noah write during a lot of our earlier lessons in language… It was the same! Noah wrote the label and the letter both!

So Santa wasn’t real. I felt my cheek warm up as my tail wagged with pride. I was right, Noah was just messing with me in the end. Even tried to trick me with the gift!

But still… With that implant, I wouldn’t need a drone following me around constantly to talk to humans. I would just be able to understand anyone, anywhere, and if the humans had one for me, they must already have ones of themselves too! That meant other people would be able to understand me too!

My ears twitched as I gave the implant box a quick hug, before returning it to the bigger box. Santa may not be real, but I didn’t need a magic gift-bringing human. Far as I was concerned, all humans were magic gift bringers! They were all Santa, really. Maybe that’s where the fairy tale came from?

I shook my head, ignoring the thought of magical humans and focused on the gifts again. I pulled Noah’s aside, deciding to save whatever he gave me from his own name for last, and started with other ones that were familiar.

First one that I grabbed was Kiara’s. Her box wasn’t too large, but as I opened it, I couldn’t stuff the contents back inside. It was a huge soft pillow almost as big as me, yet soft enough to be compacted into the box. After failing to contain it inside the box myself, I dragged the whole thing out and tossed it onto my actual bed before returning to the box and reading the note.

‘*We noticed you tend to roll up your blanket in your sleep and cuddle up to it, so I thought you would enjoy something actually intended for cuddling. Enjoy!*’

Cuddle pillow… That made sense. I decided I would try it tonight!

Next one was from Andes. It was much smaller, about the same size as the implant case. Except his had a small holopad! I booted it up, and it was clearly very restricted, only opening up a book reader application, with the interface all being in human. And currently, it only had two books. ‘Introductory Etymology Course’ and ‘The Magical World of Linguistics’. That second one made my ears go flat with how childish it looked. Ha-ha, very funny Andes, I was neither a child that young, nor needed extracurriculars to learn human speech. Anymore.

A small note in the box also said that there is an option to type in your own notes and an offer to come over with the pad if I wanted to ‘expand functionale’ whatever that meant. I decided to clarify another time, and moved on to the next gift.

Sara left a gift too, apparently. Inside was a very pretty-looking wooden brush for my wool, with a carving of some flowers on the back. There was no note attached other than the signature, but I decided that this brush looked much better than my current plastic one, so I kept it.

Erin left a gift too, though hers was very simple. A sketchbook with a UN logo at the front. The pages in it were notably larger than my usual sketchbooks though, so I could draw bigger things.

There were a few more gifts from more vaguely familiar names. Elias, the human leader, gifted me a small bag to throw over shoulder. That’d be useful to carry things around if I didn’t have my drone to carry things in after I got the implant. There was also a pretty bracelet from the woman who always wore dark glasses and a suit, a small music player from one of the guards, a set of special markers designed to easily draw on and wash off my leg from one of the prosthetic engineers…

The more obscure the names got, the more generic the gift was. There were toys, small accessories, even a few fruits. But eventually, I ran out of those gifts and moved onto the big one. Figuratively, as it was only moderately sized, but it was big in my heart. Noah’s gift.

The box was moderate in size, and unlike others, I took care in unwrapping it, untying the ribbon on top and removing it, before carefully undoing the wrapping paper, only tearing it a little bit in the process.

Within the box under the paper was… a book. But the title of it wasn’t written in human, it was in venlil! It said ‘Memories’. I opened it and…

It was a photo album. Not a digital one, but a physical! I’ve never seen one before! And the pictures, they all had me in them! Except they were mixed… There were a lot of pictures from earlier in my life, with me and my mom and sometimes also dad at public events back home. And interspersed with them were pictures of me here, in the Theseus. Mostly with Noah, but occasionally various other staff could be glimpsed in either background and foreground. From pictures of me carefully hiding behind Noah’s legs during my first exploration of the facility, to me snacking on a nice delicious pear, to me running through the hallways, testing the maximum speed of my drone…

I kept flipping, seeing memories both old and new all over. It was the perfect album. As I flipped towards the end, the pages became all empty. I flipped back to the last page that had a picture… And it was a picture of myself sitting in Noah’s lap from yesterday. And right on that page, there was a note from Noah. Same handwriting as ‘Santa’. I unfolded it and read the contents.

‘*Dear Stynek,*

*Merry Christmas, honey. I wanted to give you a gift that you could potentially keep with you even after you eventually go home. So, I decided to make this. It took some digging in Federation’s internet to find the photos of you from back then, as there weren’t too many, but I hope you’ll enjoy them anyway. That way you can remember your home while here and remember here when you’re home.*

*With love,*

*Noah.*’

I closed the album and hugged it tightly to my chest. I would definitely make sure to find a way to take it home with me. Hopefully when that happens, the wider world would know humans are good and it won’t be an issue.

I couldn’t help but wonder though… I knew mom and dad went separate ways. If they were now separate and Noah wouldn’t be able to go, would I need to go to three different places to visit them all regularly? That sounded long and complicated. Maybe mom and dad might reunite after I’m back? If humans allowed mom and Aunt Piri to talk about everything to the Federation, then they might be able to let dad know too.

But if mom and dad get back together, then how does Noah fit in? Could I bring him with me too? Would mom and dad be okay with it?

Families are complicated.

“*Merry Christmas, Stynek. I see you’ve already opened all the gifts here.*” A voice spoke behind me. Noah!

I turned around and rushed him, making him flinch as I bumped into him with arms spread wide for a hug.

“*Good morning, Noah! Thank you! This is goodest gift!*” I beeped happily.

“*It’s ‘best’.*” He corrected me. I knew that, but I slipped up on occasion anyway. Exceptions were lame. “*And it’s Christmas, so whenever you see someone, you say ‘Merry Christmas’ instead of the usual ‘hello’, okay?*”

“*Okay!*” I pulled away and looked up at him, my tail wagging extra fast. “*Merry Christmas, Noah!*” I waved my hand up at him.

He let out a laugh and scooped me up into his arms, allowing me to sit on them. I quickly settled into the usual position and rested my head on his shoulder.

“*What will we do today?*” I asked him.

“*Well, for starters…*” He began, pulling away the album from my hand carefully and putting it down on a table. “…let’s go and eat some leftovers from yesterday for breakfast. You probably got a lot of exercise opening all those gifts.”

“*No! I could do it all day!*” I swished my tail and looked at him happily.

“*You might just have to. Those were just the gifts from the facility staff and Secretary-General.*” Noah smiled before realizing something and adding something. “*And Santa.*”

“*And Santa.*” I echoed after him with a cheeky tone.

“*But, we decided that since we’re allowing this, we might as well allow you to receive a curated portion from gifts from around the world people keep sending you.*” His smile turned into a devious smirk.

“Wait…” I spoke, as the realization dawned on me. I knew I was super popular with humans because of my recordings and such… And super important because I was an Important Child… but… “How many…?”

“*Well, the batch you’re going to be given access to will be filling the room size of your playroom. I imagine a lot of it is accessories, toys and other miscellanea. They sorted away anything you might not be able to use or that was deemed problematic. I don’t know why the president of Brazil would send you an adult-sized guitar, or what the hell the British royals were thinking with an offer of ‘honorary knighthood’, political implications and all, but the stuff in the room won’t be that. Only stuff you can actually enjoy.*” He explained as he carried me down the hallway.

“*Room… Full of gifts…*” I mumbled, stuck on the first sentence, unable to process the rest.

Noah just let out a chuckle at that.

“*And that’s why you’ll need to eat well in the morning. You liked the food yesterday, right?*” He asked.

“*It was delicious!*” I agreed, trying not to think about a room full of gifts.

“*Then let’s go. And after I’ll show you to the place where we got the approved gifts stored.*”

I didn’t reply and looked ahead towards the breakroom he was bringing me to. My tail’s wags intensified, thwapping against Noah’s chest.

I decided that I liked Christmas. We should do it back home too!

***

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Dr. Erin Kuemper, UN Secretary of Alien Affairs***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 28th, 2136*

I let out an audible groan as I settled into my chair. I couldn’t keep standing anymore, the weight of the bags under my eyes would just make me fall over. I wasn’t sure if Jones had a few identical twins, if she was a robot running on coffee and spite, or if she actually sleepwalked with her eyes closed behind those sunglasses, but a normal human being was not built for this level of constant activity.

Non-stop intelligence briefings about Federation’s reaction to the ‘gaians’ and their existence have become my nightmare, or would have if I had gotten enough sleep to experience any dreams at all. We’ve been sorting through lists of potential contacts and connection points without pause, constantly changing priorities and analyzing finer points, and I had to be in on it all because I was still the second-final say before the Secretary-General.

What was the worst was that even now that I could catch a break from it, I was greeted with a separate stack of papers on my desk. I looked through some of the folders at the top.

Dr. Bahri was proposing to allow human therapists in gaian suits to interact directly with the Moon gojid rescues. I personally wasn’t opposed, but safety procedures could use a review by Jones and it’d need approval from Elias too.

One Marcel Fraser was requesting further clarifications on the start dates of the planned Arxur Exchange Program… It was like he and Coth were synchronized in driving me up the wall. The planning was put on the backburner for a reason, we had no time to organize an exchange program while the rescues were still ongoing. I knew it didn’t stop some sort of ‘underground’ exchange from forming, with efforts from Fraser and Coth, but Jones knew and wasn’t acting so I didn’t care. They could keep doing that until we had time and resources to focus on it.

Then there were amendments to the Titan Shipyard project and its contingencies to involve the Moon gojid, waiting for approval… Zhao already put down his signature, as did Elias, which left only me. I decided to start with reviewing it, as it seemed like the least complicated thing to address right now.

Only to get interrupted by a knock. I had to count to five before speaking up.

“Come in!”

And in walks none other than Sara Rosario. My hand went to my forehead before I even knew it, as I could already tell what the conversation would be about.

“I know I’ve been annoying about it, but I promise, I’m not here to argue or make demands, I just wanted a clarification about Stynek.” She spoke calmly.

“Alright. What is it?” I asked, still clutching my forehead as I looked back at her.

“Date. Listen, I am not demanding any specific date, but the plan so far was to have her returned ‘after the first rescue exchange was done’. Well, it’s in process right now, with the gojid extracting their rescues as we speak. All I wanted to know is, what's the next step in getting Stynek home?”

Something snapped. Maybe it was lack of sleep, maybe it was lack of patience or maybe it was specifically Sara’s constant repeats of same questions and requests, but I couldn’t handle it anymore.

“There is no next step!” I snapped at Sara, making the woman flinch. “How many times do I have to tell you?! She’ll go home when we deem it safe for her to go home, for both her and us! Maybe it’ll be tomorrow, maybe it’ll be never! I don’t know, and it doesn’t matter! She’s happy, she’s content, she’s got occasional communications with her mother through second hand means, what else do you want?!”

“I just… The plan is still to return her… So I wanted to know…” Her voice was very hesitant. She was playing the victim now after driving me to this point.

“Maybe it’s not anymore!” I spat out angrily. “What’s it to you? You asked to be removed from interactions with Stynek, I granted it, the way I see it, it improved both of your situations. That’s it. End of story. What happens next is none of your business. We’ll keep her safe, and you can keep working on figuring out the alien biological quirks. No more conflict!”

I glared right at Sara. She just stared back at me with wide eyes. Part of me expected her to cry as I suddenly realized I might have gone a bit too far, but she just gulped down and nodded.

“Right. You are right of course… I’ll… I’ll be going now… Sorry for the bother, Erin.” Sara hurried out of my office.

I didn’t try to stop her. Any apology I said now would be meaningless, and with how bitter I was right now, it wouldn’t sound genuine anyway. I’d just have to track her down later and explain myself.

I looked at the document in front of me, skimmed to the last page and put the signature down. The whole project on Titan was Zhao’s, and after the success of Outis, I trusted him enough.

That was when someone else walked in, this time without knocking. I didn’t even need to look up to recognize that stride.

“Good morning, General.” I greeted her, pretending like I was busy reading Zhao’s proposal.

“I didn’t expect you to throw yourself right back into work like that, Dr. Kuemper.” She commented. “We’ve pulled a few all-nighters with the Federation’s response to the revelation. Are you not eager to get some sleep?”

I hid my eye twitching in annoyance by raising the document up enough to obscure my face.

“If I want to ever have a reasonable sleep schedule, I should start fixing it by going to sleep in the evening, not early morning.” I refuted. “Was there something you needed? I was told that the intelligence won’t need my input for a bit unless something huge happens.”

“Something did happen, though it’s neither huge nor is it related to the Federation’s response.” She explained. “It’s the arxur.”

I blinked, taking a moment to process her words, before lowering Zhao’s proposal and looking at the woman in front of me. She was not in a joking mood.

“What’s wrong there? Did Isif make contact or is it just Coth wanting to ask about the Exchange Program again?” I asked.

“Neither. While, in his boundless desire to not upset our allies, Elias did forbid me from going too far in my… ‘observations’ of the arxur, I did receive some worrying news.” She adjusted her sunglasses. “Prophet-Descendant Giznel has announced a gathering of all of Dominion’s Chief Hunters on Wriss in a week.”

“And how does this affect us directly?” I furrowed my brows, mind a bit sluggish, as I went about processing the news. “Wait… That never happens normally, does it? The arxur hate social gatherings, their whole approach to them is just particularly rude and verbally visceral forms of ‘this could have been an email’.”

“Correct. And we do know the arxur keep an eye on the Federation news cycle.” Jones added.

The pieces clicked and felt like a jolt ran through me as I realized what it meant.

“They’re going to be discussing how the cattle rescue happened. And Isif will have to either take the responsibility, or reveal us.” I thought out loud. “Is that why you’re coming to me first?”

“Moreso because you are the closest of the people that would need to know this.” Jones crossed her arms. “As it is likely you that will be making communications with the rest of the Dominion once we are revealed to them.”

“They’re going to open contact with us. And I am responsible for it…” I groaned. “Alright… That’s fine, I can handle a few more arxur. I know we lucked out with Isif, knowing what we know now, but it’s clear that promises of prosperity are working on his sector, even the non-defectives…”

“I’ll be reporting this to Elias soon. But I thought I’d give you extra time to prepare.” Jones smirked.

“Right… They’ll probably want a meeting too… I think we could use the station in Outis’ orbit for that, actually. I’ll have to be there by the time the meeting happens, just in case.” I mumbled, mentally rearranging my schedule. “With the current timetable, all the gojid will be gone by then, and I need to give the place another inspection for how it looks in the aftermath of the rescue anyway…”

“Seems like you’ve got your plans formed already, Dr. Kuemper.” Jones nodded. “I’ll leave you to it.”

With that she left. And only after she was gone, did I realize that this was basically her gloating over the fact that I won’t be getting any rest any time soon. It was shaping up like once the gojid rescues were done and the Federation reactions had been compiled we’d be able to take things slow and make more careful, long-term plans, but things were never that simple…

I thought back to my last communications with the arxur. Both were with Coth, one on 23rd, when he reported having finished all the gojid drop-offs and departure of all arxur vessels, and another yesterday, when he wished to ask about the Exchange Program progress. And despite how talkative he can get once he starts speaking, he never mentioned anything about Isif having to depart. That was definitely a fresh development.

My mind drifted to what we knew of the Prophet-Descendant. An arxur who wields the absolute power in the Dominion and who is basically the main authority on the Betterment. When we first started interacting with the arxur, Isif claimed he was keeping humanity a secret from the rest of the Dominion, under a total information lockdown, all for purposes of creating an advantageous position for himself. Since the breakthrough in the negotiations, he added extra context – he suspected that the Betterment will not like what we are trying to do, and was worried about a negative reaction.

That was definitely worrisome, but not too much. Isif’s sector was thriving with abundance of food, and from what I heard from Coth, a lot of arxur were unironically finding themselves at a loss with excess energy and lack of things to do. The defectives started spreading the idea of art and self-expression. Some of the farms were entirely shut down, the feed-growing land now operated by much more efficient automated machinery. Perhaps Betterment’s current ways meant something in a world where hunting and killing for meat was the only option, and where abandoning all morality and empathy towards your victims was the only way to survive, both as individuals and as a species. But with our help, the cycle could be broken. We could usher in a new arxur golden age, and allow them to restore the culture lost during the devastation of the great famine.

The famine… That was something I had forgotten about entirely, and something that was pushed to the side as we got involved with more immediately pressing concerns. Arxur history states that the Federation delivered mass poison that made the arxur unable to consume meat, and that made cattle animals die. Federation history mentions none of that and just states that the arxur attacked unexpectedly. Looking at what little Dominion history survived, it appeared that Northwest Bloc was the proto-Dominion and came to power primarily because of said events, and would not have otherwise, meaning they did happen. But Federation ran with the unscientific anti-predator rhetoric for centuries before discovering the arxur. If they wanted to destroy them, why didn’t they just… do it? If they wanted to befriend them, why poison? And in either case, why touch the cattle?

Something didn’t match up and it left a nagging feeling, like my wary optimism about the rest of Dominion finding out about humans was misguided. It was a hunch, a gut feeling at most… But it was there.

I shook my head and turned my attention to the stack of papers again. Dwelling on what might have been and what might be is only good when you don’t have anything right in front of you, and I had plenty. Such as this wonderful list of proposals for alternate suppliers of food for Moon gojid… We used a smaller supplier since we weren’t sending the food in nearly as much bulk, and for a lot less necessary shelf time, but it resulted in contamination and a breakout of mass allergic reaction, thankfully very mild due to low contamination level. I knew the Federation believed meat was poison for herbivores, but I didn’t know it had actual, real scientific basis. Though the xenobiologists were now chomping at trying to figure out why the gojid reacted that way, after Stynek reacted to meat in a much more ‘expected’ herbivore manner.

I gave Kiara’s proposal for allowing human doctors to visit those gojid another thought. I’d definitely need to include an extra approval list for it rather than permitting all current staff. Some of them would be way too eager and hands-on…

With my mind back in the work-oriented direction, I opened the list of proposed food suppliers and started looking further into them. Apparently it was up to me to make sure their dry cereal facilities didn’t also make cricket crunchies…

Anyways, I managed to doze off again but got woken up 45 minutes later. It is now 2:42 as I type this and I can't get back to sleep. After his friend left, he tried to turn on a movie, and lay in bed. I flipped out and because he wanted the pillow I bought for him, but was currently using, I chucked it across the room., over the futon, chipping one of his mother's new coffee mugs. Shortly after that, he said I could just leave if Im truly that unhappy. But I am happy. I'm just really irritated.

Idly - Wasn’t soft enough, found it to be a little bit sour, I guess the batter was not as fresh as it should be. 6/10 
Upma - It was tasty and the texture was also good. Went very well with the chutneys. 8.5/10 
Masala Dosae - Texture was good. Lacked a bit of crisp and the aloo stuffing inside was mixed with some sauce which made it lose its authenticity. 7/10 
Filter Coffee - It was perfect, down to the last minute detail! A solid 10/10. 
Chutneys were mid at best. 7/10 
Sambar disappointed me the most. Sour and tangy. Had no flavours hitting the spot tbh. 4/10 
Overall it was a good experience ngl. Ik it’s hard to find proper South Indian food here just like how it’s hard to find authentic Bengali dishes like Kolkata style biryani, Chingri Malai curry, Mutton Kosha etc in Bengaluru. So I’m still happy that I tried it out, thank you all for introducing me to the place :D

It was a little over a year ago. I knew it was a fake name but I just went with it. One of my best friends brought her along to a party. We talked for a while, I vibed with her a lot. She was really strange but not in an antisocial way. She said whatever she wanted and clearly wasn’t the type to take anyones shit. She was really pretty too.

I kept seeing her at stuff. It felt like suddenly we had a million mutual friends. Sometimes we talked when I saw her at parties or concerts, sometimes I didn’t but we always stopped to at least say Hi and I was always happy to see you.

Then I hit a rough patch. Life just started throwing everything it could at me and i was overwhelmed, exhausted, and frustrated.

She would always check in. we ran into eachother at a coffee shop on a day I was in a bad mood, I tried to hide it but clearly it didn’t work cuz she texted me to check in afterward

Suddenly she always had an extra ticket to a play or would text me about a bonfire or wanted to sneak into a movie. We got into a car crash together(our faults) and spent four uninterrupted hours waiting for the tow. After that she always sat next to me at parties. I felt closer to her than people I had known for half a decade.

I learned more and more about her. She was so bold and impulsive but would get insecure about the strangest things. She always had access to a back up pair of clothes in case she stained what she was wearing. She was the life of the party at every party but would suddenly get so shy and retreat. She loved smoking but hated asking people for cigarettes so I would ask for her even though I don’t smoke. If shit went down somewhere she would always jump right into the action with no hesitation. She would tell the dumbest jokes and I was often the only one who would laugh. Four drinks was enough to make her hurl. she always said no when I offered weed, but insisted she did smoke weed. She shoplifted a lot and shared an article heavily on social media when the sentencing for shoplifting gor stricter in our county. She encouraged me to try new things. When I was with her I felt bold in a way I never felt before. She took me to a mosh pit and my legs were covered in bruises. She convinced me to take a stand up class. My rough patch ended. We hung out even more. 

I remember one night at a bonfire I looked over at her. She was smoking a cigarette with a group of her friends, she was facing the fire and I realized I had the biggest crush on her. I knew I was attracted to other women, I’ve even been on a few dates but to actually flirt and ask out a girl I was friends with was totally foreign. With a guy I knew if he got more touchy it meant he was interested but I could never tell if she was being flirty with me or if we were just good friends.

One night, her and I went to a book talk.I loved the author but truly  I could only focus on her sitting next to me. I was trying to work up the courage to put my arm around her. I felt like some idiot teenage boy trying to learn how to flirt. Then suddenly she just fully fell into my soldier and made this really cute noise. I put my arm around her and held her the rest of the talk. Afterwards she told me she gets cold so easily and was so happy to have me there. I should’ve asked you out that night but I was too stupid.

Whenever she wore heels she started reaching for my hand when she needed support

She convinced me to do a “couples costume” on halloween. She offered me and nobody else gum when she arrived at the party, maybe that meant nothing. Maybe my breath stank, maybe she wanted to make out.

We got together with some of our friends and she shared that the women she had been going on dates with were all giving her the ick and she wasnt sure about dating apps anymore. We had plans to see a movie later that week. I resolved that after the movie was over I’d offer to buy her a drink. If she said no, she’d say no but id stop analyzing every interaction. Maybe it would make things weird but I felt ready.

Then her dad died. She sent me a voice note saying she was heading back to live with her mom(four hours away).I tried texting her to check in a few days later. No response. I told her I wanted to send her a christmas gift. No response. I stopped texting her cuz I figured she needed space. I so wanted to be there for her like she was there for me but her grieving process just isn’t about me at the end of the day.

 Then on new years day she texted me saying she missed me. We started texting more often again, she sent me her address. She surprised me and our mutual friends with a visit last month but only stayed in town for a few hours. She told us she didn’t have any plans to move back to us anymore.

She likes every instagram story I post but she stopped responding to my texts a couple weeks ago. I want to send a how are you but I feel like I’m just being desperate. I feel like shit. I feel selfish. Her dad died. Thats whats important. She's going through hell i'm sure but I just cant seem to move on. I miss her so much. I try to distract myself with work and school.
